          "bodyText": "With the aura of his star power fading, the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, and his governing Liberal party are aiming to extend their parliamentary majority for another four years. As summer winds down, all party leaders are effectively in campaign mode and the prime minister is expected to officially call the election in the coming days. Under current rules, opposition parties will have less than two months to shake the incumbent Liberals from government as they travel the country to woo voters. The election is predicted to be an acrimonious affair, say pollsters. And as Canadians prepare for the mudslinging, a number of issues are expected to dominate the campaign. The environment A spring of intense flooding in eastern parts of the country and wildfires raging in the west has brought new urgency to Canada\u2019s response to the climate crisis. \u201cFor the first time in at least the last 10 years, the environment is actually coming out as the top, unprompted national issue of concern, said Nik Nanos, head of the Canadian polling firm Nanos Research. \u201c[It\u2019s] outstripping both jobs and the economy and healthcare, which are the two traditional issues.\u201d In addition to a spate of natural disasters, Nanos credits a pitched battle in the country over carbon taxes for keeping the environment as a key electoral issue. Trudeau is likely to position himself as the leader best equipped to meet the country\u2019s climate obligations, despite the government being far off track for its Paris accord commitments. While the rival Conservative party has been widely panned for its lack of substantial environmental policies, Trudeau has also received vigorous pushback from climate activists. In late June, the government declared a climate emergency in the country \u2013 and then approved a multibillion-dollar oil pipeline expansion the following day. \u201cFor the Trudeau government to approve this pipeline after declaring a climate emergency makes about as much sense as pouring gasoline on a burning fire,\u201d said Greenpeace campaigner Mike Hudema. Populism Amid rising tides of far-right populism in the US and Europe, the election will mark the first country-wide appearance of the People\u2019s Party of Canada \u2013 a rightwing splinter party led by the former Conservative minister Maxime Bernier.

If an election was held in the coming days, he said, \u201cthe Greens are very close to the point where they could be the power-broker that kept to a minority government in play.\u201d Recent electoral success in local and provincial elections has buoyed support for the party and polling also suggests that Elizabeth May, the Green leader \u2013 and most seasoned politician currently in federal politics \u2013 remains the most popular leader in the country.

It would have been just about bearable were it not for the European council president\u2019s caption: \u201cMelania, Brigitte, Ma\u0142gosia and Akie \u2013 the light side of the Force.\u201d It is a statement that says so much: these women are the summer to the winter of us men, the fragility to our strength, the light side of our force.

It is a world view that is slightly more textured than an assumption that women are wives first and independent beings second. There is the whiff of a heteronormative code, too: if the wives aren\u2019t going to do much more than look into the middle distance, their real purpose on the trip is to prove that the husband is a red-blooded fellow.

To be fair, the Amazon is on fire; it would not be unreasonable to imagine France having made a suggestion about the world\u2019s lungs and Bolsonaro retorting with some fresh idiocy. But, in fact, the president of Brazil had liked a post on social media that suggested that his wife, Michelle, was hotter than Macron\u2019s, and that this explained the diplomatic tension. Bolsonaro did more than like the post. He replied: \u201cDo not humiliate the guy, ha ha,\u201d adding that piquant stone-age layer wherein a man\u2019s virility is conveyed by the hotness of his wife. It is like an anxiety dream, hurtling so fast back to pre-civilisation, grabbing the memory of Michelle Obama\u2019s sass as we go.

          "body": "<p>As Donald Trump\u2019s America retreats from global leadership, coalitions of like-minded nations are attempting to limit the damage. One such grouping at this weekend\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/g7\" title=\"\">G7 summit</a> in France managed a breakthrough over one of the globe\u2019s most pressing problems: the accelerating deforestation in the Amazon. Conserving rainforests is necessary if there is to be any chance of limiting global heating to 1.5 degrees Celsius. It\u2019s not just humanity at stake \u2013 the Amazon contains <a href=\"http://wwf.panda.org/knowledge_hub/where_we_work/amazon/about_the_amazon/\" title=\"\">at least 10% of the Earth\u2019s biodiversity</a>. So it was good to see France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron take Brazil\u2019s far-right president Jair Bolsonaro to task for encouraging the wanton destruction of the world\u2019s biggest tropical forest.</p> <p>The rules-based order worked though Trumpish pre-emptive tweets: \u201cOur house is burning. Literally,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EmmanuelMacron/status/1164617008962527232\" title=\"\">wrote</a> Mr Macron last week; \u201cIt is an international crisis,\u201d added Justin Trudeau, Canada\u2019s prime minister. Mr Bolsonaro attempted to brazen it out. However, his opposition melted away as the heat was turned up over 24 hours. Mr Macron, along with Ireland\u2019s Leo Varadkar, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/23/amazon-fires-global-leaders-urged-divert-brazil-suicide-path\" title=\"\">threatened</a> to veto a trade deal between the EU and Mercosur, the South American economic bloc in which Brazil is the biggest player. Both European nations\u2019 trading interests aligned with concern for the Amazon, but the pressure worked. By Friday Mr Bolsonaro had ordered the armed forces to fight a worrying spate of forest fires. Even the White House <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-praises-bolsonaro-says-us-can-help-stop-amazon-fires-2019-8?r=US&amp;IR=T\" title=\"\">offered</a> to help with saving the rainforest.</p> <p>This is a tactical victory for the planet \u2013 and one shamefully not won by the UK, which appears to be more fixated on securing its own post-Brexit trade arrangements than standing up for what is right. Much more will have to be done to change Mr Bolsonaro\u2019s mind over the threat posed by the climate crisis. The Brazilian president, who took power in January, has appointed climate deniers to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/15/brazil-foreign-minister-ernesto-araujo-climate-change-marxist-plot\" title=\"\">prominent roles</a>. When the country\u2019s National Institute for Space Research revealed increasing deforestation in the Amazon in July \u2013 a result of the <a href=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2018/07/deforestation-skyrockets-in-the-amazon-rainforest/\" title=\"\">rollback</a> of environmental protections and enforcement \u2013 the president said the numbers were fake. He then <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2019/08/03/americas/brazil-space-institute-director-fired-amazon-deforestation-intl/index.html\" title=\"\">sacked</a> the head of the institute, shooting the messenger rather than acting on the message. The rate of destruction has brought the Amazon close to a dangerous threshold \u2013 where it becomes too small to generate its own clouds. As the trees disappear, rainfall declines and deforestation begins to feed on itself; this could push it to a point of no return, where the vast basin would end up <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2019/08/wildfires-in-amazon-caused-by-deforestation/\" title=\"\">resembling</a> a savannah more than a rainforest. Mr Bolsonaro sees the Amazon as a \u201cvirgin\u201d that should be \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/28/world/americas/brazil-deforestation-amazon-bolsonaro.html\" title=\"\">exploited</a>\u201d by big business.</p> <p>With the Brazilian economy still <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-economy-gdp/brazils-gdp-shrinks-economy-flirts-with-another-recession-idUSKCN1T01JI\" title=\"\">struggling</a> to pull out of a long slump, he is looking for ways to turbocharge economic growth, but at least some of the world\u2019s leaders have signalled \u2013 and rightly so \u2013 that this cannot be at any price for the planet. A small number of nations hold the world\u2019s rainforests, with Brazil home to one-third and about 15% shared by Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of Congo. More tropical tree cover was <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2018/06/tropical-deforestation-forest-loss-2017/\" title=\"\">lost globally</a> in both 2016 and 2017 than in any other year this century.</p> <p>Preserving rainforests, and restoring former forested land, is an economical way to meet climate change targets. The G7 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/26/g7-leaders-agree-plan-to-help-amazon-countries-fight-wildfires\" title=\"\">aid package</a> to help Amazon countries fight wildfires is a start. But targets and protections are only effective when they are strictly applied. Europeans need to change their diets to reduce demand for carbon-intensive foodstuffs. They also ought to restrict market access unless conservation policies are reintroduced along with laws that can be enforced with transparent monitoring. The world urgently needs a new pattern of development: Brazil has become stuck in a <a href=\"http://www.hrpub.org/download/20180130/AEB4-11810583.pdf\" title=\"\">middle-income trap</a>, with per-capita GDP hovering around 30% of the US level. We need an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/25/g7-cant-turn-blind-eye-to-amazon-ecocide-forest-fires-indigenous-tribes\" title=\"\">economic system</a> where the forest is valued as highly as the field, and in which natural assets are nurtured for the long term. It is a better way forward than every country putting itself first.</p>",

          "bodyText": "As Donald Trump\u2019s America retreats from global leadership, coalitions of like-minded nations are attempting to limit the damage. One such grouping at this weekend\u2019s G7 summit in France managed a breakthrough over one of the globe\u2019s most pressing problems: the accelerating deforestation in the Amazon. Conserving rainforests is necessary if there is to be any chance of limiting global heating to 1.5 degrees Celsius. It\u2019s not just humanity at stake \u2013 the Amazon contains at least 10% of the Earth\u2019s biodiversity. So it was good to see France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron take Brazil\u2019s far-right president Jair Bolsonaro to task for encouraging the wanton destruction of the world\u2019s biggest tropical forest. The rules-based order worked though Trumpish pre-emptive tweets: \u201cOur house is burning. Literally,\u201d wrote Mr Macron last week; \u201cIt is an international crisis,\u201d added Justin Trudeau, Canada\u2019s prime minister. Mr Bolsonaro attempted to brazen it out. However, his opposition melted away as the heat was turned up over 24 hours. Mr Macron, along with Ireland\u2019s Leo Varadkar, threatened to veto a trade deal between the EU and Mercosur, the South American economic bloc in which Brazil is the biggest player. Both European nations\u2019 trading interests aligned with concern for the Amazon, but the pressure worked. By Friday Mr Bolsonaro had ordered the armed forces to fight a worrying spate of forest fires. Even the White House offered to help with saving the rainforest. This is a tactical victory for the planet \u2013 and one shamefully not won by the UK, which appears to be more fixated on securing its own post-Brexit trade arrangements than standing up for what is right. Much more will have to be done to change Mr Bolsonaro\u2019s mind over the threat posed by the climate crisis. The Brazilian president, who took power in January, has appointed climate deniers to prominent roles. When the country\u2019s National Institute for Space Research revealed increasing deforestation in the Amazon in July \u2013 a result of the rollback of environmental protections and enforcement \u2013 the president said the numbers were fake. He then sacked the head of the institute, shooting the messenger rather than acting on the message. The rate of destruction has brought the Amazon close to a dangerous threshold \u2013 where it becomes too small to generate its own clouds. As the trees disappear, rainfall declines and deforestation begins to feed on itself; this could push it to a point of no return, where the vast basin would end up resembling a savannah more than a rainforest. Mr Bolsonaro sees the Amazon as a \u201cvirgin\u201d that should be \u201cexploited\u201d by big business. With the Brazilian economy still struggling to pull out of a long slump, he is looking for ways to turbocharge economic growth, but at least some of the world\u2019s leaders have signalled \u2013 and rightly so \u2013 that this cannot be at any price for the planet. A small number of nations hold the world\u2019s rainforests, with Brazil home to one-third and about 15% shared by Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of Congo. More tropical tree cover was lost globally in both 2016 and 2017 than in any other year this century. Preserving rainforests, and restoring former forested land, is an economical way to meet climate change targets. The G7 aid package to help Amazon countries fight wildfires is a start. But targets and protections are only effective when they are strictly applied. Europeans need to change their diets to reduce demand for carbon-intensive foodstuffs. They also ought to restrict market access unless conservation policies are reintroduced along with laws that can be enforced with transparent monitoring. The world urgently needs a new pattern of development: Brazil has become stuck in a middle-income trap, with per-capita GDP hovering around 30% of the US level. We need an economic system where the forest is valued as highly as the field, and in which natural assets are nurtured for the long term. It is a better way forward than every country putting itself first.",

According to diplomatic sources, Trump argued strenuously that Vladimir Putin should be invited back, five years after Russia was ejected from the then G8) for its annexation of Crimea.</p> \n<p>Of the other leaders around the table, only Giuseppe Conte, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/20/italian-pm-expected-resign-giuseppe-conte\">outgoing Italian prime minister</a>, offered Trump any support, according to this account.

Boxed in by multiple global crises, the group of major industrialised democracies is arguably at its most divided since its founding in 1977.</p> \n<p>Trump has been arguing for Russian readmission since the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/08/donald-trump-shows-no-sign-compromise-flies-in-g7-summit\">G7 summit in Quebec</a> last year and appeared determined to revive the demand, bringing it up in a discussion about Iran policy and taking his counterparts by surprise with the vehemence of his views on the subject.</p> \n<p>There was nervousness about Trump\u2019s arrival, in the midst of a trade war with China and his <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2019/08/23/politics/donald-trump-g7-attendance/index.html\">reported</a><a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2019/08/23/politics/donald-trump-g7-attendance/index.html\"> reluctance</a> to attend, arguing it was not a good use of his time. At the previous summit in Quebec, Trump left early and ordered US officials to withdraw his agreement to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/10/g7-in-disarray-after-trump-rejects-communique-and-attacks-weak-trudeau\">joint communiqu\u00e9</a>. As a precaution this year, Macron decreed there would be no communiqu\u00e9 to withdraw from.</p> \n<p>In an attempt to win over Trump, Macron staged a benign ambush as the US president arrived, whisking him off to an unscheduled lunch, where the two men talked without officials or aides for nearly two hours.</p> \n<p>Trump later tweeted that it was \u201cthe best meeting we have yet had\u201d, though he misspelt the French president\u2019s name and accidentally linked to a parody Macron account, which has since been suspended.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b46a7043-44ea-4fe3-a994-395319b5c515\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Meeting regularly since 1976, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/g7\">G7</a> is made up of seven countries: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US. Between them, the countries represent around half of the world\u2019s GDP, and the group\u2019s main purpose is to provide a forum for discussing world economic stability. The first meetings grew out of a series of summits to deal with the 1973 oil crisis.</p>\n    <p>G7 summits take place annually, with the host nation rotating between the members. Summits are usually attended by leaders, finance ministers and central bank governors. As well as the seven nations, the meetings are also usually attended by leaders from the European Union, and representatives from international financial institutions including the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.

          "bodyText": "Donald Trump has rowed with his fellow G7 leaders over his demand that Russia be readmitted to the group, rejecting arguments that it should remain an association of liberal democracies, according to diplomats at the summit in Biarritz. The disagreement led to heated exchanges at a dinner on Saturday night inside the seaside resort\u2019s 19th-century lighthouse. According to diplomatic sources, Trump argued strenuously that Vladimir Putin should be invited back, five years after Russia was ejected from the then G8) for its annexation of Crimea. Of the other leaders around the table, only Giuseppe Conte, the outgoing Italian prime minister, offered Trump any support, according to this account. Shinzo Abe of Japan was neutral. The rest \u2013 the UK\u2019s Boris Johnson, Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel, Canada\u2019s Justin Trudeau, the EU council president, Donald Tusk, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron \u2013 pushed back firmly against the suggestion. \u201cOn that point \u2026 it became a bit tense to say the least,\u201d a European diplomat said. \u201cMost of the other leaders insisted on this being a family, a club, a community of liberal democracies and for that reason they said you cannot allow President Putin \u2013 who does not represent that \u2013 back in.\u201d \u201cThat is not such a very important thing for [Trump]. He doesn\u2019t share that view,\u201d the diplomat added. According to this account Trump argued that on issues such as Iran, Syria and North Korea, it made sense to have Russia in the room. \u201cSo he had a really kind of fundamental difference about this.\u201d The summit is being hosted on Biarritz\u2019s Atlantic seafront, which has been entirely sealed off for the event. Encouraged by warm breezes and mostly sunny skies, several of the leaders chose to walk from their grand hotel to the venue for the talks along the deserted and heavily guarded beach in front of the city\u2019s casino. In breaks in the negotiations, they have been treated to the best of the Basque region\u2019s cuisine, prepared by top local chefs and kitchen staff from the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace. Below the pleasantly gilded surface, however, there has been an undercurrent of bitterness and anxiety at the summit. Boxed in by multiple global crises, the group of major industrialised democracies is arguably at its most divided since its founding in 1977. Trump has been arguing for Russian readmission since the G7 summit in Quebec last year and appeared determined to revive the demand, bringing it up in a discussion about Iran policy and taking his counterparts by surprise with the vehemence of his views on the subject. There was nervousness about Trump\u2019s arrival, in the midst of a trade war with China and his reported reluctance to attend, arguing it was not a good use of his time. At the previous summit in Quebec, Trump left early and ordered US officials to withdraw his agreement to a joint communiqu\u00e9. As a precaution this year, Macron decreed there would be no communiqu\u00e9 to withdraw from. In an attempt to win over Trump, Macron staged a benign ambush as the US president arrived, whisking him off to an unscheduled lunch, where the two men talked without officials or aides for nearly two hours. Trump later tweeted that it was \u201cthe best meeting we have yet had\u201d, though he misspelt the French president\u2019s name and accidentally linked to a parody Macron account, which has since been suspended. Macron\u2019s tactics infuriated some US officials, who called several members of the travelling White House press on Saturday afternoon to leak against the French host, claiming he had filled the summit agenda with \u201cniche\u201d subjects such as climate change and equality with his own domestic audience in mind, rather than sticking to global economics and trade, which have traditionally been the focus of G7 meetings. Speaking anonymously, the officials also claimed it was only on US insistence that there would be a summit session on economics and trade at all, a claim denied by the French, and undermined by the existence of earlier drafts of the agenda, which all had such a session included. When the time came for the leaders to gather outside the 1830s lighthouse, dating from the reign of King Louis Philippe, a scheduled group photo was unexpectedly cancelled. The reason for the cancellation was not explained, though officials pointed out there was a bigger family photo, including invited guest leaders from India, Australia, Spain, South Africa and several other African states. Not included was a surprise guest who flew in on Sunday afternoon: the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, at the invitation of his French counterpart, Jean-Yves Le Drian. France has been pursuing an initiative to defuse tensions in the Gulf, and French officials said Zarif\u2019s sudden appearance was a continuation of those efforts. They insisted Trump had been informed of the unexpected arrival. The US president refused to comment. Next year it will be Trump\u2019s turn to choose outside guests as he takes his turn at hosting the G7 against the backdrop of his re-election campaign. European diplomats on Sunday were betting that Putin would be on top of his list.",

          "bodyText": "French president Emmanuel Macron has said he hopes to convince world leaders to pull back from trade war and heal growing divisions at the G7 summit in Biarritz, despite signs that will be a daunting task. The leaders of the major industrialised democracies gathered in the French Atlantic resort amid global crises, deep rifts within the group and increasingly erratic behaviour by Donald Trump. \u201cThere is still no certainty whether the group will be able to find common solutions, and the global challenges are today really serious, or whether it will focus on senseless disputes among each other,\u201d European council president Donald Tusk said in a strikingly dour assessment of the summit\u2019s chances of success. \u201cThe last years have shown that it is increasingly difficult for all of us to find common language when the world needs our cooperation more, not less. This may be the last moment to restore our political community.\u201d Those difficulties emerged just hours after Trump arrived in France, with US officials accusing the French president of focusing the summit on what they called \u201cniche\u201d issues such as climate change, gender equality and development in Africa. The topics were chosen specifically to appeal to Macron\u2019s domestic audience and supporters, they said, according to multiple US media reports. At an opening dinner of Basque cuisine in a 19th-century lighthouse, Macron was expected to seek consensus and potentially common action among guests including Tusk and the leaders of the US, UK, Germany, Canada, Japan and Italy. \u201cWe are going to talk about the great conflicts: Iran, Syria, Libya and Ukraine,\u201d Macron said. He was also expected to raise the ecological catastrophe unfolding in the Amazon and the threat of global recession caused by tit-for-tat tariffs leading to full-blown trade wars. Trump has been a common factor in all the crises, on which he is mostly at odds with other leaders. Before leaving for Biarritz, the American president imposed new tariffs on China and invoked a national security law in a threat to force US companies to stop doing business there. Trump has so far resisted pressure from his fellow leaders to return to the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, which he abandoned last year, leading to an accelerating rise in tensions in the Persian Gulf. And running counter to a European effort to force Jair Bolsonaro to change policies on the Amazon contributing to deforestation and catastrophic wildfires, Trump has embraced the far-right Brazilian leader, sending him an encouraging tweet before leaving Washington. \u201cOur future Trade prospects are very exciting and our relationship is strong, perhaps stronger than ever before,\u201d Trump wrote. The US president is also at odds with other leaders on Russia, which was ejected from what was the G8 because of military aggression in Ukraine. Trump has repeatedly pushed for Russia to be allowed to rejoin. \u201cOne year ago, in Canada, President Trump suggested reinviting Russia to G7, stating openly that Crimea\u2019s annexation by Russia was partially justified,\u201d Tusk said in remarks that were bitterly critical of the US president. \u201cAnd that we should accept this fact. Under no condition can we agree with this logic.\u201d Clouds were also gathering over a potential spat with the EU over digital tax after Trump said he could decide to retaliate for France raising a levy on web companies such as Google by taxing French wines \u201clike they\u2019ve never seen before\u201d. The lack of unity has led Macron to abandon efforts to draft a comprehensive joint statement for the end of the summit. Some senior officials charged with planning the summit have not bothered to attend some preparatory meetings, according to two officials at the summit. Before the opening dinner, Macron, Tusk, Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel, new UK prime minister Boris Johnson and outgoing Italian premier Giuseppe Conte held a meeting in an effort to coordinate their positions. Johnson, at odds with the EU over the terms of UK withdrawal, has also been courted by Trump, who called him on Friday \u201cto discuss a range of foreign policy and trade issues\u201d, the White House said. Macron had an unscheduled lunch with Trump. After bumping into the US leader and his wife, Melania, in a hotel lobby shortly after they landed, he offered Trump a meal on an ocean-front terrace in order to prepare some of the summit\u2019s thorniest issues. These included the war in Syria, the Iran nuclear treaty, Ukraine, the Amazon fires, the climate emergency and trade wars. The leaders sat at a table adorned with flowers, Macron saying their priority was to discuss the stand-off with Iran, with \u201cstrong coordination\u201d and \u201chard work\u201d needed. Trump at first appeared to be sitting arms crossed and frosty, but went on to praise his host and the beauty of Biarritz. \u201cWe actually have a lot in common,\u201d Trump said, adding that he and Macron had \u201cbeen friends for a long time\u201d. Trump admitted that at times he and Macron \u201cgo at each other a little bit\u201d but said they had a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d. He added: \u201cSo far, so good. The weather is perfect. Everybody\u2019s getting along. I think we will accomplish a lot this weekend.\u201d The issue of how to bring Trump on board is a main concern among G7 diplomats. Macron had already scrapped the idea of a joint statement, after Trump pulled out of the joint statement last year in Canada, in a fury at prime minister Justin Trudeau.

The post refers to the New York Times as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/10/24/the-ugly-history-of-luegenpresse-a-nazi-slur-shouted-at-a-trump-rally/\">lugenpresse</a>\u201d, a German term meaning \u201clying press\u201d that was adopted by the Nazis to stigmatize Jews, communists, and critics of <strong>Adolf Hitler</strong>. In recent years the slur has regained popularity within the far right and white nationalists. The blog post also uses the word \u201ckritarch\u201d to refer to judges, a reference to a system of governance involving rule by judges in ancient Israeli history and an apparent invocation of anti-semitism.</p> <p>\u201cVDare\u2019s use of the term in a pejorative manner casts Jewish history in a negative light as an Anti-Semitic trope of Jews seeking power and control,\u201d Ashley Tabaddor, the union president, wrote in a letter to the EOIR about the incident, according to BuzzFeed News. \u201cPublication and dissemination of a white supremacist, anti-semitic website throughout the EOIR is antithetical to the goals and ideals of the Department of Justice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe daily EOIR morning news briefings are compiled by a contractor and the blog post should not have been included,\u201d a spokesman for the justice department told BuzzFeed News. </p> <p>VDare is a virulently anti-immigrant website that promotes white nationalism, white supremacy and anti-Semitism. It was founded by <strong>Peter Brimelow</strong>, a British immigrant to the US, and is named after Virginia Dare, who is supposed to be the first English child born in the Americas.

Eight years later, Trump\u2019s victory has energized grassroots activists and liberals determined to see him removed from office. </p> <p>Ezra Levin, a co-founder of the progressive group Indivisible, which is pushing Democrats to adopt such reforms, said the op-ed was a sign McConnell is starting to fear the tactic. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ezralevin/status/1164526819745435648\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">HOLY MOLY.

Former White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders will join Fox News in September. The DNC rejected a proposal to host a presidential primary debate on climate change. Former Republican congressman Joe Walsh said he is considering a primary challenge against Trump. Former Rhode Island governor Lincoln Chafee said he might run as a Libertarian. The department of justice distributed a link to an antisemitic blog post on VDare, a white nationalist website, in an email sent to immigration court employees. Democratic presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke endorsed the proposal by youth gun violence prevention activists March for our Lives to reexamine the supreme court\u2019s current interpretation of the second amendment. The day before the deadly attack against Latinos in El Paso, Texas governor Greg Abbott sent out an anti-immigrant fundraising letter calling on Republicans to \u201cDEFEND TEXAS NOW\u201d and \u201ctake matters into our own hands\u201d. Customs and Border Patrol agents are searching for a 3-year-old boy who is believed missing after attempting to cross the Rio Grande near the Eagle Pass border crossing in Texas. The child and his mother are believed to be part of a group of 12 migrants who were seen attempting to cross the river at 1:30am on 20 August. Members of the group reported that the pair were swept away by the current, CBP said. The body of a 28-year-old Honduran woman, believed to be the toddler\u2019s mother, was recovered yesterday. \u201cThis is heartbreaking tragedy that occurs too often,\u201d said Del Rio Sector Chief Patrol Agent Raul L Ortiz in a statement. \u201cBorder Patrol agents are using all available resources in the search for the missing boy.\u201d The Eagle Pass border crossing is just a few miles from the site of the drowning of a father and his 23-old-month daughter in June. Their lifeless bodies, floating amid reeds, were captured in a devastating photograph that was published widely by media outlets hoping to draw attention to the unnecessary peril created by US policy on the southern border. Migrants have the right to request asylum under US law and international treaties. However, the Trump administration has drastically reduced the number of people it will allow to apply for asylum at border crossings, creating a massive backlog that has forced many migrants to remain in Mexico for month \u2013 or risk a treacherous river crossing. Former Congressman and Democratic presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke told the Guardian on Thursday he supports a proposal by the March for our Lives, a group of youth gun violence prevention activists, to reexamine the supreme court\u2019s current interpretation of the second amendment right to bear arms. O\u2019Rourke was the first Democratic 2020 candidate to support March for Our Lives\u2019 ambitious new policy agenda for gun control reform. His campaign did not back away from the most controversial elements of the youth activists\u2019 plan, including their desire to revisit the supreme court\u2019s current interpretation of the second amendment, enshrined in the 2009 District of Columbia v Heller decision, which found that Americans have an individual right to own handguns in their homes for self defense. \u201cWhile Beto agrees with the court\u2019s holding that the second amendment allows for regulation, he does not agree with the entirety of the Heller decision,\u201d National Press Secretary Aleigha Cavalier said in a statement. \u201cOne piece of the Heller case Beto believes should be revisited is the court\u2019s decision to strike down DC\u2019s safe storage requirements.\u201d Hillary Clinton\u2019s made similar arguments about \u201csafe storage requirements\u201d and the Heller decision during her 2016 presidential campaign. Asked explicitly if O\u2019Rourke \u201cbelieves the second amendment should be interpreted to guarantee Americans the right to own handguns in their home for self defense, or not,\u201d the campaign dodged giving any clear answer. \u201cBeto believes the second amendment allows for the reasonable regulation of firearms, and as president, will appoint judges that uphold that belief.\u201d Kathryn Mattingly, assistant press secretary for the Executive Office for Immigration Review, just provided the Guardian with the following statement in response to BuzzFeed News\u2019s startling report that the government agency distributed a link to a white nationalist website: \u201cThe daily EOIR morning news briefings are compiled by a contractor and the blog post should not have been included. The Department of Justice condemns Anti-Semitism in the strongest terms.\u201d Hello all, this is Julia Carrie Wong in San Francisco, picking up the live blog for the rest of the day. BuzzFeed News just published an astonishing report about the distribution of a link to a white nationalist website by the US Department of Justice. According to the report, the Executive Office for Immigration Review included a link to a blog post on the white nationalist website VDare in a morning news briefing that was emailed to immigration court employees earlier this week. The blog post is about an effort to dissolve the National Association of Immigration Judges, a union representing employees of the immigration courts. The post refers to the New York Times as \u201clugenpresse\u201d, a German term meaning \u201clying press\u201d that was adopted by the Nazis to stigmatize Jews, communists, and critics of Adolf Hitler. In recent years the slur has regained popularity within the far right and white nationalists. The blog post also uses the word \u201ckritarch\u201d to refer to judges, a reference to a system of governance involving rule by judges in ancient Israeli history and an apparent invocation of anti-semitism. \u201cVDare\u2019s use of the term in a pejorative manner casts Jewish history in a negative light as an Anti-Semitic trope of Jews seeking power and control,\u201d Ashley Tabaddor, the union president, wrote in a letter to the EOIR about the incident, according to BuzzFeed News. \u201cPublication and dissemination of a white supremacist, anti-semitic website throughout the EOIR is antithetical to the goals and ideals of the Department of Justice.\u201d \u201cThe daily EOIR morning news briefings are compiled by a contractor and the blog post should not have been included,\u201d a spokesman for the justice department told BuzzFeed News. VDare is a virulently anti-immigrant website that promotes white nationalism, white supremacy and anti-Semitism. It was founded by Peter Brimelow, a British immigrant to the US, and is named after Virginia Dare, who is supposed to be the first English child born in the Americas. The Southern Poverty Law Center describes it as an \u201can anti-immigration hate website\u201d. The justice department did not immediately respond to additional queries from the Guardian. I\u2019m signing off for the day and handing over the reigns to my talented colleague, Julia Wong. Thanks for sticking with us through what has proved to be a slow but steady news days. Here\u2019s a roundup of the biggest news of the day. One-term Republican congressman and radio show host Joe Walsh said he is \u201cstrongly\u201d considering a primary run against Trump. Meanwhile, former Rhode Island governor Lincoln Chafee says he might run as a Libertarian. Jay Inslee ended his presidential bid and announced he would seek a third term as governor of Washington state. John Hickenlooper, the former Colorado governor who ended his campaign earlier this month, announced he would run for Senate. Former White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders today became the latest senior Trump official to join Fox News. Her first appearance will be on Fox &amp; Friends on 6 September. The DNC rejected a proposal to host a presidential primary debate centered on climate change, disappointing activists and progressive who had pushed for one. US senator Chris Murphy has revived hopes of action on background check legislation in Congress. After speaking to the White House, he tweeted that the White House has \u201cnot walked away\u201d despite Trump\u2019s near-daily shifts on the issue. Connecticut senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat who became a leading champion of gun control in the wake of the Newtown shooting, has revived hope of action on background checks after Trump appeared to walk back his support. Trump has shifted his opinion on expanding background checks on all firearms purchases, initially throwing his support behind such reforms after back-to-back mass shootings left 31 people dead in Texas and Ohio earlier this month. But this week, after reportedly being lobbied by the NRA and conservative lawmakers, Trump waffled. According to Murphy, the door is still open for action on background checks, which maintains broad support from the American public, including Republicans. We\u2019re standing by for Donald Trump to present the Medal of Freedom to Bob Cousy. Earlier on Thursday, Bernie Sanders visited Paradise, the California town devastated by a wildfire that left 86 people dead. The tour came after Sanders unveiled one of the most sweeping climate plans. After Trump reportedly joked about trading Greenland for Puerto Rico \u2013 residents of the US territory considered the deal. Mostly in jest, some Puerto Ricans called themselves \u201cCaribbean Vikings\u201d and posted memes about the swap. NBC News rounded up a few of the best reactions here. The Democratic National Committee has voted to reject a resolution to host a primary debate singularly focused on climate change, despite mounting calls for one from activists and candidates as the risks posed by global warming become a top priority for voters. At a party conference in San Francisco on Thursday, top DNC officials voted 17 to 8 against a resolution that would have dedicated one of the 12 Democratic debates entirely to the issue. \u201cClimate is such an intersectional issue. It allows us to talk about jobs, economics, racial disparities, healthcare, national security,\u201d said Tina Podlodowski, the chair of the Washington State Democrats and the author of the resolution calling for a climate debate. \u201cAnd then of course there\u2019s that little issue of the very survival of our species.\u201d Symone Sanders, a senior adviser to presidential candidate Joe Biden, argued against the measure, saying that the DNC would be falling into \u201cdangerous territory\u201d if it changed party rules to allow for the climate debate. Others cited concerns about opening the door for a flood of single-issue events. Mose candidates, including Biden, have said they are open to a debate centered on combatting climate change. The presidential candidate who fought hardest for the debate, Jay Inslee, suspended his campaign on Wednesday to run for governor. CNN will host a climate town hall before the third presidential debate next month, and MSNBC has partnered with a handful of organizations to host a multi-day forum with candidates on the subject. After the resolution failed to pass, activists with the youth-led Sunrise Movement disrupted the meeting and began to sing Which Side Are You On.

But Trump\u2019s claim that he is the \u201cchosen one\u201d as he defended a trade war with China was enough to shock a the best-trained Jedi in the galaxy. Overstock CEO Partick Byrne resigned from the online retailer on Thursday after his controversial comments about on his involvement with the \u201cdeep state\u201d following the disclosure of an affair with a woman accused of being a Russian agent. The company\u2019s shares, which had fallen in the wake of Byrne\u2019s comments, rose sharply amid news of his departure. In July I came forward to a small set of journalists regarding my involvement in certain government matters. Doing so was not my first choice, but I was reminded of the damage done to our nation for three years and felt my duty as a citizen precluded me from staying silent any longer. Though patriotic Americans are writing me in support, my presence may affect and complicate all manner of business relationships, from insurability to strategic discussions regarding our retail business. Thus, while I believe that I did what was necessary for the good of the country, for the good of the firm, I am in the sad position of having to sever ties with Overstock, both as CEO and board member, effective Thursday August 22,\u201d Byrne, who founded the company 20 years ago, wrote in a letter to shareholders. His tenure was thrown into uncertainty after he revealed that he had been romantically involved with Maria Butina, a Russian operative currently serving an 18-month prison sentence for trying to infiltrate American politics through her connections with the National Rifle Association. He disclosed their relationship in a press release titled \u201cOverstock.com CEO Comments on Deep State, Withholds Further Comment\u201d in which referred to federal agents as \u201cMen in Black\u201d and said he assisted in the \u201cClinton investigation\u201d and the \u201cRussia investigation\u201d. The Sunrise Movement, a youth-led organization behind the Green New Deal, has endorsed Massachusetts senator Ed Markey amid rumors that congressman Joe Kennedy III is considering mounting a primary bid for the seat. Earlier this year, Markey, 73, shored up his progressive credentials by linking arms with New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to introduce a Green New Deal in the Senate. At 38, Kennedy, grandson of Robert Kennedy, is the youngest member of the family\u2019s political dynasty. A primary between Markey and Kennedy could serve as a test for Democrats at a time when a new generation of young progressives are challenging the party\u2019s Old Guard. In this context, the endorsement from the Sunrise Movement sends a signal to voters that the senator can appeal to the party\u2019s activist base and that he is committed to the issues energizing the grassroots. The sprawling Democratic field has winnowed slightly with the departures of Inslee and Hickenlooper. But there are still 22 Democrats running \u2013 and less than half have met the fundraising and polling threshhold to qualify for the third debate in Houston next month. The urgent question now is who will be the next to go? Ten candidate will appear on stage in Houston, including Juli\u00e1n Castro who just qualified this week thanks to a new CNN poll showing him at 2% nationally. The other top tier candidates to make the cut \u2013 and are therefore less likely to drop out anytime soon \u2013 are: former vice president Joe Biden, senator Bernie Sanders, senator Elizabeth Warren, senator Kamala Harris, senator Cory Booker, mayor Pete Buttigieg, senator Amy Klobuchar, former congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke and entrepreneur Andrew Yang. To qualify, the Democratic candidates must receive at least 130,000 contributions from individual donors and earned 2% support in at least four acceptable polls. Billionaire Tom Steyer, the field\u2019s most recent entrant, is one poll away from making the debate stage while Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard needs two more polls. New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand is just shy of the contributions threshold and still needs three more polls and self-help guru Marianne Williamson has enough contributors but needs to raise her polling numbers. The cutoff date for the Houston debate \u2013 and a separate CNN town hall on climate change ahead of the debate \u2013 is 28 August. For candidates who have failed to break through and are struggling to raise money that might just be the end of the road. The possibilities include Gabbard, congressmen Seth Moulton and Tim Ryan, Colorado Senator Michael Bennet, New York mayor Bill de Blasio, Montana governor Steve Bullock. Former congressman John Delaney, who is self-funding his campaign, has not seen his numbers move, even after being given a relatively long time to make his case for a moderate healthcare plan during the last debate. Meanwhile, Williamson has had several break out moments on the debate stage to become an instant online meme, but it hasn\u2019t translated into hard support. There are also other considerations to take into account. Of the candidates who have dropped out, congressman Eric Swalwell, Hickenlooper and Inslee, all dropped out to turn their attention to home state races for House, Senate and the Governor\u2019s mansion, respectively. Would Bullock leave to run for senate in Montana as he\u2019s been encouraged to? Likewise, O\u2019Rourke is being urged to abandon his presidential ambitions and run for Senate in Texas. Let\u2019s cross the border for a second to talk about Canadian politics. Prime minister Justin Trudeau: young and charismatic with a tuft of brown hair envied by leaders the world over was celebrated as liberals best hope of regaining power in Canada when he ran for election in 2015. But after four years in power, \u201ccracks in his image have started to show,\u201d writes Ashifa Kassam. Some of the policies enacted by Trudeau\u2019s government have made his political identity seem hollow, even disingenuous. Compounding this has been the ongoing fallout from the most significant controversy of his tenure: Canada\u2019s ethics watchdog recently found that Trudeau broke the country\u2019s conflict of interest law in the hopes of allowing a giant engineering and construction firm to avoid a corruption trial. The company is facing charges in connection with millions of dollars in bribes allegedly paid to officials in Libya, including members of the Gaddafi regime, between 2001 and 2011. Don\u2019t miss this commentary from Barbra Streisand, a former lover of [Trudeau\u2019s father, former prime minister Pierre Trudeau], who once described him as a blend of \u201cMarlon Brando and Napoleon\u201d. In contrast, one critic had memorably dubbed Justin \u201cthe Paris Hilton of Canadian politics\u201d. Trump\u2019s offer to buy Greenland was mostly met with by the international community with derision and laughter \u2013 except, of course, in Greenland, where residents were perhaps unsurprisingly indignant. But not for the first time, his rhetoric has resonated with right-wing nationalist groups. In this case, it\u2019s the youth wing of the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA). According to a report in Politico, the group, which supports a separate Flemish state, has offered to sell the country\u2019s French-speaking region of Wallonia to Trump for a whopping \u20ac1. \u201cDear President, one Euro and Wallonia is yours. Call us,\u201d the youth branch of N-VA wrote on Twitter, tagging Trump, who has yet to reply. The group emphasized that the offer was only a joke and that there was no serious political strategy behind the comment. \u201cWe had absolutely no political message with this and did not want to provoke anything,\u201d the N-VA\u2019s youth president, Lawrence Vancraeyenest, said, according to Politico. \u201cThis was a joke, responding to current events, from a youth perspective.\u201d Jay Inslee announced he will seek a third term as governor of Washington state, a day after ending his 2020 presidential campaign singularly focused on climate change. We have provided the nation a road map for innovation, economic growth, and progressive action. And we\u2019re not done yet,\u201d Inslee wrote in an email to donors. \u201cI want to continue to stand with you in opposing Donald Trump and rejecting his hurtful and divisive agenda, while strengthening and enhancing Washington state\u2019s role as a progressive beacon for the nation. Which is why I\u2019m announcing today my intention to run for a third term as Washington\u2019s governor. Inslee, 68, had struggled to gain traction in a congested primary field. He was unlikely to qualify for the next month\u2019s debate in Houston, Texas, which would have precluded him from participating in a CNN town hall on climate change. \u201cIt\u2019s become clear that I\u2019m not going to be carrying the ball,\u201d Inslee said on MSNBC\u2019s The Rachel Maddow Show. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be the president, so I\u2019m withdrawing tonight from the race.\u201d Lincoln Chafee, the Republican US Senator turned Independent Rhode Island governor turned Democratic presidential candidate and a longtime proponent of the metric system, might try his luck running for president as a Libertarian in 2020. In an interview with the Daily Beast, Chafee said he was interested in running for president on a third-party ticket. \u201cI\u2019m very motivated as an anti-war American, and also by the deficit,\u201d Chafee, now a Libertarian living in Wyoming, told the news website \u201cThose are two big issues that, if the Libertarian convention next summer thinks that someone with a long record on those issues... if I fit that, then yes, I\u2019d be open to that.\u201d His decision would depend in part on whether Libertarian activists express enthusiasm for his candidacy.T \u201cI\u2019m new to the party and I\u2019m still meeting people through phone calls, email, and in person,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m at this stage learning what they might want.\u201d Read the full story here. And for even more background, I\u2019ve resurrected a write up from Chafee\u2019s 2016 campaign launch, which our reporter said came up a little short \u2013 even on a metric ruler. Trump\u2019s vision of a great Greenland Purchase was perhaps doomed from the start but that hasn\u2019t stopped Republicans from embracing the idea. The National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), the campaign arm of House Republicans is offering donors who contribute more than $25 a limited edition t-shirt that depicts Greenland as a 51st US state. Read more from Politco on the fundraising appeal. Donald Trump has had several press secretaries since taking office in 2017. His first, Sean Spicer that he will be a competitor on the next season of ABC\u2019s Dancing with the Stars. Spicer was followed Anthony Scaramucci, whose latest feud with the president has lasted longer than his employment as White House press secretary. Which brings us to Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Trump\u2019s longest-serving and most loyal press secretary. In perhaps the least surprising post-White House move, Sanders is joining Fox News as a contributor. She will make her debut appearance next month on the president\u2019s favorite show, Fox &amp; Friends. There she joins several former senior White House communications officials, including: Sanders will also join her father, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, who is a contributor on the network. The outstanding question: will she follow his footsteps and run for governor? Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is imploring Democrats not to eliminate the filibuster \u2013 a procedural rule that allows the minority party to stall or block the chamber from voting on legislation or a nominee. \u201cIf future Democrats shortsightedly decide to reduce the Senate to majority rule, we\u2019ll have lost a key safeguard of American government,\u201d the Kentucky Republican writes in an op-ed published in the New York Times. \u201cAnd \u2014 stop me if you\u2019ve heard this one \u2014 they\u2019d regret it a lot sooner than they think.\u201d The op-ed serves as as rejoinder to one written by former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who urged Democrats abolish the filibuster. \u201cThe Senate is now a place where the most pressing issues facing our country are disregarded, along with the will of the American people overwhelmingly calling for action,\u201d Reid wrote. \u201cThe future of our country is sacrificed at the altar of the filibuster.\u201d Democratic activists have pushed the issue to the forefront of the presidential debate, urging the party\u2019s candidates to commit to eliminating the rule which looms as an obstacle to their ambitious policy proposals. In 2013, Reid deployed the so-called \u201cnuclear option\u201d and eliminated the filibuster for nominations to executive branch positions and lower-court judgeships in response to Republican obstruction of Barack Obama\u2019s appointees. In 2017, McConnell further limited the minority\u2019s power when he removed the filibuster for Supreme court nominees to undermine a Democratic blockade. The demise of the filibuster is a reflection of the course, partisan nature of this political moment. Obama\u2019s election inspired a conservative uprising against his presidency, with McConnell insisting then that the \u201csingle most important thing\u201d for Congressional Republicans was to ensure that he was a \u201cone-term\u201d president. Eight years later, Trump\u2019s victory has energized grassroots activists and liberals determined to see him removed from office. Ezra Levin, a co-founder of the progressive group Indivisible, which is pushing Democrats to adopt such reforms, said the op-ed was a sign McConnell is starting to fear the tactic. The economy is booming. There\u2019s no risk of a recession. Everything is FINE. FINE! Also from the White House: Trump is interested in a payroll tax cut to encourage economic growth in the event of a slowdown. Somewhere in between, Trump continues to insist that the \u201conly problem\u201d with the US economy is the Federal Reserve. For months, Trump has attacked Fed Chairman Jerome Powell \u2013 a man he picked to run the US central bank. Ahead of a speech by Powell in Jackson Hole on Friday, Trump compared the Fed chairman to a golfer who was unable to putt and said he had let the country down. On Thursday, he returned to the subject, though he has so far avoided attacked Powell directly. Bernie Sanders on Thursday proposed the most ambitious plan yet to avert \u201cclimate catastrophe\u201d ahead of a visit to Paradise, the California town destroyed by a wildfire last year. The plan calls for a 10-year, $16.3tn national mobilization and aims to eliminate US carbon emissions by 2050, a target laid out by scientists with the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Sanders says the sprawling proposal, which he compares to Franklin Delano Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal economic programs, would create millions of jobs and rally the world\u2019s leaders to join forces in the fight against climate change. The plan, he says, would be paid for by \u201cmaking he fossil fuel industry pay for their pollution, through litigation, fees, and taxes, and eliminating federal fossil fuel subsidies.\u201d Sanders\u2019 Green New Deal would also: Aim reach 100% renewable power for both electricity and transportation, the top two contributors to climate change in the US, by 2030 Complete decarbonization by 2050 Expand public ownership of power companies and make electricity \u201cvirtually free\u201d by 2035 A promises to \u201cend unemployment\u201d by creating 20m new jobs Declare climate change a national emergency Invest a $200bn into the Green Climate Fund for countries to slash pollution. Donald Trump\u2019s desire to buy Greenland escalated into an international confrontation this week after he abruptly canceled a trip to Denmark, claiming the country\u2019s prime minister had been \u201cnasty\u201d to him when she called the idea \u201cabsurd\u201d. Now a new backstory is emerging that might explain what piqued the president\u2019s interest in purchasing the icy island. Arkansas senator Tom Cotton said he spoke to the president about buying Greenland months ago and even raised it in a meeting with the Danish ambassador, according to Talk Business &amp; Politics, which hosted an event in Little Rock, where Cotton made his comments. \u201cObviously, the right decision for this country,\u201d Cotton told the group\u2019s CEO when asked about the spat. \u201cYou\u2019re joking, but I can reveal to you that several months ago, I met with the Danish ambassador and I proposed that they sell Greenland to us.\u201d \u201cI told the president you should buy it as well,\u201d Cotton continued, adding later that Trump \u201cheard that from me and from some other people as well.\u201d Cotton, a staunch conservative and a close ally of Trump, said touted such a deal as strategic on the part of the US. Greenland, an autonomous region owned by Denmark, possesses \u201cuntold\u201d economic potential and would be \u201cvital to our national security.\u201d \u201cAnyone who can\u2019t see that is blinded by Trump derangement,\u201d he said. Read a write up of the conversation here. And more on the row between Trump and Denmark. Bet you didn\u2019t see that one coming, did you? Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the day\u2019s political news. Lauren Gambino here, manning the blog for the day from our nation\u2019s capital. This morning begins with a shakeup to the 2020 race. Overnight, Jay Inslee, the Democratic governor of Washington who made climate change the focus of his presidential campaign, has dropped out of the race after failing to qualify for the third primary debate. The Associated Press is reporting Inslee is planning to seek a third term as governor. Joe Walsh, the one-term Illinois congressman and conservative radio show host, says he\u2019s \u201cstrongly, strongly considering\u201d mounting a primary bid against Trump. \u201cThe only way you primary Donald Trump and beat him is to expose him for the con man he is,\u201d Walsh said on CNN\u2019s New Day on Thursday. \u201cAnd if I did it ... that\u2019s what I\u2019d do \u2013 I\u2019d punch him every single day.\u201d Trump already faces a primary challenge, former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld, but his campaign has yet to generate enough enthusiasm to conceivably test the president\u2019s stranglehold on the Republican party. Meanwhile, John Hickenlooper, the former Colorado governor who suspended his presidential campaign last month, has announced that he will run for the Senate. Hickenlooper joins a congested primary despite saying things like: \u201cI\u2019m not cut out to be a senator.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve always said Washington was a lousy place for a guy like me who wants to get things done \u2013 but this is no time to walk away from the table,\u201d Hickenlooper said in a video announcing his run for Senate to take on Republican incumbent Cory Gardner. What we\u2019re watching for today: Trump has a relatively light public schedule, aside from his daily intelligence briefing. At 4.30 pm, he is scheduled to present the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Celtics legend Bob Cousy, who was known for his public stance against racism and segregation in the 1950s.",

Frederiksen says dispute will not harm \u2018good relationship\u2019 with US The Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, has said she was surprised and disappointed by Donald Trump\u2019s decision to cancel his visit to Copenhagen, after she dismissed his proposal to buy Greenland as \u201cabsurd\u201d. Other Danes and Greenlanders echoed the sentiment, with one former minister calling the US president a \u201cnarcissistic fool\u201d. Trump said he scotched the trip as he found the Danish leader\u2019s remarks \u201cnasty\u201d, but she insisted her country\u2019s \u201cgood relationship\u201d with the US would be unaffected. Putin\u2019s influence? Richard Wolffe says Trump\u2019s interest in Greenland might originate with Russia, which covets the arctic island\u2019s unknown quantities of oil, gas and minerals. \u2018Chosen One\u2019. On Wednesday, the president doubled down on an antisemitic trope, saying Jewish Americans who voted for Democrats were \u201cdisloyal to Israel\u201d. He also described himself as \u201cthe Chosen One\u201d to fight a trade war with China. US to remove limits on length of migrant child detention The Trump administration has announced plans to eliminate a federal court agreement putting time limits on child detention, allowing the government to hold migrant children with their parents indefinitely. The longstanding Flores agreement says the government must release children as quickly as possible, generally after 20 days. But the administration\u2019s new rule, to be published on Friday, would scrap the time limit and give officials more power to determine the standards of care for families in custody. Birthright citizenship. Trump said on Wednesday that his administration was looking at ending birthright citizenship, saying: \u201cYou walk over the border, have a baby \u2013 congratulations, the baby is now a US citizen ... It\u2019s frankly ridiculous.\u201d Abortion \u2018gag rule\u2019 leaves poor women with \u2018nowhere to go\u2019 Planned Parenthood, the nation\u2019s largest reproductive health provider, withdrew this week from Title X \u2013 the federal program which distributes grants to clinics \u2013 over the Trump administration\u2019s new \u201cgag rule\u201d banning clinics from referring patients for abortions. That leaves low-income patients in states such as Utah \u2013 where Planned Parenthood is the sole Title X provider \u2013 with \u201cnowhere to go,\u201d as one Planned Parenthood executives tells Miranda Bryant. The moral choice? Planned Parenthood was right to refuse federal funding, says Moira Donegan. The Trump administration had put the organisation in an untenable position. Anti-abortion voters. A survey shows what really motivates anti-abortionists, argues Jill Filipovic: hostility to gender equality and a desire to control women. Democrats to vote on climate debate as Inslee drops out Jay Inslee, the Washington state governor who sought the Democratic presidential nomination on a platform devoted to tackling the climate crisis, has dropped out of the 2020 race saying it was clear he could not win. Yet his core issue may yet have its day, with the Democratic National Committee due to vote on Thursday as to whether the party\u2019s remaining 2020 candidates ought to take part in an entirely climate-focused televised debate. Mileage standards. Automakers are pushing back against the Trump administration\u2019s loosening environmental rules because they want to be seen as on the right side of the climate crisis \u2013 and to avoid drawn-out court battles they would ultimately lose, a former senior Obama official has said. Crib sheet The US federal deficit is set to reach $1tn in 2020, according to figures released by the Congressional Budget Office. On current projections, the national debt will hit 95% of GDP within 10 years, its highest level since just after the second world war. Brazil\u2019s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, has claimed without evidence that environmental groups are responsible for a series of fires in the Amazon rainforest, suggesting the blazes were set in order to embarrass his government. Officials in southern California have reopened an investigation into a group of Orange County high school students seen giving Nazi salutes on video, following the emergence of further videos showing students at the school engaged in hate speech. Microplastics are increasingly found in drinking water, but there is as yet no evidence that such contamination poses a health risk to humans, a new WHO assessment has concluded.

In the fight against plastic pollution, Tesco has said it will \u201creserve the right not to list\u201d products with too much non-recyclable packaging from 2020 onwards. \u201cBut to close the loop on packaging, more needs to be done,\u201d writes Dave Lewis, the Tesco CEO, in the Guardian today. \u201cWe need a standardised national collection and a truly complete and national recycling infrastructure.\u201d Separately the World Health Organization has published its assessment that based on current science microplastics in drinking water pose no known health risk to humans \u2013 but adds that further research is needed. * * * Pill plethora risk to elderly \u2013 About 7 million elderly people in the UK are at risk of life-threatening harm from medications that could clash with each other or cause dangerous side-effects, Age UK has warned. Care home residents take an average of at least eight medicines, with a one in 10 risk of a mistake; while one in five prescriptions for elderly people living at home are incorrect. They should have regular reviews of their drugs, says Age UK. Meanwhile even a small increase in light activity by older adults can reduce their risk of an early death, according to a review of eight studies covering thousands of participants wearing activity trackers. The group with the highest levels of light physical activity \u2013 achieving about 380 minutes a day \u2013 had a 62% lower risk of death than the group that did the least, according to findings published in the British Medical Journal. * * * What happened to Robert Maxwell? \u2013 Almost 30 years before Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s demise, Ghislaine Maxwell was caught up in another shocking and scandal-ridden mystery when her father drowned in the night after falling from his \u00a315m yacht off the Canary Islands. Even now there is talk of suicide, or murder \u2013 perhaps by Mossad, the Israeli intelligence service. Caroline Davies reviews the life of flamboyant press baron and shyster Robert Maxwell, and the theories surrounding his death. * * * Sticky situation \u2013 Disney/Marvel and Sony have split over their arrangement for Spider-Man to appear in the Avengers movies and vice-versa. For those who don\u2019t know their SUMC from their MCU: Sony owns the film rights to Spider-Man, but a deal was struck for the character (played by Tom Holland) to appear in films of the Disney-run Marvel Cinematic Universe. Now that the relationship between the studios has broken down, and with Spider-Man\u2019s character woven in alongside Tony Stark, Captain America and the Avengers, have we seen the last of the Iron Spider? Lunchtime read: Rise and fall of Brand Trudeau Thanks to his clever use of social media, Canada\u2019s Justin Trudeau was dubbed the first prime minister of the Instagram age. He cultivated an impression that he both serves the masses and is adored by them. But after four years in power, cracks in his image have started to show. Canada\u2019s ethics watchdog recently found he broke the country\u2019s conflict of interest law to try to get a giant engineering and construction firm out of a corruption trial. Far from progressive, transparent government, the scandal suggests that, like previous Canadian governments, Trudeau\u2019s administration remains in thrall to the \u201cLaurentian consensus\u201d \u2013 the web of political, business and intellectual elites in Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal whose name is a nod to eastern Canada\u2019s St Lawrence river. Ahead of a federal election in October, Trudeau\u2019s approval ratings have plunged from a high of 65% in 2016 to about 32% in July. \u201cBrand Trudeau was squeaky clean and fresh and new and a different kind of politics,\u201d says Shachi Kurl, a pollster from the Angus Reid Institute. \u201cAnd it\u2019s turned out that Brand Trudeau is: \u2018Welcome to the new politics, just like the old politics.\u2019\u201d Sport Joe Root believes England are ready to pounce on the absence of Steve Smith and heap more pressure on Australia by using Jofra Archer when the third Ashes Test gets under way at Headingley today. Ben Te\u2019o has effectively brought an end to his England rugby career by signing for Toulon on a short-term contract, having been left out of Eddie Jones\u2019s World Cup squad. Manu Tuilagi has revealed how he could have avoided more than a year of his injury layoff if he had come clean regarding his initial groin problem. World Rugby has rebranded its men\u2019s and women\u2019s World Cups in an effort to achieve gender neutrality in the sport. And Major League Baseball has warned its players about the \u201cvery real risk\u201d of over-the-counter sexual-enhancement pills after at least two players attributed their positive drug tests to substances found in the unregulated products. Business A serious question is hanging over the HS2 rail link project after the government launched a review into the \u00a355bn scheme with a longstanding critic on the panel. An even more mind-boggling number from the US where federal deficit will top $1tn next year, according to a congressional report. And that\u2019s before Donald Trump plans any more tax cuts or giveaways ahead of the 2020 election. On the markets, the FTSE100 is seen starting the day off about 0.1%. The pound is trundling along at $1.212 and \u20ac1.093. The papers Angela Merkel\u2019s \u201c30 days\u201d deadline for Boris Johnson to produce a workable alternative to the Irish backstop is all over the front pages, with some creative interpretations. The Mail sees the declaration as a \u201cBrexit boost for Boris\u201d and enthuses \u201cJa, we can! \u2026 Merkel says backstop CAN be ditched\u201d. The Express thinks Johnson has won a \u201cmajor concession\u201d and has the PM welcoming Merkel\u2019s \u201cblistering deadline\u201d. The Mirror, though, says in its intro that Merkel has \u201ccalled Boris Johnson\u2019s bluff\u201d and straplines the story as a \u201cBrexit ultimatum\u201d to the PM (why didn\u2019t the Mirror put \u201cChancellor meets chancer\u201d in its headline? Must try harder). The Guardian, the Telegraph, the i and the Times are all straitlaced: think various constructions involving 30 days, Brexit, deal, backstop, Johnson, Germany, Merkel \u2026 Over at the FT they\u2019re on about how lower borrowing costs have prompted calls for spending on public projects to rev up the economy, while a pic slot goes to the chancellor and the prime minister.

          "body": "<p>On the last night of March 2012, Justin Trudeau climbed into a boxing ring in downtown Ottawa, the Canadian capital, intent on rescuing his public image. He was clad in a lustrous red robe, the colour of the Liberal party, for which he was then a junior member of parliament. In the opposite corner, wearing Tory blue, was a young aboriginal leader and Conservative senator named Patrick Brazeau, who is a former navy reservist and a second-degree black belt in karate. Bookies had given the lanky Trudeau, a former high school teacher, three-to-one odds against.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2017/jul/28/justin-trudeau-and-senator-patrick-brazeau-face-off-in-2012-boxing-match-video\" title=\"\">televised match</a> was ostensibly a fundraiser for cancer research, but in Ottawa it became a sensation \u2013 a display of partisan pageantry rarely seen in the staid world of Canadian politics, where \u201cbland works\u201d had been the watchword of one long-serving provincial premier. The fight\u2019s symbolism was lost on no one: in recent years, the Conservatives had battered the Liberals, turning a narrow lead in the 2006 election into a majority government by 2011. The Liberal party, which had governed Canada for much of the 20th century, had been reduced to a historically low number of seats.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2019/sep/09/justin-trudeau-the-rise-and-fall-of-a-political-brand-podcast\">Justin Trudeau: the rise and fall of a political brand \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trudeau ranked among the best hopes for resuscitating the Liberals and leading them back into power. But his political career, which began in earnest four years earlier, had been dogged by criticisms that he lacked substance and was riding on the coattails of his father, Pierre Trudeau, one of Canada\u2019s longest-serving prime ministers. Barbra Streisand, a former lover of Pierre\u2019s, once described him as a blend of \u201cMarlon Brando and Napoleon\u201d. In contrast, one critic had memorably dubbed Justin \u201cthe Paris Hilton of Canadian politics\u201d. A triumphant bout in the ring could help erode this perception, Trudeau figured. \u201cNever underestimate the power of symbols in today\u2019s world,\u201d he told a documentary film <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/143909623\" title=\"\">crew chronicling the fight</a>.</p> <p>Within seconds of the opening bell, Brazeau pinned Trudeau against the ropes with an onslaught of heavy jabs. But the Conservative senator soon exhausted himself. Early in the second round, Trudeau seized on the opening, raining down blows on Brazeau. Less than a minute into the third round, as the Liberal MP continued to pummel his opponent, the referee halted the fight and declared Trudeau the winner.</p> <p>That victory was one of the first major triumphs in a branding campaign that helped to transform Trudeau from a politician widely derided as a lightweight into a global political superstar. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t random,\u201d Trudeau told Rolling Stone in 2017, referring to the boxing match. \u201cI wanted someone who would be a good foil, and we stumbled upon the scrappy, tough-guy senator from an Indigenous community \u2026 I saw it as the right kind of narrative, the right story to tell.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2017/jul/28/justin-trudeau-and-senator-patrick-brazeau-face-off-in-2012-boxing-match-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/7v2n9\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"3722175\"            data-video-name=\"Justin Trudeau and Senator Patrick Brazeau face off in 2012 boxing match  \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"LCN Canada\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-597a7d17e4b0cc197665c141\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=12331576&amp;format=video/mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=12331576&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=12331576&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2017/jul/28/justin-trudeau-and-senator-patrick-brazeau-face-off-in-2012-boxing-match-video\">Justin Trudeau and Senator Patrick Brazeau face off in 2012 boxing match</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>In the weeks after the fight, the Canadian media, which had previously portrayed the Liberal MP as a \u201creed-thin, pedigreed Dauphin\u201d, began lauding Trudeau as a public figure of \u201ctoughness, strength, honour and courage\u201d, noted Elise Maiolino, then a PhD candidate in sociology at the University of Toronto, after analysing hundreds of news articles. That change in perception electrified Trudeau\u2019s career, helping to set him on a path to become leader of the Liberal party the following year. Two years after that, in 2015, the Liberals made an unprecedented leap from third-party status to a majority government \u2013 and Trudeau became, like his father before him, the prime minister of Canada.</p> <p>The sort of potent spectacle that characterised his fight with Brazeau was, until recently, a hallmark of Trudeau\u2019s tenure as prime minister. Like Barack Obama, Trudeau seemed to understand better than other politicians how to adapt the old ideas of political marketeering to the new realities of social media. He was a master of the viral video clip or poignant photo that seemed to express the worthiness of his government and the virtue of his politics. He became, as a flurry of academic research has put it, the first prime minister of the Instagram age. \u201cI think he\u2019s probably the best national leader since Ronald Reagan at projecting a certain image,\u201d says Warren Kinsella, a former Liberal strategist.</p> <p>Trudeau has championed a vision of Canada as a nation friendly to allies, open to immigrants and just to its people. According to this image, Canada is a paragon of progressivism in an era marked by strains of authoritarian populism \u2013 as if crossing the border that separates Canada from Donald Trump\u2019s US means travelling through a political looking-glass. And yet, Trudeau was never exactly anti-populist: he cultivated an impression that he both serves the masses and is adored by them.</p> <p>Ironically, but perhaps inevitably, Trudeau\u2019s efforts to depict himself in this way have now helped to set the stage for his potential unmaking. Some of the policies enacted by Trudeau\u2019s government have made his political identity seem hollow, even disingenuous. Compounding this has been the ongoing fallout from the most significant controversy of his tenure: Canada\u2019s ethics watchdog recently found that Trudeau broke the country\u2019s conflict of interest law in the hopes of allowing a giant engineering and construction firm to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/14/trudeau-broke-ethics-law-in-snc-lavalin-case-watchdog-rules\" title=\"\">avoid a corruption trial</a>. The company is facing charges in connection with millions of dollars in bribes allegedly paid to officials in Libya, including members of the Gaddafi regime, between 2001 and 2011.</p> <p>Far from the progressive, transparent government that Trudeau sold to Canadians and the global media, the scandal suggests that, like previous Canadian governments, Trudeau\u2019s administration remains in thrall to the \u201cLaurentian consensus\u201d \u2013 the web of political, business and intellectual elites in Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal whose collective name is a nod to eastern Canada\u2019s mighty St Lawrence river. Ahead of a federal election in October, Trudeau\u2019s approval ratings have plunged from a high of 65% in 2016 to about 32% in July, leaving him vulnerable to becoming the first Canadian prime minister since the 1930s to lose a bid for re-election after winning only one majority mandate.</p> <p>\u201cBrand Trudeau was squeaky clean and fresh and new and a different kind of politics,\u201d says Shachi Kurl, a pollster from the Angus Reid Institute. \u201cAnd it\u2019s turned out that Brand Trudeau is: \u2018Welcome to the new politics, just like the old politics.\u2019\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In an age of constant and intimate exposure to celebrities, it may seem unsurprising that the head of government of a country containing less than half of 1% of the world\u2019s population should be so familiar. But how many other Canadian prime ministers have been profiled in the New York Times Magazine, Vogue and Rolling Stone? How many other Canadian prime ministers can most non-Canadians even name, let alone call to mind an image of? </p> <p>One of the extraordinary things about Trudeau is that he is famous in part because he is Canadian \u2013 a remarkably rare kind of fame. Most Canadians who are famous outside of the country have been processed through Hollywood or the US-dominated recording industry. Part of Trudeau\u2019s appeal within Canada, then, is that he assuaged a dual sense of cultural insecurity and superiority, especially with regard to the country\u2019s belligerent southern neighbour. (The majority of Canadians see Trudeau\u2019s fame as a net benefit to the country, according to the Angus Reid Institute.) On the global stage he presented a sort of ideal form \u2013 likable, handsome, virtuous \u2013 in which the country could see its best self.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Get the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-long-read\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Long Read email\u201d data-form-description=\u201cGet the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\u201d scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Trudeau\u2019s distinctly Canadian appeal goes even deeper. The prime minister represents a potent idea of Canada and what it means to the world. This idea is perhaps best summed up by a campaign motto of Trudeau\u2019s father, from the late 1960s: \u201cThe just society.\u201d The idea was sold to Canadians as encompassing the protection of civil rights, economic opportunity for all, scientific remedies to environmental problems, greater autonomy for Indigenous people in Canada, and a country in which the language rights of both French and English were enshrined.</p> <p>A great deal of Trudeau\u2019s political cachet within Canada has been inherited from his father. Pierre is a towering figure in Canadian history, who liberalised laws on abortion and homosexuality, entrenched a charter of universal rights and instituted official bilingualism. The Canadian mass media guru Marshall McLuhan, a friendly adviser to Pierre throughout the 15 years he was prime minister, believed that Canada had no fixed identity, giving Pierre an opportunity to act as its \u201cunifying image\u201d. Canada could, in a sense, become what Pierre made it. Even if few Canadians subscribe to McLuhan\u2019s view, it captures something central to how Pierre framed his own tenure as prime minister.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"654b710dfd7d73aba180ca50b070be9b1a551a63\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/654b710dfd7d73aba180ca50b070be9b1a551a63/0_0_2892_2278/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Queen with Canadian prime minister Pierre Trudeau, father of Justin, in London in 1977.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"788\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Queen with Canadian prime minister Pierre Trudeau, father of Justin, in London in 1977.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Goode/Toronto Star via Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The craze for Justin Trudeau during the first years of his prime ministership echoed the \u201cTrudeaumania\u201d of his father\u2019s ascent to power. Pierre, too, captured attention around the world by staging moments of spectacle \u2013 whether it was sliding down a bannister during his 1968 campaign for Liberal leader or pirouetting behind the Queen at Buckingham Palace in 1977. Pierre was \u201cpackaged and presented as a debonair anti-politician who drove sports cars and spent time with pretty women\u201d, writes Alex Marland, a scholar of Canadian political branding at Memorial University. \u201cTo cultivate an image of a pop culture phenomenon\u201d during Canada\u2019s 1968 federal election, he adds, \u201cLiberal strategists recruited young Liberal women to behave as obsessed fanatics\u201d when Pierre was in the presence of reporters.</p> <p>Justin\u2019s attempts to recreate Trudeaumania have involved wading through crowds to allow fans to snap selfies with him \u2013 while his official photographer <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B03zcs7AqZL/\" title=\"\">captures the moment</a> at a slight distance. The results, posted on Instagram, feel like a record of spontaneous adulation, but are actually tightly controlled. As Marland puts it, Trudeau is executing a \u201csimilar playbook\u201d to his father\u2019s, but \u201cin different technological terrain\u201d.</p> <p>Outside the country, Trudeau has played to the world\u2019s eagerness to imagine Canada as a northern utopia untouched by the forces of nationalism and xenophobia. Within the country, however, there are many who think that Liberal Canada has never been the progressive place that Pierre and Justin tried to make it seem. The question now is whether voters believe his son has delivered more than just a good narrative.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>When a political brand becomes as powerful as Trudeau\u2019s has, it is tempting to read a person\u2019s entire biography as a branding exercise. Things the politician did in their life before politics become plot points in a success story devised by a canny political operator. Ian Capstick, a political commentator who has worked for the Liberals as well as their rivals to the left, the New Democratic party, believes that Trudeau and his longtime friend and adviser Gerald Butts \u201chave been carefully calculating every single entree of Mr Trudeau into Canadian public life for the past 30 years\u201d. He adds: \u201cThere is not a single action that he took publicly that wasn\u2019t considered, reconsidered and put out there in an attempt to eventually build the base that he would require to be prime minister.\u201d</p> <p>Even if this view is a little too cynical, there is no doubt that living his entire life in the public eye has endowed Trudeau with an instinctive, if not infallible, sense of political optics. The beginning of his rise to power has usually been dated to 3 October 2000, when the 28-year-old delivered a dramatic televised eulogy at his father\u2019s state funeral, closing with the words \u201cJe t\u2019aime, papa\u201d, before resting his head on his father\u2019s flag-draped coffin, his tears falling freely. Switchboards at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation lit up with more than 1,000 requests to replay the tribute.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9122d0f69b7371c317760dd106fef263ce918fee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9122d0f69b7371c317760dd106fef263ce918fee/0_0_2048_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Justin Trudeau (third from right) and other family members at his father Pierre Trudeau\u2019s state funeral in Montreal in 2000.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"703\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Justin Trudeau and other family members at his father Pierre Trudeau\u2019s state funeral in Montreal in 2000.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shaun Best/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Immediately, there was talk of the younger Trudeau entering politics, but many observers felt he lacked gravitas. He had spent his mid-20s drifting between stints as a bar bouncer and snowboard instructor before becoming a schoolteacher. He even admitted, or pretended, to an ignorance of current affairs. \u201cI don\u2019t read the newspapers, I don\u2019t watch the news,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/justin-trudeau-like-his-peers-seeks-politics-without-politics/article1337650/\" title=\"\">he wrote</a> in the Globe and Mail the year after his father\u2019s death. \u201cI figure, if something important happens, someone will tell me.\u201d</p> <p>Trudeau finally entered politics in 2007, when he began running for parliament in the riding of Papineau, a multicultural district in Montreal, which was represented at the time by a Quebec-nationalist party. During the election in 2008, he grasped something in miniature that Obama demonstrated on a larger scale that same year: that a political brand is not sufficient in and of itself \u2013 you also need a political operation. (Trump, who may not have had much of a grassroots campaign by comparison, is proof of how far such operations have moved to social media.) Trudeau won after mounting a year-long effort to knock on doors and shake hands in the district.</p> <p>It was an impressive start, but Trudeau\u2019s subsequent four years as an MP were generally seen as insipid. It wasn\u2019t until his rout of the Conservative senator Brazeau in the boxing match in 2012 that the larger political tide began to turn for him. Three years later, Trudeau\u2019s fight to become prime minister made his father\u2019s brand his own.</p> <p>In the 2015 general election, Trudeau married the values of the just society with the electoral approach pioneered by Obama, building the infrastructure for a grassroots effort while mounting an aggressive social media campaign. But Trudeau relied more heavily than Obama could on images. \u201cObama\u2019s use of social media was, for lack of a better term, pre-visual,\u201d says Tamara Small, a political science professor at Ontario\u2019s University of Guelph.</p> <p>The election pitted Trudeau against Stephen Harper, a dour Conservative who had governed Canada for nearly a decade. Few expected much of Trudeau, the neophyte leader of Canada\u2019s third-ranked party. \u201cI think that if he comes on stage with his pants on, he will probably exceed expectations,\u201d a Conservative spokesperson told reporters before the first debate. In one famous attack advert, Conservatives labelled Trudeau as \u201cjust not ready\u201d, while mockingly conceding that he has \u201cnice hair, though\u201d.</p> <p>But many Canadians already felt a deep connection to Trudeau. \u201cHe has grown up in the public eye. He was literally born while his father was prime minister,\u201d Marland told me. \u201cHe was a celebrity before he even became prime minister.\u201d This made Trudeau seem regal, yet familiar \u2013 a brand you knew and could trust. Trudeau\u2019s team did everything they could to encourage this intimate connection with their candidate. \u201cIt was probably Canada\u2019s first celebrity politics federal election,\u201d says Huguette Young, a veteran Ottawa journalist and author of Justin Trudeau: The Natural Heir. \u201cThey had Dinner with Justin, just like Dinner with Obama, and contests and you could win a date with Justin. He was almost commodified as a product.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4719792fa0470a4f130758ef780cf66a0ca579dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4719792fa0470a4f130758ef780cf66a0ca579dd/0_0_3500_2314/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Justin Trudeau at an election rally in Ottawa in 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"661\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trudeau at an election rally in Ottawa in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick Doyle/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cTrudeau really built his brand in order to counter the brand of Harper,\u201d says Vincent Raynauld, a professor at Boston\u2019s Emerson College who studies Canadian politics. In contrast to his opponent, who was seen as icy and remote, Trudeau promised a return to \u201csunny ways\u201d \u2013 the motto of a much-admired prime minister from the turn of the 20th century. While Harper mooted banning the niqab at Canadian citizenship ceremonies and launching a hotline to ferret out what his party called \u201cbarbaric cultural practices\u201d, Trudeau made a passionate defence of multiculturalism and immigration.</p> <p>These were only two of the areas in which Trudeau promised to \u201cdo politics differently\u201d. In a country where women make up just 26% of MPs, he promised to usher in a new age of gender equality \u2013 beginning by naming a cabinet comprised of as many women as men. In what would have constituted a direct challenge to his own party\u2019s dominance, Trudeau pledged to make space for smaller political parties by reforming Canada\u2019s first-past-the-post electoral system. He vowed to reset the country\u2019s relationship with its disproportionately disadvantaged Indigenous peoples. All in all, the Liberal manifesto made 353 specific policy promises.</p> <p>After almost a decade of Harper, there was a widespread desire for change. Presented with two very different images of Canada\u2019s future, voters responded with a clear answer. On 19 October 2015, the Liberal party swept back to power by picking up 148 seats on top of the 36 they already held in Canada\u2019s 338-member parliament. It was the largest increase in seats in Canadian history.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>As Trudeau took office, his focus on optics was on full display. The often sedate swearing-in of a new government was thrown open to the public and turned into a highly stage-managed, live-streamed event. Trudeau was due to arrive by coach at the prime minister\u2019s official residence, 24 Sussex Drive, where he spent his childhood. (The house has been under renovation since Trudeau took office, and he and his family have been living in a 22-room guest house nearby.) To avoid any inelegant photos or video \u2013 \u201cGetting off a bus is such an ugly shot,\u201d Trudeau told his communications director that morning, in comments captured by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation \u2013 Trudeau\u2019s team misled the media about where they should meet the new prime minister, ensuring that the first images the press got were of him strolling from 24 Sussex to the governor general\u2019s official residence, Rideau Hall, where the ceremony would take place. At another point that morning, Trudeau and his team were preparing to respond to the question of why he was appointing a gender-balanced cabinet. \u201cI think just calling people\u2019s attention to the year is all you really need to say,\u201d Gerald Butts, Trudeau\u2019s right-hand man, told him. The advice yielded one of Trudeau\u2019s most internationally famous lines: \u201cBecause it\u2019s 2015.\u201d</p> <p>Around the same time, Trudeau\u2019s team was courting international attention, prioritising interviews with the New York Times and a sultry photoshoot for Vogue with his wife, Sophie, over interviews with Canadian media. \u201cThat was very, very deliberate,\u201d said Susan Delacourt, a journalist at the Toronto Star. \u201cThere was a sense that Canadians would like that.\u201d Many Canadians initially did, interpreting the attention as a sign of Trudeau\u2019s place among progressive world leaders at a time when Obama was still president and Hillary Clinton seemed poised to succeed him, Delacourt added.</p> <p>Trudeau moved his official photographer into an office two doors down from his own. A mix of intimate and public photo ops \u2013 of the prime minister cuddling with pandas, greeting Syrian refugees as they landed on Canadian soil, throwing punches in a Brooklyn boxing gym \u2013 transformed Trudeau from a politician into a series of memes. During his first year in power, barely a week went by without some sort of viral moment from the prime minister that found its way into people\u2019s daily lives as they scrolled through Snapchat on the bus or perused Instagram in bed. As Trudeau content appeared on social media shorn of context, it created new realities: a rehearsed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/life-and-physics/2016/apr/16/justin-trudeau-and-quantum-computers\" title=\"\">explanation</a> of quantum computing became a show of Trudeau\u2019s intellectual prowess; an innocuous cough on a visit to Washington DC became an example of Trudeau trolling the president.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e43110b31f21ac73228ad289594ca7b03d77a527\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e43110b31f21ac73228ad289594ca7b03d77a527/0_234_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Justin Trudeau posing with high school students while out jogging in Vancouver 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trudeau posing with high school students while out jogging in Vancouver 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters/Instagram</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A vital part of Trudeau\u2019s brand was the contrast between him and the far-right politicians gaining ground around the world. In the US, Trump was on a journey that in some ways echoed Trudeau\u2019s, parlaying his celebrity status into political power. When it came to optics, though, \u201cTrump was a gift\u201d for Trudeau, says Philippe Garneau, a corporate branding executive whose brother Marc ran against Trudeau for the Liberal leadership and is a minister in Trudeau\u2019s cabinet. \u201cI remember being worried. I said: \u2018How can we put a man who has a degree in teaching and [who taught] drama, sit him down with Angela Merkel and across from Putin?\u2019 And in walks Potus and upsets the whole apple cart,\u201d Garneau went on. \u201cSo Trudeau got lucky. He was never shown to be the youngest, newest, greenest member at the table, but rather some sort of version of youthful exuberance, enthusiasm, optimism and a lack of cynicism.\u201d</p> <p>When Trump pushed through his ban on travellers from a number of Muslim-majority countries, Trudeau tweeted that Canada would welcome those fleeing persecution, regardless of their faith. As accusations of sexual misconduct piled up against Trump, Trudeau proclaimed his own feminism in the pages of Marie Claire. As Trump vowed to put America first, Trudeau said Canada was \u201cback\u201d as a global player.</p> <p>Trudeau\u2019s contrast with Trump was successfully memefied when the two leaders met in February 2017. Trump\u2019s opening salvo with other world leaders had been an uncomfortably long, domineering handshake. Days earlier, Shinz\u014d Abe, Japan\u2019s prime minister, had been left reeling after a grip that dragged on for 19 seconds. Trudeau agonised for weeks about finding a technique that could show he was capable of holding his own, but which wouldn\u2019t antagonise the man now at the helm of Canada\u2019s largest trading partner.</p> <p>Eventually, he and his team decided on a combination handshake and shoulder grab. According to Politico, Trudeau and his senior aides spent part of their flight to Washington DC practising it. The rehearsal paid off: Trudeau was hailed around the world for the handshake <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2017/feb/14/donald-trumps-strange-handshake-style-and-how-justin-trudeau-beat-it-video-explainer\" title=\"\">he unleashed</a> on Trump. Viral videos of the seconds-long power struggle overshadowed a visit in which Trudeau stood by silently \u2013 later telling reporters that it was not his place to lecture another country \u2013 as Trump unapologetically defended his controversial travel ban.</p> <p>It was part of a pattern in which Trudeau and his team produced globally viral images that starved important political issues of oxygen. In 2017, at the height of an opioid epidemic that had claimed a record number of overdose victims in Vancouver, Trudeau\u2019s official photographer took an opportunistic photo of the prime minister running past a crowd of high schoolers on their prom night. Criticisms that the Trudeau government had not done enough to address the opioid crisis were buried by viral photos of the prime minister in running shorts and a T-shirt surrounded by students in suits and floor-length gowns. In politics, however, reality has a way of catching up with you. Eventually, the scandal, instead of the photo op, is what goes viral.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In retrospect, it seems predictable that a brand so well-devised, so symbolic and emotive, would encourage idealisations that in reality no politician could match. In 2018, some three years after Trudeau took power, cracks began showing in Trudeau\u2019s glossy veneer. In February, Trudeau and his family made an eight-day visit to India that was described to me by his former foreign policy adviser, Roland Paris, as perhaps \u201cthe worst trip that a Canadian prime minister has ever taken abroad\u201d. Although Trudeau sat down with his Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi, and attended a handful of other bilateral meetings, what gained traction on social media were photos of the prime minister flouncing around in traditional Indian outfits. The result was a trip that seemed heavy on Bhangra moves but light on official business.</p> <p>\u201cIndia crystallised a lot of misgivings that liberals had that he was perhaps not as mature as we would like, he was not as prime ministerial as we would like, he was a little gimmicky and not taking it seriously with the world\u2019s largest democracy,\u201d Warren Kinsella, the former Liberal strategist, told me. Months later, Trudeau\u2019s feminist credentials took a hit after an allegation resurfaced that he had groped a reporter at an event in 2000. While acknowledging that he did apologise at the time to the reporter after she confronted him, Trudeau <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/06/trudeau-i-apologised-at-once-to-reporter-behind-groping-claim-canada-2000-music-festival\" title=\"\">has said</a> he is confident that he did not act inappropriately. Criticism grew that Trudeau\u2019s government was merely tinkering around the edges of change, masking their political inaction with a steady diet of unexpected moments and big talk.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3cb7af74e118d5bb21473022ef5bbe8c3891b45e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3cb7af74e118d5bb21473022ef5bbe8c3891b45e/0_0_3937_2362/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trudeau with his wife and children in Amritsar, India in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trudeau with his wife and children in Amritsar, India in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Narinder Nanu/AFP/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve done check box, check box, check box,\u201d says Celina Caesar-Chavannes, an MP and former parliamentary secretary to the prime minister who resigned from the Liberal caucus after a dispute with Trudeau. \u201cBut how does it really transform the lives of people who don\u2019t have Trudeau\u2019s privilege, who don\u2019t have my privilege?\u201d Caesar-Chavannes argues that Trudeau\u2019s government has made small changes but consistently shies away from the bold, transformational work he promised in a campaign built around the slogan, \u201cReal Change\u201d. \u201cI think there were some decisions around our ability to be re-elected as opposed to doing politics differently,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Caesar-Chavannes gave me a number of examples of this sort of policymaking. Trudeau\u2019s government legalised marijuana but rebuffed a call to expunge the records of those convicted of simple possession, even though prosecutions had disproportionately targeted people with low-incomes and Canadians of colour. Trudeau appointed a gender-balanced cabinet, but refused to reform the country\u2019s electoral system, which would have paved the way for more female lawmakers. He promised a \u201ctotal renewal\u201d of Canada\u2019s relationship with Indigenous communities, but his government has done little to address the mould-ridden housing and lack of clean drinking water that has left many Indigenous communities living in \u201cHaiti at -40C\u201d, as a politician from the New Democratic party has put it. After vowing to prioritise the fight against climate change and criticising Saudi Arabia\u2019s treatment of human rights advocates, Trudeau\u2019s government bought a C$4.5bn (\u00a32.8bn) pipeline to better transport Alberta\u2019s landlocked bitumen to international markets and signed off on the sale of more than 900 armoured vehicles to Riyadh. And, after much of the international hype over its welcoming stance on refugees had died down, the government quietly introduced legislation this April that makes it harder for some migrants to seek asylum.</p> <p>Despite Trudeau selling himself as an open and transparent leader, several sources within the government described the centralisation of power in his office, with the prime minister\u2019s inner circle playing the role of his gatekeepers. This is typical of highly branded politicians \u2013 the pressure to keep the whole government on message encourages top-down control \u2013 but Trudeau may have taken it to an extreme. St\u00e9phane Dion served as Trudeau\u2019s foreign minister for 14 months, and during that time he didn\u2019t manage to land a single one-on-one meeting with the prime minister despite multiple requests, says Jocelyn Coulon, a former senior policy advisor to Dion. (Dion declined my request for a comment.)</p> <p>Trudeau\u2019s supporters point to the ways in which he has lived up to his promises. Since 2015, more than 44,000 Syrian refugees have been settled in Canada, compared with the 2,300 that Stephen Harper\u2019s government took in between 2013 and 2015. Trudeau\u2019s tenure so far has seen 278,000 children lifted out of poverty, a feat credited to the country\u2019s buoyant economy as well as a marquee child-benefit programme that provides direct funds to the country\u2019s poorest families. The government raised taxes on the top 1%, while cutting income tax for those in the middle bracket. And, while Canada is expected to fall short of its target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% below 2005 levels by 2030, Trudeau and his government have taken fledgling steps towards tackling climate change with legislation mandating a price on carbon in every province.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"108d1a6bf2b2098d66da3a40a8f331336e7ddd71\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/108d1a6bf2b2098d66da3a40a8f331336e7ddd71/0_327_6123_3674/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trudeau facing questions from journalists in Ottawa in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trudeau facing questions from journalists in Ottawa in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lars Hagberg/AFP/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Perhaps Trudeau\u2019s shortcomings wouldn\u2019t have dominated public discussion in Canada for much of this year if a single large scandal hadn\u2019t focused Canadians on the gap between Trudeau the brand and his actions while in government. In February, Trudeau was accused of trying to bully his justice minister, Jody Wilson-Raybould, into helping SNC-Lavalin, a Quebec-based engineering and construction company, avoid a corruption trial. Wilson-Raybould testified to a parliamentary committee earlier this year that Trudeau and his staff were worried that, if prosecuted, the company would move its head offices out of Montreal, potentially killing thousands of jobs and alienating voters in Quebec, home to a large number of strategically important parliamentary seats.</p> <p>Alongside the suggestion that Trudeau wanted to put his electoral success ahead of the integrity of the legal process, there was another layer to the scandal. Wilson-Raybould herself had once been a potent symbol of the Trudeau brand: she was the first Indigenous person and only the third woman to hold the post of justice minister. But the way she had been pressured by Trudeau and his team included \u201cundeniable elements of misogyny\u201d, she told the committee. Earlier this month, Canada\u2019s ethics commissioner concluded Trudeau had violated the country\u2019s ethics rules when he used his office to \u201ccircumvent, undermine and ultimately attempt to discredit\u201d Wilson-Raybould.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>When Canadians head to the polls in October, a central question will be whether Trudeau\u2019s image is so badly tarnished that the Liberal party\u2019s vision of Canada will seem less appealing, and less realistic, than the vision on offer by the parties to its right and left. As things stand, Trudeau\u2019s main opponent is the Conservative leader, Andrew Scheer. Scheer has vowed to roll back carbon taxes, opposed UN efforts to promote global cooperation on migration and wants to move Canada\u2019s embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. He has also appointed a former board member of Rebel Media, a far-right website that has been described as Breitbart North, as his campaign manager.</p> <p>In order to hang on to votes in the diverse suburbs that ring Toronto, which have proven decisive in recent elections, Liberals have been highlighting Scheer\u2019s divisiveness on issues of race and immigration. Trudeau has also drawn attention to the Conservative party\u2019s poor record on the climate crisis, and there are signs that he will continue using Trump\u2019s presidency to reinforce his own image as a champion of the just society. His government recently struck a deal with California to reduce vehicle emissions, while Trudeau has vocally criticised new restrictions on abortion access in a number of Republican-controlled US states.</p> <p>The prime minister is also trying to repair the damage done to his reputation by the SNC-Lavalin scandal, and by the fact that he subsequently forced Wilson-Raybould and another cabinet minister, Jane Philpott, out of the Liberal caucus. \u201cWe worked really hard to try and see if there wasn\u2019t a way of continuing to move forward together,\u201d Trudeau told the audience at a Liberal fundraiser in June.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s completely incompatible with facts,\u201d Philpott told me. \u201cBetween 4 March when I resigned from cabinet and 2 April when I was booted out of caucus, I didn\u2019t have a single conversation with the prime minister. And I had only one phone call from someone in his office.\u201d She added: \u201cThere are times where the image and the narrative that the prime minister\u2019s office wants to put out there is more important than accuracy.\u201d</p> <p>Philpott likened this to another element of Trudeau\u2019s brand that had rung false to her as a former cabinet member: \u201cThe whole listening to women, \u2018diversity is our strength\u2019, that kind of image,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd yet I didn\u2019t feel listened to, and my diverse views didn\u2019t feel like they had a place \u2013 those kinds of things were disappointing.\u201d Philpott is planning on running as an independent in the October election, and said she now had a \u201clovely freedom\u201d from the message control that had coloured all aspects of her job as a Liberal MP.</p> <p>Those behind Trudeau roundly reject the idea of the prime minister as a highly managed brand. \u201cAt the end of the day, he\u2019s not a Nike sneaker,\u201d says Kate Purchase, his executive director of communications and planning, whose responsibilities include vetting posts for his social media accounts. \u201cHe is a leader.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/oct/20/emmanuel-macron-orbiting-jupiter-emmanuel-carrere\">Orbiting Jupiter: my week with Emmanuel Macron</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Purchase pointed to the issues Trudeau addresses, from the anxiety of the middle class to diversity and inclusion, to explain his meteoric rise on the world stage. \u201cThose are things that many governments are struggling with,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople will always describe what they believe the brand to be, and what their version of the brand is, but at the end of the day, I think our brand is what we\u2019ve delivered.\u201d</p> <p>In recent weeks, polls suggest the Liberals have halted their plunge, and are slowly regaining some support. Still, an extraordinary challenge lies head for Trudeau and his team as they head into the October election, says the pollster Shachi Kurl. \u201cHow do you course-correct from something that is less about an event or a policy that people disagree with, and more about a broken brand?\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p>",

          "bodyText": "On the last night of March 2012, Justin Trudeau climbed into a boxing ring in downtown Ottawa, the Canadian capital, intent on rescuing his public image. He was clad in a lustrous red robe, the colour of the Liberal party, for which he was then a junior member of parliament. In the opposite corner, wearing Tory blue, was a young aboriginal leader and Conservative senator named Patrick Brazeau, who is a former navy reservist and a second-degree black belt in karate. Bookies had given the lanky Trudeau, a former high school teacher, three-to-one odds against. The televised match was ostensibly a fundraiser for cancer research, but in Ottawa it became a sensation \u2013 a display of partisan pageantry rarely seen in the staid world of Canadian politics, where \u201cbland works\u201d had been the watchword of one long-serving provincial premier. The fight\u2019s symbolism was lost on no one: in recent years, the Conservatives had battered the Liberals, turning a narrow lead in the 2006 election into a majority government by 2011. The Liberal party, which had governed Canada for much of the 20th century, had been reduced to a historically low number of seats. Trudeau ranked among the best hopes for resuscitating the Liberals and leading them back into power. But his political career, which began in earnest four years earlier, had been dogged by criticisms that he lacked substance and was riding on the coattails of his father, Pierre Trudeau, one of Canada\u2019s longest-serving prime ministers. Barbra Streisand, a former lover of Pierre\u2019s, once described him as a blend of \u201cMarlon Brando and Napoleon\u201d. In contrast, one critic had memorably dubbed Justin \u201cthe Paris Hilton of Canadian politics\u201d. A triumphant bout in the ring could help erode this perception, Trudeau figured. \u201cNever underestimate the power of symbols in today\u2019s world,\u201d he told a documentary film crew chronicling the fight. Within seconds of the opening bell, Brazeau pinned Trudeau against the ropes with an onslaught of heavy jabs. But the Conservative senator soon exhausted himself. Early in the second round, Trudeau seized on the opening, raining down blows on Brazeau. Less than a minute into the third round, as the Liberal MP continued to pummel his opponent, the referee halted the fight and declared Trudeau the winner. That victory was one of the first major triumphs in a branding campaign that helped to transform Trudeau from a politician widely derided as a lightweight into a global political superstar. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t random,\u201d Trudeau told Rolling Stone in 2017, referring to the boxing match. \u201cI wanted someone who would be a good foil, and we stumbled upon the scrappy, tough-guy senator from an Indigenous community \u2026 I saw it as the right kind of narrative, the right story to tell.\u201d In the weeks after the fight, the Canadian media, which had previously portrayed the Liberal MP as a \u201creed-thin, pedigreed Dauphin\u201d, began lauding Trudeau as a public figure of \u201ctoughness, strength, honour and courage\u201d, noted Elise Maiolino, then a PhD candidate in sociology at the University of Toronto, after analysing hundreds of news articles. That change in perception electrified Trudeau\u2019s career, helping to set him on a path to become leader of the Liberal party the following year. Two years after that, in 2015, the Liberals made an unprecedented leap from third-party status to a majority government \u2013 and Trudeau became, like his father before him, the prime minister of Canada. The sort of potent spectacle that characterised his fight with Brazeau was, until recently, a hallmark of Trudeau\u2019s tenure as prime minister. Like Barack Obama, Trudeau seemed to understand better than other politicians how to adapt the old ideas of political marketeering to the new realities of social media. He was a master of the viral video clip or poignant photo that seemed to express the worthiness of his government and the virtue of his politics. He became, as a flurry of academic research has put it, the first prime minister of the Instagram age. \u201cI think he\u2019s probably the best national leader since Ronald Reagan at projecting a certain image,\u201d says Warren Kinsella, a former Liberal strategist. Trudeau has championed a vision of Canada as a nation friendly to allies, open to immigrants and just to its people. According to this image, Canada is a paragon of progressivism in an era marked by strains of authoritarian populism \u2013 as if crossing the border that separates Canada from Donald Trump\u2019s US means travelling through a political looking-glass. And yet, Trudeau was never exactly anti-populist: he cultivated an impression that he both serves the masses and is adored by them. Ironically, but perhaps inevitably, Trudeau\u2019s efforts to depict himself in this way have now helped to set the stage for his potential unmaking. Some of the policies enacted by Trudeau\u2019s government have made his political identity seem hollow, even disingenuous. Compounding this has been the ongoing fallout from the most significant controversy of his tenure: Canada\u2019s ethics watchdog recently found that Trudeau broke the country\u2019s conflict of interest law in the hopes of allowing a giant engineering and construction firm to avoid a corruption trial. The company is facing charges in connection with millions of dollars in bribes allegedly paid to officials in Libya, including members of the Gaddafi regime, between 2001 and 2011. Far from the progressive, transparent government that Trudeau sold to Canadians and the global media, the scandal suggests that, like previous Canadian governments, Trudeau\u2019s administration remains in thrall to the \u201cLaurentian consensus\u201d \u2013 the web of political, business and intellectual elites in Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal whose collective name is a nod to eastern Canada\u2019s mighty St Lawrence river. Ahead of a federal election in October, Trudeau\u2019s approval ratings have plunged from a high of 65% in 2016 to about 32% in July, leaving him vulnerable to becoming the first Canadian prime minister since the 1930s to lose a bid for re-election after winning only one majority mandate. \u201cBrand Trudeau was squeaky clean and fresh and new and a different kind of politics,\u201d says Shachi Kurl, a pollster from the Angus Reid Institute. \u201cAnd it\u2019s turned out that Brand Trudeau is: \u2018Welcome to the new politics, just like the old politics.\u2019\u201d * * * In an age of constant and intimate exposure to celebrities, it may seem unsurprising that the head of government of a country containing less than half of 1% of the world\u2019s population should be so familiar. But how many other Canadian prime ministers have been profiled in the New York Times Magazine, Vogue and Rolling Stone? How many other Canadian prime ministers can most non-Canadians even name, let alone call to mind an image of? One of the extraordinary things about Trudeau is that he is famous in part because he is Canadian \u2013 a remarkably rare kind of fame. Most Canadians who are famous outside of the country have been processed through Hollywood or the US-dominated recording industry. Part of Trudeau\u2019s appeal within Canada, then, is that he assuaged a dual sense of cultural insecurity and superiority, especially with regard to the country\u2019s belligerent southern neighbour. (The majority of Canadians see Trudeau\u2019s fame as a net benefit to the country, according to the Angus Reid Institute.) On the global stage he presented a sort of ideal form \u2013 likable, handsome, virtuous \u2013 in which the country could see its best self. Trudeau\u2019s distinctly Canadian appeal goes even deeper. The prime minister represents a potent idea of Canada and what it means to the world. This idea is perhaps best summed up by a campaign motto of Trudeau\u2019s father, from the late 1960s: \u201cThe just society.\u201d The idea was sold to Canadians as encompassing the protection of civil rights, economic opportunity for all, scientific remedies to environmental problems, greater autonomy for Indigenous people in Canada, and a country in which the language rights of both French and English were enshrined. A great deal of Trudeau\u2019s political cachet within Canada has been inherited from his father. Pierre is a towering figure in Canadian history, who liberalised laws on abortion and homosexuality, entrenched a charter of universal rights and instituted official bilingualism. The Canadian mass media guru Marshall McLuhan, a friendly adviser to Pierre throughout the 15 years he was prime minister, believed that Canada had no fixed identity, giving Pierre an opportunity to act as its \u201cunifying image\u201d. Canada could, in a sense, become what Pierre made it. Even if few Canadians subscribe to McLuhan\u2019s view, it captures something central to how Pierre framed his own tenure as prime minister. The craze for Justin Trudeau during the first years of his prime ministership echoed the \u201cTrudeaumania\u201d of his father\u2019s ascent to power. Pierre, too, captured attention around the world by staging moments of spectacle \u2013 whether it was sliding down a bannister during his 1968 campaign for Liberal leader or pirouetting behind the Queen at Buckingham Palace in 1977. Pierre was \u201cpackaged and presented as a debonair anti-politician who drove sports cars and spent time with pretty women\u201d, writes Alex Marland, a scholar of Canadian political branding at Memorial University. \u201cTo cultivate an image of a pop culture phenomenon\u201d during Canada\u2019s 1968 federal election, he adds, \u201cLiberal strategists recruited young Liberal women to behave as obsessed fanatics\u201d when Pierre was in the presence of reporters. Justin\u2019s attempts to recreate Trudeaumania have involved wading through crowds to allow fans to snap selfies with him \u2013 while his official photographer captures the moment at a slight distance. The results, posted on Instagram, feel like a record of spontaneous adulation, but are actually tightly controlled. As Marland puts it, Trudeau is executing a \u201csimilar playbook\u201d to his father\u2019s, but \u201cin different technological terrain\u201d. Outside the country, Trudeau has played to the world\u2019s eagerness to imagine Canada as a northern utopia untouched by the forces of nationalism and xenophobia. Within the country, however, there are many who think that Liberal Canada has never been the progressive place that Pierre and Justin tried to make it seem. The question now is whether voters believe his son has delivered more than just a good narrative. * * * When a political brand becomes as powerful as Trudeau\u2019s has, it is tempting to read a person\u2019s entire biography as a branding exercise. Things the politician did in their life before politics become plot points in a success story devised by a canny political operator. Ian Capstick, a political commentator who has worked for the Liberals as well as their rivals to the left, the New Democratic party, believes that Trudeau and his longtime friend and adviser Gerald Butts \u201chave been carefully calculating every single entree of Mr Trudeau into Canadian public life for the past 30 years\u201d. He adds: \u201cThere is not a single action that he took publicly that wasn\u2019t considered, reconsidered and put out there in an attempt to eventually build the base that he would require to be prime minister.\u201d Even if this view is a little too cynical, there is no doubt that living his entire life in the public eye has endowed Trudeau with an instinctive, if not infallible, sense of political optics. The beginning of his rise to power has usually been dated to 3 October 2000, when the 28-year-old delivered a dramatic televised eulogy at his father\u2019s state funeral, closing with the words \u201cJe t\u2019aime, papa\u201d, before resting his head on his father\u2019s flag-draped coffin, his tears falling freely. Switchboards at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation lit up with more than 1,000 requests to replay the tribute. Immediately, there was talk of the younger Trudeau entering politics, but many observers felt he lacked gravitas. He had spent his mid-20s drifting between stints as a bar bouncer and snowboard instructor before becoming a schoolteacher. He even admitted, or pretended, to an ignorance of current affairs. \u201cI don\u2019t read the newspapers, I don\u2019t watch the news,\u201d he wrote in the Globe and Mail the year after his father\u2019s death. \u201cI figure, if something important happens, someone will tell me.\u201d Trudeau finally entered politics in 2007, when he began running for parliament in the riding of Papineau, a multicultural district in Montreal, which was represented at the time by a Quebec-nationalist party. During the election in 2008, he grasped something in miniature that Obama demonstrated on a larger scale that same year: that a political brand is not sufficient in and of itself \u2013 you also need a political operation. (Trump, who may not have had much of a grassroots campaign by comparison, is proof of how far such operations have moved to social media.) Trudeau won after mounting a year-long effort to knock on doors and shake hands in the district. It was an impressive start, but Trudeau\u2019s subsequent four years as an MP were generally seen as insipid. It wasn\u2019t until his rout of the Conservative senator Brazeau in the boxing match in 2012 that the larger political tide began to turn for him. Three years later, Trudeau\u2019s fight to become prime minister made his father\u2019s brand his own. In the 2015 general election, Trudeau married the values of the just society with the electoral approach pioneered by Obama, building the infrastructure for a grassroots effort while mounting an aggressive social media campaign. But Trudeau relied more heavily than Obama could on images. \u201cObama\u2019s use of social media was, for lack of a better term, pre-visual,\u201d says Tamara Small, a political science professor at Ontario\u2019s University of Guelph. The election pitted Trudeau against Stephen Harper, a dour Conservative who had governed Canada for nearly a decade. Few expected much of Trudeau, the neophyte leader of Canada\u2019s third-ranked party. \u201cI think that if he comes on stage with his pants on, he will probably exceed expectations,\u201d a Conservative spokesperson told reporters before the first debate. In one famous attack advert, Conservatives labelled Trudeau as \u201cjust not ready\u201d, while mockingly conceding that he has \u201cnice hair, though\u201d. But many Canadians already felt a deep connection to Trudeau. \u201cHe has grown up in the public eye. He was literally born while his father was prime minister,\u201d Marland told me. \u201cHe was a celebrity before he even became prime minister.\u201d This made Trudeau seem regal, yet familiar \u2013 a brand you knew and could trust. Trudeau\u2019s team did everything they could to encourage this intimate connection with their candidate. \u201cIt was probably Canada\u2019s first celebrity politics federal election,\u201d says Huguette Young, a veteran Ottawa journalist and author of Justin Trudeau: The Natural Heir. \u201cThey had Dinner with Justin, just like Dinner with Obama, and contests and you could win a date with Justin. He was almost commodified as a product.\u201d \u201cTrudeau really built his brand in order to counter the brand of Harper,\u201d says Vincent Raynauld, a professor at Boston\u2019s Emerson College who studies Canadian politics. In contrast to his opponent, who was seen as icy and remote, Trudeau promised a return to \u201csunny ways\u201d \u2013 the motto of a much-admired prime minister from the turn of the 20th century. While Harper mooted banning the niqab at Canadian citizenship ceremonies and launching a hotline to ferret out what his party called \u201cbarbaric cultural practices\u201d, Trudeau made a passionate defence of multiculturalism and immigration. These were only two of the areas in which Trudeau promised to \u201cdo politics differently\u201d. In a country where women make up just 26% of MPs, he promised to usher in a new age of gender equality \u2013 beginning by naming a cabinet comprised of as many women as men. In what would have constituted a direct challenge to his own party\u2019s dominance, Trudeau pledged to make space for smaller political parties by reforming Canada\u2019s first-past-the-post electoral system. He vowed to reset the country\u2019s relationship with its disproportionately disadvantaged Indigenous peoples. All in all, the Liberal manifesto made 353 specific policy promises. After almost a decade of Harper, there was a widespread desire for change. Presented with two very different images of Canada\u2019s future, voters responded with a clear answer. On 19 October 2015, the Liberal party swept back to power by picking up 148 seats on top of the 36 they already held in Canada\u2019s 338-member parliament. It was the largest increase in seats in Canadian history. * * * As Trudeau took office, his focus on optics was on full display. The often sedate swearing-in of a new government was thrown open to the public and turned into a highly stage-managed, live-streamed event. Trudeau was due to arrive by coach at the prime minister\u2019s official residence, 24 Sussex Drive, where he spent his childhood. (The house has been under renovation since Trudeau took office, and he and his family have been living in a 22-room guest house nearby.) To avoid any inelegant photos or video \u2013 \u201cGetting off a bus is such an ugly shot,\u201d Trudeau told his communications director that morning, in comments captured by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation \u2013 Trudeau\u2019s team misled the media about where they should meet the new prime minister, ensuring that the first images the press got were of him strolling from 24 Sussex to the governor general\u2019s official residence, Rideau Hall, where the ceremony would take place. At another point that morning, Trudeau and his team were preparing to respond to the question of why he was appointing a gender-balanced cabinet. \u201cI think just calling people\u2019s attention to the year is all you really need to say,\u201d Gerald Butts, Trudeau\u2019s right-hand man, told him. The advice yielded one of Trudeau\u2019s most internationally famous lines: \u201cBecause it\u2019s 2015.\u201d Around the same time, Trudeau\u2019s team was courting international attention, prioritising interviews with the New York Times and a sultry photoshoot for Vogue with his wife, Sophie, over interviews with Canadian media. \u201cThat was very, very deliberate,\u201d said Susan Delacourt, a journalist at the Toronto Star. \u201cThere was a sense that Canadians would like that.\u201d Many Canadians initially did, interpreting the attention as a sign of Trudeau\u2019s place among progressive world leaders at a time when Obama was still president and Hillary Clinton seemed poised to succeed him, Delacourt added. Trudeau moved his official photographer into an office two doors down from his own. A mix of intimate and public photo ops \u2013 of the prime minister cuddling with pandas, greeting Syrian refugees as they landed on Canadian soil, throwing punches in a Brooklyn boxing gym \u2013 transformed Trudeau from a politician into a series of memes. During his first year in power, barely a week went by without some sort of viral moment from the prime minister that found its way into people\u2019s daily lives as they scrolled through Snapchat on the bus or perused Instagram in bed. As Trudeau content appeared on social media shorn of context, it created new realities: a rehearsed explanation of quantum computing became a show of Trudeau\u2019s intellectual prowess; an innocuous cough on a visit to Washington DC became an example of Trudeau trolling the president. A vital part of Trudeau\u2019s brand was the contrast between him and the far-right politicians gaining ground around the world. In the US, Trump was on a journey that in some ways echoed Trudeau\u2019s, parlaying his celebrity status into political power. When it came to optics, though, \u201cTrump was a gift\u201d for Trudeau, says Philippe Garneau, a corporate branding executive whose brother Marc ran against Trudeau for the Liberal leadership and is a minister in Trudeau\u2019s cabinet. \u201cI remember being worried. I said: \u2018How can we put a man who has a degree in teaching and [who taught] drama, sit him down with Angela Merkel and across from Putin?\u2019 And in walks Potus and upsets the whole apple cart,\u201d Garneau went on. \u201cSo Trudeau got lucky. He was never shown to be the youngest, newest, greenest member at the table, but rather some sort of version of youthful exuberance, enthusiasm, optimism and a lack of cynicism.\u201d When Trump pushed through his ban on travellers from a number of Muslim-majority countries, Trudeau tweeted that Canada would welcome those fleeing persecution, regardless of their faith. As accusations of sexual misconduct piled up against Trump, Trudeau proclaimed his own feminism in the pages of Marie Claire. As Trump vowed to put America first, Trudeau said Canada was \u201cback\u201d as a global player. Trudeau\u2019s contrast with Trump was successfully memefied when the two leaders met in February 2017. Trump\u2019s opening salvo with other world leaders had been an uncomfortably long, domineering handshake. Days earlier, Shinz\u014d Abe, Japan\u2019s prime minister, had been left reeling after a grip that dragged on for 19 seconds. Trudeau agonised for weeks about finding a technique that could show he was capable of holding his own, but which wouldn\u2019t antagonise the man now at the helm of Canada\u2019s largest trading partner. Eventually, he and his team decided on a combination handshake and shoulder grab. According to Politico, Trudeau and his senior aides spent part of their flight to Washington DC practising it. The rehearsal paid off: Trudeau was hailed around the world for the handshake he unleashed on Trump. Viral videos of the seconds-long power struggle overshadowed a visit in which Trudeau stood by silently \u2013 later telling reporters that it was not his place to lecture another country \u2013 as Trump unapologetically defended his controversial travel ban. It was part of a pattern in which Trudeau and his team produced globally viral images that starved important political issues of oxygen. In 2017, at the height of an opioid epidemic that had claimed a record number of overdose victims in Vancouver, Trudeau\u2019s official photographer took an opportunistic photo of the prime minister running past a crowd of high schoolers on their prom night. Criticisms that the Trudeau government had not done enough to address the opioid crisis were buried by viral photos of the prime minister in running shorts and a T-shirt surrounded by students in suits and floor-length gowns. In politics, however, reality has a way of catching up with you. Eventually, the scandal, instead of the photo op, is what goes viral. * * * In retrospect, it seems predictable that a brand so well-devised, so symbolic and emotive, would encourage idealisations that in reality no politician could match. In 2018, some three years after Trudeau took power, cracks began showing in Trudeau\u2019s glossy veneer. In February, Trudeau and his family made an eight-day visit to India that was described to me by his former foreign policy adviser, Roland Paris, as perhaps \u201cthe worst trip that a Canadian prime minister has ever taken abroad\u201d. Although Trudeau sat down with his Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi, and attended a handful of other bilateral meetings, what gained traction on social media were photos of the prime minister flouncing around in traditional Indian outfits. The result was a trip that seemed heavy on Bhangra moves but light on official business. \u201cIndia crystallised a lot of misgivings that liberals had that he was perhaps not as mature as we would like, he was not as prime ministerial as we would like, he was a little gimmicky and not taking it seriously with the world\u2019s largest democracy,\u201d Warren Kinsella, the former Liberal strategist, told me. Months later, Trudeau\u2019s feminist credentials took a hit after an allegation resurfaced that he had groped a reporter at an event in 2000. While acknowledging that he did apologise at the time to the reporter after she confronted him, Trudeau has said he is confident that he did not act inappropriately. Criticism grew that Trudeau\u2019s government was merely tinkering around the edges of change, masking their political inaction with a steady diet of unexpected moments and big talk. \u201cWe\u2019ve done check box, check box, check box,\u201d says Celina Caesar-Chavannes, an MP and former parliamentary secretary to the prime minister who resigned from the Liberal caucus after a dispute with Trudeau. \u201cBut how does it really transform the lives of people who don\u2019t have Trudeau\u2019s privilege, who don\u2019t have my privilege?\u201d Caesar-Chavannes argues that Trudeau\u2019s government has made small changes but consistently shies away from the bold, transformational work he promised in a campaign built around the slogan, \u201cReal Change\u201d. \u201cI think there were some decisions around our ability to be re-elected as opposed to doing politics differently,\u201d she says. Caesar-Chavannes gave me a number of examples of this sort of policymaking. Trudeau\u2019s government legalised marijuana but rebuffed a call to expunge the records of those convicted of simple possession, even though prosecutions had disproportionately targeted people with low-incomes and Canadians of colour. Trudeau appointed a gender-balanced cabinet, but refused to reform the country\u2019s electoral system, which would have paved the way for more female lawmakers. He promised a \u201ctotal renewal\u201d of Canada\u2019s relationship with Indigenous communities, but his government has done little to address the mould-ridden housing and lack of clean drinking water that has left many Indigenous communities living in \u201cHaiti at -40C\u201d, as a politician from the New Democratic party has put it. After vowing to prioritise the fight against climate change and criticising Saudi Arabia\u2019s treatment of human rights advocates, Trudeau\u2019s government bought a C$4.5bn (\u00a32.8bn) pipeline to better transport Alberta\u2019s landlocked bitumen to international markets and signed off on the sale of more than 900 armoured vehicles to Riyadh. And, after much of the international hype over its welcoming stance on refugees had died down, the government quietly introduced legislation this April that makes it harder for some migrants to seek asylum. Despite Trudeau selling himself as an open and transparent leader, several sources within the government described the centralisation of power in his office, with the prime minister\u2019s inner circle playing the role of his gatekeepers. This is typical of highly branded politicians \u2013 the pressure to keep the whole government on message encourages top-down control \u2013 but Trudeau may have taken it to an extreme. St\u00e9phane Dion served as Trudeau\u2019s foreign minister for 14 months, and during that time he didn\u2019t manage to land a single one-on-one meeting with the prime minister despite multiple requests, says Jocelyn Coulon, a former senior policy advisor to Dion. (Dion declined my request for a comment.) Trudeau\u2019s supporters point to the ways in which he has lived up to his promises. Since 2015, more than 44,000 Syrian refugees have been settled in Canada, compared with the 2,300 that Stephen Harper\u2019s government took in between 2013 and 2015. Trudeau\u2019s tenure so far has seen 278,000 children lifted out of poverty, a feat credited to the country\u2019s buoyant economy as well as a marquee child-benefit programme that provides direct funds to the country\u2019s poorest families. The government raised taxes on the top 1%, while cutting income tax for those in the middle bracket. And, while Canada is expected to fall short of its target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% below 2005 levels by 2030, Trudeau and his government have taken fledgling steps towards tackling climate change with legislation mandating a price on carbon in every province. Perhaps Trudeau\u2019s shortcomings wouldn\u2019t have dominated public discussion in Canada for much of this year if a single large scandal hadn\u2019t focused Canadians on the gap between Trudeau the brand and his actions while in government. In February, Trudeau was accused of trying to bully his justice minister, Jody Wilson-Raybould, into helping SNC-Lavalin, a Quebec-based engineering and construction company, avoid a corruption trial. Wilson-Raybould testified to a parliamentary committee earlier this year that Trudeau and his staff were worried that, if prosecuted, the company would move its head offices out of Montreal, potentially killing thousands of jobs and alienating voters in Quebec, home to a large number of strategically important parliamentary seats. Alongside the suggestion that Trudeau wanted to put his electoral success ahead of the integrity of the legal process, there was another layer to the scandal. Wilson-Raybould herself had once been a potent symbol of the Trudeau brand: she was the first Indigenous person and only the third woman to hold the post of justice minister. But the way she had been pressured by Trudeau and his team included \u201cundeniable elements of misogyny\u201d, she told the committee. Earlier this month, Canada\u2019s ethics commissioner concluded Trudeau had violated the country\u2019s ethics rules when he used his office to \u201ccircumvent, undermine and ultimately attempt to discredit\u201d Wilson-Raybould. * * * When Canadians head to the polls in October, a central question will be whether Trudeau\u2019s image is so badly tarnished that the Liberal party\u2019s vision of Canada will seem less appealing, and less realistic, than the vision on offer by the parties to its right and left. As things stand, Trudeau\u2019s main opponent is the Conservative leader, Andrew Scheer. Scheer has vowed to roll back carbon taxes, opposed UN efforts to promote global cooperation on migration and wants to move Canada\u2019s embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. He has also appointed a former board member of Rebel Media, a far-right website that has been described as Breitbart North, as his campaign manager. In order to hang on to votes in the diverse suburbs that ring Toronto, which have proven decisive in recent elections, Liberals have been highlighting Scheer\u2019s divisiveness on issues of race and immigration. Trudeau has also drawn attention to the Conservative party\u2019s poor record on the climate crisis, and there are signs that he will continue using Trump\u2019s presidency to reinforce his own image as a champion of the just society. His government recently struck a deal with California to reduce vehicle emissions, while Trudeau has vocally criticised new restrictions on abortion access in a number of Republican-controlled US states. The prime minister is also trying to repair the damage done to his reputation by the SNC-Lavalin scandal, and by the fact that he subsequently forced Wilson-Raybould and another cabinet minister, Jane Philpott, out of the Liberal caucus. \u201cWe worked really hard to try and see if there wasn\u2019t a way of continuing to move forward together,\u201d Trudeau told the audience at a Liberal fundraiser in June. \u201cThat\u2019s completely incompatible with facts,\u201d Philpott told me. \u201cBetween 4 March when I resigned from cabinet and 2 April when I was booted out of caucus, I didn\u2019t have a single conversation with the prime minister. And I had only one phone call from someone in his office.\u201d She added: \u201cThere are times where the image and the narrative that the prime minister\u2019s office wants to put out there is more important than accuracy.\u201d Philpott likened this to another element of Trudeau\u2019s brand that had rung false to her as a former cabinet member: \u201cThe whole listening to women, \u2018diversity is our strength\u2019, that kind of image,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd yet I didn\u2019t feel listened to, and my diverse views didn\u2019t feel like they had a place \u2013 those kinds of things were disappointing.\u201d Philpott is planning on running as an independent in the October election, and said she now had a \u201clovely freedom\u201d from the message control that had coloured all aspects of her job as a Liberal MP. Those behind Trudeau roundly reject the idea of the prime minister as a highly managed brand. \u201cAt the end of the day, he\u2019s not a Nike sneaker,\u201d says Kate Purchase, his executive director of communications and planning, whose responsibilities include vetting posts for his social media accounts. \u201cHe is a leader.\u201d Purchase pointed to the issues Trudeau addresses, from the anxiety of the middle class to diversity and inclusion, to explain his meteoric rise on the world stage. \u201cThose are things that many governments are struggling with,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople will always describe what they believe the brand to be, and what their version of the brand is, but at the end of the day, I think our brand is what we\u2019ve delivered.\u201d In recent weeks, polls suggest the Liberals have halted their plunge, and are slowly regaining some support. Still, an extraordinary challenge lies head for Trudeau and his team as they head into the October election, says the pollster Shachi Kurl. \u201cHow do you course-correct from something that is less about an event or a policy that people disagree with, and more about a broken brand?\u201d \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

          "body": "<p>You may have noticed that socks aren\u2019t what they used to be. Think back: for a long time socks were just something you used to cover your feet. Possibly black, probably ankle-height and definitely an afterthought.

In 2017, kicked off by the Vetements\u2019 socks with the DHL logo teeT-shirt, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/jul/10/footsie-100-why-socks-have-become-the-latest-menswear-battleground\" title=\"\">they</a> became \u201cthe most loaded accessory of the year\u201d, according to the GQ columnist Justin Myers. Prada played with pulling socks up to men\u2019s knees and, thanks to logomania, socks have become a more affordable way for fashion fans to conspicuously buy into their favourite designer labels.</p> <p>If none of this is ringing any bells, then it might mean it\u2019s time to reassess your sock game. This is where the rules come in, because, <a href=\"https://14tothefullest.wordpress.com/2017/06/22/rules-control-the-fun-why-monica-from-friends-was-right/\" title=\"\">in the words of Monica Geller from Friends</a>: \u201cRules help control the fun.\u201d <em>EVB</em></p> <h2><strong>What kind of socks should I be wearing now?</strong></h2> <p>What kind of socks would you like to wear? Given the proliferation of styles, there is a good sock option for everyone. According to the stylist Bemi Shaw, you can never go wrong with a sports sock. \u201cThey add a bit of edge to a basic outfit and make streetwear look more authentic.\u201d</p> <p>A Matisse-bright pair, like you\u2019ll find at Arket, is an easy way to elevate a thrown-on outfit. At John Lewis, according to Elena Bergonzi, a fashion accessories buyer, classic sport socks are proving popular, \u201cbut also glitter and animal prints for the fashion-forward customer\u201d. <em>EVB</em></p> <h2><strong>Is it ever OK to wear socks with sandals?</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8c52587b8493f225311e2e1da0a4112fbec7a68f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c52587b8493f225311e2e1da0a4112fbec7a68f/0_0_2598_3898/666.jpg\" alt=\"Socks with sandals at the Sies Marjan show, Paris Men\u2019s fashion week, Spring/Summer 2020\" width=\"666\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Socks with sandals at the Sies Marjan show, Paris Men\u2019s fashion week, spring/summer 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Estrop/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To this, the answer is a definite: Yes. But again, make clear it is deliberate. As the sock-styling expert and Man Repeller journalist <a href=\"https://www.manrepeller.com/2019/04/socks-and-sandals-summer.html\" title=\"\">Harling Ross</a><a href=\"https://www.manrepeller.com/2019/04/socks-and-sandals-summer.html\" title=\"\"> has noted</a>, explicit coordination makes it clear that any unusual use of accessories is intentional. If you\u2019re feeling a bit hesitant, see the sophisticated version of the socks and sandals look as touted at the most recent Agnona show. Socks were paired with sandals of the same shade or just a little different; a subtler way to dip a toe. Or, one step up: <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2020-menswear/sies-marjan/slideshow/collection#20\" title=\"\">look to the styling of duck-egg-blue socks with navy-blue sandals</a> at spring/summer 2020 Sies Marjan menswear show. <em>EVB</em></p> <h2><strong>Should I wear my socks pulled up?</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"74e5bd2980ec22adbaa612812ad2052927969a97\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74e5bd2980ec22adbaa612812ad2052927969a97/0_0_3558_5337/667.jpg\" alt=\"Pull your socks up: worn with suspenders at London Fashion Week Men\u2019s, 2018\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Socks worn with suspenders at London fashion week men\u2019s, 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Edward Berthelot/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIs there another way to wear your socks?\u201d Shaw asks. For her, pulling them up \u201clooks the best but also avoids the awkward bunching that can look like cankles\u201d.</p> <p>There\u2019s an easy sartorial win to be had for men in shorts and sports socks just by pulling them up \u2013 but be sure to look like you mean it. Charlie Teasdale, Esquire\u2019s style director, also thinks socks should be pulled up \u201cin any vaguely formal situation\u201d \u2013 he even suggests, \u201cif you were so inclined\u201d, investing in some sock suspenders. <em>EVB</em></p> <h2><strong>Is it </strong><strong>OK to wear white socks?</strong></h2> <p>Yes and no. Yes, when playing sport; no, when wearing a suit \u2013 until recently that is. Now, it is the subversive nature of white socks that makes them so appealing, says the fashion stylist Tom Stubbs, who wears his with Prada penny loafers. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s so good about them, they\u2019re wrong!\u201d he says. \u201cFor a tiny bit of man-hosiery, [they are] freighted with controversy \u2026 They appear synonymous with the 80s, a decade decreed fundamentally bad stylistically. This obviously adds to the attraction.\u201d So when to wear them? \u201cWhenever you want to break the norm \u2026 socks don\u2019t usually have attitude \u2013 but these white fellas defo do.\u201d <em>SC</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aa46a467391833208d1f6b3af9dd7c3234bbc2d4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa46a467391833208d1f6b3af9dd7c3234bbc2d4/0_218_2528_3574/707.jpg\" alt=\"White socks with penny loafers: fashion stylist Tom Stubbs.\" width=\"707\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">White socks with penny loafers: fashion stylist Tom Stubbs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Edward Berthelot/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Where is a fiver best spent on socks?</strong></h2> <p>\u201cAsos has a great selection of socks for decent prices,\u201d says Shaw. <a href=\"https://uk.calzedonia.com/thumbnail/women/socks/short-socks/pc/50118/c/50188/51164.uts?numberOfEntities=36&amp;restRefinementValueIds=\" title=\"\">Calzedonia</a> has spotty, fishnet and preppy Argyle styles galore. A supermarket pair of white cotton socks plus some dye and string will allow you to make your own take on the tie-dye sock trend.

          "bodyText": "You may have noticed that socks aren\u2019t what they used to be. Think back: for a long time socks were just something you used to cover your feet. Possibly black, probably ankle-height and definitely an afterthought. Socks are now an important part of your outfit at the least, the making of an outfit at most. Socks have become an area of diplomacy and woke-signalling \u2013 the Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau is perhaps the biggest name to use socks in this way, choosing pointedly themed ones for public occasions. Or a telling insight into a political mind: Boris Johnson was criticised recently for not washing his lucky socks, emblazoned with a ruler of the Neo-Assyrian empire King Ashurbanipal, often enough. In fashion, statement socks have been big for a few years. In 2017, kicked off by the Vetements\u2019 socks with the DHL logo teeT-shirt, they became \u201cthe most loaded accessory of the year\u201d, according to the GQ columnist Justin Myers. Prada played with pulling socks up to men\u2019s knees and, thanks to logomania, socks have become a more affordable way for fashion fans to conspicuously buy into their favourite designer labels. If none of this is ringing any bells, then it might mean it\u2019s time to reassess your sock game. This is where the rules come in, because, in the words of Monica Geller from Friends: \u201cRules help control the fun.\u201d EVB What kind of socks should I be wearing now? What kind of socks would you like to wear? Given the proliferation of styles, there is a good sock option for everyone. According to the stylist Bemi Shaw, you can never go wrong with a sports sock. \u201cThey add a bit of edge to a basic outfit and make streetwear look more authentic.\u201d A Matisse-bright pair, like you\u2019ll find at Arket, is an easy way to elevate a thrown-on outfit. At John Lewis, according to Elena Bergonzi, a fashion accessories buyer, classic sport socks are proving popular, \u201cbut also glitter and animal prints for the fashion-forward customer\u201d. EVB Is it ever OK to wear socks with sandals? To this, the answer is a definite: Yes. But again, make clear it is deliberate. As the sock-styling expert and Man Repeller journalist Harling Ross has noted, explicit coordination makes it clear that any unusual use of accessories is intentional. If you\u2019re feeling a bit hesitant, see the sophisticated version of the socks and sandals look as touted at the most recent Agnona show. Socks were paired with sandals of the same shade or just a little different; a subtler way to dip a toe. Or, one step up: look to the styling of duck-egg-blue socks with navy-blue sandals at spring/summer 2020 Sies Marjan menswear show. EVB Should I wear my socks pulled up? \u201cIs there another way to wear your socks?\u201d Shaw asks. For her, pulling them up \u201clooks the best but also avoids the awkward bunching that can look like cankles\u201d. There\u2019s an easy sartorial win to be had for men in shorts and sports socks just by pulling them up \u2013 but be sure to look like you mean it. Charlie Teasdale, Esquire\u2019s style director, also thinks socks should be pulled up \u201cin any vaguely formal situation\u201d \u2013 he even suggests, \u201cif you were so inclined\u201d, investing in some sock suspenders. EVB Is it OK to wear white socks? Yes and no. Yes, when playing sport; no, when wearing a suit \u2013 until recently that is. Now, it is the subversive nature of white socks that makes them so appealing, says the fashion stylist Tom Stubbs, who wears his with Prada penny loafers. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s so good about them, they\u2019re wrong!\u201d he says. \u201cFor a tiny bit of man-hosiery, [they are] freighted with controversy \u2026 They appear synonymous with the 80s, a decade decreed fundamentally bad stylistically. This obviously adds to the attraction.\u201d So when to wear them? \u201cWhenever you want to break the norm \u2026 socks don\u2019t usually have attitude \u2013 but these white fellas defo do.\u201d SC Where is a fiver best spent on socks? \u201cAsos has a great selection of socks for decent prices,\u201d says Shaw. Calzedonia has spotty, fishnet and preppy Argyle styles galore. A supermarket pair of white cotton socks plus some dye and string will allow you to make your own take on the tie-dye sock trend. While if it\u2019s volume over style points you\u2019re after, you can\u2019t beat a seven-pack of cotton-blend navy socks from M&amp;S. EVB If I\u2019m going to buy one expensive pair of socks, which should I get? What is understood by expensive socks will, of course, vary wildly. Shaw\u2019s tried-and-tested choice are Calvin Klein: \u201cI remember getting a pair for Christmas and realising that this was what heaven must feel like.\u201d If you want high-level comfort, try Toast\u2019s recycled cashmere (\u00a324) or the Scottish cashmere socks from Brora (\u00a339 to \u00a385). If you\u2019re in it for the lolz, look no further than this Don\u2019t Trip tie-dye pair for $28 (\u00a323). Or for a pair just a little elevated from the others in your sock drawer, try these \u00a312 organic cotton, sustainably dyed ones from Brothers We Stand. EVB What material should socks be made from? Most socks are made from a blend of materials and those that include elastane are likely to be a better, more comfortable fit. Bamboo fibre socks absorb moisture and boast antibacterial and antifungal properties. \u201cBamboo socks aren\u2019t quite as green as they may appear, due to the processing of the bamboo and dyes,\u201d says Steve Hynd, campaign manager at City to Sea. \u201cLook out for organic cotton certified by Gots (global organic textile standard), which means your socks will be independently checked throughout the supply chain.

As Myers puts it: \u201cIf you are going sockless, make sure you \u2026 wear socks.\u201d This is where trainer socks come in.

According to a bombshell report by Canada\u2019s ethics commissioner, Trudeau engaged in \u201cflagrant attempts to influence\u201d his attorney general and minister of justice, Jody Wilson-Raybould. The ruling marks a major blow to Trudeau\u2019s governing Liberal party less than 10 weeks before a general election.

          "bodyText": "The Australian manufacturer of weapons systems being sold to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates has maintained none of its products have ever been used in Yemen. The chief executive of EOS Defence Systems, Ben Greene, defended the company against suggestions its equipment had been, would be, or could be used in any human rights violations. Greene also said the equipment sent to the UAE was only a demonstration unit ahead of future sales. Last week it was revealed the Australian government had approved the export of Australian weapons systems to the two Gulf nations, despite global concern about the supply of weapons to countries in the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, which has been accused of human rights violations and atrocities. Photographs taken inside Sydney\u2019s international airport showed the shipments were destined to Saudi and UAE government forces, with some sent the same week a UK court ruled it illegal to sell arms to Saudi Arabia. The photographs also identified the sellers as Australian firm Electro Optics Systems (EOS), and ATK Alliance Techsystems Operations (Orbital ATK), a US-based company which sells EOS equipment. EOS was first identified as a supplier in December, but it would not confirm who the buyer was, instead saying only that its products had never gone to Yemen. In the wake of last week\u2019s story, EOS maintained its assertion that \u201cno EOS product has, at any time, been deployed to or used in Yemen\u201d. \u201cFurthermore, no EOS product has been supplied to military forces which have been or are currently deployed to Yemen.\u201d Internal documents obtained by the ABC showed the company previously said that Saudi Arabia\u2019s ministry of interior, to whom the weapons were intended, had no mandate to operate beyond the Saudi-Yemen border. Greene told Guardian Australia he had personally gone through reported lists of human rights violations in Yemen, and confirmed none involved equipment which EOS or its competitors produced. Greene said the equipment sent to Saudi Arabia was supplied for US programs to support the Saudi Ministry of Interior for its border operations, and did not cross over. \u201cWe are physically in contact with the equipment,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to install it and maintain it.\u201d He said EOS employees or local Saudi contractors would perform maintenance on the equipment every few weeks on average, which could range from cracked glass to bullet holes. He said much of the equipment sent to Saudi Arabia had not left warehouses yet. Asked about the shipments to the UAE, Greene said \u201cnothing has been delivered to the UAE\u201d. Asked about a photograph of a shipment inside Sydney airport, which listed the beneficiary as the UAE Armed Forces Joint Logistics Command in Abu Dhabi, Greene first said the photo could be faked, or that the shipment was either still at the airport or in the air. The photographed label shows the package was consigned to EOS\u2019s Abu Dhabi office. Greene said the EOS office was the recipient of the system and the UAE Armed Forces were listed as beneficiary because it had to approve the import licence. It was the first time the R400S system had been sent to EOS in the UAE, he said, and related to a $450m contract announced in February for remote weapon systems for UAE Navy and for critical UAE infrastructure protection. \u201cIt has no lethality whatsoever, its purpose is only for demonstration and test,\u201d said Greene. \u201cIt\u2019s tested in advance of future shipments which might happen. \u201cSubsequently at some stage later on, if the shipments start under the contract we\u2019ve already announced, that could make up part of our shipments.\u201d Charities have warned Australia\u2019s approach is undermining global efforts to prevent foreign weapons being used in the war in Yemen. Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, Finland and Germany have all refused to sell arms to Saudi Arabia. In February, Germany extended its arms exports ban despite pressure to back down. Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has previously threatened to cancel a multimillion-dollar defence contract in response to the killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Save the Children\u2019s policy and advocacy adviser, Kavitha Suthanthiraraj, said Australia should follow Europe\u2019s lead. Suthanthiraraj said the conflict had already resulted in the deaths of 85,000 children \u201cfrom causes including starvation, malnutrition and disease\u201d. \u201cThe reported sale and export of Australian-made weapon systems to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates is deeply concerning and undermine global efforts to prevent foreign weapons being used in the war in Yemen,\u201d she said. \u201cBoth Saudi Arabia and the UAE have been accused of extensive human rights abuses in Yemen, including the targeting of civilians, which the UN said may amount to war crimes.\u201d Ghassan Hage, a spokesman for the Gulf Institute for Democracy and Human Rights, urged the Australian government to \u201crespect and carefully consider\u201d the decisions of those countries which have stopped or are considering ending exports to the Saudi-led coalition. \u201cAustralia is obligated by international standards [set] on 24 December 2014 when Australia became a signatory to the international Arms Trade Treaty,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must prevent our national industry from getting involved in human rights violations.\u201d",

Leo Varadkar appears to have been pushed back in the queue with no arrangements yet in place for the conventional call that takes place when new leaders assume office in Ireland and the UK. Johnson has already spoken to five leaders around the world including Donald Trump on Friday, who later revealed he talked about doing a trade deal \u201cfive times\u201d the size of existing arrangements with the UK. Also on Friday, Johnson contacted the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, to discuss a Brexit transition and in his first two days of office he spoke to Angela Merkel, Emmanuel Macron and Jean-Claude Juncker. The lack of contact with the taoiseach will add to the existing strains in Anglo-Irish relations since Johnson assumed power, with new tensions over remarks on the risks to Northern Ireland\u2019s place in the United Kingdom. Varadkar said on Friday evening that \u201cmore and more people in Northern Ireland will come to question the union\u201d if the UK crashed out of the EU, putting the region, which voted to remain, into a new historical chapter with the rest of the island of Ireland. \u201cPeople who you might describe as moderate nationalists, or moderate Catholics, who are more or less happy with the status quo, will look towards a united Ireland.

DUP Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson said the \u201chysterical and self-centred\u201d response of the Irish government to the demands of the UK prime minister to have the backstop removed from any exit deal speaks volumes. \u201cThe megaphone reaction demonstrates that the blatant attempts by Leo Varadkar and co to use the Irish border as a means of undermining Britain\u2019s referendum has backfired on them and they know it. \u201cThe Irish government walked the world stage and styled themselves as the victims of British aggression. \u2018Poor little Ireland\u2019 may have worked in the past but people are growing tired of the same old tune. The game is up. \u201cThey have overplayed their hand and they need to change course.\u201d Varadkar also said he would need to meet Johnson to understand his \u201creal red lines\u201d on Brexit, and that Ireland had shown in the past that it could be flexible. Johnson has already spoken to other leaders in the UK including Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, the DUP leader, Arlene Foster, and Michelle O\u2019Neill, the head of Sinn F\u00e9in in Northern Ireland. On Friday Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, described Johnson\u2019s comments on Brexit as \u201cunhelpful\u201d and said he appeared to be putting the UK on a \u201ccollision course\u201d with the EU. He made his remarks after what he described as a \u201cuseful\u201d meeting with Julian Smith, the new Northern Ireland secretary, who went to Belfast for a series of meetings aimed at getting the Stormont assembly up and running again. Downing Street has been approached for comment.",

Good instincts, proper instincts, noble instincts. </p> \n   <p>And the equally noble instinct to share. And to give everyone a fair chance in life. And to look after the poorest and the neediest and to build a great society. </p> \n   <p>And on the whole in the last 200 years it is we Conservatives who have understood best how to encourage those instincts, to work together in harmony to promote the good of the whole country. </p> \n   <p>And today at this pivotal moment in our history we again have to reconcile two sets of instincts, two noble sets of instincts. </p> \n   <p>Between the deep desire of friendship and free trade and mutual support in security and defence between Britain and our European partners. </p> \n   <p>And the simultaneous desire, equally deep and heartfelt, for democratic self-government in this country. </p> \n   <p>And of course, there are some people who say that they\u2019re irreconcilable and it just can\u2019t be done. </p> \n   <p>And indeed I read in my Financial Times this morning, devoted reader that I am - seriously, it is a great, great, great British brand. </p> \n   <p>I read in my Financial Times this morning that there is no incoming leader, no incoming leader has ever faced such a set of daunting circumstances, it said. </p> \n   <p>Well, I look at you this morning and I ask myself, do you look daunted?

I don\u2019t think you look remotely daunted to me. </p> \n   <p>And I think that we know we can do it and that the people of this country are trusting in us to do it and we know that we will do it. </p> \n   <p>And we know the mantra of the campaign that has just gone by, in case you have forgotten it and you probably have, it is deliver Brexit, unite the country and defeat Jeremy Corbyn - and that is what we are going to do. </p> \n   <p>We are all going to defeat Jeremy Corbyn. </p> \n   <p>I know that some wag has already pointed out that deliver, unite and defeat was not the perfect acronym for an election campaign, since unfortunately it spells dud - but they forgot the final \u2018e\u2019 my friends, \u2018e\u2019 for energise. </p> \n   <p>And I say to all the doubters, dude, we are going to energise the country. </p> \n   <p>We are going to get Brexit done on October 31. </p> \n   <p>We are going to take advantage of all the opportunities that it will bring in a new spirit of can-do. </p> \n   <p>And we are once again going to believe in ourselves and what we can achieve. </p> \n   <p>And like some slumbering giant, we are going to rise and ping off the guy ropes of self-doubt and negativity, with better education, better infrastructure, more police, fantastic full-fibre broadband sprouting in every household - we are going to unite this amazing country and we are going to take it forward. </p> \n   <p>I thank you all very much for the incredible honour that you have just done me. </p> \n   <p>I will work flat out from now on with my team that I will build, I hope in the next few days, to repay your confidence, but in the meantime the campaign is over and the work begins. </p> \n   <p>Thank you all very much.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"589067fbdefc285fc2055689846d189ad57d1c75\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/589067fbdefc285fc2055689846d189ad57d1c75/0_156_4968_2981/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson giving his leadership speech.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson giving his leadership speech.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Neil Hall/EPA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-23T12:30:38.713Z\">at 1.30pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d36fc538f08cf92bb7754e6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-23T12:24:10.719Z\">1.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Jo Swinson,</strong> the new Lib Dem leader, says Boris Johnson is not fit to be PM.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/joswinson/status/1153627408987250688\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Boris Johnson has shown time and time again that he isn\u2019t fit to be the Prime Minister of our country.<br><br>Britain deserves better than Boris Johnson. <a href=\"https://t.co/ZkcEMzxJin\">https://t.co/ZkcEMzxJin</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/JoinJo?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#JoinJo</a></p>\u2014 Jo Swinson (@joswinson) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/joswinson/status/1153627408987250688?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 23, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d36fba88f0845f89e312a37\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-23T12:23:10.520Z\">1.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>And here is <strong>Michel Barnier</strong>, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, on Boris Johnson\u2019s election.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MichelBarnier/status/1153623849357008902\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We look forward to working constructively w/ PM <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@BorisJohnson</a> when he takes office, to facilitate the ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement and achieve an orderly <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Brexit?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Brexit</a>.

It was also rather thin for someone who has spent the last four weeks certain almost beyond doubt that they would become the next prime minister. But Johnson will be giving a speech in Downing Street tomorrow, which will receive more attention, he is expected to make a statement to MPs on Thursday, and he is scheduled to give a major speech at the end of this week. Now was not really the time for a major statement of intent. </p> \n  <p>Still, in an extract buried in the middle of the speech, there were two clues as to where he intends to go. Here is key passage.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If you look at the history of the last 200 years of this party\u2019s existence, you will see that it is we Conservatives who have had the best insights, I think, into human nature, and the best insights into how to manage the jostling sets of instincts in the human heart. </p> \n   <p>And time again it is to us that the people of this country have turned to get that balance right, between the instincts to own your own home, to earn and spend your own money, to look after your own family \u2013 good instincts, proper instincts, noble instincts \u2013 and the equally noble instinct to share and to give everyone a fair chance in life. And to look out to the poorest and the neediest, and to build a great society. </p> \n   <p>And on the whole, in the last 200 years, it is we Conservatives who have understood best how to encourage those instincts to work together in harmony, to promote the good of the whole country. </p> \n   <p>And today, at this pivotal moment in our history, we again have to reconcile two sets of instincts, two noble sets of instincts, between the deep desire for friendship and free trade and mutual support in security and defence between Britain and our European partners, and the simultaneous desire \u2013 equally deep and heartfelt \u2013 for democratic self-government in this country.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>What does this mean? Here are two thoughts.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson stressed his desire for a partnership with the EU, not confrontation, in his first public comments as prime minister-elect.</strong> He could have gone for a reprise of his \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/25/brexit-boris-johnson-britain-will-leave-eu-31-october-do-or-die\">Brexit by 31 October, do or die</a>\u201d campaign message, but instead he stressed the importance of having a close and friendly relationship with the EU. That final sentence could have come from a David Cameron speech. This does not necessarily tell you much \u2013 the Tory Brexiters think they have Johnson hostage, and so his room for manoeuvre may be limited \u2013 but it is interesting nonetheless.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson adopted the language of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/18/one-nation-conservatives-launch-declaration-values\">one nation Conservatism</a>, stressing the importance of caring for the \u201cpoorest and the neediest\u201d. </strong>Johnson\u2019s supporters claim that, on all issues other than Brexit, he is at heart a mainstream, one nation Conservative. That is hard to square with his enthusiasm for Brexit and Donald Trump, but it was a common assessment of Johnson when he was London mayor.

Here\u2019s an excerpt.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Almost ironically, without comparing the UK itself with the USSR because it is not comparable, I can\u2019t think of a better golden standard than the USSR in terms of fact distortion, reality falsification and blunt oblivions of reality.</p> \n   <p>Then there were the heroes of the perestroika era swearing that they would create a market economy in post-Soviet Russia within 500 days! \u2018500 Day Programme\u2019 is history. Like the other the most unrealistic promises at the time, this never became a reality. People paid for these empty and broken promises with impoverishment, inequality and much more. The programme also left one infamous quote: \u2018Boris, ti ne prav\u2019 (\u2018Boris, you are wrong\u2019)!</p> \n   <p>It is a different Boris, of course, but there was something in the way of doing politics that was similar: many unrealistic promises, ignoring economic rationales and rational decisions. These decisions led to a new autocratic constitution and finally paved the way to Vladimir Putin. Today in Russia we have oligarchs, a pseudo-market economy, a regulated, governed pseudo-democracy. And, Putin\u2019s authoritarianism. For Boris Yeltsin, the warning came true: \u201cBoris, you are wrong\u201d. Hopefully, it will not be the case for Boris Johnson if he is elected today.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d36e21a8f08d0b6ca536032\" class=\"block\"

          "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from us for this evening. Here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s developments: Boris Johnson will be the UK\u2019s next prime minister after being elected to lead the Conservative party by its membership. Johnson beat his rival, Jeremy Hunt, by 92,153 votes to 46,656. In his victory speech, Johnson stressed his desire for a partnership with the EU. On the campaign trail, he had vowed to leave the bloc \u2013 \u201cdo or die\u201d \u2013 on 31 October. He also attempted to set out a more mainstream, one nation conservative vision for the party. Senior political figures congratulated Johnson on his victory but he was also warned that difficulties lay ahead in his dealings with the EU. The outgoing prime minister, Theresa May, vowed to back him from the back benches but, while EU leaders were careful to be welcoming in their tone, they made clear their longstanding rejection of his Brexit plans remained. The US president, Donald Trump, also congratulated Johnson and claimed the latter\u2019s popularity was linked to his own. Johnson\u2019s domestic rivals were explicit in their disapproval. Labour asked: \u201cHow did our country sink so low?\u201d, though its leader would not say when he would table a motion of no confidence. Jo Swinson, the new Liberal Democrat leader, said Johnson was unfit to be prime minister. The SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, said the \u201cvast majority\u201d of Scottish people would be concerned by his election and Plaid Cymru called it a \u201cgift\u201d to the Welsh independence movement. The incoming prime minister was hit by another ministerial resignation. Anne Milton stepped down as skills minister, saying she had \u201cgrave concerns\u201d about his Brexit stance. But he was given a rapturous welcome by backbench Tory MPs when he addressed them later on Tuesday afternoon. Conservative MPs put on a show for reporters outside the meeting of the 1922 Committee, banging on desks and walls to acclaim their new leader. If you\u2019d like to read yet more, my colleagues Heather Stewart and Jessica Elgot have the full story: Speaking to the LBC radio station, Andrea Leadsom has made it clear she\u2019s angling for a Treasury position, citing her long career experience as evidence of her suitability. There have, of course, been serious questions about the exact nature of that experience. A former ambassador to Denmark and Foreign and Commonwealth Office official is being tipped to be named as Boris Johnson\u2019s new Brexit negotiator, replacing Olly Robbins. David Frost is a career diplomat who was head of Europe at the Foreign Office and served as a special adviser to Boris Johnson during the incoming prime minister\u2019s time there. He is currently the chief executive of the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry and has years of experience working with the EU. Those who know him say he supports Brexit, ticking a key box for the incoming prime minister. \u201cHe believes there is a deal to be done and will pursue that,\u201d one source has said. However, there are also concerns that, if his appointment is confirmed, the key \u201csherpa\u201d role is going to someone who is not a full-time member of the civil service. One source has said: David is good, he knows Europe inside out. But Johnson will need someone at a senior level in the civil service who will be in charge of the day to day work. There has also been speculation Johnson will appoint a Brexiter MP to oversee negotiations in order to satisfy the Eurosceptic MPs who criticised the secrecy of May\u2019s negotiations and the \u201ctunnel\u201d in which Robbins, her Brexit negotiator operated in the latter stages. The Campaign Against Antisemitism is giving Corbyn\u2019s antisemitism plans short shrift. Its chief executive, Gideon Falter, has said: Years too late, Jeremy Corbyn has finally agreed that those who hate Jews should be expelled from the Labour party quickly. What has been lacking all of this time is willpower, not procedures. When the Labour party wants to expel a member, they already have the procedures they need: we have seen lightning-fast action, even against senior party figures, such as Alastair Campbell and Hilary Armstrong, just not for antisemitism. We have no confidence whatsoever in these proposed procedures since it has been so clearly proven that Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s allies and staff have systematically perverted the course of disciplinary processes in order to protect antisemites. Previous rule changes similar to this proved entirely cosmetic because the Labour party is institutionally antisemitic and its internal disciplinary process has been corrupted. Sinn F\u00e9in will work to protect the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, including the commitment to calling a referendum on Irish Unity, the party\u2019s deputy leader Michelle O\u2019Neill has said. The British government has responsibilities and commitments under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement and we will hold them to account. We will continue to stand up for Irish interests, for the majority of citizens in the North who voted on a cross-community basis to remain within the EU. We will continue to work with the Dublin government and the EU27 to protect Ireland from the catastrophic impact of the reckless Brexit being pursued by Boris Johnson and the hard Brexiteers. Labour\u2019s ruling body has accepted Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s plans for dealing with antisemitism complaints. The national executive committee (NEC) agreed to endorse the proposal to allow fast-track expulsions in the most serious cases, a party spokesman has said. It is understood the agreement came after the withdrawal of a motion calling for a fully independent process for dealing with such cases \u2013 an idea backed by the Labour MP Ruth Smeeth among others. There had been criticism of Corbyn\u2019s plan because of the proposed involvement of the party\u2019s general secretary, Jennie Formby, who has been accused of interfering in antisemitism complaints. The spokesman said the proposal would be further developed to enable the NEC to finalise a \u201cfair and legally robust\u201d rule change that could be put to the party\u2019s annual conference in September. The vast majority of Labour members are motivated by equality, justice and fairness, and despise antisemitism. The party is taking decisive and robust action against antisemitism and the rate at which antisemitism cases are dealt with has increased more than four-fold since Jennie Formby became general secretary. Under the proposed changes, the most serious allegations will be referred to a special panel, including Formby and NEC officers. The Financial Times has reported this evening that Johnson has hired the Sky executive, Andrew Griffith, to be his chief business adviser in Downing Street. This comes after Griffith loaned Johnson his \u00a39.5m Westminster townhouse from which to run his campaign. Reacting to the news, the shadow minister for the Cabinet Office, Jon Trickett, has said: Before he is even appointed prime minister, one of Boris Johnson\u2019s first acts is to dish out a powerful job in No 10 to his super-rich pal who lent him his luxurious house in Westminster for the Tory leadership campaign. The public would be forgiven for coming to the conclusion that Johnson\u2019s friends can buy influence within the new administration. It\u2019s blindingly obvious \u2013 Boris Johnson and his government will act only in the interest of the wealthy elite. The Democratic Unionist party MP, Sammy Wilson, has claimed the \u201cproblem along the [Irish] border is an illusionary one\u201d, despite both UK government and EU officials having made clear they believe it to be very real indeed. Asked how he felt Boris Johnson would sort the Irish border issue and whether people were needlessly worried, Wilson said: I think that the Irish border is sorted anyhow, because the problem along the border is an illusionary one ... I think they are worried for no reason. If you look at the Irish border at present, we have to collect taxes across the Irish border every day. And we do that unobtrusively. We have to ensure animal welfare standards are met and animals have to be checked. We do that away from the border. Wilson said illegal trade was stopped by intelligence-led checks and stopping vehicles along country roads. The mechanism for dealing with all of the things that need to be dealt with unobtrusively is already there. Here is some more international reaction to Boris Johnson\u2019s election. From the Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau From the former Danish PM Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen From the Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg That\u2019s all from me for today. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is now taking over. This is from the BBC\u2019s Steve Rosenberg, on how Russian TV is covering this story. Following her muted congratulations statement earlier, the Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson has told BBC Scotland that she will judge Boris Johnson on his actions in office, pointing out that he was not her first choice and that she did not vote for him. She added that he would have to \u201cmake a pretty good fist of it pretty early\u201d because of the challenges he faces. During the interview in Newcastle this afternoon, Davidson reportedly missed a call from Johnson, which she returned. As my colleague Joan E Greve writes on US Politics Live, my Washington equivalent, in his speech to Turning Point USA President Trump also said that Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, who was in the audience, would work well with Boris Johnson. This is from the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Vivian Salama. This is not what Boris Johnson has been saying in the campaign, where he has ruled out electoral pacts with Farage, or giving him a role in the Brexit talks. The Telegraph\u2019s Ben Riley-Smith has the full quote from Donald Trump. This is from CBS\u2019s Mark Knoller. President Trump has got this half right. Boris Johnson is often compared to Trump. But that is because they both have blond hair and say lots of things that are untrue. Outside Tory/Brexit/Telegraph circles, the comparison is not generally viewed as a compliment. This is from Newt Gingrich, the US Republican who was Speaker of the House of Representatives in the late 1990s. Gingrich specialised in hardline, adversarial tactics (his refusal to pass budgets led to several government shutdowns) and he is seen as someone who in some respects paved the way for the politics of Donald Trump. This is probably not the endorsement Boris Johnson wants if he is keen to be seen as a one nation Tory. On a good day to slip out written ministerial statements: the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, has revealed that the cost of the troubled Crossrail programme has risen again. Works on track and stations on the overground section to the west of London, carried out by Network Rail, have run another \u00a3210m over budget since an update in 2018, bringing the total cost to date to more than \u00a317.8bn. Grayling said the cost would be met from internal Network Rail budgets \u2013 although it remains in effect taxpayers\u2019 money as it is a state-owned body. News of the confirmed cost overruns in Network Rail\u2019s relatively small portion of Crossrail work \u2013 now more than 20% over its own allotted \u00a32.3bn Crossrail budget \u2013 will fuel fears aired by the public accounts committee that the delayed rail line could end up costing substantially more yet. Network Rail said the additional time taken to deliver the project was to blame. In an interview with the BBC, the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said that he expected Boris Johnson to make a statement to MPs on Thursday, the final day before the summer recess starts. Corbyn also refused to say when Labour would table a vote of no confidence in Johnson\u2019s government. Asked about this, Corbyn just said Labour would go for a no confidence vote when it was \u201cappropriate to do so\u201d. This is from Ulrike Demmer, deputy spokeswoman from the German government. It says: Chancellor #Merkel on the selection of Boris #Johnson: I congratulate Boris Johnson and am looking forward to good cooperation. Our countries should also be close friends in future. Boris Johnson has now finished speaking to Tory MPs at the 1922 Committee. Here are more tweets about what he said. From my colleague Jessica Elgot From the Evening Standard\u2019s Kate Proctor From the Daily Mail\u2019s John Stevens From Sky\u2019s Aubrey Allegretti From Politico\u2019s Emilio Casalicchio HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh has a better version of the Keith Simpson quote. More on Boris Johnson at the 1922 Committee. Boris Johnson arrived at the 1922 Committee with Sajid Javid, the home secretary, at his side, increasing speculating that Javid could be appointed chancellor tomorrow. This is from my colleague Heather Stewart. But there is also a lot of talk about Liz Truss getting the Treasury. This is from the Evening Standard\u2019s Joe Murphy. It is worth pointing out that the Tory Brexiters are also very happy with the appointment of Mark Spencer as the new chief whip. (See 4.10pm.) This is from the New Statesman\u2019s Patrick Maguire. It quotes Steve Baker, the deputy chairman of the European Research Group, which represents Tories pushing for a harder Brexit. The \u201cSpartans\u201d is the nickname given to the ERG hardliners who refused to give in and vote for Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal. And this is from Stewart Jackson, who was David Davis\u2019s chief of staff when Davis was Brexit secretary. This is from Jean-Claude Juncker, the outgoing president of the European commission. Boris Johnson is now addressing the 1922 Committee. These are from Sky\u2019s Aubrey Allegretti, HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh and my colleague Jessica Elgot. Mark Spencer will be Boris Johnson\u2019s chief whip. Spencer is not exactly well known to the Westminster press corps - there has been a lot of Googling going on this afternoon - but his appointment has been welcomed by MPs from the mainstream of the party. From Sir Nicholas Soames From George Freeman From Caroline Nokes This is from Nick Boles, who was a centrist Tory until he left the party to sit as an independent. And here is some comment on the appointment from journalists. From ITV\u2019s Robert Peston From the Times\u2019 Francis Elliott From the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn YouGov has released some more polling on Boris Johnson, the results of a snap survey conducted in the last few hours. Almost half of voters are either dismayed or disappointed by his election as next PM, the survey suggests. And here is Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, congratulating Boris Johnson on his election. Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel\u2019s long-serving prime minister, has congratulated Boris Johnson. Boris Johnson is shortly to address Tory MPs at the 1922 Committee. This is from Sky\u2019s Aubrey Allegretti. From ITV\u2019s Paul Brand Emmanuel Macron, the French president, has praised Theresa May for not trying to obstruct the workings of the EU, in words that seem aimed at Boris Johnson, the Express\u2019s Joe Barnes reports. The incoming European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, has congratulated Boris Johnson on his election as Tory leader and next PM. \u201cWe have the duty to deliver something which is good for the people of Europe and the United Kingdom,\u201d she told reporters during a visit to France. Scottish Conservatives remain anxious about Boris Johnson\u2019s impact on support for independence, but rather more optimistic after a campaign that gave prominence to the union. After a meeting between Johnson and most of the Scottish Tory MPs at Westminster last week, there is a belief that he is willing to listen to those who know more about the nuances of politics north of the border, and well aware of the importance of this baker\u2019s dozen to parliamentary arithmetic. But Scottish Tory MSPs \u2013 the majority of whom supported Hunt \u2013 believe they will struggle to sell Johnson on the doorstep, given that Ruth Davidson\u2019s electoral success has been based on a modern, anti-elitist version of Conservatism which many (especially the SNP) will argue that Johnson does not represent. Read the full story here. Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, has released this statement about a conversation she had with Boris Johnson after his election as Tory leader and next PM. Foster implies Johnson is planning an early visit to Northern Ireland. She says: I have spoken with Boris Johnson and congratulated him on becoming leader of the Conservative party. We discussed our shared objectives of strengthening every part of the union, ensuring the 2016 referendum result is implemented and seeing devolution restored in Northern Ireland. The confidence and supply agreement between the Conservative party and the Democratic Unionist party remains. That agreement included a review between each parliamentary session. This will take place over the coming weeks and will explore the policy priorities of both parties for the next parliamentary session. I also look forward to welcoming Mr Johnson back to Northern Ireland shortly after becomes prime minister. And, on the subject of Hormuz, this is from Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Javad Zarif. This is from Norbert R\u00f6ttgen, chairman of the foreign affairs committee in the German Bundestag. This is from Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach (prime minister). From my colleague Jessica Elgot YouGov has published some polling showing what people think about having Boris Johnson as prime minister. It suggests he is significantly less popular than Theresa May was when she became prime minister. The polling also suggests that half of voters think Johnson will be poor or terrible as PM, and only one person in five thinks he will be great or good. But YouGov\u2019s Chris Curtis, in his write-up, also suggests these popularity figures may not matter too much. Here\u2019s an extract. Firstly, while his own numbers aren\u2019t good, his opponents\u2019 are generally worse. The 31% who have a favourable view of Johnson is higher than the 27% who have a favourable view of Nigel Farage, the 9% who have a favourable view of Jo Swinson (because most people still haven\u2019t heard of her) and the 18% who have a favourable view of Jeremy Corbyn. In a head-to-head fight against the leader of the opposition over who would make the best prime minister, Boris leads Jeremy Corbyn by 34% to 20% (although they are both behind \u201cnot sure\u201d on 42%). Secondly, whilst Boris\u2019s overall numbers aren\u2019t particularly positive, he does well among the key voters he needs to bring back into the Conservative fold. They key challenge to the Conservative party is to win back the third of their voters that they have lost to the Brexit party over the past few months. And among these voters Boris is incredibly popular, with 71% of those who say they would currently vote for Nigel Farage\u2019s insurgent party saying they have a favourable view of him. In fact, he has about the same levels of popularity amongst Brexit party voters than amongst current Conservatives. Finally, these numbers still have time to change before a general election takes place, and a lot depends on how he handles Brexit over the coming months. This is from Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, on Boris Johnson. I wish Boris Johnson well as prime minister with his \u2018do or die\u2019 pledge to deliver Brexit on October 31. It is \u2018do or die\u2019 not just for Brexit, but for the future of the Conservative party too. Does he have the courage to deliver for the country? Moody\u2019s, the credit rating agency, has issued a report today saying it thinks Boris Johnson\u2019s ascent to become prime minister has made a no-deal Brexit more likely. Here is an extract from its news release. Mr Johnson, who will replace Theresa May as prime minister this week, was a figurehead of the Vote Leave campaign in 2016 and has said he wants the UK to leave the EU by the deadline of 31 October 2019, regardless of whether the EU agrees to a revised deal. \u201cWith the election of Mr Johnson, the likelihood of a sustainable compromise appears lower than before,\u201d said Colin Ellis, Moody\u2019s managing director for credit strategy. \u201cOur view remains that a no-deal Brexit would have significantly negative credit effects for the UK sovereign and related issuers. \u201cSince the outcome of the Brexit referendum, Moody\u2019s central expectation has been that the UK and the EU would reach a withdrawal agreement that preserves many of the features of current trading arrangements, particularly for goods. Although this would be credit-negative compared with staying in the EU, it would be significantly less damaging than a no-deal Brexit. \u201cAlthough a no-deal scenario is now more likely, there is still no majority support in parliament for such an outcome.\u201d Labour has sent an email to supporters about Boris Johnson. Here\u2019s an excerpt. Today, Boris Johnson became leader of the Conservatives. Tomorrow, he\u2019ll be prime minister. How did our country sink so low? Whether you think he\u2019s a scruffy Etonian buffoon or a cold, calculating liar, what\u2019s clear is his terrifying support of a damaging no-deal Brexit and his stunningly out-of-touch policy of tax cuts for the wealthy. We have to stop him. It starts with revealing the real Boris Johnson: out of touch elitist. Untrustworthy. Incompetent. And this is what the party is saying on Twitter. Jeremy Corbyn has issued this statement about Boris Johnson\u2019s election as Tory leader and next PM. After almost a decade of austerity, we need a prime minister on the side of the many, not the few. Boris Johnson has won the support of fewer than 100,000 unrepresentative Conservative party members by promising tax cuts for the richest, presenting himself as the bankers\u2019 best friend, and pushing for a damaging no-deal Brexit. But he hasn\u2019t won the support of our country. Johnson\u2019s no deal would mean job cuts, higher prices in the shops, and risk our NHS being sold off to US corporations in a sweetheart deal with Donald Trump. The people of our country should decide who becomes prime minister. We need a Labour government for the many, not a Boris Johnson Conservative government for the few. Labour is holding a rally in Parliament Square on Thursday demanding a general election. This is from Andrew Fisher, Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s policy adviser. Rory Stewart, the international development secretary, always said he could not serve in cabinet under Boris Johnson because of Johnson\u2019s support for a no-deal Brexit. He has posted a tweet to confirm he will resign tomorrow. Here is my colleague Jessica Elgot\u2019s take on Boris Johnson\u2019s victory speech. Ivanka Trump\u2019s original tweet congratulated Boris Johnson on becoming prime minister of the United Kingston. My colleague Patrick Wintour is disappointed. UPDATE: Here is the original. This is from Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, the president of Turkey. And this is how Google translates Erdo\u011fan\u2019s Turkish. I congratulate @BorisJohnson, the UK\u2019s 77th prime minister, and wish him success in his new role. I believe this develop further the Turkey-United Kingdom relations in the new era. Erdo\u011fan seems willing to forget Johnson\u2019s limerick about him having sex with a goat. By describing Johnson as the 77th prime minister, Erdo\u011fan is using the counting system on the Downing Street website. But this is the figure for the number of times someone has been appointed PM from Sir Robert Walpole onwards, and counts some of them twice, or more than twice. A better figure would be to say Johnson will be the 55th person to serve as prime minister. This is from Philip Hammond, who is going to resign as chancellor tomorrow because he does not want to serve under Boris Johnson. Hammond is in favour of a Brexit deal, but is strongly opposed to leaving the EU without one \u2013 a prospect Johnson is willing to contemplate. From the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg Theresa May says she will give Boris Johnson her \u201cfull support\u201d from the backbenches. From Ivanka Trump, the US president\u2019s daughter This is from Arlene Foster, the DUP leader. Boris Johnson will be the fifth prime minister since the second world war to have been educated at Eton College, the Press Association reports. The other four to attend the independent, fee-paying boarding school were David Cameron (prime minister from 2010-16), Alec Douglas-Home (1963-64), Harold Macmillan (1957-63) and Anthony Eden (1955-57). Like Boris Johnson, all of them were Conservative prime ministers. It means one-third of the UK\u2019s 15 prime ministers since 1945 are Old Etonians \u2013 the name given to former pupils of the college, PA reports. Three other postwar PMs attended independent schools: Clement Attlee (Haileybury), Winston Churchill (Harrow) and Tony Blair (Fettes). The rest, including the outgoing prime minister, Theresa May, attended grammar schools. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, found Boris Johnson\u2019s victory speech (see 12.48pm and 1.28pm) \u201cembarrassingly underwhelming\u201d. From Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Conservative leader A source close to Boris Johnson said cabinet appointments would not be made until Wednesday evening, the Press Association reports. He is expected to spend this afternoon finalising the top ministerial team and preparing his speech for Wednesday. Johnson will also address the 1922 Committee of Conservative MPs at 4pm today and visit CCHQ. This is from Liz Saville Roberts, Plaid Cymru\u2019s leader at Westminster. The Conservative party has just thrown the UK out of the frying pan and into the fire. During the most serious political crisis in decades, a clown is set to become prime minister. But this is no joke. People will soon realise, this isn\u2019t as good as it gets. By electing Boris Johnson, the Conservative party has given the Welsh independence movement a gift. With the election of Mr Johnson, the question of Welsh independence is not of \u2018if\u2019, but \u2018when\u2019. Here is the full text of Boris Johnson\u2019s victory speech. I want to begin by thanking my opponent, Jeremy, by common consent an absolutely formidable campaigner and a great leader and a great politician. Jeremy, in the course of 20 hustings, more, 20 hustings or hustings-style events, it was more than 3,000 miles by the way, it was about 7,000 miles that we did criss-crossing the country, you\u2019ve been friendly, you\u2019ve been good natured, you\u2019ve been a font of excellent ideas, all of which I intend to steal forthwith. And above all I want to thank our outgoing leader, Theresa May for her extraordinary service to this party and to this country. It was a privilege. It was a privilege to serve in her Cabinet and to see the passion and determination that she brought to the many causes that are her legacy - from equal pay for men and women, to tackling the problems of mental health and racial discrimination in the criminal justice system. Thank you, Theresa. Thank you. And I want to thank all of you. All of you here today and obviously I want [to thank] everybody in the Conservative party for your hard work, for your campaigning, for your public spirit and obviously for the extraordinary honour and privilege you have just conferred on me. And I know that there will be people around the place who will question the wisdom of your decision. And there may even be some people here who still wonder quite what they have done. I would just point out to you of course nobody, no one party, no one person has a monopoly of wisdom. But if you look at the history of the last 200 years of this party\u2019s existence you will see that it is we Conservatives who have had the best insights, I think, into human nature. And the best insights into how to manage the jostling sets of instincts in the human heart. And time and again it is to us that the people of this country have turned to get that balance right. Between the instincts to own your own house, your own home, to earn and spend your own money, to look after your own family. Good instincts, proper instincts, noble instincts. And the equally noble instinct to share. And to give everyone a fair chance in life. And to look after the poorest and the neediest and to build a great society. And on the whole in the last 200 years it is we Conservatives who have understood best how to encourage those instincts, to work together in harmony to promote the good of the whole country. And today at this pivotal moment in our history we again have to reconcile two sets of instincts, two noble sets of instincts. Between the deep desire of friendship and free trade and mutual support in security and defence between Britain and our European partners. And the simultaneous desire, equally deep and heartfelt, for democratic self-government in this country. And of course, there are some people who say that they\u2019re irreconcilable and it just can\u2019t be done. And indeed I read in my Financial Times this morning, devoted reader that I am - seriously, it is a great, great, great British brand. I read in my Financial Times this morning that there is no incoming leader, no incoming leader has ever faced such a set of daunting circumstances, it said. Well, I look at you this morning and I ask myself, do you look daunted? Do you feel daunted? I don\u2019t think you look remotely daunted to me. And I think that we know we can do it and that the people of this country are trusting in us to do it and we know that we will do it. And we know the mantra of the campaign that has just gone by, in case you have forgotten it and you probably have, it is deliver Brexit, unite the country and defeat Jeremy Corbyn - and that is what we are going to do. We are all going to defeat Jeremy Corbyn. I know that some wag has already pointed out that deliver, unite and defeat was not the perfect acronym for an election campaign, since unfortunately it spells dud - but they forgot the final \u2018e\u2019 my friends, \u2018e\u2019 for energise. And I say to all the doubters, dude, we are going to energise the country. We are going to get Brexit done on October 31. We are going to take advantage of all the opportunities that it will bring in a new spirit of can-do. And we are once again going to believe in ourselves and what we can achieve. And like some slumbering giant, we are going to rise and ping off the guy ropes of self-doubt and negativity, with better education, better infrastructure, more police, fantastic full-fibre broadband sprouting in every household - we are going to unite this amazing country and we are going to take it forward. I thank you all very much for the incredible honour that you have just done me. I will work flat out from now on with my team that I will build, I hope in the next few days, to repay your confidence, but in the meantime the campaign is over and the work begins. Thank you all very much. Jo Swinson, the new Lib Dem leader, says Boris Johnson is not fit to be PM. And here is Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, on Boris Johnson\u2019s election. Unfortunately Barnier will find that ratifying the withdrawal agreement is not high on Johnson\u2019s list of priorities. Johnson says the withdrawal agreement as it currently exists, with the backstop, is unacceptable. The European parliament\u2019s Brexit steering group will hold a meeting tomorrow with Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, to discuss the implications of Boris Johnson\u2019s election, Guy Verhofstadt, the parliament\u2019s lead Brexit spokesman, says. Tobias Ellwood, the defence minister who has been very critical of the idea of accepting a no-deal Brexit as an acceptable outcome, is not planning to resign, and has urged colleagues to support Boris Johnson. \u201cIt\u2019s a duty of every MP to support the prime minister right now,\u201d he told the Press Association. Boris Johnson has tweeted this message following his election as Tory leader. And Jeremy Hunt has sent this message to the man who beat him. Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, says she has \u201cprofound concerns\u201d about Boris Johnson\u2019s election, and demands that he take the threat of a no-deal Brexit off the table immediately. I congratulate Boris Johnson on his election as Tory leader and I will do everything possible to ensure that he respects Scotland\u2019s views and interests. However, I have profound concerns about the prospect of his premiership and it would be hypocritical not to be frank about these. These are concerns that I am certain will be shared by the vast majority of people in Scotland who, had they been given any say, would not have chosen to hand the keys of No 10 to someone with his views and track record. Brexit of any kind would be deeply damaging to Scotland and the rest of the UK, but his public pledge to leave the EU by 31 October \u2013 \u2018come what may\u2019 and \u2018do or die\u2019 \u2013 flies in the face of logic, common sense or any basic regard for the wellbeing of the people and nations of the UK. It is a deeply irresponsible threat, and not one that should be contemplated by any serious political leader. It should now be taken off the table without delay or equivocation. Sturgeon pledged that her Scottish government would be \u201cat the forefront of all and any moves to stop Brexit and block a no-deal Brexit, as will SNP MPs in the House of Commons\u201d, adding that these efforts were supported across the political spectrum. Theresa May has chaired her last cabinet, and from the sound of things it was a very much an end-of-term affair, focused on praising her record and then handing over parting gifts. The meeting discussed funding for the NHS and how to tackle May\u2019s much-mentioned \u201cburning injustices\u201d, such as access to mental health treatment, her spokesman said, and generally agreed that she had done a great job on housebuilding, employment and the economy. \u201cThe PM thanked the cabinet for all they had done during her premiership, which she said had done much to improve people\u2019s lives,\u201d her spokesman said. She also thanked No 10 advisers and the civil service. Then May\u2019s de facto deputy, David Lidington, thanked her \u201cfor her great dedicated to public service, and her commitment to the union\u201d, the spokesman said. Finally, it was over to Michael Gove, the environment secretary, who handed over presents paid for by a cabinet whip-round \u2013 a black Liberty handbag and a crystal necklace by the French company Lalique. May\u2019s spokesman was pressed on precisely what bag it was, and gamely spent some time looking at the Liberty website on his phone to see if he could recognise it, but that detail will have to come later. Outside the Queen Elizabeth II centre in Westminster, about 100 pro-Brexit and pro-EU protesters were gathered alongside members of the press waiting for the future prime minister to emerge from the building. Some campaigners shouted: \u201cBollocks to Brexit\u201d and \u201cYou can shove your Brexit up Farage\u201d while waving EU flags. Others were holding: \u201cWe voted leave\u201d placards over the temporary barriers outside the centre. Ruth Bradshaw, 76, who lives in London, was among the pro-EU demonstrators disappointed by the news of Boris Johnson\u2019s victory. \u201cI\u2019m here to stop Brexit,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m very displeased by the news Boris will be the next PM, but I have to say I\u2019m not shocked. I think of the two remaining candidates, the one with more common sense was Mr Hunt \u2013 who was prepared to extend the deadline after Halloween.\u201d President Trump has congratulated Boris Johnson. Boris Johnson\u2019s speech was very short, and probably a disappointment to anyone expecting some trademark Johnson jokes. It was also rather thin for someone who has spent the last four weeks certain almost beyond doubt that they would become the next prime minister. But Johnson will be giving a speech in Downing Street tomorrow, which will receive more attention, he is expected to make a statement to MPs on Thursday, and he is scheduled to give a major speech at the end of this week. Now was not really the time for a major statement of intent. Still, in an extract buried in the middle of the speech, there were two clues as to where he intends to go. Here is key passage. If you look at the history of the last 200 years of this party\u2019s existence, you will see that it is we Conservatives who have had the best insights, I think, into human nature, and the best insights into how to manage the jostling sets of instincts in the human heart. And time again it is to us that the people of this country have turned to get that balance right, between the instincts to own your own home, to earn and spend your own money, to look after your own family \u2013 good instincts, proper instincts, noble instincts \u2013 and the equally noble instinct to share and to give everyone a fair chance in life. And to look out to the poorest and the neediest, and to build a great society. And on the whole, in the last 200 years, it is we Conservatives who have understood best how to encourage those instincts to work together in harmony, to promote the good of the whole country. And today, at this pivotal moment in our history, we again have to reconcile two sets of instincts, two noble sets of instincts, between the deep desire for friendship and free trade and mutual support in security and defence between Britain and our European partners, and the simultaneous desire \u2013 equally deep and heartfelt \u2013 for democratic self-government in this country. What does this mean? Here are two thoughts. Johnson stressed his desire for a partnership with the EU, not confrontation, in his first public comments as prime minister-elect. He could have gone for a reprise of his \u201cBrexit by 31 October, do or die\u201d campaign message, but instead he stressed the importance of having a close and friendly relationship with the EU. That final sentence could have come from a David Cameron speech. This does not necessarily tell you much \u2013 the Tory Brexiters think they have Johnson hostage, and so his room for manoeuvre may be limited \u2013 but it is interesting nonetheless. Johnson adopted the language of one nation Conservatism, stressing the importance of caring for the \u201cpoorest and the neediest\u201d. Johnson\u2019s supporters claim that, on all issues other than Brexit, he is at heart a mainstream, one nation Conservative. That is hard to square with his enthusiasm for Brexit and Donald Trump, but it was a common assessment of Johnson when he was London mayor. The real question, perhaps, is whether one nation Conservatism is compatible with hardline Brexitism (which takes you towards Nigel Farage-style nativism), but it is worth noting that Johnson still wants to use this language. Boris Johnson received 66% of the vote, on an 87% turnout. In percentage terms, that is better than Jeremy Corbyn achieved in the last Labour leadership election, in 2016, when he got 62% of the vote on a 78% turnout (although the electorate in that contest was much larger). It is also better than Jo Swinson achieved yesterday, when she was elected Lib Dem leader with 63% of the vote on a 72% turnout. Johnson has also done better than Iain Duncan Smith, the first Conservative leader elected by members, not just MPs. In 2001 Duncan Smith got 61% of the vote on a 78% turnout. But Johnson has not managed to beat his old rival, David Cameron. Cameron had 68% of the vote when he won in 2005, on a turnout that was also 78%. He says his three priorities \u2013 deliver, unite and defeat \u2013 form the acronym Dud. But that is to leave out the final plan: \u201cenergise\u201d. So his acronym is Dude, he jokes. He says he is now going to get on with the job. And that\u2019s it. Boris Johnson says the party has to reconcile two conflicting instincts again: the instinct to work with others, and the instinct for self-government. He says in the Financial Times this morning someone said no incoming leader had ever faced such a daunting set of circumstances. But do you look daunted, he asks the audience. They don\u2019t look or feel daunted he says. He says the mantra of his campaign was to deliver Brexit, unite the country and defeat Jeremy Corbyn. (He used to include unite the party too, but with all the resignations, that might not have sounded such a good line.) Boris Johnson says there will be people who question the wisdom of the decision to elect him. No one person or party has a monopoly of wisdom, he says. But he says over time the Conservatives have had the best instincts, and the best way of balancing instincts, like the instinct to own your own home and keep your own money, and the instinct to share. The Conservatives have encouraged those instincts to work together, he says. Boris Johnson is giving his victory speech. He starts by saying Jeremy Hunt was a formidable opponent. He was a fount of excellent ideas, all of which Johnson says he proposes to steal forthwith. And he thanks Theresa May for her service. Boris Johnson won with 66% of the vote. Gillan said there were 159,320 people eligible to vote. Turnout was 87.4%. And there were 509 rejected ballot papers. Gillan is now announcing the results. Boris Johnson: 92,153 Jeremy Hunt: 46,656 Dame Cheryl Gillan is explaining the election process. She also thanks party staff, and the party\u2019s board. And she thanks the ERS for conducting a professional election. And she thanks the 1922 executive too. She also thanks everyone who voted in the election, and the candidates who stood. Both Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt emerged as worthy candidates, she said. Dame Cheryl Gillan and Charles Walker from the 1922 Committee come on stage to announce the results. Walker thanks the party staff. He says he has a plea as a backbencher. Can we be kinder to the next prime minister than we have been to the current prime minister? Lewis invites Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt into the hall. Lewis thanks Theresa May for her service. It is now paramount that they come together, he says. He says the party will deliver best for the country when it is united. Lewis says Tory members have undertaken a solemn duty in choosing the next leader. They have engaged constructively and thoughtfully in the process. He says he thinks the party has risen to the task. Brandon Lewis, the party chairman, is speaking now. He says he is proud of the way the election has been conducted. The candidates have travelled the country and taken hundreds of questions. He says the online live hustings, open to everyone in the country, was a first for a political party. He thanks party staff for their work. Now we\u2019ve got a clip from John Major \u2013 but not the statement about the dangers of a no-deal Brexit he made yesterday. David Cameron and Theresa May have also been featured. Now an extract from Margaret Thatcher\u2019s final speech in the Commons. At the QEII centre some audio is now being played. It is Winston Churchill, followed by Harold Macmillan (I think) talking about how great it is to be made prime minister. Then Margaret Thatcher\u2019s \u201cYou turn if you want to, the lady\u2019s not for turning\u201d soundbite. The announcement seems imminent. Here is Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, checking his watch. As are many people. The event is running late. From my colleague Daniel Boffey in Brussels Here is Jeremy Hunt and his wife Lucia arriving at the QEII centre a few minutes ago. This is from Arlene Foster, the DUP leader. From BuzzFeed\u2019s Matthew Champion From the Mail on Sunday\u2019s Harry Cole Mark Spencer is currently a whip. From the Daily Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar In an extraordinary blog Vytenis Andriukaitis, the European commissioner for health and food safety, who is from Lithuania, suggests that Boris Johnson and his fellow Brexiters are just as dishonest as Boris Yeltsin and other politicians were in post-Soviet Russia. Here\u2019s an excerpt. Almost ironically, without comparing the UK itself with the USSR because it is not comparable, I can\u2019t think of a better golden standard than the USSR in terms of fact distortion, reality falsification and blunt oblivions of reality. Then there were the heroes of the perestroika era swearing that they would create a market economy in post-Soviet Russia within 500 days! \u2018500 Day Programme\u2019 is history. Like the other the most unrealistic promises at the time, this never became a reality. People paid for these empty and broken promises with impoverishment, inequality and much more. The programme also left one infamous quote: \u2018Boris, ti ne prav\u2019 (\u2018Boris, you are wrong\u2019)! It is a different Boris, of course, but there was something in the way of doing politics that was similar: many unrealistic promises, ignoring economic rationales and rational decisions. These decisions led to a new autocratic constitution and finally paved the way to Vladimir Putin. Today in Russia we have oligarchs, a pseudo-market economy, a regulated, governed pseudo-democracy. And, Putin\u2019s authoritarianism. For Boris Yeltsin, the warning came true: \u201cBoris, you are wrong\u201d. Hopefully, it will not be the case for Boris Johnson if he is elected today. The cabinet bought Theresa May a handbag and some jewellery as a leaving present, the Times\u2019 Steven Swinford reports. From the Independent\u2019s Andrew Woodcock This is from my colleague Heather Stewart, who is at the QEII centre. Here are some other senior Tories arriving at the QEII centre. Boris Johnson is arriving at the QEII centre shortly. This is from Anna Soubry, the former Tory MP who now leads the Independent Group for Change. Anne Milton has resigned as skills minister, saying she has \u201cgrave concerns\u201d about the prospect of leaving the EU without a deal (something that Boris Johnson says ministers must accept as an option if they want to serve in his cabinet). She also points out that she abstained last week (ie defying the government whip, which was to vote against) when MPs backed a move intended to stop Boris Johnson proroguing parliament to facilitate a no-deal Brexit. Downing Street has just announced that the Labour MP John Mann has been appointed to the government as an independent adviser to the government on antisemitism. Mann, a Brexiter who has been critical of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership of Labour, chairs the all-party parliamentary group against antisemitism. He will provide advice to the the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG). Commenting on the appointment, Theresa May said: Antisemitism is racism. It has absolutely no place in our society and we must fight its bitter scourge wherever it rears its head. I\u2019ve been proud to lead a government that is tackling such discrimination in all its forms \u2013 from making sure courts have the powers they need to deal with those who peddle hatred, to asking the Law Commission to undertake a full review of hate crime legislation. But there is yet more to do. John Mann is, without exception, a key voice on this matter. He has frequently campaigned in the House of Commons on this issue and has tirelessly used his role as a politician to speak out on behalf of victims of anti-Jewish racism. I am confident he will bring the level of cross-party independent advice needed to advise government and to ensure we see progress on this very important issue. Sky\u2019s Sam Coates has the timetable for the announcement. We will have a live feed at the top of the blog. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over Nadeem Badshah. Sorry not to be in earlier. I was held up at home. Here is video of Boris Johnson\u2019s brother Jo and father Stanley arriving at the QEII centre in Westminster for the announcement of the results of the Tory leadership contest. Nigel Evans, the Conservative backbench MP, told the BBC: The only thing that\u2019s certain is that Larry the Cat is going to stay in place as the Downing Street cat. Prime ministers come and go, Larry remains in place. When asked if he believes Boris Johnson could be persuaded that a third runway should be built at Heathrow, the airport\u2019s chief executive John Holland-Kaye told the PA news agency: It\u2019s actually a fait accompli now. The vote in parliament with nearly a four-to-one majority means this is now happening. The judicial review process was a resounding success for the Department for Transport at the first stage, so this is now a reality and things have moved on. We\u2019re now making it happen. There are jobs now that we have created up and down the country that would be at risk if anything else was to happen, and hundreds of thousands more that we\u2019ll create as we expand. So I don\u2019t think any prime minister would not want to see the benefits that come with Heathrow expansion. The new Conservative leader will be announced at the QEII centre in London at around 11:45am with campaigners for a People\u2019s Vote protesting outside the venue in Westminster. New Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson says her door is open to members of rival parties who want to join her and the prospect of a Boris Johnson-led Conservative Party pushing for a no-deal Brexit could increase the chances of a second referendum. She said she was involved in talks with MPs from other parties, including the Conservatives, about defecting. \u201cOur door is absolutely open to people who share our values,\u201d Swinson, who was appointed Lib Dem leader yesterday, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. I am talking to people in different parties, including Conservatives. There is a reason why thousands of people are joining the Liberal Democrats, when the Conservatives have gone off to the right and Labour have gone off to the left and people who want to see a better politics, a better alternative than the - frankly depressing - choice of Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn, they can join us because there is a better way. She admitted there might not yet be a majority in parliament for a so-called people\u2019s vote on Brexit but the numbers in favour of another referendum would be bolstered by disaffected Tories under Johnson. When asked if he would serve under Boris Johnson, international development secretary Rory Stewart replied: \u201cNo.\u201d Stewart is among the ministers who have arrived at Number 10 along with Matt Hancock, Jeremy Hunt, Liz Truss, Karen Bradley and Jeremy Wright for a cabinet meeting. It will be Theresa May\u2019s final cabinet meeting as prime minister. Green MEP Philippe Lamberts, a member of the European Parliament\u2019s Brexit steering group, said if Boris Johnson wins the Tory leadership race he \u201cwill be confronting the exact same situation as Theresa May\u201d. The Belgian MEP told the Today programme: Boris Johnson is known to want many things and often contradictory things like having your cake and eating it, he is on record saying that. So indeed he wants good relations with the European Union and he wants to be able to cut off all ties and not have the Irish backstop and all the rest of it. He suggested Johnson should seek to pass a Brexit deal with a Northern Ireland-only backstop, something which would lose the support of the DUP but could pick up support from elsewhere in the Commons. Former defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon has claimed Boris Johnson\u2019s optimism and fresh mandate would help shift Brussels towards a deal. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: Nobody is aiming for no-deal, that is not the strategy. We want a better deal, parliament wants a better deal, and Boris Johnson has made clear throughout that he wants a better deal. But the way to get a better deal is to be very firm that that date is there in law. There are three months now before the end of October and it is perfectly possible, with plenty of goodwill on both sides, to improve the agreement so that parliament does, in the end, support it. Justice secretary David Gauke, who said on Sunday he would not serve in Cabinet under Boris Johnson, believes there were \u201cparliamentary mechanisms\u201d which could prevent a no-deal Brexit. That would \u201cnot necessarily\u201d involve bringing down a Johnson administration, he said. Gauke stressed that he would not vote against a Tory government in a motion of no confidence if it was heading towards a no-deal Brexit, but does not think \u201cit will come to that.\u201d He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: I think that there will be parliamentary mechanisms, if you like. There is a clear majority in the House of Commons that doesn\u2019t want to leave the EU without a deal, I think that will become very clear in the autumn. He added there was the possibility of a \u201cperiod of huge uncertainty\u201d in Westminster as the October 31 deadline approaches. Are there circumstances where there is a risk of a government losing a confidence motion? Yes, clearly there are circumstances where there is a risk that that might happen. I think that the new prime minister would be wise to avoid getting into those circumstances. The outcome of the ballot of about 160,000 Tory members will be revealed at just before midday in London with the victor officially becoming prime minister on Wednesday. Jeremy Hunt was in a positive mood when he arrived home from a run this morning despite Boris Johnson remaining the clear favourite to take over from Theresa May. The foreign secretary said it was still \u201call to play for\u201d, a comment echoed by his rival as he entered his campaign headquarters. A Johnson win could spark more government resignations after Sir Alan Duncan quit as Foreign Office minister on Monday in protest at his expected victory, predicting a \u201ccrisis of government\u201d. Chancellor Philip Hammond and justice secretary David Gauke have given notice that they will resign rather than serve under Johnson. Moving away from the white smoke to confirm the next prime minister, Ruth Smeeth, parliamentary chairwoman of the Jewish Labour Movement, has called for a completely independent process for dealing with anti-Semitism cases in the party. The MP told the Today programme: The proposals that were sanctioned by the shadow cabinet and will be discussed today at the NEC just simply aren\u2019t good enough. There is still no independence, in fact arguably political power over anti-Semitism cases is going to be consolidated by political supporters of Jeremy Corbyn. I think we need a completely independent process that could restore faith for everybody. Boris Johnson entered his campaign headquarters in Westminster at around 8am. Asked if he agreed with his rival Jeremy Hunt that it was still all to play for, he said: \u201cAll to play for.\u201d Good morning. There is a momentous day ahead with Boris Johnson expected to be announced as the choice of the Conservative party to be the next prime minister. Theresa May is set to chair her final cabinet meeting as prime minister. At around 4pm, Gina Miller, Sir John Curtice and Henry Newman are scheduled give evidence on the impact of a no-deal Brexit to the Lords EU Committee",

In a joint press conference at the Capitol, the congresswomen spoke out after Trump said they should \u201cgo back\u201d to the \u201ccrime infested\u201d countries they came from, prompting condemnation in the US and across the world. Of the four, all are non-white and all except Ilhan Omar of Minnesota were born US citizens. Omar came to the US aged 12 as a refugee and took up American citizenship five years later. All are progressives within the Democratic party, and advocate for left-leaning policies. The women \u2013 Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts \u2013 called Trump\u2019s remarks a \u201cblatantly racist\u201d attack on elected leaders, and an attempt to distract from the corrupt and inhuman practices of his administration. \u201cThis is a disruptive distraction from the issues of care, concern and consequence to the American people that we were sent here with a decisive mandate from our constituents to work on,\u201d said Pressley, who was the first black woman elected to Congress from Massachusetts. \u201cThis is the agenda of white nationalists, whether it is happening in chat rooms, or it is happening on national TV, and now it is reached the White House garden,\u201d said Omar, who called this a \u201cpivotal moment in our country \u201c with the \u201ceyes of history\u201d watching. Listing vulgar comments Trump has made publicly and privately about women, people of color and African nations, Omar said he has \u201copenly violated the oath he took\u201d by allowing \u201chuman rights abuses\u201d at the US-Mexico border and of colluding with a foreign government during the 2016 presidential election, which Trump has denied. \u201cIt is time for us to stop allowing this president to make a mockery of our constitution,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is time to impeach this president.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez, who was born in the Bronx and is of Puerto Rican descent, said she was \u201cnot surprised\u201d by Trump\u2019s comments. \u201cThis president \u2026 does not know how to defend his policies and so what he does is attack us personally,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said. Tlaib, the Detroit-born daughter of Palestinian immigrants, renewed her calls for Trump to be impeached for his \u201cutter disregard and disrespect of the United States constitution\u201d. \u201cSadly, this is not the first nor will it be the last time we hear disgusting, bigoted language from the president,\u201d Tlaib said. \u201cWe know this is who he is.\u201d But she stressed that she would continue to stay focused on the priorities that she believes her constituents want her to address, including the conditions at the US border, poverty in America and the expansion of access to healthcare. As the four women were speaking, Trump was live-tweeting his own caustic commentary. He implied that his provocative stance had forced the Democrats to embrace the congresswomen which in turn meant \u201cthey are endorsing Socialism, hate of Israel and the USA!

In them, the US president interjected himself uninvited into the middle of an argument that had been developing between the four progressive members of Congress and Nancy Pelosi, the most powerful Democrat on Capitol Hill. In his Twitter storm, Trump called on the four \u2013 who he did not name directly but clearly invoked \u2013 to \u201cgo back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came\u201d. The president\u2019s use of the \u201cgo back home\u201d racist trope led to an immediate and explosive response, with condemnation erupting across the US and around the world. Race-baiting has been a consistent theme of Trump\u2019s presidency \u2013 starting on the day he announced his presidential run in June 2015 when he accused Mexico of sending \u201crapists\u201d to the US as immigrants. Pelosi made clear her deep displeasure that Trump had chosen to interfere in her party\u2019s internal affairs in such poisonous terms, denouncing his comments as another manifestation of his desire to make \u201cAmerica white again\u201d. Pelosi announced on Monday that the House would move to formally condemn the president\u2019s \u201cxenophobic\u201d tweets about members of Congress with resolution. A number of Democratic candidates in the 2020 presidential race piled in. Joe Biden, the former vice-president who currently leads the Democratic field, slammed into Trump for continuing to \u201cspew hateful rhetoric, sow division, and stoke racial tensions for his own political gain\u201d.

He appeared only to be further energized by the global pounding he received, enthusiastically hurling himself at the dispute. In an indication of the divisive, us-against-them tactics Trump will run on in 2020, his re-election campaign seized on a comment by Omar to suggest that she was refusing to denounce the terrorist organization al-Qaida. Over the course of Monday Trump refused to back down \u2013 flinging the opprobrium he had come under over the previous 24 hours back in the faces of his critics. \u201cWhen will the Radical Left Congresswomen apologize to our country \u2026 for the foul language they have used, and the terrible things they have said,\u201d he tweeted.

          "bodyText": "Donald Trump\u2019s unusual claim during his Fourth of July speech that the US revolutionary army of 1775 \u201ctook over airports\u201d from the British a full 128 years ahead of the Wright brothers\u2019 first flight has spurred a slew of memes. By late Thursday evening, #RevolutionaryWarAirportStories was trending on Twitter, mockingly inserting themes from the perils of modern air travel with anecdotes from the revolutionary war. During his tribute to the army, the president said: \u201cOur army manned the air, it rammed the ramparts, it took over the airports, it did everything it had to do, and at Fort McHenry, under the rockets\u2019 red glare, it had nothing but victory.\u201d The statement prompted Twitter user Shawna to riff on the theme of lost luggage: Historian Seth Cotlar, who teaches US history at Willamette University, spun the tale of the airports into old English. LionO*s_Jungle wondered if George Washington could board an aircraft with his horse as an emotional support animal. Above an image of the famously tight-lipped George Washington, Twitter user Damian Ayers wrote: \u201cWhen you find out your flight has been cancelled due to bad weather and you and the Continental Army have to spend time in Valley Forge.\u201d Another imagined redcoats not so much as British soldiers of the 18th century and more as Virgin Atlantic cabin staff. Some uncovered new battles, such as the Battle of the Baggage Claim. And some imagined what modern security staff would have made of trying to search revolutionary war generals. Trump isn\u2019t the only member of his family taken to task recently on Twitter. First daughter Ivanka Trump\u2019s contributions to a conversation were apparently ignored by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, British prime minister, Theresa May, Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, and International Monetary Fund leader, Christine Lagarde, at the recent G20 meeting in Osaka, Japan. The moment produced some world-class Twitter memes under the #UnwantedIvanka hashtag. They include Ivanka Trump being left out of the drama as Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet sink on the Titanic, being left out of the 1969 moon landing, and crossing Abbey Road with the Beatles.",

Sounds of summer The capital reverberates to music all summer long. Bluesfest is the biggest and boldest festival of the summer and boasts much more than just blues. Headliners this year include the Killers, Alt-J, Wu-Tang Clan and the Backstreet Boys. But from June through to September there really is something for everyone: Escapade sates all EDM lovers\u2019 appetites; Chamberfest is the world\u2019s biggest chamber music festival; there are five days of fireworks at the Canadian Museum of History with the Sound of Light competition and, yes, there is also a 10-day jazz festival that features some of the world\u2019s biggest acts. Please the palate at a walking pace Ottawa\u2019s food scene \u2013 a melting pot that bubbles over with flavours and aromas \u2013 is as diverse as its population. The city ranges from award-winning fine dining to adventurous ethnic holes in the wall, with plenty in between. But there are so many funky new places opening up that wrangling them all in can seem like a challenge. So why not pass the job off to someone else by joining a walking food tour? C\u2019est Bon Cooking offers great guides to the city\u2019s food culture, snaking through the top foodie neighbourhoods. Centretown and The Glebe might be the most happening neighbourhoods right now. Waterways to pass the day If the blue lagoon part of the Goliath sounds appealing, but little else, then keep things upright and a little lower on the adrenaline scale by hitting the waterways that course around the city. With temperatures on the rise, the summer months in Ottawa are made for water lovers. You can take to the Rideau canal in your own personal vessel, with kayak, paddleboat, canoe and stand-up paddleboard (SUP) rentals all available at the marina at Dow\u2019s Lake. Venture beyond the canal to either the Ottawa or Gatineau rivers. Urban Ocean may be the pick of some great rental and guide firms, offering the chance to SUP in the shadows of Parliament Hill or SUP yoga by the Ottawa locks. Live the high life \u2026 then drop Not everything has to be chill in Ottawa \u2013 there are thrills too. Nowhere does the adrenaline flow freer and faster than at the Rock. Just a 20-minute drive from downtown, this stunning limestone gorge is a site to behold but looks even better upside down. Great Canadian Bungee offers the highest fall on the continent of North America \u2014 fully 61 metres (200 feet) into the aquamarine lagoon below. Even the 49-metre (160-foot) rebound is higher than the next biggest bungee in the US or Canada! If you\u2019re not feeling the urge, watching others drop below is a thrill in itself! Culture cravings satisfied Ottawa is not just the country\u2019s political centre. It lays claim to being Canada\u2019s museum and gallery capital too. The sprawling National Gallery of Canada finds room for almost 100,000 works, by a distance the country\u2019s biggest. This summer\u2019s highlight sees the world\u2019s first-ever exhibition devoted to the portrait work of post-impressionist master Paul Gauguin. But make time for the Canadian and Indigenous galleries too, where the country\u2019s cultural heritage can be traced back 5,000 years. At the Ottawa Art Gallery\u2019s stunning new home \u2013 shared with Le Germain hotel \u2013 catch the Wrapped in Culture project, a powerful reclamation project between Indigenous artists from Canada and Australia. Go wild So many summer visitors eschew Canadian cities and make straight for the great wilderness. Ottawa offers the best of both worlds. Drive even 10 minutes outside the city and you\u2019ll find your natural paradise. Gatineau Park is over 350 sq kms of green goodness and yet its main entrance is just 4km from downtown. Hike to the Pink Lake lookout where the deepest aqua-green waters ensure that no filter is required for the perfect selfie. There are trails for all levels of hikers, and rookies and experts alike should finish up at the genteel 1900s surrounds of the Mackenzie King Estate, where tea and scones at the former residence of Canada\u2019s longest-serving prime minister are just reward for the hike.

Larry Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota, said: \u201cThe fact that Trump would let his own daughter, who has no training and no basis for participating in diplomatic events, [go to the G20] epitomises the Trump administration\u2019s amateurish approach to foreign policy. \u201cHe\u2019s very obviously thumbing his nose at protocol and decades of norms.\u201d The Trump family business has drawn comparisons to a constitutional monarchy. Trump told the Atlantic earlier this year: \u201cIf [Ivanka] ever wanted to run for president. I think she\u2019d be very, very hard to beat.\u201d Ivanka\u2019s brothers, Donald Jr and Eric, have become outspoken defenders of their father and are set to play leading roles in the 2020 election. Jordan Libowitz, communications director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics (Crew) in Washington, said: \u201cIt is questionable what Ivanka Trump was doing at the G20 summit, but it is also questionable what she does in the White House. \u201cShe takes a very prominent public role without defined duties or qualifications further than being the president\u2019s daughter. \u201cMore troubling is the fact that she continues to own significant problematic assets, from which she makes millions of dollars \u2013 including a share of the Trump hotel in Washington, which has become a haven for people looking to influence the Trump administration.\u201d",

          "bodyText": "Time for a recap. World leaders have gathered in Osaka, Japan, ahead of a likely storm G20 meeting dominated by trade disputes. Donald Trump, Xi Jinping, Shinzo Abe, Theresa May, Justin Trudeau, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, Giuseppe Conte and Pedro S\u00e1nchez, and more, have braved the wet and windy airfield at Osaka, for a crunch summit. Trump set the tone for the G20, via Twitter, by demanding that India withdraw new tariffs on US goods --- even though they were imposed in response to his own tariffs on India. Trump has also warned he could impose tariffs on all Chinese imports - an extra $325bn or so - if he isn\u2019t satisfied with Beijing\u2019s actions on trade. His economic advisor, Larry Kudlow, has echoed that claim today. He\u2019s also cast doubt on America\u2019s commitment to defending Japan -- causing another pillar in the world order to wobble slightly.... Financial markets will be watching the G20 meeting closely, hoping for progress in the trade disputes that have slowed global growth in recent months. China has reportedly drawn up a list of conditions to present the US, when Trump and Xi dine on Saturday night. They include ending the blacklisting of Huawei. Trump is also due to meet Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan during a busy schedule. The meeting with Erdo\u011fan is likely to be particularly fiery, given US concerns that Turkey is buying an anti-aircraft system from Russia. The climate emergency will also be on the agenda. May has told us that she\u2019ll be raising the issue with other world leaders, having recognised the impact of climate change. The G20 begins Friday morning Osaka time, or around midnight in the UK / early evening on the East Coast, so stay tuned to our website for more news. GW Investors around the globe are trying to square the White House\u2019s \u2018good-cop\u2019/\u2019bad-cop\u2019 commentary on the trade war with China, says analyst Ken Odeluga of City Index. Trump\u2019s \u201cPlan B\u201d is to \u201ctake in billions and billions of dollars a month\u201d more from China while doing \u201cless and less business\u201d with the second-largest economy. His Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin remained \u201chopeful\u201d on Wednesday. Other Washington hawks bat away Beijing\u2019s insistence on a \u2018balanced\u2019 deal. Little wonder that ample dissonance accompanies the wide expectation that a tariff ceasefire will be agreed this weekend. European stock markets have closed after a day of subdued trading. The Stoxx 600 index, which covers Europe\u2019s biggest companies, ended the day basically unchanged. Investors are hunkering down ahead of the formal start of the G20 summit on Friday. Healthcare and some consumer goods makers rallied, matching gains in America. That\u2019s because only two Democratic challengers to become the next US president backed the idea of replacing private health insurance with \u201cMedicare for All\u201d. Heads-up: One of Donald Trump\u2019s top advisors has warned that America could press on and raise tariffs on Chinese imports. Larry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council, has said America is insisting on \u2018structural changes\u2019 to China\u2019s intellectual property laws, with effective enforcement for any breaches. He told Fox News: \u201cIf need be, we may move ahead \u2013 we may move ahead on additional tariffs. However, Kudlow also claimed America hasn\u2019t set any \u2018preconditions\u2019 ahead of the Trump-Xi meeting on Saturday. This G20 summit is Theresa May\u2019s last big foreign trip before stepping down as PM. She\u2019s expected to hold meeting with Australian PM Scott Morrison, Turkey\u2019s Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, South Africa\u2019s Cyril Ramaphosa and Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman. Lots to discuss with that group! May\u2019s spokeswoman says she will raise the death of Jamal Khashoggi with MBS, and also press him on the need to de-escalate tensions with Iran. The UK court ruling that Britain\u2019s arms sales to Saudi Arabia are unlawful will probably also come up. The leaders of China and Japan, Xi Jinping and Shinzo Abe, have held a meeting in Osaka ahead of the G20 meeting. Although the handshake doesn\u2019t look too chummy, there are signs that relations may be warming. Abe told Xi that he hopes to welcome him to Japan soon: Around the time of the cherry blossoms next spring, I would like to welcome President Xi as a state guest to Japan, and hope to further elevate ties between Japan and China to the next level. In another hotel suite, Ivanka Trump and husband Jared Kushner appeared to enjoy dinner with Australian PM Scott Morrison: During the dinner, president Trump congratulated Scott Morrison on his \u201ctremendous victory\u201d at the Australian federal election. Trump declared he\u2019d expected it all along.... \u201cHe didn\u2019t surprise me but he surprised a lot of other people. \u201cSee, I knew him. See, I said you\u2019re going to do very well, and he did, he did that. \u201cThey called it an upset but I don\u2019t call it an upset ... I want to congratulate you very much, it was a fantastic thing.\u201d Morrison\u2019s critics don\u2019t share Trump\u2019s enthusiasm, I fear, after the Australian PM announced plans to cut regulations - on top of planned tax cuts. All very Trumpian.... World leaders have continued to arrive in Osaka - including the heads of Italy and Spain. Big news in the UK car sector -- Vauxhall\u2019s Ellesmere Port plant in the North West of England has won the chance to manufacture its new Astra vehicle. That\u2019s a big win for the plant, which employs 1,100 people, and has beaten off competition from a rival plant in Gliwice, Poland. BUT there\u2019s a catch... the plan is conditional on the terms of Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union. That suggests that a no-deal Brexit would scupper the plan. Vauxhall\u2019s owner, PSA, says: The decision on the allocation to the Ellesmere Port plant will be conditional on the final terms of the UK\u2019s exit from the European Union and the acceptance of the New Vehicle Agreement, which has been negotiated with the Unite Trade Union. PSA has also decided to manufacture the new Astra at its factory in Russelsheim, Germany. Motoring journalist Richard Aucock says it\u2019s a real boost for the UK auto industry. Donald Trump is due to hold meetings with a series of world leaders at the G20 summit -- including several fellow \u2018strong men\u2019. Top of the list is president Xi Jinping. If the WSJ is right, Xi will urge Trump to accept China\u2019s proposals to pause the trade war and resume talks. The success, or otherwise, of those talks will swiftly move the financial markets. Trump will also speak with Vladimir Putin - the first face-to-face meeting since the Mueller investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election concluded. He\u2019s also due to have a \u201cworking breakfast\u201d Saturday with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman - where rising tensions with Iran will surely be discussed. It\u2019s just been confirmed that America\u2019s economy grew at a steady pace in the first quarter of 2019. US GDP expanded at an annualised rate of 3.1% in January-March, says the commerce department in its latest assessment, matching earlier readings. The figures show that trade made a positive contribution to growth, with exports up 5.4% and imports down 1.9%. That should please the White House, and may show that president Trump\u2019s trade war is having an impact - forcing US consumers and businesses to buy less from abroad. However, the report also shows that consumer spending slowed, rising by just 0.9% in the quarter. Spending on durable items, such as cars and computers, declined by 2.4%. Businesses expanded their inventories, boosting growth, while investment by companies also rose. Donald Trump is also due to meet Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan at the G20. That could be a challenging meeting, as the US is preparing sanctions on Turkey if it goes ahead with the purchase of a Russian anti-aircraft missile system. Kim Catechis, portfolio manager at Legg Mason affiliate Martin Currie, predicts fireworks: \u201cWhilst Turkey is facing some serious fundamental challenges, geopolitical events are complicating matters further. Ankara and Washington are on a collision course over the imminent deployment of Russian missiles and its support for Iran, Russia and Qatar versus the US- supported Saudi Arabia and Israel. \u201cTrump and Erdogan are meeting at the G20 in Japan this weekend. We expect this meeting to be fiery and believe it will result in sanctions, knocking investor confidence even further.\u201d Donald Trump has been whisked from the airport to dinner, with Australia\u2019s prime minister Scott Morrison (fresh from his re-election). On the US side of the table is US treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, national security advisor John Bolton and trade representative Robert Lighthizer, along with White House advisors Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump. Morrison is accompanied by finance minister Mathias Cormann, trade minister Simon Birmingham and Australia\u2019s Washington ambassador Joe Hockey. Morrison is expected to urge Trump to end the trade war with China. Yesterday he vowed that Australia wouldn\u2019t be a \u201cpassive bystander\u201d, saying: \u201cThe impact of any further deterioration of the relationship will not be limited to these two major powers. The balance between strategic engagement and strategic competition in the US-China relationship has shifted. This was inevitable.\u201d Despite the UN finding \u201ccredible evidence\u201d that Saudi Arabia is responsible for the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi last year, crown prince Mohammed bin Salman is still welcome at the G20 meeting. MBS has landed at Osaka, where he\u2019s expected to meet with Donald Trump on Saturday. European stock markets have dropped into the red, as investors worry that Donald Trump will not accept China\u2019s reported demands to end the trade war. The EU-wide Stoxx 600 is now down 0.2%, with losses in London, Paris and Amsterdam (all down around 0.4%). Significant news on the trade war: China is planning to present Donald Trump with the proposed terms of a settlement to end their trade war. That\u2019s according to the Wall Street Journal, which is reporting that Beijing has drawn up several conditions, including Removing its blacklist on Huawai, which bans US firms from selling technology to the Chinese firm Removing all the tariffs recently imposed on Chinese imports into America Dropping efforts to force China to buy more US goods. These are quite significant demands -- it\u2019s not clear that Trump would accept them, unless China is also making major concessions on, say, forced technology transfers and access to its economy. The WSJ says: The U.S. chief trade negotiator, Robert Lighthizer, and his Chinese counterpart, Liu He, talked by telephone this week on ways to get the talks back on track and expect to meet in person in advance of the presidents\u2019 Saturday lunch meeting after a Group of 20 summit in Osaka, said people familiar with the discussions. It is far from clear what the two will manage\u2014and whether their bosses will approve their work. Despite his preconditions, Mr. Xi isn\u2019t expected to take a confrontational tone with Mr. Trump, according to the Chinese officials. Rather, they say, he will sketch out what he envisions as an optimal bilateral relationship, which includes China\u2019s help on security issues vexing to the U.S., especially Iran and North Korea. Air Force One has touched down in Osaka, bringing Donald Trump and his entourage to the G20 meeting. The President has just left the plane, walked down the steps clutching an umbrella (luckily for him, the wind has died down a little). His daughter Ivanka was close behind. They\u2019re now in an armoured car (the famous high-tech \u201cBeast\u201d, I think), leaving the airport. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has been spotted in Osaka, having stopped off in India for meetings on his way to the G20 summit. Pompeo seemed to enjoy his trip to New Delhi, declaring that the partnership between the US and India is \u201calready beginning to reach new heights\u201d -- ironically, just before Trump\u2019s tweet threatened to undermine it. As Pompeo put it yesterday: Great friends are bound to have disagreements. The United States has been clear we seek greater market access and the removal of trade barriers in our economic relationship. And today, I address these differences in the spirit of friendship and I think that the two of us will be able to see a good outcome for each of our two countries,\u201d The stormy weather at Osaka airport may, alas, match the mood inside the G20 summit over the next few days. Donald Trump has now picked fights with three major international rivals: Telling India to reverse its new tariffs on some US imports Threatening more tariffs on China, while claiming its economy is going down the tubes Criticising America\u2019s pledge to defend Japan, claiming it is one-sided as Japan \u201cdoesn\u2019t have to help us at all\u201d and \u201ccan watch it on the Sony television.\u201d The AFP newswire sets the scene.... US President Donald Trump set the tone Thursday for what promises to be a stormy G20 summit by lashing out at friends and foes alike over trade tariffs and foreign policy. The long-running US-China trade war looked set to dominate the two-day meeting of world leaders in Osaka from Friday but clashes also loomed over climate and a series of hotspots ranging from North Korea to Iran. On board Air Force One en route to Japan, Trump fired off a characteristically bullish tweet, chiding long-standing ally India for \u201cunacceptable\u201d tariffs on American goods. The first casualty of the G20 meeting appears to be umbrellas, as the Osaka weather strikes. This appears to be Sky\u2019s diplomatic editor, Dominic Waghorn, getting off Theresa May\u2019s plane. Hopefully he can put any damage on expenses.... Donald Trump raised the heat ahead of his meeting with president Xi, by claiming that China\u2019s economy was \u201cgoing down the tubes\u201d. But is he right, or is this just White House hyperbole? My colleague Martin Farrer has dug into the data, and explains all here: Anyone attending the G20 meeting needs to have packed their best warm, waterproof clothes. World leaders arriving at Kansai airport in Izumisano city, Osaka, are getting a wet and windy reception - umbrellas and coats are certainly required. Over in Osaka, world leaders have been arriving ahead of the G20 summit (which runs from Friday to Saturday). India\u2019s leader, Narendra Modi, has already met with Japan\u2019s Shinzo Abe -- I wonder if Trump\u2019s tweet came up.... Government spokesman Raveesh Kumar has said the pair discussed \u201ca broad range of topics of mutual interest\u201d, after enjoying a warm handshake and hug. European stock markets have also risen this morning, boosted by hopes of a US-China trade ceasefire. The Europe-wide Stoxx 600 index is up 0.2%, lifted by gains in Italy and Germany. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, says the G20 summit in Osaka is crucial for market prospects this summer: This weekend is extremely important for the future direction of global stock markets. The G20 summit will include trade talks between the US and China and investors will be looking for any sign that the two countries can sort out their differences. It\u2019s worth reiterating that India only hiked tariffs on US goods in retaliation for America imposing new tariffs on its steel and aluminium exports. Narendra Modi\u2019s government had sought an exemption to those tariffs (which Donald Trump imposed as part of his plan to support American steelmakers). But when they were rebuffed, India import tariffs on more than 20 items from the US \u2014 including almonds, apples, walnuts, chickpeas and phosphoric acid. Bloomberg\u2019s Shawn Donnan suggests Trump should have mentioned this.... India\u2019s stock market is taking Trump\u2019s trade tweet in its stride. The SENSEX index has gained 168 points to 39,760, a rise of 0.44% - taking it close to this month\u2019s record high. But investors will be watching events in Osaka, Japan closely over the next few days as it hosts the G20. Saurabh Jain of SMC Global Securities explains: \u201cMarkets are jittery due to the uncertainty coming from the trade tiffs between U.S. and China and markets will continue to be cautious till the conclusion from the G20 meeting comes out. Intriguingly, the South China Morning Post is reporting that Washington and Beijing have \u201ctentatively agreed\u201d a trade war truce. This ceasefire (if confirmed), would give them a window of opportunity to resume negotiations to end the trade war. The SCMP says: Details of the agreement are being laid out in press releases in advance of the meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump at the Group of 20 leaders summit in Osaka, Japan, this weekend, according to three sources \u2013 one in Beijing and two in Washington. Such an agreement would avert the next round of tariffs on an additional US$300 billion of Chinese imports, which if applied would extend punitive tariffs to virtually all the country\u2019s shipments to the United States. Stock markets are rising today, on hopes of trade war progress at the G20 meeting. China\u2019s CSI 300 index has risen by 1%, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei gained 1.2%. The rally comes after US treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin claimed that the US and China were 90% of the way towards a trade deal. Donald Trump\u2019s tweet about India\u2019s tariffs has set the tone for the G20 summit, taking place on Friday and Saturday. The Indian government isn\u2019t accepting Trump\u2019s criticism, reports Reuters: India\u2019s tariffs are not that high compared to other developing countries, Indian government sources told Reuters on Thursday, reacting to United States President Donald Trump\u2019s call to withdraw what he said were very high tariffs. Earlier Trump tweeted that he looked forward to meeting Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the G20 summit in Japan, but said that for years India had put \u201cvery high tariffs against the United States\u201d. Adding: \u201cThis is unacceptable and the tariffs must be withdrawn!\u201d This month, India slapped higher tariffs on 28 U.S. products in retaliation for Washington\u2019s withdrawal this month of tariff-free trade for certain Indian goods. India\u2019s tariffs are in line with the World Trade Organization rules, the government sources said, adding that U.S. tariffs on some items were much higher than India\u2019s. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The threat of a global trade war is looming over the markets today, as world leaders prepare for a crunch meeting in Japan. Donald Trump has raised the stakes ahead of the G20 summit, threatening his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi. Although Trump proudly claims to be a \u201ctariff man\u201d, he doesn\u2019t like it when other people play the same trick. Trump is unhappy that India has just imposed tariffs on 28 US products, including almonds and apples. The new duties, some as high as 70%, are a tit-for-tat retaliation for America\u2019s refusal to exempt Delhi from higher taxes on steel and aluminium imports. So, in a tweet blasted off en-route to the G20 meeting in Osaka, Trump has announced he\u2019ll have a stern word with Modi over the issue - demanding these tariffs are removed. Trump already had China and Vietnam in his spotlight. Yesterday, he declared that he was quite prepared to impose tariffs on all Chinese goods (currently more than $300bn has been spared so far). He told Fox Business Network. \u201cChina\u2019s economy is going down the tubes \u2013 they want to make a deal..... \u201cYou have another $325bn that I haven\u2019t taxed yet \u2013 it\u2019s ripe for taxing, for putting tariffs on.\u201d Trump also threatened to drag Vietnam into his trade war, expressing unhappiness that some firms are dodging the tariffs on Chinese goods: \u201cA lot of companies are moving to Vietnam, but Vietnam takes advantage of us even worse than China. So there\u2019s a very interesting situation going on there.\u201d Investors have been crossing their fingers, hoping that Trump would agree a ceasefire with China during the G20 meeting - he\u2019s due to meet president Xi on Saturday. There has been chatter that the US could suspend any further tariffs while a deal is stuck - although Trump\u2019s comments on Fox don\u2019t really bear that out.... Also coming up today, we get a new eurozone economic confidence report, and updated US growth figures for the January-March quarter. The agenda 10am BST: Eurozone economic confidence figures for June 1pm BST: German inflation data for June 1.30pm BST: US GDP for Q1 2019 (third estimate).",

          "bodyText": "We\u2019re ending our live coverage for the day, thanks for tuning in! Some key links and updates from the day: Disgraced Alabama Republican Roy Moore has announced he is running for US Senate again in 2020 after failing to win the seat two years ago amid sexual misconduct accusations. Joe Biden continued to deal with the fallout from his latest gaffe in which he discussed his cordial relationship with segregationists early in his career. Trump stopped short of escalating the worsening standoff with Iran in the Persian Gulf, suggesting that the shooting down of a US drone could have been carried out by a \u201cloose and stupid\u201d Iranian officer without authorization from Tehran. The Senate passed a bill that would stop arms sales to the Saudi government over the administration\u2019s objections. A legal team that recently interviewed more than 60 children at a Border Patrol facility in Texas said infants, children and teens have been locked up for up to 27 days without adequate food, water and sanitation. There were a number of new calls for an impeachment inquiry from Democratic members of Congress. The House Judiciary released a transcript of its interview with Hope Hicks, the former Trump confidante, revealing the repeated objections of the White House during her questioning. The National Rifle Association sued its former president, Oliver North. A federal appeals court ruled that new rules from the Trump administration restricting abortion access can take effect while a legal battle over the policy moves forward. Some politics news outside of DC: In Oregon, all 12 Republican state senators literally fled the capitol today to delay a vote on a clean energy bill. The state\u2019s Democratic governor responded by dispatching state troopers to retrieve the Republicans and get the legislative session back on track. The Guardian\u2019s Susie Cagle reports: Senate Republican leader Herman Baertschiger Jr wrote in a statement that the walk-out was \u201cexactly how we should be doing our job\u201d. In a speech on the Senate floor, a visibly frustrated Senate president Peter Courtney begged his colleagues to return. \u201cThis is the saddest day of my legislative life,\u201d he said. If passed into law, the clean energy jobs bill would place a cap on emissions from power, transportation and other industries in the state, and establish a system to auction and trade them. The program would begin in 2021, with the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 45% of 1990 carbon levels by 2035, and 20% of 1990 levels by 2050. Full story here: New rules from the Trump administration restricting abortion access can take effect while a legal battle over the policy moves forward, a federal appeals court ruled today. From AP: The rules ban taxpayer-funded clinics from making abortion referrals and prohibit clinics that receive federal money from sharing office space with abortion providers \u2014 a rule critics said would force many to find new locations, undergo expensive remodels or shut down. More than 20 states and several civil rights and health organizations challenged the rules in cases filed in Oregon, Washington and California. Judges in all three states blocked the rules from taking effect, with Oregon and Washington courts issuing nationwide injunctions. One called the new policy \u201cmadness\u201d and said it was motivated by \u201can arrogant assumption that the government is better suited to direct women\u2019s health care than their providers.\u201d Planned Parenthood said it would ask the federal appeals court to reconsider the decision, which affects Title X, a 1970 law that improved access to family planning services. Here\u2019s the response from Dr Leana Wen, president of the Planned Parenthood: Some background on the original rule here: House Republicans have released a statement on their meeting with Trump and have called for a \u201cmeasured response\u201d to Iran. They said the president and his national security team \u201cremain clear-eyed on the situation and what must be done\u201d: The backstory here: Joe Biden has called Cory Booker to \u201ctry to smooth over tensions\u201d, the New York Times reports: A Booker spokesperson said of the call with Biden: Cory shared directly what he said publicly \u2014 including helping Vice President Biden understand why the word \u2018boy\u2019 is painful to so many. Cory believes that Vice President Biden should take responsibility for what he said and apologize to those who were hurt. It appears Biden has not apologized. The controversy started when Biden spoke at a Wall Street fundraiser about \u201ccivility:\u201d and how he previously worked with segregationists in the Senate even though he disagreed with them. More on the background here: Alabama Senator Doug Jones has released a statement on the news that his previous competitor, disgraced Republican Roy Moore, is running again for Senate: Today, Roy Moore has made what was already going to be a divisive Republican primary even more polarizing and extreme. We don\u2019t need any more of that. Worse, it\u2019s now clear that my opponent will either be an extremist like Roy Moore or someone handpicked by Mitch McConnell to be his Senator, not Alabama\u2019s. The only question left is who will be McConnell\u2019s choice? I want to talk to Alabamians about solutions to improve all of our lives, address very real health care concerns, better education, strengthen our security, both militarily and economically, and help attract more businesses to our state. It comes down to solving problems, not divisive partisanship or extreme ideas that do nothing for Alabama families.\u201d The National Rifle Association\u2019s ongoing internal drama has escalated, this time with a lawsuit against the group\u2019s former president. From the AP: The National Rifle Association has sued its former president, Oliver North, for what it called \u201cconduct harmful to the NRA\u201d. The lawsuit was filed Wednesday in New York. It sought a judge\u2019s declaration that the NRA isn\u2019t required to pay North\u2019s legal bills. North stepped down from the post in April. The lawsuit said he \u201cdeparted office after a widely publicized, failed coup attempt\u201d. The suit also accused top NRA official Chris Cox of conspiring with North to oust the organization\u2019s chief executive, Wayne LaPierre. Some context on the recent NRA troubles: Some initial analysis on the Hope Hicks interview transcript \u2013 it appears the White House intervened to block her from answer questions more than 150 times: Then there was this exchange: The House Judiciary has just released a transcript of the interview with Hope Hicks, the former White House communications director and longtime Trump confidante. Read it here: Here\u2019s a look at how some Republican politicians are responding to the news that disgraced Alabama Republican Roy Moore is running again for Senate. A reminder of the sexual misconduct and abuse allegations that led him to lose the Senate race two years ago: During the 2017 race, six women accused Moore of pursuing romantic or sexual relationships with them when they were teenagers as young as 14 and he was an assistant district attorney in his 30s. Two accused him of assault or molestation. Our full story: There have been a number of new calls for an impeachment inquiry from Democratic members of Congress today: Hello - Sam Levin here in the San Francisco office, taking over our live coverage for the rest of the day. A legal team that recently interviewed more than 60 children at a Border Patrol facility in Texas has described a traumatic and dangerous situation, according to a new AP report: The lawyers said roughly 250 infants, children and teens have been locked up for up to 27 days without adequate food, water and sanitation. Some more disturbing details: A team of attorneys who recently visited the facility near El Paso told the AP that three girls, ages 10 to 15, said they had been taking turns keeping watch over a sick 2-year-old boy because there was no one else to look after him. When the lawyers saw the 2-year-old boy, he wasn\u2019t wearing a diaper and had wet his pants, and his shirt was smeared in mucus. They said at least 15 children at the facility had the flu, and some were kept in medical quarantine. Children told lawyers that they were fed uncooked frozen food or rice and had gone weeks without bathing or a clean change of clothes at the facility in Clint, in the desert scrubland some 25 miles southeast of El Paso. Holly Cooper, an attorney who represents detained youth, said: In my 22 years of doing visits with children in detention I have never heard of this level of inhumanity.\u201d Customs and Border Protection did not immediately respond to the allegations about the conditions, the AP reported. That\u2019s it for me today. Before I pass the blog to my esteemed colleague Sam Levin on the west coast, here\u2019s a quick recap of what you may have missed today. Roy Moore, the hard-right 2017 failed Senate candidate has announced he\u2019s running again in 2020- with no support to be found in the party establishment. Gaffe-prone Democratic frontrunner Joe Biden continues to deal with the fallout from his latest gaffe in which he, voluntarily, and with no prompting from anyone else, brought up his cordial relationship with segregationists early in his career. Trump seemed to downplay any retaliation with Iran for the shooting down of a US drone overnight, suggesting that it may have even been a mistake. The Senate passed a bill that would stop arms sales to the Saudi government over the administration\u2019s objections but does not currently have the votes to overcome a Trump veto, which the president has threatened. Huffington Post reporter Kevin Robillard had some interesting Democratic horserace numbers from the latest Suffolk poll. Unsurprisingly, it contains bad news for NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell signaled on Thursday that he and his allies in the GOP establishment will actively work to oppose Roy Moore\u2019s bid for Alabama\u2019s Senate seat. \u201cHe can do what he wants to, but we\u2019re certainly going to oppose him in every way,\u201d McConnell told the Associated Press shortly before Moore\u2019s announcement. Donald Trump Jr also jumped into the fray, by implying that Moore had jumped into the race contrary to the president\u2019s wishes. Federal prosecutors say that former Trump confidant and current federal defendant Roger Stone violated a gag order with recent social media posts, according to multiple reports. In January the longtime GOP operative was charged with witness tampering, obstructing an official proceeding, and five counts of making false statements. He is currently awaiting trial. Cory Booker announced Thursday, that if elected president he would \u201cimmediately\u201d start the clemency process for some 17,000 federal inmates serving time on drug-related charges. Booker would essentially be using executive power to do what the First Step act, passed last year, declined to do - make sentencing reform retroactive so it applies both to people currently in jail and future criminal defendants. In the last day, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have both come out and offered some level of support for the decriminalization of sex work, reports Vice: Less than 24 hours after Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would be \u201copen\u201d to decriminalizing sex work, the Bernie Sanders campaign told VICE the candidate believes it\u2019s a policy that \u201cshould be considered.\u201d \u201cBernie believes that decriminalization is certainly something that should be considered,\u201d Deputy Communications Director Sarah Ford said in an email Thursday morning. \u201cOther countries have done this and it has shown to make the lives of sex workers safer.\u201d Warren said Wednesday that: I\u2019m open to decriminalization. Sex workers, like all workers, deserve autonomy but they are particularly vulnerable to physical and financial abuse and hardship,\u201d Warren said. \u201cWe need to make sure that we don\u2019t undermine legal protections for the most vulnerable, including the millions of individuals who are victims of human trafficking each year.\u201d Alabama Roy Moore has made his candidacy for the 2020 Senate seat in that state official, announcing moments ago. \u201cYes, I will run for the United States Senate in 2020,\u201d Moore said. \u201cCan I win? Yes, I can win.\u201d His opening remarks make it clear he intends to run as an outsider from his own party, which largely abandoned him after the allegations that dogged his 2017 candidacy emerged. Moore is also blaming the NRSC for Donald Trump\u2019s opposition to his candidacy, reports the Montgomery Advertiser\u2019s Brian Lyman. \u201cI think he\u2019s being pushed by the NRSC. I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s thinking. I can\u2019t speak for him. But I can say I don\u2019t disagree with him in lots of his policies,\u201d Moore said. California Senator and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris penned an op-ed for NBC News Thursday asking Americans generally, and Donald Trump specifically, to watch Ava DuVernay\u2019s new Netflix series on the Central Park Five. The plea comes just a few days after Trump told reporters that he would not apologize to the five Black men he demonized in 1989 after they were accused of a violent rape they did not commit. Trump infamously took out full-page ads in four New York newspapers advocating that the state reinstate capital punishment so that it could execute the boys, who were coerced into admitting their guilt. The five were exonerated in 2002 after another man admitted to committing the crime and DNA evidence corroborated his account. Harris, a former prosecutor writes: DuVernay\u2019s retelling of the case is a masterpiece. Her four-part series tells the stories of Korey Wise, Raymond Santana, Antron McCray, Kevin Richardson and Yusef Salaam. In 1989, these five young boys were wrongfully accused of brutally raping a jogger in Central Park. The series chronicles their unjust detainment, illegal interrogation and the dismissal of evidence that pointed to their innocence, further highlighting the flaws in a system that is supposed to be rooted in truth and justice. Systemic biases and racism cost these boys their childhood. Sensationalized media coverage \u2014 including a 1989 full-page ad placed by Trump \u2014 made it almost impossible for them to be treated fairly. And the trial also exposed the dehumanization of Black children and life-threatening consequences \u2014 things that still occur today. House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff wants to make it \u201ccrystal clear\u201d that accepting help or \u201cdirt\u201d from a foreign agent is illegal with a new bill proposal. This is something Donald Trump has repeatedly said, most recently in an interview with ABC News, that he would do. A number of high profile celebrities joined together for a video editorial that describes the Mueller report as \u201cthe most damming evidence ever compiled against a sitting US president.\u201d The video, released by Now This News also excoriated AG William Barr for having \u201clie[d] about its contents\u201d and Trump for echoing that \u201cpropaganda.\u201d The stars include: Robert De Niro Martin Sheen Christine Lahti Laurence Fishburne Stephen King Sophia Bush Jonathan Van Ness Rob Reiner George Takei Rosie Perez Kendrick Sampson The Wall Street Journal is reporting that President Trump plans to issue an executive order on Monday to compel the disclosure of prices in health care. According to people familiar with the matter, the order will direct federal agencies to initiate regulations and guidance that could require insurers, doctors, hospitals and others in the industry to provide information about the negotiated and often discounted cost of care. According to the Journal, Advocates say that consumers and employers \u201cwill benefit because pulling back the secrecy around the prices will allow them to shop for lower cost care and benefits.\u201d Industry groups including hospitals and insurers have balked at the idea however, saying \u201cit could cause costs to climb if some businesses learn competitors are getting bigger discounts. They also say consumers really want to know their own out-of-pocket costs and won\u2019t benefit from full disclosure of negotiated prices.\u201d Apple is asking the US government to exclude its products\u2014including the ubiquitous iPhone\u2014 from President Trump\u2019s next round of proposed tariffs on Chinese imports. The Hill reports that in a letter made public on Thursday, \u201cthe tech giant wrote that the tariffs could give an advantage to Apple\u2019s Chinese competitors as well as reduce Apple\u2019s contributions to the US economy.\u201d \u201cU.S. tariffs would also weigh on Apple\u2019s global competitiveness,\u201d Apple wrote to US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. \u201cThe Chinese producers we compete with in global markets do not have a significant presence in the U.S. market, and so would not be impacted by U.S. tariffs. Neither would our other major non-U.S. competitors.\u201d A US tariff would, therefore, tilt the playing field in favor of our global competitors.\u201d -Apple Politico is reporting that longtime former Trump confidante Hope Hicks broke with President Donald Trump during her interview with the House Judiciary Committee this week, telling lawmakers that offers of foreign assistance in U.S. elections should be \u201crejected and reported to the FBI.\u201d That disclosure comes courtesy of house judiciary chairman Jerry Nadler. The remarks from Hicks stand in contrast to Trump\u2019s statement on ABC news last week about what he would do if a foreign power came to him with opposition research on a political opponent. Trump: I think you might want to listen, there isn\u2019t anything wrong with listening... If somebody called from a country, Norway, [and said] \u2018we have information on your opponent\u2019 -- oh, I think I\u2019d want to hear it.\u201d From Politico: \u201cHicks, sat for nearly eight hours behind closed doors with the committee on Wednesday and fielded questions on several subjects related to her tenure as a senior aide on the Trump campaign, the presidential transition period, and in the White House as communications director.\u201d Alabama Republican Roy Moore, whose unsuccessful 2017 campaign for US Senate was marred by allegations he sexually assaulted or pursued teenage girls while in his 30s, is going to try again. The Democratic candidate, Doug Jones, a former federal prosecutor, defeated Moore by a narrow margin in a special election in December 2017 to fill the seat vacated by Republican Jeff Sessions when he became US attorney general. Jones was the first Democrat in a quarter-century to be elected to the US Senate in Alabama. Moore, a 72-year-old former state chief judge known for staunchly conservative views, could face Jones again if he wins the party primary. Former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders hold narrow leads in a theoretical showdown with President Trump in North Carolina ahead of the 2020 presidential race, according to a new Public Policy Polling survey released Thursday. From The Hill: Forty-nine percent of registered voters surveyed said they would back Biden in a match-up against Trump, while 46 percent said they would support the president. Five percent, meanwhile, said they are unsure who they\u2019d back. In a match-up against Sanders, 48 percent of North Carolina voters said they\u2019d back the Vermont senator, compared with 47 percent who said they would vote for Trump; 5 percent said they were unsure of their pick. No other candidate leads Trump in the poll. From Associated Press reporter Jill Colvin: I asked Trump today whether he believes there are members of his administration who are trying to push him into conflict w Iran. His response? \u201cNo, not at all. Not at all. In fact, in many cases, it\u2019s the opposite.\u201d Then talked about campaigning on getting out of endless wars. The Washington Post is reporting that the Senate passed measures to block President Trump from using his emergency authority to complete several arms sales benefiting Saudi Arabia on Thursday. From the Post: A bipartisan group of senators, led by Senator\u2019s Robert Menendez (D-NJ) and Trump booster Lindsey Graham (R-SC), had initially filed 22 resolutions of disapproval against the sales \u2014 one for every contract the administration had expedited by emergency order, effectively sidestepping congressional opposition. But after weeks of negotiations, Senate leaders agreed to hold just three votes, which will encompass the substance of all the blocking resolutions, congressional aides said. The Trump administration sent a letter to the Senate Thursday to let lawmakers know that if the bill made it to Trump\u2019s desk, \u201chis advisors would recommend he veto it.\u201d Trump has cited rising tensions with Iran as justification for using his emergency powers to complete the deals. The Post continued: Republican leaders have repeatedly stated their opposition to the effort and support for the president, making the prospect of securing 67 votes for the resolutions \u2014 a veto-proof majority \u2014 difficult. Once the Senate completes its votes, the resolutions will go to the House, where Democratic leaders have been waiting to see whether the Senate would have any difficulty passing the resolutions before taking their own steps to block Trump\u2019s actions. Meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Trump seems to be striking a conciliatory tone on Iran- suggesting that the shooting down of a US drone may even have been accidental. \u201cI find it hard to believe it was intentional,\u201d Trump said. Trump added: \u201cI imagine someone made a mistake...in shooting down the drone. We didn\u2019t have a man or woman in the drone. It would have made a big, big difference.\u201d But the remarks weren\u2019t without bluster either. Donald Trump continues to conduct foreign diplomacy like the reality TV star he is, essentially encouraging the global citizenry to \u201cstay tuned for next week\u201d when asked if he will authorize a strike against Iran amid growing tensions. The comment follows a tweet earlier in the day in which Trump, again opaquely, suggested \u201cIran made a very big mistake!\u201d in response to word that the nation had shot down a US drone. Nancy Pelosi calls the Trump administration\u2019s eight-year delay of a new $20 US banknote honoring abolitionist Harriet Tubman \u201can insult to the hopes of millions.\u201d \u201cThis unnecessary decision must be reversed,\u201d Pelosi continued in a Tweet. The Treasury Department was expected to release the updated bill in 2020, but announced last month that the project would be postponed for at least eight years. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin implausibly cited \u201ccounterfeiting issues,\u201d as the reason for the delay. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on Wednesday called for an investigation into Mnuchin\u2019s decision. A group of four high-profile Democratic lawmakers, including presidential candidate Kamala Harris, have introduced legislation to Protect the US Justice Department from that they call \u201cWhite House meddling\u201d. Senators Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), and Kamala Harris (D-CA) and Congressman Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) introduced the Security from Political Interference in Justice Act in what they describe as a bid \u201cto increase transparency in the relationship between the U.S. Department of Justice and the White House and prevent political interference in law enforcement decisions.\u201d The lawmakers go on in a release to say that \u201cThe bill would impose important reporting requirements for contacts between the Justice Department and White House pertaining to specific cases or investigations.\u201d Never before have we seen a president so heedless of the Department\u2019s traditions and spirit, and so singularly focused on his own political and personal self-interest at the expense of justice. This bill would protect the Department against the likes of Donald Trump by shining a much-needed light on the channels that have enabled political influence to flow into the Department.\u201d -Senator Sheldon Whitehouse Biden calls the developments in Iran a \u201cself-inflicted disaster\u201d by the Trump administration. Speaking to reporters Thursday morning, House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the US has no appetite to go to war with Iran, after Tehran shot down a U.S. military surveillance drone over the Strait of Hormuz. Pelosi said that a group of 20 lawmakers was preparing to receive a briefing on the \u201cdangerous situation\u201d in Iran shortly thereafter. The top House Democrat also weighed in on Joe Biden\u2019s very bad 48 hours Thursday, saying she had \u201cno criticism\u201d of his remarks. I have no criticism of what he believes is his story to tell the American people, that he will work with anyone to get a good result for the American people.\u201d -Nancy Pelosi \u201cWhat I think is most important for all the candidates is authenticity, they are who they are, they\u2019ve lived a life and they have grown from their experiences, and I think that\u2019s what he\u2019s trying to tell us,\u201d Pelosi told MSNBC\u2019s Andrea Mitchell. Democratic candidates Cory Booker and Joe Biden continue to snip back and forth over Biden\u2019s now widely-panned remarks about working with segregationists. Booker chimed in with a third volley last night on CNN. What matters to me is that a guy running to be the head of our party, which is a significantly diverse and wondrous party, doesn\u2019t even understand and can\u2019t even acknowledge that he made a mistake, whether the intention was there or not,\u201d Booker said. \u201cInstead, he\u2019s fallen back into the defensive crouch that often people say, which is \u2018Cory called me a racist\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m not a racist,\u2019 which is not what I said, and not what I\u2019m calling him.\u201d \u201cThis is the problem. He knows better,\u201d he continued. \u201cAt a time when Donald Trump never apologizes for anything and starts to create that toxic sentiment that you never apologize ... I know Joe Biden. He\u2019s better than this.\u201d The controversy began after comments Biden made at a Wall Street fundraiser at New York\u2019s Carlyle Hotel on Monday, intended to highlight his ability to work across diverse viewpoints to get things done. Biden cited segregationists James Eastland of Mississippi and Herman E Talmadge of Georgia, as two senators with whom he disagreed, but still worked with and \u201cgot things done\u201d. I was in a caucus with James O Eastland,\u201d Biden told guests of the event, briefly imitating the senator\u2019s southern drawl, according to the press pool report. \u201cHe never called me \u2018boy\u2019, he always called me \u2018son\u2019,\u201d he said. He went on to describe Talmadge as \u201cone of the meanest guys\u201d he ever knew but said, \u201cAt least there was some civility. We got things done.\u201d Both senators are remembered for their racist views. Booker chimed in initially: \u201cBiden\u2019s relationships with proud segregationists are not the model for how we make America a safer and more inclusive place for black people, and for everyone.\u201d He also called for the former vice-president to issue \u201can immediate apology\u201d. Biden seemed to take the remarks personally, responding to Booker: \u201cCory should apologize...He knows better. There\u2019s not a racist bone in my body. I\u2019ve been involved in civil rights my whole career. Period,\u201d prompting Booker\u2019s second response on CNN last night. The entire kerfuffle came as Black Americans celebrate the emancipation holiday known as Juneteenth, and as lawmakers on the hill held hearings on reparations for the descendants of US slavery and segregation. Ranking House Judiciary member Doug Collins blasted today\u2019s Mueller report hearing in a statement accusing Democrats of \u201ctheater\u201d and trying to \u201credo\u201d the Mueller report. I\u2019m concerned the majority\u2019s witnesses may not be here to discuss Volume II, or to offer \u201cbipartisan perspectives.\u201d I am glad we are allegedly focusing on election security today, but I urge the majority to stop trying to re-do the Mueller investigation and hold a hearing promptly on election security. We don\u2019t need theater. We don\u2019t need John Dean, Part Two. As to the substance, I\u2019d like to remind everyone: Democrats spent two years claiming the president was a Russian asset who conspired with the Kremlin to steal the election. The special counsel spent two years investigating whether the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with Russia. Well, the special counsel finished his investigation and found no Americans, no one on the Trump campaign, conspired or coordinated with Russians. That was great news for America. I thought it would be great news to all Americans. To my surprise, it wasn\u2019t. Democrats were not only disappointed, they were angry. Angry the president was not a Russian asset. Imagine disliking a president so much you wished he were a foreign agent. That\u2019s where Democrats are today. Despite the Mueller report\u2019s conclusion there was no conspiracy, Democrats have spent the past few months trying desperately to revive their Russia conspiracy theory. Democrats spent two years calling Mueller\u2019s team the best of the best, but, since they didn\u2019t like the outcome, Democrats now want to play prosecutor and re-do Mueller\u2019s investigation. Ivanka Trump was accused on Thursday of violating the Hatch Act that bans government workers from speaking out on political campaign issues, over tweets she wrote ahead of her father\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign launch. Influential Washington-based watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Crew) has filed a complaint against Donald Trump\u2019s daughter and senior aide, who works in the White House as his adviser, albeit unsalaried. She is accused of violating the rule that limits political activity by federal employees. In a letter to the Office of Special Counsel (OSC), part of the Department of Justice, Crew said her tweet, posted on Father\u2019s Day last weekend, just a few days before Trump\u2019s re-election campaign launch in Florida, included his 2016 campaign slogan \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d and claimed \u201cthe best is yet to come\u201d. The complaint comes just a week after the OSC, a US federal watchdog, called on the president to sack Trump Aide Kellyanne Conway over multiple violations of the Hatch Act. Iran has shot down an US drone in the strait of Hormuz, accusing Washington of breaching Iran\u2019s national sovereignty and trying to deepen tensions in the region. Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards said on Thursday that they had used a surface to air missile to shoot down what they called a US \u201cspy\u201d drone they claimed was flying in the country\u2019s airspace. US Central Command confirmed that one of its unmanned aircraft had been taken down, but said it was in international airspace. A CentCom spokesman, Capt Bill Urban said it was a US navy Global Hawk surveillance drone, which had been downed by an Iranian surface-to-air missile over the Strait of Hormuz at 11.35pm GMT. \u201cIranian reports that the aircraft was over Iran are false. This was an unprovoked attack on a U.S. surveillance asset in international airspace,\u201d Urban said. Read more In space news, The Navy briefed three senators Wednesday on a number of reported encounters with unidentified aircraft amid growing requests from members of oversight committees. The Hill reports that Virginia Senator Mark Warner\u2019s office confirmed the meeting. \u201cIf pilots at Oceana or elsewhere are reporting flight hazards that interfere with training or put them at risk, then Senator Warner wants answers. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s weather balloons, little green men, or something else entirely \u2014 we can\u2019t ask our pilots to put their lives at risk unnecessarily,\u201d his spokesperson, Rachel Cohen, said in a statement. In other space news, Americans are at odds with the White House plans to send manned missions to the moon and or mars. According to a new poll the country much prefers a space program that focuses on potential asteroid impacts, scientific research and using robots to explore the cosmos. The poll by The Associated Press and the NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, released Thursday, one month before the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing, lists asteroid and comet monitoring as the No. 1 desired objective for the U.S. space program. About two-thirds of Americans call that very or extremely important, and about a combined 9 in 10 call it at least moderately important. By contrast, only about a quarter of Americans said moon or Mars exploration by astronauts should be among the space program\u2019s highest priorities. About another third called each of those moderately important. Billionaire Tom Steyer will air a new commercial on Fox &amp; Friends Friday and Monday advocating for impeachment. According to Politico, Steyer\u2019s group Need to Impeach is putting $700,000 behind the ad and selected the time slot so as to hopefully catch Trump\u2019s eye \u2013 the president is a frequent viewer of the program. \u201cRight now, Donald Trump is committing crimes in the open,\u201d Steyer says in the ad, citing Trump\u2019s ongoing dismissal of congressional subpoenas, and his declaration that he would listen to opposition research supplied by a foreign power in the 2020 campaign. \u201cThe Mueller report identified multiple instances of obstruction of justice,\u201d Steyer continues. Good morning and welcome to the politics blog for Thursday, 20 June. The House Judiciary Committee is kicking off its second \u201clessons from the Mueller report\u201d hearing shortly. The first round, which happened a week and a half ago, featured former Nixon counsel John Dean who testified that there were \u201cexhaustive\u201d and \u201cremarkable\u201d parallels between special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report, and the findings compiled in the wake of the Watergate scandal. Today\u2019s hearing, entitled \u201cbipartisan perspectives\u201d, is scheduled to include experts on constitutional law, separation of powers, cybersecurity, and election law.",

Canada resettled 28,100 refugees in 2018, overtaking the US for the first time since the 1980 Refugee Act, said the report from the UN high commissioner for refugees (UNHCR) on Wednesday. In contrast, the US \u2013 which has a population nearly 10 times that of Canada \u2013 took in 23,000 refugees \u2013 a dramatic reduction from a recent high of 97,000 in 2016. \u201cThe sharp drop in US refugee resettlement is in part due to the Trump administration\u2019s decision to set a considerably lower cap on the number of refugees allowed into the US than in previous years,\u201d said a report from the Pew Research Center on the decline, adding the president determines refugee caps. Canada also leads in per-capita rates, resettling 756 refugees per million residents. Other countries, including Australia (510), Sweden (493) and Norway (465) also had relatively high resettlement rates. The US settled 70 refugees per million residents. Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has made the resettlement of Syrian refugees a priority for the country, publicly welcoming families at the airport in 2016. Last year, more than 18,000 refugees became Canadian citizens. While Canada led all other countries, it has also decreased its resettlement rate from a 2016 high of 47,000 refugees. Refugee resettlement globally dipped in 2018 to 92,000 people, down from 103,000 in 2017 and a further drop from 189,000 in 2016. The UNHCR reported on Wednesday that more than 70 million people have fled conflict and persecution: the highest number since the second world war. Most of those displaced come from the Middle East and are casualties of the Syrian civil war. UNHCR\u2019s representative in Canada praised the country\u2019s effort so far \u2013 but called for more action. \u201cIt is time for us to recognize what these refugees bring to Canada, culturally and economically: they make us a stronger and more prosperous society,\u201d said Jean-Nicolas Beuze in a statement. \u201cThe Canadian experience shows that welcoming refugees is a win-win. This undoubtedly provides an antidote to the too-often toxic and misleading narratives against displaced people we are hearing globally, and in Canada.\u201d",

As one of them recently put it all the heroes are buried here. But we know what these men did. We knew how brave they were.</p> \n   <p>They came here and saved freedom. And then they went home and showed us all what freedom is all about.</p> \n   <p>The American sons and daughters who saw us to victory were no less extraordinary in peace. They build families. They built industries. They built a national culture that inspired the entire world. In the decades that followed, America defeated Communism, secured civil rights, revolutionise science, launched a man to the moon, and then kept on pushing to new frontiers. And today, America is stronger than ever before.</p> \n   <p>Seven decades ago, the warriors of the day fought a sinister enemy who spoke of 1,000 year Empire. in defeating that evil, they left a legacy that will last not only for 1,000 years, but for all time.</p> \n   <p>For as long as the soul knows of duty and honour, for as long as freedom keeps its hold on the human heart. For the men who sit behind me, and to the boys who rest in the field before me. Your examples will never, ever grow old. Your Spirit, brave, unyielding and true, will never die.</p> \n   <p>The blood that they spilled, the tears that they shed. The lives that they gave the sacrifice that they made, did not just win a battle. It did not just win a war.</p> \n   <p>Those who fought here won a future for our nation. They won the survival of our civilization. And they showed us the way to love, cherish and defend our way of life for many centuries to come.</p> \n   <p>Today as we stand together upon this sacred earth we pledge that our nation will forever be strong and united.</p> \n   <p>We will forever ever be together. Our people will forever be bold.</p> \n   <p>Our hearts will forever be loyal. And our children and their children will forever and always be free.</p> \n   <p>May God bless our great veterans. May God bless our allies. May God bless the heroes of D-day. And may God bless America.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e6d43d4abb0c47b887db4f6010de004460e067b0\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6d43d4abb0c47b887db4f6010de004460e067b0/0_148_3105_1863/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump and Macron attend a commemoration ceremony for the 75th anniversary of D-Day at the American cemetery of Colleville-sur-Mer in Normandy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump and Macron attend a commemoration ceremony for the 75th anniversary of D-Day at the American cemetery of Colleville-sur-Mer in Normandy</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlos Barr\u00eda/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5cf8ec888f08fd3169116a69\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-06T10:37:20.477Z\">11.37am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Meanwhile, a service has begun at the Commonwealth cemetery in Bayeux.

He had been on the beach for hours bleeding and saving lives when he finally lost consciousness.

While the French Resistance carried out extra ordinary acts of bravery behind enemy lines. Many were terribly wounded, and many made the ultimate sacrifice that day. And in the fierce fighting that followed. As together, our allied nations sought to release Europe from the grip of fascism ...</p> \n   <p> Here in Normandy, the names of those British men and women who gave their lives in defence of freedom will forever sit opposite their homeland across the channel, along with those of our allies. Here in Normandy, we will always remember their courage, their commitment, their conviction, and to our veterans here in Normandy today. I want to say the only words we can: thank you.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5cf8bc6f8f08fd3169116858\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-06T07:18:02.432Z\">8.18am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Macron tells May 'we can be proud of our work together'</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c803d39a1ebd135ad287c9f30eb84f2f29bb7d9e\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c803d39a1ebd135ad287c9f30eb84f2f29bb7d9e/0_218_3753_2252/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Macron thanks May during a Franco-British ceremony for the laying of the first stone of a British memorial in Ver-Sur-Mer\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Macron thanks May during a Franco-British ceremony for the laying of the first stone of a British memorial in Ver-Sur-Mer</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philippe Wojazer/POOL/EPA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>In his speech Macron paid tribute to May on one of her last official engagements as prime minister. </p> \n  <p>Speaking through a translator he said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>On a more personal level may I say to Theresa May how much friendship I feel for her and what a pleasure it\u2019s been to work in confidence and trust with her. </p> \n   <p>Leaders come and go.

          "bodyText": "France\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron, has appealed directly to Donald Trump to fulfil the \u201cpromise of Normandy\u201d by embracing pillars of the postwar peace such as the European Union and Nato as the two leaders marked the D-day landings 75 years ago. In a speech that trod a fine diplomatic line, Macron offered both sincere expressions of gratitude for the valour of US troops in the second world war and vehement calls for the White House to re-engage with the principles of multilateralism. Speaking at the American cemetery and memorial in Colleville-sur-Mer, Macron repeatedly name-checked Trump, even at times turning to face the US president who was sitting behind him. Trump praised America\u2019s \u201cexceptional might\u201d and warned it would \u201cforever be strong\u201d. He said US soldiers who liberated France were \u201csustained by the confidence that America can do anything. The exceptional might came from a truly exceptional spirit.\u201d Macron and Trump presented Legion d\u2019Honneur medals, France\u2019s highest honour, to five American D-day veterans.Speaking in English Macron said: \u201cFor what we owe to you veterans, our freedom, on behalf of my nation, I just want to say thank you.\u201d Ceremonies for the 75th anniversary of D-day began at 7.26am local time when a lone piper marked the minute the invasion began 75 years ago at Arromanches overlooking Gold beach.Pipe Major Trevor Macey-Lillie, of 19th Regiment Royal Artillery performed Highland Laddie as crowds gathered on the beach below. Pope Francis sent a message of thanks to the veterans that was read out at a service at Bayeux cathedral. He said: \u201cI express the hope that this commemoration event will allow all the generations in Europe, and the whole world, to strongly reassert that peace is based on the respect of each person, whatever his or her background.\u201d Theresa May paid tribute to the sense of duty shown by those who took part in the Normandy landings at a service at Ver-Sur-Mer. In one of her last duties as prime minister she said: \u201cThey didn\u2019t boast, they didn\u2019t fuss, they served. They did their duty, as they laid down their lives, so that we might have a better life and build a better world.\u201d Macron thanked May for the work she had done as prime minister. \u201cWe can be proud of the results achieved,\u201d he told her. Vladimir Putin has brushed off his lack of an invite to the commemorations marking the 75th anniversary of D-Day, saying he has \u201ca lot business to do\u201d in Russia. Speaking in St Petersburg on Thursday as world leaders gathered in Normandy to mark the occasion, Putin said: We do not invite everyone to every event, so why should I be necessarily invited somewhere? Am I a person to be present at every event? I have a lot business to do here in Russia. But if we are imagining conspiracy theories, maybe western leaders wanted to have their own chit chat before having some contact with us. That doesn\u2019t really matter. What matters is the truth about the history and about this horrible tragedy that happened to humanity during the Second World War. This is something we should always remember. As usual, there has also been some online back and forth on Twitter, particularly around a comment from Russia\u2019s Foreign Affairs Ministry that D-Day \u201cwas not a game changer\u201d for the Second World War. Here\u2019s one take on that tweet: Simon Jenkins has written a piece for the Guardian in which he argues that we now risk drawing the wrong lesson from D-day \u201cstrong alliances and massive armies\u201d are vital to defend freedoms. The dangers to British security now lie a thousand miles from the beaches of Normandy. They lie in digital hacking, the corrupting of democracy and the seduction of proxy wars. These dangers are not met by jet fighters or giant carriers like HMS Queen Elizabeth that muscled in on the Portsmouth celebrations. Britain is not under serious threat. Such risks as it faces demand intelligent policing rather than traditional soldiering. They need brains, not bravery. The truth is that history can be found to teach any lesson you want. But when it is fuelled by the emotions of war it is likely to teach the wrong one. Maybe the memories of past wars ought to insulate us against their repetition. But they do not. We should now put the 20th century behind us, and get stuck into the 21st. Read on Macron went on to address new troops from the French special forces who were present, and who officially received their green berets. Gautier and Macron presented the first berets to the cohort of troops, part of the Commandos Marine, an elite special operations unit of the French Navy. As recently as last month, two of their number were killed during a daring rescue operation that freed four tourists kidnapped in West Africa. Warning the newest recruits during his speech to remain vigilant against the \u201cforces of ignorance\u201d which remained a threat today, Macron had asked the troops to remember that they were \u201cborn\u201d in the sacrifice of the Kieffer commandos of D-Day. Today, on this beach which is at the heart of an epic story, France bows before the 177 heroes of the Kieffer commando and the other veterans of D-Day, Macron added. The president singled out Leon Gautier, one of three surviving commandos and the only one present at the event. Two other survivors were unable to attend. Everyone here remembers Gautier\u2019s friendship with a German veteran of Normandy, Johannes Borner, who he famously embraced in the past. Their friendship symbolised the Franco-German reconciliation, added Macron, who gave a commitment to protect \u201cthe principles\u201d of Gautier. If you\u2019d like to know more about the relationship mentioned by Macron in his speech, here\u2019s a Reuters piece from 2014 about Gautier\u2019s friendship with Borner: Time and understanding have forged a bond between the former French elite commando and the German parachutist from Leipzig, who as neighbors in the Normandy town of Ouistreham celebrated Christmas together in 2012, and will both attend ceremonies next month marking the 70th anniversary of D-Day. \u201cWe\u2019re like brothers now, it\u2019s just great for both of us,\u201d said Boerner, who took French citizenship in 1956 after marrying a local Norman woman. It is one of the vagaries of history that both men live today in the same town where Gautier landed on D-Day, Tommy gun in hand and a year of training under his belt, one of Commander Philippe Kieffer\u2019s 177 French soldiers who battled the machine gun fire, landmines and barbed wire of Sword Beach as part of the No. 4 British Commando unit. Macron has been addressing the event at Colleville - Montgomery, where he has told veterans and others that the Free French \u2018warriors\u2019 who took part in the D-Day operations were a \u201cpowerful symbol.\u201d \u201cThough they were not that many these French heroes were everywhere, pilots, sailors, parachutists landing in Brittany,\u201d he said of the broader French presence during the landings by sea and air. The French \u2018Kieffer\u2019 commandos made progress \u201cagainst all odds\u201d after landing carrying heavy bakcpacks and immediately coming under fire. After hours and hours of combat they neutralised the initial German fortifications and moved on towards Pegasus Bridge. They managed 78 days without being relieved, he added. Macron added that everything relied on \u201ca thread of courage\u201d which started to bring the Nazi occupation of France to an end. Macron has now arrived at a ceremony in Colleville - Montgomery to remember French commandos who were in action on D-Day: The France 24 website has this interesting piece on the Free French \u2018Kieffer\u2019 commando unit, a total of 177 of whom landed on beaches of Normandy: Kieffer, working with General Charles De Gaulle, wanted to create an elite unit like the ones he had seen in Britain. The French marines were sent to Scotland to train with British Special Forces, with some of the training exercises including live rounds. At the end of their training, the French soldiers were rewarded with the famed British green beret, which is reserved for this elite body of soldiers. When the Kieffer Commando\u2019s arrived -- after previous missions -- in Normandy, they were given the honour of firing the first shots in accordance with military tradition. The Guardian\u2019s Caroline Davies has filed this dispatch from Normandy, where she watched earlier as hundreds of veterans, \u201cblue-blazered and with their chest-bars weighted with medals,\u201d sat before the Cross of Sacrifice at Bayeux military cemetery: Their numbers are fewer now. Age is defeating them. But as Royal British Legion standards dipped in respect, and the buglers\u2019 Last Post heralded a two-minute silence broken only by birdsong, they stood, or sat, as straight as their advanced years permitted. Bayeux, the first city to be liberated, is the last resting place of more than 4,100 Commonwealth servicemen. Hundreds of people made clear their gratitude, lining the city\u2019s cobbled streets as veterans made their way to the Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemetery. Read on The French President, Emmanuel Macron, has tweeted his address to veterans earlier in Ver-sur-Mer : \u201cWe know what we owe to you veterans. Our freedom. On behalf of our nation I just want to say thank you\u201d Among the veterans arriving for the service in Arromanches was 93-year-old Harry Billinge, who is on a final pilgrimage to Normandy to see how thousands of pounds he raised is helping the construction of a national memorial honouring his fallen comrades. He handed over more than 10,000 to the Normandy Memorial Trust after relentlessly collecting donations in his local high street and Arromanches. As an 18-year-old Royal Engineer from St Austell in Cornwall, he landed on Gold Beach at 6.30am on June 6 1944 as part of the first wave of troops. Billinge said this was his \u201cswansong\u201d and he did not think he would return again, but he was eager to see the first foundation stones of the monument laid on Thursday morning before the service in Arromanches. Scotland\u2019s First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has tweeted about being present earlier at the service of remembrance at Bayeux Cathedral and a commemorative service at the Commonwealth War Grave Commission\u2019s Bayeux war cemetery. Scottish D-Day veterans who were present included Jack Adamson, 100, from Falkirk said: I lost a few pals, it\u2019s them that should be getting the glory - if that\u2019s the right word.\u201d It does not bear thinking about if you\u2019ve not seen it. (Commemorations like today) are very important, because it lets the younger generations know what the lads went through. The boat we were on did not get into the shore, so they put rope ladders down the side of the ship and we climbed into the sea. It was alright if you were 6ft tall, but I was 5ft 5ins. You had your rifle above your head, your backpack on, you had two live grenades in each pack - it was quite a struggle to get to the beach. D-Day veteran Jack MacMillan, 101, from Edinburgh, who was a major in the Royal Artillery, said he will never forget that day: You\u2019re full of awe, first of all, of what is going on. Then you have moments where a shell just misses you or something and you are grateful to be still here - that it\u2019s one that missed you. At the end of the day, you\u2019re doing a job and the objective is to achieve what you set out to do. The Normandy experience is one that one can never possibly forget. The Scottish Conservative leader, Ruth Davidson has also been remembering: Veterans and others in Arromanches have just been listening to the exhortation to remember the fallen. A bugler then played the last post as flags were lowered, before veterans stepped forward to lay wreaths. On the beach meanwhile, those vehicles which came in to the town earlier have been gathering. Here\u2019s an interesting tweet remembering that it wasn\u2019t just men who landed at Arromanches 75 years ago. Those coming ashore included 60 Free French women\u2019s volunteers who were integrated within the 30th British Army Corps. We shudder to think of what Europe would look like if D-Day had failed, the event in Arromanches has just been told by General Sir Richard Dannatt, the former head of the British Army. He has handed over to the Mayor of the town now is welcoming thousands to its main square. Many of them are veterans who have travelled across the channel in the last couple of days. Many of those in the town are in period dress but there have also been vehicles from the conflict making their way in as well. A service start is about to start in Arromanches, the famous location of the Mulberry Harbours which were towed across the channel. Veterans are due to arrive from the ceremony at Bayeux cemetery. Among those present in Arromanches is Tobias Ellwood, the minister for Defence People and Veterans. This is Ben Quinn picking up the liveblog from Matt. France\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron, has appealed directly to Donald Trump to fulfil the \u201cpromise of Normandy\u201d by embracing pillars of the postwar peace such as the European Union and Nato as the two leaders marked the D-day landings 75 years ago. In a speech that trod a fine diplomatic line, Macron offered both sincere expressions of gratitude for the valour of US troops in the second world war and vehement calls for the White House to re-engage with the principles of multilateralism. Speaking in front of 15,000 people gathered at the American cemetery in Colleville-sur-Mer, the resting place for 9,387 US troops killed in the Normandy campaign, Macron repeatedly name-checked Trump, even at times turning to face the US president who was sitting behind him. Royal Marine Robert Williams, 94, from Chelmsford, gave Theresa May a kiss on the cheek after meeting her in the marquee at Bayeux Cemetery, PA reports. Williams was an 18-year-old commando in a landing craft that reached Sword Beach on D-day. \u201cWe landed ashore and then moved through the land,\u201d he said. \u201cI went all the the way through to Germany and I didn\u2019t get a scratch. The Lord was watching over me.\u201d When asked about his meeting withs May, he said: \u201cShe came over and said \u2018pleased to meet you\u2019. \u201cShe said \u2018thank you for what you have done\u2019. I kissed her - why not? It is not everyone that can do that. \u201cI took her by the arms and gave her a kiss on the cheek. She said \u2018ooh, thank you\u2019.\u201d A parade of British D-day veterans is underway in Arromanches overlooking the Gold beach. The veterans were applauded by the crowd as they arrived. Tobias Ellwood, the minister for Defence People and Veterans, is among those in Arromanches to greet the veterans. At the start of talks with Macron in Caen, Trump stressed that although the US-France relationship might have had its ups and downs in the past, \u201cright now it is outstanding.\u201d Macron added that the allied unity of D-day \u2013 the \u201cpromise of Normandy\u201d - lived on in France and the US\u2019s joint action to \u201cpreserve democracy and freedom\u201d particularly in Africa and the Middle East. He spoke of unbreakable links between the two countries. Before Trump and Macron sat down to 30 minutes of talks alone, both presidents were asked about their differences on how to handle Iran and the nuclear proliferation treaty. Trump said he didn\u2019t think the two countries had difference on Iran. Neither France or the US wanted Iran to have nuclear weapons, he added. He said Iran was once \u201cundisputed champions of terror\u201d adding \u201cthey are not doing that anymore, they are doing very poorly as a nation, they are failing as a nation and I don\u2019t want them to fail as a nation. We can turn that around very quickly.\u201d He said the US sanctions had been \u201cextraordinary in how powerful they had been.\u201d He said I understand they want to talk, that\u2019s fine. \u201cBut they can\u2019t have nuclear weapons and I think the president of France would agree with that very strongly.\u201d Macron added: \u201cWe share the same objectives on Iran. What do we want? First, they don\u2019t get nuclear weapons...Second, we want to reduce their ballistic activity, third, to contain them regionally. The fourth common objective, after all, is peace in the region. We want to deliver those objectives together. That is the point and all the other debates are about technicalities.\u201d On Franco-American relations, Macron said to Trump: I\u2019m always extremely happy to discuss with you in Washington, in Paris or anywhere. We work very closely together, our soldiers work very closely together ... Each time, freedom and democracy is at stake. We work closely together, and we will follow it. So thanks for the friendship, thanks for what your country did for my country. And thanks for what we will do together for both of us and the rest of the world. Thank you. Trump replied: We\u2019ve had great success working together to whether it\u2019s the caliphate, whether it was a couple of other things we did militarily, and you know what I\u2019m talking about, and your military is excellent. My people report back, they say it\u2019s absolutely excellent, but they work very well together. This was a very special day. And I want to thank you for inviting me ... We know what a lot of other people don\u2019t know, we\u2019re doing a lot together. And the relationship between you and I and also France and the United States has been outstanding. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever been maybe as good. It\u2019s been good sometimes and sometimes it hasn\u2019t been, but right now it\u2019s outstanding. So the relationship that we\u2019ve had together has been really terrific. And I appreciate it very much. Thank you, Mr. President. Trump and Macron downplayed their differences on Iran. Trump said: I don\u2019t think we have differences over Iran. I don\u2019t think that the President wants to see nuclear weapons, and neither do I. And that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. He doesn\u2019t want to see them having nuclear weapons. And I don\u2019t want to see them having a nuclear weapons and they won\u2019t have nuclear weapons. With that being said, you know, let\u2019s see what happens with Iran. But when I became president, two and a half years ago, now more, Iran was in a true state of terror. They still are, but they were undisputed champions of terror. And that\u2019s a bad thing. And we had 14 different locations where they were fighting ... between Yemen, Syria, but many other locations and many other battle sites. And it was all about Iran, they were behind every one of them. They\u2019re not doing that anymore. They\u2019re doing very poorly as a nation. They\u2019re failing as a nation, and I don\u2019t want them to fail as a nation. They can, we can turn that around very quickly. But the sanctions have been extraordinary how, how powerful they\u2019ve been. And other things. I understand they want to talk and if they want to talk, that\u2019s fine. We\u2019ll, we\u2019ll talk but the one thing that they can\u2019t have is they can\u2019t have nuclear weapons. And I think the President of France would agree with that very strongly. I think that he would agree that they cannot have nuclear weapons. Macron said: I think we do share the same objectives on Iran, what do we want to do? First, you want to be sure they don\u2019t nuclear weapons. I mean, we had an instrument in 2025, we want to go further and have full certainty on the long run. Second, we want to reduce ballistic activity. And third, we want to contain the regional activities. And we have a fourth common objective: peace in the region. So we have to deliver together this four objectives. This is the point and all the other debates are the technicalities. In order to build that you need to start a negotiation. And I see the word formed by President Trump is that they are very important. We need to open a new negotiation in order to build and to get these four objectives. Trump and Macron have given a press conference in Caen. Trump said he was confident that Brexit will \u201call work out\u201d and said he now feels he knows the Queen very well after spending so many hours with her. Asked about Brexit he said: That\u2019s really going to be between the UK and the European Union. And they\u2019re working very hard. I know they\u2019re working very hard together, it doesn\u2019t seem to be working out. But at some point, something will happen one way or the other, it\u2019ll all work out. But I\u2019m interested to find out how it happens also. Very big will be who\u2019s going to be the new prime minister, over in the UK, that\u2019s going to be a very big thing that\u2019s happening now. So I think before you can think in terms of Brexit, for the next few weeks, you\u2019re gonna have to find out what happens who\u2019s going to be the new leader. And that\u2019s a very interesting situation taking place. I found it to be a very, sort of an amazing period of time, especially having spent so much time with the Queen who I think is an incredible lady. But I spent so much time and, you know, there\u2019s a lot of question marks as to who\u2019s going to be leading. And so it\u2019s very interesting talking to her being with her so many hours, actually, for so many, I feel I know so well. And she certainly knows me very well, right now. But we have a very good relationship also with the United Kingdom. But it\u2019ll all work out. Earlier Trump said: We had a very, very good talk with the United Kingdom and a lot of good talks on trade. And you know what\u2019s going on over there. It\u2019s a complex subject because of Brexit. Nobody knows where it ends up. And I know it\u2019s going to end up very well. Fox News contributor and former Republican presidential candidate, Mike Huckabee, is being widely criticised for this tactless tweet: In his speech, Trump\u2019s reference to the French Resistance - \u201cthese were great people, these were strong people\u201d - is important. The focus of D-day commemorations has traditionally been the bravery of American, British, Canadian and other Allied forces, who land in Nazi-occupied France. Macron has this year sought to put French people back at the heart of a story they had sometimes seemed written out of. There has been a particular focus on telling the stories of the French Resistance\u2019s role in preparing the ground for D-day and thwarting Nazi troops \u2013 including the vital intelligence support, the disinformation campaign to thwart Nazi defence lines and the sabotage of transport and communication lines. Macron had led a commemoration at Caen prison on Wednesday night to mark the \u201cspirit of the Resistance\u201d honouring the memory of 85 French Resistant operatives who had taken part in preparations and were executed just before D-day \u2013 the remains of 20 of them were never found. In the Normandy town of Caen, roads were closed off as Macron and Trump were due to arrive at local government buildings to sit down for 30 minutes of talks alone, followed by a lunch with their diplomatic teams. The French Republican Guard was in place to greet Trump on the red carpet. The two leaders will discuss security, defence and terrorism, including joint military operations in west Africa. Difficult subjects on the table will be Iran and the 2015 nuclear treaty as well as global trade and tariffs. A French official said: \u201cThe aim is for us to restate our positions and to better understand their positions. Macron and Trump departed the ceremony together with their wives at 12:45 PM local, writes White House pool reporter Gabby Orr from Politico. They processed back down the red carpet, stopping halfway down for the 21-gun salute. Luckily, pool had earplugs on hand. The two leaders proceeded down the carpet at the salute\u2019s conclusion, chatting along the way. They made their way to an overlook along the coastline, where they paused for a rendition of Taps and a moment of silence. The two leaders stayed there for several minutes to view a map of the D-Day invasion, which a docent explained to them. Trump listened intently, placing his knuckles on the map as though it were a boardroom table. He and Macron turned around and chatted a bit more as they watched a series of flyovers. Here\u2019s a summary of what\u2019s happened so far: Emmanuel Macron has urged Donald Trump to live up to the promise of Normandy and the values of America\u2019s founding fathers. At a speech at the American cemetery at Colleville-sur-Mer, Macron said: \u201cBeing worthy of the promise of Normandy means never forgetting that free people, when they join forces can surmount any adversity.\u201d He also pointedly praised the UN, Nato and the EU \u2013 all organisations that Trump has criticised. Trump praised America\u2019s \u201cexceptional might\u201d and warned it would \u201cforever be strong\u201d. He said US soldiers who liberated France were \u201csustained by the confidence that America can do anything. The exceptional might came from a truly exceptional spirit.\u201d Macron and Trump presented Legion d\u2019Honneur medals, France\u2019s highest honour, to five American D-day veterans. Speaking in English Macron said: \u201cFor what we owe to you veterans, our freedom, on behalf of my nation, I just want to say thank you.\u201d Ceremonies for the 75th anniversary of D-day began at 7.26am local time when a lone piper marked the minute the invasion began 75 years ago at Arromanches overlooking Gold beach. Pipe Major Trevor Macey-Lillie, of 19th Regiment Royal Artillery performed Highland Laddie as crowds gathered on the beach below. Pope Francis sent a message of thanks to the veterans that was read out at a service at Bayeux cathedral. He said: \u201cI express the hope that this commemoration event will allow all the generations in Europe, and the whole world, to strongly reassert that peace is based on the respect of each person, whatever his or her background.\u201d Theresa May paid tribute to the sense of duty shown by those who took part in the Normandy landings at a service at Ver-Sur-Mer. In one of her last duties as prime minister she said: \u201cThey didn\u2019t boast, they didn\u2019t fuss, they served. They did their duty, as they laid down their lives, so that we might have a better life and build a better world.\u201d Macron thanked May for the work she had done as prime minister. \u201cWe can be proud of the results achieved,\u201d he told her. A difference in style emerged at end of the ceremony at the American cemetery in Colleville-sur-Mer, Normandy. After the respective speeches, the Macrons threw themselves into the crowd of veterans sitting behind them to shake hands and listen to stories. The Trumps meanwhile offered only a few handshakes before standing to the side of the stage to wait for the French President and his wife to finish. The Trumps were left waiting for some time before both couples walked down to a point in the cemetery directly overlooking Omaha beach. While the speeches from both Macron and Trump stressed their respective countries\u2019 gratitude to those who fought in D-day and the wider Normandy campaign, the French president\u2019s comments were overly political. At times he appeared to be directly appealing to Trump to live up to the \u2018promise of Normandy\u2019 and even the values of the founding fathers of the USA. He said: \u201cDear Donald Trump, the United States is never greater than when it is fighting for the freedom of others. \u201cThe United States of America is never greater than when it shows its loyalty. Loyalty to the universal values that the founding fathers defended, when nearly two and a half centuries ago France came to support its independence. \u201cWhat we owe you is to show ourselves worthy of the heritage of peace that you have left us. \u201cBeing worthy of the promise of Normandy means never forgetting that free people, when they join forces can surmount any adversity.\u201d Trump was repeatedly name checked in a speech that made reference to the European Union and Nato, both objects of criticism from the US president, as part of the legacy to be protected. Macron said: We shall never cease to perpetuate the alliance of free peoples. That is what the victorious sides did, when they created the United Nations, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. That is what a few years later the leaders of Europe did in bringing about the European Union. The lessons of Colleville-sur-mer are clear: liberty and democracy are inseparable.\u201d Trump ended his speech by praising America\u2019s \u201cexceptional might\u201d and how the US will \u201cforever be strong\u201d. He said: They battled not for control and domination. But for liberty, democracy and self rule. They pressed on for love, home and country, the main streets, the school yards, the churches, and neighbours, the families and communities that gave us men such as these. They were sustained by the confidence that America can do anything. Because we are a noble nation, with a virtuous people praying to a righteous God. The exceptional might came from a truly exceptional spirit. The abundance of courage came from an abundance of faith. The great deeds of an army came from the great depths of their love. As they confronted their faith, the Americans and the allies placed themselves into the palm of God\u2019s hand. The men behind me will tell you that they are just the lucky ones. As one of them recently put it all the heroes are buried here. But we know what these men did. We knew how brave they were. They came here and saved freedom. And then they went home and showed us all what freedom is all about. The American sons and daughters who saw us to victory were no less extraordinary in peace. They build families. They built industries. They built a national culture that inspired the entire world. In the decades that followed, America defeated Communism, secured civil rights, revolutionise science, launched a man to the moon, and then kept on pushing to new frontiers. And today, America is stronger than ever before. Seven decades ago, the warriors of the day fought a sinister enemy who spoke of 1,000 year Empire. in defeating that evil, they left a legacy that will last not only for 1,000 years, but for all time. For as long as the soul knows of duty and honour, for as long as freedom keeps its hold on the human heart. For the men who sit behind me, and to the boys who rest in the field before me. Your examples will never, ever grow old. Your Spirit, brave, unyielding and true, will never die. The blood that they spilled, the tears that they shed. The lives that they gave the sacrifice that they made, did not just win a battle. It did not just win a war. Those who fought here won a future for our nation. They won the survival of our civilization. And they showed us the way to love, cherish and defend our way of life for many centuries to come. Today as we stand together upon this sacred earth we pledge that our nation will forever be strong and united. We will forever ever be together. Our people will forever be bold. Our hearts will forever be loyal. And our children and their children will forever and always be free. May God bless our great veterans. May God bless our allies. May God bless the heroes of D-day. And may God bless America. Meanwhile, a service has begun at the Commonwealth cemetery in Bayeux. Prince Charles and Theresa May are among the those attending. Trump continued by highlighting the contributions of individual soldiers. This beach, code named Omaha, was defended by the Nazis with monstrous fire power, thousands and thousands of mines and spikes driven into the sand so deeply. It was here that tens of thousands of the Americans came. The GIs who boarded the landing craft that morning knew that they carried on their shoulders not just the pack of a soldier but the fate of the world. Colonel George Taylor, whose 16th InfantryRegiment would join in the first wave, was asked, \u201cWhat would happen if the Germans stopped? Right then and there, stopped them, what would happen?\u201d The great American replied: \u201cThe 18th infantry is coming in behind. The 26th Infantry will come on too. Then there is the 2ndInfantry Division already afloat. And the 9th Division and the 3rd Armoured and all the rest. Maybe the 16th won\u2019t make it but someone will.\u201d One of those men in Taylor\u2019s 16th Regiment was army medic Ray Lambert. Ray was only 23 but he had already earned three Purple Hearts fighting in North Africa, where he and his brother Bill served side-by-side. In the early morning hours, the two brothers stood together on the deck after the USS Enricho before boarding two separate Higgins landing craft. If \u201cif I don\u2019t make it\u201d, Bill said, \u201cPlease, please take care of my family.\u201d Ray asked his brother to do the same. Of the 31 men on Ray\u2019s landing craft, only Ray and six others made it to the beach. There were only a few of them left. They came to the sector right here below us. Easy Red it was called. Again and again Ray ran back into the water. He dragged out one man after another. He was shot through the arm, his leg was ripped open by shrapnel, his back was broken, he nearly drowned. He had been on the beach for hours bleeding and saving lives when he finally lost consciousness. He woke up the next day on a cot beside another badly-wounded soldier. He looked over and saw his brother Bill. They made it. They made it. They made it.At 98 years old, Ray is here with us today with his fourth Purple Heart and his third Silver Star from Omaha. Ray, the free world salutes you! Trump adds: Our debt to you is ever lasting. Today we express our undying gratitude. When you were young, these men enlisted their lives in a great crusade. One of the greatest of all times. Their mission is the story of an epic battle and the ferocious eternal struggle between good and evil. On 6 June1944, they joined a liberation force of awesome power and breath-taking scale. After months of planning, the Allies had chosen this ancient coastline to mount their campaign to vanquish the wicked tyranny of the Nazi empire from the face of the earth. The battle began in the skies above us, in those first tense midnight hours, 1,000 aircraft roared overhead with 17,000 Allied airborne troops preparing to leap into the darkness beyond these trees. Then came dawn. The enemy, who had occupied these heights, saw the largest naval armada in the history of the world. Just a few miles offshore were 7,000 vessels bearing 130,000 warriors. They were the citizens of free and independent nations united by their duty to their compatriots into millions yet unborn. There were the British, whose nobility and fortitude saw them through the worst of Dunkirk and the London Blitz, the full violence of Nazi fury was no match for the full grandeur of British pride. There were the Canadians whose robust sense of honour and loyalty compelled them to take up arms alongside Britain from the very, very beginning. There were the fighting Poles, the tough Norwegians and the intrepid Aussies. There were the gallant French commandos, soon to be met by thousands of their brave countrymen ready to write a new chapter in the long history of French valour. Finally, there were the Americans. They came from the farms of a vast heartland, the streets of glowing cities and the forges of mighty industrial towns. Trump opens his speech with this: On this day 75 years ago 10,000 men shed their blood and thousands sacrificed their lives for their brothers, for their countries and for the survival of liberty. Today we remember those who fell and we honour all who fought right here in Normandy. They won back this ground for civilisation. Veterans of the Second World War who join us today, you are among the very greatest Americans who will ever live. You are the pride of our nation. You are the glory of our Republic and we thank you from the bottom of our hearts. Macron and Trump have presented Legion d\u2019Honneur medals, France\u2019s highest honour, to five American D-day veterans. Macron paid tribute to the allied forces who liberated France. Speaking through a translator, he said: \u201cToday France has not forgotten those fighters for whom we owe our freedom. On behalf of France I bow down in front of their bravery. I bow down to our veterans and I say thank you.\u201d In a brief passage in English he said: \u201cWe know what we owe to you, veterans: our freedom. On behalf our our nation I just want to say thank you.\u201d Macron then joined in the applause. The \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace is live streaming the ceremony. We\u2019re still waiting for the start of the ceremony at Colleville-sur-Mer. Once again Emmanuel Macron is running a bit late. Live footage from the cemetery showed the French president, and his wife Brigitte, arriving by helicopter. They were greeted by Donald and Melania Trump. Marine One has arrived at the US cemetery at Colleville-sur-Mer. The last time Emmanuel Macron and Donald Trump met in France for a major historical event \u2013 the world war one armistice commemorations in Paris last November \u2014 the atmosphere turned sour. At that event, US president had bristled as he sat listening to Macron deliver a speech lambasting nationalism at the Arc de Triomphe. Macron \u2013 who is the same age as Trump\u2019s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr \u2014 had made implicit criticism of Trump\u2019s personal brand of \u201cAmerica First\u201d nationalism, leaving the US president irked. A few days later, back in Washington, Trump launched an early morning Twitter storm against Macron, mocking him for \u201cvery low approval ratings\u201d and saying Parisians had started to learn German during the second world war before the US saved them from occupation. Macron\u2019s office now stresses that the two presidents\u2019 relationship remains \u201crespectful\u201d and strong. There has since been \u201ca lot of water under the bridge\u201d, a French official said, adding that the two presidents have continued to speak regularly by phone in recent months, including Trump\u2019s call to offer support after the Notre Dame cathedral fire in Paris. A message from Pope France is read out in French and English at the start of the service at Bayeux Cathedral. The Pope\u2019s message, read by Cardinal Marc Ouellet, said: Normandy was decisive in in the fight against a Nazi barbarism, and it paved the way to the end of that war. War which deeply ravaged Europe and the world. That\u2019s why I make a grateful memorial of all the soldiers who coming from several countries, France included, were brave to join the army and give their lives for freedom and peace. I confide in God\u2019s merciful love these soldiers, as well as the millions of victims not forgetting those who, on the German side, fought obediently to a system of government motivated by a deadly ideology. I express the hope that this commemoration event will allow all the generations in Europe and the whole world to strongly reassert that peace is based on the respect of each person, whatever his or her background, on respect for the law and the common good, on respect for the environment entrusted to our care and for the richness of the moral tradition inherited from the past. And I ask God to help the Christians of all faith, those who have other religious beliefs as well as people of goodwill to promote a genuine worldwide brotherhood, fostering a culture of encounter and dialogue helpful with the weakest and the poor. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has arrived at the Bayeux Cathedral service of remembrance. He is accompanied by shadow foreign secretary and shadow defence secretary Nia Griffith. Prince Charles and Theresa May are also at the service. In his speech Trump will say American and allied forces who stormed the beaches of Normandy \u201cwon back this ground for civilisation\u201d, AP reports. Trump is gathering with other world leaders at The Normandy American Cemetery to honour those who died and participated in the battle that turned the course of the war. In excerpts from the speech he will deliver, Trump will describe the 130,000 service members who participated in the invasion as the \u201ccitizens of free and independent nations, united by their duty to their compatriots and to millions yet unborn.\u201d He will also assure allies that \u201cour bond is unbreakable.\u201d Trump says of the service members who participated in D-Day that their exceptional might came from an exceptional spirit. Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament\u2019s Brexit coordinator, has this: President Trump has tweeted a video featuring testimony from US veterans of D-day. The stunning American cemetery in Colleville-sur-Mer, Normandy, where some 9,000 graves overlook Omaha beach is the location for the big commemorative event of the day in France . Around 15,000 people will join president Emmanuel Macron and president Donald Trump for a service and flyover of US and French jets. There are 170 second world war veterans here, including 35 men who trod on the beaches of Normandy on 6 June 1944, as the allies launched the largest amphibious assault in history. Omaha beach, just down the bluffs from the cemetery, was the scene of the bloodiest fighting. Of the 43,250 landed on 6 June, there were some 3,000 casualties as man of the 13,000 bombs dropped by the US Eighth Air Force to destroy the German defences had in fact harmlessly cascaded into the hedgerows well behind the beach and its machine gun posts. Trump is due to arrive in Marine One at 9.45am (BST) followed by Macron 15 minutes later. There will be an honour guard followed by an invocation by a military chaplain. The French president will speak before bestowing the L\u00e9gion d\u2019honneur on five veterans of the D Day landings. Trump will then speak ahead of a laying of wreaths and a 21 gun salute. The two men and their wives will move to a point directly overlooking the beach where there will be a minute of silence ahead of the joint flyover by US and French fighter jets. Veterans and their families are arriving for a service of remembrance at Bayeux Cathedral. They will be joined by Theresa May, and the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall and Scotland\u2019s first minister Nicola Sturgeon. May pointedly paid tribute to the sense of duty shown by those who took part in the Normandy landings. She said: These young men belonged to a very special generation, the greatest generation, a generation whose unconquerable spirit shaped our post war world. They didn\u2019t boast, they didn\u2019t fuss, they served. They did their duty, as they laid down their lives, so that we might have a better life and build a better world. The memorial that will be built here will remind us of this, of the service and sacrifice of those who fell under British command in Normandy of the price paid by French civilians, and our duty and our responsibility to now carry the torch for freedom, for peace and for democracy. I want to thank all those involved in this memorial. May added: It is incredibly moving to be here today. Looking out across beaches where one of the greatest battles for freedom this world has ever known, took place. And it is truly humbling to do so with the men who were there that day. It is an honour for all of us to share this moment with you. Standing here as the waves wash quietly onto the shore below us, it\u2019s almost impossible to grasp the roar courage, it must have taken that day to leap from landing craft and into the surf despite the fury of battle. No one could be certain what the 6th of June would bring. No one would know how this the most ambitious, amphibious and airborne assault in all of human history would turn out. And as the sun rose that morning, not one of the troops on the landing craft approaching these shores, not one of the pilots in the skies above, not one of the sailors at sea, knew whether they would still be alive when the sun set once again. If one day can be said to have determined the fate of generations to come in France, in Britain, in Europe, and the world that day, was the 6th June 1944. More than 156,000 men landed on D-day, of which 83,000 We\u2019re from Britain under the Commonwealth. Over a quarter million more supported operations from air and sea. While the French Resistance carried out extra ordinary acts of bravery behind enemy lines. Many were terribly wounded, and many made the ultimate sacrifice that day. And in the fierce fighting that followed. As together, our allied nations sought to release Europe from the grip of fascism ... Here in Normandy, the names of those British men and women who gave their lives in defence of freedom will forever sit opposite their homeland across the channel, along with those of our allies. Here in Normandy, we will always remember their courage, their commitment, their conviction, and to our veterans here in Normandy today. I want to say the only words we can: thank you. In his speech Macron paid tribute to May on one of her last official engagements as prime minister. Speaking through a translator he said: On a more personal level may I say to Theresa May how much friendship I feel for her and what a pleasure it\u2019s been to work in confidence and trust with her. Leaders come and go. But the work they do continues and the power of our link goes beyond the events of a given moment. And dear Theresa May I believe that we can be proud of the work we\u2019ve done together. The causes we\u2019ve supported together in our two countries and internationally. We can be proud of the results achieved. This memorial is not the least example of it. Long a friendship between our two different countries. And thank you to all those men and women who fought so that the fresh soil could once again be free. Macron also talked of the lasting bonds between France and the UK despite the \u201cdebates of the present\u201d. He said This monument will be a great symbol of the significant links between our two nations: France and the UK. Nothing will erase this, nothing will ever take away those links built of blood spilled and shared values. The debates of the present, in no way takeaway from the past. On the contrary, from this power of our shared, past and common future. Always with the Prime Minister, we have ensured that the relationship between our two countries should be under the seal of confidence, friendship. And we I will always continue along that path. Because our history goes beyond us, because our veterans force us to this. Breaking into English he said: \u201cWe owe our freedom to our veterans, we will never surrender. And whatever it takes, we will always stand together. Because this is our common destiny.\u201d For the pro-European French president Emmanuel Macron, today\u2019s D-day commemorations in Normandy are about stressing the importance of modern multilateralism, peace-building and \u201cEurope-building\u201d. Macron\u2019s early morning ceremony with the prime minister Theresa May to launch the construction of a British memorial at Ver-sur-Mer is intended to show how cooperation between London and Paris, particularly on defence and military issues, will always be strong despite Brexit. A source close to the president said the ceremony would illustrate \u201cthe strength of French-British friendship and joint engagement, whatever the context.\u201d At the Elys\u00e9e it was seen as symbolic that one of May\u2019s last official engagements as prime minister will be at Ver-sur-Mer. When May and Macron held their first meeting after he was elected president in 2017, May had raised the issue of building this memorial at Ver-sur-Mer and they had both agreed at the time that the project had to be ready to start construction on the 75th anniversary of D-day. Macron has arrived (a little late) at Ver-sur-Mer and was greeted by May. The two leaders chatted together as they walked to where veterans have gathered for the start of the ceremony. Macron and May shook hands with some of the veterans. Theresa May has arrived for the start of the ceremony at Ver-sur-Mer on the Normandy coast, close to Gold beach. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, is due to join her in the next few minutes. Earlier defence secretary, Penny Mordaunt, joined veterans at the ceremony. D-day veteran, Harry Billinge, is making a final pilgrimage to Normandy to see how thousands of pounds he has raised is helping the construction of a national memorial honouring his fallen comrades, PA reports. Billinge managed to raise more than \u00a310,000 for the Normandy Memorial Trust by relentlessly collecting donations in St Austell high street near his home. The 93-year-old has become a local celebrity in the Cornish town where he says market days - and the summer when tourists flock to the area - are particularly prosperous. As an 18-year-old Royal Engineers soldier, he landed on Gold Beach at 6.30am on 6 June 1944 as part of the first wave of troops to arrive in Normandy for the operation. Billinge said: \u201cWhen I went over to Normandy it made a big impression on me that I am unable to forget today. I wanted to help all the fellas that never came back. When I heard about the monument I thought \u2018This is what I\u2019ve been kept for - to collect for that\u2019.\u201d \u201cI had to do that, it was a must.I shan\u2019t be going again I don\u2019t think. This is my swansong.\u201d The memorial will pay tribute to more than 20,000 members of the British armed forces who died in Normandy in the summer of 1944. Billinge will lay wreaths as part of an inauguration event attended by Prime Minister Theresa May and French President Emmanuel Macron. A sculpture created by David Williams-Ellis will be unveiled during the event, marking the beginning of construction.Anticipated to be completed within a year, it is being built on a hillside in Ver-sur-Mer overlooking Gold Beach and will include a roll of honour of the names of 22,442 members of the British armed forces who died in the D-Day landings and Battle of Normandy. Donald Trump is looking forward to \u201ca big and beautiful day\u201d The weather forecast for Normandy is good, which means Trump is likely to turn up this time. Last November he skipped a ceremony at Aisne-Marne American Cemetery, attended by Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel, because of rain. The anniversary marked the moment American and French troops repelled the Germans in 1918. The French daily Liberation has accuses the American and British government\u2019s of hypocrisy and of turning their backs on the principles of international cooperation celebrated at the commemorations in Portsmouth. It says Donald Trump is constantly fighting against multilateralism and trying to weaken the European Union. It adds that the UK which came to the rescue of occupied Europe now seeks to detach itself from the EU. The Guardian\u2019s Martin Kettle has similar concerns: The uneasy relationship between Wednesday\u2019s major commemorations at Portsmouth and those that will take place on Thursday in France illustrates Britain\u2019s change of stance. In recent decades, Normandy has overwhelmingly been the main place to commemorate D-day. But now here is Britain mounting a large parallel event. Fair enough, in one sense. Britain was the base from which the war in the west was won. It is easier for the 90-year-olds to get to Portsmouth than France. But it is also as though Britain is choosing to reassert a closed-off version of its own national wartime myth alongside \u2013 and even in opposition to \u2013 the previously more established international one. Welcome to live coverage of ceremonies to mark the 75th anniversary of D-day. Attention switches from Portsmouth to Normandy as veterans of Operation Overlord gather on the northern French coast as they 75 years ago today. They will be accompanied by world leaders including Donald Trump, Emmanuel Macron, and Theresa May on her penultimate day as leader of the Conservative party. The ceremonies began at 7.26am local time when a lone piper marked the minute the invasion began 75 years ago at Arromanches overlooking Gold beach. Pipe Major Trevor Macey-Lillie, of 19th Regiment Royal Artillery (The Scottish Gunners) performed Highland Laddie as crowds gathered on the beach below him and lined the promenade, applauding his performance. Here\u2019s a timetable for the rest of the day (all times BST): 8am: May and Macron will attend the inauguration of a memorial to British servicemen at Ver-sur-Mer, overlooking Gold Beach. 9am: a UK remembrance service begins at Bayeux Cathedral. 10am: The main event of the day will see Trump and Macron give speeches at the American cemetery at Colleville-sur-Mer where over 9,000 graves overlook Omaha beach. The French president will also bestow the Legion d\u2019Honneur, France\u2019s highest honour, on five American veterans. 11am: Prince Charles will attend a service at the Commonwealth War Graves Commission at Bayeux. Later there will be a march of some of D-day veterans. While others will reenact more parachute jumps onto Normandy soil. 12.30pm: Trump and Macron will hold bilateral talks and lunch at Caen. 3pm: The start of the French ceremony at Colleville-Montgomery. 5.30pm: Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau will attend a ceremony at Juno beach, where Canadian forces were in charge of the assault. Our correspondents Daniel Boffey, Angelique Chrisafis and Caroline Davies will be providing updates from various ceremonies throughout the day.",

It has found the number of people aged 25 to 34 starting a new job and moving home has fallen 40% over the last two decades.</p> \n<p>A person on average earnings in Scarborough paying average rent would have been 29% better off by moving to Leeds in 1997. In 2018, rising rents and stagnant wages mean the benefit is 4%. Moving from Sunderland to York in 1997 would have been worth a 6% rise in earnings after rent, but would now result in a 24% fall.</p> \n<p>The phenomenon is not just affecting the young.

The findings come alongside Affordable Housing Commission research that 43% of all renters are facing affordability problems and 5.5 million are unable to buy their own home.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>D-day anniversary \u2013 </strong>World leaders will attend ceremonies today on the beaches of Normandy, where 75 years ago <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/06/d-day-anniversary-trump-macron-normandy-beaches\">Allied troops landed to push Nazi forces out of France</a>. On an occasion that will mix politics with poignant historical remembrance, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, will first meet Theresa May to launch the construction of a British memorial at Ver-sur-Mer. Macron and Donald Trump will hold private talks followed by a working lunch after a ceremony at the US military cemetery at Colleville-sur-Mer. The site overlooking Omaha beach holds 9,400 graves \u2013 representing 40% of the American forces killed during the weeks of fighting that followed the D-day landings.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"2dccf70f-f4ea-4788-b8ab-5bbe3fb542fa\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VMyrYpWpthk?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Tens of thousands of French and foreign visitors have converged on the Normandy coast for this year\u2019s commemorations to honour the dwindling number of firsthand witnesses to the fighting. Justin Trudeau will attend a ceremony at Juno beach, where Canadian forces were in charge of the assault. On 6 June 1944, now known as the \u201clongest day\u201d, 156,000 troops landed on the beaches chosen for the D-day invasion, most of them American, British and Canadian. It remains the largest amphibious assault in history, claiming the lives of an estimated 4,400 troops in the first day alone.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Bad news for Bridgend \u2013 </strong>Ford is planning to close its Bridgend engine plant in Wales, with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/05/ford-planning-to-close-bridgend-plant-more-than-1500-jobs-at-risk\">likely loss of about 1,700 jobs</a>. The announcement is expected today at the plant, which has been making engines since 1980. Cost-cutting by Ford across Europe, the end of the plant\u2019s contract to make engines for Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), and of course Brexit are thought to be factors in the decision. Honda has announced the closure of its Swindon plant in 2021 while Nissan has scrapped plans to built its X-Trail model at Sunderland. JLR, Britain\u2019s biggest carmaker, is also cutting jobs. The Unite union is due to meet with Ford management this morning.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Trump tramples Troubles \u2013 </strong>Donald Trump has managed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/05/ireland-visit-donald-trump-arrives-leo-varadkar-discussions\">compare Ireland\u2019s post-Brexit border dilemma to the US border with Mexico</a>. The US president, sitting next to a visibly uncomfortable taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said: \u201cI think it will all work out very well, and also for you with your wall, your border.\u201d Varadkar interjected that Ireland wished to avoid a border or a wall. \u201cI think you do, I think you do,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe way it works now is good, you want to try and to keep it that way.\u201d The awkward meeting at Shannon airport took part amid a heavy police and security presence in Ireland with the visit by Trump, unpopular in the country, the subject of protests in Shannon and Dublin. Today, Trump will travel to France for D-day commemorations before returning to his currently barricaded golf and hotel resort in Doonbeg, County Clare, and then going home.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Centre-left to lead Danish government \u2013 </strong>Denmark\u2019s Social Democrats have claimed victory in parliamentary elections with 25.9% of the vote. The centre-right Liberals of outgoing prime minister Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen reached 23.4% while the populist, far-right Danish People\u2019s party (DPP) plunged to 8.7% \u2013 less than half their tally in the last election. The Social Democrat-led \u201cred bloc\u201d of leftist parties <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/05/centre-left-social-democrats-set-to-win-in-denmark-elections\">won 91 seats in the 179-seat Folketing</a>, against 75 for Rasmussen\u2019s rival \u201cblue bloc\u201d. Mette Frederiksen, leader of the centre-left Social Democrats, says she intends to form a minority government with ad hoc support of other parties.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5e6a81880f8d0f19cac863c258ef92aef84ba9ea\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e6a81880f8d0f19cac863c258ef92aef84ba9ea/0_64_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mette Frederiksen, leader of Denmark\u2019s opposition Social Democrats.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mette Frederiksen, leader of Denmark\u2019s opposition Social Democrats.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ritzau Scanpix/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Denmark\u2019s mainstream parties have in recent years adopted hardline anti-immigration policies previously the preserve of the far right. Frederiksen has defended her party\u2019s backing for many of the restrictive immigration measures passed by the outgoing government, mostly instigated and supported by the DPP. Most of the other \u201cred bloc\u201d parties do not back the Social Democrats\u2019 immigration policies, so coalition-making looks tricky.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Surrogacy reform overdue \u2013 </strong>Laws governing surrogacy should be updated to allow intended parents to assume the status of legal parents as soon as a baby is born, rather than having to wait months, according to the law commissions of England, Wales and Scotland. Their consultation recommends ending the requirement for intended parents to have a genetic link to the child. Profit-seeking surrogacy agencies should remain banned, the commission\u2019s report suggests, while calling for public views on surrogacy payments. The consultation also calls for a national register allowing those born through surrogacy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jun/06/campaigners-call-reforms-surrogacy-laws\">access to information about their conception</a>. Current surrogacy laws are unchanged since the 1980s.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Fish and scripts \u2013 </strong>The Cornish fishing village of Mevagissey is looking for a new GP. Dr Katherine James has announced she will be handing back her contract to run the local surgery on 31 July and it is feared 5,300 patients will be forced to travel elsewhere for treatment.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"66c416c7ed2772a471ebacee968be66cb8ecee9e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66c416c7ed2772a471ebacee968be66cb8ecee9e/0_321_4903_2942/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dr Marlene Behennah, who was Mevagissey\u2019s GP for 30 years.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dr Marlene Behennah, who was Mevagissey\u2019s GP for 30 years.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Wileman/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The town has launched a campaign \u2013 hashtag #willyoubemygp \u2013 aiming to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/06/cornish-village-mevagissey-hopes-to-charm-a-new-gp-into-taking-over-practice\">woo doctors with picturesque, winding streets, friendly folk and superior fish and chips</a>. In a campaign video posted on the Cornwall Channel, a crowd of residents chant: \u201cBe our GP. We are a lovely community. We need you.\u201d Dr Marlene Behennah, Mevagissey-born and a doctor at the surgery for 30 years until 2002, said she was \u201cvery very sad\u201d the surgery might close. \u201cI mean, this is my life\u2019s work.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Today in Focus podcast: China\u2019s other Tiananmen Squares</h2> \n<p>Lily Kuo, the Guardian\u2019s Beijing bureau chief, discusses reporting on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2019/jun/06/china-other-tiananmens-podcast\">hundreds of other Chinese cities that were involved in the student protests in 1989</a>. And: Patrick Wintour on Saudi Arabia\u2019s involvement in Sudan\u2019s military crackdown.</p> \n<h2>Lunchtime read: Lies, damned lies and economics</h2> \n<p>The familiar political explanation for rising economic inequality is the huge shift in economic and political thinking, in favour of free markets, during the reigns of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. It fits the facts \u2013 across developed economies, the biggest rise in inequality since 1945 occurred in the US and UK from 1980 onwards.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3c01bc61a480aed05daf15c51da28aa61f36d5b7\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c01bc61a480aed05daf15c51da28aa61f36d5b7/224_333_5000_3001/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Economics line graph\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p>But that explanation, writes Jonathan Aldred, is too top-down: it is all about what politicians and other elites do to us, and looks like a convenient myth that lets us avoid thinking about another possibility: that through our electoral choices and decisions in daily life <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2019/jun/06/socialism-for-the-rich-the-evils-of-bad-economics\">we have supported rising inequality, or at least acquiesced in it</a>. \u201cInequality is unlikely to fall much in the future unless our attitudes turn unequivocally against it. Among other things, we will need to accept that how much people earn in the market is often not what they deserve, and that the tax they pay is not taking from what is rightfully theirs.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Sport</h2> \n<p>English football lurched back to the bad old days on Wednesday night when hundreds of supporters were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/05/england-fans-baton-charged-portugese-police-nations-league-porto\">baton-charged by riot police</a> after hurling bottles and goading officers at a fan zone in Porto.

And Johanna Konta, the British No 1, can reach her first grand slam final with victory in Paris on Friday but even if she fails she is enjoying her tennis again and believes that is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/05/johanna-konta-calm-mantra-french-open-semi-final\">the reason for her resurgence</a>.</p> \n<h2>Business</h2> \n<p>Japan\u2019s Nikkei has eked out some small gains overnight as Asian markets were hampered by concerns about the US trade rows with Mexico and China, prompting investors to buy domestic-demand oriented shares. Mexican and American officials claimed progress in White House talks late on Wednesday but Donald Trump declared it was \u201cnot nearly enough\u201d to halt the import taxes he wants to impose if the flow of migrants to America\u2019s southern border is not addressed. The IMF managing director, Christine Lagarde, has told Reuters that escalating tariff threats are sapping business and market confidence, and could slow growth that is currently expected to improve next year.

The site overlooking Omaha beach holds 9,400 graves \u2013 representing 40% of the American forces killed during the weeks of fighting that followed the D-day landings. Tens of thousands of French and foreign visitors have converged on the Normandy coast for this year\u2019s commemorations to honour the dwindling number of firsthand witnesses to the fighting. Justin Trudeau will attend a ceremony at Juno beach, where Canadian forces were in charge of the assault. On 6 June 1944, now known as the \u201clongest day\u201d, 156,000 troops landed on the beaches chosen for the D-day invasion, most of them American, British and Canadian. It remains the largest amphibious assault in history, claiming the lives of an estimated 4,400 troops in the first day alone. * * * Bad news for Bridgend \u2013 Ford is planning to close its Bridgend engine plant in Wales, with the likely loss of about 1,700 jobs. The announcement is expected today at the plant, which has been making engines since 1980. Cost-cutting by Ford across Europe, the end of the plant\u2019s contract to make engines for Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), and of course Brexit are thought to be factors in the decision. Honda has announced the closure of its Swindon plant in 2021 while Nissan has scrapped plans to built its X-Trail model at Sunderland. JLR, Britain\u2019s biggest carmaker, is also cutting jobs. The Unite union is due to meet with Ford management this morning. * * * Trump tramples Troubles \u2013 Donald Trump has managed to compare Ireland\u2019s post-Brexit border dilemma to the US border with Mexico. The US president, sitting next to a visibly uncomfortable taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said: \u201cI think it will all work out very well, and also for you with your wall, your border.\u201d Varadkar interjected that Ireland wished to avoid a border or a wall. \u201cI think you do, I think you do,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe way it works now is good, you want to try and to keep it that way.\u201d The awkward meeting at Shannon airport took part amid a heavy police and security presence in Ireland with the visit by Trump, unpopular in the country, the subject of protests in Shannon and Dublin. Today, Trump will travel to France for D-day commemorations before returning to his currently barricaded golf and hotel resort in Doonbeg, County Clare, and then going home. * * * Centre-left to lead Danish government \u2013 Denmark\u2019s Social Democrats have claimed victory in parliamentary elections with 25.9% of the vote. The centre-right Liberals of outgoing prime minister Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen reached 23.4% while the populist, far-right Danish People\u2019s party (DPP) plunged to 8.7% \u2013 less than half their tally in the last election. The Social Democrat-led \u201cred bloc\u201d of leftist parties won 91 seats in the 179-seat Folketing, against 75 for Rasmussen\u2019s rival \u201cblue bloc\u201d. Mette Frederiksen, leader of the centre-left Social Democrats, says she intends to form a minority government with ad hoc support of other parties. Denmark\u2019s mainstream parties have in recent years adopted hardline anti-immigration policies previously the preserve of the far right. Frederiksen has defended her party\u2019s backing for many of the restrictive immigration measures passed by the outgoing government, mostly instigated and supported by the DPP. Most of the other \u201cred bloc\u201d parties do not back the Social Democrats\u2019 immigration policies, so coalition-making looks tricky. * * * Surrogacy reform overdue \u2013 Laws governing surrogacy should be updated to allow intended parents to assume the status of legal parents as soon as a baby is born, rather than having to wait months, according to the law commissions of England, Wales and Scotland. Their consultation recommends ending the requirement for intended parents to have a genetic link to the child. Profit-seeking surrogacy agencies should remain banned, the commission\u2019s report suggests, while calling for public views on surrogacy payments. The consultation also calls for a national register allowing those born through surrogacy access to information about their conception. Current surrogacy laws are unchanged since the 1980s. * * * Fish and scripts \u2013 The Cornish fishing village of Mevagissey is looking for a new GP. Dr Katherine James has announced she will be handing back her contract to run the local surgery on 31 July and it is feared 5,300 patients will be forced to travel elsewhere for treatment. The town has launched a campaign \u2013 hashtag #willyoubemygp \u2013 aiming to woo doctors with picturesque, winding streets, friendly folk and superior fish and chips. In a campaign video posted on the Cornwall Channel, a crowd of residents chant: \u201cBe our GP. We are a lovely community. We need you.\u201d Dr Marlene Behennah, Mevagissey-born and a doctor at the surgery for 30 years until 2002, said she was \u201cvery very sad\u201d the surgery might close. \u201cI mean, this is my life\u2019s work.\u201d Today in Focus podcast: China\u2019s other Tiananmen Squares Lily Kuo, the Guardian\u2019s Beijing bureau chief, discusses reporting on the hundreds of other Chinese cities that were involved in the student protests in 1989. And: Patrick Wintour on Saudi Arabia\u2019s involvement in Sudan\u2019s military crackdown. Lunchtime read: Lies, damned lies and economics The familiar political explanation for rising economic inequality is the huge shift in economic and political thinking, in favour of free markets, during the reigns of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. It fits the facts \u2013 across developed economies, the biggest rise in inequality since 1945 occurred in the US and UK from 1980 onwards. But that explanation, writes Jonathan Aldred, is too top-down: it is all about what politicians and other elites do to us, and looks like a convenient myth that lets us avoid thinking about another possibility: that through our electoral choices and decisions in daily life we have supported rising inequality, or at least acquiesced in it. \u201cInequality is unlikely to fall much in the future unless our attitudes turn unequivocally against it. Among other things, we will need to accept that how much people earn in the market is often not what they deserve, and that the tax they pay is not taking from what is rightfully theirs.\u201d Sport English football lurched back to the bad old days on Wednesday night when hundreds of supporters were baton-charged by riot police after hurling bottles and goading officers at a fan zone in Porto. Meanwhile, Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s two late goals, added to a first-half effort, gave Portugal a 3-1 win in the Nations League semi-final after Switzerland. Eden Hazard is set to join Real Madrid after the Spanish club and Chelsea agreed a fee in the region of \u20ac100m (\u00a388.5m) plus add-ons. Rohit Sharma\u2019s patient century guided India to a six-wicket victory to leave South Africa staring at a Cricket World Cup exit after their third defeat in three games. And Johanna Konta, the British No 1, can reach her first grand slam final with victory in Paris on Friday but even if she fails she is enjoying her tennis again and believes that is the reason for her resurgence. Business Japan\u2019s Nikkei has eked out some small gains overnight as Asian markets were hampered by concerns about the US trade rows with Mexico and China, prompting investors to buy domestic-demand oriented shares. Mexican and American officials claimed progress in White House talks late on Wednesday but Donald Trump declared it was \u201cnot nearly enough\u201d to halt the import taxes he wants to impose if the flow of migrants to America\u2019s southern border is not addressed. The IMF managing director, Christine Lagarde, has told Reuters that escalating tariff threats are sapping business and market confidence, and could slow growth that is currently expected to improve next year. The pound is worth $1.268 and \u20ac1.129 this morning while the FTSE is due to open a bit higher. The papers D-day commemorations feature on many of the front pages today. The Mirror says \u201cOn behalf of the free world... thank you\u201d, the Mail says we have \u201cA debt we can never repay\u201d, the Telegraph praises \u201cThe resilient generation\u201d, the Times calls the commemorations \u201cA salute to sacrifice\u201d, the Express urges the country: \u201cLet us never forget their sacrifice\u201d and the Sun leads on the Queen\u2019s speech on the anniversary: \u201cMaj generation\u201d. The i and the Guardian have pictures from the commemorations but splash on different stories. The i\u2019s lead is \u201cSave our NHS\u201d, saying the country needs to resist any attempts to sell off the health service to the US, and the Guardian\u2019s is: \u201cSocial services accused of failing toddlers murdered in their homes\u201d. The FT also has a picture of commemorations, featuring the Queen, Donald Trump, Theresa May and Emmanuel Macron. Its top story is: \u201cWoodford fund crisis deepens as St James\u2019s Place cuts $3.5bn ties\u201d.

It used to favour a soft version of Brexit (which is still the position of the overall Labour party in London) but now it has concluded that the option is no longer obtainable, and it is campaigning for remain. <strong>Jeremy Miles</strong>, the Welsh government\u2019s Brexit minister, made the announcement<a href=\"http://record.assembly.wales/Plenary/5662#A51426\"> in the Welsh assembly yesterday afternoon </a>(when many of us were focused on Donald Trump). He explained that the European elections, and the events in the Conservative party, where a new leader is likely to push for a no-deal Brexit, had persuaded the Welsh government to change its mind. He told AMs:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The negotiations between the government and the opposition have broken down, destroyed by the jockeying for prominence of would-be Conservative leaders, and we know that there is no appetite in the parliamentary Conservative party for a form of Brexit that we had consistently advocated, one that retains participation in the single market and a customs union.</p> \n   <p>The prime minister is quitting and her deal is in tatters. It seems inevitable, given the bizarre process and the wholly unrepresentative electorate that will provide us with her successor, that in July we will have a prime minister who will demand, in a show of bravado, if nothing else, that the EU27 reopens negotiations of the withdrawal agreement. This will be rejected, and the government will set a course to a \u2018no deal\u2019 Brexit ...</p> \n   <p>We sought to reconcile the result of the 2016 referendum with the least damaging kind of Brexit, but that effort has now reached the end of the road.</p> \n   <p>The European elections have shown that the electorate remains profoundly divided, and, indeed, the split has widened, with many of those who voted for Brexit in the 2016 referendum now supporting no deal, and many, probably a majority, wanting us to remain within the European Union.

Casualty figures on all sides were immense, with hundreds of thousands of soldiers, sailors, aviators and civilians killed or wounded in the days and weeks that followed.</p> \n   <p>We stand together today to honour the memory of those who paid the ultimate sacrifice on D-Day, and those many millions of men and women who lost their lives during the Second World War, the largest conflict in human history.</p> \n   <p>We affirm that it is our shared responsibility to ensure that the unimaginable horror of these years is never repeated.</p> \n   <p>Over the last 75 years, our nations have stood up for peace in Europe and globally, for democracy, tolerance and the rule of law. We re-commit today to those shared values because they support the stability and prosperity of our nations and our people. We will work together as allies and friends to defend these freedoms whenever they are threatened.</p> \n   <p><strong>We commit to work constructively as friends and allies to find common ground where we have differences of opinion and to work together to resolve international tensions peacefully.</strong></p> \n   <p>We will act resolutely, with courage and tenacity, to protect our people against threats to our values and challenges to peace and stability.</p> \n   <p>In this way, we salute the surviving veterans of D-Day and we honour the memories of those who came before us.</p> \n   <p>We will ensure that the sacrifices of the past are never in vain and never forgotten.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Mostly this is a conventional and rather bland restatement of democratic values. But the paragraph I\u2019ve highlighted in bold about working constructively together \u201cto find common ground ... and ... to resolve international tensions peacefully\u201d can be seen as an attempt to nudge President Trump away from isolationism and back towards upholding what is described as the rules-based international order (RBIO).</p> \n  <p>The Queen delivered a similar message to Trump <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/queens-subtle-message-donald-trump-16251317\">in her speech at the state banquet on Monday.</a></p> \n  <p>The 16 nations who have backed the

          "bodyText": "Tory leadership contenders further set out their stalls this evening. The health secretary Matt Hancock claimed that if elected Jeremy Corbyn would be \u201cthe first antisemitic leader of a western nation since the second world war\u201d. The comments were swiftly condemned by Labour, which claimed the Conservatives had \u201csupported governments that actively promote antisemitic policies in Hungary and Poland\u201d. At a One Nation hustings event, Michael Gove, Matt Hancock, Jeremy Hunt and Dominic Raab (see 7.04pm) elaborated on their Brexit plans. Gove said the UK\u2019s end of October Brexit deadline is \u201carbitrary\u201d and that he is \u201cnot wedded\u201d to it, Hancock appealed to the centre ground and seemed to focus less on Brexit, and Hunt talked up his skills as a \u201clifelong entrepreneur\u201d and said the leader needed to negotiate a better agreement than no-deal, while Raab told Tory MPs he would be prepared to temporarily shut down parliament to make sure Brexit happens by the deadline. Health secretary Hancock declared he would roll back some of the Tory reforms to the NHS which have seen large swathes of the health service privatised. (see 7.24pm) Donald Trump flew from Shannon airport to his golf resort in Doonbed, Co Clarewhere amid protests against the US military\u2019s use of Irish soil to transport military equipment and personnel. (see 8.20pm) Earlier in the day, Trump compared Ireland\u2019s post-Brexit border with Northern Ireland to the US border with Mexico, along which he wants to build a permanent wall. Veteran parachutists jumped over Normandy, 75 years since they did so as paratroopers on D-Day. Trump told Leo Varadkar that he was confident the Irish border situation would be fine after Brexit because some \u201cgood minds\u201d were working on it. However, yesterday afternoon, the US president met the Brexit party leader Nigel Farage and the Tory Brexiters Iain Duncan Smith and Owen Paterson. All three claim that there is no reason why the Irish border should be a problem after Brexit, even in the event of no-deal. (see 6.19pm) The Labour-run government in Wales is now officially committed to remaining in the EU, and is campaigning for remain. (see 4.59pm) Rory Stewart, the international development secretary and a long-shot candidate for the Conservative party leadership, has said the Brexit policies being promoted by many of his rivals, such as Boris Johnson, would be \u201ccatastrophic\u201d for the UK. I\u2019m afraid [other leadership candidates] are misleading themselves and others, and that\u2019s going to be catastrophic, because the reality is that Europe is barely sitting through to the end of October. D-day veterans and world leaders took part in an emotional ceremony to mark the 75th anniversary of the Normandy landings, with a vast security operation safeguarding dignitaries including the Queen, Donald Trump and Theresa May. David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister and May\u2019s de facto deputy, has said the NHS \u201cis not and will not be up for sale\u201d in trade talks with the United States. Speaking at PMQs, in response to a question from Labour\u2019s Rebecca Long-Bailey, who was standing in for Jeremy Corbyn (quite successfully \u2013 see 2.16pm), Lidington said: The prime minister has been very clear and she spoke for everyone in the Government and on this side of the House - when it comes to trade negotiations, the NHS is not and will not be up for sale. Yesterday, at a news conference, President Trump said the NHS would be on the table in any trade talks with the UK. But in an interview broadcast this morning, he retracted that, saying: I don\u2019t see [the NHS] being on the table. Somebody asked me a question today and I say everything is up for negotiation, because everything is. But that\u2019s something I would not see as part of trade. That\u2019s not trade. The Brexit party\u2019s candidate in the Peterborough byelection was criticised for profiteering from buying and selling freeholds of hundreds of new homes. A one-woman show by the new Brexit party MEP Ann Widdecombe was cancelled in protest at her apparent endorsement of gay conversion therapy. We\u2019re now going to wrap up the live blog today. Thanks for reading, and for all your comments. Have a nice evening. Here is our report on tonight\u2019s Tory leadership hustings, courtesy of the Guardian\u2019s Heather Stewart and Rowena Mason. Meanwhile, Labour has challenged frontrunner Boris Johnson to disavow his previous denial of climate science. A peace camp was set up outside Shannon airport to demonstrate against Trump\u2019s arrival, with more than one hundred protesters listening to speeches, poems and music throughout the day. Many criticised Shannon Airport\u2019s use by the American military. In 2002, the Irish government agreed to provide landing and refuelling facilities to the US military at the airport, and close to three million US troops and their weapons have passed through in the years since. Wednesday\u2019s protest was organised by local group Shannonwatch, who hold bi-weekly demonstrations at the airport protesting the military. Politicians Catherine Connolly, the independent TD for Galway, newly elected MEP Clare Daly, and Labour TD for Limerick, Jan O Sullivan, were among the crowd who carried the flags of Venezuela, Puerto Rico, Mexico, Palestine as well as signs and banners protesting Trump. Speaking at the event \u2013 amid a counter protest by about 20 Trump supporters \u2013 Connolly said she felt it important to stand against Trump\u2019s policies. I think President Trump\u2019s policies are not acceptable and it\u2019s unacceptable that we\u2019re using Shannon Airport to traffic American soldiers to wars all over the world, it\u2019s important to stand up for our neutrality. We should be a force for peace in the world. There\u2019s no doubt we have strong relations with America, but that doesn\u2019t take away from the fact that we should stand up for what is right. Saoirse Exton, 13, said the peace camp was her 15th protest and that she was there to stand against Trump\u2019s policies on climate change. I think climate change needs to be stopped and there\u2019s not enough action being taken on it. President Trump doesn\u2019t recognise climate change as a real cause, he pulled out of the Paris Climate agreement, and America has the biggest carbon emissions, and they\u2019re one of the biggest countries that need to take action. I want to preserve this earth for future generations, my generation are going to be the last generation if we don\u2019t do something about it. During the protests, letters were handed to a senior police officer to be passed on to Trump and the taoiseach Leo Varadkar. The letters called for an immediate end to the US military use of Shannon, and what they called \u201cIrish complicity in US military operations, and the environmental destruction of the planet\u201d. Donald Trump defended his environmental record after he was questioned over criticism from his Irish counterpart Michael D Higgins who claimed the US president\u2019s stance on climate change was \u201cregressive and pernicious\u201d. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard those comments,\u201d Trump said amid protests outside Shannon airport before boarding Marine One to fly to his five-star golf resort in Doonbed, Co Clare. But we have the cleanest air in the world in the United States and it\u2019s gotten better since I became president, we have the cleanest water, it is crystal clear, I always say I want crystal clear water and air, so I haven\u2019t heard his comments, but we are setting records environmentally. In a speech in Dublin on Tuesday night, Higgins criticised the US decision to withdraw from the 2015 Paris climate change accord. While the EU has a set of binding emissions targets for 2020 and 2030, we must now plan for full decarbonisation of our European economies by 2050, encouraging the rest of the world to follow suit, and urging in the strongest possible terms the USA to re-consider its regressive and pernicious decision to leave the global Paris Agreement. Environment secretary Michael Gove has said his three Cabinet positions were effectively an \u201capprenticeship\u201d for the top job. According to the Telegraph\u2019s deputy political editor, Steven Swinford, he claimed that he is no longer the neo-conservative he once was and highlighted criticism from Donald Trump over his \u201cweak kneed, lily-livered approach\u201d approach to Iran as evidence of how he has \u201cevolved\u201d. He also said that in hindsight the invasion of Iraq was the wrong decision. Gove went on to say that the deadline of 31 October to leave the EU is \u201carbitrary\u201d. \u201cIf we get to October, let\u2019s say we\u2019re 95% there, say we default to no deal. That would be a mistake,\u201d he is reported to have said \u2013 in opposition to Boris Johnson and Dominic Raab\u2019s positions on the issue. He warned that if government is \u201clocked on\u201d to a no deal, then that would lead to a confidence vote and possibly a general election. \u201cWe would lose that. We would have Corbyn propped up by Sturgeon. Therefore we must deliver Brexit\u201d. Suggesting some of his fellow candidates do not believe in the UK, Gove reportedly said: If you believe in this country then saying I\u2019m going to default to no deal actually isn\u2019t having confidence we will get a deal \u2018It\u2019s because I have confidence in this country and it\u2019s capacity to succeed that I believe we will get a deal. The Guardian\u2019s political correspondent Peter Walker has been examining the register of MP\u2019s interests ahead of the Tory leadership election. Elsewhere, wildcard candidate Rory Stewart is trumpeting his ability to draw a crowd. As one of the more social media savvy candidates, the secretary for international development livestreamed his event. Matt Hancock has told HuffPost UK that as PM he would repeal part of the government\u2019s reforms to privatise the NHS and end a requirement to tender services for outside work It follows calls from NHS bosses to scrap the controversial legislation, which has seen profit-driven health firms win health service contracts in England worth about \u00a310.5bn in the five years since the act came into force. As prime minister, the legislation to improve the way that the NHS works would be a priority for me. We are putting the bill together now, the proposals are very much borne of the NHS. The legislation includes removing some of the legal requirements to go to tender where that isn\u2019t appropriate. With time, it\u2019s been shown that it\u2019s better done a different way. I believe very strongly in the NHS free at the point of use, according to need not ability to pay, that it should be well funded. The central thrust is to try to remove some of the admin burdens and the overbearing legal requirements that have come as a consequence of the last set of reforms. The health secretary also pledged to partly reverse the student nursing bursary axed by the government in 2016, leading to a 30% fall in nursing degree applications. Hancock said there would be new \u201ctargeted support\u201d for mature students, mental health and community nurses under his leadership. There\u2019s a question of how you make sure the money we\u2019ve got goes as far as possible. There\u2019s an overall shortage of nursing. It isn\u2019t as big as the headline vacancy figures suggest. But there are acute shortages, especially in some specific areas like mental health nurses, and community nursing. I want to make sure that the approach we take is to support and incentivise people into those areas where we\u2019ve got shortages. Declaring that he doesn\u2019t need to see Donald Trump after his apparent U-turn over whether the NHS would be \u2018on the table\u2019 in a post-Brexit trade deal, Hancock said: I haven\u2019t sought [a meeting with Trump], I haven\u2019t been granted one. It\u2019s neither here nor there. As the President has confirmed this morning the NHS is not on the table for trade talks so there would be no reason to. He also said cyberflashing could be made illegal. Cyberflashing is absolutely disgusting and it\u2019s a really good case in point where what is illegal offline should also be illegal offline. If a man walked down the street and exposed himself to people who didn\u2019t want that to happen there are laws about that. And yet online it seems increasingly to happen and we need to tackle it. Yes the companies have got a responsibility and frankly their artificial intelligence algorithms should be able to work out what is and isn\u2019t an inappropriate picture but there\u2019s also a legal aspect here where we have the law and it needs to be applied properly. Should we change the law? If need be, like we did on upskirting yes. But the basis should be if it\u2019s illegal offline, it\u2019s illegal online too. I think in this area there\u2019s more work that can be done. Varadkar has spoken to reporters following his meeting with Trump. [Trump] said in the meeting he was aware that the sticking point in negotiations, one of the most difficult points in the negotiations, is the issue of the Irish border and he wants to keep that open and believes that can be done. We didn\u2019t go into any particular detail as to how he thinks it can be done but he understands that that has to be a shared objective - that if the UK is going to leave with a deal, that deal must involve legally-operable guarantees that we won\u2019t see the emergence of a hard border between north and south. [Trump] didn\u2019t elaborate on why he thinks Brexit would be good for Ireland. We very much discussed the different nature of the border and I explained that 20 or 30 years ago we did have a hard border between north and south, particularly when the Troubles were happening and there were customs posts and so on, and that everyone in Ireland - north and south, unionist and nationalist - want to avoid a return to a hard border, but that Brexit is a threat in that regard and an unintended consequence that we can\u2019t allow. Tory leadership contenders Michael Gove, Matt Hancock, Jeremy Hunt and Dominic Raab have been speaking at a One Nation group hustings this evening with chancellor Phillip Hammond in attendance. Former Brexit secretary Raab has been talking up his negotiating skills, arguing that he is the only contender with a credible plan. He said he had \u201cseen the EU upfront and personal\u201d and \u201cas Brexit secretary I looked our EU opposite numbers in the eyes\u201d. I know the strengths but also the weaknesses of their positions. That\u2019s why we don\u2019t just need a conviction Brexiteer. We need someone who is resolute, but someone who can navigate the rocky path ahead and get Brexit delivered. I\u2019m the candidate you can trust, who will give us the best shot of getting a better deal for the UK. Education minister Nadhim Zahawi, a supporter of Raab\u2019s campaign, said he would not rule out anything \u2013 except delaying Brexit once again, which would leave the UK with \u201czero credibility\u201d. In contrast, Gove is said to have suggested the October 31 Brexit deadline could be extended in order to secure a deal, according to George Eustice. He added that candidates offering \u201ceasy, simple answers\u201d by promising to leave on October 31 in any circumstance would \u201ccome unstuck\u201d. An MP who attended the Tory leadership hustings and did not wish to be named said: \u201cHe said that that is the date, but if it needs to move a day or a week in order to avoid something, then we shouldn\u2019t be wedded to a single date.\u201d On a no-deal scenario, the MP said of Gove: \u201cHe said it wouldn\u2019t be ideal, quite obviously. He\u2019s looking for movement on the back stop.\u201d An MP supportive of Hancock said the health secretary had warned the hustings about the possibility of a Labour government. The MP, who also did not want to be named, told reporters: \u201cHe said there would be a danger that we would have an anti-Semitic party with its hands on the levers of power.\u201d This was swiftly rebuffed by Labour, with a source calling it a \u201cbaseless political attack\u201d, according to the Daily Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar. Foreign Secretary Hunt told the hustings that parliament would block a no-deal Brexit, and therefore the Tories needed a leader who could negotiate a better agreement. Referring to himself as a lifelong entrepreneur, he suggested that could be him. At the moment we only have bad choices. We risk Parliament blocking no deal and the EU blocking a better deal, so we need a leader who can negotiate a new approach. I\u2019m an entrepreneur who has been doing deals all my life. I negotiated the new BBC licence fee and the new doctors\u2019 contract. I won\u2019t pretend this will be easy. I met (Emmanuel) Macron and (Angela) Merkel today in Portsmouth and a hardline approach will lead to a hardline response. They will wait for Parliament to block no deal. Here is a snapshot from the lobby: Tonight\u2019s hustings follows a similar event last night. The Spectator\u2019s Katy Balls was the only journalist allowed inside, as she chaired the meeting. Here\u2019s her report. Veteran parachutists are jumping over Normandy, 75 years since they did so as paratroopers on D-Day. Veterans Harry Read, 95, and John \u201cJock\u201d Hutton, 94, followed 97-year old fellow second world war survivor Tom Rice to descend upon Sannerville, in western France. \u201cIt went perfect, perfect jump,\u201d Rice said after his jump into roughly the same area, in fields of wildflowers outside Carentan, that he landed in on D-Day. \u201cI feel great. I\u2019d go up and do it all again.\u201d Rice jumped with the U.S. Army\u2019s 101st Airborne Division on that day 75 years ago, landing safely despite catching himself on the exit and a bullet striking his parachute. He called the 1944 jump the worst he had ever had. Read and Hutton arrived hours later than expected after their plans became fraught with technical difficulties, which then delayed the clearance they needed to enter French airspace. Speaking with reporters afterwards, Read said: I feel good. My health is good and my mind is still ticking away very nicely. I thought the jump was brilliant. I just had thoughts of anticipation after looking forward to it. Everything is worth the wait. The jump was wonderful in every way. I couldn\u2019t believe the drop was going to be postponed in any way because I had his assurance from God. If that had happened, I was going to be examining my faith. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll do another jump again. President Trump told Leo Varadkar that he was confident the Irish border situation would be fine after Brexit because some \u201cgood minds\u201d were working on it. He also said that in Britain he had met some \u201cvery good people\u201d who were heavily involved in Brexit. (See 5.55pm.) He did not say who these very good minds were, or what their solution to the border problem was. But we do know that yesterday afternoon, at the US ambassador\u2019s residence in London, he met the Brexit party leader Nigel Farage and the Tory Brexiters Iain Duncan Smith and Owen Paterson. All three claim that there is no reason why the Irish border should be a problem after Brexit, even in the event of no-deal. And Duncan Smith and Paterson have been heavily promoting the \u201calternative arrangements\u201d border plan promoted by the Tory European Research Group, a new version of which was published by Steve Baker earlier today. (See 3.37pm.) So it is possible that Farage, Duncan Smith and Paterson were the \u201cgood minds\u201d whose plan for the Irish border has impressed Trump. But what do other experts think? Since the new ERG paper was published by Baker today, various experts have been commenting. And they have been damning. David Henig, director of the UK Trade Policy Project, has written a Twitter thread about it starting here. He concludes by saying the plan amounts to a \u201ctotal refusal to face up to the real world\u201d. And here is a Twitter thread from Steve Peers, a law professor. He says \u201canyone producing such dishonest [crap] in any other line of work would lose their professional reputation.\u201d And here is a Twitter threat from Peter Foster, the Telegraph\u2019s Europe editor. That is all from me for tonight. My colleague Mattha Busby is now taking over. This is what President Trump said when he spoke to reporters alongside Leo Varadkar, the Irish PM. We will be discussing various things. Probably you\u2019ll ask me about Brexit because I just left some very good people who are very much involved with Brexit, as you know. And I think that will all work out very well, and also for you with your wall, your border. I mean, we have a border situation in the United States, and you have one over here. But I hear it\u2019s going to work out very well ... It is an honour to be in Ireland with my friend, and he is doing a great job as your prime minister. Varadkar then explained that, actually, having a wall at the Irish border was precisely what he wanted to avoid. Trump accepted this. He went on: I think you do, I think you do. The way it works now is good, you want to try and to keep it that way. I know that\u2019s a big point of contention with respect to Brexit. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s going to work out very well. I know they\u2019re focused very heavily on it. In answer to a question about whether Brexit would be bad for Ireland, Trump said: I think it should be good. The big thing is going to be your border, and hopefully that\u2019s going to work out, and I think it will work out. There are a lot of good minds thinking about how to do it. And it\u2019s going to be just fine. I think ultimately it could even by very, very good for Ireland. But the border will work out. Here is a clip of President Trump talking to Leo Varadkar. I will post the quotes in a moment. President Trump has arrived in Ireland where he is holding talks with Leo Varadkar, the taoiseach (prime minister) before heading off to his golf course. As the BBC\u2019s Jayne McCormack reports, Trump claimed the border issue would not be a problem after Brexit. The Labour-run government in Wales is now officially committed to remaining in the EU. It used to favour a soft version of Brexit (which is still the position of the overall Labour party in London) but now it has concluded that the option is no longer obtainable, and it is campaigning for remain. Jeremy Miles, the Welsh government\u2019s Brexit minister, made the announcement in the Welsh assembly yesterday afternoon (when many of us were focused on Donald Trump). He explained that the European elections, and the events in the Conservative party, where a new leader is likely to push for a no-deal Brexit, had persuaded the Welsh government to change its mind. He told AMs: The negotiations between the government and the opposition have broken down, destroyed by the jockeying for prominence of would-be Conservative leaders, and we know that there is no appetite in the parliamentary Conservative party for a form of Brexit that we had consistently advocated, one that retains participation in the single market and a customs union. The prime minister is quitting and her deal is in tatters. It seems inevitable, given the bizarre process and the wholly unrepresentative electorate that will provide us with her successor, that in July we will have a prime minister who will demand, in a show of bravado, if nothing else, that the EU27 reopens negotiations of the withdrawal agreement. This will be rejected, and the government will set a course to a \u2018no deal\u2019 Brexit ... We sought to reconcile the result of the 2016 referendum with the least damaging kind of Brexit, but that effort has now reached the end of the road. The European elections have shown that the electorate remains profoundly divided, and, indeed, the split has widened, with many of those who voted for Brexit in the 2016 referendum now supporting no deal, and many, probably a majority, wanting us to remain within the European Union. Faced by this sort of binary choice, we are clear that, almost three years on from the referendum, and more than two years after we put forward \u2018Securing Wales\u2019 Future\u2019, we as a government must recognise these realities and change course ... So, as a government, we will now campaign to remain in the EU. And to make that happen, parliament should now show the courage to admit it is deadlocked and legislate for a referendum, with \u2018remain\u2019 on the ballot paper. The Welsh government\u2019s new stance has been welcomed by the Scottish government, which is also anti-Brexit. This is from Michael Russell, the Scottish Brexit minister. Under devolution the Welsh Labour party is free to divert from policy set in London, but nevertheless this development will encourage Labour MPs who want the national party to commit to supporting remain in a referendum. At the moment Jeremy Corbyn remains committed to getting a better version of Brexit, not to stopping it. (Thanks to philipphilip99 in the comments for flagging this up.) Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, claims that, if elected Tory leader, he would be \u201cthe first prime minister to have been an entrepreneur\u201d. He made the claim in a statement to the ConservativeHome website, responding to seven challenging questions it has set him. Here is the relevant question and answer. Q: There is a crisis of trust in the Tory party. And you are very much part of the party establishment \u2013 accomplished, long-serving, moderate, conventional. Are you the transformative leadership that the country needs right now? A: People often confuse continuity with loyalty. Throughout my nine years in cabinet, I\u2019ve always been a loyal team player, but as the first prime minister to have been an entrepreneur, I would take a very different approach. This is an exceptionally serious moment for our country. I think many of our members, supporters and the public are looking for an experienced leader with entrepreneurial flair to help us get the deal we need and look beyond Brexit. Hunt would certainly not be the first PM to have had a successful career \u2013 Stanley Baldwin and Neville Chamberlain both spring to mind \u2013 but Hunt\u2019s claim may be true if you define entrepreneur as someone who has set up a successful business. The ConservativeHome challenging questions for Tory leadership candidates are good. They have also come up with some for Boris Johnson and for Michael Gove, although so far neither Johnson nor Gove has replied. Steve Baker, the Tory Brexiter and deputy chair of the European Research Group, which is pushing for a harder Brexit, has published a new Brexit plan today. Called \u201cA Clean Managed Brexit\u201d (pdf), it is a new version of the standard Brexiter demand \u2013 an agreement with the EU without the backstop, with the UK resorting to no-deal if necessary, using \u201calternative arrangements\u201d to avoid a hard border in Ireland. But Northern Ireland businesses and academics have dismissed the paper as \u201cmore of the same\u201d in relation to its plans to guarantee an invisible border between the region and the Republic of Ireland post Brexit. Aodh\u00e1n Connolly, head of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said: \u201cIf it was homework I would give it an F minus.\u201d He said their report showed no proper solutions for the border and failed to provide any detail on key issues including health checks on animals which are mandatory and must be done on the border under EU laws. The EU has already indicated that milk from Northern Ireland could not cross over to the republic in a post-Brexit scenario unless there was a clear deal keeping regulations the same north and south of the border, something the DUP is implacably opposed to. Rory Stewart, the international development secretary and a long-shot candidate for the Conservative party leadership, has said the Brexit policies being promoted by many of his rivals, such as Boris Johnson, would be \u201ccatastrophic\u201d for the UK. His rivals were misleading voters, he claimed. Stewart is strongly opposed to a no-deal Brexit. But the Brexiters in the contest have said they would accept no deal and Johnson has said the UK must leave the EU by 31 October, with or without a deal. Stewart told the Emma Barnett Show on Radio 5 Live: I\u2019m afraid [other leadership candidates] are misleading themselves and others, and that\u2019s going to be catastrophic, because the reality is that Europe is barely sitting through to the end of October. Let\u2019s take a candidate like Boris. He\u2019s saying that he\u2019s going to go to Europe, and he\u2019s going to negotiate a new deal before October 31, and if he doesn\u2019t get a new deal by 31 October he\u2019s going to go no deal. Anyone who knows anything about Europe can assure you there is not the slightest hope of getting a new deal through Europe by October 31. Not a hope. D-day veterans and world leaders have taken part in an emotional ceremony to mark the 75th anniversary of the Normandy landings, with a vast security operation safeguarding dignitaries including the Queen, Donald Trump and Theresa May. David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister and May\u2019s de facto deputy, has said the NHS \u201cis not and will not be up for sale\u201d in trade talks with the United States. Speaking at PMQs, in response to a question from Labour\u2019s Rebecca Long-Bailey, who was standing in for Jeremy Corbyn (quite successfully \u2013 see 2.16pm), Lidington said: The prime minister has been very clear and she spoke for everyone in the Government and on this side of the House - when it comes to trade negotiations, the NHS is not and will not be up for sale. Yesterday, at a news conference, President Trump said the NHS would be on the table in any trade talks with the UK. But in an interview broadcast this morning, he retracted that, saying: I don\u2019t see [the NHS] being on the table. Somebody asked me a question today and I say everything is up for negotiation, because everything is. But that\u2019s something I would not see as part of trade. That\u2019s not trade. Many voters have a \u201cdistinct antipathy\u201d towards Boris Johnson, which could hamper his chances of winning a future general election even if he delivered Brexit, the Conservative peer and polling expert Robert Hayward has said. Channel 4 has announced it is holding a Tory leadership hustings on Sunday week. Steve Baker, the Tory Brexiter and deputy chair of the European Research Group, which represents Conservatives pushing for a harder Brexit, has said he will stand for the party leadership if colleagues ask him to. Asked about his intentions, he said: I am in the hands of my colleagues ... If we get to the opening and closing of nominations on Monday and we collectively agree there must be somebody willing to do this, then I would be willing to be the person who gets nominated. Nigel Farage has said his Brexit party will not join the far-right Europe of Nations and Freedom Group in the European parliament. The ENF includes various far-right parties from across Europe including Italy\u2019s the League, France\u2019s National Rally and Austria\u2019s Freedom party. Farage said: Following a brief social meeting with a member of the ENF Group last week there has been much speculation, fuelled by that individual, that the Brexit party will join them in their European parliament group. I can confirm that this is not the case and that the Brexit party will not be joining the ENF group. The Brexit party\u2019s candidate in the Peterborough byelection has been criticised for profiteering from buying and selling freeholds of hundreds of new homes, it has emerged. A one-woman show by the new Brexit party MEP Ann Widdecombe has been cancelled in protest at her apparent endorsement of gay conversion therapy. Women born in the 1950s whose retirement age was increased from 60 to 65 have gone to court seeking a judicial review of how the government raised the retirement age and to try to force the government to repay their lost pensions. I was not covering PMQs as it happened because we were focusing on the D-day commemorations. That means I missed what colleagues tell me was a good PMQs debut by Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, who was standing in for Jeremy Corbyn. Normally Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, leads for Labour at PMQs when Corbyn is not there. But this week Corbyn gave the job to Long-Bailey. The party has not said why, but there is a suspicion that Thornberry (who has leadership aspirations) angered Corbyn\u2019s inner circle by pushing support for a second referendum after the European election results further than they would like. And Long-Bailey, a protege of John McDonnell, has for a while now been seen as the Corbynites\u2019 preferred candidate in the leadership contest that will take place when Corbyn retires. Giving her the PMQs slot will raise her profile. That would have backfired if she had done badly, but she didn\u2019t. This is what some journalists are saying about her performance. From my colleague Heather Stewart From the BBC\u2019s Norman Smith From my colleague Dan Sabbagh From the Daily Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar From the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg From the blogger Guido Fawkes (who never normally has anything positive to say about Labour MPs, especially Corbynites) From CBS\u2019s Mark Knoller Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, has issued this statement about the D-day commemoration. She said: It is a great honour to represent the people of Scotland at the commemorations marking the 75th anniversary of the D-day landings. Scotland owes a great debt of gratitude to all those who served during the second world war, especially to those who made the ultimate sacrifice. It is important that current and future generations continue to learn of the events that took place on this day 75 years ago, so that we can strive to ensure that such conflict is never repeated. It is also important the generations to come understand and recognise that it is the actions of those who served that allow us to enjoy the freedoms we now take for granted. Here are some more pictures from the D-day event. Theresa May is holding a series of bilateral meetings with world leaders at the D-day event. Downing Street said she had met her Polish counterpart, Mateusz Morawiecki, and was due to have talks with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, and Canada\u2019s Justin Trudeau. \u201cThe main theme of the talks today is about shared security,\u201d a Downing Street spokeswoman said. Here is the \u201cfamily photo\u201d for leaders attending the D-day commemorations. In the back row, from left to right: the Slovakian deputy prime minister, Richard Rasi; the Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki; the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau; Luxembourg\u2019s prime minister, Xavier Bettel; the Norwegian prime minister, Erna Solberg; the Belgian prime minister, Charles Michel; the Czech prime minister, Andrej Babis; the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison; and the Danish ambassador to the UK, Lars Thuesen. And in the front row, from left to right: New Zealand\u2019s governor general, Patsy Reddy; the French president, Emmanuel Macron; Britain\u2019s prime minister, Theresa May; Prince Charles; the Queen; the US president, Donald Trump; the Greek president, Prokopis Pavlopoulos; the German chancellor, Angela Merkel; and the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte. There were some reminders of historical details during the commemoration. Many American troops were based in Portsmouth and other towns and cities across southern England. A letter home from Private Arthur Pranger of the 86th Chemical Mortar Battalion dated 6 May 1944 was read out: Dear Mom, Somebody is always shoving a cup of tea in my fist. People even stop us on the street and invite us for tea and cake. The kids around here are always asking for chewing gum and candy. They can\u2019t get that over here and everything is rationed. There\u2019s hardly any automobiles here and everybody rides a bicycle. The chief of the defence staff, General Sir Nicholas Carter, paid tribute to the tactical ingenuity that lead to the success of the Normandy landings: The marvellous range of technology that helped to make the landings succeed and ensured that over two million men and half a million vehicles could be landed in the ensuing months included amphibious and mine clearing tanks, Mulberry harbours, gliders, undersea pipelines, self-heating soup cans, air-portable motor-bikes \u2013 all reflected British ingenuity and innovation at its best. Flags from the 14 allied nations that took part in the Normandy Landings were displayed during the event. The flags are historically accurate for 1944 so in many instances were not the same as they appear today. For example, the French flag displayed was the Free French Flag. Another example was the Canadian flag, which only adopted a maple leaf in 1965. Music was provided by, among others, a 70-piece orchestra and a 90-strong choir. Hymn to the Fallen, composed by John Williams \u2013 the track that opens the film Saving Private Ryan \u2013 was played and the actor and singer Sheridan Smith performed the song made famous by Vera Lynn, We\u2019ll Meet Again. Linda Spence, a university worker from Portsmouth who was carrying a home-made placard stating \u201cKeep your tiny, groping hands off our NHS \u2018Mr\u2019 president\u201d, tried to speak to one of the men who attempted to disrupt the anti-Trump protest in the centre of the town. \u201cI just asked him why he was so angry and then he just started shouting, and then his mate tried to grab my placard,\u201d said Spence, who spoke to a man wrapped in a US flag seconds after he snapped a protest placard in two and waved part of it around. He was saying that it was a disgrace that we were here and that we should be down at the D-day commemorations. I said that I would have loved to have been there but I felt it was important to protest and send a message in support of the NHS services that he and all of us use, and which could be under threat if Trump has his way in trade talks. One of the speakers at the D-day event was Sergeant John Jenkins MBE, 99, from Portsmouth, who was in the Pioneer Corps on D-day and landed on Gold beach on 8 June. He said: I was 23 years old when I landed on Gold beach. I was terrified, I think everyone was. I look back on it as a big part of my life. I was just a small part in a very big machine. Jenkins said he was honoured to be at the service along with other D-day veterans. You never forget your comrades because we were all in it together. It is right that the courage and sacrifice of so many is being honoured 75 years on. We must never forget. The events on the stage end with Sheridan Smith singing the wartime classic We\u2019ll Meet Again. Now an RAF flypast is taking place. The Queen is speaking now. She says when she attended the 60th anniversary D-day event some people thought it would be the last event of its kind. But the wartime generation, \u201cmy generation\u201d, is resilient, and she is delighted to be here. She says 75 years ago hundreds of thousands of soldiers, sailors and airmen left these shores in the cause of freedom. At the time her father, King George VI, said what was required was more than courage; it was a revival of spirit. She says many of those young people never returned. It is with humility and pleasure, on behalf of the country and the whole free world, that she says thank you. The Portsmouth commemoration also paid tribute to the secret agents who worked behind enemy lines in the build up to D-day and to the French resistance. Of the several hundred Special Operations Executive agents working behind enemy lines, 55 were women. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, read the last letter of a young resistance fighter Henri Fertet, executed at just 16 years old: My dear parents, I am going to die for my country. I want France to be free and the French to be happy \u2026 The soldiers are coming to get me. I must hurry. My handwriting may look wobbly but it is just because I am using a small pencil. I am not afraid of death, my conscience is completely clear ... A thousand kisses. Long live France. Some of those who survived appeared at the event. There was warm applause for a group of British veterans when they took to the stage. A video was shown of Eugene Deibler, an American veteran who served as a sergeant in the 501st Airborne Regiment, and parachuted into Normandy at 01.30 on 6 June, behind Utah beach. He said he had never jumped in conflict before. We did what we had to do. We jumped in there. I\u2019m glad I did it, went from a boy to a man. One note of disappointment \u2013 there are scores of unoccupied seats in the official commemoration event, which seems a shame. Some locals have expressed disappointment that they have been kept away because of the tight security. At the D-day commemoration the audience have just been watching an extract from Pressure, the play by David Haig about James Stagg, the chief meteorologist who advised General Dwight Eisenhower about the weather ahead of D-day. Amid the pomp and ceremony it was the stories of the real people who took part in D-Day that shone out during the commemoration in Portsmouth. Theresa May read a letter from Captain Norman Skinner of the Royal Army Service Corps, written to his wife Gladys on 3 June 1944. The letter was still in his pocket when he landed on Sword Beach on 6 June. Skinner was killed the day after, leaving his wife and two young daughters. The letter read: My thoughts at this moment, in this lovely Saturday afternoon, are with you all now. I can imagine you in the garden having tea with Janey and Anne getting ready to put them to bed. Although I would give anything to be back with you, I have not yet had any wish at all to back down from the job we have to do. There is so much that I would like to be able to tell you. Nearly all of which you\u2019ve heard many, many times. But just to say that I mean it even more today. I\u2019m sure that I will be with you again soon and for good. Please give my fondest love to my Anne and my Janey. God bless and keep you all safe for me. A telegram was shown on screen, accompanied by a voice over: Dear Mrs Skinner, it is with the upmost difficulty that I write to offer you my most profound sympathies on the untimely death of your husband. All the time he had been under my command, he had done a grand job of work. Piper Alastair Parks, who serves with 4 SCOTS, The Highlanders, 4th Battalion The Royal Scottish Regiment, read an extract from the autobiography of piper Bill Millins recounting his experience of playing on the Normandy beaches: I jumped off the ramp as quickly as possible holding the bagpipes above my head, and landed in the water up to my waist ... I placed the bagpipes on my shoulder, blew them up, and started to play Highland Laddie as I waded the few yards to the beach. Here is the text of the letter read out by Theresa May. (See 12.15pm.) Theresa May is now reading out a letter written by a Captain Skinner to his wife two days for before D-day. In it, Skinner said this was a difficult letter to write. Anyone with imagination must worry about what will happen, Skinner said. He said he had had some lovely years with his wife. He could imagine his family in the garden. He would give anything to be with them, but would not back down from the job he had to do. He asked his wife to give his love to his children. After May finishes, the text of a telegram later sent to Mrs Skinner announcing her husband\u2019s death was read out. Here is the translation of the letter from a French resistance fighter read out by Emmanuel Macron, the French president. (See 12.03pm.) My dear parents, My letter is going to cause you great sorrow, but I have seen you so full of courage in the past that I do not doubt that you will remain courageous, if only out of love for me. I am going to die for my country. I want France to be free and the French to be happy. I do not want France to be arrogant and the world\u2019s leading nation but hard-working, industrious and honest. Scuffles broke out in the centre of Portsmouth today after groups of football casuals marched through a protest against the US president\u2019s presence in the city during D-day commemorations. A few dozen men marching behind a banner with the crest of Portsmouth Football Club at the centre of a Union flag chanted \u2018scum, scum, scum\u2019 as they arrived midway through speeches by trade unionists and others who had organised a gathering of a few hundred people in the city\u2019s Guildhall Square. Police stepped in as the men scattered and tried to square up to those in the protest, who broke into chants of \u2018nazi scum off our streets. Amid some pushing and shoving, one man with a US flag wrapped around his waist grabbed one of the protest placards and snapped after waving part of it around. The group then adjourned to a pub as the rally continued with speakers evoking the sacrifice of veterans who had fought to liberate Europe from nazism. I will be focusing on the D-day commemoration for the next half an hour, and will pick up PMQs later. In Portsmouth Emmanuel Macron, the French president, is now reading out a letter written by a French resistance fighter. He starts by thanking the other countries on behalf of his nation. Then he reads out the letter, in French. In it, the fighter says he does not fear death because his conscience is clear. These are from my colleague Ben Quinn who is in Portsmouth. President Trump is speaking now at the D-day event. He is reading from a D-day prayer written by FD Roosevelt, the US president in 1944. World leaders attending the D-day commemoration in Portsmouth include: the French president, Emmanuel Macron; the prime minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau; the US president, Donald Trump; Australia\u2019s prime minister, Scott Morrison; the prime minister of Belgium, Charles Michel; the Czech Republic\u2019s prime minister, Andrej Babis; the Greek president, Prokopis Pavlopoulos; Germany\u2019s chancellor, Angela Merkel; the prime minister of Luxembourg, Xavier Bettel; the Dutch PM, Mark Rutte; Norway\u2019s PM, Erna Solberg; Poland\u2019s PM, Mateusz Morawiecki; and Slovakia\u2019s deputy prime minister, Richard Rasi. At the commemoration Trudeau has just read out the citation from the first Canadian to receive the Victoria Cross in the second world war, a soldier who led his men across a bridge under heavy fire saying \u201cthere\u2019s nothing to worry about here\u201d. The D-day commemoration is mostly ceremonial, but it does have a political edge to it. To coincide with it, Downing Street has got the 16 nations who are attending to sign something called the \u201cD-day proclamation\u201d. Here is the text in full. Seventy five years ago, our countries were about to embark on a decisive battle. On 6 June 1944, 160,000 Allied troops landed at Normandy, signalling the beginning of the end of the war in Europe. Casualty figures on all sides were immense, with hundreds of thousands of soldiers, sailors, aviators and civilians killed or wounded in the days and weeks that followed. We stand together today to honour the memory of those who paid the ultimate sacrifice on D-Day, and those many millions of men and women who lost their lives during the Second World War, the largest conflict in human history. We affirm that it is our shared responsibility to ensure that the unimaginable horror of these years is never repeated. Over the last 75 years, our nations have stood up for peace in Europe and globally, for democracy, tolerance and the rule of law. We re-commit today to those shared values because they support the stability and prosperity of our nations and our people. We will work together as allies and friends to defend these freedoms whenever they are threatened. We commit to work constructively as friends and allies to find common ground where we have differences of opinion and to work together to resolve international tensions peacefully. We will act resolutely, with courage and tenacity, to protect our people against threats to our values and challenges to peace and stability. In this way, we salute the surviving veterans of D-Day and we honour the memories of those who came before us. We will ensure that the sacrifices of the past are never in vain and never forgotten. Mostly this is a conventional and rather bland restatement of democratic values. But the paragraph I\u2019ve highlighted in bold about working constructively together \u201cto find common ground ... and ... to resolve international tensions peacefully\u201d can be seen as an attempt to nudge President Trump away from isolationism and back towards upholding what is described as the rules-based international order (RBIO). The Queen delivered a similar message to Trump in her speech at the state banquet on Monday. The 16 nations who have backed the D-day proclamation are: Australia, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, New Zealand, Poland, Slovakia, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. In Portsmouth the D-day commemoration event is just starting. Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, and Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, are both at the D-day commemoration. President Trump and his wife, Melania, have arrived at Portsmouth for the D-day commemoration. And here is the Queen arriving. There\u2019s a festival atmosphere in the public viewing area on Southsea Common ahead of the D-Day commemoration in Portsmouth. Residents and visitors are separated from the official area by fences and walls and armed police survey are observing the scene from a temporary tower. But people have brought in deckchairs and picnics and grabbed spots in front of the big screens that will relay the official commemoration event when it begins on the other side of the barricades. There are burger stands and beer tents and merchandise stalls selling everything from souvenir mugs to fridge magnets and tea towels. Very British. There are a few grumbles from local people that they are not going to see the Queen or Donald Trump in person because of the tight security. No sign of demonstrators on the common as yet. A mile away from Southsea Common, some anti-Trump protestors are gathering in Portsmouth\u2019s Guildhall Square. The idea is that they don\u2019t want it to appear that they are protesting against the veterans. One of the organisers, Simon Magurian from Portsmouth Stand Up To Racism, said: Thousands of local people have signed a petition opposing his involvement. We are protesting against a racist who aligns with the far right. He supports the very forces women and men died to defeat. Donald Trump will be greeted by images of the baby blimp effigy of himself when he visits Portsmouth on the final day of his state visit, the Press Association reports. A campaign group which \u201chacks\u201d advertising boards has plastered images of the balloon, which flew over Parliament Square on Tuesday, to bus shelters in the city. A Special Patrol Group spokesman said: The Trump Baby has relentlessly trolled the president across the world, from London to Paris to Buenos Aires, and we wanted to make sure that he got a look-in at Portsmouth too. D-day is about commemorating the fight against fascism, but Trump is pursuing a dangerous far-right agenda and fanning the flames of hatred. President Trump has been tweeting again about his state visit. @IngrahamAngle is Laura Ingraham, a Fox News broadcaster. Jeremy Hunt has had a one-to-one meeting with Donald Trump, a source close to the foreign secretary said. As the Press Association reports, the talks took place on Tuesday night, towards the end of the second day of the US president\u2019s state visit. Trump is expected to meet fellow Tory leadership contender Michael Gove today and has already spoken by telephone to Boris Johnson. Yesterday at this press conference Trump said he did not know what Gove was like. But in his interview with Good Morning Britain, Trump was more positive about Gove. He said: I don\u2019t know him. I met him last night [ie, Monday night] at the dinner for the first time. I thought he was very good. You have a lot of good people running. I was saying to the Queen last night, the choice of your next prime minister is very important. On the subject of the Conservative leadership, here is the latest ConservativeHome tally of how many MP endorsements each candidate has. And here are the numbers. Boris Johnson - 46 Jeremy Hunt - 32 Michael Gove - 29 Dominic Raab - 24 Sajid Javid - 17 Matt Hancock - 11 Esther McVey - 6 Mark Harper - 5 Rory Stewart - 5 Andrea Leadsom - 3 Penny Mordaunt, the defence secretary, has been giving interviews today ahead of the D-day commemoration. But she has been refusing to say whether she will enter the contest for the Conservative leadership. \u201cI think, today, this is not about me or the Conservative party, it is about these amazing veterans. We should have the focus on them, please,\u201d she told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. Like Theresa May, Jeremy Corbyn will be missing PMQs today because he is attending the D-day commemoration in Portsmouth. D-day may be the only American-led invasion in history that he has endorsed. This morning he released this statement paying tribute to the people who took part in it. He said: The troops that landed on the beaches of France 75 years ago showed unimaginable heroism. Many laid down their lives in the fight against fascism. People will have heard the recent serialisation of Anne Frank\u2019s Diaries on BBC radio. It was heart-breaking to hear her excitement and optimism about the Allied landings in Normandy, shortly before she was transported to Auschwitz, and then Bergen-Belsen. It was a poignant reminder of the evils of Nazism, and why its defeat by the Allied forces was so essential for humanity. We must not just commemorate those who fought, and died, but honour them by opposing the forces of hatred today. Only by standing up to hate, oppression and war can we protect international cooperation and peace. Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, has released his Tory leadership campaign video this morning. It is slightly reminiscent of a famous Conservative party election broadcast in 1992 which featured John Major returning to Brixton, where he grew up, and reminiscing about his modest upbringing there. At one point, Major wonders if a house he used to live in is still there and, as his car approaches it, declares \u201cit is, it is\u201d. Hunt\u2019s \u201cit is\u201d moment comes at the start of the video, when he returns to the garage where he set up his publishing business 25 years ago. He explains: Now that might look like any old garage but to me it actually means something because above that garage is where I set up my publishing business. And coming back here for the first time in 25 years it looks a bit small. That business actually grew to more than 200 people. But this is where I employed the very first one. Unlike Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, his two main rivals, Hunt was a successful entrepreneur before he became an MP and he focuses on this in his video, claiming that this shows he has the skills needed to be PM. In the video he says: If you want to make it [running a business], you\u2019ve got to show leadership, negotiating skills and confidence. And that\u2019s what we need to do as a country right now with the Brexit challenge that we face. It is the final day of Donald Trump\u2019s state visit to the UK and he will join other world leaders for what is likely to be a sombre and moving event in Portsmouth to commemorate the 75th anniversary of D-day. But this morning ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain has been broadcasting an interview Trump did with Piers Morgan yesterday, and various important lines have emerged. As Rowena Mason reports, Trump has gone back on the comment he made in his press conference yesterday about how he would want access to the NHS to be part of a US-UK trade deal. As Matthew Weaver and Kate Lyons report, Trump also revealed that Prince Charles spent 75 minutes longer than scheduled trying to convince him of the dangers of climate change. In a tweet this morning Trump has also reverted to his habit of lying about the reception he has received on the streets in London. He has already twice claimed, falsely, that there were large crowds of people supporting him (see here and here) but now he is claiming that the \u201ccorrupt\u201d media is suppressing the truth. Because it is so obviously a symptom of vanity, it it tempting to laugh, but disregarding the truth so blatantly is straight out of Orwell\u2019s 1984. Here is the agenda for the day. 8.30am: Matt Hancock, the health secretary and a Tory leadership candidate, gives a speech to the Policy Exchange thinktank. 9am: Esther McVey, the former work and pensions secretary and a Tory leadership candidate, holds a phone-in on LBC. 9.50am: Equality and Human Rights Commission chairman David Isaac and its chief executive, Rebecca Hilsenrath, give evidence to the Commons women and equalities committee. 11am: The Queen, Theresa May, Donald Trump and other world leaders attend the D-day commemoration event at Portsmouth. 12pm: David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, takes PMQs. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, is for the first time standing in for Jeremy Corbyn. 12.30pm: Steve Baker, the Tory Brexiter and deputy chair of the European Research Group, publishes a paper on Brexit. 2.15pm: Michael Gove, the environment secretary and a Tory leadership candidate, gives evidence to the Scottish affairs committee on post-Brexit agriculture. 4.50pm: Trump arrives at Shannon airport in Ireland, where he will hold talks with Leo Varadkar, the taoiseach, before going to his golf course at Doonbeg where he will be staying the night. 5pm: Gove, Hancock, Jeremy Hunt and Dominic Raab speak at a private hustings organised by the One Nation group of Tory MPs. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although I will be focusing mostly on the D-day commemoration and developments in the Tory leadership contest. I plan to post a summary at the end of the day. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

          "bodyText": "Canadians can no longer turn a blind eye to the \u201cgenocide\u201d of Indigenous peoples in the country, a landmark report on missing and murdered women has concluded. Indigenous communities across the country have for decades attempted to convey the depth and scope of a tragedy that has haunted thousands of families. As many as 4,000 Indigenous women and girls are believed to have been killed or gone missing in Canada over the past 30 years \u2013 although the true number of victims is unlikely ever to be known. On Monday the findings of a three-year inquiry were released at a solemn ceremony in Quebec, attended by victims\u2019 families, survivors, Indigenous leaders and senior government officials. \u201cThis is an uncomfortable day for Canada,\u201d said the prime minister, Justin Trudeau. \u201cWe have failed you. We will fail you no longer.\u201d The inquiry\u2019s final report, a 1,200-page catalogue of historical and contemporary injustices, concludes that decades of policy and state indifference amounted to genocide against Indigenous peoples. The report\u2019s authors were blunt in their assessment: \u201cIf you\u2019re not outraged, you\u2019re not paying attention \u2026 This is every Canadian\u2019s responsibility not to turn a blind eye.\u201d The report, called Reclaiming Power and Place, marks the government\u2019s most signifiant attempt at determining the scope of the epidemic of violence that has claimed the lives of thousands of indigenous women. \u201cThe violence against Indigenous women, girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA [two-spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, questioning, intersex and asexual] people is a national tragedy of epic proportion,\u201d wrote the chief commissioner, Marion Buller. Commission members conceded that the term \u201cgenocide\u201d is likely to provoke controversy in the country but said they carefully examined the United Nations definition of the term \u2013 as well as its original intent from the 1940s. \u201cGenocide is the sum of the social practices, assumptions, and actions detailed within this report,\u201d they wrote. Indigenous activists hailed the report as an important turning point. \u201cIt\u2019s powerful. It\u2019s sad. It angers me. But it\u2019s also hopeful because it shows the real strength, resilience and determination of Indigenous women and girls,\u201d said Pam Palmater, a Mi\u2019kmaq law professor at Ryerson University. \u201cOur First Nations communities, our leaders and our activists just never gave up. They kept pushing and pushing.\u201d But others who attended the ceremony were disappointed by Trudeau\u2019s failure to present new policies. \u201cThe prime minister really offered up nothing more than words,\u201d said Cindy Blackstock, a Gitxsan child welfare advocate and professor. \u201cI was looking for something that would actually make a difference in the lives of women and girls today.\u201d Blackstock noted that the government\u2019s recent budget that did not allocate any funding to implement the recommendations of the long-expected inquiry. The inquiry \u2013 an electoral promise by Trudeau after the previous Conservative government refused to open one \u2013 accepted submissions from 2,380 people, including the testimony of 468 family members of survivors and victims across the country at 15 community hearings. \u201cMany Indigenous people have grown up normalized to violence, while Canadian society shows an appalling apathy to addressing the issue,\u201d the commissioners wrote. The report also includes 231 recommendations for future action. \u201cIt must be understood that these recommendations, which we frame as \u2018Calls for Justice,\u2019 are legal imperatives \u2013 they are not optional,\u201d said the report. The wide-ranging recommendations include overhauling policing practices in Indigenous communities, giving Indigenous languages official status, creating a universal basic income and investing in early childhood programs for Indigenous youth. While the document exposes a damning narrative of the country\u2019s history, it also encourages a path forward. \u201cFor many non-Indigenous people, it\u2019s important to be ready to \u2018unlearn\u2019 some learned behaviours,\u201d said the report. Veldon Coburn, who teaches Indigenous studies at Carleton University, said Canadians need to understand the role of state institutions such as residential schools where more than 150,000 aboriginal children were taken in an attempt to forcibly assimilate them into Canadian society \u2013 and work to dismantle those practices. But he added that Canadians also need to work to dismantle those practices. \u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be any settler Canadian who should feel personally responsible for this. They\u2019ve never carried this out themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cIt should be forward looking, in the true spirit of reconciliation with one another, saying we want to live in a community and respect the existence of our shared humanity.\u201d Before Canadian society begins to grapple with such difficult questions, Coburn said attention should be focused on the memories of the thousands of Indigenous peoples were murdered or have gone missing. \u201cThe biggest point today is to honour those that are the most vulnerable within Canadian society, and who have borne the brunt of considerable discrimination and marginalization,\u201d he said. \u201c[Their] lives are worthy of equal concern and respect.\u201d",

          "body": "<p>In the dense jungle battlefields of the south Pacific, Louis Levi Oakes was a target. Often flanked by bodyguards as he carried a large field pack with a tangle of transmission lines, the men surrounding Oakes were assigned to protect a valuable asset \u2013 his language.</p> <p>A Mohawk soldier from a territory straddling the US and Canada, Oakes was the last surviving member of a secretive group of second world war soldiers who used their native language to confound and frustrate enemy forces.</p> <p>On 28 May he died at his home, surrounded by family. He was 94.</p> <p>Known as the Mohawk code talkers, Oakes and 16 others from the Mohawk nation of Akwesasne were part of a broader \u2013 but clandestine \u2013 facet of the allied war effort. Because critical communications were vulnerable to interception, the military recruited indigenous speakers to transmit sensitive messages. As many as 500 speakers of indigenous languages were recruited into the US military to work as code talkers, including Navajo, Tlingit, Lakota, Meskwaki, Cree and Comanche, all of whom were sworn to secrecy.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/14/navajo-code-talkers-second-world-war\">code they used</a>, drawn from 33 different languages, confused both the Germans and Japanese, who failed to break the code.</p> <p>But the classified nature of their work kept Oakes and others silent for generations.</p> <p>It was not until 2008, when the Code Talkers Recognition Act \u2013 which permitted Congress to recognise those who served in highly secretive roles nearly seven decades earlier \u2013 was passed, that the scope and extent of indigenous people\u2019s contributions to the war effort was officially acknowledged. In 2016, Oakes was awarded the Silver Star, the US military\u2019s third-highest combat honour, for \u201cgallantry in action against the enemy\u201d.</p> <p>Born in 1925 in St Regis, Quebec, part of the Akwesasne nation, Oakes enlisted in the US military aged 19. Part of his decision to enlist in the US, as opposed to Canada, stemmed from a violent encounter with Canadian federal police, who arrested and beat his brother.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I was in Canada, the Mounties were bad. Really bad,\u201d Oakes told the US Congress\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/vets/\">veterans </a><a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/vets/\">history </a><a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/vets/\">project</a>. \u201cThey broke up [my brother\u2019s] face and everything.\u201d</p> <p>The Akwesasne people, along with other Mohawk nations in the area, have a complex relationship with the US and Canada. They see themselves as an independent and sovereign nation, rather than a part of either country. As a result, the relationship between nations is often viewed as one of friendship and military alliances.</p> <p>After his training at Pine Camp in New York and later in Louisiana, military leaders discovered that Oakes spoke Mohawk and assigned him to train as a code talker.</p> <p>During the war, Oakes was sent to New Guinea and the Philippines and often had bodyguards to protect him from Japanese soldiers, who he said \u201chid up in the mountains\u201d.</p> <p>He was honourably discharged from service in 1946.</p> <p>\u201cLevi was a man who utilised his language unselfishly to preserve the freedoms bestowed upon us today,\u201d said the Akwesasne leadership in a statement posted to Facebook.</p> <p>After the war Oakes moved to Buffalo in New York, where he spent his 30-year career as an iron worker, before returning to St Regis.</p> <p>\u201cHe served a unique role in fighting to protect this land, his homeland, and he\u2019s an exemplary reminder of the many First Nations men and women who served this country with bravery and distinction,\u201d said the Assembly of First Nations national chief, Perry Bellegarde, in a statement following news of Oakes\u2019s death.</p> <p>Last December, Oakes\u2019s military service was honoured in Canada\u2019s House of Commons.</p> <p>\u201cTypically when dignitaries are in the house, there\u2019s a cautious applause,\u201d said Marc Miller, a Liberal MP. \u201cBut when he was announced by the speaker \u2026 I\u2019ve never heard anything like it.\u201d Parliamentarians and guests gave Oakes a standing ovation when his name was read out.

          "bodyText": "In the dense jungle battlefields of the south Pacific, Louis Levi Oakes was a target. Often flanked by bodyguards as he carried a large field pack with a tangle of transmission lines, the men surrounding Oakes were assigned to protect a valuable asset \u2013 his language. A Mohawk soldier from a territory straddling the US and Canada, Oakes was the last surviving member of a secretive group of second world war soldiers who used their native language to confound and frustrate enemy forces. On 28 May he died at his home, surrounded by family. He was 94. Known as the Mohawk code talkers, Oakes and 16 others from the Mohawk nation of Akwesasne were part of a broader \u2013 but clandestine \u2013 facet of the allied war effort. Because critical communications were vulnerable to interception, the military recruited indigenous speakers to transmit sensitive messages. As many as 500 speakers of indigenous languages were recruited into the US military to work as code talkers, including Navajo, Tlingit, Lakota, Meskwaki, Cree and Comanche, all of whom were sworn to secrecy. The code they used, drawn from 33 different languages, confused both the Germans and Japanese, who failed to break the code. But the classified nature of their work kept Oakes and others silent for generations. It was not until 2008, when the Code Talkers Recognition Act \u2013 which permitted Congress to recognise those who served in highly secretive roles nearly seven decades earlier \u2013 was passed, that the scope and extent of indigenous people\u2019s contributions to the war effort was officially acknowledged. In 2016, Oakes was awarded the Silver Star, the US military\u2019s third-highest combat honour, for \u201cgallantry in action against the enemy\u201d. Born in 1925 in St Regis, Quebec, part of the Akwesasne nation, Oakes enlisted in the US military aged 19. Part of his decision to enlist in the US, as opposed to Canada, stemmed from a violent encounter with Canadian federal police, who arrested and beat his brother. \u201cWhen I was in Canada, the Mounties were bad. Really bad,\u201d Oakes told the US Congress\u2019s veterans history project. \u201cThey broke up [my brother\u2019s] face and everything.\u201d The Akwesasne people, along with other Mohawk nations in the area, have a complex relationship with the US and Canada. They see themselves as an independent and sovereign nation, rather than a part of either country. As a result, the relationship between nations is often viewed as one of friendship and military alliances. After his training at Pine Camp in New York and later in Louisiana, military leaders discovered that Oakes spoke Mohawk and assigned him to train as a code talker. During the war, Oakes was sent to New Guinea and the Philippines and often had bodyguards to protect him from Japanese soldiers, who he said \u201chid up in the mountains\u201d. He was honourably discharged from service in 1946. \u201cLevi was a man who utilised his language unselfishly to preserve the freedoms bestowed upon us today,\u201d said the Akwesasne leadership in a statement posted to Facebook. After the war Oakes moved to Buffalo in New York, where he spent his 30-year career as an iron worker, before returning to St Regis. \u201cHe served a unique role in fighting to protect this land, his homeland, and he\u2019s an exemplary reminder of the many First Nations men and women who served this country with bravery and distinction,\u201d said the Assembly of First Nations national chief, Perry Bellegarde, in a statement following news of Oakes\u2019s death. Last December, Oakes\u2019s military service was honoured in Canada\u2019s House of Commons. \u201cTypically when dignitaries are in the house, there\u2019s a cautious applause,\u201d said Marc Miller, a Liberal MP. \u201cBut when he was announced by the speaker \u2026 I\u2019ve never heard anything like it.\u201d Parliamentarians and guests gave Oakes a standing ovation when his name was read out. During the visit he met Justin Trudeau, and regaled the Canadian prime minister with stories of meeting his father, the former prime minister Pierre Trudeau. Miller, a Canadian army veteran, met Oakes privately in 2017 after hearing stories of the code talkers\u2019 wartime exploits. Oakes, seated in a wheelchair, inched forward and listened intently when Miller tried to speak to him in Mohawk. \u201cThere\u2019s a deep irony in the fact that the language that was used to save so many lives, and to give us the freedoms we have today, upon return, was stolen from them,\u201d said Miller. Many indigenous peoples who fought abroad faced discrimination and racism upon their return to Canada, and a government intent on vanquishing their language and culture. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of focus on truth and reconciliation right now,\u201d said Miller, of the country\u2019s attempts to reckon \u2013 and atone for \u2013 past injustices towards indigenous peoples. \u201cBut we really need to focus on the first word: truth. And really learn the truth about those who sacrificed so much in service to us. Levi Oakes was a hero.\u201d",

          "bodyText": "I\u2019m logging off, readers, here is the top news from this afternoon: William Barr says Obama administrations officials did not commit treason in their investigation of Russia interference in the 2016. Software firm Salesforce is banning the sale of guns on its technology. Ted Cruz and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez promised to introduce legislation cracking down on former Congress members entering lobbying positions after leaving office following a conversation on Twitter. The Trump administration has made moves towards updating NAFTA. A judge in Missouri was weighing a Planned Parenthood request that health officials be blocked from closing the state\u2019s sole abortion provider. A ruling was expected before midnight Friday, when the clinic\u2019s license would expire. The ulterior motive of voter suppression behind a Trump administration push to include a citizenship question on the 2020 Census was laid bare in new documents from the archive of a deceased GOP consultant. Trump accused former special counsel Robert Mueller of a conflict of interest, again offered a wildly misleading version of the Mueller report and then admitted in a tweet that Russia helped him win the election. Attorney general William Barr repeated his criticism of Mueller\u2019s decision not to decide on whether the evidence against Trump warranted charging him with a crime. Obama Administration officials who oversaw the investigation of Russian interference in US elections did not commit treason, Attorney General William Barr said in an interview with CBS. Barr admitted he has concerns about the way officials conducted investigations into Russian interference in the US elections and Trump campaigns ties to such issues, but believes the investigators did not commit treason. The full interview will air on CBS on Friday morning. \u201cSometimes people can convince themselves that what they\u2019re doing is in the higher interest and better good,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t realize that what they\u2019re doing is really antithetical to the democratic system that we have.\u201d On May 24, president Donald Trump doubled down on his orders to \u201cinvestigate the investigators\u201d and gave Barr authority to declassify intelligence documents related to the Russian attack on the 2016 election. Trump had accused former FBI officials of \u201ctreason\u201d and an ongoing \u201cwitch hunt\u201d against him. Software firm Salesforce is banning customers from using its technology to sell semiautomatic weapons. The tech giant, which has a market value of nearly $120 billion, has changed its acceptable-use policy to target sales of weapons, according to a report from the Washington Post. It will now prohibit customers from using Salesforce framework to market products, manage customer service operations, and fulfill orders involving certain kinds of guns including semi-automatic weapons, automatic weapons, \u201cmagazines capable of accepting more than 10 rounds\u201d and \u201cmulti-burst trigger devices.\u201d CEO Marc Benioff has been publicly supportive of gun control and in favor of bans on military-style rifles in the past. A conversation on Twitter has led to an unlikely collaboration between Republican Sen. Ted Cruz and Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez to pass legislation targeting lobbying by former members of Congress. The two Congress members both tweeted support of placing restrictions or a potential lifetime ban on former Congress members becoming lobbyists. The conversation began when Ocasio-Cortez tweeted a study from Public Citizen that found 60% of former Congress members have taken jobs influencing federal policy. \u201cIf you are a member of Congress and leave, you shouldn\u2019t be allowed to turn right around and leverage your service for a lobbyist check,\u201d she wrote. Cruz retweeted Ocasio-Cortez, suggesting introducing bi-partisan legislation to drain \u201cthe swamp.\u201d Republican House representative Chip Roy tweeted that he would help Ocasio-Cortez spearhead the effort. She later agreed to create a bipartisan team in the House and Cruz will form one in the Senate to write a ban. Currently lawmakers in the Senate have to wait two years after they leave office to engage in any lobbying and former House members have to wait only one year. Ocasio-Cortez and Cruz have previously butted heads on Twitter, arguing about the price of croissants at the airport (really) and minimum wage. Lobbying appears to be a rare area where the two agree. Previous efforts to prevent lobbying from former Congress have been put forth but not passed, including a 2017 bill co-sponsored by Republican senator Cory Gardner and Democratic senators Michael Bennet and Al Franken. Also in 2017, Sen. Jon Tester of Montana introduced legislation that would ban lawmakers from lobbying their former colleagues until five years after leaving office but it failed to gain traction. Presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has also called for legislation preventing former Congress members from lobbying. A Mississipi lawsuit claims the way the state choses governors is racist. From the Associated Press: In 1890, as white politicians across the South cracked down on the black population with Jim Crow laws, Mississippi inserted into its constitution an unusually high bar for getting elected governor or winning any other statewide office. The provision, which remains in force to this day, says candidates must win not only a majority of the popular vote - that is, more than 50% - but also a majority of the state\u2019s 122 House districts. On Thursday, more than a century later, four black Mississippians sued in federal court to put an end to what they say is a racially discriminatory system, unique in the U.S. and aimed at thwarting the election of African Americans. \u201cThe scheme has its basis in racism - an 1890 post-Reconstruction attempt to keep African Americans out of statewide office,\u201d said former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, the first black person to hold that position. He added: \u201cIn the 21st century, it\u2019s finally time to say that this provision should be struck down.\u201d Holder is chairman of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, whose affiliated foundation is providing financial and legal backing for the lawsuit. A report from the Associated Press says Congressional voting records on a $19 billion disaster aid bill shows \u201cthe inconsistency of lawmakers, mostly conservatives, who stood resolute against such aid six years ago but demand it now that their states are under water.\u201d The same political maps that Trump likes to display that show wide expanses of less-populated regions of the country like the Midwest, the rural South, and the Gulf Coast registering solidly for him also track with recent disasters. Now, the desperate cries for help are coming from across Georgia, Iowa, Nebraska and the Florida Panhandle, whose residents and representatives tend to be Trump loyalists. The House failed to pass the disaster bill during a pro forma session of the House on Thursday, with Republican John Rose of Tennessee stepping in to stop its passage. The measure will be revived and passed next week. The Trump administration has made a significant step toward enacting changes to the North American trade agreement, according to CNN. US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer will send a draft of changes to NAFTA to Congress on Thursday, sources told CNN, triggering a 30-day waiting period before the White House can officially submit the full legislation. The submission of the \u201cStatement of Administrative Action\u201d draft puts NAFTA on schedule to be ratified as early as the end of June and would set up a vote for late 2019. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi spoke against this move, according to CNN, saying Democrats seek would like to see labor concerns regarding the new deal addressed before moving forward. \u201cThe Trump Administration\u2019s decision to send Congress a draft statement of administrative action before we have finished working with US Trade Representative Lighthizer to ensure the USMCA benefits American workers and farmers is not a positive step,\u201d Pelosi said in a statement. \u201cIt indicates a lack of knowledge on the part of the administration on the policy and process to pass a trade agreement.\u201d Hello everyone, this is Kari Paul in San Francisco taking over for the next few hours. The Washington Post reports president Trump is threatening Mexico with new tariffs over the ongoing surge of migrants from the country seeking asylum in the US. Trump \u201cteased\u201d the decision to reporters on Thursday morning. Trump is planning to make the announcement Friday, but some White House aides are trying to talk him out of it, arguing that such a threat would rattle financial markets and potentially imperil passage of the USMCA trade agreement, according to these officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal administration plans. Here\u2019s a summary of developments so far today: A judge in Missouri was weighing a Planned Parenthood request that health officials be blocked from closing the state\u2019s sole abortion provider. A ruling was expected before midnight Friday, when the clinic\u2019s license would expire. The ulterior motive of voter suppression behind a Trump administration push to include a citizenship question on the 2020 Census was laid bare in new documents from the archive of a deceased GOP consultant. Trump accused former special counsel Robert Mueller of a conflict of interest, again offered a wildly misleading version of the Mueller report and then admitted in a tweet that Russia helped him win the election. Attorney general William Barr repeated his criticism of Mueller\u2019s decision not to decide on whether the evidence against Trump warranted charging him with a crime. Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is running for president, repeated her call for Trump\u2019s impeachment and said if he weren\u2019t president \u201che\u2019d be in handcuffs.\u201d Trump said he might call on his \u201cfriends\u201d Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson during an upcoming UK trip. Trump denied he was behind a White House order to keep the warship USS John S McCain \u201cout of sight\u201d during a recent Trump visit to Japan but said whoever gave the order was \u201cwell-meaning.\u201d Trump also spoke at a graduation ceremony for the US Air Force Academy: The government now owns Paul Manafort\u2019s condo in Trump Tower. Among other crimes, Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman now serving a seven-and-a-half year sentence in federal prison, was convicted of defrauding the IRS of millions by failing to declare overseas income. Politico reports: When is Judge Michael Stelzer expected to rule on a Planned Parenthood request to block health officials from closing Missouri\u2019s sole abortion provider? Before midnight Friday, when the license for the clinic in question is set to lapse, reports the St Louis Post Dispatch: Stelzer\u2019s decision is expected before midnight Friday. He\u2019ll weigh whether DHSS\u2019s interpretation of Missouri rules for renewing licenses conflicts with state law and if the state\u2019s failure to renew Planned Parenthood\u2019s license interferes with a woman\u2019s constitutional right to an abortion. The Riverfront Times reports arrests at the abortion rights rally in the state office building in St Louis: A hearing was held in a St Louis court earlier today on a Planned Parenthood request for an injunction on health officials\u2019 efforts to cancel a license for the state of Missouri\u2019s sole abortion provider. No further action in that case yet. Here\u2019s a parallel protest at the city\u2019s landmark Gateway Arch: The Trump administration can\u2019t resume work on border wall projects in Texas and Arizona using Pentagon funds, pending the resolution of a court appeal, a federal judge in California has ruled: Here\u2019s more from the San Francisco Chronicle: But [Judge] Gilliam, the first judge to consider lawsuits challenging the wall, ruled last Friday that Trump appeared to be defying the will of Congress, which must authorize all federal government appropriations. His injunction blocked administration from using $1 billion, which Congress had approved last year for Defense Department antidrug operations, to build walls in border areas near El Paso, Texas, and Yuma, Ariz. Critics of former special counsel Robert Mueller who fault Mueller for his decision to punt on the question of whether the evidence supported an indictment of the president have included the attorney general, William Barr, who at the start of this month said he was \u201csurprised\u201d that Mueller declined to weigh charges. In a new interview with CBS News, Barr says \u201cI personally felt he could\u2019ve reached a decision\u201d on whether charges against the president were warranted. Mueller had reasoned, in something of a constitutional Catch-22, that his inability under justice department guidelines to bring charges meant he could not weigh charges, because to potentially conclude that charges were warranted but then not bring them would be damaging to the rule of law and the constitutional guarantee of equality before the law. Barr doesn\u2019t think much of that line of reasoning: Former SDNY prosecutor Elie Honig responds: In reply to a question from reporters about the USS John S McCain being cloaked to protect Donald Trump\u2019s eyes during a recent trip to Japan, Biden says McCain was a hero, \u201che was a friend of mine but we argued like the devil\u201d and \u201cwe need a lot more John McCains.\u201d Pending a court decision on health officials\u2019 attempted closure of Missouri\u2019s sole abortion provider, abortion rights activists have taken over several floors of the state office building in St Louis: (h/t @jessicaglenza) Amy Klobuchar, the Minnesota senator and presidential candidate, is on the campaign trail in Nevada today: Donald Trump has said he might meet with Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson during his trip to the UK next week. \u201cWell I may,\u201d Trump said when asked about a potential summit. \u201cNigel Farage is a friend of mine, Boris is a friend of mine. They\u2019re two very good guys, very interesting people. Nigel\u2019s had a big victory, he\u2019s picked up 32% of the vote, starting from nothing and I think they\u2019re big powers over there I think they\u2019ve done a good job.\u201d Trump was giving a typically freewheeling press conference after arriving back in Washington DC from his trip to Japan. It was hard to hear reporters\u2019s questions over the sound of the presidential helicopter, but someone appeared to ask Trump if he was thinking about supporting either Farage or Johnson. \u201cI like them, they\u2019re friends of mine, but I haven\u2019t thought about supporting them. Maybe it\u2019s not my business to support people but I have a lot of respect for both of those men.\u201d Late next month the Democratic presidential candidates will hold two consecutive nights of \u201cdebates\u201d, featuring 20 candidates, which collectively will constitute the first primary \u201cdebate\u201d. The party has just laid out some ground rules. That\u2019s ten (10) podiums \u2013 per night: The most damning evidence yet has emerged that the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to add a question about citizenship to the 2020 US census amount to a racist play to disenfranchise Democrats and voters of color. The US Supreme Court heard a challenge to the citizenship question plan last month but has yet to issue a ruling. In a bombshell New York Times report, journalist Michael Wines describes documents recently unearthed from the archive of the mastermind of the Republican gerrymander, Thomas Hofeller, now deceased. The documents reveal the true intent behind including the citizenship question on the census: it \u201cwould be advantageous to Republicans and non-Hispanic whites,\u201d as Hofeller puts it, in an analysis of Texas state legislative districts. Political maps are currently drawn based on a state\u2019s total population. But the Trump administration has proposed drawing the maps based on the number US citizens of voting age - not overall population. Thus the push to include the citizenship question on the decennial census. The Trump administration has disingenuously framed its proposal as a defense of voting rights. Via the Times: The disclosures represent the most explicit evidence to date that the Trump administration added the question to the 2020 census to advance Republican Party interests. And this from a related court case: Judge Michael Steltzer in Missouri\u2019s 22nd Circuit Court has heard Planned Parenthood\u2019s request for an injunction of state health officials\u2019 move to cancel the license of the state\u2019s sole abortion provider. Judge Steltzer adjourned \u201cpromptly\u201d after hearing from both sides, a court officer said. We\u2019re waiting on further action. The license cancellation was anticipated to go into effect Friday. Here\u2019s video of Warren. \u201cImpeachment it is,\u201d she says: Trump has arrived in Colorado, per Trump. The president has found a way to use the death announced today of seven-term Mississippi senator Thad Cochran to take another dig at the late senator John McCain. \u201cThad never let our Country (or me) down!\u201d Trump writes. The vice-president is in Ottawa for talks with the Canadian prime minister. For those of you looking forward to the Mike Pence-Justin Trudeau joint presser later today, here\u2019s an amuse-bouche: Elizabeth Warren was the first presidential candidate to call for Trump\u2019s impeachment. This morning on the View, she says if Trump weren\u2019t president \u201che would be in handcuffs\u201d: Is this the \u201cdramatic\u201d announcement about immigration that Trump telegraphed this morning? Politico reports that Trump is weighing a further move against asylum-seekers from Central America: President Donald Trump is considering sweeping restrictions on asylum that would effectively block Central American migrants from entering the U.S., according to several administration officials and advocates briefed on the plan. A draft proposal circulating among Trump\u2019s Homeland Security advisers would prohibit migrants from seeking asylum if they have resided in a country other than their own before coming to the U.S., according to a DHS official and an outside advocate familiar with the plan. If executed, it would deny asylum to thousands of migrants waiting just south of the border, many of whom have trekked a perilous journey through Mexico. US law explicitly grants \u201cany alien\u201d physically present in the United States the right to apply for asylum. Read further: Trump\u2019s typical tactic after someone criticizes him \u2013 from Michael Cohen to Mitt Romney \u2013 is to say that offstage that person had been begging him, Trump, for some favor, implying that the criticism stems from some personal sour grapes. Here he tries out the tactic on Robert Mueller, claiming that Mueller wanted to replace James Comey as FBI director, but Trump wouldn\u2019t let him, so Mueller, you know, became special counsel, investigated and prosecuted an elaborate Russian election-tampering campaign and then repeatedly explicitly declined to exculpate the president on suspicions that Trump had committed a criminal obstruction of justice. Buuuut: Trump is due to address a graduation ceremony for the US Air Force Academy shortly, but he apparently can\u2019t stop thinking about and taking swings at Mueller. A Planned Parenthood support group has announced a rally in St Louis, Missouri, where a court will weigh in today on a move by health officials to shutter the state\u2019s sole abortion provider as early as Friday: (h/t @jessicaglenza) The View cohost Meghan McCain has responded to Trump\u2019s latest attack on her late father, accusing Trump of having a corrosive effect on military culture: Missouri could become the first US state in the modern era without an abortion clinic, officials with the last remaining facility, in St Louis, said on Tuesday. Health officials in Missouri have refused to renew the clinic\u2019s license, demanding that all seven physicians and trainees practicing there be made available for what officials of the women\u2019s reproductive healthcare provider Planned Parenthood described as an \u201cinterrogation\u201d. The fight will be in court today, CNN reports: Reproductive Health Services of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region, which has provided abortions for more than two decades, filed suit Tuesday against Missouri Gov. Michael Parson and the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, which administers the license the clinic needs. The suit requests a restraining order against the state, in order to avoid the disruption of services. An emergency hearing on this case originally was scheduled for Wednesday afternoon in the Circuit Court of St. Louis. But it was then postponed to late Thursday morning for reasons \u201coutside everybody\u2019s control,\u201d said Judge Michael Steltzer. \u201cThis is not a drill. This is not a warning. This is a real public health crisis,\u201d said Dr Lena Wen, president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. \u201cThis week, Missouri would be the first state in the country to go dark \u2013 without a health center that provides safe, legal abortion care.\u201d Read further: After a day of defending himself for being a potential criminal and running a White House that covers the name of a warship with a tarp to protect his eyes, Donald Trump has told reporters outside the White House that he will make a \u201cdramatic\u201d statement about the country\u2019s southern border. Reuters reports: He told reporters the statement would be his biggest on the issue to date and would be about people crossing the border illegally. \u201cThis is a big-league statement, but we are going to do something very dramatic on the border,\u201d Trump said, adding he was not closing the border. The acting US secretary of defense, Patrick Shanahan, nominated by Donald Trump earlier this month, has denied knowledge of a reported White House order to the Navy to keep the warship USS John S McCain \u201cout of sight\u201d during a recent presidential visit to Japan. The ship was named for the father and grandfather of former Arizona senator John McCain, who died last year of cancer. Trump has derided McCain for being a prisoner of war and attacked him for voting down a Republican health care bill. Shanahan has ordered staff to look into reports that the name of the warship was hidden during Trump\u2019s visit, and that sailors from the ship wearing uniforms identifying it by name were blocked from attending a Trump speech. The White House order, which so far has been traced to no one, was first reported by the Wall Street Journal. Further remarks via Defense One: Shanahan on USS McCain: \u201cI never authorized... any action around the movement or activity regarding that ship. Furthermore, I would never dishonor the memory of a great American patriot like Sen. McCain. I would never disrespect the young men and women that crew that ship.\u201c Meghan McCain reacted on Twitter late Wednesday: Trump has denied knowledge of the order: Before departing for Colorado Thursday, Trump said \u201cI was not a big fan of John McCain\u201d and called whoever ordered the warship concealment \u201cwell-meaning\u201d: Donald Trump renewed his attack on Robert Mueller Thursday, a day after the former special counsel said at a press conference that investigators could not conclude that the president had not committed a crime. Immediately after Mueller spoke, the White House declared total vindication. But Trump was back on the defensive on Twitter Thursday morning. In his tweets, Trump kept up the White House campaign to distort what the Mueller report says and what Mueller said. At his press conference, Mueller said that he did not weigh charges against Trump because justice department guidelines prevented the indictment of a sitting president. But on Twitter, Trump said Mueller \u201cwould have brought charges, if he had ANYTHING.\u201d Then amid a rant about \u201cthis witch hunt hoax,\u201d Trump appeared to admit that Russia helped elect him president: Trump attempted to clean up that tweet in reply to a question from reporters covering his departure for Colorado today, where he is to address a graduation ceremony for the US Air Force academy. \u201cNo, Russia did not help me get elected,\u201d Trump told reporters, in contradiction of the Mueller investigation\u2019s finding that Moscow ran a yearslong hacking and social media campaign to boost Trump and defeat Hillary Clinton. In his morning Twitter-tribe, Trump also said \u201cMueller didn\u2019t find Obstruction either,\u201d when in fact the Mueller report describes 11 episodes in which Trump or his campaign engaged in potential obstruction of justice. To paraphrase: Mueller: \u201cWe can\u2019t indict the sitting president. But if we could clear the president of criminal charges we would. [Significant Silence].\u201d Trump: \u201cIf I did anything wrong Mueller would have charged me, which he has not meaning I did nothing wrong.\u201d In the blog today we\u2019ll round up the latest reactions to Mueller\u2019s appearance Wednesday, and look at how Democrats are wrestling with the question of potential impeachment of the president. And we\u2019ll catch up with Democratic presidential candidates campaigning across the country. Thanks for joining us.",

Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, absolved the chief of any crime in an emotional ceremony at Poundmaker Cree Nation in Saskatchewan province on Thursday, \u201cToday, our government acknowledges that Chief Poundmaker was a peacemaker who never stopped fighting for peace. A leader who, time and time again, sought to prevent further loss of life in the growing conflict in the Prairies,\u201d Trudeau said, acknowledging the \u201cprofound impact\u201d the conviction of Poundmaker had on the community. \u201cI am here today, on behalf of the government of Canada, to confirm without reservation that Chief Poundmaker is fully exonerated of any crime or wrongdoing.\u201d Milton Tootoosis, headman and councillor at Poundmaker Cree Nation, went into the day expecting an \u201cemotional, sad and exciting\u201d event. \u201cAn apology like this is certainly a century overdue,\u201d he said before the ceremony.
