The statement came one day after Trudeau announced that Canadian hostage John Ridsdel, a former mining executive, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/25/canadian-hostage-beheaded-by-islamist-militants-in-philippines\">was killed by Abu Sayyaf militants</a>, hours after a ransom demand from the group went unanswered. </p> <p>Ridsdel\u2019s death has reignited debate over whether nations should engage with ransom demands from terrorists. On Tuesday, Trudeau forcefully argued that ransom payment simply serve to fund terrorism and criminal activity, while also setting a dangerous precedent. \u201cPaying ransom for Canadians would endanger the lives of every single one of the millions of Canadians who live, work and travel around the globe every single year,\u201d Trudeau said. </p> <p>He said he had spoken with David Cameron, the British prime minister, earlier in the day. Cameron had offered his condolences over the death of Ridsdel, who also held a British passport. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/apr/26/canadian-pm-justin-trudeau-calls-beheading-cold-blooded-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4tja7\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2494186\"            data-video-name=\"Canadian PM Justin Trudeau calls beheading \u2018cold-blooded murder\u2019 \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-571ebcabe4b0386b6c84c72f\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/04/26/160426Canada_h264_publish.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11263522&amp;format=video/webm\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11263522&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;minwidth=700\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11263522&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11263522&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;maxwidth=700\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/apr/26/canadian-pm-justin-trudeau-calls-beheading-cold-blooded-video\">Canadian PM Justin Trudeau calls beheading \u2018cold-blooded murder\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The two leaders also discussed their shared opposition to paying ransoms. \u201cWe agreed that it is something we are going to make sure we do bring up with our friends and allies around the world as we come to grips with the fact that the world is a dangerous place,\u201d Trudeau said. </p> <p>A 2013 agreement saw major western countries <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/aug/22/terrorist-ransom-government-pay-james-foley\">commit to end the practice of paying ransom to terrorist groups</a>, with the understanding that it puts a target on the nationals of certain countries and inflates ransoms to a price that is out of reach for families or employers trying to negotiate the release of captives. </p> <p>The commitment has at times capitulated to public pressure and politics, with countries such as France, Italy, Spain and Germany reportedly channeling money to terrorist groups in recent years in exchange for the release of their citizens. </p> <p>Questions have also been raised about Canada, after the Associated Press reported that <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/al-qaeda-letter-indicates-1-1m-paid-to-free-diplomats-fowler-guay-1.1390027\">C$1 million was paid by unknown parties</a> to secure the 2009 release of two Canadian diplomats kidnapped in Niger by al-Qaida. </p> <p>Trudeau said on Tuesday that Canada was in close contact with authorities in the Philippines in the hopes of pursuing Ridsdel\u2019s killers.

          "bodyText": "Canada and Britain will work together to urge other nations to halt the flow of ransom payments to terrorists, prime minister Justin Trudeau said on Tuesday, as he fielded questions about the recent death of a Canadian hostage in the Philippines. \u201cCanada does not and will not pay ransom to terrorists, directly or indirectly,\u201d Trudeau told reporters in Alberta. The statement came one day after Trudeau announced that Canadian hostage John Ridsdel, a former mining executive, was killed by Abu Sayyaf militants, hours after a ransom demand from the group went unanswered. Ridsdel\u2019s death has reignited debate over whether nations should engage with ransom demands from terrorists.

A 2013 agreement saw major western countries commit to end the practice of paying ransom to terrorist groups, with the understanding that it puts a target on the nationals of certain countries and inflates ransoms to a price that is out of reach for families or employers trying to negotiate the release of captives. The commitment has at times capitulated to public pressure and politics, with countries such as France, Italy, Spain and Germany reportedly channeling money to terrorist groups in recent years in exchange for the release of their citizens.

          "bodyText": "Justin Trudeau will lobby governments to approve the Paris climate agreement and bring it into force as soon as possible, reversing Canada\u2019s past reputation as a \u201ccarbon bully\u201d. The Canadian prime minister will join 155 other countries at the United Nations on Friday for a symbolic signing ceremony. Trudeau is determined to bring the deal into force - possibly as early as this year - and will lobby other governments to that end, according to Catherine McKenna, the environment and climate minister. \u201cWe are going to do whatever we can to encourage countries to ratify,\u201d she said. Some 55 countries covering 55% of global emissions must formally approve or ratify the agreement before it comes into force. Trudeau is hoping to bring the climate deal to the Canadian parliament for formal approval by the end of the year, McKenna told the Guardian. \u201cWe are going to ratify this year,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to get Canadians on board, but the timeline is certainly this year.\u201d Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general, has built the 22 April signing ceremony into a key event, calculating that - once a deal had been forged in Paris last December - governments\u2019 engagement with climate change might wane. That strategy appeared to have paid off, with campaign groups reporting more mobilisation around the Paris deal. Obama is sending John Kerry, the secretary of state, to represent the US at the ceremony. Negotiators feared a long time lag would compromise efforts to hold warming 2C below pre-industrial levels, the goal of the agreement. There has already been about 1C of warming. \u201cWe had 195 countries come together so we want to make sure those 195 countries are staying engaged and staying committed,\u201d McKenna said. That sentiment is widespread. Ahead of the signing ceremony, religious leaders and institutional investors called on governments to follow through on their pledges from Paris. On Monday, about 250 religious leaders called on countries to revisit their pledges - and take more ambitious cuts, such as the phase out of fossil fuel subsidies and the transition to 100% renewable energy. \u201cThe planet has already passed safe levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere,\u201d the statement from the religious leaders said. \u201cUnless these levels are rapidly reduced, we risk creating irreversible impacts putting hundreds of millions of lives, of all species, at severe risk.\u201d On Tuesday, institutional investors managing $24tn in assets called on leaders to move swiftly to bring the Paris agreement into force. \u201cMaintaining strong momentum is particularly important in the lead up to the G20 meeting in China,\u201d Emma Herd, chief executive of the Investor Group on Climate change for Australia, said in a statement. Since his election last year, Trudeau has shown increasing interest in the role of a global climate leader. After coming to power last year, he moved to break with the pro-oil policies of his conservative predecessor, Stephen Harper. His government is in the midst of a six-month review of climate and energy policy. In a visit to the White House last month, Trudeau and Barack Obama agreed to work together on a host of climate initiatives. One of the biggest was a commitment to reduce emissions of methane, a powerful climate pollutant, from the oil and gas industry. That meeting of minds between Trudeau and Obama has raised expectations of a North American climate alliance between the US, Canada and Mexico. \u201cIf you can mobilise Canada and the US and Mexico, that sends a strong signal to the world,\u201d McKenna said. On a domestic front, however, she acknowledged that Canada faced challenges. A carbon price was a \u201cno-brainer\u201d, McKenna said. However, it was difficult reconciling the economic pressures on energy-producing provinces such as Alberta and Newfoundland and provinces such as Ontario, Quebec, and British Columbia, which already have strong climate policies.",

It is the kind of thing any sufficiently engaged politician could pick up from a decent briefing, given expert help. Such help is available in abundance at Perimeter, and available anywhere to any suitably senior politician who wants it. Kudos to Trudeau for being clever, interested and confident enough to do this. As a friend of mine, Paul Clarke, put it on twitter:<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/paul_clarke/status/721261598216753152\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-cards=\"hidden\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Trudeau is less &quot;a genius&quot; than someone who was interested enough to read about science, and engaged enough to remember it and articulate it</p>&mdash; Paul Clarke (@paul_clarke) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/paul_clarke/status/721261598216753152\">April 16, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The reporter asked the question in a joking fashion, not unkindly as far as I can tell, but not expecting an answer either. If this had been an announcement about almost any other government investment, wouldn\u2019t the reporter have expected a brief explanation of the basic ideas behind it? Indeed, Paul again:<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/paul_clarke/status/721261981060218880\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-cards=\"hidden\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The swooning over his words on quantum computing tells you a lot about the mindset of the political and journalist classes</p>&mdash; Paul Clarke (@paul_clarke) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/paul_clarke/status/721261981060218880\">April 16, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>It does tell us a lot.

          "bodyText": "On Friday Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada, visited the Perimeter Institute \u2013 Canada\u2019s premier theoretical physics establishment. He was there to announce significant continued funding for their work. This includes basic quantum theory, with implications for quantum information and computing, an area emphasised by Perimeter Founder and Board Chair Mike Lazaridis. A reporter prefaced a question to Trudeau with: I was going to ask you to explain quantum computing but... haha... The response was more than he bargained for. He got his explanation, and quite a good one: This seems to have enhanced Trudeau\u2019s reputation no end, and quite right too. But it is worth thinking a bit about why. The explanation he gives is clear, brief, and understandable to a non-specialist. It is the kind of thing any sufficiently engaged politician could pick up from a decent briefing, given expert help. Such help is available in abundance at Perimeter, and available anywhere to any suitably senior politician who wants it. Kudos to Trudeau for being clever, interested and confident enough to do this. As a friend of mine, Paul Clarke, put it on twitter: The reporter asked the question in a joking fashion, not unkindly as far as I can tell, but not expecting an answer either. If this had been an announcement about almost any other government investment, wouldn\u2019t the reporter have expected a brief explanation of the basic ideas behind it? Indeed, Paul again: It does tell us a lot. One thing it tells us is that they could be improved. Actually I am optimistic enough to think that if journalistic competence and expectations were raised, many politicians would be happy to rise to the challenge. Presumably, some would not be able to do so, and that would also be interesting information. The results could benefit everyone.

Ongoing efforts in two dozen states in the US and various countries around the world, such as Australia and the UK, are fraught with political maneuvering.</p> <p>Some form of aid in dying is already legal in the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Luxembourg and five states in the US \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/06/california-doctors-aid-in-dying-access\">including California</a>, which signed Death with Dignity into law in December. But those successes have come in spite of powerful opposition from the Catholic church and its \u201cpro-life\u201d allies who have used their ethical and moral authority to shame advocates, legislators and, importantly, medical practitioners.</p> <p>In a 2011 <a href=\"http://www.usccb.org/issues-and-action/human-life-and-dignity/assisted-suicide/to-live-each-day/upload/to-live-each-day-with-dignity-hyperlinked.pdf\">statement</a> from the United State\u2019s Conference of Catholic Bishops, \u201cTo Live Each Day with Dignity\u201d, the Catholic church\u2019s position on pain is clear: \u201cAs Christians we believe that even suffering itself need not be meaningless \u2013 for as Pope John Paul II showed during his final illness, suffering accepted in love can bring us closer to the mystery of Christ\u2019s sacrifice for the salvation of others.\u201d </p> <p>The church\u2019s state-level activism is characterized by calls for protection of the most vulnerable and respect for human dignity, worthy goals that are difficult to challenge, but their underlying doctrine remains the assertion that end-of-life pain can be a soul-saving lesson.</p> <p>The idea that a patient\u2019s last days are imbued with special meaning continues to resonate with many, both inside and outside the church.

Since the 1950s, when medical advancements fostered the lofty promise of a cure for every disease \u2013 and even death \u2013 medical training, research and practice has focused on treating disease, not treating patients\u2019 suffering. Cure the patient, the thinking goes, and the pain will take care of itself.</p> <p>This focus on eliminating disease distracted the field from the sustained and effective research of how to best eradicate pain. Palliative medicine, the specialty of pain relief which grew out of hospice care in the 1970s and 80s, has made great strides in recent years, but it is still a burgeoning field. It wasn\u2019t recognized as a specialty by the American Medical Association until 2006, and many medical schools still do not teach future doctors how to deliver terminal diagnoses, how to discuss end of life decision making, or how to treat pain. In the US, a vast shortage of palliative specialists persists: there is one doctor for every 20,000 elders with severe chronic illness.</p> <p>Some, including Catholic opponents of aid in dying, have cited this shortfall as a reason to oppose its legalization, reasoning that better hospice and palliative care access will eliminate patients\u2019 pain and suffering and therefore their need for medical assistance with dying. But this argument again relies on a sentimentalization of patients\u2019 last weeks and days.</p> <p>Others, like California governor Jerry Brown, support legalization only after weighing personal preferences. \u201cIn the end, I was left to reflect on what I would want in the face of my own death,\u201d he wrote in a statement after signing Death with Dignity into law, \u201cI don\u2019t know what I would do if I were dying in prolonged and excruciating pain. I am certain, however, that it would be a comfort to be able to consider the options afforded by this bill.\u201d</p> <p>While campaigning for prime minister, Trudeau made clear his intentions to reverse the recalcitrant position of Stephen Harper\u2019s preceding government, which refused to address legalization even after the Canadian supreme court ended a ban against it in February 2015 and gave government a one-year window to develop regulations. The new legislation is astute politics for Trudeau; a vast majority of Canada\u2019s citizens have <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/6442/canadians-ethics-euthanasia.aspx\">supported</a> legalization for more than a decade.</p> <p>At the New York Times website Thursday, on an <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/15/world/americas/canadian-prime-minister-seeks-to-legalize-physician-assistedsuicide.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;_r=1\">article</a> about the Canadian announcement, a Louisiana doctor commented that, \u201cIt\u2019s humbling and very human when we cannot control the manner and method of our death.\u201d Aid in dying laws, he admitted made him uncomfortable: \u201cWhat I struggle with is my professional obligation not to harm my patients.\u201d </p> <p>Seeing end-of-life pain as a preventable harm is something many in the church and the medical field are not yet ready to do.</p>",

But this argument again relies on a sentimentalization of patients\u2019 last weeks and days. Others, like California governor Jerry Brown, support legalization only after weighing personal preferences. \u201cIn the end, I was left to reflect on what I would want in the face of my own death,\u201d he wrote in a statement after signing Death with Dignity into law, \u201cI don\u2019t know what I would do if I were dying in prolonged and excruciating pain. I am certain, however, that it would be a comfort to be able to consider the options afforded by this bill.\u201d While campaigning for prime minister, Trudeau made clear his intentions to reverse the recalcitrant position of Stephen Harper\u2019s preceding government, which refused to address legalization even after the Canadian supreme court ended a ban against it in February 2015 and gave government a one-year window to develop regulations. The new legislation is astute politics for Trudeau; a vast majority of Canada\u2019s citizens have supported legalization for more than a decade. At the New York Times website Thursday, on an article about the Canadian announcement, a Louisiana doctor commented that, \u201cIt\u2019s humbling and very human when we cannot control the manner and method of our death.\u201d Aid in dying laws, he admitted made him uncomfortable: \u201cWhat I struggle with is my professional obligation not to harm my patients.\u201d Seeing end-of-life pain as a preventable harm is something many in the church and the medical field are not yet ready to do.",

Its promise to do away with new infrastructure projects for fossil fuels, such as pipelines, rankled the NDP in Alberta \u2013 one of the few places in Canada where NDP hold power \u2013 and highlighted the tensions that exist among Canada\u2019s left among those pushing for climate change action and labour activists who point to the significant number of jobs that continue to be tied to the extractive economy. \u201cThe government of Alberta repudiates the sections of that document that address energy infrastructure,\u201d Rachel Notley, the premier of Alberta \u2013 where slumping oil prices sent unemployment rates to a 20-year high earlier this year \u2013 told reporters this week. \u201cThese ideas will never form any part of policy. They are naive. They are ill-informed. They are tone deaf.\u201d Lewis saw Notley\u2019s stance as a reflection of Alberta politics. Public pressure has ramped up on the premier and her government to push for a pipeline that could get the province\u2019s oil to tidewater, despite opposition from various parts of the country. \u201cThe Alberta government doesn\u2019t have a leap manifesto problem,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cThey have a pipeline problem with other parts of the country that don\u2019t want them and they feel that it is politically critical for them to advance this.\u201d The party should be wary of focusing their attention overwhelmingly on tackling climate change at the expense of other issues such as inequality or housing, said Ed Broadbent, who led the federal NDP for 14 years starting in 1975. As parties on both the right and left of the Canadian political spectrum debate their future directions, a major challenge will be for the party to keep the pressure on the Liberals. The NDP\u2019s role as the conscience of Canadian politics is all the more crucial at this moment, he said, given the growing appetite around the world for leftist alternatives. \u201cThere\u2019s a real openness on the left of ordinary people demanding change \u2026 of wanting elite structures to be totally challenged in a way that was not the case 15 years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s astonishing that in the US now fully 35% of Americans under the age of 30 think socialism is a good thing. Who would have predicted that even five years ago?\u201d",

Rome is a town in turmoil, its population dropping in recent decades as jobs dry up. Lots of large factory buildings and shops lay empty with for lease signs in the window. </p> <p>\u201cIs anybody working up here?\u201d asked Donald Trump, just minutes after he appeared on stage. He rattled off the numbers: 60% of manufacturing jobs gone in the county since 1980. The crowd booed. Forty percent of manufacturing jobs gone since 2001. Median household income in New York state is $3700 less than per year than it was in 1989, said Trump.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d he asked. When he spoke about the loss of manufacturing jobs, a supporter yelled out \u201cbullshit!\u201d in anger.</p> <p>\u201cI agree with you. But I\u2019m not allowed to use that term\u201d replied Trump.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to bring our jobs back,\u201d he declared to loud applause.</p> <p>The airport is a former military base, decommissioned in the 1990s and now used for non combat training. A military plane kept practicing \u201ctouch-and-go\u201d landings as the Trump supporters arrived. Trump turned up an hour late, by which time the hangar was completely full.</p> <p>Unlike last night\u2019s Trump rally in Albany, where around 100 protesters stood outside with posters chanting and fights broke out during the rally, no protesters appeared in Rome and it was a polite, low-key crowd. Even when Trump spoke about the \u201cliars\u201d in the media, and the crowd turned their thumbs down at the media pen, rather than flipping them the bird.</p> <p>Trump continued his anger from last night in Albany about the \u201c\u201drigged\u201d Republican electoral process in Colorado, where he said he was the victim of a \u201ccrooked deal,\u201d since Ted Cruz won all 34 Colorado delegates on the weekend.</p> <p>\u201cThe RNC, the Republican National Convention, should be ashamed of themselves for allowing this kind of crap to happen,\u201d said Trump. \u201cBecause it has nothing to do with democracy.\u201d He said Republicans were burning up their membership cards in anger at the process.</p> <p>\u201cI think the Republicans have a worse system than the democrats. It\u2019s a crooked system,\u201d said Trump.</p> <p>Some of his supporters agreed with his claims against the electoral system. Jacob Shade, 60, drove over two hours from his home in Rochester to attend Trump\u2019s rally today.</p> <p>\u201cThe Republican party wants to be controlled by the elite and do what the elite wants. And they don\u2019t want Trump, because Trump is not one of them,\u201d he told The Guardian.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s not a politician, he\u2019s a businessman, and that\u2019s what we need to get us out of debt,\u201d added his friend Valerie Goodhew, 65, a retired B&amp;B operator, also from Rochester.</p> <p>\u201cI pray every day for this man, because I know the power force in this country does not want to see him as president.

          "bodyText": "As we ride the rails down the Hudson River valley back from Bernie Sanders\u2019 rally in Poughkeepsie - if you\u2019ve never done it, you are missing out - let\u2019s recap another day in American campaign politics that took us from the Capitol to the Bronx to the hinterlands of upstate New York. House speaker Paul Ryan categorically declared that he will not serve as a \u201cwhite knight\u201d presidential nominee in the increasingly likely event of a contested Republican convention this summer, in a speech aimed at halting speculation that Ryan was positioning himself as a consensus candidate who might win the nomination by acclamation. \u201cLet me be clear: I do not want, nor will I accept the Republican nomination,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cIf no candidate has a majority on the first ballot, I believe [the delegates] should only choose a person who actually participated in the primary. Count me out.\u201d Ryan\u2019s office thoughtfully linked to his full remarks, allowing countless political journalists to scour fruitlessly for some glimmer of a loophole. Meanwhile, an actual presidential candidate declared that the upcoming convention will practically be a cakewalk. \u201cI\u2019m gonna have a ton of delegates, Donald\u2019s gonna have a ton of delegates. And the question is who can win a majority of delegates,\u201d declared Texas senator Ted Cruz. \u201cWhere do the Rubio and Kasich delegates go? And I think they\u2019re going to come to us.\u201d Also-running candidate John Kasich told a campaign rally audience that the Republican base\u2019s flirtation with certain other candidates puts the nation on a \u201cpath to darkness\u201d which he called \u201cthe antithesis of all America has meant for 240 years.\u201d Speaking of, billionaire Republican frontrunner Donald Trump angrily declared that his recent delegate snafus aren\u2019t the result of poor ground operations or maladroit backroom maneuverings, but of a \u201cscam\u201d primary system put together by an RNC chair who wants to defraud the voting public. \u201cIt\u2019s a disgrace for the party,\u201d Trump said in an interview with the Hill this afternoon \u201cAnd Reince Priebus should be ashamed of himself. He should be ashamed of himself because he knows what\u2019s going on.\u201d At a campaign rally at Marist College in Poughkeepsie, New York, Vermont senator Bernie Sanders fired up the mostly college-aged crowd by assuring them that \u201cDonald Trump will not become president of the United States.\u201d After declaring that \u201cthe American people will not support a candidate who insults Mexicans and Latinos, who insults Muslims, who insults women, who insults veterans, who insults the African-American community,\u201d Sanders used Trump\u2019s own most valuable asset - his name - against him. \u201cThe American people understand that coming together always trumps dividing us up. Supporting others always trumps selfishness! At the end of the day, love trumps hatred!\u201d That\u2019s it for today from the campaign trail - be sure to tune in tomorrow for more up-to-the-minute campaign coverage from the Guardian\u2019s team of rockstar campaign journalists. Rome was built in a day - at least if you\u2019re talking about Donald Trump\u2019s rally in upstate New York. With just 24 hours notice, around 5,000 people turned up into a freezing cold airport hangar at Griffiss International Airport in Rome, New York to hear the billionaire candidate promise to bring jobs back to the struggling town. This was a supportive Trump audience. Rome is a town in turmoil, its population dropping in recent decades as jobs dry up. Lots of large factory buildings and shops lay empty with for lease signs in the window. \u201cIs anybody working up here?\u201d asked Donald Trump, just minutes after he appeared on stage. He rattled off the numbers: 60% of manufacturing jobs gone in the county since 1980. The crowd booed. Forty percent of manufacturing jobs gone since 2001. Median household income in New York state is $3700 less than per year than it was in 1989, said Trump. \u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d he asked. When he spoke about the loss of manufacturing jobs, a supporter yelled out \u201cbullshit!\u201d in anger. \u201cI agree with you. But I\u2019m not allowed to use that term\u201d replied Trump. \u201cWe\u2019re going to bring our jobs back,\u201d he declared to loud applause. The airport is a former military base, decommissioned in the 1990s and now used for non combat training. A military plane kept practicing \u201ctouch-and-go\u201d landings as the Trump supporters arrived. Trump turned up an hour late, by which time the hangar was completely full. Unlike last night\u2019s Trump rally in Albany, where around 100 protesters stood outside with posters chanting and fights broke out during the rally, no protesters appeared in Rome and it was a polite, low-key crowd. Even when Trump spoke about the \u201cliars\u201d in the media, and the crowd turned their thumbs down at the media pen, rather than flipping them the bird. Trump continued his anger from last night in Albany about the \u201c\u201drigged\u201d Republican electoral process in Colorado, where he said he was the victim of a \u201ccrooked deal,\u201d since Ted Cruz won all 34 Colorado delegates on the weekend. \u201cThe RNC, the Republican National Convention, should be ashamed of themselves for allowing this kind of crap to happen,\u201d said Trump. \u201cBecause it has nothing to do with democracy.\u201d He said Republicans were burning up their membership cards in anger at the process. \u201cI think the Republicans have a worse system than the democrats. It\u2019s a crooked system,\u201d said Trump. Some of his supporters agreed with his claims against the electoral system. Jacob Shade, 60, drove over two hours from his home in Rochester to attend Trump\u2019s rally today. \u201cThe Republican party wants to be controlled by the elite and do what the elite wants. And they don\u2019t want Trump, because Trump is not one of them,\u201d he told The Guardian. \u201cHe\u2019s not a politician, he\u2019s a businessman, and that\u2019s what we need to get us out of debt,\u201d added his friend Valerie Goodhew, 65, a retired B&amp;B operator, also from Rochester. \u201cI pray every day for this man, because I know the power force in this country does not want to see him as president. So I pray to God and he may be our Sirius. God may have given us another chance to turn around and get away from all the evil we\u2019ve sunken to,\u201d she added. In an interview with the Hill this afternoon, billionaire Republican frontrunner Donald Trump dissed Reince Priebus, chair of the Republican National Committee, and claimed that the Republican party\u2019s primary process is a \u201cscam\u201d and a \u201cdisgrace.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a disgrace for the party,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd Reince Priebus should be ashamed of himself. He should be ashamed of himself because he knows what\u2019s going on.\u201d Trump went on to declare that the Colorado state Republican convention, in which opponent Ted Cruz emerged as the universal victor, was a fraud. \u201cIt should go to a vote in Colorado like other places,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe best way to do it would be just a vote, should be a vote of the people. That\u2019s the way it should be done. The delegate situation is a very unjust way of doing things.\u201d New Jersey senator Cory Booker has joined forced with senators Jeff Merkley of Oregon, Mark Kirk of Illinois, Patrick Leahy of Vermont, Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and Patty Murray of Washington in writing a letter to NBA commissioner Adam Silver urging him to move the 2017 NBA All-Star game away from Charlotte, North Carolina, after the state\u2019s governor signed a controversial bill stripping all LGBT North Carolinians of protection from discrimination. \u201cMillions of Americans and millions more people around the world look up to the NBA,\u201d the senators wrote in the letter. \u201cThe NBA boasts one of the most multicultural and multiethnic groups of players of any sports league in the world with more than 100 international players on its rosters. The NBA also made history just two years ago this month when Jason Collins became the first openly gay athlete to play in a major American professional sports league.\u201d The senators\u2019 call for a new location is in response to the passage of HB2, which prevents local governments from passing any ordinances that would give their LGBT residents or visitors non-discrimination protections, and legally bars transgender people from using public restrooms that comport with their own gender identity. \u201cWe hold no ill-will towards the people of Charlotte, who passed an antidiscrimination measure that HB2 overturned, nor towards the people of North Carolina,\u201d the letter continues. \u201cHowever, we cannot condone nor stand idly by as North Carolina moves to legalize and institutionalize discrimination against the LGBT community. Nor should the NBA allow its premier annual event to be hosted in such a state. Doing so, we believe, would be inconsistent with the NBA\u2019s history and values. Therefore, we echo the words of NBA Hall of Famer Charles Barkley and call on the NBA to move the All-Star game from Charlotte.\u201d The NBA has not yet commented on the letter. Merrick Garland, Barack Obama\u2019s US supreme court selection, has apparently failed to persuade Senate judiciary committee chair Chuck Grassley during a private meeting earlier today to hold confirmation hearings on his nomination. \u201cAs he indicated last week, Grassley explained why the Senate won\u2019t be moving forward during this hyper-partisan election year,\u201d Grassley\u2019s office said in a statement, which described the meeting as \u201ccordial and pleasant\u201d. The two men met for 70 minutes in the Senate dining room. The Iowa Republican two decades ago also sought to block Garland\u2019s nomination to the federal appeals court on which he currently serves as chief judge. Garland later met privately with Lisa Murkowski, one of the dwindling number of moderate Senate Republicans. Her office issued a statement that also seemed to close the door on confirming Garland. Bernie Sanders, in his closing remarks, calls for the assembled fans to push for \u201cthe largest voter turnout in New York history.\u201d \u201cTogether we can make it happen! Thank you!\u201d In an aggressive push against the current frontrunner for the Republican nomination, Bernie Sanders calls out Donald Trump as a divider - and reminds the crowd that good always trumps evil. \u201cLet me assure you of something that I know makes millions of Americans very nervous, and that is Donald Trump will not become president of the United States.\u201d The audience absolutely loses its mind, stamping feet, cheering, whistling, booing and breaking into a \u201cBernie! Bernie! Bernie!\u201d chant. \u201cAnd that\u2019s because every national poll has me beating him by double digits!\u201d Sanders continues. \u201cWe will not become president because the American people will not support a candidate who insults Mexicans and Latinos!\u201d The audience cheers. \u201cWho insults Muslims! The audience cheers. \u201cWho insults women!\u201d The audience cheers. \u201cWho insults veterans!\u201d The audience cheers. \u201cWho insults the African-American community!\u201d The audience cheers. \u201cThe American people understand that we are a great nation because of our diversity,\u201d Sanders continues. \u201cThe American people understand that coming together always trumps dividing us up. Supporting others always trumps selfishness!\u201d \u201cThe American people understand very deeply what every major religion on earth has told us,\u201d Sanders says. \u201cAnd what they have all taught is that at the end of the day, love trumps hatred.\u201d \u201cBERNIE!\u201d \u201cBERNIE!\u201d \u201cBERNIE!\u201d the audience chants. \u201cI have been criticized throughout this campaign for saying something, so I will say it again: In my view, healthcare is a right of all people, not a privilege,\u201d Sanders says, to more feet-stopming and cheering. \u201cThe Affordable Care Act has done a lot of good things, but we must go beyond the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Sanders continues, \u201cWhen 29m americans have no health insurance - even more are underinsured with high deductibles - when we are getting ripped off every day by the drug companies who charge us the highest prices, we need to move toward a Medicare for all, single-payer system.\u201d \u201cThis campaign is listening to young people,\u201d Bernie Sanders tells the largely college-aged crowd. \u201cIf you take a deep breath, and you think outside of the box, ask yourselves, why we would be punishing millions of people for getting an education?\u201d Sanders says of student-loan debt. \u201cWe should be rewarding people, not punishing them!\u201d \u201cToday, in many respects, a college degree is the equivalent of what a high school degree was 50 years ago,\u201d Sanders says. \u201cAnd that is why I believe that in the year 2016, we have got to rethink what we mean by public education. It is no longer good enough to conceive of public education as first grade through 12th grade. We need to make public colleges and universities tuition free!\u201d The students at Marist, where tuition and fees run $32,590, applaud louder than they have all night. \u201cI will tell you how we are gonna pay for it,\u201d Sanders says. \u201cWe are gonna impose a tax on Wall Street speculation. When Wall Street\u2019s greed nearly destroyed our economy, Congress bailed them out. Now it\u2019s time for Wall Street to help out our working families.\u201d Bernie Sanders highlights his campaign\u2019s record-shattering number of small donations, and opponent Hillary Clinton\u2019s less sterling, in his view, willingness to accept money from large corporations. \u201cWe are showing that we can run a winning national campaign without powerful special-interest money,\u201d Sanders says. \u201cSecretary Clinton has chosen another route in terms of how she raises her money. She has several super-PACS,\u201d he says, a fact that is booed loudly. \u201cShe spoke to Goldman Sachs on more than one occasion and received $250,000 a speech.\u201d Huge booing breaks out in the audience. \u201cWhat I think is if you get paid $225,000 for a speech, must be a pretty great speech, don\u2019t you think?\u201d he says, as the audience laughs. \u201cI mean, I can\u2019t think of any other reason why they would pay for that! Must be a speech which resolve many of the great international crises that we face. Must be an enlightening speech which clarifies the crises facing our planet. Must be a speech given in Shakespearean prose!\u201d \u201cI am preparing to release all of the transcripts of all of the speeches that I gave to Wall Street,\u201d Sanders says, a proposition that he calls \u201ca little bit silly\u201d because \u201cas you all know, there were no speeches, so there are no transcripts.\u201d \u201cMy cell phone is on! I\u2019m awaiting an invitation!\u201d Bernie Sanders, on super-PACS: Our job is to take these powerful special interests on - not take their money! \u201cWhy have I bored you with this short historical lesson?\u201d Bernie Sanders asks rhetorically. \u201cThe reason is to show you that when people stand up and fight back, change can and does happen!\u201d The audience leaps to its feet with a \u201cBernie! Bernie! Bernie!\u201d chant as a group of unapologetic #BernieBros hoots. \u201cPeople are looking at the status quo, and they are beginning to realize that not only is the status quo not working for ordinary Americans, they are realizing that the status quo has to change, and that change will not come about through establishment politics and economics.\u201d Bernie Sanders riffs on the theme of expanding equality for people of color, women and LGBT Americans. \u201cBecause of the strong activism of the gay community and their straight allies,\u201d for example, \u201cgay marriage was made legal by a very conservative supreme court, because the American people told them that was the right thing to do.\u201d \u201cWhat this campaign is about is not just electing a new president,\u201d Sanders says. \u201cIt is about transforming America.\u201d \u201cLet me tell you what no other candidate for president will tell you: And that is no president, not even Bernie Sanders, can do it alone,\u201d Sanders continues. \u201cThe only way we take [Wall Street] on is when millions of people stand up, fight back and demand equality.\u201d The thousands-strong crowd, stomping its feet in the arena bleachers, chants \u201cBernie! Bernie! Bernie!\u201d \u201cThat is what the political revolution is about,\u201d Sanders continues. \u201cDemocracy is not a spectator sport.\u201d \u201cWe do not have to accept the reality of today - that people are working two or three jobs just to bring in enough healthcare and income to support their families,\u201d Sanders says, as a woman in the audience shouts \u201cYES!\u201d \u201cWe have got to fight for a nation in which people can earn enough income without having to work 50, 60, 70 hours a week,\u201d he continues, to loud and sustained whistles and applause. \u201cToday on Wall Street alone, the six largest financial institutions have assets of over $10 trillion, equivalent of 50% of the GDP of the United States of America,\u201d Sanders says, to loud boos. \u201cFDR wanted to see a nation free of monopoly control, free of outrageous concentration of wealth and power - he gave that speech in 1944. We still have not achieved that goal.\u201d Bernie Sanders describes to the audience at Marist College \u201cwhat we are entitled to as members of a civil democratic society: The right to adequate food, clothing and time off from work!\u201d Bernie Sanders begins his speech by highlighting the accomplishment of another president who called the Hudson River Valley home: Franklin Delano Roosevelt, whose home in Hyde Park is only a few miles away. \u201cHe saw millions of people unemployed and hungry, he saw farmers losing their farms, he saw people struggling every single day to get the health care they needed or education for their kids, and he came forward, and he said, you know what? We are going to transform the way government works in America.\u201d The crowd cheers wildly. \u201cAnd that is what he did!\u201d Sanders quotes Roosevelt\u2019s so-called \u201cSecond Bill of Rights,\u201d in which the president told Congress that the political rights guaranteed by the Constitution had \u201cproved inadequate to assure us equality in the pursuit of happiness.\u201d \u201cThis is one of the most important speeches ever made by a president,\u201d Sanders says. \u201c\u2018We have come to a clear realization of the fact that true individual freedom cannot exist without economic security and independence,\u2019\u201d he quoted Roosevelt. \u201cThat is a very profound thought.\u201d To raucous cheers and almost an hour behind schedule, Vermont senator and Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has taken the stage at Marist College\u2019s McCann Arena. Sanders was introduced by Michael Stipe, of REM, as the candidate \u201con the right side of history.\u201d \u201cWe have the profound capacity to become the great country that we imagine - but to do that, we need a caring, tough and straight-talking leader,\u201d Stipe said. \u201cThis is our time - let\u2019s not blow it!\u201d Sanders declared. The New York Daily News, an iconic tabloid newspaper in New York City, has endorsed former secretary of state and New York senator Hillary Clinton\u2019s bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, summing up the reasoning behind supporting the former first lady as a question of economic stewardship. \u201cShe or he must ignite and rebalance the United States economy in favor of the many while also extending an extra helping hand to ease burdens that have grown too heavy for some,\u201d the paper\u2019s editorial board wrote of the qualifications necessary for the next president of the United States, adding that \u201cClinton is unsparingly clear-eyed about what\u2019s wrong with America while holding firm to what\u2019s right with America.\u201d \u201cShe fully understands the toll that adverse economic forces have taken on the country,\u201d the editorial continues. \u201cShe is supremely knowledgeable about the powers a President can wield to lift fortunes in need of lifting. She possesses the strength and the shrewdness to confront the tough politics of advancing an ambitious Democratic agenda in the White House.\u201d \u201cStill more, she is a cauldron-tested globalist who had the spine to give Obama a thumb\u2019s up for taking out Osama Bin Laden and who is far the wiser about the use of American power, having served as secretary of state and seen the consequences of the war in Iraq.\u201d Of Clinton\u2019s primary opponent, Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, the paper declared that his meeting with its editorial board showed him to be not ready for the presidency. \u201cSubjected to meaningful scrutiny for the first time, the senator from Vermont proved utterly unprepared for the Oval Office while confirming that the central thrusts of his campaign are politically impossible.\u201d Not every supporter of Bernie Sanders is a Democrat - although, to be fair, neither is Sanders himself. Michelle Belanger, a Poughkeepsie local, told the Guardian that she is a registered Republican, but that the combination of dissatisfaction with the makeup of the current Republican field and her outrage over the terrorist attacks at the American consulate in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012 have motivated her to advocate on behalf of Sanders. \u201cI\u2019m here because I\u2019m actually a registered Republican, buy I believe in what Bernie believe in,\u201d Belanger said. \u201cBenghazi makes me very angry - she\u2019s all about money in her pocket. Bernie, you can\u2019t buy him.\u201d Belanger acknoledged that, as a registered Republican, she can\u2019t vote for Sanders in the Democratic primary next week, but she has changed the minds of Democratic friends on Facebook. \u201cIn the presidential election, if it\u2019s [Donald] Trump versus Bernie, Bernie\u2019s got my vote,\u201d Belanger said. And if it\u2019s Clinton versus Trump? \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m afraid of,\u201d she said with a groan. \u201cI still don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d Now mounting the stage, clad in a New York Yankees cap, anti-fracking activist Josh Fox, director of the Academy Award-nominated documentary Gasland, who shouts to the audience that \u201cwe are here to take our party back!\u201d Lambasting former secretary of state as a tool of the fossil fuel industry, Fox says that Bernie Sanders is the only candidate who \u201cunderstands that the anti-fracking movement is the political revolution of today.\u201d \u201cBernie Sanders is here to stand up with you against Big Oil for a better future - and he\u2019s the only candidate who had the foresight to stop and protest against the Iraq War,\u201d Fox says. \u201c[Clinton\u2019s] state department promoted fracking all over the world,\u201d Fox continues, \u201cpushing fracking in 30 countries worldwide.\u201d \u201cDo we want 30 to 40 more years of frack-gas power plants across the United States?\u201d Fox asks rhetorically. \u201cDo we want hundreds of pipelines criss-crossing the United States?\u201d The audience shouts \u201cNO!\u201d \u201cThere is only one candidate who is standing up against the frackers. Who is it?\u201d \u201cBernie!\u201d \u201cThere is only one candidate who does not take money from the fossil-fuel industry. Who is it?\u201d \u201cBernie!\u201d \u201cWhat Bernie Sanders does is bring everybody together,\u201d Rice continues. \u201cWhether you\u2019re black, white, latino, straight, gay, male, or female, we\u2019re all in this movement together. We all love Bernie.\u201d \u201cEven the birds love Bernie!\u201d Jared Rice, the deputy mayor of New Rochelle, New York, and the first elected official to come out for Bernie Sanders in Hillary Clinton\u2019s native Westchester County, has taken the stage here at Marist College, telling the crowd of Sanders supporters that \u201cthis is the reality - and [the establishment] needs to fall in line.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to challenge the establishment,\u201d Rice says, \u201cbut we have to challenge the establishment to do better, because they have to.\u201d \u201cThis momentum is not just limited today here at Marist College,\u201d he continues. \u201cI\u2019ve been in the Bronx, I\u2019ve been in Harlem, I\u2019ve been in Westchester - and they\u2019re all saying the same thing: We\u2019re tired of establishment politics, and we\u2019re tired of establishment economics!\u201d The crowd goes wild. Not everyone who turns up at a Donald Trump rally plans to vote for him. \u201cI\u2019m a registered Republican, but I won\u2019t vote for Trump. He\u2019s crazy. He sat in there for an hour and made people scream up and down, but he never said anything,\u201d said Pete Palleschi, 19, business management student at Hudson Valley Community College, minutes after the Trump rally in Albany ended. The Guardian pointed out that Pete is wearing the classic red Make America Great Again hat (which he removed for the photo). \u201cHe\u2019s here for the show,\u201d said his friend Joe Oleynek, 19. Oleynek filmed the Guardian - and the counter protesters outside the Trump rally - live on Periscope throughout the interview. \u201cI\u2019m going to show this [hat] to my kids one day. Remember that crazy guy Donald Trump who almost won the presidency? They probably won\u2019t even know it because it\u2019ll be forgotten,\u201d said Palleschi. They were part of a group of 10 college guys who\u2019d come together to soak up Trumpmania. Palleschi said he was a Rand Paul fan but will probably vote Kasich. Oleynek is a registered Green Party voter, so won\u2019t vote in the primaries but considers himself a combined Bernie Sanders and Trump fan. \u201cIf it\u2019s between Bernie and Trump I\u2019ll have to flip a coin. Like a true American,\u201d he quipped. Many of the spectators at today\u2019s Bernie Sanders rally in Poughkeepsie, New York, are students at Marist College - or, in the case of Renee Springage-Lewis, staff members. \u201cI believe in his mission to bring us together - he stands for the people,\u201d Springage-Lewis, who works in the college\u2019s enrollment services department, told the Guardian. \u201cHe\u2019s talking about issues that are outside the norm.\u201d Jackson Rockefeller, a student majoring in political science, agreed. \u201cFree college tuition - who else has mentioned that?\u201d Rockefeller said. \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily agree with it, but he\u2019s getting that conversation started. Tuition is really frikken\u2019 high, and we have to solve it so the next generation can get the ball rolling.\u201d \u201cDonald Trump is the father-in-law of the Observer\u2019s publisher. That is not a reason to endorse him. Giving millions of disillusioned Americans a renewed sense of purpose and opportunity is.\u201d So begins the New York Observer\u2019s endorsement of billionaire Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy for the party\u2019s nomination, which cites \u201cthe profound alienation, anger and disillusionment of millions\u201d as the fuel of Trump\u2019s rabid popularity. The paper\u2019s editorial board cites his putative unpopularity with the news media as evidence of his \u201coptimism.\u201d \u201cThroughout his career, Donald Trump has demonstrated real leadership,\u201d the editorial continues. \u201cCritics, particularly in the media, are quick to point out Mr. Trump\u2019s less successful ventures: Trump University, Atlantic City casinos, Trump Airlines and branded products such as vodka and steaks. Having tried (and sometimes failed) at our own entrepreneurial ventures, we are far more inclined to put these ventures into perspective. As Robert Kennedy said, \u2018Only those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly.\u2019\u201d We\u2019re coming at you live from Poughkeepsie, New York, home of sterling Gilded Age mansions, the longest footbridge in the world and Marist College, where Vermont senator and Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders is set to speak to a lively audience of students, faculty and upstate New Yorkers at 7 pm. The mood is festive here at the McCann Arena, where the crowd - young, diverse and decked out in a wide variety of Sanders swag - has taken to spontaneous chants of \u201cBernie! Bernie! Bernie!\u201d in anticipation of the candidate\u2019s appearance. The rally, billed as a \u201cFuture to Believe In Rally\u201d by the campaign, is expected to emphasize college affordability and student-loan debt reduction, topics that the Sanders campaign has brought to the fore of the Democratic race. Donald Trump probably appreciates the hustle. Blaine Taylor, 62, was unemployed until he started selling Trump T-shirts and hats outside Trump rallies across the country. His $10 Trump T-shirts read: \u201cFire the idiots, help the vets\u201d and \u201cFinally someone with balls.\u201d For $20 you can buy the iconic Make America Great Again red cap. He got into the Trump merch business after attending a rally. \u201cI saw everybody else selling them and I thought \u2018if they can do it, I can too\u2019.\u201d Now he and his brother drive across the country to Trump rallies, clocking up around 15-20 events so far, he says. Last night they sold 1,000 shirts at the Trump rally in Albany. \u201cIt\u2019s really good cash,\u201d said Taylor, standing in the carpark outside a rally in Rome, New York. He wouldn\u2019t give a figure on how much he was bringing in - and noted that he had to spend money on hotels, gas, etc. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be on the move. You don\u2019t know much ahead of time,\u201d he said. While talking to The Guardian, a local sheriff came over. \u201cNo more sales, this is a private facility,\u201d said the Sheriff, telling Taylor to move along. That\u2019s pretty standard says Taylor, who says he\u2019s yet to be arrested. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be very careful. I have been warned as many as three times, I continue to sell but I was looking all the time, one eye open, one eye trying to sell.\u201d But right now Blaine figures he\u2019s still got a few more months of employment - \u201cuntil he becomes president.\u201d And how does it rate as a job? \u201cIt\u2019s pretty good. Better than not having anything!\u201d replied Taylor. Coffee break! In a moment, I\u2019ll be liveblogging Vermont senator Bernie Sanders\u2019 rally at the McCann Arena at Marist College in Poughkeepsie, New York, where the presidential candidate will be speaking to the kind of young, college-educated crowd with which he has found so much success. I\u2019ll be back online shortly, but in the meantime, here are a few great political reads from our intrepid team of reporters today: Cruz Country: who are Ted Cruz\u2019s supporters in New York? The Texas senator alienated voters early on with his \u2018New York values\u2019 remark, but some Long Island residents would still prefer him to Trump in the primary. North Carolina governor refuses to reverse anti-LGBT law in executive order. Pat McCrory expands equal employment policy to include sexual orientation and gender and says he will ask lawmakers to restore right to sue over discrimination. John Kasich urges Republicans to choose him over path of \u2018darkness.\u2019 Without mentioning Ted Cruz or Donald Trump by name, Ohio governor condemns \u2018path that turns fear into hatred\u2019 in New York City speech. Here\u2019s full video of Paul Ryan\u2019s press conference this afternoon: \u201cSo, let me say again, I\u2019m not going to be our party\u2019s nominee,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cBut I\u2019ll also be clear about something else: Not running does not mean I\u2019m going to disappear.\u201d In non-speaker-related news, former secretary of state and current Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton is taking a page from Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau, telling Cosmopolitan in an interview that if she\u2019s elected, she will appoint a 50%-female presidential cabinet. \u201cThat is certainly my goal,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cA very diverse cabinet representing the talents and experience of the entire country. And since we are a 50-50 country, I would aim to have a 50-50 cabinet.\u201d Trudeau won praise when he was elected prime minister for making his cabinet 50% female, telling reporters at the time that \u201cIt\u2019s important to be here before you today to present to Canada a cabinet that looks like Canada.\u201d Asked to explain his gender parity promise, he answered: \u201cBecause it\u2019s 2015.\u201d Paul Ryan\u2019s office has thoughtfully linked to his full remarks, allowing countless political journalists to scour fruitlessly for some glimmer of a loophole. Here\u2019s the key graph: We have too much work to do in the House to allow this speculation swirl or have my motivations questioned. Let me be clear: I do not want, nor will I accept the Republican nomination. So let me speak directly to the delegates on this: If no candidate has a majority on the first ballot, I believe you should only choose a person who actually participated in the primary. Count me out. \u201cI will not allow my name, I am opposed to put my name in place\u201d for the nomination, Ryan says. He says only someone who ran should be nominated. But he stops short of saying it should be one of the three still in the race. Paul Ryan says: \u201cCount me out.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve got a message to relay today. We\u2019ve got too much work to do in the House to allow this speculation to swirl... \u201cI do not want nor will I accept the nomination for our party. Let me speak directly to the delegates... \u201cIf no candidate has a majority on the first ballot, I believe that you should only choose from a person who has actually participated in a primary. Count me out. \u201cI chose not to do this. Therefore, I should not be considered, period, end of story... I am not going to be our party\u2019s nominee.\u201d Here comes Ryan. Paul Ryan is scheduled to speak in a few minutes on how much he intends not to be the 2016 Republican nominee. You can watch here: When the rap metal band Rage Against Machine recorded its 1992 album Rage Against the Machine, it was not thinking \u201crage against the machine\u201d like how a billionaire running for president in the future might complain about rules for awarding convention delegates (not that such a person might not be pretty ticked). That\u2019s what RATM guitarist Tom Morello is now claiming: Ohio governor John Kasich issued a sharp rebuke of his rival campaigns\u2019 mud-slinging tactics in an impassioned speech just one week ahead of the New York primary, while outlining his vision of what American values and leadership should look like ahead of one of the most \u201cconsequential elections\u201d in recent memory, writes the Guardian\u2019s Raya Jalabi: Speaking to a polite establishment crowd of roughly 100 people on Tuesday, mostly New York Republicans gathered at the historic Women\u2019s National Republican Club in Manhattan, Kasich reiterated his plea that the US not fall prey to the fear-mongering demagoguery and \u201chollow promises\u201d of his rivals, who he said \u201cwere not worthy of the office they are seeking\u201d. The event was billed as a cornerstone speech intended to underline Kasich\u2019s experience and even-handed approach as the prospect of a contested convention looms. In it he detailed the two paths he believes lie ahead for the US, which contrasted his own candidacy with the \u201cdarkness\u201d of the unpredictable Donald Trump and fiercely ideological Ted Cruz. \u201cThe path that exploits anger, encourages resentment, turns fear into hatred and divides people. This path solves nothing and demeans our history and weakens our country and cheapens each one of us. It has but one beneficiary, and that is the politician who speaks of it,\u201d Kasich said in a reference to the two leading Republican candidates. This path, he said, \u201cdrags us into a ditch and won\u2019t make America great again\u201d. Read the full piece here: Ladies and gentlemen, Bono, on Capitol Hill to testify about violent extremists and foreign aid. Police arrested more than 400 protesters outside the U.S. Capitol on Monday from Democracy Spring, an organization seeking to remove big money from politics and combat restrictive voter identification laws, Reuters reported: The mostly calm and orderly demonstration resulted in arrests for what the U.S. Capitol Police called \u201cunlawful demonstration activity\u201d such as crowding and obstruction. Organizers vowed to repeat the demonstration every day for a week. The protest was held \u201cto demand Congress take immediate action to end the corruption of big money in our politics and ensure free and fair elections,\u201d Democracy Spring said on its website. The group lists actor Mark Ruffalo and academic Noam Chomsky and dozens of well-known activist groups among its supporters. \u201cWe believe this is the people\u2019s house, and Congress should be responsive to the people. We need to protect voting rights,\u201d said Peter Callahan, the group\u2019s communications coordinator. Read further here. The Guardian\u2019s Amber Jamieson is attending a Trump rally in Rome, New York, today after catching a Trump rally last night in Albany, where she met Ron Richards, 27. Richards proudly wore a T-shirt depicting Hillary Clinton as Hitler, as a middle finger to the Trump protesters who compare the presidential wannabe to the Nazi leader, Amber writes: \u201cThese people over here [points to anti-Trump protests] profiling Trump as racist and like Hitler, it\u2019s just as bad,\u201d said Richards, an electrical engineer from Saratoga Springs. \u201cTrump hasn\u2019t killed anybody. Hillary has killed many people throughout her offices. It\u2019s crazy. But no I don\u2019t think she\u2019s Hitler, I don\u2019t believe she\u2019s a mass murder. But she\u2019s killed people \u2013 just like Obama has killed people, just like Bush has killed people. \u201cBut for someone to say that Trump is Hitler is asinine, he hasn\u2019t killed anybody, he\u2019s not even causing mass genocide or anything like that. It\u2019s insane.\u201d The Guardian mentioned that Trump was talking about a religious test for entering the United States and had emerged as a favorite among white supremacists. \u201cMuslim is not a religion,\u201d replied Richards\u2019 friend Cameron, 33, an electrical engineer from Glens Fall, who declined to give his last name. \u201cIslam is. Muslim is not,\u201d said Cameron. \u201cHe\u2019s not the first person to ever do that and/or consider that idea. One of our presidents had actually done a ban on certain race during war time, I can\u2019t remember the name of the president,\u201d said Richards. \u201cThey gathered up people during World War II. Ellis Island used to screen people so they don\u2019t have tuberculosis. I don\u2019t see any reason why you can\u2019t screen people before they come into the country. It\u2019s not being racist. It\u2019s just saying \u2018hey look let\u2019s do a background check of where you came from, what your ethics are\u2019,\u201d said Cameron. Anti-Trump protesters were yelling that a vote for Trump is a vote for the white power movement. Some Trump supporters were yelling \u201cwhite power\u201d back to them. \u201cI don\u2019t support that in any way. I believe all lives matter. Humanity in general, no particular race,\u201d said Richards. For months, all Donald Trump was doing was winning. But it turns out those wins didn\u2019t mean all that much, writes Guardian political reporter Ben Jacobs: The Republican frontrunner has won 21 states so far in the Republican primary but it has slowly dawned on Trump\u2019s campaign in recent weeks that nearly all of those races were just glorified beauty contests, and that winning the most votes in a state primary may be an accomplishment as valueless as a framed degree from Trump University. Delegates at the Republican National Convention elect the GOP nominee for the presidential ticket and often those delegates aren\u2019t chosen by popular vote. Smart political campaigns, though, have long built delegate operations to prepare for contested conventions. In contrast, Donald Trump has only just started building one in recent weeks and his failure could cost him the Republican nomination. For months, Trump has coasted by with a campaign based on earning media coverage with minimal grassroots organizing. He holds big rallies that draw crowds of thousands before primary elections and then leaves the state. This means that delegate selection, which usually happens in a series of party meetings after a primary election, has been neglected by Trump\u2019s campaign. In recent weeks, Trump has tried to turn things around. ... Read the full piece here: A new poll from Quinnipiac University showed Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump with undiminished leads in the New York race since the last time the poll was taken before the 5 April Wisconsin primary. The poll finds Clinton leading Sanders 53-40 among likely Democratic primary voters, and Trump with 55% support among likely Republicans compared with 20% for Kasich and 19% for Cruz: Today\u2019s results show little movement from a March 31 survey showing Clinton over Sanders 54 - 42 percent and Trump with 56 percent, followed by Cruz at 20 percent and Kasich at 19 percent. Texas senator Ted Cruz is on Glenn Beck\u2019s radio show right now. You can listen live here. Cruz has just repeated his assertion that rival Donald Trump cannot reach a majority of 1,237 delegates in advance of the July convention. \u201cI\u2019m gonna have a ton of delegates, Donald\u2019s gonna have a ton of delegates. And the question is who can win a majority of delegates. \u201cWhere do the Rubio and Kasich delegates go? And I think they\u2019re going to come to us.\u201d Cruz says all the talk of his strong ground game belies the strength of organic voter interest. \u201cOur staffers couldn\u2019t do this if there was not a grassroots tsunami...\u201d Cruz says. \u201cBasically what we\u2019re doing is logistics. We\u2019ve got people saying I\u2019m willing to do whatever I can... it is coming from the people.\u201d Then Cruz handicaps the remainder of the race: \u201cDonald may well have a good about two weeks... New York is his home state. He ought to win his home state convincingly. If Donald is not significantly above 50% it will be a loss for him. \u201cThere\u2019s states like Pennsylvania, states like Maryland where we have tremendous support. ... Donald could have a good couple of weeks. He could get a pretty decent chunk of delegates. \u201cBut then we\u2019re gonna get into states like Indiana, states like Nebraska, states like Montana. \u201cThe whole race is gonna come down to California.\u201d Cruz closes by citing fivethirtyeight.com as giving him good odds to win California. \u201cThey\u2019re very good at what they do. 538 currently has the odds of the Cruz campaign at 61%.\u201d House speaker Paul Ryan has announced an afternoon news conference, and reports based on leaks say that he will absolutely rule out any run at or drift into the White House via a contested Republican convention in July: All three morning candidate events have ended. Kasich has just sent an email fundraising off his speech about \u201ctwo paths\u201d ahead: One is espoused by the other candidates- it\u2019s riddled with negativity about America...it drags us into a ditch and it divides us. The other path is one that I\u2019ve focused my entire campaign on. It\u2019s one that offers American families a positive vision for the future of our country. Has it only been a year since Clinton announced she was running for president? And there are only 209 days to go till the election. This is all happening so quickly. Here\u2019s a transcript of the section of the Kasich speech in which he attacked rivals Ted Cruz and Donald Trump, via CNN: The three candidate events \u2013 Kasich, Sanders, Clinton \u2013 currently running have distinct flavors. The Sanders event is clamorous. The Kasich event is a lecture. The Clinton event feels like a tech conference.. with a baby: \u201cThis path to darkness is the antithesis of all America has meant for 240 years,\u201d Kasich says. \u201cWe can\u2019t sit by idly and expect fate or destiny to ... rescue us. We always roll up our sleeves and get to work when the going gets tough. And we have never ever seen America\u2019s spirit fail. ... The spirit of our country rests in us, all of us. America is still great.\u201d Ohio governor John Kasich has begun his speech laying out \u201ctwo paths\u201d for America. A live stream is here. The Guardian\u2019s Raya Jalabi is in the room. Kasich is attacking Trump: \u201cWhen we come together, when we unite as a country, America always wins... Some who feed off the angers and fears felt by some of us... feed their own insatiable desires for fame or attention. That could drive America down in a ditch, and not make us great again.\u201d Looks like a cozy breakfast this morning between senate judiciary committee chairman Chuck Grassley and judge Merrick Garland, the Supreme Court nominee. Grassley has refused to convene a hearing on Garland\u2019s nomination until the election is over. Sanders is in the section of his stump speech in which he criticizes US trade agreements which he points out Clinton supported. Clinton, meanwhile, has taken a seat at the equal pay roundtable, joining six interlocutors. The talk begins. Clinton has begun her speech on equal pay, to be followed by a roundtable sponsored by Glassdoor, an employment site. There\u2019s a livestream here. We\u2019re looking for an embeddable one. Clinton is saying that pay inequality women is a persistent problem. Sanders applies the line he\u2019s used in other states to New York: if turnout is high, he says, \u201cwe\u2019re going to win here as well.\u201d Bernie Sanders won one more delegate in Colorado than first projected, the Denver Post reports \u2013 and the Colorado Democratic Party has egg on its face. The party misreported the March 1 caucus results from 10 precinct locations, the Post reports. When the newspaper discovered its error, the party \u201cwas shared with... Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign by party officials but kept from Sanders until the Post told his staff Monday night\u201d: The revelation that the state party misreported the results to the public March 1 \u2014 and kept it quiet to all but the Clinton campaign for five weeks \u2014 comes as Sanders promotes his case that he can win the Democratic nomination. And it arises a day after the Colorado Republican Party faces blistering criticism from Donald Trump and his supporters about how it awarded national delegates in what the candidate called a \u201crigged\u201d system. Read the full piece here. Bernie Sanders has just taken the stage in Rochester \u2013 to very big cheers. Here\u2019s a live stream: Hillary Clinton\u2019s arrival at a roundtable on pay equality in New York City has been delayed by rain. The Guardian\u2019s Jana Kasperkevic is at the scene, which you can observe for yourself in the video stream below: Hello and welcome to our live-wire coverage of the race for the White House. Hillary Clinton, John Kasich and Bernie Sanders all have morning events we\u2019ll be covering here: Clinton will participate in a roundtable discussion on pay equality in Manhattan; Sanders hosts a rally in Rochester at 10am and Kasich delivers a speech about the \u201cTwo Paths\u201d facing America at 10.30am. Later Donald Trump will appear in Rome, New York, and Bill Clinton is scheduled to pop up at a couple events in the city. Anyone see today\u2019s NY Daily News? The cover refers to a comedy sketch Clinton and New York City mayor Bill de Blasio performed at a weekend charity event in which the candidate gives the mayor a hard time for taking so long to endorse her. The mayor explains he was on \u201cCPT\u201d, an acronym for \u201ccolored people time\u201d that some in the audience were shocked to hear issue from the mouth of the mayor, who is white. \u201cCautious politician time,\u201d Clinton replied. \u201cI\u2019ve been there\u201d. Also performing in the skit was Leslie Odom Jr, a star of the hit musical Hamilton who is black. Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson extended his reign as Worst Surrogate Ever on Monday by explaining his support for Trump as a blend of pragmatism and desperation: It was pragmatism, recognizing that John Kasich cannot win without a brokered convention \u2014 which would guarantee a Democrat win \u2014 and recognizing that Ted Cruz can bring conservatives but will have a very difficult time bringing moderates and Democrats,\u201d Carson said on Kelley and Kafer. \u201cI think that will be pretty much a guaranteed loss also. So in terms of who can potentially win, I think that would be Donald Trump. When I look at the consequences of not winning, it\u2019s too horrible to even think about.\u201d Thanks for reading and, as always, please join us in the comments.",

In Attawapiskat, as in many First Nations communities across Canada, the despair, poverty and racism of colonialism resurge in the present. The ministers and priests of generations past were so thorough that the plutocrats of today need merely slash a budget here or there and look neglectfully away while the ugly truth of Canada\u2019s foundation reaps what it has sown. \u201cLook at them,\u201d the Conservative talking heads will say, \u201cthey\u2019re killing themselves\u201d.</p> <p>Despite the spate of suicides currently devastating Attawapiskat and slowly churning through aboriginal communities throughout Canada, this First Nation \u2013 like all others \u2013 will endure through the hardship. Against all odds, Canada\u2019s 634 First Nations have survived and even thrived in the face of colonization. Many members of the Attawapiskat community still <a href=\"http://aptn.ca/reelinsights/more-insight/the-people-of-the-kattawapiskak-river/\">speak Swampy Cree</a> and derive their sustenance from the land, as their ancestors have for generations. <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/attawapiskat-four-things-to-help-understand-the-suicidecrisis/article29583059/\">Some critics</a> will say that this wave of suicide is their communities\u2019 failing \u2013 an <a href=\"http://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/DAM/DAM-INTER-HQ/STAGING/texte-text/cp1969_1100100010190_eng.pdf\">old and tired argument</a> that Canada should abandon the reserve system entirely in favor of urban resettlement.</p> <p>But this is not about the wrongs of the Attawapiskat Nation. It is about the wrongs of another. And in Canada\u2019s moment of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/15/justin-trudeau-pledges-reconciliation-canada-aboriginal-abuse\">truth and reconciliation</a> the worth of a nation will be measured by its ability to right this enduring wrong. We can no longer pretend that apologies and public ceremonies are a tacit support for a wholly unjust, unequal and deadly status quo.</p> <p>If Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is sincere in his commitment to build a \u201c<a href=\"http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2015/12/08/trudeau-commits-to-nation-to-nation-relationship-with-first-nations.html\">nation-to-nation</a>\u201d relationship with First Nations, he must devote resources to aboriginal communities like Attawapiskat equal to the immense wealth that has been mined from their lands and has subsidized Canada for decades. In turn, First Nations governments must use these resources to build basic infrastructure and strengthen languages and cultures devastated by residential schools. Research among First Nations in British Columbia has linked <a href=\"http://web.uvic.ca/%7Elalonde/manuscripts/2004Transformations.pdf\">lower suicide rates</a> to cultural continuity and strength in indigenous communities.</p> <p>In the depths of a crisis faced by the people of the parting rocks but shared by First Nations across Canada, we will see the true depth of Canada\u2019s commitment to truth and reconciliation.</p> <p><em>\u2022 In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is <a href=\"tel:1-800-273-8255\">1-800-273-8255</a>.

A 2012 study in the journal of Social Science &amp; Medicine demonstrated that residential schools had a grave mental health impact on survivors and their children, exposing multiple generations to abuse and trauma and putting children today at risk of suicide. At the schools, indigenous languages were beaten out of children who were taught to hate their parents, their grandparents and themselves for being Indian. In Attawapiskat, as in many First Nations communities across Canada, the despair, poverty and racism of colonialism resurge in the present. The ministers and priests of generations past were so thorough that the plutocrats of today need merely slash a budget here or there and look neglectfully away while the ugly truth of Canada\u2019s foundation reaps what it has sown. \u201cLook at them,\u201d the Conservative talking heads will say, \u201cthey\u2019re killing themselves\u201d. Despite the spate of suicides currently devastating Attawapiskat and slowly churning through aboriginal communities throughout Canada, this First Nation \u2013 like all others \u2013 will endure through the hardship. Against all odds, Canada\u2019s 634 First Nations have survived and even thrived in the face of colonization. Many members of the Attawapiskat community still speak Swampy Cree and derive their sustenance from the land, as their ancestors have for generations. Some critics will say that this wave of suicide is their communities\u2019 failing \u2013 an old and tired argument that Canada should abandon the reserve system entirely in favor of urban resettlement. But this is not about the wrongs of the Attawapiskat Nation. It is about the wrongs of another. And in Canada\u2019s moment of truth and reconciliation the worth of a nation will be measured by its ability to right this enduring wrong. We can no longer pretend that apologies and public ceremonies are a tacit support for a wholly unjust, unequal and deadly status quo. If Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is sincere in his commitment to build a \u201cnation-to-nation\u201d relationship with First Nations, he must devote resources to aboriginal communities like Attawapiskat equal to the immense wealth that has been mined from their lands and has subsidized Canada for decades. In turn, First Nations governments must use these resources to build basic infrastructure and strengthen languages and cultures devastated by residential schools. Research among First Nations in British Columbia has linked lower suicide rates to cultural continuity and strength in indigenous communities. In the depths of a crisis faced by the people of the parting rocks but shared by First Nations across Canada, we will see the true depth of Canada\u2019s commitment to truth and reconciliation. \u2022 In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is 1-800-273-8255. In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 08457 90 90 90. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14. Hotlines in other countries can be found here.",

Canada\u2019s 1.4 million indigenous people, who make up about 4% of the country\u2019s population, continue to struggle with higher levels of poverty and a lower life expectancy as compared with other Canadians. A 2010 report suggested the suicide rate for children under the age of 15 in some First Nations in northern Ontario is 50 times the Canadian average for children of that age. In March, officials from the Pimicikamak Cree Nation in northern Manitoba also declared a state of emergency after six suicides in a span of two months and 140 attempts in two weeks.

Rather it offers a chance to compare how much has changed since the last session \u2013 if not within the UN, then outside it. \u201cThe voices of reform are getting stronger,\u201d Fordham said. \u201cIt\u2019s a slow burn. They are saying, you guys can stay in your ivory towers in Vienna or New York and pretend that the world isn\u2019t changing around you, but it is.\u201d</p> <p>Daniel Wolfe, director of the international harm reduction development programme at the Open Society Foundations, agrees with Fordham\u2019s analysis. For Wolfe, the established UN consensus no longer holds. Too many countries damaged by the war are now challenging the orthodoxy.</p> <p>\u201cThe Latin Americans have done amazing things,\u201d Wolfe said. \u201cI think there is the sense that Vienna has become a kind of Jurassic Park, with the dinosaurs of drug control running around and dictating the terms of the discussion, and ignoring the voices of other countries and communities that have come a lot farther than they have.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, in the last decade many former heads of state and eminent scientists have tied their colours to the mast of the influential <a href=\"http://www.globalcommissionondrugs.org/\" title=\"\">Global Commission on Drug Policy </a>(GCDP) \u2013 and come out against maintaining the status quo.</p> <p>What is significant now, though, is that incumbent governments, both big and small, are starting to agree. Portugal decriminalised all drugs in 2001, while Switzerland has pioneered the policy of heroin prescription; the US states of Washington and Colorado have legalised the sale of marijuana for recreational purposes. In May 2014, Uruguay unveiled reforms to make it the first country in the world to legalise sales of marijuana. A year later Canada\u2019s newly elected prime minister, Justin Trudeau, announced that possession of marijuana for recreational use would be legalised.</p> <p>The same year the Mexican supreme court concluded that national laws making it illegal personally to produce, possess and consume marijuana violated the rights of Mexicans, paving the way for decriminalisation. There has also been an explosion in harm reduction initiatives at the subnational level. Drug consumption rooms and drug testing laboratories \u2013 allowing users to consume or check their narcotics without fear of prosecution \u2013 have mushroomed across cities in Canada, Spain, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland.</p> <p>Even the US, one of the most ferocious defenders of the status quo, appears to accept that the game is up. In 2014, in a little noted intervention in the drug control debate, Bill Brownfield, assistant secretary of state for the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, observed: \u201cThings have changed since 1961. We must have enough flexibility to allow us to incorporate those changes into our policies \u2026 to tolerate different national drug policies, to accept the fact that some countries will have very strict drug approaches, other countries will legalise entire categories of drugs. All these countries must work together in the international community.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"60aa732c61c81344b29200a0af67e3f046b6e7b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60aa732c61c81344b29200a0af67e3f046b6e7b0/0_128_5214_3128/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A poppy field in the state of Guerrero, Mexico.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A poppy field in the state of Guerrero, Mexico.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pedro Pardo/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Further evidence that the US may be subtly shifting its position came last week <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/29/barack-obama-drug-addiction-health-problem-not-criminal-problem\" title=\"\">as Barack Obama addressed a drug addiction conference in Atlanta</a>. \u201cFor too long we\u2019ve viewed drug addiction through the lens of criminal justice,\u201d the US president said. \u201cThe most important thing to do is reduce demand. And the only way to do that is to provide treatment \u2013 to see it as a public health problem and not a criminal problem.\u201d</p> <p>Such an acknowledgement is long overdue in the mind of Professor Michel Kazatchkine, the UN special envoy for HIV/Aids in eastern Europe and central Asia and a member of the GCDP, who was one of the first physicians in Europe to treat people with HIV/Aids.</p> <p>Kazatchkine attended the 1998 special session and observes that, since then, there has been a change in how many states discuss drugs. \u201cThere has been a shift in language,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is more importance placed on health.\u201d But only in certain countries. In others, notably Russia and several east African states where drug use is subject to zero tolerance by the authorities, drug-related deaths from HIV and hepatitis C are escalating.</p> <p>On some days Kazatchkine is optimistic that the call for reform is being heard. \u201cWhen the sun is shining outside and the sky is blue, you could indeed think that we are at the beginning of a process of significant change. When it\u2019s raining you think how is it that with all the evidence we have of the failure of drug policies and of the recognition that a world free of drugs is an impossible and unnecessary myth, that the world is not moving faster? The very notion of a world without drugs is totally useless. It serves prohibition and prohibition serves repression and repression serves abuses of human rights and negative impacts on human health.\u201d</p> <p>Some Latin American countries, frustrated by what will be perceived as lack of progress at this month\u2019s special session, may choose to issue their own minority report as a counter to the prohibitionist arguments advanced by the UN. This would help to set the agenda for 2019, when the UN must set out its next 10-year drugs strategy. By then Canada and California will have legalised cannabis markets, which experts say will make a mockery of a blanket prohibition policy \u2013 but only up to a point.</p> <p>\u201cWill cannabis reform help?\u201d asked Kasia Malinowska-Sempruch, director of the Open Society Foundations global drug policy programme. \u201cOf course, but if it\u2019s only cannabis reform then the poorest, most vulnerable, most marginalised folk will keep on suffering.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There has been a shift in language. There is more importance placed on health</p> <footer> <cite>Professor Michel Kazatchkine, UN special envoy</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>By 2019 the UN will have a new secretary general too. \u201cThe fact that the outgoing secretary general comes from Asia, a region with the most draconian policies, probably didn\u2019t work to our advantage,\u201d Malinowska-Sempruch said. \u201cWhoever comes next will have to take this on in a very significant way.\u201d</p> <p>A game-changer would be if the leader of a developed country came out firmly against prohibition, something that would turbocharge the drive for reform. But this looks unlikely. Even the most candid and unabashed of politicians, Donald Trump, who in the 1990s firmly supported legalisation, has changed his mind now that he is marching on the White House.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Wolfe believes the world is approaching a tipping point. \u201cTo a certain extent the most promising reforms will be from outside Geneva or the headquarters of the UN. They will come from communities saying we can\u2019t afford to wait for bureaucratic processes and old thinking to catch up. You get paradigm shifts when the contradictions accumulate so much that it is clear the existing system or pattern of thought is no longer adequate to capture the reality, and we may be approaching one of those times with drugs.\u201d</p> <p>Malinowska-Sempruch draws a comparison with the Aids crisis. \u201cThere were awful times when people were dying and there was no medicine. Within a span of 10 years we moved to a situation where retrovirals were available. There wasn\u2019t a switch that went on for people. There was a process of outrage and an articulation of fairness that focused on the difference between how life is considered in the global north and how it is considered in the global south and how awful that discrepancy is. That was what got people to move.\u201d</p> <p>The pledge that will be made at this year\u2019s special session is for a society free of drug abuse by 2019. This is an advance on the previous session\u2019s promise to make the world drug-free by 2008. A semantic tweak perhaps but one that speaks volumes, Malinowska-Sempruch believes. \u201cIt\u2019s a subtle shift, but I think it\u2019s a significant one.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c47240f5ba2c19640b8df54e3490a5550d7251a0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c47240f5ba2c19640b8df54e3490a5550d7251a0/589_0_1944_2431/800.jpg\" alt=\"Sir Richard Branson.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sir Richard Branson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Call for reforms</h2> <p>The United Nations general assembly special session (UNgass) on drugs was due to be held in 2018 - two decades on from the last session. But it has been brought forward following calls in 2012 from Mexico, Colombia and Guatemala for urgent reform of global drug control policy. These are three countries that have felt at close hand the consequences of the war on drugs and have been vociferous in calling on the world to move beyond blanket prohibition.</p> <p>Despite pleas for reform, the UN has been resolute in its support for the status quo, ignoring the seismic social, cultural and juridical shifts that have taken place since the last session - and the fact that prohibition has been exposed as a failure.</p> <p>In its submission to the special session, Colombia quotes Albert Einstein\u2019s aphorism that the definition of insanity is \u201cdoing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result\u201d. And yet this is the approach favoured by the UN Office on Drugs and Crime and its Commission on Narcotic Drugs, which have been unbending in their defence of the policy.</p> <p>Sir Richard Branson, a Global Commission on Drugs Policy commissioner, argues that the true importance of special session lies in affording countries and civil society groups a chance to make their voices heard. This, in turn, will create momentum.</p> <p>\u201cThe key now is to understand the long-term trajectory. UNgass is a milestone, but it isn\u2019t the last opportunity for change. The next couple of years will see more countries begin to experiment and enter new territory.</p> <p>\u201cWhat also matters about UNgass are signals and gestures. Already, some governments are preparing powerful statements. So, as the world\u2019s attention turns to New York for a brief moment, let\u2019s make this session a strong show of dissent. That may actually be more impactful than the outcome document itself.\u201d</p>",

Lehman Brothers collapsed, Radovan Karad\u017ei\u0107 was arrested, Russian troops massed on the Georgian border, and Barack Obama beat John McCain to the White House. But 2008 was also significant for something that didn\u2019t happen. It was the year that the world didn\u2019t eliminate the illicit drugs problem. This quixotic goal had been set a decade earlier at a United Nations general assembly special session when, under the vainglorious slogan \u201cWe can do it\u201d, the supranational body pledged that, by 2008, the world would be \u201cdrug free\u201d. Now, as the UN prepares to host another special session on drugs in New York this month, the failure of the 1998 assembly to realise the goal is recorded in the vast amounts of money, resources, time and blood that have been expended in pursuing the apparently impossible. As Ending the War on Drugs, a new book of essays from some of the leading critics of drugs laws, spells out in chilling detail, pursuing such an ambition has cost taxpayers around the world $100bn (\u00a370.5bn) a year, roughly the same amount spent on foreign aid. The main beneficiaries of the laws \u2013 framed around the 1961 UN single convention on narcotic drugs, which prohibits the production and supply of a number of named substances \u2013 are criminal organisations, which have gained control of a global market with a turnover of more than $320bn a year. Meanwhile, millions of people have been criminalised for non-violent drug offences, leading to more than 1.4 million arrests in the US in 2014 alone. In countries such as Iran and Saudi Arabia, executions for drug trafficking have soared. The death toll has reached nightmare proportions. In Mexico, 30 people a day are dying in the battle between drug cartels and government forces. And these are just the obvious deaths. Last month a commission set up by the Lancet medical journal and Johns Hopkins University declared that the drugs laws had not only failed to curb drug use and fuelled violent crime, they had also helped to spread HIV and hepatitis C by encouraging unsafe injecting. By any yardstick, the 1961 convention has been a spectacular failure, one that has had devastating consequences for those caught in the crosshairs of the war on drugs \u2013 a war, critics say, that is of the UN\u2019s making. \u201cGiven that the UN was set up to maintain security, it seems more than an oddity that it is running a war out of its own offices,\u201d said Danny Kushlick of the pro-reform campaign group Transform.

Its own analysis notes: \u201cGlobal drug control efforts have had a dramatic unintended consequence: a criminal black market of staggering proportions. Organised crime is a threat to security.

The very notion of a world without drugs is totally useless. It serves prohibition and prohibition serves repression and repression serves abuses of human rights and negative impacts on human health.\u201d Some Latin American countries, frustrated by what will be perceived as lack of progress at this month\u2019s special session, may choose to issue their own minority report as a counter to the prohibitionist arguments advanced by the UN. This would help to set the agenda for 2019, when the UN must set out its next 10-year drugs strategy. By then Canada and California will have legalised cannabis markets, which experts say will make a mockery of a blanket prohibition policy \u2013 but only up to a point. \u201cWill cannabis reform help?\u201d asked Kasia Malinowska-Sempruch, director of the Open Society Foundations global drug policy programme. \u201cOf course, but if it\u2019s only cannabis reform then the poorest, most vulnerable, most marginalised folk will keep on suffering.\u201d By 2019 the UN will have a new secretary general too. \u201cThe fact that the outgoing secretary general comes from Asia, a region with the most draconian policies, probably didn\u2019t work to our advantage,\u201d Malinowska-Sempruch said. \u201cWhoever comes next will have to take this on in a very significant way.\u201d A game-changer would be if the leader of a developed country came out firmly against prohibition, something that would turbocharge the drive for reform. But this looks unlikely. Even the most candid and unabashed of politicians, Donald Trump, who in the 1990s firmly supported legalisation, has changed his mind now that he is marching on the White House. Nevertheless, Wolfe believes the world is approaching a tipping point. \u201cTo a certain extent the most promising reforms will be from outside Geneva or the headquarters of the UN. They will come from communities saying we can\u2019t afford to wait for bureaucratic processes and old thinking to catch up. You get paradigm shifts when the contradictions accumulate so much that it is clear the existing system or pattern of thought is no longer adequate to capture the reality, and we may be approaching one of those times with drugs.\u201d Malinowska-Sempruch draws a comparison with the Aids crisis. \u201cThere were awful times when people were dying and there was no medicine. Within a span of 10 years we moved to a situation where retrovirals were available. There wasn\u2019t a switch that went on for people. There was a process of outrage and an articulation of fairness that focused on the difference between how life is considered in the global north and how it is considered in the global south and how awful that discrepancy is. That was what got people to move.\u201d The pledge that will be made at this year\u2019s special session is for a society free of drug abuse by 2019. This is an advance on the previous session\u2019s promise to make the world drug-free by 2008. A semantic tweak perhaps but one that speaks volumes, Malinowska-Sempruch believes. \u201cIt\u2019s a subtle shift, but I think it\u2019s a significant one.\u201d Call for reforms The United Nations general assembly special session (UNgass) on drugs was due to be held in 2018 - two decades on from the last session. But it has been brought forward following calls in 2012 from Mexico, Colombia and Guatemala for urgent reform of global drug control policy. These are three countries that have felt at close hand the consequences of the war on drugs and have been vociferous in calling on the world to move beyond blanket prohibition. Despite pleas for reform, the UN has been resolute in its support for the status quo, ignoring the seismic social, cultural and juridical shifts that have taken place since the last session - and the fact that prohibition has been exposed as a failure. In its submission to the special session, Colombia quotes Albert Einstein\u2019s aphorism that the definition of insanity is \u201cdoing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result\u201d. And yet this is the approach favoured by the UN Office on Drugs and Crime and its Commission on Narcotic Drugs, which have been unbending in their defence of the policy. Sir Richard Branson, a Global Commission on Drugs Policy commissioner, argues that the true importance of special session lies in affording countries and civil society groups a chance to make their voices heard. This, in turn, will create momentum. \u201cThe key now is to understand the long-term trajectory. UNgass is a milestone, but it isn\u2019t the last opportunity for change. The next couple of years will see more countries begin to experiment and enter new territory. \u201cWhat also matters about UNgass are signals and gestures. Already, some governments are preparing powerful statements. So, as the world\u2019s attention turns to New York for a brief moment, let\u2019s make this session a strong show of dissent. That may actually be more impactful than the outcome document itself.\u201d",

          "body": "<p>The blazing lights of the boxing ring flashed that night in 2012 in Ottawa, Canada, for the \u201cThrilla on the Hilla\u201d. The beat was heavy, the announcer\u2019s voice loud. In the blue corner was Patrick \u201cBrass Knuckles\u201d Brazeau, a hulking, tattooed, beast of a man, a Canadian navy veteran with a black belt in karate, at 37 the youngest senator by a matter of decades and four years younger than his opponent.</p> <p>Facing him in the red corner was the then MP for Papineau, one of the smallest electoral district Canada. Regarded by pundits as a national lightweight \u2013 a lanky, comparatively slight, pampered pretty-boy, widely seen as insubstantial, a long-haired fop, who people felt rode the coat-tails of his famous prime minister father to a seat in Canada\u2019s House of Commons.</p> <p>His name was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/justin-trudeau\">Justin Trudeau</a>.</p> <p>To call the match sensational would be to understate the situation. It may have been for charity, but to think of it as just for fun would be to miss the vast and dramatic symbolism of the event. In Ottawa, it was a sensation.</p> <p>The boxing match that marked the beginning of his meteoric rise to Canada\u2019s highest office is revisited in a new film currently awaiting theatrical release called <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/144537690\">God Save Justin Trudeau</a>. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"film\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/120332258&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/120332258&quot;&gt;GOD SAVE JUSTIN TRUDEAU or How the MP for Papineau became Prime Minister of Canada&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/productionsdelaruelle&quot;&gt;Productions de la Ruelle&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com&quot;&gt;Vimeo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The film-makers, Eric Ruel and Guylaine Maroist, were given unparalleled access and behind-the-scenes footage reveals that the participants \u2013 and even then prime minister Stephen Harper \u2013 were all too aware of the symbolic importance of the match. The Liberal party had been routed. The Conservatives were a political behemoth, having cast the Liberals into the wilderness.</p> <p>\u201cLeaderless and penniless, the Liberals have been given up for dead,\u201d the film opens. \u201cOne man will change the course of history.\u201d</p> <p>Ruel and Maroist were extremely busy finishing two other films when they heard about the Trudeau-Brazeau match, they told the Guardian. But they immediately recognised it for what it was. \u201cI thought this was an amazing image,\u201d Maroist told the Guardian. \u201cAn amazing metaphor for political life.\u201d</p> <p>The film is subtitled \u201cor how the member of parliament for Papineau became prime minister of Canada\u201d, and the thesis is clear: that this match was Trudeau\u2019s gambit, that he knew what he was doing, despite the scorn from pundits who thought he would be crushed by Brazeau. The subtext is that, viewed from the perspective of his fight, Trudeau\u2019s spectacular <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/20/justin-trudeau-set-to-become-pm-as-liberals-sweep-board-in-canada-election\">victory</a> in October was exquisitely planned this way from the start.</p> <p>Asked on film why he\u2019s doing the fight, Trudeau gives a telling answer: \u201cNever underestimate the power of symbols in today\u2019s world \u2026 the Liberal party is in a weak position in parliament. We\u2019ve never had so few MPs. The Conservatives have all the money and the support. So \u2026 wouldn\u2019t it be fun to see Justin Trudeau win? A triumph over the all-powerful Conservatives?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was put on this planet to do this,\u201d Trudeau is shown telling supporters at the gala before the fight. \u201cI fight \u2013 and I win.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey all said Trudeau will never go anywhere, he\u2019s a lightweight, he will never even be the Liberal leader,\u201d Ruel told the Guardian. \u201cEven two months before the leadership race was over, the broadcasters were still saying the same thing to us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPeople were belittling him. People were calling him the Paris Hilton of Canadian politics,\u201d Maroist said. But Trudeau told them, she continued, that if he could put in people\u2019s minds that he could beat the Conservatives, that might change the public\u2019s idea of him. \u201cBecause you have to understand,\u201d she added, \u201cbeing the son of [former prime minister Pierre Trudeau], being establishment, being a very good looking young man, was also something not positive for a politician. I think people underestimated him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut we knew, being very close to the two pugilists, that Mr Trudeau was very focused on winning,\u201d Ruel added. Brazeau, by contrast, was overconfident, and seemed uninterested in strategy.</p> <p>The match itself, which is played in full in the film, is nothing short of stark. Brazeau comes out swinging, but Trudeau absorbs his every punch, ducking and jumping back. He is light on his feet.</p> <p>But the bigger senator, by contrast, lumbers around, always chasing, never properly managing to connect a punch. By the third round, he is exhausted, sweat pouring off him. Then Trudeau begins to punish him, pouring punch after punch until the referee steps in.</p> <p>At no point does Justin Trudeau seem in even the slightest bit out of control. The visual effect of the metaphor is, by this point, inescapable \u2013 his victory, when it comes, is inevitable.</p> <p>After the fight, Trudeau\u2019s rise was meteoric. And, though his party was behind in the polls for much of the election campaign, in hindsight once again it seems as if he was never out of control there, either \u2013 while Harper lumbered around with last-minute appeals to Rob Ford supporters.</p> <p>As for Brazeau, after being humiliated by Trudeau his fall was almost as dramatic as his opponent\u2019s rocket-like ascent. He was abandoned by Harper\u2019s government, and arrested in 2013 on charges of sexual assault and domestic abuse. He was suspended from the senate and briefly managed an Ottawa strip club. </p> <p>The film, which is awaiting theatrical distribution, is available now on <a href=\"http:// https://vimeo.com/111824057\">Vimeo</a>.</p>",

It may have been for charity, but to think of it as just for fun would be to miss the vast and dramatic symbolism of the event. In Ottawa, it was a sensation. The boxing match that marked the beginning of his meteoric rise to Canada\u2019s highest office is revisited in a new film currently awaiting theatrical release called God Save Justin Trudeau. The film-makers, Eric Ruel and Guylaine Maroist, were given unparalleled access and behind-the-scenes footage reveals that the participants \u2013 and even then prime minister Stephen Harper \u2013 were all too aware of the symbolic importance of the match. The Liberal party had been routed. The Conservatives were a political behemoth, having cast the Liberals into the wilderness. \u201cLeaderless and penniless, the Liberals have been given up for dead,\u201d the film opens. \u201cOne man will change the course of history.\u201d Ruel and Maroist were extremely busy finishing two other films when they heard about the Trudeau-Brazeau match, they told the Guardian. But they immediately recognised it for what it was. \u201cI thought this was an amazing image,\u201d Maroist told the Guardian. \u201cAn amazing metaphor for political life.\u201d The film is subtitled \u201cor how the member of parliament for Papineau became prime minister of Canada\u201d, and the thesis is clear: that this match was Trudeau\u2019s gambit, that he knew what he was doing, despite the scorn from pundits who thought he would be crushed by Brazeau. The subtext is that, viewed from the perspective of his fight, Trudeau\u2019s spectacular victory in October was exquisitely planned this way from the start. Asked on film why he\u2019s doing the fight, Trudeau gives a telling answer: \u201cNever underestimate the power of symbols in today\u2019s world \u2026 the Liberal party is in a weak position in parliament. We\u2019ve never had so few MPs. The Conservatives have all the money and the support. So \u2026 wouldn\u2019t it be fun to see Justin Trudeau win? A triumph over the all-powerful Conservatives?\u201d \u201cI was put on this planet to do this,\u201d Trudeau is shown telling supporters at the gala before the fight. \u201cI fight \u2013 and I win.\u201d \u201cThey all said Trudeau will never go anywhere, he\u2019s a lightweight, he will never even be the Liberal leader,\u201d Ruel told the Guardian. \u201cEven two months before the leadership race was over, the broadcasters were still saying the same thing to us.\u201d \u201cPeople were belittling him. People were calling him the Paris Hilton of Canadian politics,\u201d Maroist said. But Trudeau told them, she continued, that if he could put in people\u2019s minds that he could beat the Conservatives, that might change the public\u2019s idea of him. \u201cBecause you have to understand,\u201d she added, \u201cbeing the son of [former prime minister Pierre Trudeau], being establishment, being a very good looking young man, was also something not positive for a politician. I think people underestimated him.\u201d \u201cBut we knew, being very close to the two pugilists, that Mr Trudeau was very focused on winning,\u201d Ruel added. Brazeau, by contrast, was overconfident, and seemed uninterested in strategy. The match itself, which is played in full in the film, is nothing short of stark. Brazeau comes out swinging, but Trudeau absorbs his every punch, ducking and jumping back. He is light on his feet. But the bigger senator, by contrast, lumbers around, always chasing, never properly managing to connect a punch. By the third round, he is exhausted, sweat pouring off him. Then Trudeau begins to punish him, pouring punch after punch until the referee steps in. At no point does Justin Trudeau seem in even the slightest bit out of control. The visual effect of the metaphor is, by this point, inescapable \u2013 his victory, when it comes, is inevitable. After the fight, Trudeau\u2019s rise was meteoric. And, though his party was behind in the polls for much of the election campaign, in hindsight once again it seems as if he was never out of control there, either \u2013 while Harper lumbered around with last-minute appeals to Rob Ford supporters. As for Brazeau, after being humiliated by Trudeau his fall was almost as dramatic as his opponent\u2019s rocket-like ascent. He was abandoned by Harper\u2019s government, and arrested in 2013 on charges of sexual assault and domestic abuse. He was suspended from the senate and briefly managed an Ottawa strip club. The film, which is awaiting theatrical distribution, is available now on Vimeo.",

The letter reads in part:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cYou [Trump] hold interests as the sole or principal owner in approximately 500 separate entities. These entities are collectively referred to and do business as The Trump Organization. These entities engage in hundreds of transactions, deals, and new enterprises every year. Because you operate these businesses almost exclusively through sole proprietorships and/or closely held partnerships, your personal federal income tax returns are inordinately large and complex for an individual.</p> <p>\u201cYour personal tax returns have been under continuous examination by the Internal Revenue Service since 2002, consistent with the IRS\u2019s practice for large and complex businesses. Examination of your tax returns for the years 2002 through 2008 have been closed administratively by agreement with the IRS without assessment or payment, on a net basis, of any deficiency. </p> <p>\u201cExaminations for returns for the 2009 year and forward are ongoing. Your returns for these years report items that are attributable to continuing transactions or activities that were also reported on returns for 2008 and earlier. In this sense, the pending examinations are continuations of prior, closed examinations.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Translation: Trump is being audited, and he won\u2019t release the older tax returns because they\u2019re related to business that\u2019s being audited in the newer tax returns. But he could, legally, release any of them at any point.

More prosaically, they could simply reveal that Trump is not worth the \u201cTEN BILLION DOLLARS\u201d [sic] that he told campaign finance officials he is worth.</p> <p>There are cracks in his claims to be worth billions, including at a golf course in upstate New York.

Donald Trump released a letter from his tax lawyers, who say he hasn\u2019t released his federal tax returns \u2013 and in the process revealed what he\u2019s really worth \u2013 because of a 14-year continuous audit by the IRS. Trump\u2019s tax returns are \u201cinordinately large and complex for an individual\u201d Translation: Trump is being audited, and he won\u2019t release the older tax returns because they\u2019re related to business that\u2019s being audited in the newer tax returns. But he could legally release any of them if he wanted. You can read the full letter here. Trump\u2019s threat to not support his party\u2019s eventual nominee may end up costing him as many as 50 delegates in his race to clinch the Republican nomination. South Carolina required all candidates on its primary ballot to sign a pledge declaring their loyalty to the eventual winner of the Republican presidential nomination as a precondition for being placed on the ballot. Trump, of course, has reneged on that pledge. Party chair Reince Priebus held a meeting with the billionaire frontrunner today, which lasted approximately 50 minutes and touched on the subject of... nobody knows. But we have a few good guesses that it had something to do with declaring that women who have abortions should be legally punished in some way. At a rally in upstate New York today, former secretary of state and Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton lost her patience with an activist for Greenpeace who asked her whether she will reject money from the petroleum industry in the future, declaring that she was \u201ctired of the Sanders campaign\u2019s lies.\u201d Sanders hit back with a fundraising email that highlighted her relationships with numerous members of the fossil fuel industry. Trump continued damage-control operations late into the night. \u201cIf you answer one question inartfully or incorrectly in some form, or you misunderstood it or you misspoke, it ends up being a big story,\u201d Trump told the New York Times. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t happen with other people.\u201d That\u2019s it for today - we\u2019ll catch you tomorrow, the next day and every day until Election Day! The executive director of the US Election Assistance Commission, the federal agency tasked with widening access to voting, used his position to help push legal obstacles to voter registration in three states, according to the Associated Press. Brian Newby, the official in question, used his position to unilaterally declare that residents of Alabama, Georgia and Kansas could no longer register to vote by using a national form without providing proof of American citizenship. According to the Associated Press, Newby did so with the knowledge of Kansas\u2019 Republican secretary of state Kris Kobach, whom Newby emailed in June to say that \u201cI think I would enter the job empowered to lead the way I want to.\u201d Kobach has been a fervent proponent of voter ID laws, which he says curb voter fraud. Critics have alleged that purported concern about voter fraud - the existence of which is hotly disputed - is in fact a cover to curb voter registration among economic and racial demographics who tend to vote Democratic. Do you have what it takes to betray the Colonies? ClickHole, for the win. California lawmakers have approved the nation\u2019s highest statewide minimum wage of $15 an hour, to take effect by 2022 after it was hailed by Democrats as an example to the nation as it struggles with a growing gap between rich and poor. The legislation now goes to Governor Jerry Brown, who is expected to sign it into law after previously working out the plan with labor unions. The state of New York was considering a similar move. About 2.2 million Californians now earn the minimum wage. The University of California, Berkeley\u2019s Center for Labor Research and Education projected the increase would have a ripple effect for those whose wages would increase to keep pace. The researchers project it would increase pay for 5.6 million Californians by an average of 24%. More than a third of the affected workers are parents. Latinos would benefit most because they hold a disproportionate number of low-wage jobs, the researchers said. Billionaire Republican frontrunner Donald Trump continued damage-control operations after the candidate declared on Wednesday that women who had abortions would be legally punished if the procedure became illegal. \u201cIf you answer one question inartfully or incorrectly in some form, or you misunderstood it or you misspoke, it ends up being a big story,\u201d Trump told the New York Times. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t happen with other people.\u201d Trump\u2019s campaign issued a statement backtracking on his comments within three hours, but the outcry from both the left and the right has dominated the news cycle, with Trump apparently being summoned to a closed-door meeting with Republican National Committee chair Reince Priebus this afternoon. While acknowledging that he \u201cmisspoke\u201d on the issue of criminalizing abortion, Trump told the New York Times that he was being subjected to undue scrutiny. \u201cI\u2019m asked hundreds of questions a day,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou multiply that by months and months and months, and every once in awhile, if you misspeak - I was very focused on the topic of the Catholic Church.\u201d \u201cThe difference is that if I say something that\u2019s off, if I say something that\u2019s off one way or another, it gets massive publicity,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cIf somebody else does it, nobody cares.\u201d Anyone who has lived in the nation\u2019s capital knows that Washington, DC, is a tight-knit community, but a connection between Barack Obama\u2019s supreme court nominee and Donald Trump\u2019s campaign manager? That\u2019s odd even for Washington. As it turns out, Merrick Garland, the federal appeals court judge currently up for consideration to fill the vacant seat on the supreme court, was once one of three judges who stymied efforts by Corey Lewandowski, Trump\u2019s campaign manager, to get his gun back after he was arrested for bringing it into an office building on Capitol Hill. According to USA Today, Lewandowski - who has been charged with battery for allegedly assaulting a campaign reporter at a Trump event in Florida - fought legal battles for four years in an effort to get the gun returned to him. An appeal of his federal lawsuit in hopes of receiving his gun and payment for mental anguish landed in Garland\u2019s court in 2003, where a panel composed of Garland and two conservative judges denied Lewandowski\u2019s claim. Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign spokesman Michael Briggs has issued a statement after Hillary Clinton declared on video that she was \u201csick of the Sanders\u2019 campaign lying about\u201d fossil-fuel industry donations to her campaign. \u201cThe truth is that Secretary Clinton has relied heavily on funds from lobbyists working for the oil, gas and coal industry,\u201d Briggs said. \u201cAccording to an analysis by Greenpeace, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign and her super-PAC have received more than $4.5 million from the fossil fuel industry. In fact, 57 oil, gas and coal industry lobbyists have directly contributed to Clinton\u2019s campaign, with 43 of them contributing the maximum allowed for the primary. Eleven of those 53 lobbyists are working as bundlers and have raised over $1.1 million in bundled contributions between them.\u201d \u201cIf Secretary Clinton wants to discuss this and other important issues she should stop stalling and agree to a debate in New York before the April 19 primary election,\u201d Briggs said. An incredibly creepy new advertisement aired on behalf of John Kasich\u2019s struggling presidential campaign takes Donald Trump\u2019s nickname for Texas senator Ted Cruz to an extremely uncomfortable level. \u201cMany just call him Lyin\u2019 Ted,\u201d the ad begins, using Trump\u2019s nickname for Cruz, saying that he \u201clied about Ben Carson to steal a win in Iowa.\u201d The ad goes on to list several other ostensible untruths as Cruz\u2019s nose winds its way around his head, a la Pinocchio. Cruz, the ad says, \u201clies about being best for the GOP when polls show he can\u2019t even beat Hillary Clinton.\u201d \u201cIf Ted Cruz\u2019s mouth is moving, he\u2019s lying,\u201d the ad finishes. Susan Sarandon and Debra Messing have declared their Twitter feud over after the two actors got into a public spat over their support for Bernie Sanders andHillary Clinton in the Democratic presidential race. The feud began when Sarandon implied that she would vote for Republican frontrunner Donald Trump if Sanders, her preferred Democratic candidate, lost the nomination to Clinton. \u201cI think a lot of people are like, \u2018Sorry, I just can\u2019t bring myself to vote for [Clinton],\u2019\u201d Sarandon said during an appearance MSNBC\u2019s All In with Chris Hayeson Monday. \u201cSome people feel Donald Trump will bring the revolution immediately.\u201d While Sarandon later clarified that she would never vote for Trump, her comments drew immediate fury \u2013 not least from Messing, a prominent Clinton supporter, who asked the Thelma and Louise star why she would not use her large platform to make clear that she would not vote for Trump. Sarandon defended herself, saying she was thinking more about first-time voters who might have a \u201cdilemma\u201d in voting for someone who they had not originally supported. Republicans holding out hope that Mitt Romney or Paul Ryan might arrive as white knights at the Republican convention in Cleveland this summer might want to reconsider their options, if a new poll is any indication. The newest national poll conducted by Public Policy Polling finds that onetime ticket-mates Romney and Ryan wouldn\u2019t neautralize the Republican party\u2019s forthcoming general election crisis. Romney, in fact, would perform even worse against Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton than Trump. Romney, once the Republican presidential nominee, has a favorability rating even more underwater than Trump\u2019s: 65% of Americans view him negatively, compared to a mere 23% who view him favorably. (Trump, by comparison, is viewed negatively by 63% of Americans polled.) Both Clinton and Vermont senator Bernie Sanders lead Romney by double digits in a hypothetical faceoff, with Clinton taking 45% of voters to Romney\u2019s 32%. The newly minted speaker of the house would perform almost as poorly. Ryan\u2019s hypothetical run against Clinton has him down six points, while he trails Sanders by seven points. \u201cDonald Trump doesn\u2019t do very well against Hillary Clinton,\u201d Dean Debnam, president of Public Policy Polling, said in a released statement. \u201cBut it\u2019s not clear the white knights the GOP dreams of would do any better.\u201d A teenager who was pepper sprayed in the face at a rally for Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump may face a disorderly conduct charge after she allegedly punched a man in the face, according to the Associated Press. Police in Janesville, Wisconsin, are recommending that charges be brought against the juvenile, who alleges that she punched the man after he touched her in a sexual manner. The man in question told police that he does not want to press charges. Police chief David Moore told reporters that the charges would be for her punch, which was \u201can act of violence.\u201d \u201cClearly her punch was illegal,\u201d he said. Moore said that Janesville police have not identified the person who pepper sprayed the girl, but said that the person could face battery charges for the act. Retired senior military officers and human rights advocates are reacting with disgust at Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump\u2019s description of the Geneva conventions as a \u201cproblem\u201d for the conduct of US wars, writes the Guardian\u2019s Spencer Ackerman. At an appearance in Wisconsin on Wednesday that was obscured by his suggestion that women who choose abortion should face punishment, Donald Trump was also quoted as saying: \u201cThe problem is we have the Geneva conventions, all sorts of rules and regulations, so the soldiers are afraid to fight.\u201d Trump has previously advocated killing the families of terror suspects; torture \u201ca hell of a lot worse\u201d than waterboarding; and widespread bombing campaigns against Islamic State, which operates in civilian-packed areas. The Geneva conventions provide the basis for protections against war crimes, privileging the status of civilians and detainees during wartime. Several retired officers said the comments called into question Trump\u2019s fitness to serve as commander-in-chief, saying that service members operating in line with his predilections would be tasked with behavior ranging from the disgraceful to the illegal. \u201cDonald Trump cannot possibly understand [Geneva] because he has neither the experience, the expertise or the moral compass to grasp it,\u201d said Steve Kleinman, an air force reserve colonel and an interrogations expert. Geneva is \u201ca fundamental moral and tactical construct that serves as a foundation for the law of armed conflict, because all wars, including the global war on terror, come to an end. We as a community of nations need to engage with one another and not be separated by horrible, immoral treatment of one side over another,\u201d Kleinman said. At a rally in upstate New York today, former secretary of state and Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton lost her patience with an activist for Greenpeace who asked her whether she will reject money from the petroleum industry in the future. Pointing her finger at the activist, Clinton said that she only takes money from employees of companies involved in the fossil-fuel industry, and called the accusations from opponent Bernie Sanders\u2019 camp \u201clies.\u201d A succession of disturbing attacks on women have raised fresh questions about Donald Trump\u2019s credibility as a presidential candidate and are an ugly reminder of his long-standing deeply questionable attitudes, writes the Guardian\u2019s Jon Swaine. In the space of a single week he has insulted an opponent\u2019s wife\u2019s looks, defended an aide for manhandling a female reporter and said women should be punished for having abortions. But his persistent attacks on women, which have caused widespread outrage, and have heightened alarm about him within the Republican party have not come from nowhere. From flippant offensive comments about women to serious allegations of assault from those he has encountered through his relationships and career, Trump stands accused of misogyny to a degree that has not been seen in mainstream American politics for decades. Hillary Clinton could easily win not just the battle for the Democratic nomination but also the race for presidency, according to an article today by the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics. Larry J. Sabato, the Director of the center who co-authored the piece, estimates that Clinton will win 347 electoral votes while Trump would take a total of just 191. A race between Cruz and Clinton would probably be closer, but the authors still expect Clinton to come out on top (though they don\u2019t quantify by how much). The article forecasts the results by controlling for many factors which may change. As the authors explain \u201cwe don\u2019t know the shape of the economy or terrorism, or the precise job approval rating of President Obama in the autumn, or the gaffes and scandals that may yet unfold on our way to the ballot box.\u201d The subtitle of the post reads \u201cit\u2019s a long way to November\u201d. That caution from the present about the future is the most important caveat when reading analyses like this one. Americans have the right to change their minds, and many will. Donald Trump thanked Wisconsin for putting him in second place out of three candidates on Twitter today. The Republican National Committee is keeping tight-lipped about Reince Priebus\u2019 meeting with Donald Trump: The Chairman and Mr. Trump had a productive conversation about the state of the race. The Chairman is in constant communication with all of the candidates and their campaigns about the primaries, general election and the convention. Meeting and phone conversations with candidates and their campaigns are common and will increase as we get closer to November. Billionaire Republican frontrunner Donald Trump\u2019s threat to not support his party\u2019s eventual nominee may end up costing him as many as 50 delegates in his race to clinch the Republican nomination. South Carolina required all candidates on its primary ballot to sign a pledge declaring their loyalty to the eventual winner of the Republican presidential nomination as a precondition for being placed on the ballot. After deliberating, Trump signed the pledge in a much-hyped public event at Trump Tower in midtown Manhattan. \u201cI will be totally pledging my allegiance to the Republican Party and the conservative principles for which it stands and we will go out and fight hard and we will win... I have no intention of changing my mind,\u201d the billionaire said at the time. \u201cI see no circumstances under which I would tear up that pledge.\u201d But during a town hall in Milwaukee with CNN on Tuesday night, Trump revoked the commitment and declared that he had been \u201ctreated very unfairly\u201d by the party and his opponents. \u201cBreaking South Carolina\u2019s presidential primary ballot pledge raises some unanswered legal questions that no one person can answer,\u201d South Carolina Republican chair Matt Moore told TIME. \u201cHowever, a court or national convention Committee on Contests could resolve them. It could put delegates in jeopardy.\u201d Although Moore has backtracked - however slightly: Following a ballot-certification snafu that may have accidentally kept Vermont senator Bernie Sanders\u2019 name from being placed on the Democratic primary ballot in the upcoming Washington, DC, primary, a member of the federal district\u2019s city council is preparing to submit emergency legislation to ensure that both Sanders and opponent Hillary Clinton will make it on the Democratic party\u2019s ballot. According to NBC\u2019s Washington affiliate, DC city council member Anita Bonds, who also chairs the DC Democratic party, will put the legislation up for a vote as soon as this coming Tuesday. Both Sanders and Clinton submitted the necessary paperwork to the local Democratic party before the March 16 filing deadline, but the party did not forward either candidate\u2019s name to the DC board of elections until the next day. A voter filed a challenge to Sanders\u2019 registration, igniting the issue. No such challenge has been filed against the Clinton campaign. Along with some world leaders, the US\u2019s neighbors to the north have been watching the American elections with alarm, my colleague Ashifa Kassam reports from Toronto. The leader of Canada\u2019s progressive party has labeled Donald Trump \u201ca fascist\u201d, and faulted prime minister Justin Trudeau for not condemning the Republican. \u201cDonald Trump is a fascist,\u201d Tom Mulcair said at an event last week. \u201cLet\u2019s not kid ourselves, let\u2019s not beat around the bush.\u201d He pointed to Trump\u2019s proposals to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the country and build a wall along the Mexican border as examples of how the leader was appealing to what he called \u201cthe lowest feelings in human nature\u201d. The remarks surfaced this week after the NDP sent a videoclip to media. Mulcair also attacked Trudeau\u2019s reticence to speak frankly about Trump. \u201cI will not hesitate to point out the fact that Mr Trudeau just shrugs his shoulders when he\u2019s asked about Donald Trump and says, \u2018Oh the relationship between Canada and the United States goes beyond any two individuals,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, if a fascist becomes president of the United States, I want to be on record as having opposed it long before that election.\u201d Trudeau, dubbed the anti-Trump by some in the US media, has shied away from offering his views on the possibility of Trump at the helm of Canada\u2019s largest trading partner in recent months. \u201cI\u2019m not going to pick a fight with Donald Trump right now. I\u2019m not going to support him either, obviously,\u201d he said at a forum in early March. Trudeau\u2019s hesitation was later probed in an interview with the CBC. \u201cI respect the American electoral process,\u201d he demurred. \u201cI have faith in what [Abraham] Lincoln referred to as \u2018the better angels of American nature\u2019, and I am looking forward to who I am going to work with after 4 November.\u201d Many have cautioned Trudeau to stay quiet. \u201cTrudeau, as prime minister, should refrain from commenting on candidates in US presidential elections,\u201d said Derek Burney, a former Canadian ambassador to the United States. \u201cHe will deal with whomever the electorate chooses.\u201d The question of how to engage with Trump is one leaders around the world are wrestling with, said said Brett Bruen, a former director of global engagement at the White House. He suggested actions rather than direct confrontation, such as Trudeau\u2019s greeting of Syrian refugees at the airport, as an example. \u201cThat sends a very clear message but does not entangle him in a very dirty campaign in the US,\u201d said Bruen. You can read Ashifa\u2019s full piece here, and watch Mulcair\u2019s remarks below. Only his second tweet of the day. Trump has left the Republican National Committee headquarters without making a statement to the press \u2013 even though there\u2019s at least a dozen of them hovering about. Details are sparse about Donald Trump\u2019s meetings with Republicans in Washington, but his campaign did announce a \u201cHouse Leadership Committee\u201d to \u201clead outreach\u201d for the campaign in Congress. Trump named two congressmen, Duncan Hunter and Chris Collins, to the effort. \u201cCongressman Hunter and Congressman Collins are conservative stalwarts,\u201d the businessman said in a statement. \u201cI am honored to have the support of these two well respected Members of Congress who share my vision of securing our borders, strengthening our military, treating our veterans with the respect and care they deserve and putting Americans first again.\u201d From the campaign: Mr Trump is conducting meetings today in Washington DC. Earlier in the week, he announced that his campaign will be opening a Washington DC based office to coordinate his campaign\u2019s work with the Republican National Committee, Congress, and his convention and delegate operations. Meanwhile in New York, \u201cthe Bernie people came\u201d to a rally for Hillary Clinton, in the candidate\u2019s words. Like Sanders, she\u2019s ratcheting up the civil but pointed rhetoric: \u201cAs they\u2019re leaving I want to say I have earned nine million votes in this election, already. I have one million more than Donald Trump. And I have two and a half million more votes than Bernie Sanders.\u201d Time\u2019s Zeke Miller confirms the story circulating round Washington DC \u2013 that Donald Trump is in town in part to meet with the Republican party\u2019s leaders, including chairman Reince Priebus. Earlier this week Trump reneged on his pledge to support the Republican party\u2019s nominee no matter who that ends up being. The Republican presidential candidates past continues to parade by. Now it\u2019s Kentucky senator Rand Paul, who is probably glad he helped change his state\u2019s rules ban on running for two offices at the same time. Chris Christie, the Republican governor of New Jersey, erstwhile presidential candidate, and sometime stage prop for Donald Trump, has called onto a radio show to defend the way he eats M&amp;M. The governor\u2019s decision to pour a bag of candies into a box of the same candies, photographed at a basketball game, went over so well online that Christie called a WFAN radio show, Boomer and Carton, on Wednesday morning to explain himself. \u201cThere\u2019s a bag inside the box, you dope.\u201d \u201cWhy would you go bag-to-box?\u201d the host asked. \u201cJust eat \u2018em out of the bag!\u201d Christie: \u201cYou know why? Because it\u2019s easier to hold the box than to hold the bag.\u201d The host told him \u201cthat\u2019s an interesting maneuver.\u201d His co-host clarified: \u201cit was just transferring the M&amp;Ms from a soft paper into a box?\u201d Christie: \u201cYou get the box, you open the box. There\u2019s a bag inside the box. Why they do it that way I have no idea. But you open up the bag, you pour the bag into the box, so it\u2019s easier to hold.\u201d The hosts pressed him to explain the logic of this. \u201cListen, I run New Jersey, not M&amp;M-Mars. I have no idea,\u201d Christie answered. A Wisconsin teen asked Ted Cruz to help him win a date to his prom on Wednesday, and the senator complied: \u201cthat\u2019s strong. I\u2019ve got to say, Alex, that\u2019s strong.\u201d But the teenager says that Cruz left out the final line of his note. Ted Cruz just spoke to Charlie Sykes, a conservative radio host, and used his time on Wisconsin\u2019s most prominent conservative radio to relentlessly belittle John Kasich. \u201cIf Kasich had dropped out before Illinois, I would have won Illinois and beaten Trump,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cWhat happened in Illinois could happen in subsequent states.\u201d He then took issue with Kasich\u2019s argument that he\u2019s the only Republican who can beat Hillary Clinton in a general election. \u201cYou\u2019re not electable if you can\u2019t win elections. He\u2019s lost 30 nationwide,\u201d he said, alluding to the race so far. Kasich has only won in his home state of Iowa, and has nearly 600 fewer delegates than Donald Trump. \u201cPart of the reason he does well against Hillary is that no one knows anything about him.\u201d Cruz threw in an aside about Trump\u2019s comments from Wednesday about \u201cpunishment\u201d for women who have illegal abortions. \u201cDonald\u2019s notion was bizarre and something with which I strongly disagree,\u201d Cruz said. The Texas senator has a narrow lead over Trump in Wisconsin, according to poll averages, and the state has a delegate system that awards 18 of its 42 delegates to the candidate who wins the state-wide vote. The remainder are awarded by Wisconsin\u2019s eight congressional districts: three each to the winner of each district. Running at 21% of the vote to Cruz\u2019s 33%, per the polls, Kasich could spoil the Texan\u2019s hopes to sweep all 42 delegates away from Trump. In perhaps the least surprising turn of the 2016 election, the National Border Patrol Council has endorsed the Republican candidate who means to build a massive border wall. \u201cUnlike his opponents, Donald Trump is not a career politician, he is an outsider who has created thousands of jobs, pledged to bring about aggressive pro-American change, and who is completely independent of special interests,\u201d the group said in a statement. \u201cWe don\u2019t need a person who has the perfect Washington-approved tone, and certainly NOT another establishment politician in the [White House]. \u201cIndeed, the fact that people are more upset about Mr. Trump\u2019s tone than about the destruction wrought by open borders tells us everything we need to know about the corruption in Washington.\u201d The group also praised Trump for enduring \u201cthe withering media storm\u201d. \u201cHe did not back down one iota. That tells you the measure of the man. \u201cWhen the so-called experts said he was too brash and outspoken, and that he would fade away, they were proven wrong. We are confident they will be proven wrong again in November when he becomes President of the United States.\u201d Earlier this week my colleague Paul Lewis met with families divided by a border wall that already exists. They often meet there at the barrier, for \u201camargo y dulce\u201d reunions. Kasich ends the press conference. Sanders has finished too. Bill Clinton is still meeting with voters in New York \u2013 and he\u2019s mentioned us! Or at least he\u2019s mentioned a Guardian column published on Monday, by Jill Abramson, the former editor of the New York Times. The Times\u2019 Amy Chozick is with the former president, who is hosting an \u201corganizing event\u201d in the city. Later this afternoon he\u2019ll be doing three more events, one in Chelsea, near the Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons, one in south Tribeca, just a few blocks from the World Trade Center, and one at the United Federation of Teachers\u2019 building, in the financial district. The events, unlike most staged by candidates themselves, are not being aired online. Bernie Sanders lands in the city this afternoon as well, to hold a rally up in the south Bronx, alongside actor Rosario Dawson. \u201cI am with the Trump people, they just don\u2019t know me,\u201d Kasich insists. \u201cThey see Coke, Pepsi and Kasich, when they\u2019re out shopping,\u201d he says. They go with what they know. He gets as close as he ever has to disavowing Trump the hypothetical nominee: \u201cIf he were the nominee, at that point, I would have to determine how I felt.\u201d Trump is \u201cpulling so many people apart,\u201d Kasich says. \u201cTerrible, atrocious\u201d attacks on women, on Muslims, on \u201cpeople who came here, came here illegally, but should have an opportunity to settle here, if they have not violated the law.\u201d \u201cAnd then these absolutely absurd statements,\u201d about building a wall and making Mexico pay for it. Kasich blames the press, or at least television, for giving so much airtime to the former reality TV star. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you people even deal with this,\u201d he says. \u201cYou also have a responsibility in this business!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s an unsettling time but people are looking for a way to express their frustrations, and he\u2019s a way to do it.\u201d Kasich takes a question. Will you support Donald Trump if he\u2019s the nominee. He doesn\u2019t really answer. He says he believes Trump will not have the 1,237 delegates to win the nomination outright. He doesn\u2019t think much of the other Republican in the race either. \u201cThere\u2019s a greater chance that you will fly out of this building,\u201d he says, \u201cand fly up to where the ball drops at the end of the year, than for Ted Cruz to have enough delegates to win the convention.\u201d Then he says he\u2019ll do well in New York, and be \u201cvery competitive\u201d in Pennsylvania. \u201cFinally people are starting to hear the message that I have, and begin to understand the record, understand who I am.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m the only one that, frankly, can win in the fall.\u201d He argues that delegates will take their jobs seriously at the convention this summer, and that if it goes past a first ballot chaos won\u2019t ensue. The reality TV tenor of the Republican race won\u2019t survive, he insists. It\u2019s going to be \u201cless Kardashians, more who\u2019s gonna be president.\u201d \u201cNot that I have anything against the Kardashians, let them know.\u201d CNN is not cooperating with his plea for seriousness. John Kasich is giving a press conference in midtown New York to address the many controversies of his Republican rival, Donald Trump. He\u2019s rattling off a long list of things Trump has said that make him unprepared, in Kasich\u2019s view (and many others\u2019) to be president. Yesterday\u2019s comments about abortion and the \u201cproblem\u201d of the Geneva Conventions. Last year\u2019s belittling of \u201cAmerican heroes\u201d who were prisoners of war, such as John McCain. His idea that \u201cNato is obsolete\u201d and his comments suggesting a ban and religious test for Muslims. Kasich says he believes \u201cthe religion of Islam has been hijacked by a handful of extremists\u201d and that the US should rally with Muslims around the world to counter it. \u201cFor those people who\u2019ve been fervent Trump supporters, their frustrations, their problems, do not fall on deaf ears for me,\u201d he says, mentioning stagnant wages, huge debts, labor woes of the working-class voters around the US \u2013 Trump\u2019s base. \u201cThere are a lot of people out there who say, \u2018why is no one speaking for me?\u2019\u201d \u201cI share their frustration,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m also a citizen, and I see what\u2019s happening \u2026 To the Trump voters, there\u2019s hope.\u201d He says Trump is moving in an \u201cunmoored, untethered fashion\u201d, and that he understands that Trump is \u201ca vessel\u201d for their frustrations. \u201cI want to offer myself up as a new vessel,\u201d he concludes. \u201cI take orders from no one other than my wife.\u201d Sanders continues with his stump speech, drawing the differences between him and Clinton. She supported free trade deals, he did and does not; she voted for the Iraq war and has supported military intervention abroad. \u201cNo more stupid wars that our young people die for,\u201d he says, attacking politicians who talk of increased military action. \u201cIt\u2019s not their kids that are going to go to war, it\u2019s your kids.\u201d \u201cWe are not addressing the real crises in this country,\u201d he says, boiling down his stump speech into bullets. \u201cCampaign finance system which is corrupt and is undermining American democracy,\u201d he says. \u201cDemocracy is not about billionaires buying elections.\u201d He adds to this voting rights, and the efforts to roll them back in southern states with laws that limit early voting, require photo ID, etc. \u201cI really get outraged by Republican governors who do not have the guts to participate in free and fair elections.\u201d \u201cIt is a rigged economy,\u201d he says, for crisis number three. \u201cThe top one tenth of 1% now own as much wealth as the bottom 90%.\u201d He goes after the Walton family, the owners of Walmart, and highlights them as the recipients of subsidies: \u201cget off of welfare, pay your workers a living.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit stupid when struggling, working-class family have to subsidize the wealthiest family in America. We\u2019re gonna end that.\u201d Minimum wage to $15 an hour. Expanded social security benefits. Equal pay for women. College loan forgiveness and free public college. Sanders says that young people are on course to have a worse standard of living than their standards,\u201cthe American dream in reverse.\u201d Climate change, a ban on fracking \u2013 a sensitive subject in western Pennsylvania, where the natural gas industry is immensely controversial \u2013 and the move away from fossil fuels toward developing renewable energy. Paying for all this with taxes on the rich, closing loopholes in corporate tax law. \u201cI have here this morning a major announcement to make in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,\u201d Sanders says. He\u2019s going to release \u201call of the transcripts of all of the speeches that I have given to Wall Street.\u201d \u201cAre you ready?\u201d \u201cHere they are!\u201d He throws his arms up into the air toward the crowd with a grin, and a little bit of \u201cwhoosh\u201d sound, too. \u201cNo transcripts, no speeches, not for $250,000, not for $2,000, not for $2,\u201d he continues, starting to channel Larry David. \u201cI just don\u2019t know why Wall Street has not invited me to speak before them. You know I\u2019ve got my cellphone on, I\u2019m waiting for the call!\u201d Then he gets back to the righteous anger of his stump speech: \u201cTheir greed, their recklessness, and their illegal behavior, has done enormous harm to millions of people in this country.\u201d He debuted the joke at a Democratic debate earlier this year, but the crowd doesn\u2019t mind at all. Clinton has said she\u2019s willing to release the transcripts of speeches she gave to Wall Street firms, in all for more than $2m, though she has not yet done so. Bernie Sanders is holding an event in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where a huge crowd has turned out to a convention center for his speech. \u201cLet me begin by introducing myself to the state of Pennsylvania,\u201d he says. \u201cI am a senator from the state of Vermont. I grew up in Brooklyn New York. My father came to this country at the age of 17 from Poland. And I grew up in Brooklyn in a three-and-a-half room, rent-controlled apartment. \u201cThe lessons that I learned growing up with a family that has to struggle economically, is a lesson I have not forgotten and never will forget.\u201d He gets a big ovation for that. \u201cWe started this campaign at 3% in the polls, he says. \u201cA lot has changed in the last 11 months.\u201d \u201cWe are fighting hard in Wisconsin, which has their primary on Tuesday, then in New York and then, on April 26, here in Pennsylvania!\u201d He\u2019s in a spirited mood, going on about how he can not only win the Democratic nomination, but that several polls show him beating Donald Trump by about 20 points in a general election. He contrasts his campaign with Hillary Clinton\u2019s, first by talking about her reliance on \u201cbig money\u201d. His campaign, he says does not \u201cbeg Super Pacs\u201d but has \u201cgone to the working class and the middle class\u201d. \u201cAnd in 11 months we have received more than six million individual campaign contributions. That is more contributions than any candidate in the history of the United States of America.\u201d The crowd is loving it, and boos vehemently when he brings up the \u201c$15m from Wall Street\u201d that has gone to Clinton\u2019s campaign. \u201cI think that if you get paid $250,000 a speech, it must be an extraordinary, mind-blowing, earth-shattering speech,\u201d he goes on. \u201cIt must be a speech written in Shakespearean prose.\u201d My colleague Mona Chalabi breaks down a new poll on the New York primary, as pollsters take stock of the state. The New York primary is a huge milestone in the Democratic nomination calendar. With 291 delegates available, it could be a game changer for presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders. At the moment, Sanders has lags behind Hillary Clinton by 263 pledged delegates and time is running out to close that gap. Previous opinion research has suggested that New York could be Bernie\u2019s undoing - so far this year, two polls have showed that Hillary Clinton has a 21-point lead in New York and one found that the former Secretary of State could win by as much as 48 points. With less than three weeks until New York votes, a new poll of voters conducted by Quinnipiac University offers some hope \u2013 it puts Clinton on 54% of the vote and Bernie on 42%. Donald Trump has released a letter from his tax lawyers, who say he hasn\u2019t released his federal tax returns \u2013 and in the process revealed what he\u2019s really worth \u2013 because of a 14-year continuous audit by the IRS. Trump\u2019s tax returns are \u201cinordinately large and complex for an individual\u201d, they write. The letter reads in part: \u201cYou [Trump] hold interests as the sole or principal owner in approximately 500 separate entities. These entities are collectively referred to and do business as The Trump Organization. These entities engage in hundreds of transactions, deals, and new enterprises every year. Because you operate these businesses almost exclusively through sole proprietorships and/or closely held partnerships, your personal federal income tax returns are inordinately large and complex for an individual. \u201cYour personal tax returns have been under continuous examination by the Internal Revenue Service since 2002, consistent with the IRS\u2019s practice for large and complex businesses. Examination of your tax returns for the years 2002 through 2008 have been closed administratively by agreement with the IRS without assessment or payment, on a net basis, of any deficiency. \u201cExaminations for returns for the 2009 year and forward are ongoing. Your returns for these years report items that are attributable to continuing transactions or activities that were also reported on returns for 2008 and earlier. In this sense, the pending examinations are continuations of prior, closed examinations.\u201d Translation: Trump is being audited, and he won\u2019t release the older tax returns because they\u2019re related to business that\u2019s being audited in the newer tax returns. But he could, legally, release any of them at any point. You can read the full letter here. Trump\u2019s critics have called for him to release the tax returns and reveal his true worth and business dealings; Mitt Romney, for instance, has suggested the returns contain a \u201cbombshell\u201d revelation. More prosaically, they could simply reveal that Trump is not worth the \u201cTEN BILLION DOLLARS\u201d [sic] that he told campaign finance officials he is worth. There are cracks in his claims to be worth billions, including at a golf course in upstate New York. Trump told the FEC that the property was worth $50m, but he told a judge that it\u2019s worth $1.4m as part of an argument that he should not have to pay high taxes on it. Retired senior military officers have denounced Donald Trump\u2019s description of the Geneva Conventions as a \u201cproblem\u201d, my colleague Spencer Ackerman reports. The former officers told him Trump\u2019s ideas range from the disgraceful to the illegal. \u201cDonald Trump cannot possibly understand [Geneva] because he has neither the experience, the expertise or the moral compass to grasp it,\u201d said Steve Kleinman, an air force reserve colonel and an interrogations expert. Geneva is \u201ca fundamental moral and tactical construct that serves as a foundation for the law of armed conflict, because all wars, including the global war on terror, come to an end. We as a community of nations need to engage with one another and not be separated by horrible, immoral treatment of one side over another,\u201d Kleinman said. At an appearance in Wisconsin, Trump said: \u201cThe problem is we have the Geneva Conventions, all sorts of rules and regulations, so the soldiers are afraid to fight.\u201d Trump has previously advocated killing the families of terror suspects, torture \u201ca hell of a lot worse\u201d than waterboarding, and widespread bombing campaigns against Islamic State, which operates in civilian-packed areas. The Geneva Conventions provide the basis for protections against war crimes, privileging the status of civilians and detainees during wartime. \u201cAmerica\u2019s military men and women swear to support and defend the constitution, including our obligations to adhere to treaties on the treatment of non-combatants,\u201d said Paul Yingling, a retired US army colonel. Yingling was the deputy commander of the armored cavalry regiment that recaptured the Iraqi city of Tall Afar from insurgents. He gained renown in military circles for criticizing the general officers who presided over the deterioration of the Iraq war. \u201cPrisoners of war and the family members of suspected terrorists are noncombatants. Torturing and murdering noncombatants are the actions of criminals and cowards. America\u2019s military men and women are neither,\u201d Yingling said. Christopher Harmer, a former navy pilot and current analyst at the Institute for the Study of War, said Trump\u2019s dismissal of Geneva demonstrated he was \u201cmonumentally unprepared\u201d for the White House. \u201cFrom advocating the assassination of women and children whose only crime is being related to terrorists, to speaking glibly of carpet bombing entire swaths of the Middle East, to opining that Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia should obtain nuclear weapons, Donald Trump comes across exactly as what he is: a reality TV star who has no idea about how US national security actually works in practice,\u201d Harmer said. \u201cHis candidacy is merely an embarrassment to the United States; if he were to actually become president, the damage he would do to our strategic relationships with our allies would be immense.\u201d Politico has learned where Donald Trump went off on Thursday after a week of blitzing the media and campaign trail with appearances. The businessman is in Washington DC for a private meeting with his new foreign policy team, the magazine reports. Trump for months had declined to name his foreign policy advisers, and has said that he largely relies on himself when it comes to matters of national security and international relations. \u201cI know what I\u2019m doing and I listen to a lot of people, I talk to a lot of people and at the appropriate time I\u2019ll tell you who the people are,\u201d Trump said earlier this month. \u201cBut my primary consultant is myself and I have a good instinct for this stuff.\u201d A week later, he rattled off the names of five men who are sources of regular advice on national security: Walid Phares, Carter Page, George Papadopoulos, Joe Schmitz, and Gen. Keith Kellogg. The list, however, provided little reassurance to those concerned about Trump\u2019s readiness to become commander in chief, as many of his named advisers are either unknowns or have mixed reputations among GOP national security pros. John Kasich has released a statement on Donald Trump declaring him \u201cnot prepared to be president\u201d. He still hasn\u2019t out and said he would not support Trump as the nominee, however. The statement reads in part: \u201cThe past 24 hours revealed in the clearest way yet that Donald Trump is not prepared to be president. On top of all his previous inflammatory statements, yesterday he proposed punishing women who received abortions, attacked the Geneva Conventions and said he\u2019d nominate supreme court justices based on who will look into Hillary Clinton\u2019s email scandal. Donald Trump is not ready to be commander in chief. He talks loosely about the use of nuclear weapons and of dismantling Nato. America is facing major challenges at home and abroad and cannot afford to elect a president who does not respect the seriousness of the office.\u201d Kasich was in New York yesterday meeting voters and local Republican politicians. His campaign does not list him for any events today. *Update: the campaign has announced Kasich will speak to the press in midtown New York, at 11.10am local time. He\u2019s going to appear at the Sheraton New York Times Square Hotel \u201cto address Trump comments\u201d, according to a release. Ted Cruz faced an unusual question on Wednesday night: \u201cWho do you like better, Obama or Trump?\u201d The senator was on Jimmy Kimmel Live, and joked with the comedian about hitting his opponent with a car. \u201cI dislike Obama\u2019s policies more, but Donald, uh, Donald is a unique individual,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cIf I were in my car and getting ready to reverse and saw Donald in the back-up camera, I\u2019m not confident which pedal I\u2019d push.\u201d They also talked about crying at Star Wars, Mueslix and Cruz appears to allude to the meme that he is the Zodiac killer. And Stephen Colbert also met with a prominent senator last night: Democrat Elizabeth Warren took to his CBS show to talk to talk about the election, and he pressed her on whether she supports Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders. She was cagey. He called her a \u201cVultron candidate\u201d. She made fun of Donald Trump. Bernie Sanders in the south Bronx, Hillary Clinton\u2019s off to upstate New York, Ted Cruz has his wife campaigning in Wisconsin and Donald Trump is \u2026 taking a break. Here\u2019s what\u2019s up on the schedule for Thursday, 31 March: Bernie Sanders is holding a rally in Pittsburgh this morning (tentatively 10.30 Eastern), with an eye to blue-collar Pennsylvanians who live in and around Steeltown. Hillary Clinton is near her home in Westchester, New York, for a rally at 1pm ET, while her husband Bill is down in the city holding three rallies on her behalf. Clinton also is scheduled for an event in Purchase, New York, and then set to head off to Boston, Massachusetts, for an \u201cevening fundraiser\u201d with Forest Whitaker and a fundraiser with the former president of the Boston Red Sox. Heidi Cruz and Carly Fiorina are stumping for the Texas senator in Green Bay, Appleton and Wausau, Wisconsin, today, at (10.30am, 12.45pm and 4.30pm local times, respectively). The campaign schedule doesn\u2019t list Ted Cruz himself as making an appearance, though he was in Los Angeles on Wednesday night and is likely fundraising, courting Republican leaders, etc. Sanders then departs the Keystone State for the south Bronx. He\u2019ll be holding an evening rally at Saint Mary\u2019s Park, a slice of green south of 149th St, with actor Rosario and Grammy winner Residente. Donald Trump is nowhere to be found \u2026 except for TV, where he is everywhere. His campaign schedule says his next event ins\u2019t until Saturday, in Wausau, Wisconsin. Hello and welcome to our rolling coverage of the 2016 campaign for the White House, a race dominated by one man and his indefatigable ability to upset: Donald Trump. On Wednesday, the Republican frontrunner for president said \u201cthere has to be some form of punishment\u201d for women who have illegal abortions. After a huge and swift outcry, including from members of his party, he retracted his statement, saying he supported granting states the authority to ban and prosecute. \u201cThe woman is a victim in this case as is the life in her womb. My position has not changed \u2013 like Ronald Reagan, I am pro-life with exceptions,\u201d he said in a statement. In 1999, when he was mulling a run for the presidency, Trump told NBC he was \u201cpro-choice in every respect\u201d. But his position has starkly changed as a 2016 candidate. The latest controversy from Trump came only a day after he turned the tables on conservative conventions, reneging on his pledge to support the Republican nominee no matter who ends up being selected. He abandoned the pledge only hours after Florida police charged his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, with battery against a reporter. Trump defended the aide, mocked the reporter and suggested her pen could well have been \u201ca little bomb\u201d. Looming over these controversies \u2013 not to mention Trump\u2019s suggestion that more Asian countries should develop nuclear weapons \u2013 is Wisconsin\u2019s primary on 5 April, where Trump will be put to the test. Texas senator Ted Cruz, endorsed by the governor there, narrowly leads Trump in an average of polls, 33.7% to 29.9%. Ohio governor John Kasich, adamantly staying in the race, trails at 21.8%. Cruz and Kasich hope to win enough delegates to force Trump into a contested convention this summer, where after an initial vote delegates will be unbound from state results. For Democrats, the focus is on both Wisconsin and New York, a state with 291 delegates at stake. The diverse electorate of working-class whites upstate, minority majorities in New York City, financiers and progressives has made for a surprisingly competitive race. Frontrunner Hillary Clinton represented the state in the Senate for two terms, and set up her headquarters in Brooklyn. Bernie Sanders grew up in the outer borough, retains his thick Brooklyn accent and has found ready allies in the young people and progressives who\u2019ve taken over the area. Both have turned their ire to the third New Yorker in the race, Trump, the lifelong emblem of city tabloids, skyscraper branding and the borough of Queens.",

Indeed, there are few sports more suited for politicians.</p> <p>First, there\u2019s the fact that yoga lets one project serenity, strength and wisdom simply by sitting on the floor with your legs crossed. You can also do yoga in a suit, and without any special equipment. This opens up a world of spontaneous PR opportunities. If things are going badly in parliament, you can simply stand on your head in the corridor as distraction.<br></p> <p>Yoga also has the advantage of being ultra-democratic. It\u2019s practised by the uber-rich, the not-very-rich and kids who have just got back from an enriching gap year in India. You can do yoga whatever your age, whatever your fitness levels. It doesn\u2019t alienate people in the way that hunting, polo or hang-gliding might.</p> <p>Then there are the holistic aspects of yoga \u2013 helpful in turbulent times. I am sound of body and mind, yoga says. I am flexible. I am calm. I am balanced. I will bend over backwards to help out my people.<strong> </strong></p>",

They\u2019re a sort of political peacocking that demonstrates to other world leaders that you could probably have them in a fight, should things get a bit dodgy in Davos. Vladimir Putin regularly scorches our collective eyeballs with unsolicited images of him doing various \u201cmanly\u201d activities, sometimes sans shirt. While yoga may be a far more subtle way of signalling strength than swimming in ice lakes or horse riding in Siberia, the current trend actually makes a lot of sense. Indeed, there are few sports more suited for politicians. First, there\u2019s the fact that yoga lets one project serenity, strength and wisdom simply by sitting on the floor with your legs crossed. You can also do yoga in a suit, and without any special equipment. This opens up a world of spontaneous PR opportunities. If things are going badly in parliament, you can simply stand on your head in the corridor as distraction. Yoga also has the advantage of being ultra-democratic. It\u2019s practised by the uber-rich, the not-very-rich and kids who have just got back from an enriching gap year in India. You can do yoga whatever your age, whatever your fitness levels. It doesn\u2019t alienate people in the way that hunting, polo or hang-gliding might. Then there are the holistic aspects of yoga \u2013 helpful in turbulent times. I am sound of body and mind, yoga says. I am flexible. I am calm. I am balanced. I will bend over backwards to help out my people.",

Wherever he went, he was swamped. People loved him,\u201d he said.</p> <p>On Monday, Toronto residents lined up in droves to pay tribute to Ford as he lay in repose at city hall, in an outpouring of affection for the popular politician whose common touch was often eclipsed by his colourful outbursts and and erratic behaviour.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/22/rob-ford-dies-cancer-former-toronto-mayor\">Ford died last Tuesday</a> after an 18-month battle with cancer.

Doing so would honour the late politician, as well as the many he touched during his career, said Neville. \u201cHe is the king of all mayors \u2013 he\u2019ll always be the king of all mayors.\u201d<br></p> <p>Hundreds of residents somberly filed past the casket on Monday, draped in the blue and white, maple leaf-emblazoned flag of Toronto.

Promising to \u201cstop the gravy train\u201d of government spending and put an end to what he called \u201cthe war on the car\u201d, his dogged focus on slashing spending was epitomised by his stubborn refusal to use a chauffeur, rack up office expenses or accept a security detail.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/23/canada-justin-trudeau-rob-ford-donald-trump\">Canada is Justin Trudeau, but it is also Rob Ford</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What emerged was a unique brand of politics that stood up for the working class and gave a voice to those left behind as the city grew more prosperous, said Reilly. \u201cThere\u2019s a very small minority of people in Toronto that champion the causes of the underdog and Rob Ford was one of those individuals. So his loss to Toronto is immense.\u201d </p> <p>A divisive figure, Ford was pilloried by critics over his steady stream of blunt comments, ranging from remarking that \u201coriental people work like dogs\u201d and calling Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, a \u201cfag\u201d. Viral videos showed Ford staggering around a room <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/07/toronto-mayor-video-surfaces-drunken-rant\">ranting about killing someone</a>, while another showed him calling the city police chief a derogatory name and attempting a Jamaican accent.</p> <p>His supporters rallied behind him, pointing to his everyman image and the concept of authenticity to explain the incidents. \u201cWhat he provided was a measure of truthfulness that is sorely lacking in politics in Canada today,\u201d said Reilly. \u201cI don\u2019t ever believe that anything he ever said or did was out of malice.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1f7410938c23ed68a156a4dcfa9057068ece7668\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f7410938c23ed68a156a4dcfa9057068ece7668/0_51_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A guard stands in front of the casket of former Toronto mayor Rob Ford.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A guard stands in front of the casket of former Toronto mayor Rob Ford.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Blinch/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As a city councillor in a working class district with a high immigrant population, Ford cultivated a reputation for being accessible, often handing out his home phone number and personally returning calls on issues that ranged from daycare waiting lists to broken water pipes. He continued the tradition when he became mayor, to the ire of those who wanted him to focus on the bigger-picture issues facing Toronto.</p> <p>Having heard of the mayor\u2019s reputation, Jimmy Christakis, a server at a high-end hotel in Toronto, put it to the test over a pothole. \u201cI had spoken to the councillor in my area who didn\u2019t do anything. So I called the mayor.\u201d Within two days Ford was on the line, returning his call. A week later, the issue was resolved. </p> <p>\u201cIt made me feel special. Councillors didn\u2019t have time, but yet the mayor of this big city somehow managed to find time,\u201d he said. On Monday, Christakis came to pay tribute to the man who had listened to him when nobody else would. </p> <p>In May 2013, reports emerged of a video that had shown Ford <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/05/toronto-mayor-rob-ford-admits-crack-use\">inhaling from a crack pipe</a>. The mayor initially denied the allegations, but was forced to backtrack months later when the Toronto police said they had found the recording. <br></p> <p> \u201cYes, I have smoked crack cocaine,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cBut, no, do I? Am I an addict? No. Have I tried it? Probably in one of my drunken stupors, probably approximately about a year ago.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/mar/22/rob-ford-former-mayor-of-toronto-has-died-aged-46-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4hnhz\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2477625\"            data-video-name=\"Rob Ford, former mayor of Toronto, has died aged 46 \u2014 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-56f18af0e4b0d8d383385abd\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/03/22/160322RobFordExplainer_v3_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/03/22/160322RobFordExplainer_v3_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/03/22/160322RobFordExplainer_v3_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/03/22/160322RobFordExplainer_v3_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/03/22/160322RobFordExplainer_v3.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/mar/22/rob-ford-former-mayor-of-toronto-has-died-aged-46-video\">A look back at the life of Rob Ford </a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The admission catapulted Ford into headlines around the world. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t the big picture of Rob Ford,\u201d said Elaine Morrison, who had come to pay her respects with her 83-year-old mother. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t the person we saw.\u201d </p> <p>As American late-night TV hosts skewered Ford nightly, his supporters saw themselves reflected in his very public shortcomings, even as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/05/toronto-mayor-rob-ford-crack-cocaine\">he refused to resign</a>. \u201cHe was human. I think maybe that\u2019s what made him more approachable to people,\u201d said Morrison. </p> <p>Those waiting to file past the casket on Monday included Julie Tonner, a flight attendant from Atlanta, Georgia, who had ended up in Toronto for work. \u201cI found him refreshing in an odd kind of way,\u201d she said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t always agree with everything he said or did, he could be a little bombastic and seemed kind of crazy, but he seemed honest.\u201d</p> <p>She waved off the suggestion of any parallel <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/23/canada-justin-trudeau-rob-ford-donald-trump\">between Ford and Republican frontrunner Donald Trump</a>. \u201cI can\u2019t see Donald Trump calling somebody at their house or getting a wedding invitation and replying with $300 [and] saying, I can\u2019t be there, but good luck in your married life,\u201d she said. \u201cDonald Trump collects things, and I think Rob Ford was real.\u201d </p> <p>The repose will continue on Tuesday. On Wednesday, the coffin will be carried in a procession from city hall to St James Cathedral for the funeral. A private ceremony will follow, but a public celebration of Ford\u2019s life is being planned for Wednesday evening.</p>",

          "bodyText": "The lapels of his suit covered in red and blue Rob Ford campaign merchandise, Kenny Neville voice rose with excitement as he described what made the late mayor of Toronto different from any other politician in Canada. \u201cI can sum it up in one word: people.\u201d Neville had experienced Ford\u2019s appeal firsthand when he volunteered on Ford\u2019s second mayoral campaign in 2014. \u201cTo go with him everywhere he went was special. Wherever he went, he was swamped. People loved him,\u201d he said. On Monday, Toronto residents lined up in droves to pay tribute to Ford as he lay in repose at city hall, in an outpouring of affection for the popular politician whose common touch was often eclipsed by his colourful outbursts and and erratic behaviour. Ford died last Tuesday after an 18-month battle with cancer. He was 46. Neville urged the city council to consider designating 22 March \u2013 the date of Ford\u2019s death \u2013 Rob Ford Day. Doing so would honour the late politician, as well as the many he touched during his career, said Neville. \u201cHe is the king of all mayors \u2013 he\u2019ll always be the king of all mayors.\u201d Hundreds of residents somberly filed past the casket on Monday, draped in the blue and white, maple leaf-emblazoned flag of Toronto. Those who came were a diverse group, dressed in everything from suits and high heels to sweatpants. Some shed a tear as they said goodbye, others said a prayer. \u201cWe lost a tremendous voice,\u201d said Patricia Reilly as she waited in line to pay her respects. \u201cHe was the voice of the little guy, the little girl, the little family.\u201d A city councillor since 2000, Ford vaulted into Toronto\u2019s top office in 2010 by tapping into suburban resentment over the city\u2019s focus on urban issues such as bike lanes and green roofs. Promising to \u201cstop the gravy train\u201d of government spending and put an end to what he called \u201cthe war on the car\u201d, his dogged focus on slashing spending was epitomised by his stubborn refusal to use a chauffeur, rack up office expenses or accept a security detail. What emerged was a unique brand of politics that stood up for the working class and gave a voice to those left behind as the city grew more prosperous, said Reilly. \u201cThere\u2019s a very small minority of people in Toronto that champion the causes of the underdog and Rob Ford was one of those individuals. So his loss to Toronto is immense.\u201d A divisive figure, Ford was pilloried by critics over his steady stream of blunt comments, ranging from remarking that \u201coriental people work like dogs\u201d and calling Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, a \u201cfag\u201d. Viral videos showed Ford staggering around a room ranting about killing someone, while another showed him calling the city police chief a derogatory name and attempting a Jamaican accent. His supporters rallied behind him, pointing to his everyman image and the concept of authenticity to explain the incidents. \u201cWhat he provided was a measure of truthfulness that is sorely lacking in politics in Canada today,\u201d said Reilly. \u201cI don\u2019t ever believe that anything he ever said or did was out of malice.\u201d As a city councillor in a working class district with a high immigrant population, Ford cultivated a reputation for being accessible, often handing out his home phone number and personally returning calls on issues that ranged from daycare waiting lists to broken water pipes. He continued the tradition when he became mayor, to the ire of those who wanted him to focus on the bigger-picture issues facing Toronto. Having heard of the mayor\u2019s reputation, Jimmy Christakis, a server at a high-end hotel in Toronto, put it to the test over a pothole. \u201cI had spoken to the councillor in my area who didn\u2019t do anything. So I called the mayor.\u201d Within two days Ford was on the line, returning his call. A week later, the issue was resolved. \u201cIt made me feel special. Councillors didn\u2019t have time, but yet the mayor of this big city somehow managed to find time,\u201d he said. On Monday, Christakis came to pay tribute to the man who had listened to him when nobody else would. In May 2013, reports emerged of a video that had shown Ford inhaling from a crack pipe. The mayor initially denied the allegations, but was forced to backtrack months later when the Toronto police said they had found the recording. \u201cYes, I have smoked crack cocaine,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cBut, no, do I? Am I an addict? No. Have I tried it? Probably in one of my drunken stupors, probably approximately about a year ago.\u201d The admission catapulted Ford into headlines around the world. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t the big picture of Rob Ford,\u201d said Elaine Morrison, who had come to pay her respects with her 83-year-old mother. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t the person we saw.\u201d As American late-night TV hosts skewered Ford nightly, his supporters saw themselves reflected in his very public shortcomings, even as he refused to resign. \u201cHe was human. I think maybe that\u2019s what made him more approachable to people,\u201d said Morrison. Those waiting to file past the casket on Monday included Julie Tonner, a flight attendant from Atlanta, Georgia, who had ended up in Toronto for work. \u201cI found him refreshing in an odd kind of way,\u201d she said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t always agree with everything he said or did, he could be a little bombastic and seemed kind of crazy, but he seemed honest.\u201d She waved off the suggestion of any parallel between Ford and Republican frontrunner Donald Trump. \u201cI can\u2019t see Donald Trump calling somebody at their house or getting a wedding invitation and replying with $300 [and] saying, I can\u2019t be there, but good luck in your married life,\u201d she said. \u201cDonald Trump collects things, and I think Rob Ford was real.\u201d The repose will continue on Tuesday. On Wednesday, the coffin will be carried in a procession from city hall to St James Cathedral for the funeral. A private ceremony will follow, but a public celebration of Ford\u2019s life is being planned for Wednesday evening.",

It can only be surprising to those who rushed to judgment before the trial had started and before a single word of evidence had been heard,\u201d she said.</p> <p>As Ghomeshi and his legal team left the courtroom, a group of protesters gathered outside the courthouse chanting: \u201cWe believe survivors.\u201d</p> <p>Michael Callaghan, the crown prosecutor, told reporters that he and his team would take the weekend to look at the judgment and consider their position. \u201cWe just received the judgment,\u201d he said, noting that they have 30 days to appeal against the ruling. </p> <p>Callaghan\u2019s remarks were interrupted by a topless protester who jumped in front of him, yelling \u201cGhomeshi\u2019s guilty\u201d. Police quickly tackled the woman to the ground. </p> <p>Jacob Jesin, the lawyer for one of the complainants, read a statement on behalf of his client, who thanked those who supported her during the trial. \u201cI always understood that a conviction would be difficult,\u201d she said in her statement. \u201cThe story may not have passed the high legal test for proof (but) it remains my position that the evidence of the substantive issues is truthful.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c4c7fdbb0e4e46e94b9bb9fd9a011ef9443dee13\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c4c7fdbb0e4e46e94b9bb9fd9a011ef9443dee13/0_14_2200_1319/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jian Ghomeshi leaves court after getting bail on multiple counts of sexual assault in 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jian Ghomeshi leaves court after getting bail on multiple counts of sexual assault in 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Blinch/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It took Horkin more than an hour to read out his 25-page judgment. In explaining his decision, the judge pointed to the evidence of the three complainants. \u201cEach complainant demonstrated, to some degree, a willingness to ignore their oath to tell the truth on more than one occasion. It is this aspect of their evidence that is most troubling to the court.\u201d</p> <p>The judge said the evidence provided by the first complainant \u2013 who alleged Ghomeshi <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/01/jian-ghomeshi-trial-opens-canada-ex-radio-host\">forcefully pulled her hair and struck her multiple times</a> on the side of the head in two separate encounters \u2013 had initially seemed rational and balanced. </p> <p>But Horkin said that the value of her evidence \u201csuffered irreparable damage\u201d when she was \u201cexposed as a witness willing to withhold relevant information\u201d from the police and the court. \u201cIt is clear that she deliberately breached her oath to tell the truth. Her value as a reliable witness is diminished accordingly.\u201d</p> <p>In the case of the second complainant, identified as Lucy DeCoutere after she waived a publication ban on her identity, the judge pointed to inconsistencies in what she told the court and media about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/04/jian-ghomeshi-witness-lucy-decoutere\">allegations that Ghomeshi choked her and slapped her without consent</a>. \u201cIt suggests a degree of carelessness with the truth that diminishes the general reliability of the witness,\u201d the judge said.</p> <p>In the case of the third complainant, who testified that Ghomeshi began roughly squeezing her neck as they were kissing on a park bench, the judge pointed to her revelation that she had engaged in sexual activity with Ghomeshi after the alleged assault.</p> <p>She had previously told crown counsel that she had tried to keep her distance from Ghomeshi after the alleged assault, meeting with him only in public, said the judge. \u201cIn assessing the credibility of a witness, the active suppression of the truth will be as damaging to their reliability as a direct lie under oath,\u201d said the judge.</p> <p>He also pointed to the exchange of some 5,000 emails between her and DeCoutere after the allegations against Ghomeshi became public, some of which discussed strategies to use in pursuing charges against Ghomeshi. While the women\u2019s \u201cextreme dedication to bringing down Mr Ghomeshi\u201d could reflect the legitimate feelings of victims of abuse, the judge said it raised the need for the court to proceed with caution.</p> <p>Lenore Lukasik-Foss, of the Hamilton Sexual Assault Centre, said she was shocked by the ruling, which was laced with words such as \u201cdeception\u201d and \u201cmanipulative\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cThe kind of language and the examples he was using just demonstrates his complete lack of knowledge around sexual violence and dynamics around abuse that happens between folks who are known to each other,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Lukasik-Foss said her centre had already seen an uptick in the number of survivors reaching out for support in the wake of the decision. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty bleak day.\u201d</p> <p>The high-profile trial gave Canadians an unprecedented glimpse into how the justice system deals with allegations of sexual assault. The portrait that emerged for many was of a flawed system riddled with challenges for complainants, said Lukasik-Foss. </p> <p>\u201cI want rigorous defense. But we see that this is not a system that is equipped to deal with sexual violence,\u201d she said. </p> <p>The trial also underlined the gap between a victim\u2019s memory of traumatic events and the demands of the criminal justice system, said Nicole Pietsch, of the Ontario Coalition of Rape Crisis Centres. Many survivors of sexual trauma attempt to repress their memory, only to face intense questioning \u2013 often months or years later \u2013 when their case reaches trial. </p> <p>\u201cMost of us can\u2019t recall what we wore to an event last week,\u201d she said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/24/jian-ghomeshi-trial-why-prosecution-fell-apart\">Jian Ghomeshi trial: why the prosecution's case fell apart</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Asked about the case in a television interview, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau refused to comment but when asked about worries that the verdict may discourage survivors from coming forward in the future, he noted, \u201cI think these are the kinds of discussions we need to be having as a society that values and has respect for women.\u201d</p> <p>Others were more outspoken: Toronto city councillor Kristyn Wong-Tam said that the verdict \u201cwould not in any way undermine or repudiate the reality\u201d of the complainants\u2019 experiences.</p> <p>In a statement addressing the three women, she said: \u201cWe believe you \u2013 and we thank you for inspiring us with your courage by coming forward to tell your story and to fight for the belief that no matter how many years have passed, or how wealthy or well-respected the abuser is, sexual violence will not be tolerated in Canada.\u201d</p> <p>Ghomeshi now faces a second trial in June, stemming from allegations that he touched the buttocks of a former CBC employee and said to her: \u201cI want to hate-fuck you.\u201d</p> <p>Managers of CBC apologised last year to their employees and audience after a damning report <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/16/cbc-apologises-report-failure-stop-jian-ghomesi\">concluded they knew of Ghomeshi\u2019s inappropriate behaviour</a> but chose to instead protect the popular radio host. </p> <p>The public broadcaster said that Thursday\u2019s verdict would have no impact on its decision to fire Ghomeshi in 2014. \u201cWe stand by this decision.\u201d</p>",

          "bodyText": "Former Canadian radio star Jian Ghomeshi has been acquitted of all charges in the first trial to emerge from the barrage of allegations against the prominent celebrity. After more than a month of deliberation, Judge William Horkins on Thursday found Ghomeshi, 48, not guilty of four counts of sexual assault and one count of choking, dating back to 2002 and 2003. Horkins said prosecutors had failed to establish Ghomeshi\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and highlighted inconsistencies in the testimonies of the three female complainants. The judge said that the crown\u2019s case relied solely on the word of the witnesses. \u201cThere is no other evidence to look to determine the truth. There is no tangible evidence. There is no DNA. There is no \u2018smoking gun\u2019,\u201d he said. The Ghomeshi case was one of the country\u2019s most high-profile trials in recent memory, and it sparked a national conversation on consent and sexual assault \u2013 and prompted fresh questions over the justice system\u2019s ability to address allegations of sexual violence. Those who work with sexual assault survivors said that Thursday\u2019s decision would have a chilling effect on victims\u2019 willingness to come forward. When they first emerged in the fall of 2014, the accusations stunned the country. Ghomeshi was a rising star at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, celebrated for his thoughtful interviews and socially progressive views. Eventually more than 20 women came forward with allegations of being slapped, punched, bitten, choked or smothered by the radio host. Ghomeshi denied the accusations, pleading not guilty to four charges of sexual assault and another of choking to overcome resistance. Delivering his verdict, Horkins stressed the acquittal was not the same as asserting the events in question never happened. But he said that in the course of the trial it became clear that each witness was \u201cless than full and frank and forthcoming\u201d in their statements to media, police and the court. In his decision Horkins said that \u201cmy conclusion that the evidence in this case raises a reasonable doubt is not the same as deciding in any positive way that these events never happened\u201d. Moments after the judge read his decision, the three complainants left the courtroom with tears in their eyes. Ghomeshi\u2019s mother and sister, who attended every day of the eight-day trial, hugged each other and Ghomeshi and embraced with his defense lawyer Marie Henein. Outside the courtroom, Ghomeshi\u2019s sister Jila read a brief statement from his family. \u201cWe are relieved but not surprised by the court decision today. It can only be surprising to those who rushed to judgment before the trial had started and before a single word of evidence had been heard,\u201d she said. As Ghomeshi and his legal team left the courtroom, a group of protesters gathered outside the courthouse chanting: \u201cWe believe survivors.\u201d Michael Callaghan, the crown prosecutor, told reporters that he and his team would take the weekend to look at the judgment and consider their position. \u201cWe just received the judgment,\u201d he said, noting that they have 30 days to appeal against the ruling. Callaghan\u2019s remarks were interrupted by a topless protester who jumped in front of him, yelling \u201cGhomeshi\u2019s guilty\u201d. Police quickly tackled the woman to the ground. Jacob Jesin, the lawyer for one of the complainants, read a statement on behalf of his client, who thanked those who supported her during the trial. \u201cI always understood that a conviction would be difficult,\u201d she said in her statement. \u201cThe story may not have passed the high legal test for proof (but) it remains my position that the evidence of the substantive issues is truthful.\u201d It took Horkin more than an hour to read out his 25-page judgment. In explaining his decision, the judge pointed to the evidence of the three complainants. \u201cEach complainant demonstrated, to some degree, a willingness to ignore their oath to tell the truth on more than one occasion. It is this aspect of their evidence that is most troubling to the court.\u201d The judge said the evidence provided by the first complainant \u2013 who alleged Ghomeshi forcefully pulled her hair and struck her multiple times on the side of the head in two separate encounters \u2013 had initially seemed rational and balanced. But Horkin said that the value of her evidence \u201csuffered irreparable damage\u201d when she was \u201cexposed as a witness willing to withhold relevant information\u201d from the police and the court. \u201cIt is clear that she deliberately breached her oath to tell the truth. Her value as a reliable witness is diminished accordingly.\u201d In the case of the second complainant, identified as Lucy DeCoutere after she waived a publication ban on her identity, the judge pointed to inconsistencies in what she told the court and media about allegations that Ghomeshi choked her and slapped her without consent. \u201cIt suggests a degree of carelessness with the truth that diminishes the general reliability of the witness,\u201d the judge said. In the case of the third complainant, who testified that Ghomeshi began roughly squeezing her neck as they were kissing on a park bench, the judge pointed to her revelation that she had engaged in sexual activity with Ghomeshi after the alleged assault. She had previously told crown counsel that she had tried to keep her distance from Ghomeshi after the alleged assault, meeting with him only in public, said the judge. \u201cIn assessing the credibility of a witness, the active suppression of the truth will be as damaging to their reliability as a direct lie under oath,\u201d said the judge. He also pointed to the exchange of some 5,000 emails between her and DeCoutere after the allegations against Ghomeshi became public, some of which discussed strategies to use in pursuing charges against Ghomeshi. While the women\u2019s \u201cextreme dedication to bringing down Mr Ghomeshi\u201d could reflect the legitimate feelings of victims of abuse, the judge said it raised the need for the court to proceed with caution. Lenore Lukasik-Foss, of the Hamilton Sexual Assault Centre, said she was shocked by the ruling, which was laced with words such as \u201cdeception\u201d and \u201cmanipulative\u201d. \u201cThe kind of language and the examples he was using just demonstrates his complete lack of knowledge around sexual violence and dynamics around abuse that happens between folks who are known to each other,\u201d she said. Lukasik-Foss said her centre had already seen an uptick in the number of survivors reaching out for support in the wake of the decision. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty bleak day.\u201d The high-profile trial gave Canadians an unprecedented glimpse into how the justice system deals with allegations of sexual assault. The portrait that emerged for many was of a flawed system riddled with challenges for complainants, said Lukasik-Foss. \u201cI want rigorous defense. But we see that this is not a system that is equipped to deal with sexual violence,\u201d she said. The trial also underlined the gap between a victim\u2019s memory of traumatic events and the demands of the criminal justice system, said Nicole Pietsch, of the Ontario Coalition of Rape Crisis Centres. Many survivors of sexual trauma attempt to repress their memory, only to face intense questioning \u2013 often months or years later \u2013 when their case reaches trial. \u201cMost of us can\u2019t recall what we wore to an event last week,\u201d she said. Asked about the case in a television interview, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau refused to comment but when asked about worries that the verdict may discourage survivors from coming forward in the future, he noted, \u201cI think these are the kinds of discussions we need to be having as a society that values and has respect for women.\u201d Others were more outspoken: Toronto city councillor Kristyn Wong-Tam said that the verdict \u201cwould not in any way undermine or repudiate the reality\u201d of the complainants\u2019 experiences. In a statement addressing the three women, she said: \u201cWe believe you \u2013 and we thank you for inspiring us with your courage by coming forward to tell your story and to fight for the belief that no matter how many years have passed, or how wealthy or well-respected the abuser is, sexual violence will not be tolerated in Canada.\u201d Ghomeshi now faces a second trial in June, stemming from allegations that he touched the buttocks of a former CBC employee and said to her: \u201cI want to hate-fuck you.\u201d Managers of CBC apologised last year to their employees and audience after a damning report concluded they knew of Ghomeshi\u2019s inappropriate behaviour but chose to instead protect the popular radio host. The public broadcaster said that Thursday\u2019s verdict would have no impact on its decision to fire Ghomeshi in 2014. \u201cWe stand by this decision.\u201d",

          "body": "<h2>US</h2> <p>The hardline drug policies adopted during the 1980s in the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d, including mandatory minimum sentences for some drug-related crimes, has led to extremely high levels of incarceration in the country. The US has more than 2 million people in its jails \u2013 the second highest rate of incarceration per capita in the world \u2013 about half of whom were convicted of drugs-related crimes.</p> <h2>UK</h2> <p>In the first half of the 20th century, doctors in the UK were allowed to prescribe drugs including morphine and cocaine to addicts \u2013 during this period there was a relatively low amount of drug use. In 1964, the UK introduced the first of several laws that would make it a criminal offence for individuals to possess drugs. The country now has, by some estimates, the highest level of dependent drug use in Europe \u2013 the number of dependent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/sep/03/uk-sees-huge-rise-in-heroin-and-morphine-related-deaths\">heroin</a> users <a href=\"https://kar.kent.ac.uk/13332/1/analysis_of_UK_drug_policy.pdf\">increa</a><a href=\"https://kar.kent.ac.uk/13332/1/analysis_of_UK_drug_policy.pdf\">sed (pdf)</a> from about 5,000 across the UK in 1975 to about 281,000 in England alone in 2007.</p> <h2>Australia</h2> <p>In the 1980s, Australia was one of the first countries to enact the policy of \u201charm minimisation\u201d, which involves reducing supply of drugs, education policies that aim to cut demand, and minimising harm caused by drugs on the user and community, through initiatives such as needle programs and safe injecting sites. Despite this, a major international <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/aug/29/drugs-health-australia-youth-culture\">study</a> warned in 2013 that Australia had \u201cone of the world\u2019s most serious drug problems\u201d, particularly regarding opioid and cannabis use.</p> <h2>Portugal</h2> <p>Portugal changed its drug laws in 2001, making possession for personal use an administrative rather than a criminal offence \u2013 punished by fines and community service rather than jail time. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/05/portugal-drugs-debate\">The policy</a> is widely regarded as successful with decreased rate of HIV infections among drug users, a drop in deaths among heroin users, a dramatic increase in addicts seeking treatment, and no increase in drug use.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"54bc5f3e38d159ffb997eed115a6d0c7d9c285f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/54bc5f3e38d159ffb997eed115a6d0c7d9c285f3/162_125_3734_2241/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A drug dealer in Lisbon, Portugal, holds cannabis products\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A drug dealer in Lisbon, Portugal, holds cannabis products.

In 2009, the Czech government began allowing people to possess small quantities of marijuana and heroin without facing criminal charges. Production and trafficking of drugs, as well as possession of larger quantities, is illegal. Cannabis has been legally available for medical purposes since 2013.</p> <h2>Canada</h2> <p>Became the first country to legalise the use of cannabis by terminally ill patients in 2001. There have been strong campaigns around the country to legalise cannabis. In 2015, the Vancouver government <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/24/vancouver-regulate-illegal-marijuana-stores-canada\">introduced rules to license and regulate marijuana stores</a>, to the consternation of federal government, though the newly elected Liberal prime minister, Justin Trudeau, ran on a drug <a href=\"https://www.liberal.ca/realchange/marijuana/\">platform</a> which promised to \u201clegalise, regulate and restrict access to marijuana\u201d. </p> <h2>Peru</h2> <p>One of the world\u2019s largest producers of coca leaf, Peru traditionally adopted policies of prohibition and punishment. However, changes to the <a href=\"http://druglawreform.info/en/country-information/latin-america/peru/item/207-peru\">criminal code</a>, introduced in 2003, have relaxed this policy, making possession of drugs in small quantities for immediate use \u201cnot punishable\u201d. This applies to cocaine, marijuana, opium and ecstasy. However, possession of two or more types of drugs is punishable, as is trafficking drugs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c3c867eba31d5720f4fb31e446cd26f771de1ddb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c3c867eba31d5720f4fb31e446cd26f771de1ddb/194_170_3306_1984/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Peruvian policeman holds a brick of cocaine following a raid\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Peruvian policeman holds a brick of cocaine following a raid on an apartment in Miraflores, Lima, earlier this month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guadelupe Pardo/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Indonesia</h2> <p>Drug laws in Indonesia are notoriously strict. Possession of illicit drugs is punished by jail time and hefty fines and drug trafficking carries long jail sentences or the death penalty. The government has recently introduced provisions that allow people convicted of drug possession to go through rehabilitation rather than prison, in some cases.</p> <h2>United Arab Emirates</h2> <p>The UAE has one of the world\u2019s longest lists of prohibited substances. Possession of drugs commonly available in other countries \u2013 such as codeine and some antidepressants \u2013 can lead to criminal charges and a potential jail sentence. The UAE also enforces the death penalty in cases of drug trafficking. The presence of illegal drugs detected in blood or urine is considered possession and can lead to prison time, even in very small, trace amounts.</p> <h2>Iran</h2> <p>Iran has a very mixed drug policy. It mandates harsh penalties for possession, which can result in public lashing, and for drug trafficking. Approximately 70% of all executions in the country are for drug-related crimes. But the country, which has one of the highest drug addiction rates in the world, has received praise for progressive policies relating to treating addiction, including government-supported clean needle programs.</p>",

          "bodyText": "US The hardline drug policies adopted during the 1980s in the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d, including mandatory minimum sentences for some drug-related crimes, has led to extremely high levels of incarceration in the country. The US has more than 2 million people in its jails \u2013 the second highest rate of incarceration per capita in the world \u2013 about half of whom were convicted of drugs-related crimes. UK In the first half of the 20th century, doctors in the UK were allowed to prescribe drugs including morphine and cocaine to addicts \u2013 during this period there was a relatively low amount of drug use. In 1964, the UK introduced the first of several laws that would make it a criminal offence for individuals to possess drugs. The country now has, by some estimates, the highest level of dependent drug use in Europe \u2013 the number of dependent heroin users increased (pdf) from about 5,000 across the UK in 1975 to about 281,000 in England alone in 2007. Australia In the 1980s, Australia was one of the first countries to enact the policy of \u201charm minimisation\u201d, which involves reducing supply of drugs, education policies that aim to cut demand, and minimising harm caused by drugs on the user and community, through initiatives such as needle programs and safe injecting sites. Despite this, a major international study warned in 2013 that Australia had \u201cone of the world\u2019s most serious drug problems\u201d, particularly regarding opioid and cannabis use. Portugal Portugal changed its drug laws in 2001, making possession for personal use an administrative rather than a criminal offence \u2013 punished by fines and community service rather than jail time. The policy is widely regarded as successful with decreased rate of HIV infections among drug users, a drop in deaths among heroin users, a dramatic increase in addicts seeking treatment, and no increase in drug use. Czech Republic The second most liberal country in Europe regarding drug legalisation. In 2009, the Czech government began allowing people to possess small quantities of marijuana and heroin without facing criminal charges. Production and trafficking of drugs, as well as possession of larger quantities, is illegal. Cannabis has been legally available for medical purposes since 2013. Canada Became the first country to legalise the use of cannabis by terminally ill patients in 2001. There have been strong campaigns around the country to legalise cannabis. In 2015, the Vancouver government introduced rules to license and regulate marijuana stores, to the consternation of federal government, though the newly elected Liberal prime minister, Justin Trudeau, ran on a drug platform which promised to \u201clegalise, regulate and restrict access to marijuana\u201d. Peru One of the world\u2019s largest producers of coca leaf, Peru traditionally adopted policies of prohibition and punishment. However, changes to the criminal code, introduced in 2003, have relaxed this policy, making possession of drugs in small quantities for immediate use \u201cnot punishable\u201d. This applies to cocaine, marijuana, opium and ecstasy. However, possession of two or more types of drugs is punishable, as is trafficking drugs. Indonesia Drug laws in Indonesia are notoriously strict. Possession of illicit drugs is punished by jail time and hefty fines and drug trafficking carries long jail sentences or the death penalty. The government has recently introduced provisions that allow people convicted of drug possession to go through rehabilitation rather than prison, in some cases. United Arab Emirates The UAE has one of the world\u2019s longest lists of prohibited substances. Possession of drugs commonly available in other countries \u2013 such as codeine and some antidepressants \u2013 can lead to criminal charges and a potential jail sentence. The UAE also enforces the death penalty in cases of drug trafficking. The presence of illegal drugs detected in blood or urine is considered possession and can lead to prison time, even in very small, trace amounts. Iran Iran has a very mixed drug policy. It mandates harsh penalties for possession, which can result in public lashing, and for drug trafficking. Approximately 70% of all executions in the country are for drug-related crimes. But the country, which has one of the highest drug addiction rates in the world, has received praise for progressive policies relating to treating addiction, including government-supported clean needle programs.",

Harper\u2019s Conservatives were swept from government. Justin Trudeau took the stage on election night and declared a new era of \u201csunny ways\u201d. But as progressive Americans looks north with envy and Canadians gleefully gloat about the return of our bright side, it\u2019s important to remember the dark side too. Canada is Justin Trudeau, but it is also Rob Ford.",

Except all over the world, people are defying it for a greater cause. That courage may be even more contagious.</p> <p>It has been in full supply in north-west Canada, where an oil giant is aiming to construct one of the country\u2019s biggest fossil fuel developments: a pipeline to ship liquified natural gas (LNG) out of British Colombia. To export it overseas via tankers, Malaysian-owned Petronas must first win approval for a multi-billion dollar terminal on the coast.</p> <p>That happens to be at the mouth of Canada\u2019s second-largest salmon river, on the traditional territory of the Lax Kw\u2019alaams First Nation. One of the world\u2019s longest un-dammed rivers, the Skeena abounds in the fish relied on by surrounding wildlife \u2014 and by First Nations and an entire regional economy.</p> <p>Last year, following our modern principle, Petronas offered the First Nation an offer they imagined couldn\u2019t be refused: in exchange for their support, a whopping $1.15 billion in cash. But put to a vote, the Lax Kw\u2019alaams resoundingly said \u201cno\u201d \u2014 every single community member.</p> <p>When Petronas made the offer, Lax Kw\u2019alaams hereditary chief Yahaan says he believed the community \u2014 poor and with few employment prospects \u2014 might vote yes.</p> <p>\u201cOpportunities like that don\u2019t come to your door every day,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I give my people credit for taking that bold step. They showed their love and their passion for the land and water. No amount of money can compare to the richness of the river and what it gives us.\u201d</p> <p>They knew something even a billion dollars couldn\u2019t persuade them to ignore: that you couldn\u2019t pick a worse place to transform into an industrial landscape. The proposed site for the LNG plant is smack in the middle of a unique estuary, a coastal Mecca for fish: where every year hundreds of millions of young salmon, having travelled down the river after birth, feed and nurture as part of their journey to adulthood.</p> <p>When the British Columbia government gave Petronas a green-light anyway \u2014 ignoring the unanimous \u2018no\u2019 vote and the legal duty to consult all impacted First Nations \u2014 Yahaan and community members sprung into action. In the summer of 2015 they set up camp on Lelu island, right in the path of Petronas at the mouth of the river. Monitoring the area on boats, they peacefully turned away workers from sensitive sites. </p> <p>The camp, still up today, is a defence not just of wild salmon and aboriginal rights. Like many such outposts manned by Indigenous peoples across Canada, it is a defence of an entire worldview. On one side stands a government \u2014 wedded to an extractivist mentality \u2014 that is bent on carving up the province with tens of thousands of fracking wells. It promises an extravagant illusion of 100,000 jobs, which in truth <a href=\"https://www.policyalternatives.ca/newsroom/news-releases/government-claims-lng-jobs-grossly-overstated-not-supported-companies%E2%80%99-own\">amount</a> to just a few thousand that will vanish as this resource boom, like all others, goes bust. And as Indigenous peoples\u2019 rights have become more powerful, the government and its corporate partners have responded the way they know how: hiking the sums by which to buy them off.</p> <p>On the other side, the salmon protectors, feeding tens of thousands and supporting a commercial and recreational economy crucial to British Columbians. Promoting an abundance of life instead of threatening to extinguish it. Taking care with the land so that it can take care of people. Getting by on what the earth can continually restore rather than depleting forever what lies beneath. </p> <p>This is an Indigenous outlook, but one ever more people share. It is in sync with the knowledge that our energy sources must work not against natural cycles but with them \u2014 harnessing the power of the sun, water and wind. This can provide jobs in far greater numbers than fossil fuels. And this is the kind of economy we need more of: regenerating naturally, creating enduring local benefits, existing in balance with the natural world. It is, in other words, everything a dirty energy economy is not.</p> <p>The most dangerous imbalance of all that would be generated by this industrial project, Yahaan says, has only deepened the community\u2019s opposition: its contribution to climate change. Far from clean, emissions from an LNG industry would shatter the provincial government\u2019s emission targets. The Petronas plant and its associated fracking alone could <a href=\"http://www.pembina.org/media-release/pacific-northwest-lng-could-become-largest-carbon-polluter-in-canada\">become</a> the country\u2019s largest carbon polluter. </p> <p>All this means that the courageous resistance of this First Nation has put Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s climate plan on trial. The new Liberal government \u2014 which will have final say on the project \u2014 has raised enormous expectations. And raised those of First Nations: as Trudeau has <a href=\"http://www.msn.com/en-ca/video/news/trudeau-governments-grant-permits-communities-grant-permission/vi-BBqd8hl\">said</a> repeatedly, \u201cgovernments grant permits, but only communities grant permission.\u201d But as he has mouthed these words, he has pledged to build pipelines and fulfill ex-Prime Minister Stephen Harper\u2019s dream of getting fossil fuels to overseas markets. Trudeau can build LNG up, or bring down emissions: he cannot do both. Will it be on the shores of this beautiful, irreplaceable corner of the world that Trudeau\u2019s contradiction flounders?</p> <p>The signs so far are mixed. The federal government has said they\u2019ll <a href=\"http://www.vancouversun.com/technology/liberals+promise+keep+breaks/11538872/story.html?__lsa=676c-f662\">give</a> the same tax breaks to the LNG industry that Harper was prepared to. On Friday they <a href=\"http://www.nationalobserver.com/2016/03/18/news/woodfibre-lng-gets-environmental-stamp-approval-ottawa\">approved</a> a smaller but controversial LNG project in southern British Columbia. And yet the federal government is clearly feeling the heat of opposition: after tens of thousands of public comments criticizing the Petronas project, a decision that was to come down March 22 has been <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-columbia/federal-review-of-bc-lng-terminal-granted-three-month-extension/article29303688/\">delayed</a> for three months.</p> <p>The British Columbia government\u2019s response to date has been worse. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what science the forces of no bring together up there except that it\u2019s not really about the science,\u201d Premier Christy Clark declared. \u201cIt\u2019s not really about the fish. It\u2019s just about trying to say no. It\u2019s about fear of change. It\u2019s about a fear of the future.\u201d</p> <p>It must have been a complete fluke for the \u201cforces of no\u201d that the results of a study assessing the project were <a href=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/349/6248/596.1\">published</a> in Science, one of the world\u2019s premier academic journals. Its conclusion? The LNG plant <a href=\"http://www.vancouverobserver.com/news/proposed-lng-terminals-could-collapse-bc-wild-salmon-run-sfu-scientists\">could</a> lead to the collapse of BC\u2019s wild salmon run.</p> <p>It must be another coincidence that the government\u2019s own scientific studies <a href=\"http://skeenawatershed.com/resource_files/A_biological_Assessment_of_Fish_Utilization_of_the_Skeena_River_Estuary.pdf\">showed</a>, already 40 years ago, that any development in this region could \u201ccompletely destroy\u201d the river\u2019s complex ecosystem.</p> <p>And still yet another coincidence that the government\u2019s current studies continue to point out the problems with an LNG industry: its emissions, in a worse case scenario, \u201cwould be comparable to those from Alberta\u2019s oilsands.\u201d</p> <p>The provincial government\u2019s denigration has a different purpose: laying the grounds to marginalize and criminalize its Indigenous opposition. Yahaan says the RCMP who escorted Petronas workers regularly threatened community members patrolling in boats. \u201cThey said they were watching us from land, air, and water. A police sergeant told me, \u2018we could have ripped anyone out of those boats, but we didn\u2019t want to make it seem like we were protecting the corporations.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>In the face of this, support for the Lax Kw\u2019alaams has only been growing. In January, several neighbouring Indigenous nations, non-native groups and opposition politicians <a href=\"http://leludeclaration.ca/\">signed</a> onto the Lelu Declaration, a powerful call from the First Nation to protect the area from industrial development and hold it in trust for generations to come.</p> <p>Their stance is a challenge not just to Trudeau. It is a challenge to all those who choose to side with the extractive economy that offers security in the short-run but guarantees peril in the long-term. Last year, I sat in a meeting where activists from around the country debated how to propel us to the next economy. After a labour unionist pleaded for caution when it came to risking the jobs of the oil industry, an Indigenous leader named Arthur Manuel stood up. \u201cLook at the example of Lax Kw\u2019alaams,\u201d he said. \u201cWe, the poorest communities in Canada, turn down money all the time.\u201d If this First Nation can find the courage to risk another way, what excuse do the rest of us have?</p> <p>These Indigenous \u201cforces of no,\u201d derided by Christy Clark, ignored by Justin Trudeau, have taken to calling themselves by another name: the Forces of Know. Of the things they hold certain, one could not be more fundamental. It is that their approach, anchored in ancient knowledge and arched toward a habitable future, is how the world can be saved: by loving the natural world and living economies more than mere money and profit.</p> <ul> <li><em>To follow Martin on twitter: <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/Martin_Lukacs\">@Martin_Lukacs</a></em><br></li> </ul>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://vimeo.com/153284640\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/153284640\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>The Lelu Declaration pledges to prevent the construction of an LNG project at the mouth of the Skeena river.</figcaption> </figure>",

And yet the federal government is clearly feeling the heat of opposition: after tens of thousands of public comments criticizing the Petronas project, a decision that was to come down March 22 has been delayed for three months. The British Columbia government\u2019s response to date has been worse. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what science the forces of no bring together up there except that it\u2019s not really about the science,\u201d Premier Christy Clark declared. \u201cIt\u2019s not really about the fish. It\u2019s just about trying to say no. It\u2019s about fear of change. It\u2019s about a fear of the future.\u201d It must have been a complete fluke for the \u201cforces of no\u201d that the results of a study assessing the project were published in Science, one of the world\u2019s premier academic journals. Its conclusion? The LNG plant could lead to the collapse of BC\u2019s wild salmon run. It must be another coincidence that the government\u2019s own scientific studies showed, already 40 years ago, that any development in this region could \u201ccompletely destroy\u201d the river\u2019s complex ecosystem. And still yet another coincidence that the government\u2019s current studies continue to point out the problems with an LNG industry: its emissions, in a worse case scenario, \u201cwould be comparable to those from Alberta\u2019s oilsands.\u201d The provincial government\u2019s denigration has a different purpose: laying the grounds to marginalize and criminalize its Indigenous opposition. Yahaan says the RCMP who escorted Petronas workers regularly threatened community members patrolling in boats. \u201cThey said they were watching us from land, air, and water. A police sergeant told me, \u2018we could have ripped anyone out of those boats, but we didn\u2019t want to make it seem like we were protecting the corporations.\u2019\u201d In the face of this, support for the Lax Kw\u2019alaams has only been growing. In January, several neighbouring Indigenous nations, non-native groups and opposition politicians signed onto the Lelu Declaration, a powerful call from the First Nation to protect the area from industrial development and hold it in trust for generations to come. Their stance is a challenge not just to Trudeau. It is a challenge to all those who choose to side with the extractive economy that offers security in the short-run but guarantees peril in the long-term. Last year, I sat in a meeting where activists from around the country debated how to propel us to the next economy. After a labour unionist pleaded for caution when it came to risking the jobs of the oil industry, an Indigenous leader named Arthur Manuel stood up. \u201cLook at the example of Lax Kw\u2019alaams,\u201d he said. \u201cWe, the poorest communities in Canada, turn down money all the time.\u201d If this First Nation can find the courage to risk another way, what excuse do the rest of us have? These Indigenous \u201cforces of no,\u201d derided by Christy Clark, ignored by Justin Trudeau, have taken to calling themselves by another name: the Forces of Know. Of the things they hold certain, one could not be more fundamental. It is that their approach, anchored in ancient knowledge and arched toward a habitable future, is how the world can be saved: by loving the natural world and living economies more than mere money and profit.

          "bodyText": "After a volatile day, the London stock market has closed higher tonight thanks to a surge in natural resource companies. Silver produced Fresnillo, mining giant Antofagasta and commodity trading group Glencore all surged almost 10% today. They were following a pick-up in the prices of metals, thanks to the weaker dollar which remains on track for its worst day against the British pound since 2009. So the FTSE finished 25 points higher, at 6,201 points. Chris Beauchamp of IG says miners saved the day: Were it not for the mining sector, the FTSE 100 would be firmly in the red, but with commodity prices looking perkier thanks to a weaker dollar, the index has been able to hold close to its recent peak around 6200. European markets have finisher in the red, with the French CAC losing 0.5% and German DAX down almost 1%. That\u2019s partly due to alarm over the strength of the euro against the US dollar tonight. The oil price is also pushing higher, with US crude hitting a three-month high tonight. Traders will have plenty to chew on as they travel home, particularly about central banker. Last night\u2019s Fed announcements set the scene for a day in which two central banks cut interest rates (Norway and Indonesia), while two more held rates steady but issued gloomy statements (Switzerland and the UK). Can central banks really keep bailing us out? Or as Justin Trudeau point out, isn\u2019t it really time for fiscal policy to do more?..... On that note, thanks for reading and goodnight. Amid choppy trading in New York, the Dow Jones index has quietly hit its highest level of the year. The Dow is currently up 93 points, or 0.5%, at 17,418, as traders ponder the implications of the Fed\u2019s new gloomy view of the global economy and the financial markets. The pound is on track for its biggest one-day jump against the US dollar since October 2009, according to Reuters data. Sterling is currently up 1.7%, or 2.4 cents, at $1.4494 , thanks to the Fed\u2019s sudden dovishness last night. Ever felt like you\u2019re languishing in the wrong job, toiling away at the coalface as your glittering talents go to waste? Me neither. But according to the UK stats office, one in three workers are either over or under-qualified for their roles. As Katie Allen explains, it\u2019s not a great sign: In another blow to hopes that the UK can lift its productivity growth out of the doldrums, data from the Office for National Statistics shows the proportion of workers \u201cmatched\u201d to their job has dropped in recent years. At 68.7% in the three months to December 2015, the percentage of those in employment with a level of education close to the average of their job was down compared with 69.9% two years earlier. Here\u2019s the full story: Canada\u2019s prime minister Justin Trudeau, has flashed his Keynesian credentials today. Speaking to Bloomberg, the newly-ish elected leader said that Canada can\u2019t simply rely on central bankers for growth. Fiscal measures must do their bit too, Trudeau insisted, saying: \u201cWe should be using fiscal levers a little more and not just expecting monetary policy to have to fix the challenge we\u2019re in. \u201cI think we\u2019re approaching the limit of the impact of monetary policy alone.\u201d Canada\u2019s government is due to present a budget next week, and analysts expect they will lay out plans for a larger deficit. During the interview, Trudeau also diplomatically suggested he could work with Republican front-runner (and global threat-in-waiting) Donald Trump. The fall in the dollar is helping to push the oil and gold prices higher. Brent crude has gained 1.6% so far today, to $41 per barrel. As usual, there\u2019s chatter about a possible agreement to freeze output; producers are due to meet in April. Gold is also enjoying a little romp, up 0.3% to $1,266 per ounce, having surged by 3% yesterday when the Fed decision was announced. The Economist Intelligence Unit is sticking to its forecast that UK interest rates will remain at record lows for another four years. Art Cashin, a legendary figure on Wall Street, reckons the Federal Reserve is still too hawkish about monetary policy when it predicts two rate rises this year. Cashin, UBS\u2019s director of floor operations at the New York stock exchange, told CNBC that Janet Yellen will be lucky to manage one hike before Christmas. (That\u2019s a St Patrick\u2019s Day hat) The US dollar continues to be thumped today, and has shed more than 1% against other currencies. The greenback continues to suffer from last night\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting, when the Fed said it will probably only raise interest rates twice this year, not four times. It has tumbled by almost two cents against the British pound, sending sterling up to $1.4452. And the euro is almost one cent higher, at $1.1316. Christopher Vecchio, Currency Analyst at DailyFX, says traders are racing to get out of the US dollar. The US Dollar may still be the greenback, but it\u2019s green in the face now that the Fed has all but stamped out the \u201cdivergence trade\u201d that\u2019s carried the world\u2019s reserve currency for the past two years. \u201cInstead, no matter where you turn, US Dollar charts are \u2018puking\u2019 - most everyone was on one side of the trade, and now everyone is rushing for the exits at the same time.\u201d \u2018Puking\u2019, in City jargon, occurs when an asset plunges rapidly, as seen in this chart of the dollar against other currencies today South Africa has bucked the trend and raised interest rates, by a quarter-point to 7%. Worries about the global economy are likely to weigh the New York stock market when trading begins, in 30 minutes time. Reuters explains: Wall Street was set for a lower open onThursday, a day after the Federal Reserve\u2019s lowered expectations of two interest rate hikes in 2016 pushed the S&amp;P 500 to its highest close this year. The Fed, which left rates unchanged, pointed to moderateU.S. economic growth and strong job gains but cautioned about risks from an uncertain global economy. While markets across assets cheered the move, the central bank\u2019s dovish tone raised some concern about the prospects of the weakness in the global economy impacting the U.S. economy. \u201cThere\u2019s this little bit of rethinking and so, we\u2019re looking at a softer opening as some questions arise to the prospects of future growth impacting earnings,\u201d said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial in New York. And here\u2019s IG\u2019s latest opening calls: Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, believes UK interest rates will remain at record lows for at least another year. He cites weak demand in the eurozone, and weakness in the UK economy too: \u201cThe prospect of a hike in the Bank Rate remains one for the dim and distant future. The euro-zone - the UK\u2019s single largest source of imports - fell into deflation in February. Moreover, a backdrop of further falls in factory gate prices, subdued wage growth, and February seeing cuts in gas bills, also points to UK inflation rising very modestly this year. In addition, the Chancellor\u2019s Budget plans imply a slightly more severe fiscal squeeze over the next five years than previously planned, which should further caution the MPC against a tighter policy.\u201d Here\u2019s our news story about today\u2019s Bank of England announcement: Back to the Bank of England..... and today\u2019s minutes show that the MPC is concerned about the global economy. They say: Over the medium term, growth in the advanced economies should continue to be supported by the boost to real incomes from low commodity prices, and to some degree by fiscal and monetary policy. But emerging market economies are likely to grow more slowly than in recent years and the risks to the MPC\u2019s central projection of only modest global growth lie to the downside. There\u2019s drama in the financial markets -- the Bank of Japan appears to have intervened to weaken the yen. The BoJ would have been unhappy to see the yen appreciate sharply against the US dollar today, after America\u2019s Federal Reserve was so dovish last night. Financial traders are continuing to protect themselves against sterling plunging around June\u2019s referendum, the Bank of England says. Options prices continued to indicate that the price of protection against the risk of a sterling depreciation against the dollar compared with the price of protection against an appreciation was higher than in the second half of 2015. That negative skew had increased over the period since the Committee\u2019s previous meeting. However, there is \u201clittle evidence\u201d that other UK asset prices have been hurt by Brexit fears, the minutes say. The Bank of England has warned that rising Brexit uncertainty could hit economic demand in the UK. In the minutes of today\u2019s monetary policy meeting, it says that the issue has already weakened the pound. There appears to be increased uncertainty surrounding the forthcoming referendum on UK membership of the European Union. That uncertainty is likely to have been a significant driver of the decline in sterling [which has fallen by 9% since last November]. It may also delay some spending decisions and depress growth of aggregate demand in the near term. On the upside, though, the Bank believes that the underlying growth of private domestic demand remains solid. A tighter labour market and rising productivity are expected to support real incomes and consumption. Consumer confidence and most surveys of business investment are above historical averages. Breaking! Britain has entered its eighth year of record low interest rates. The Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee has voted unanimously to leave borrowing costs at their current record low of 0.5%, extending a run dating back to March 2009. The MPC also voted 9-0 to leave the Bank\u2019s quantitative easing programme unchanged, at \u00a3375bn. Details and reaction to follow.... With Donald Trump tightening his grip on the Republican nomination, the Economist Intelligence Unit has warned that President Trump would be a serious threat to the global economy. As serious, indeed, as a resurgence of jihadi terrorism destabilising the global economy. In a new report, the EIU argues that if Trump wins November\u2019s presidential election, he would trigger a trade war and incite fresh turmoil in the Middle East Brexit, Grexit, a Chinese hard-landing and fresh conflict between Russia and Eastern Europe are also significant threats, they say: New data has confirmed that the eurozone has fallen back into negative inflation. Eurostat reports that prices dropped by 0.2% across the single currency bloc in February, in line with its earlier flash estimate, and justifying the stimulus measures announced by the European Central Bank last week And there are now 11 eurozone countries in deflation, up from six in January, as cheap oil pulls down energy costs. Howard Archer IHS Global Insight says: Renewed members of the deflation club in February included Germany, France and Italy. Furthermore, Spanish deflation widened markedly to 1.0% from 0.4% in January.... He believes price pressures will remain weak for some months. The Eurozone may well edge in and out of deflation in the near term, before consumer prices gradually edge up due to reduced year-on-year drops in energy prices helped by base effects, the weak euro and ongoing Eurozone growth. Please don\u2019t get excited if you receive a message from the Bank of England governor, offering you millions of dollars. It\u2019s a fraud, despite the \u2018ID Card\u2019 offered as proof that it really, really is Mark Carney (it really isn\u2019t) The Bank of England are on the case: Joshua Mahony, Market Analyst at IG, says City traders are nervous ahead of the Bank of England\u2019s big announcement in an hour\u2019s time. While rates will surely remain at 0.5%, the minutes of this month\u2019s meeting could add to the pessimistic mood, he says. With the BoE due to release its latest monetary policy outlook, fundamental risk remains at the forefront of trader\u2019s minds, despite little likeliness of any policy shift. Given yet another OBR growth downgrade yesterday, the chances of a rate hike are slim to none, as reflected by the fact that the rates market currently sees a cut as more likely than the much vaunted hike. Indonesia just followed Norway by cutting interest rates. In its case, from 7% to 6.75%. The early optimism in the stock markets is fizzling out, following this morning\u2019s double-dose of central bank gloom. The major European indices are all now in the red, after the pessimistic statements from the Swiss and Norwegian central banks earlier today. They have reignited concerns over weak global growth, and worries that central bankers may be ill-equipped to handle it. Shares in French and German exporters are being hit, following this morning\u2019s rise in the value of the euro against the US dollar (making their goods less competitive). Erica Blomgre of Nordic corporate bank SEB says the Norwegian central bank was more pessimistic than expected today, as it lowered interest rates and predicted further cuts ahead. \u201cThe new rate path is more dovish than what market was pricing ahead of the meeting.... The main reason for the lower path is weaker private and foreign demand, lower rates abroad and lower wages and prices.\u201d Newsflash: Norway\u2019s central bank has just cut interest rates from 0.75% to 0.5%, and issued its own warning about the economic outlook. Governor \u00d8ystein Olsen says: Growth prospects for the Norwegian economy have weakened somewhat and inflation is expected to moderate further out. The Board has therefore decided to lower the key policy rate. And with wage growth weak, and unemployment expected to rise, Olsen says that rates could be cut again: \u201cThe current outlook for the Norwegian economy suggests that the key policy rate may be reduced further in the course of the year.\u201d The Nordes Bank even hints that it could even cut interest rates below zero! Should the Norwegian economy be exposed to new major shocks, the Executive Board will not exclude the possibility that the key policy rate may turn negative. More central bank action, this time in Switzerland. The Swiss National Bank has just left interest rates unchanged at minus 0.75%, and warned that the country faces deeper negative inflation too. The SNB also struck a downbeat tone, saying: The global economic outlook has deteriorated slightly in recent months and the situation on international financial markets remains volatile. The Fed\u2019s sudden dovishness could yet backfire if they are caught out by US inflation pressures, says Jan Von Gerich of Nordea Markets. Mike van Dulken and Augustin Eden at Accendo Markets reckon that the Federal Reserve might not raise interest rates at all this year. They suspect that the looming US election could help keep borrowing costs on hold through 2016 (even though policymakers expect two rate hikes). The Fed chair cited global risks to the US economy and inflation uncertainty, rather than the US economy itself which is performing well, as reasons for a) standing pat in March and b) just maybe standing pat for the rest of the year. We still think (b) is the most likely outcome given what\u2019s on the menu in the US in the latter half of 2016 (i.e. a presidential election the build-up to which is proving even more of a circus than usual), not to mention that the FOMC needs to keep market sentiment in check. The dollar is continuing to weaken this morning, driving the euro up to a five-week high of $1.1279. The pound has also risen against the US dollar, to $1.429. Brexit fears are taking a back seat today. And India\u2019s rupee has also strengthened: Mining companies are leading the rally in London this morning, with Anglo American surging by almost 10%. They are benefitting from the slump in the US dollar, after the Fed said it only expects two interest rate hikes this year, not four. A weaker US currency pushes up the cost of commodities (as they are priced in dollars), and should also prevent capital from pouring out of emerging markets into US assets. Shares are rallying in Europe, and across Asia, after the US Federal Reserve was surprisingly dovish at last night\u2019s policy meeting. America\u2019s central bank tore up its previous forecasts for four interest rate rises this year, and now expects to only hike American borrowing costs twice in 2016. That\u2019s a recognition that inflationary pressures are rather weaker than policymakers previously realised. The Fed struck a somewhat downbeat tone, given it had hiked borrowing costs back in December, cautioning that \u201cglobal economic and financial developments continue to pose risks\u201d. And chair Janet Yellen was at pains to insists that monetary wasn\u2019t on a pre-set course, and that \u201ccaution\u201d was needed. This dovish approach to rate hikes was cheered on Wall Street, and Asian markets followed suit. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite index has closed 1.2% higher, and Australia gained almost 1%. And in London, the FTSE 100 has gained 33 points in early trading to 6210 points. Investors are calculating that the era of ultra-easy monetary policy could be with us for longer than expected, with Japan and the eurozone now operating negative interest rates and British borrowing costs likely to stay low for many years. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain\u2019s era of record low interest rates will continue into its eighth year today, as the Bank of England meets to set monetary policy. In a busy period for central bankers, it\u2019s the BoE\u2019s turn to consider how to tackle the weak growth and low inflation that is bedevilling the global economy. At noon today the monetary policy committee will announce their decisions, and almost certainly leave interest rates at 0.5%. The minutes of the meeting will be more interesting, showing how worried policymakers are the global economy, the recent turbulence in the financial markets, and even the upcoming EU referendum. And there\u2019s always the possibility that one, or more, of the nine MPC members will vote to change monetary policy today. It\u2019s unlikely, though, as Jasper Lawler of CMC Market explains: Expectations are for another 0-0-9 vote to keep interest rates unchanged. It\u2019s hard to imagine accompanying BOE meeting minutes turning more hawkish before the June Brexit vote given Governor Mark Carney\u2019s warnings about the risks of uncertainty. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

I\u2019ve always been aware of homelessness in this country, it\u2019s always been my kind of cause. The fact that we have homeless veterans people who go out and defend the country then come back and live on the streets, that to me is a problem.</p> <p>\u201cI would prefer to feel a little more enthusiastic about who I\u2019m voting for, I think I\u2019m just kind of exhausted with this whole fiasco. But Hillary brings Bill, and they\u2019d make a good partnership. Bill Clinton was a good president, when he was there our economy was really quite good. He got along with Congress, he could collaborate and work with them, and the fact he has some input would be a greater comfort to me than anything. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t like Hillary, it\u2019s just that she comes with war wounds and scars that I\u2019d prefer her not to have, but at least she comes armed.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56e83f75e4b00ee214c7b331\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/mona-chalabi\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-03-15T20:36:04.263Z\">8.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">What to expect in Missouri</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/elections/us-locator-maps/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2016/elections/us-locator-maps/boot.js\" data-alt=\"type:state; states:missouri\"> </figure>  <p><strong>Primaries: </strong>Republican and Democratic presidential primaries</p> <p><strong>Delegates: </strong><a href=\"https://gop.com/2016-gophq/event_schedule/?schedule_type=primary\">52</a> Republican delegates, <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Democratic_National_Convention,_2016\">84</a> Democratic delegates</p> <p><strong>Things to watch out for:</strong> Although Missouri is holding Republican and Democratic primaries, the results of the Republican vote will not be binding \u2013 as was <a href=\"http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/news-columns-blogs/the-buzz/article35194227.html\">also the case in 2012</a>, when Rick Santorum won here.

Today marks the beginning of the crucial <strong>winner-takes-all primaries</strong> for the Republican candidates,<strong> </strong>wherein in the delegate-rich states of <strong>Florida</strong> and <strong>Ohio</strong> will allocate their delegates not proportionally, but entirely to the winner of a plurality of the state\u2019s vote. (Not every Republican primary that occurs today or hereafter will be winner-takes-all, however \u2013 there will also be primary contests today in <strong>Illinois, Missouri, North Carolina</strong> and the <strong>Northern Mariana Islands</strong>, a commonwealth in the Pacific Ocean.)</p> <p><strong>Let\u2019s take a look at these contests:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Northern Mariana Islands</strong><strong>: </strong>The least-populated area controlled by the United States, this commonwealth has already decided the victors in its primary. Having voted in favor of <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> in the Democratic primary on Saturday, today the commonwealth\u2019s Republican voters supported billionaire Republican frontrunner <strong>Donald Trump</strong>, who took home 73% of the commonwealth\u2019s vote and has won <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Jmrhosborne/status/709696836337065984\">all nine of its delegates</a>. The governor of the Northern Mariana Islands had endorsed Trump last week.</li> <li><strong>Florida: </strong>Polling averages show the Sunshine State going for Trump by a nearly 20-point margin, and former secretary of state Clinton by a nearly 30-point margin. With heavy early voting that has already shattered records, previous poll trends bolster both of those candidacies. That\u2019s bad news for native son <strong>Marco Rubio</strong>, who has won only a single primary actually held in a US state. He has a mean, hungry look. On the Democratic side, a silver lining for Vermont senator <strong>Bernie Sanders</strong>: unlike in the Republican primary, Florida\u2019s delegates are assigned proportionately in the Democratic race, which means he won\u2019t be entirely shut out even in the event of a South Carolina-like landslide for Clinton.</li> <li><strong>Ohio: </strong>We come to praise Rubio, not to bury him. The Florida senator\u2019s declaration that his supporters in Ohio who cared most about stopping Trump\u2019s ascent to the party\u2019s nomination should instead cast their vote for the Buckeye State\u2019s sitting governor, <strong>John Kasich</strong>, has led to a collapse in Rubio\u2019s polling numbers in the state, and coincided with a Kasich upswing that has him narrowly beating Trump in polling averages. Clinton is seen as a favorite here, but the potential for an upset in favor of Sanders in this anti-Nafta Rust Belt state is helping the senator\u2019s fans feel the Bern.</li> <li><strong>Illinois: </strong>Seen in polling as another delegate-rich site of yet another Trump victory, Illinois is more interesting on the Democratic side, where some are predicting a Sanders upset.

          "bodyText": "Hello! We\u2019ve got a new election-night-results blog up and running over here. Please join us! With primary voting now under way in Illinois, airplanes have taken flight above the Chicago skyline displaying banners stating: \u201cChicago Stands with Laquan, Hillary Stands with Rahm,\u201d as activists seek to hurt Hillary Clinton in her home state\u2019s polls by connecting her to the death of Laquan McDonald. \u201cTell me who you know, and I\u2019ll tell you who you are,\u201d said Tess Raser, an organizer with Assata\u2019s Daughters, the group coordinating today\u2019s banner actions, said before the planes took flight. \u201cTo this day, Hillary Clinton has yet to condemn Chicago\u2019s anti-black mayor.\u201d Since the release of the footage showing McDonald being shot 16-times by a veteran white cop, the city has found itself at the epicentre of debates on police violence while also facing a federal investigation into the practices of their police department. In the wake of so much attention, activists have declared the city\u2019s mayor - and any politician that does not denounce him - as responsible for the mishandling of the McDonald case and the police department they see as far too brutal, and also an enemy to their movement to end police brutality. \u201cAny politician who supports Emanuel should consider themselves implicated in his misconduct,\u201d Raser continued, pointing to Clinton voicing confidence in the mayor last December. \u201cAnti-black politicians are not welcome in Chicago whether they are running for state\u2019s attorney or president of the United States.\u201d Today\u2019s aerial demonstration also hopes to unseat current state\u2019s attorney Anita Alvarez, who is up for reelection, for her role in the handling of the McDonald case as well. On Saturday, senator Bernie Sanders deployed a similar tactic of aligning Clinton with Emanuel - Barack Obama\u2019s former chief of staff - while speaking at a press conference in Chicago where he thanked the city\u2019s mayor for choosing not to endorse him. \u201cBased on his disastrous record as mayor of the city of Chicago, I do not want Mayor Emanuel\u2019s endorsement if I win the Democratic nomination,\u201d Sanders said, noting that Clinton \u201cproudly\u201d lists Emanuel as a supporter. The Franklin Township Fire Department polling station is surrounded by farms in the north part of Richland County, Ohio \u2013 about halfway in between Columbus and Cleveland. They were doing a brisk business at 4:00pm today, and polling workers said that there had been a line (albeit a short one) all day. Voters were queueing up to use a new identification system \u2013 the PollPad \u2013 which scanned the magnetic strip on their drivers licenses or state-issued IDs before heading over to the electronic voting machines to cast their ballots. Outside, Teresa Fitch and her son Terry said that they\u2019d voted for Ted Cruz. \u201cHe was the best choice,\u201d Teresa, an elementary school teacher, explained. \u201cTrump has switched parties so many times, who knows what he\u2019d do. And governor Kasich has a track record with teachers,\u201d she said, referring to an anti-union effort in his first term. \u201cHe tried to mess with us once, I\u2019ll bet not one teacher votes for him. And maybe not a firefighter or a police officer either.\u201d Vox Pop: the transport worker who reasons \u2018Hillary brings Bill\u2019 Name: Lisa Hastye Age: 54 Location: Fort Lauderdale, Florida Occupation: Federal government transportation worker Voted for: Hillary Clinton (reluctantly) \u201cMy biggest issue is keeping the economy going. The economy is linked to way of life. We live in a country that I\u2019m so proud of being in but I have a problem with the fact we have people who are homeless, who don\u2019t have enough food to eat, who don\u2019t have a quality of life that is acceptable, while there are some that have so much. I\u2019ve always been aware of homelessness in this country, it\u2019s always been my kind of cause. The fact that we have homeless veterans people who go out and defend the country then come back and live on the streets, that to me is a problem. \u201cI would prefer to feel a little more enthusiastic about who I\u2019m voting for, I think I\u2019m just kind of exhausted with this whole fiasco. But Hillary brings Bill, and they\u2019d make a good partnership. Bill Clinton was a good president, when he was there our economy was really quite good. He got along with Congress, he could collaborate and work with them, and the fact he has some input would be a greater comfort to me than anything. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t like Hillary, it\u2019s just that she comes with war wounds and scars that I\u2019d prefer her not to have, but at least she comes armed.\u201d Primaries: Republican and Democratic presidential primaries Delegates: 52 Republican delegates, 84 Democratic delegates Things to watch out for: Although Missouri is holding Republican and Democratic primaries, the results of the Republican vote will not be binding \u2013 as was also the case in 2012, when Rick Santorum won here. Last September, the Missouri Republican state committee announced the rules governing this year\u2019s Republican primary: if a candidate wins an absolute majority of votes (anything more than 50%), Missouri will be a winner-take-all state; if not, the candidate with the highest vote share in each congressional district would get five delegates, and the leading candidate statewide would be awarded nine delegates. The remaining three delegates would be unbound, much like Democratic superdelegates. In terms of outcomes, predicting the results in Missouri is pretty much guesswork. Just two Democratic polls have been conducted there this year, and only one poll has asked Republican voters who they prefer \u2013 those surveys have suggested Sanders and Clinton are neck-and-neck while Trump is ahead of the Republican field. But they simply aren\u2019t a reliable indication of voter preferences in Missouri. Demographics: The electorate in Missouri is whiter with a slightly lower median household income than national averages. Officials currently expect around 34% of registered voters to show up and cast a ballot in Tuesday\u2019s primary \u2013 although this varies considerably throughout the state, from a projected low of 7% turnout in Washington County to a high of 74% in Caldwell County. The voting precinct at the Mount Vernon Ave AME Church Outreach Center in Columbus, Ohio, was quiet, as elderly neighborhood residents trickled in and out of a rear door by a small parking lot, helped to the site by a community shuttle servicing elderly and disabled residents. Out front, an older man walked down Mount Vernon Avenue shouting \u201cGet over it!\u201d over and over as he walked past without stopping. But precinct workers were jittery as I tried to talk to voters. \u201cThis is an important election, and I want the voice of the people to be heard,\u201d one said, while asking me to leave. \u201cThey\u2019ll do anything to try to shut us down,\u201d she added, asking not to be identified. Outside, Chuck Minter, 81, was unperturbed and happy to have voted for Hillary Clinton. \u201cI\u2019ve been voting for 60 years\u201d, he said, noting that, in his youth, the voting age was 21. \u201cIn those 60 years, I\u2019ve only missed voting one time in any kind of election.\u201d \u201cThat one was a primary, and the time just passed me by,\u201d he said with a hint of regret. Vox Pop: The retiree who\u2019s never missed an election Name: Chuck Minter Age: 81 Location: Columbus, OH Occupation: Retired Voted for: Hillary Clinton \u201cMy most important issue is everyone having equal rights. Hillary\u2019s a good Democrat and she\u2019s always stood for those kinds of principles... I\u2019ve been voting for 60 years. In those 60 years, I\u2019ve only missed voting one time in any election. That one was a primary, and time just passed me by.\u201d Vox Pop: The millennial voting for Cruz to damage Trump Name: Alexander Manning Age: 21 Location: Miami Beach, Florida Voted For: Ted Cruz \u201cThe discrepancy between the top one percent and the rest of the country. It\u2019s corrupting our whole political system, the media and everything else. The one percent control the media, and the media\u2019s controlling everyone else. It\u2019s big problem for me. I\u2019m a registered Republican so I\u2019m going to vote for Cruz to try to keep Trump out. In the election I\u2019ll vote for Hillary or Bernie. But the wealth problem is such a massive issue. It\u2019s hard to know what to do about it.\u201d Primaries: Republican and Democratic presidential primaries Delegates: 72 Republican delegates, 121 Democratic delegates Things to watch out for: Polls currently show Clinton leading steadily here and, to a lesser extent, Trump too. Again, vote shares matter, including for Republicans \u2013 this is the only state where there\u2019s no minimum threshold to get delegates. The GOP simply assigns them in proportion to votes received at the primary. Results in North Carolina could be surprising \u2013 Trump\u2019s lead here has varied in recent polls from just 9 points to as much as 20. Demographics: One in five voting-age residents of North Carolina are black (nationally that figure is one in eight). That might work against Sanders, who has struggled to appeal to black voters according to some exit polls. Voter turnout was 35% in 2012 and and 37% in 2008. So far, Republicans have seen growth in primary turnout while the opposite is true for Democrats. (There have been some exceptions \u2013 in Michigan, where Sanders won big last week, almost twice as many voters showed up as in 2008.) High turnout may work in Sanders\u2019 favour on 15 March At a unity luncheon at the Capitol, Barack Obama told members of Congress that he has been disturbed by \u2018\u2018vulgar and divisive rhetoric\u2019\u2019 of the 2016 presidential campaign thus far, a not-so-subtle dig at Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump. \u201cI know that I\u2019m not the only one in this room who may be more than a little dismayed about what\u2019s happening on the campaign trail lately,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWe have heard vulgar and divisive rhetoric aimed at women and minorities - at Americans who don\u2019t look like \u2018us,\u2019 or pray like \u2018us,\u2019 or vote like we do. We\u2019ve seen misguided attempts to shut down that speech, however offensive it may be.\u201d \u201cIn response to those attempts, we\u2019ve seen actual violence, and we\u2019ve heard silence from too many of our leaders,\u201d he continued. \u201cSpeaker Ryan, I appreciated the words on this topic that you shared with us this morning. But too often we\u2019ve accepted this as somehow the new normal.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s worth asking ourselves what each of us may have done to contribute to this kind of vicious atmosphere in our politics. I suspect that all of us can recall some intemperate words that we regret. Certainly, I can,\u201d Obama said. \u201cAnd while some may be more to blame than others for the current climate, all of us are responsible for reversing it. For it is a cycle that is not an accurate reflection of America. And it has to stop. And I say that not because it\u2019s a matter of \u2018political correctness,\u2019 it\u2019s about the way that corrosive behavior can undermine our democracy, and our society, and even our economy.\u201d \u201cIn America, there aren\u2019t laws that say that we have to be nice to each other, or courteous, or treat each other with respect. But there are norms. There are customs. There are values that our parents taught us and that we try to teach to our children - to try to treat others the way we want to be treated; the notion that kindness breeds kindness. The longer that we allow the political rhetoric of late to continue, and the longer that we tacitly accept it, we create a permission structure that allows the animosity in one corner of our politics to infect our broader society. And animosity breeds animosity.\u201d \u201cAnd this is also about the American brand. Who are we? How are we perceived around the world? There\u2019s a reason that America has always attracted the greatest talent from every corner of the globe. There\u2019s a reason that \u2018Made in America\u2019 means something. It\u2019s because we\u2019re creative, and dynamic, and diverse, and inclusive, and open. Why would we want to see that brand tarnished?\u201d Primaries: Republican and Democratic presidential primaries Delegates: 69 Republican delegates, 182 Democratic delegates Things to watch out for: Illinois is a crucial state in the Democratic race. Polling averages currently show that Clinton is ahead of Sanders by just 2 percentage points. But there\u2019s a significant margin of error on those numbers, given that they\u2019re based on just three polls prior to which Clinton was easily leading in the double digits. If polling turns out to be as flawed here as it was in Michigan last week, Sanders\u2019 climb to the White House might not be so uphill after all. There\u2019s also a lack of good polling data among Republicans that live here \u2013 only six polls have been conducted here so far this year, but all show Trump with a small but steady lead on other candidates. Demographics: The profile of Illinois\u2019 electorate is almost identical to the US national average. And voter concerns are similar to those expressed nationally too \u2013 a CBS/You Gov poll of 1,681 registered voters in Illinois that was conducted from 9-11 March found that 74% of respondents felt the economy in their state was doing badly. Half of Republican voters in the poll said they felt that trade with other countries takes away US jobs \u2013 a message that has been a key part of Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. Vox Pop: The social worker voting for Hillary Clinton Name: Nancy Zemina Age: 64 Location: Lake Worth, Florida Occupation: Social worker, retired Voted for: Hillary Clinton Issue that matters most: Health care \u201cBefore Obama took office, there were [45+] million uninsured people and that number has been halved, or more than halved, with Obamacare.I find the fact that Republicans have tried 40 times to get rid of Obamacare ridiculous. And I think for Republican candidates to promise to repeal Obamacare without offering a plan to replace it is a crime against their constituents. I feel very passionately about this.\u201d Zemina said she\u2019s confounded why working class Americans would cast their vote for a Republican candidate. \u201cRepublicans are appealing to people who\u2019ve had the wool pulled over their eyes. If they could just see through the rhetoric, they [Republican voters] would realize they\u2019re voting against their own interest. But some people are just angry and they direct it at Obama. But really, if Republicans hadn\u2019t blocked everything Obama tried to do they would have many more services.\u201d Zemina is hopeful that Clinton will be able to bridge the partisan divide and work with Republicans to follow through on her agenda. \u201cHer husband was very successful, being the consummate politician, and working with everyone to pass his agenda. I hope she can do the same.\u201d Primaries: Republican and Democratic presidential primaries Delegates: 66 Republican delegates, 159 Democratic delegates Things to watch out for: This is the only state to vote on 15 March where Trump is not polling ahead of other candidates \u2013 John Kasich, who is the governor of Ohio, is 3 points ahead of him. That might not sound like much, but Ohio is a winner-takes-all state with 66 GOP delegates available. A win for Kasich wouldn\u2019t give him any real chance of securing the nomination, but for Republicans, the strategy at this point may be simply about trying to erode Trump\u2019s delegate numbers as much as possible (at least according to Rubio adviser Alex Conant). If Kasich loses, he will almost certainly drop out of the race. Clinton\u2019s lead here has eroded in recent weeks from double digits to an average lead of 8 percentage points. This is yet another state where Sanders might surpass expectations \u2013 particularly given the state\u2019s demographics. Demographics: Ohio\u2019s electorate is whiter and has a slightly lower median household income than the US median ($49,000 compared to $54,000). A poll from Quinnipiac University earlier this month found that gender could play a big role in Ohio\u2019s primary for both parties. The results showed that men back Trump over Kasich 40%-33% while women choose Kasich 44%-37%. Among Democrats, the gaps were even larger with women backing Clinton over Sanders 56%-39% and men choosing Sanders 55%-43%. As ever, it\u2019s not just overall turnout numbers that matter, but more specifically which voters show up. Ohio governor John Kasich has spent the last week making two basic pitches to voters in his home state, as he fights for the future of his presidential campaign ahead of Tuesday\u2019s make-or-break primary in Ohio, reports the Guardian\u2019s Megan Carpentier. His first pitch \u2013 much like Hillary Clinton\u2019s, actually \u2013 is that he has experience in getting things done in Washington (from his eight terms in Congress and his five terms atop the House budget committee) and as the leader of an executive branch (his one-and-a-half terms as governor of the swing state of Ohio). His policies aren\u2019t theoretical solutions; his efficacy won\u2019t be based on how well Congress takes to being coerced (which is never well). His second pitch is that, unlike his opponents, he\u2019s a decent human being. Vox Pop: The pro-Hillary Miami matron Name: Rose McVeigh Age: 58 Location: Miami Beach, Florida Voted for: Hillary Clinton \u201cThe biggest problem in this country is income inequality and the top one percent. We haven\u2019t had a significant wage increase in fifteen years. I would like to vote for Bernie Sanders but I don\u2019t think this country is ready for a candidate like that. Hillary and Bernie share a lot the values I believe in - human rights, women\u2019s rights, religious tolerance. The polar opposite of Donald Trump.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t have a problem with Hillary being in the top one percent - this country is based on capitalism. Shes done an incredible work helping civil rights and healthcare, even though they\u2019re not where they need to be. She\u2019s highly qualified, the one who can bring us together, and she\u2019s been fighting her entire life to be right where she is today. She deserves it.\u201d Primaries: Republican and Democratic presidential primaries Delegates: 99 Republican delegates, 246 Democratic delegates Things to watch out for: For Republicans, this is the most important state to vote on 15 March. If Senator Rubio were going to win big anywhere, it probably would be here, in his home state. However, polling averages show that Donald Trump has consistently been in first place for voters since September and is leading by 19 points in this winner-takes-all state. Clinton, too, has had a clear lead in Florida for months \u2013 so far this month, polls have suggested she is 30 points ahead of Sanders. Remember though, unlike the Republican race, the exact vote share matters for Democrats since this affects how delegates are distributed. Sanders doesn\u2019t need to win Florida, he needs only to erode Clinton\u2019s lead here and collect around 100 of the pledged delegates that are available. Demographics: Of the 15.9 million Floridians who are of voting age, 12 million are currently registered to vote. The electorate is slightly older and more likely to be Hispanic than the national voting profile. A poll from Monmouth earlier this month found that 35% of Republicans don\u2019t approve of the way that Rubio is handling his job as senator and just 7% were undecided about who they would vote for. The first sneak peek of Hillary Clinton\u2019s appearance on Comedy Central\u2019s Broad City has been released online: The takeaway: Clinton can blink with both eyes! Vox Pop: The Ohio State student supporting Bernie Sanders Name: Ryan Antone Age: 22 Location: Columbus, Ohio Occupation: Ohio State University student Voted for: Bernie Sanders \u201cMy biggest issue right now is how this college system is structured, not to be a cliche. We take out all these loans because we think that this major will pay off in the future, but I\u2019m already just bogged down in debt. Maybe Bernie won\u2019t achieve full tuition-free college, but that\u2019s not why I voted for him. I love Bernie because he has that sense that we can do more, we don\u2019t have to settle. I think Hillary Clinton would be a great candidate but she\u2019s said, \u2018I\u2019m the one who can get things done.\u2019 Well, I don\u2019t like the system as it is. Why can\u2019t we try?\u201d Republican presidential candidate John Kasich cast his vote in the state primary on Tuesday, confirming to the gathered press afterward that he had selected his own name on the ballot. He told reporters that he wasn\u2019t going to let frontrunner Donald Trump \u201cruin\u201d his day, and went on to comment on the way the reality star has been running his campaign, saying he hoped someone would \u201cpull [him] aside\u201d if he ever got \u201cout of control\u201d in the same way. The Guardian\u2019s Megan Carpentier is having a hard time finding polling places in Ohio... The polling place at Ohio State University\u2019s Newman Center - a Catholic community center on campus - was quiet during lunch hour, as just a handful of students trickled in to cast their ballots. \u201cIt\u2019s student break,\u201d a poll worker explained. \u201cBut we got a lot of notification of early voters\u201d when they received the rolls. The polling place on the western-most corner of OSU\u2019s enormous Columbus, Ohio campus wasn\u2019t easy to find, though: The entrance is on a side street, through a door at the end of the parking lot with only a letter-sized piece of paper reading \u201cVOTING HERE\u201d affixed to the window. In the midwest, Sanders and Clinton are peddling very different visions of America, report the Guardian\u2019s Dan Roberts and Lauren Gambino. In a fight for blue-collar votes, Clinton hails Obama\u2019s legacy, but her rival condemns a \u201crigged economy\u201d that rewards the rich. Despite spending days crisscrossing the same midwest battlegrounds in search of votes that could decide the Democratic primary once and for all, Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton enter Tuesday\u2019s rustbelt showdown with two very different visions of the region\u2019s economic fortunes. In keeping with a \u201cglass half full\u201d view of America, the former secretary of state is keen to stress the progress made under the current administration, particularly in reducing unemployment since the financial crisis. \u201cI don\u2019t think President Obama gets the credit he deserves for getting us back,\u201d she told a union hall in Illinois on Monday. Sanders, meanwhile, has doubled down on his thesis that Americans are still labouring under a \u201crigged economy\u201d, telling a rival crowd in Ohio that the country is literally \u201cfalling apart\u201d due to crumbling infrastructure and a corrupt campaign finance system. Donald Trump\u2019s surge to frontrunner status in the Republican presidential race has caused angst and divisions among the donor network led by the billionaire Koch brothers, some of whom pushed to launch a sustained anti-Trump drive and were rebuffed, reports the Guardian\u2019s Peter Stone: \u201cI\u2019m extremely disappointed about the Koch network being off the playing field,\u201d Randy Kendrick, a leading Koch donor from Arizona, told the Guardian about the absence of anti-Trump efforts. \u201cThis country does not believe in rule by strongmen or cult personality figures.\u201d After pushing for a Koch network blitz against Trump, the conservative network\u2019s top political operative, Marc Short, left last month to advise the Rubio campaign and consult for several Senate and gubernatorial candidates, some of whom are likely to get Koch network backing too, say two GOP sources. While the Koch network\u2019s leadership opted not to attack Trump \u2013 due to divisions over alternative candidates, fears an attack would backfire and wariness about getting involved in the election at the primary stage \u2013 some of its individual donors have plowed over $4m into the anti-Trump Super Pac Our Principles, including the Ricketts family, which owns the Chicago Cubs; hedge fund mogul Paul Singer; Randy Kendrick, whose husband Ken is an Arizona Diamondbacks co-owner; and billionaire Stan Hubbard. If Donald Trump wins both Ohio and Florida, he would have a stranglehold on the nomination \u2013 but any other outcome leaves open the possibility of a contested convention, report the Guardian\u2019s David Smith, Megan Carpentier and Ben Jacobs: Republicans go to the polls in five states today facing a stark choice between Donald Trump and a protracted race that could descend into chaos and, some fear, potential violence. On a critical day for the party\u2019s future, Trump could virtually lock up the nomination if he wins the delegate-rich states of Florida and Ohio, probably eliminating rivals Marco Rubio and John Kasich in the process. But if the New York billionaire falls short, he could face an uphill struggle in the remaining primaries to clinch the 1,237 delegates needed for an outright win, raising the spectre of a contested Republican convention in July. Even if Trump goes to the convention with the most delegates, the Republican establishment could mount a rearguard action to snatch the nomination from him. One-in-four Americans would consider leaving the United States if billionaire Republican frontrunner Donald Trump were elected president, according to a poll from Morning Consult/Vox poll released today. Twenty-eight percent of those surveyed said that they would likely consider leaving (fleeing?) the US if Trump were elected, while 65% said that they would remain. Of those who said that they would be open to leaving, more than half said they are \u201cvery likely\u201d to consider moving. There\u2019s a predictable party-line split among those willing to explore moving to Canada: 49 percent of self-described liberals said they\u2019d consider leaving the US if Trump were elected, while only 12% of conservatives said so. Justin Trudeau, prime minister of Canada, seems open to the idea of welcoming would-be citizens from Canada\u2019s southern neighbor. At a Huffington Post town hall, Trudeau floated the possibility of an island off Canada\u2019s Atlantic coast as a potential home for American expatriates. \u201cThe fact is Cape Breton is lovely, all times of the year,\u201d Trudeau said. \u201cIf people do want to make choices that perhaps suit their lifestyles better, Canada\u2019s always welcoming!\u201d Brief, though not-earth shattering, quotes on Vermont senator Bernie Sanders\u2019 election prospects: Bernie Sanders arrived for breakfast at Lou Mitchell\u2019s, a Chicago institution ten minutes drive from his hotel. A few shouts of recognition punctuated his arrival - \u201cway to go Bernie\u201d, \u201clooking tired Bernie\u201d - but otherwise he made as low-key an entrance as anyone can make into a diner with a half dozen cameras and a security detail. In keeping with tradition, he briefly shook a few hands but did not get into prolonged conversation with anyone except table companions Chuy Garc\u00eda and his wife Evelyn, before tucking into what looked like an omelette. Donna More, who is running for Cook County state attorney, was conveniently eating at a nearby table and came over to say hi but was enlisted into taking a photo with the restaurant\u2019s owner. One supporter, Yvonne Oby, got a hug. Several more got selfies. Asked by your pooler how he was feeling about tonight, Sanders said \u201cI\u2019ll tell you in a few hours\u201d. Is he worried about former secretary of state Hillary Clinton piling on the delegates, even if he wins the Midwest? \u201cI think that if there is a large voter turnout, we are going to do just great here in Illinois, in Missouri, Ohio, and hopefully North Carolina and Florida. In the states that are coming down the pike, we have great opportunities to win many of them, so we are feeling really good.\u201d Eric Trump, son of Donald Trump, is lambasting Ohio governor John Kasich\u2019s chances at seizing the Republican presidential nomination. The younger Trump, a graduate of Georgetown University with a degree in finance, might want to check his math. There are 1,401 available delegates remaining in the Republican presidential primary, and Kasich already has 63 delegates to his name, which means that Kasich would have to win 83% of the remaining delegates to claim the party\u2019s nomination. That is by no means easy, but also by no means \u201cstatistically impossible.\u201d Spotted in Ohio: Donald Trump briefly faced the threat of criminal charges on Monday night, as efforts grew across the political spectrum to check his increasingly violent rise on the eve of key US primary elections, reports the Guardian\u2019s Dan Roberts. Police in North Carolina were reportedly investigating whether the Republican frontrunner should be prosecuted for incitement after an African American protester was hit in the face as he was escorted out of a rally in Fayetteville last week. Trump has previously said he would like to punch protesters \u201cin the face\u201dhimself, expressing nostalgia for a time when those causing disruption would be \u201ccarried out on a stretcher\u201d. In common with other recent incidents, he offered to pay the legal fees of the assailant involved on Thursday. A Cumberland county sheriff spokesman said late on Monday that they would not charge Trump over the incident. Ohio governor John Kasich hast cast his vote in the Buckeye State\u2019s Republican primary. Any guesses who he pulled the lever for? The latest ad against billionaire Republican frontrunner Donald Trump uses the often-vulgar candidate\u2019s own words against him. The ad, created by Our Principles PAC, a super pac attempting to prevent Trump\u2019s ascendance to the Republican presidential nomination by any means necessary, features women reading Trump\u2019s most bombastic and offensive quotations aloud. \u201cBimbo,\u201d \u201cdog,\u201d \u201cfat pig,\u201d the litany of insults begins. \u201cWomen: You have to treat \u2018em like shit,\u201d one woman quotes. \u201cYou know, it really doesn\u2019t matter what they write, as long as you\u2019ve got a young and beautiful piece of ass,\u201d says another. \u201cI like kids! I mean, I won\u2019t do anything to take care of them - I\u2019ll supply funds, and she\u2019ll take care of the kids,\u201d another says. \u201cShe had the height; she had the beauty. She was crazy, but these are minor details,\u201d one woman quotes, as a chyron explains that Trump was talking about the late Diana, Princess of Wales. \u201cIf you believe America deserves better, vote against Donald Trump,\u201d the ad says at its conclusion. The hacking collective Anonymous has vowed once again to \u201cdismantle\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and to \u201cexpose what he doesn\u2019t want the public to know\u201d. The group announced its re-engagement of \u201cOpTrump\u201d through its traditional propaganda video, aiming to take down one of Trump\u2019s property websites for Chicago on 1 April. Anonymous said: \u201cWe have been watching you for a long time and what we\u2019ve seen is deeply disturbing. You don\u2019t stand for anything but your personal greed and power. \u201cThis is a call to arms. Shut down his websites, research and expose what he doesn\u2019t want the public to know. We need you to dismantle his campaign and sabotage his brand.\u201d Anonymous last declared war on Trump at the end of 2015 in response to Trump\u2019s proposal to ban Muslims from entering the US. At the time the group took down the website of New York\u2019s Trump Tower using a distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) that overwhelms a site\u2019s servers using bogus traffic. Whether this renewed effort by Anonymous will have a greater impact on Trump and his campaign for the US presidential elections is unclear. But the collective is urging everyone to support their campaign saying \u201cyou do not need to know how to hack to support this operation\u201d. \u201cThis is a declaration of total war. OperationTrump engaged.\u201d Trump has been the target of several hacking groups, allegedly leaking personal information, voicemail messages and attacking his various sites, all of which have had little effect on his popularity. What time is the Super Bowl primary over? Here\u2019s a handy timeline for when we\u2019re anticipating polls to close in Super-er Tuesday tonight: Northern Mariana Islands: The polls are already closed! Donald Trump won. Florida, Part I: Most polls in the Sunshine State close at 7 pm EDT, but the western panhandle will have polls open until 8 pm EDT. North Carolina, Ohio: The first statewide polls will close at 7:30 pm EDT in North Carolina and Ohio. In North Carolina, which has shattered previous records in absentee votes, nearly half of its total ballots could be counted by 8 pm tonight - expect an early-ish call there in both the Democratic and Republican primaries. Ohio, too, has been above-pace for absentee and early-voting ballots, which could mean a similarly quick count. Florida, Part II, Illinois, Missouri: Polls will close in Illinois and Missouri, as well as in the Florida panhandle, at 8 pm EDT. Florida will be called earlier, since the ballot-counting process in the most populous parts of the state will have been going on for an hour; Illinois and Missouri will be on the later side. A bombshell report from Politico paints a more-than-unflattering portrait of Corey Lewandowski, campaign manager for Donald Trump and accused assailant in a criminal complaint filed by a female campaign journalist. According to more than 20 sources, Lewandowski has faced complaints ranging from physical aggression with other reporters to being \u201csexually suggestive\u201d with female journalists. One anecdote: When he was working with the Koch Bros.-funded Americans for Prosperity super PAC, Lewandowski reportedly berated a female employee in public, using a very particular word for the female anatomy. Lewandowski has been accused by Michelle Fields, a now-former reporter for the conservative Breitbart News, of aggressively pulling her from proximity to the candidate, to the point where she says he left bruises on her arms. Fields\u2019 account has been backed up by another reporter at the scene, audio of the exchange and even video. Trump continues to stand by his campaign manager, even though opponents Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz have declared that they would have fired their campaign managers for similar behavior. Beware the Ides of March Two weeks after the so-called Super Tuesday primaries proved to be a lot less decisive in determining the presidential nominee for either of the major political parties, the day we have dubbed Super-er Tuesday is finally here. Today marks the beginning of the crucial winner-takes-all primaries for the Republican candidates, wherein in the delegate-rich states of Florida and Ohio will allocate their delegates not proportionally, but entirely to the winner of a plurality of the state\u2019s vote. (Not every Republican primary that occurs today or hereafter will be winner-takes-all, however \u2013 there will also be primary contests today in Illinois, Missouri, North Carolina and the Northern Mariana Islands, a commonwealth in the Pacific Ocean.) Let\u2019s take a look at these contests: Northern Mariana Islands: The least-populated area controlled by the United States, this commonwealth has already decided the victors in its primary. Having voted in favor of Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary on Saturday, today the commonwealth\u2019s Republican voters supported billionaire Republican frontrunner Donald Trump, who took home 73% of the commonwealth\u2019s vote and has won all nine of its delegates. The governor of the Northern Mariana Islands had endorsed Trump last week. Florida: Polling averages show the Sunshine State going for Trump by a nearly 20-point margin, and former secretary of state Clinton by a nearly 30-point margin. With heavy early voting that has already shattered records, previous poll trends bolster both of those candidacies. That\u2019s bad news for native son Marco Rubio, who has won only a single primary actually held in a US state. He has a mean, hungry look. On the Democratic side, a silver lining for Vermont senator Bernie Sanders: unlike in the Republican primary, Florida\u2019s delegates are assigned proportionately in the Democratic race, which means he won\u2019t be entirely shut out even in the event of a South Carolina-like landslide for Clinton. Ohio: We come to praise Rubio, not to bury him. The Florida senator\u2019s declaration that his supporters in Ohio who cared most about stopping Trump\u2019s ascent to the party\u2019s nomination should instead cast their vote for the Buckeye State\u2019s sitting governor, John Kasich, has led to a collapse in Rubio\u2019s polling numbers in the state, and coincided with a Kasich upswing that has him narrowly beating Trump in polling averages. Clinton is seen as a favorite here, but the potential for an upset in favor of Sanders in this anti-Nafta Rust Belt state is helping the senator\u2019s fans feel the Bern. Illinois: Seen in polling as another delegate-rich site of yet another Trump victory, Illinois is more interesting on the Democratic side, where some are predicting a Sanders upset. Slim polling has Clinton up, but only within the margin of error. Missouri: Another predicted Trump victory (spoiler alert: most politicos are anticipating a Trump sweep of all non-Ohio primaries tonight) and another area of concern for the Clinton campaign. The most recent Public Policy Polling survey has Sanders up by a single point here. North Carolina: Texas senator Ted Cruz\u2019s southern phalanx is likely to be officially DOA once the less-important Carolina (at least in national primaries, anyway) casts its votes for Trump. Clinton is seen as being on more secure ground here. We\u2019ll be offering minute-by-minute coverage of Super-er Tuesday, as well as last-minute pivots by campaigns to get out the vote. Stay tuned!",

Western diplomatic sources were both sceptical and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/14/russia-exit-syria-vladimir-putin-military-tactical-move\">startled by Putin\u2019s unexpected and mercurial move</a>. \u201cWe will have to wait and see what this represents.

The Russian president said the pullout would start on Tuesday, in a move that seems designed to coincide with the start of Syrian peace talks in Geneva and signals Russia\u2019s belief that it has done enough to protect the Assad regime from collapse. Putin said he had ordered his staff to step up their efforts to end the civil war which has cost at least 250,000 lives and is due to enter its sixth year on Tuesday. Western diplomatic sources were both sceptical and startled by Putin\u2019s unexpected and mercurial move. \u201cWe will have to wait and see what this represents. It is Putin.

She supported the use of natural gas as a \u201cbridge fuel,\u201d arguing:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>We need to implement all of the president\u2019s executive actions and quickly move to make a bridge from coal to natural gas to clean energy</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Clinton also argued that Sanders would delay implementation of the Clean Power Plan \u2013 a statement to which Sanders reacted incredulously, and <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/10/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-bernie-sanders-wants-delay-cl/\">which PolitiFact rated false</a>. However, Sanders does want to tweak the Clean Power Plan to make it tougher (for example, to incentivize renewables instead of natural gas, extend renewable tax credits to 2030, and to regulate methane emissions); it\u2019s true that <a href=\"http://legal-planet.org/2016/02/26/bernie-sanders-position-on-the-clean-power-plan/\">these changes could significantly delay implementation of the plan</a>, but they would also strengthen it.</p> <p>In his response to the climate question, Sanders noted that in 2013 he introduced what he described as \u201cthe most comprehensive <a href=\"http://grist.org/climate-energy/sanders-and-boxer-introduce-fee-and-dividend-climate-bill-greens-tickled-pink/\">climate change legislation</a> in the history of the United States.\u201d Sanders also called for a carbon tax and regulations to end fracking in the United States.</p> <h2><strong>Fracking natural gas \u2013 bridge fuel, or bridge to a hotter planet?</strong></h2> <p>There\u2019s a debate amongst climate scientists about whether natural gas is a viable \u2018bridge fuel\u2019 between fossil fuels and renewables. <a href=\"http://critical-angle.net/2015/01/08/fracking-2-theres-no-endorsement-of-fracking-from-skeptical-science-or-climate-experts/\">At best, natural gas releases half the carbon pollution as burning coal</a>. However, the amount of methane leakage during natural gas extraction is a big question mark that could erase most of its climate benefits. <br></p> <p>The other issue is that power plants have long lifespans, so choosing to install natural gas instead of a lower-carbon power source locks in its emissions for decades. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/dec/21/the-best-of-climate-science-and-humanity-come-together-at-agu\">Research by Zeke Hausfather and others has shown</a> that for these reasons, using natural gas as a \u2018bridge fuel\u2019 could make it easier to keep global warming at less than 3\u00b0C above pre-industrial temperatures, but harder to stay below the internationally-accepted 2\u00b0C target.</p> <p>Essentially, natural gas replacing coal power is an improvement. But if a coal power plant can be replaced by renewables or other low-carbon sources, that\u2019s a much better solution. If fracking makes natural gas so cheap that it <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2014/02/19/3296831/natural-gas-climate-benefit/\">crowds out deployment of renewables</a>, it could do more harm than good. It\u2019s a difficult question worthy of debate, although the balance of evidence suggests that we should rely on natural gas as little as possible (fracking also causes other <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2016/03/10/3757383/fracking-epa-review/\">environmental</a> <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-sej-oklahoma-quakes-fracking-20160302-story.html\">problems</a>).</p> <p>It\u2019s a debate that in large part can be solved by putting a price on carbon emissions, like the carbon tax that Sanders proposed.

          "bodyText": "Last week, the Democratic and Republican presidential candidates participated in debates in Florida. A bipartisan group of 21 Florida mayors wrote to the debate moderators to argue it would be \u201cunconscionable for these issues of grave concern for the people of Florida [climate change and sea level rise] to not be addressed.\u201d The moderators of both debates listened, and asked the candidates questions about climate change \u2013 including by far the most substantive climate question posed to the Republican candidates thus far. Sanders and Clinton spar over climate and fracking policies The climate discussion in the Democratic debate can be viewed in the video below. In her response (transcript available here), Hillary Clinton said that she would proceed with implementing President Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan, and his executive actions on climate change. She supported the use of natural gas as a \u201cbridge fuel,\u201d arguing: We need to implement all of the president\u2019s executive actions and quickly move to make a bridge from coal to natural gas to clean energy Clinton also argued that Sanders would delay implementation of the Clean Power Plan \u2013 a statement to which Sanders reacted incredulously, and which PolitiFact rated false. However, Sanders does want to tweak the Clean Power Plan to make it tougher (for example, to incentivize renewables instead of natural gas, extend renewable tax credits to 2030, and to regulate methane emissions); it\u2019s true that these changes could significantly delay implementation of the plan, but they would also strengthen it. In his response to the climate question, Sanders noted that in 2013 he introduced what he described as \u201cthe most comprehensive climate change legislation in the history of the United States.\u201d Sanders also called for a carbon tax and regulations to end fracking in the United States. Fracking natural gas \u2013 bridge fuel, or bridge to a hotter planet? There\u2019s a debate amongst climate scientists about whether natural gas is a viable \u2018bridge fuel\u2019 between fossil fuels and renewables. At best, natural gas releases half the carbon pollution as burning coal. However, the amount of methane leakage during natural gas extraction is a big question mark that could erase most of its climate benefits. The other issue is that power plants have long lifespans, so choosing to install natural gas instead of a lower-carbon power source locks in its emissions for decades. Research by Zeke Hausfather and others has shown that for these reasons, using natural gas as a \u2018bridge fuel\u2019 could make it easier to keep global warming at less than 3\u00b0C above pre-industrial temperatures, but harder to stay below the internationally-accepted 2\u00b0C target. Essentially, natural gas replacing coal power is an improvement. But if a coal power plant can be replaced by renewables or other low-carbon sources, that\u2019s a much better solution. If fracking makes natural gas so cheap that it crowds out deployment of renewables, it could do more harm than good. It\u2019s a difficult question worthy of debate, although the balance of evidence suggests that we should rely on natural gas as little as possible (fracking also causes other environmental problems). It\u2019s a debate that in large part can be solved by putting a price on carbon emissions, like the carbon tax that Sanders proposed. That would make energy prices reflect their true costs, including the costs of the damages they cause via climate change. A carbon price would make coal expensive, and could potentially make renewables cheaper than natural gas. Marco Rubio\u2019s climate word salad Marco Rubio gave the worst answer to a climate question in either debate. It was similar to the boilerplate response he gave in a previous Republican presidential debate. For example, he claimed that President Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan and every climate policy proposed by Democrats would cripple the economy, kill jobs, and make energy bill soar. However, studies have shown that carbon pollution pricing would have a minimal, potentially even modestly beneficial impact on the economy if the revenue is returned to taxpayers. Sanders\u2019 proposal takes this approach, refunding 60% of the revenue generated from the carbon tax directly back to Americans. On the other hand, failing to take action to slow climate change would have immense costs, which is why Florida\u2019s mayors are so concerned. According to a study by scientists at Climate Central, 2120 square miles of land lie less than 3 feet above the high tide line in Florida. Some $145 billion in property value, and 300,000 homes, sit on that land. These figures jump to $544 billion and 1.4 million homes on 4660 square miles of land under 6 feet. Every inch of sea level rise within these ranges will be more damaging than the previous inch. Rubio also argued that America can\u2019t slow global warming by itself, placing the blame on China and India. However, virtually every country in the world agreed to cut carbon pollution as a result of the Paris climate negotiations, including the United States, China, and India. In fact, while Rubio made comments about President Obama waging a war on coal, in reality China has been waging a fierce war on coal, and winning. Implementing dog-whistle politics to appeal to those in climate denial, Rubio used the popular \u2018climate always changes\u2019 logical fallacy, followed by the argument that, If there is higher sea levels, or whatever it may be happening, we do need to deal with that through mitigation, and I have long supported mitigation efforts. But as far as a law that we can pass in Washington to change the weather, there is no such thing. Of course, the only way we can mitigate the rising, accelerating sea levels that are causing flooding in Florida is by cutting the carbon pollution that\u2019s causing it. That\u2019s going to require the kinds of policies that Rubio opposes. Kasich counters Rubio\u2019s economic alarmism Fortunately, John Kasich followed Rubio with the most sensible climate-related comments made by a top 2016 Republican presidential candidate.

          "bodyText": "A joint US-Canadian declaration to help spur the transition to a low carbon economy passed the baton of global climate action from Barack Obama to Justin Trudeau on Thursday \u2013 and brightened prospects for the Paris agreement. The initiative, which roams from Arctic protection to plugging methane emissions from oil wells and pipelines to decarbonisation of the US and Canadian economies in the second half of this century, cements a new climate change partnership between neighbours after 15 years of pulling in opposite directions. It signals once again that Obama intends to keep pushing hard on climate change in what was supposed to be the lame duck phase of his presidency. And it improves the prospects of rallying countries to ratify the Paris climate agreement when it opens for signing on 22 April. The agreement needs to be signed by 55 countries responsible for 55% of global emissions to come into force. \u201cThe United States and Canada are fully united in combatting climate change,\u201d Obama told a press conference at the White House on Thursday. \u201cWe are focusing on making sure the Paris agreement is fully implemented.\u201d Trudeau agreed, describing the Paris agreement as an action plan, and the US and Canadian leaders as key players in ensuring its success. \u201cThat agreement is both a symbolic declaration of global cooperation on climate change as well a practical guide for growing our economies in a responsible and sustainable way,\u201d he told the press conference. \u201cWe know that our international partners expect and, indeed, need leadership from us on this issue.\u201d The US and Canada were committed to signing the Paris agreement as soon as possible, Trudeau went on, a move which could help the United Nations reach its goal of ratifying the agreement in 2016, before Obama leaves the White House. Thursday\u2019s declaration marks the first time in 15 years that US and Canadian leaders have been in sync on climate change. George Bush pulled the US out of the Kyoto climate accords when he came to the White House in 2001. Stephen Harper, the Canadian prime minister, also withdrew from the agreement and pushed aggressively the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, which would have ramped up production from the carbon-heavy Alberta tar sands. The two leaders began their relationship with some friction, with Obama cancelling the Keystone XL project last November, days after Trudeau took office. The Canadian leader did not protest, however. But with the declaration of a shared vision on climate change, Trudeau is now cast as Obama\u2019s heir \u2013 in terms of pressing for global actions. Once Obama leaves the White House, it will fall to Trudeau to maintain continuity of a North American climate plan should a Democrat takes the White House, or to help to keep the flame alive in the event a Republican wins the election and follows through on threats to overturn Obama\u2019s policies. The concern for Obama\u2019s long-term climate legacy was inherent in Thursday\u2019s declaration, with the US and Canada pledging to deliver plans for decarbonising the post-2050 economy by the end of 2016. The neighbours also pledged to lobby other G20 countries to produce their long-term climate plans \u2013 a move which could boost international confidence that the Paris agreement is indeed putting the global economy on a low-carbon trajectory. That could help box in Obama\u2019s successor \u2013 from either party \u2013 making it difficult to overturn the Paris agreement without the risk of antagonising an important ally and neighbour. The joint commitment to reduce methane emissions by up to 45% from 2012 by 2025 will have the most immediate impact in helping the US and Canada to hit the emissions reductions targets they offered at Paris. Emissions from methane \u2013 a far more powerful climate pollutant than carbon dioxide \u2013 rose rapidly with the boom in fracking. Campaigners had been pressing Obama to cut methane from existing oil and gas wells \u2013 not just future projects, warning the US had no chance of hitting its Paris targets without such measures. Gina McCarthy, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, agreed, telling a White House conference call with reporters: \u201cWe are going to have to tackle emissions from existing sources.\u201d The campaign group Earthworks, which has used infrared imaging to map methane leaks, said the new methane initiative was a significant step-up in Obama\u2019s efforts to cap emissions from oil and gas wells. \u201cWith today\u2019s announcement, President Obama starts to get serious,\u201d the organisation said in a statement. But it was on the global arena, where Obama played a critical role in nudging countries towards the Paris agreement, where the renewed US-Canadian partnership on climate change could have the most impact. \u201cOn the big looming issues on the horizon, it is vital for us to work together because the more aligned we are, the more we can shape the international agenda to meet these challenges,\u201d Obama said. \u201cClimate change is such an example.\u201d He suggested that having Trudeau on side with the two leaders\u2019 shared liberal values would help drive solutions to help poor countries deal with climate change. \u201cIf we don\u2019t agree, if we\u2019re not aggressive, if we\u2019re not far-sighted, if we don\u2019t pool our resources around the research and development and clean energy agenda that\u2019s required to solve this problem, then other countries won\u2019t step up and it won\u2019t get solved,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThat\u2019s a really important effort.\u201d The two leaders also pledged to secure a deal cutting emissions from commercial air planes through the International Civil Aviation Organisation, which is based in Montreal. They committed to raise fuel economy standards for delivery trucks and buses, and to work to get more solar and wind power on the US and Canadian electrical grids. On the Arctic, the two leaders pledged to take \u201cscience-based standards\u201d into account for any future oil and gas drilling. Noting the rapid disappearance of the sea ice cover, the US and Canada also committed to reduce the use of heavy fuel oil, set up low-impact shipping lanes, and work for sustainable commercial fishing. Obama and Trudeau will have another chance to work on Arctic protections at a White House summit in the autumn and, as officials made clear in a conference call, he has no intention of reining back on climate activism any time soon. The president will seek out climate partnerships with other countries in the remaining months, John Morton, an adviser, told reporters. \u201cI can tell you we are working actively on ensuring that in final year of the administration we see continued progress bilaterally and multilaterally,\u201d he told a conference call.",

Cruz reached out to Graham by telephone shortly after he made the comments, a sign that he is open to assuming the mantle of party alternative.</p> <p>Endorsements have nonetheless proved largely inconsequential in the Republican race thus far. Rubio rolled out a series of high-profile backers, from conservative stars within the Senate to sitting governors with high approval ratings, to little effect in the past two months.

His endorsement could help to boost Cruz ahead of Utah\u2019s March 22 primary, where the Texas senator is trailing Rubio by two points according to an average of publicly available polling. Rubio, of course, may no longer be in the race by the time the contest rolls around.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56e1db91e4b0b2eee93d502b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-03-10T20:41:12.761Z\">8.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Breitbart News Network CEO and president Larry Solov has released a statement in response to the Donald Trump campaign\u2019s attacks on Breitbart News reporter Michelle Fields, again calling on the campaign to apologize after Corey Lewandowski, Trump\u2019s campaign manager, allegedly assaulted Fields at a press conference on Tuesday.</p> <p>\u201cThe <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/inside-trumps-inner-circle-his-staffers-are-willing-to-fight-for-him-literally/2016/03/10/4b2b18e8-e660-11e5-a6f3-21ccdbc5f74e_story.html\">Washington Post just published</a> a very detailed, first-hand account from their senior reporter Ben Terris who is familiar with the campaign, the personalities involved, and was an eyewitness to the incident,\u201d Solov writes. \u201cWe are disappointed in the campaign\u2019s response, in particular their effort to demean Michelle\u2019s previous reporting.

On the other hand, Trump\u2019s bluster distracts attention from the others\u2019 stated positions, so if one of his competitors manages finally to make the case, to the public or the party, that he is least objectionable, the claim might well be groundless. <br></p> <p>Trump and the others are the product of the souring of the party system. Someone should point out, in these days when the constitution is so constantly and pietistically invoked, that political parties are not mentioned in the constitution, and that the prescient founders warned emphatically against them for reasons that should be clear to us now. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/10/trump-the-great-orange-haired-unintended-consequence\">Trump: the great orange-haired Unintended Consequence | Marilynne Robinson</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56e1a998e4b0dfdfc0924d43\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/mahita-gajanan\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-03-10T17:08:15.119Z\">5.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Supreme court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is co-writing a new book to be released in January 2017.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d3bef11bb168291620941392c6a467b95e6aebab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3bef11bb168291620941392c6a467b95e6aebab/0_0_6144_4089/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ruth Bader Ginsburg celebrating her 20th anniversary on the bench.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ruth Bader Ginsburg celebrating her 20th anniversary on the bench.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Washington Post/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The book, entitled My Own Words, will comprise of a \u201cselection of writings and speeches by Justice Ginsburg on wide-ranging topics, including gender equality, the workways of the supreme court, on being Jewish, on law and lawyers in opera and on the value of looking beyond US shores when interpreting the US constitution\u201d, according to a <a href=\"http://about.simonandschuster.biz/news/rbg-my-own-words/\">statement</a> from Simon and Schuster.<br></p> <p>My Own Words will be a collaborative effort between Ginsburg and her authorized biographers, Mary Hartnett and Wendy W Williams.

          "bodyText": "Here\u2019s an update: we have a new blog going to cover tonight\u2019s Republican debate in Miami. Please join us over here. Thanks as always for reading and participating. Politico has published an audio recording of Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields and Washington Post reporter Ben Terris talking about Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski allegedly assaulting Fields. The Trump campaign released a statement earlier today calling the report of the assault \u201ccompletely false\u201d and attacking Fields as an attention seeker. Lewandowski himself took to Twitter to call Fields an \u201cattention seeker\u201d and to say she once made a sexual harassment complaint but afterwards fell silent. He physically aggressed her, to believe the audio, photo of her bruises and witness \u2013 and then denied the incident ever happened and sought to assassinate her character: That was then: The Guardian has confirmed that Ben Carson will endorse Donald Trump for president tomorrow. Last November Trump said voters would be \u201cstupid\u201d to believe stories Carson told about his life in his memoir Gifted Hands and elsewhere. But that was then. Trump and Carson haven\u2019t always been simpatico. In a November riff on Carson\u2019s description of his childhood temper as \u201cpathological,\u201d Trump drew a child molester comparison: Here\u2019s the lede of the latest from Post reporter Robert Costa: MIAMI \u2014 Conservative favorite Ben Carson, who recently suspended his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, plans to endorse Donald Trump on Friday morning, according to two people familiar with his thinking. Costa reports the endorsement will go down at Mar-a-Lago, Trump\u2019s Palm Beach Shangri La. Go. Read the full piece here. Ben Carson told Fox News radio today that he is \u201ccertainly leaning\u201d toward endorsing Donald Trump over Ted Cruz. Carson\u2019s central concern appears to be maintaining party unity so that the Republican candidate beats the Democrat in November so that the next Supreme Court justice(s) is/are nominated by a Republican president. And Carson thinks having Trump at the top of the ticket could attract more Republican voters. Carson also explained his view of the two Donald Trumps: You know there are two Donald Trumps. There\u2019s the Donald Trump that you see on television and who gets out in front of big audiences, and there\u2019s the Donald Trump behind the scenes. They\u2019re not the same person. One\u2019s very much an entertainer, and one is actually a thinking individual.\u201d Listen to the 10-minute interview with host John Gibson here. Trump did Carson a solid by standing with him at a debate last month when Carson missed a cue: The White House is hosting Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau tonight for a state dinner. It\u2019s the first state dinner for a Canadian leader hosted by the White House in 19 years. It\u2019s just so far to come. Here\u2019s a look at tonight\u2019s menu, \u201cThe Anticipation of Spring.\u201d It\u2019s about what you would expect, baked Halibut, salad, and whiskey-drizzled lamb. Which reminds us, it\u2019s debate night! \u2013 and time to order pizza. Cheese pizza. We\u2019re calling it \u201cThe Anticipation of the 12th Republican debate.\u201d Let\u2019s take a break from news of physical violence at Trump rallies for some lighter fare. Here\u2019s an entertainingly edited video of Bernie Sanders dismissing the notion that he might consider being Hillary Clinton\u2019s vice presidential running mate. \u201cWould she be interested in being my vice president?\u201d Politico has obtained an audio recording of the alleged assault by Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski on Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields. The recording, which Politico has transcribed but not posted, captures a conversation between Fields and Washington Post reporter Ben Terris before and after the incident. The conversation includes these lines: Terris: \u201cYou OK?\u201d Fields: \u201cHoly sh*t.\u201d Terris: \u201cYea he just threw you down.\u201d Fields: \u201cI can\u2019t believe he just did that that was so hard. Was that Corey?\u201d Terris: \u201cYeah, like, what threat were you?\u201d Fields: \u201cThat was insane. You should have felt how hard he grabbed me. That\u2019s insane. I\u2019ve never had anyone do that to me from a campaign.\u201d Terris: \u201cCan I put that in my story?\u201d Fields: \u201cYeah, go for it \u2014 that was really awful. That\u2019s so unprofessional.\u201d Terris: \u201cHe really just almost threw you down on the ground.\u201d Read the full piece here. John McGraw, the Donald Trump supporter who sucker-punched an African American protester at a rally in North Carolina last night, told a reporter who interviewed him about the incident that he thought the protester, Rakeem Jones, might have been a member of Isis. \u201cThe next time we see him, we might have to kill him,\u201d McGraw told Inside Edition. \u201cWe don\u2019t know who he is. He might be with a terrorist organization.\u201d Ted Cruz earned his first endorsement from a college in the US Senate on Thursday, as influential conservative Mike Lee of Utah backed the Texas senator\u2019s presidential campaign, writes Guardian politics reporter Sabrina Siddiqui: Addressing reporters in Miami ahead of tonight\u2019s Republican debate, Lee said it was time to rally around Cruz as the only viable alternative to frontrunner Donald Trump. \u201cUnity in the Republican Party is more important than ever before,\u201d Lee said. \u201cI call on all within the sound of my voice to join in my cause.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s time my fellow Americans, and my fellow Republicans, to unite behind one candidate: That candidate is Ted Cruz.\u201d Lee\u2019s endorsement was a blow to Marco Rubio, the Florida senator whose campaign is on life support ahead of the state\u2019s March 15 primary. Lee made separate appearances in South Carolina last month with both Rubio and Cruz and had planned, according to his aides, to stay neutral until one of his two friends dropped out of the race. But as Rubio faces an uphill battle against Trump in Florida, where a loss will all but spell a certain end to his bid for president, Lee sent a signal that it was time for him to fold. \u201cIf senator Rubio were asking me that, I would encourage him, and I do encourage him to get behind Ted Cruz,\u201d Lee said when asked if it was time for Rubio to exit the race. \u201cI\u2019m sending the signal that it\u2019s time to unite \u2026 We as Republicans need to unite behind one leader.\u201d Lee is the first member of the US Senate to throw his support behind Cruz, who remains unpopular among his colleagues after building a brand as a rabble-rouser with little, if any, regard for rules and decorum. But with Cruz proving the only candidate to defeat Trump in a number of primary contests, a growing number of Republican lawmakers have indicated they might be coming around to the idea of rallying behind Cruz. South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham, who so loathes Cruz that he recently joked about his murder, acknowledged last week it was essentially Cruz or bust if the party is to blunt Trump\u2019s momentum. Cruz reached out to Graham by telephone shortly after he made the comments, a sign that he is open to assuming the mantle of party alternative. Endorsements have nonetheless proved largely inconsequential in the Republican race thus far. Rubio rolled out a series of high-profile backers, from conservative stars within the Senate to sitting governors with high approval ratings, to little effect in the past two months. For Cruz, there is the added paradox that he has built his image as taking on the so-called \u201cWashington cartel,\u201d a message that could be undermined if he embraces its support. Lee is, however, an exception who remains popular among the tea party and libertarian factions of the Republican Party. His endorsement could help to boost Cruz ahead of Utah\u2019s March 22 primary, where the Texas senator is trailing Rubio by two points according to an average of publicly available polling. Rubio, of course, may no longer be in the race by the time the contest rolls around. Breitbart News Network CEO and president Larry Solov has released a statement in response to the Donald Trump campaign\u2019s attacks on Breitbart News reporter Michelle Fields, again calling on the campaign to apologize after Corey Lewandowski, Trump\u2019s campaign manager, allegedly assaulted Fields at a press conference on Tuesday. \u201cThe Washington Post just published a very detailed, first-hand account from their senior reporter Ben Terris who is familiar with the campaign, the personalities involved, and was an eyewitness to the incident,\u201d Solov writes. \u201cWe are disappointed in the campaign\u2019s response, in particular their effort to demean Michelle\u2019s previous reporting. Michelle Fields is an intrepid reporter who has covered tough and dangerous stories. We stand behind her reporting, her techniques, and call again on Corey Lewandowski to apologize.\u201d Corey Lewandowski, campaign manager for billionaire Republican frontrunner Donald Trump, is waging a Twitter war on Michelle Fields, a reporter for Breitbart News who claims he manhandled her following a press conference on Tuesday, is accusing the reporter of doing it for attention. The tweet links to a blog post written by controversial Internet personality Chuck Johnson in which he reported unconfirmed rumors that former congressman Allen West assaulted her. Johnson has been banned from Twitter for repeated attempts to incite violence against other users. Fields was reporting from a press conference at the Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter, Florida, on Tuesday night, when she approached the candidate to ask him about his stance on affirmative action, according to a piece she wrote for the conservative outlet titled \u201cMichelle Fields: In Her Own Words.\u201d \u201cTrump acknowledged the question, but before he could answer I was jolted backwards. Someone had grabbed me tightly by the arm and yanked me down,\u201d Fields wrote. \u201cI almost fell to the ground, but was able to maintain my balance. Nonetheless, I was shaken.\u201d Fields says that she didn\u2019t know who had pulled her down until another reporter \u201cremarked that it was Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, who aggressively tried to pull me to the ground.\u201d Lewandowski was seen exiting the space with Trump moments later. \u201cNo apology. No explanation for why he did this,\u201d Fields wrote. The Trump campaign has denied that anything matching Fields\u2019 description occurred. The Senate judiciary committee chairman on Thursday reaffirmed his pledge not to consider an Obama nomination for the open seat on the supreme court, adding calls for a hearing were \u201ca charade\u201d and \u201cabsurd\u201d. \u201cIn case there is any confusion over whether this obvious political ploy would work, let me be crystal clear: it won\u2019t,\u201d Chuck Grassley said during a committee business meeting. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to drop any nominee into that election-year cauldron.\u201d \u201cHe is trying to protect this person from the hot boiling cauldron of thiscommittee,\u201d responded Senator Dick Durban of Illinois, adding: \u201cWell, who is turning up the heat?\u201d Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski has responded to Breitbart News reporter Michelle Fields\u2019 allegation that he manhandled her at a campaign event on Tuesday, accusing Fields of being a serial fabulist. Lewandowski\u2019s tweet links to a 2011 story about Fields and another reporter being beaten by New York Police Department officers at an Occupy Wall Street protest. In a statement released by Hope Hicks, Trump\u2019s communications director, the Trump campaign declared that although \u201cwe leave to others whether this is part of a larger pattern of exaggerating incidents ... on multiple occasions she has become part of the news story as opposed to reporting it. Recall she also claimed to have been beaten by a New York City Police officer with a baton.\u201d Fields\u2019 boyfriend, Daily Caller senior editor Jamie Weinstein, tweeted a photograph of Fields being hit with a baton taken at the protest in question in response to Hicks\u2019 statement. Donald Trump\u2019s campaign communications manager, Hope Hicks, has released a statement following an accusation by a writer at Breitbart News she was forcibly \u201cyanked\u201d away from the candidate by Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski. \u201cThe accusation, which has only been made in the media and never addressed directly with the campaign, is entirely false,\u201d Hicks said in a statement released to the Guardian. \u201cAs one of dozens of individuals present as Mr. Trump exited the press conference I did not witness any encounter. In addition to our staff, which had no knowledge of said situation, not a single camera or reporter of more than 100 in attendance captured the alleged incident. This individual has never met Corey, nor had the only reporter that supposedly identified him.\u201d \u201cThere are often large crowds aggressively seeking access to Mr. Trump and our staff would never do anything to harm another individual, while at the same time understanding that Mr. Trump and his personal space should never be invaded.\u201d \u201cThis person claims she does not want to be part of the news, and only report it, however if that was the case, any concerns, however unfounded they may be, should have been voiced directly first and not via Twitter, especially since no other outlet or reporter witnessed or questioned anything that transpired that evening. We leave to others whether this is part of a larger pattern of exaggerating incidents, but on multiple occasions she has become part of the news story as opposed to reporting it. Recall she also claimed to have been beaten by a New York City Police officer with a baton. In response, Michelle Fields, the reporter in question, tweeted this photo of bruises on her arm: The second poll today shows Republican frontrunner Donald Trump leading Florida senator Marco Rubio by single digits in the beleaguered candidate\u2019s home state. Trump holds a 9-point lead over Rubio in Florida, according to the latest poll from Suffolk University, with support of 36% of likely Republican voters to Rubio\u2019s 27%. Texas senator Ted Cruz is in third place with 19% of the vote, with Ohio governor John Kasich at a mere 10%. The results were released only hours after a Washington Post/Univision poll of likely Floridian Republican voters found that found Trump leads Rubio by 7 points in the Sunshine State. Other polls have found the real estate tycoon with a double-digit lead in Florida, boosted by surveys showing that one-fourth of Florida\u2019s early voters - that is, those who have already cast their ballots - are first-time or long-dormant voters, a key Trump demographic. Rubio has pinned the fate of his campaign on winning his home state, which has a winner-take-all primary scheduled on Tuesday. Although the polling gap may be narrowing, Trump\u2019s lead could conceivably shrink to a single vote and he would still take home all 99 of Florida\u2019s delegates. Along with his lead in Ohio, another winner-take-all state with a primary scheduled for Tuesday, Trump has declared that if he wins the next two major states, he\u2019ll have sewn up the nomination. Texas senator Ted Cruz is about to receive his first endorsement from a colleague in the US senate, according to Buzzfeed. Mike Lee, a Republican from Utah, will reportedly endorse Cruz\u2019s candidacy for president on Thursday afternoon. Lee, who like Cruz is a former constitutional lawyer who arose to prominence on the back of the Tea Party movement, was Cruz\u2019sbiggest - and only - ally in his bid to defund the Affordable Care Act in 2013. It was that episode that alienated Cruz from many of his Republican colleagues on Capitol Hill, a possible explanation for the tardiness of a single endorsement from the US senate for the candidate. The public is exasperated by the political system to the point that it is enjoying a kind of catharsis in the form of Donald Trump, writes Marilynn Robinson: Donald Trump is not really exceptional among current Republican presidential candidates. He is the one with the brightest plumage, of course, and the one who has had long experience at cultivating celebrity. If Trump seems strangely incapable of consistency except in the matter of walling out and deporting immigrants, somber Ted Cruz is lurking nearby to alarm us with his ideological purity. If Trump is his own invention, there is Rubio, the polished creature of hired advisors and their moment-to-moment calculations. The only satisfaction to be found in a Trump win lies in the fact that the others have lost, and lost badly. On the other hand, Trump\u2019s bluster distracts attention from the others\u2019 stated positions, so if one of his competitors manages finally to make the case, to the public or the party, that he is least objectionable, the claim might well be groundless. Trump and the others are the product of the souring of the party system. Someone should point out, in these days when the constitution is so constantly and pietistically invoked, that political parties are not mentioned in the constitution, and that the prescient founders warned emphatically against them for reasons that should be clear to us now. Supreme court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is co-writing a new book to be released in January 2017. The book, entitled My Own Words, will comprise of a \u201cselection of writings and speeches by Justice Ginsburg on wide-ranging topics, including gender equality, the workways of the supreme court, on being Jewish, on law and lawyers in opera and on the value of looking beyond US shores when interpreting the US constitution\u201d, according to a statement from Simon and Schuster. My Own Words will be a collaborative effort between Ginsburg and her authorized biographers, Mary Hartnett and Wendy W Williams. Ginsburg will write an introduction to the book and Hartnett and Williams will write introductions to each of the chapters with quotes from the hundreds of interviews they have conducted with Ginsburg for a forthcoming biography of the justice. Hartnett and Williams will also assist Ginsburg in selecting the writings to be included in the book. Ginsburg is one of the supreme court\u2019s most public figures, a liberal champion, and a feminist pop culture icon. Last year, the book Notorious RBG: The Life and Times of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, based on a fan site, proved a popular hit. Karl Rove, Republican political consultant and architect of George W Bush\u2019s political career, dismissed a major speech given last week by Bush\u2019s would-have-been successor, Mitt Romney, that took aim at Republican frontrunner Donald Trump. \u201cI respect governor Romney a lot, but I thought it was the wrong message from the wrong messenger on the wrong day,\u201d Rove told Michigan radio show host Michael Patrick Shiels. \u201cThis was the day of the debate, and so it\u2019s going to get overwhelmed largely by last night, and I thought the speech was good but not great, and it gave Trump a chance to come back and remind his supporters of the thing that motivates them, which is: Romney lost.\u201d \u201cWith Donald Trump supporters, this sense of aggrievement that \u2018we could have won\u2019 - which a lot of Republicans feel, me included, and it would have much better for the country if we had won, it is an important touchpoint for his supporters,\u201d Rove continued. LIVE: Marco Rubio speaking in Kissimmee, Florida: Failure to turn around his dwindling fortunes in his home state would likely end Marco Rubio\u2019s presidential bid, report the Guardian\u2019s Sabrina Siddiqui and Richard Luscombe, and some polls have Donald Trump ahead by double digits. Beneath his veneer of confidence was the reality that Rubio faces mounting pressure after a series of losses in the Republican primaries that have only appeared to grow more bruising with each passing contest. And while some pollsshow Rubio slowly inching closer to Donald Trump in Florida, several others find the Republican frontrunner leading by double digits. Even a number of influential conservatives who had previously waxed poetic about his prospects threw in the towel on Wednesday, suggesting that Rubio should suspend his campaign. Absent a win in Florida, it is all but certain Rubio will have no other option but to quit the race. And so while crisscrossing his home state with the fate of his presidential aspirations in their hands Rubio is imploring voters to understand the urgency of the moment. Speaking in an airport hangar in Sarasota, Rubio struck a similarly pressing tone: \u201cIt has to happen here, and it has to happen now.\u201d Former secretary of state and Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton has been accused of skirting the rules during last night\u2019s Democratic primary debate in Miami. Fox News Channel reporter Ed Henry tweeted a photo from backstage at the debate that appears to show Clinton with her campaign staff during a commercial break. Candidates are barred from meeting with aides during debates. Clinton spokesperson Jen Palmieri told Henry that she \u201cwasn\u2019t aware of the pic.\u201d Billionaire Republican frontrunner Donald Trump was accused of of breaking similar rules during the latest Fox News debate, leading the network to suspend the rule for all of the Republican candidates so as to level the playing field. Some good news for Barack Obama: More Americans say that he\u2019s doing a good job as president than have said so in the past three years, according to the latest Gallup poll of the president\u2019s approval rating. Obama earned a 50% job approval rating for the week ending March 6, the highest average for the president since May of 2013. That\u2019s four points higher than his average approval rating for all of last year, and three points higher than his administration\u2019s average since January of 2009 when he took office. The rating is extremely partisan, with 87% of Democrats approving of the job Obama is doing as president compared to a mere 11% of Republicans. It\u2019s the final primary stretch, and Donald Trump is starting to sound presidential, writes Christopher R Barron: Trump is not a typical candidate, and he hardly delivers a typical political stump speech, but there is no question that the political neophyte has been a quick study. Trump is a vastly better candidate than he was just a few months ago. He seemed restrained by Trump standards last night. He looked, dare I say, almost... presidential. He was short on policy specifics, but his voters aren\u2019t coming for wonky policy details. What he lacks in policy chops he more than compensates for in his ability to connect to voters. He knows his voters, he knows what they want to hear, and he gives it to them, delivering a powerful emotional moment in his rally when a Marine vet, left disfigured by an IED explosion, came on stage to ask him what he would do about healthcare for veterans. Another sign of Trump\u2019s growing confidence about his prospects for securing the nomination: he barely mentioned his primary opponents. Instead of attacking his GOP rivals, Trump made the case that he would be the best candidate to defeat Hillary Clinton. And he didn\u2019t make a terrible case. As Donald Trump\u2019s campaign manager continues to dodge questions about a physical alternation with a female reporter at a press conference on Tuesday, multiple videos have surfaced showing an anti-Trump protestor being punched in the face by a supporter of the billionaire Republican frontrunner. The videos, taken from different angles by multiple people, show an African American man being led out of a Trump rally by Cumberland County sheriff officers as the audience boos. A bystander, a white man with a pony tail and a cowboy hat, then sucker-punches the man in the face seemingly without provocation. The crowd cheers as the protestor stumbles away and is tackled by multiple Cumberland County sheriff officers, then handcuffed. The candidate, whose rallies have begun earning a reputation for violent outbursts, has not condemned the actions of his supporters in the past. During an interruption at one of his rallies in Kentucky last week, Trump told the audience to \u201cget him out. Try not to hurt him. If you do I\u2019ll defend you in court.\u201d After a rally in Birmingham, Alabama, in which white attendees assaulted a black protester who disrupted his speech, Trump declared \u201cMaybe he should have been roughed up.\u201d Of a protestor at a rally on Las Vegas, Trump told the crowd from the lectern that \u201cI\u2019d like to punch him in the face.\u201d A writer at Breitbart News has released a statement regarding an incident at a Donald Trump rally on Tuesday night in which she was forcibly \u201cyanked\u201d away from the candidate by Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski. Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields was reporting from a press conference at the Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter, Florida, on Tuesday night, when she approached the candidate to ask him about his stance on affirmative action, she writes for the conservative outlet in a post titled \u201cMichelle Fields: In Her Own Words.\u201d \u201cTrump acknowledged the question, but before he could answer I was jolted backwards. Someone had grabbed me tightly by the arm and yanked me down,\u201d Fields writes. \u201cI almost fell to the ground, but was able to maintain my balance. Nonetheless, I was shaken.\u201d Fields says that she didn\u2019t know who had pulled her down until another reporter \u201cremarked that it was Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, who aggressively tried to pull me to the ground.\u201d Lewandowski was seen exiting the space with Trump moments later. \u201cNo apology. No explanation for why he did this,\u201d Fields writes. Jaime Weinstein, a senior editor at Daily Caller and Fields\u2019 boyfriend, tweeted about incident soon thereafter: It wouldn\u2019t be the first time that members of Trump\u2019s campaign or security team had a physical altercation with members of the press. Last week, longtime Time photographer Chris Morris was put in a chokehold and slammed backwards into a table by a Secret Service agent at a rally in Virginia after attempting to leave the designated press area. In a statement to Politico about the incident, Breitbart News CEO Larry Solov declared that if what Fields says it true, she deserves an apology from Trump\u2019s campaign manager. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously unacceptable that someone crossed a line and made physical contact with our reporter,\u201d Solov stated. \u201cWhat Michelle has told us directly is that someone \u2018grabbed her arm\u2019 and while she did not see who it was, Ben Terris of the Washington Post told her that it was Corey Lewandowski. If that\u2019s the case, Corey owes Michelle an immediate apology.\u201d Good pre-and-post-debate morning ... We\u2019re in the blissful hours between last night\u2019s Democratic presidential debate in Miami and tonight\u2019s Republican presidential debate in Miami. Last night\u2019s Latino-centric engagement on Univision saw immigration policy dominate the fourth Hillary v Bernie clash, with former secretary of state Clinton accusing Vermont senator Sanders of supporting \u201cMinuteman vigilantes in their ridiculous efforts to hunt down immigrants.\u201d Sanders, in turn, criticized Clinton\u2019s past statements about deporting child immigrants from Honduras. Both Democratic candidates agreed on one point, however: that the American people will never elect billionaire Republican frontrunner Donald Trump. Clinton declared at the debate that she found Trump\u2019s rhetoric \u201cdeeply offensive\u201d and said his \u201ctrafficking in prejudice and paranoia\u201d would not be tolerated, while Sanders went a step further and implied Trump might be a racist, due to his previous involvement in the \u201cbirther\u201d movement. Expect a similar dogpile on the Republican frontrunner in Miami again tonight: Florida senator Marco Rubio may have expressed regret about mocking the size of Trump\u2019s hands in campaign rallies in recent weeks \u2013 telling Anderson Cooper that \u201cmy kids were embarrassed by it\u201d and \u201cif I had to do it again, I wouldn\u2019t\u201d \u2013 but a recent batch of polls show that Florida\u2019s native son is far behind Trump in the waning days before its winner-take-all primary on Tuesday. Trump has gone on the record stating that if he wins Florida and Ohio \u2013 another delegate-rich winner-take-all state \u2013 next week, he\u2019ll have sewn up the nomination. Or, as the New York Post put it: This may explain why former Florida governor and failed Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush has scheduled three one-on-one meetings in the hours before tonight\u2019s debate with all three of the non-Trump candidates. Bush met with Rubio yesterday, according to the New York Times, and will meet with Ohio governor John Kasich and Texas senator Ted Cruz today. What could they be meeting about? Well, for starters, Bush hasn\u2019t yet endorsed a candidate for the Republican nomination. We\u2019ll be covering all this and more in our minute-by-minute coverage of today\u2019s political news in the Sunshine State with our stellar team of mild-mannered reporters: Sabrina Siddiqui is in Florida with Rubio and Dan Roberts is in Tampa with Clinton.",
