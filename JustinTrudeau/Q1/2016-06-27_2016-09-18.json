Activists claim that Obama has been too slow to respond to the gathering storm, even after recently achieving his target of accepting 10,000 refugees from Syria in the last fiscal year.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that is enough because the Syrian people are suffering the crisis,\u201d Acuoth said. \u201cI think they should take more because I was a former refugee and I know how that felt.

I thought I would just live in a camp forever. But then, when I had the opportunity to come here, I saw I value in my life and what it means to be somebody.\u201d</p> <p>But some of them never made it, because the 9/11 terrorist attacks led to US borders being virtually closed to refugees. </p> <p>The door has slowly edged open again in recent years. In the 12 months ending 30 September, the goal was 85,000, and in each of the three years prior, the target was 70,000. </p> <p>Campaigners say much more is necessary to come to grips with the 20 million refugees worldwide. But fears of terrorism bring political risk, notably after the attack in San Bernardino, California, and incidents in Europe connected to people who had spent time in Syria. Republican governors have sought to keep refugees out of their states while the party\u2019s presidential nominee, Donald Trump, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/02/donald-trump-syria-refugees-us-immigration-security-terrorism\">threatened to slam the door shut again</a>.</p> <p>Ibrahim al-Assil, president and cofounder of the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SyrainNonviolence\">Syrian Nonviolence Movement</a>, argued that the US had a special responsibility after its failure to intervene in Syria, notably when Obama did not follow through on warning that the regime\u2019s use of chemical weapons would cross a \u201cred line\u201d. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e9495b76ee690f6013439d6660e311022f35f591\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9495b76ee690f6013439d6660e311022f35f591/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barack Obama addresses the UN general assembly last year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barack Obama addresses the UN general assembly last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Drew/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.wilsoncenter.org/event/stateless-not-silenced-conversation-refugees-refugees\">Speaking at the Wilson Center thinktank</a> in Washington, Assil said: \u201cOf course, the number that is being admitted to the US is very, very low, extremely low. The US on the political level committed some mistakes at least when they put the red line and then they didn\u2019t enforce that red line. So I think they should share that responsibility and they should admit more Syrians as refugees to the United States.\u201d</p> <p>Even when refugees get on American soil, they face a lengthy wait to be cleared for asylum. Assil said he himself has cofounded a civil society group, cofounded a business and gained a job at a thinktank but is still in legal limbo, waiting on an asylum application filed in 2014. \u201cSo imagine how difficult it is for other people as well.\u201d</p> <p>Officials have said potential refugees are subject to a rigorous screening process that typically lasts two years and involves both in-person interviews and further vetting by the state department, the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, the defense department and US Citizenship and Immigration Services and an examination of biographical and biometric data.</p> <p>Rouba Mhaissen, founder and director of the refugee initiative <a href=\"http://www.sdaid.org/about-us\">Sawa for Development and Aid</a>, said: \u201cWhen you hear \u2018110,000 to be admitted\u2019, this is amazing news, but between the moment this decision is taken and the moment these people arrive in the US, it can take up to two years.\u201d</p> <p>The US is the world\u2019s biggest donor to refugee programmes and provides a third of the budget for the UN high commissioner for refugees. But politicians in Europe, where some 1 million people arrived last year, have expressed concern that Washington does not appreciate the scale of the crisis.</p> <p>Of the 110,000 that the US will admit in the coming year, 40,000 will come from the Middle East and South Asia. An additional 35,000 will come from Africa, 12,000 from east Asia, 4,000 from Europe and 5,000 from Latin America and the Caribbean.

If Obama had done four years ago what he is doing now, I think we would be in a much better place to respond to refugees. But now he\u2019s very limited in what he can do.\u201d</p> <p>Washington also has been condemned for its passive approach to people fleeing a surge in violence in Central America. It announced last month that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/26/central-american-refugees-costa-rica-obama-administration\">Costa Rica would offer temporary protection</a> to Central American refugees, as American efforts had been overwhelmed since 2012 by a fivefold growth of people leaving Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala.</p> <p>The White House has defended its actions.

The United States is obviously in a different place, literally, than countries in Europe. The United States is separated by a large ocean when it comes to these refugees.</p> <p>\u201cSo the situation that we face is different when it comes to this set of refugees. And the president does believe it\u2019s important for the United States to do our part. That\u2019s why we increased our ambition and admitted 10,000 Syrian refugees this fiscal year. But I think the president certainly would like to see the United States continue to ramp up our commitment.\u201d</p>",

          "body": "<p>Barack Obama\u2019s announcement that the United States proposes to admit 110,000 refugees over the course of the next year has elicited a <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/09/14/outgoing-obama-plans-to-increase-refugees-by-twenty-nine-percent-next-year/\">furious</a> reaction from some Republican leaders. This was predictable. A spirit of xenophobia has once again taken hold in the United States, as has happened on several previous occasions in American history.</p> <p>As early as 1798, just a few years after the establishment of the Republic, Congress adopted a Naturalization law that was intended to keep out radicals who could promote sedition. The main targets were the French, who might spread the \u201cJacobin\u201d ideology of the French Revolution. In the 19th century, a focus of exclusion was the Chinese who were explicitly kept out under the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. That law was not repealed until 1943, when it became embarrassing because China was an ally of the United States in the war against Japan. In the early part of the 20th century, a number of measures were adopted to limit the admission of southern Europeans, such as the Italians, ostensibly because they were thought to be more likely to spread the anarchist ideology than fairer-skinned immigrants from northern Europe. And so things have gone.</p> <p>Today, of course, the main focus of those denouncing Obama\u2019s proposal is Syrian refugees. Up to now, the United States has admitted a few more than 10,000. So far, at least, their resettlement in the United States has seemed to go very well, though Indiana Governor Mike Pence, Donald Trump\u2019s running mate, has tried to keep them out of his state.</p> <p>Additional refugees from Syria would constitute a minority of those that Obama proposes to admit over the next year. The number projected for all countries in the Middle East and South Asia is 40,000.

          "bodyText": "Barack Obama\u2019s announcement that the United States proposes to admit 110,000 refugees over the course of the next year has elicited a furious reaction from some Republican leaders. This was predictable. A spirit of xenophobia has once again taken hold in the United States, as has happened on several previous occasions in American history. As early as 1798, just a few years after the establishment of the Republic, Congress adopted a Naturalization law that was intended to keep out radicals who could promote sedition. The main targets were the French, who might spread the \u201cJacobin\u201d ideology of the French Revolution. In the 19th century, a focus of exclusion was the Chinese who were explicitly kept out under the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. That law was not repealed until 1943, when it became embarrassing because China was an ally of the United States in the war against Japan. In the early part of the 20th century, a number of measures were adopted to limit the admission of southern Europeans, such as the Italians, ostensibly because they were thought to be more likely to spread the anarchist ideology than fairer-skinned immigrants from northern Europe. And so things have gone. Today, of course, the main focus of those denouncing Obama\u2019s proposal is Syrian refugees. Up to now, the United States has admitted a few more than 10,000. So far, at least, their resettlement in the United States has seemed to go very well, though Indiana Governor Mike Pence, Donald Trump\u2019s running mate, has tried to keep them out of his state. Additional refugees from Syria would constitute a minority of those that Obama proposes to admit over the next year. The number projected for all countries in the Middle East and South Asia is 40,000. Yet in this election year, in which the Republican nominee for president swept aside his opponents for the nomination by saying he would deport 11 million undocumented immigrants from Mexico, and he would bar all Muslims from entering the United States, has made xenophobia look like a winning political strategy. As should be apparent, a wealthy country of 320 million people can easily absorb 110,000 refugees. In the year that ends 30 September, America\u2019s goal has been 85,000 refugees.

Turnbull really threw his all into the role of \u201cAustralia\u2019s most inept prime minister\u201d by trying his best to match Abbott\u2019s Newspoll net satisfaction ratings. He also wasted a lot of political capital by introducing legislation to run Abbott\u2019s plebiscite on same-sex marriage \u2013 the very process that Turnbull had decried just 13 months ago. </p> <p>The part of Turnbull was played by Bill Shorten. Not only did Shorten announce Coalition government policy but he also took a Dixer in question time and junked the last two days of parliament so he could meet the Canadian prime minister. </p> <p>(By the way, I think I speak for a large portion of Australia \u2013 men and women alike \u2013 when I say I understand Shorten\u2019s decision. Given a choice of looking across the chamber at the Coalition frontbench, or across the table at Justin Trudeau, I know where I\u2019d rather be.)</p> <p>The part of the responsible and grown-up treasurer of Australia was played by Scott Morrison. He negotiated in good faith with the opposition to pass the omnibus savings legislation. He also resolved the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/15/superannuation-backflip-on-500000-cap-wins-over-coalition-conservatives\">superannuation debate</a> that had been paralysing his government. I don\u2019t know where the Coalition found this guy, but he\u2019s a vast improvement on their usual treasurer. </p> <p>And the part of Shorten was played by Tanya Plibersek. In Shorten\u2019s absence she led the opposition in question time in what I judged to be an admirable effort. </p> <p>For a brief moment it looked like Peter Dutton would be playing the part of the Tin Man in the Wizard of Oz (you know, he\u2019d discover that he really did have a heart all along). An ambiguous interview <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/15/peter-dutton-open-to-refugees-on-nauru-being-resettled-in-new-zealand\">Dutton gave on al-Jazeera</a> led to speculation on Thursday afternoon that the Australian government was about to announce that refugees on Manus Island and Nauru could go to New Zealand. For the first time ever, news editors across the nation said: \u201cWe really must listen to Peter Dutton\u2019s speech at 5pm today.\u201d </p> <p>Turned out Peter seems to still be travelling on the yellow brick road, most likely lost somewhere in the haunted forest. At least he, unlike the asylum seekers, has a hope of getting to Oz one day. </p> <p>Finally, Pauline Hanson played the part of that person who says: \u201cSome of my best friends are Aboriginal.\u201d</p> <p>Sure, she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/14/pauline-hanson-first-speech-senate-calls-for-immigration-ban\">can still divide a nation</a> with her rhetoric (this time about Muslims) and fact-free analysis (this time about China). But 20 years after excoriating Indigenous Australians for their freeloading-off-the-taxpayer lifestyles, Hanson didn\u2019t mention Indigenous people once in her inaugural speech. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/16/stranger-things-in-parliament-this-week-with-varying-doses-of-reality\">Stranger Things in parliament this week, with varying doses of reality | Katharine Murphy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hanson went even farther and embraced \u2013 literally hugged \u2013 Senator Malarndirri McCarthy, a Yanyuwa woman who spoke in her inaugural speech unflinchingly about the disadvantages Aboriginal people face and the need for constitutional recognition. </p> <p>Who\u2019s to say that in 20 years time Hanson won\u2019t be hugging Senator Jihad Dib as she carries on attacking the menace of west Africans or whichever wave of new migrants next rolls her into parliament.</p> <p>Maybe Bewitched got it right: you can change the cast, but the characters stay the same.</p> <p>PS: If I\u2019m right about the Seinfeldian theory, I sincerely hope Turnbull hasn\u2019t seen <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oi68hPMinAI\">The Contest</a>.

Not only did Shorten announce Coalition government policy but he also took a Dixer in question time and junked the last two days of parliament so he could meet the Canadian prime minister. (By the way, I think I speak for a large portion of Australia \u2013 men and women alike \u2013 when I say I understand Shorten\u2019s decision. Given a choice of looking across the chamber at the Coalition frontbench, or across the table at Justin Trudeau, I know where I\u2019d rather be.) The part of the responsible and grown-up treasurer of Australia was played by Scott Morrison. He negotiated in good faith with the opposition to pass the omnibus savings legislation. He also resolved the superannuation debate that had been paralysing his government. I don\u2019t know where the Coalition found this guy, but he\u2019s a vast improvement on their usual treasurer. And the part of Shorten was played by Tanya Plibersek. In Shorten\u2019s absence she led the opposition in question time in what I judged to be an admirable effort. For a brief moment it looked like Peter Dutton would be playing the part of the Tin Man in the Wizard of Oz (you know, he\u2019d discover that he really did have a heart all along). An ambiguous interview Dutton gave on al-Jazeera led to speculation on Thursday afternoon that the Australian government was about to announce that refugees on Manus Island and Nauru could go to New Zealand. For the first time ever, news editors across the nation said: \u201cWe really must listen to Peter Dutton\u2019s speech at 5pm today.\u201d Turned out Peter seems to still be travelling on the yellow brick road, most likely lost somewhere in the haunted forest. At least he, unlike the asylum seekers, has a hope of getting to Oz one day. Finally, Pauline Hanson played the part of that person who says: \u201cSome of my best friends are Aboriginal.\u201d Sure, she can still divide a nation with her rhetoric (this time about Muslims) and fact-free analysis (this time about China). But 20 years after excoriating Indigenous Australians for their freeloading-off-the-taxpayer lifestyles, Hanson didn\u2019t mention Indigenous people once in her inaugural speech. Hanson went even farther and embraced \u2013 literally hugged \u2013 Senator Malarndirri McCarthy, a Yanyuwa woman who spoke in her inaugural speech unflinchingly about the disadvantages Aboriginal people face and the need for constitutional recognition. Who\u2019s to say that in 20 years time Hanson won\u2019t be hugging Senator Jihad Dib as she carries on attacking the menace of west Africans or whichever wave of new migrants next rolls her into parliament. Maybe Bewitched got it right: you can change the cast, but the characters stay the same. PS: If I\u2019m right about the Seinfeldian theory, I sincerely hope Turnbull hasn\u2019t seen The Contest. Go ahead, dear readers, and write your own punchline. I\u2019m a former premier, for god\u2019s sake. I\u2019m trying to preserve some dignity here.",

It is based on two simple things, trust and mutual respect. In the 25 years I have worked with, fought with and struggled together with, Kim Carr has never broken his word to me. In any walk of life that is the measure of a man.\u201d</p> <p>Conroy has known Shorten since 1986. In his valedictory, Conroy said of their relationship: \u201cWe have been friends, rivals and frenemies.</p> <p>\u201cHe should never be underestimated. Malcolm Turnbull learned that on 2 July this year. Tony Abbott learned it on 14 September last year. The Canberra press gallery has still not learned it but they will.\u201d </p> <p>The resignation blindsided Labor\u2019s acting leader, Tanya Plibersek, on Friday, and NSW frontbencher Anthony Albanese was peppered with questions at a press conference later in the morning.</p> <p>Albanese said he had spoken to Conroy during the morning and was \u201ccertainly not surprised\u201d by his decision.</p> <p>\u201cI know that the greatest joy in Stephen\u2019s life has been the arrival of [daughter] Bella and he will now have more time to spend with his wife and daughter. That is what he wants to do. That is a personal decision. He is perfectly entitled to make that decision,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Conroy\u2019s wife Paula, a survivor of ovarian cancer, was left unable to have children. In 2006 the couple embarked on what was then an Australian first, conceiving their daughter via a surrogate mother and an egg donor.</p> <p>In his valedictory, Conroy cited as one of the factors driving him to exit politics \u201cthe intangibles \u2013 coping with the coverage in the media, especially as the 24/7 media cycle has changed the nature of political discourse\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cNoting the glances and scowls as you walk down the street together. Explaining to my young daughter why people have shouted abuse at her daddy in the street. Being immediately judged as you explain what your partner does or who he is based on the media image.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/15/turnbull-government-launches-sweeping-inquiry-into-donations\">Turnbull government launches sweeping inquiry into donations</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you would all agree that there should be a special place in hell for those who judge women based on their spouse\u2019s work. Paula has remained steadfast in her support for me while maintaining her own career, but it is [for] the incredible job she has done in raising our beautiful daughter Isabella while I have been absent that I owe her an undying debt of gratitude.\u201d</p> <p>In his statement on Friday Shorten thanked Conroy for his \u201ctireless contribution to our party and the nation\u201d.</p> <p>He cited Conroy\u2019s achievements including \u201chis vision for a first-rate, fibre National Broadband Network for Australia\u201d and furthering the public interest through his \u201cformidable presence on both sides of the estimates table\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI have spoken to Stephen and he told me he has decided it is time to put his wife and daughter who he loves so much first, I admire and respect his decision.\u201d</p> <p>Shorten described Conroy as one of his oldest friends, a fearless provider of good advice and \u201ca fiercely loyal champion of the Labor party, who has never lacked the courage to do things his own way\u201d. </p> <p>Conroy was shadow special minister of state until his resignation.

          "bodyText": "Stephen Conroy, Labor\u2019s deputy Senate leader and one of Bill Shorten\u2019s most valuable factional allies, is leaving politics. Conroy has been in parliament since 1996, serving on the Labor frontbench predominantly in the communications portfolio. Conroy has told colleagues he wants to spend more time with his wife Paula and daughter Isabella. His departure from politics comes in the middle of continuing controversy over the police investigation into leaks from the NBN Co, which are the subject of investigation by the privileges committee. Conroy, who was returned at the 2 July election for a new six-year term, did not telegraph his intentions to most colleagues before tabling a valedictory speech in the Senate late on Thursday evening. Shorten, in Canada visiting prime minister Justin Trudeau, released a statement on Friday heaping praise on Conroy. He said he had spoken to him and respected the decision to spend more time with his family. Conroy, with the Victorian left powerbroker Kim Carr, maintains a stability pact which has been critical to underpinning Shorten\u2019s leadership of the ALP. In his farewell speech, Conroy paid tribute to Carr, whom he characterised as a \u201cmuch maligned, a passionate advocate for unfashionable economic policies \u2013 but a Labor warrior\u201d. \u201cIf there was a tough battle in the Senate and you needed a wingman, you would always want Kim Carr next to you,\u201d Conroy said. \u201cPeople have always misunderstood our relationship. It is based on two simple things, trust and mutual respect. In the 25 years I have worked with, fought with and struggled together with, Kim Carr has never broken his word to me. In any walk of life that is the measure of a man.\u201d Conroy has known Shorten since 1986. In his valedictory, Conroy said of their relationship: \u201cWe have been friends, rivals and frenemies. \u201cHe should never be underestimated. Malcolm Turnbull learned that on 2 July this year. Tony Abbott learned it on 14 September last year. The Canberra press gallery has still not learned it but they will.\u201d The resignation blindsided Labor\u2019s acting leader, Tanya Plibersek, on Friday, and NSW frontbencher Anthony Albanese was peppered with questions at a press conference later in the morning. Albanese said he had spoken to Conroy during the morning and was \u201ccertainly not surprised\u201d by his decision. \u201cI know that the greatest joy in Stephen\u2019s life has been the arrival of [daughter] Bella and he will now have more time to spend with his wife and daughter. That is what he wants to do. That is a personal decision. He is perfectly entitled to make that decision,\u201d he said. Conroy\u2019s wife Paula, a survivor of ovarian cancer, was left unable to have children. In 2006 the couple embarked on what was then an Australian first, conceiving their daughter via a surrogate mother and an egg donor. In his valedictory, Conroy cited as one of the factors driving him to exit politics \u201cthe intangibles \u2013 coping with the coverage in the media, especially as the 24/7 media cycle has changed the nature of political discourse\u201d. \u201cNoting the glances and scowls as you walk down the street together. Explaining to my young daughter why people have shouted abuse at her daddy in the street. Being immediately judged as you explain what your partner does or who he is based on the media image. \u201cI\u2019m sure you would all agree that there should be a special place in hell for those who judge women based on their spouse\u2019s work. Paula has remained steadfast in her support for me while maintaining her own career, but it is [for] the incredible job she has done in raising our beautiful daughter Isabella while I have been absent that I owe her an undying debt of gratitude.\u201d In his statement on Friday Shorten thanked Conroy for his \u201ctireless contribution to our party and the nation\u201d. He cited Conroy\u2019s achievements including \u201chis vision for a first-rate, fibre National Broadband Network for Australia\u201d and furthering the public interest through his \u201cformidable presence on both sides of the estimates table\u201d. \u201cI have spoken to Stephen and he told me he has decided it is time to put his wife and daughter who he loves so much first, I admire and respect his decision.\u201d Shorten described Conroy as one of his oldest friends, a fearless provider of good advice and \u201ca fiercely loyal champion of the Labor party, who has never lacked the courage to do things his own way\u201d. Conroy was shadow special minister of state until his resignation. This week, the joint standing committee on electoral matters has launched a fresh inquiry into Australia\u2019s donations and disclosure regime. As his resignation takes immediate effect, Shorten will have to replace Conroy in the shadow ministry and appoint a new deputy Senate leader before parliament resumes. Labor will also have to replace Conroy in the Senate. Conroy is understood to be bound for a corporate job.",

He told the Guardian he believed the Lib Dems could challenge the Conservatives in constituencies, including those they once held in the West Country,where a leftwing Labour party is likely to struggle. \u201cThe only plausible route for the Conservatives to lose their majority at the next election is Liberal Democrats gaining seats, not just in the West Country, but that would be part of it. There is no route for the Labour party to gain seats of any kind, and certainly there is no business model at all for a Labour majority \u2013 even under a moderate, electable leader.\u201d Voters punished the Lib Dems for their decision to enter coalition with David Cameron \u2013 and in particular for backing increases in student tuition fees, which they had promised during the election campaign to reject. But Farron said he hoped the party could \u201cdo a Trudeau\u201d and emulate the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, whose Liberal party beat the official opposition in last year\u2019s election. Failing that, Farron aspires to repeat the success of one of his predecessors, Lord Ashdown, in rebuilding Lib Dem support. \u201cI\u2019ve been serious about us shaping up and doing a Trudeau, but the minimum we can do is an Ashdown \u2013 in other words take a swath of seats that the Tories can\u2019t lose to anyone else and that is the only plausible route arithmetically of getting rid of a Tory government,\u201d he said. \u201cLabour are not going to take 100 seats, there may be one seat on boundaries, maybe a seat in Scotland, but that\u2019s your lot, but it looks to me we could make gains and take Conservatives into minority territory.\u201d Asked whether he could ever see the Lib Dems going into coalition with the Conservatives again, Farron said there were \u201call sorts of different options\u201d. He first encountered May when the pair stood against each other in the safe Labour seat of Durham in 1992, and recalled her as \u201cvery competent, very serious, very businesslike\u201d. But he said she had faced few major choices at the Home Office, and the lack of a credible opposition could tempt her to lurch to the populist right. \u201cThe grammar [schools] stuff says quite a bit about what she\u2019s really like. Maybe she is too influenced by spin doctors \u2013 that\u2019s a very short-termist policy for someone who is usually more grown up than that.\u201d He added that the Conservatives could now become a \u201cgovernment fuelled by the hubris of not having a proper opposition\u201d.",

It drops the $500,000 lifetime cap and makes a number of other changes while still reining in some of the more generous tax concessions. Financial services minister Kelly O\u2019Dwyer did a lot of the backbench negotiating while Scott Morrison did the shoulder charging. Both ministers challenged Labor to support the changes in question time but Chris Bowen was not ready to approve it. Labor of course have their own package which does broadly similar things. But given the Coalition tried to sneak a few other measures into the budget omnibus bill, he wants to see the fine print first. <br></strong></li> <li><strong>The super compromise was a win for government but it still has to pass the parliament and that needs Labor\u2019s support. But the win did increase Coalition confidence in question time, as evidenced by Mike Bowers photos. Turnbull rejected the characterisation as a backflip, saying policies needed to change and respond to circumstances. He said the government would consider ideas from any quarter, even Labor. Leader of government business, Christopher Pyne followed up, saying the Labor\u2019s divisive rhetoric was so last parliament. Remember that one under Tony Abbott?<br></strong></li> <li><strong>The budget omnibus bill went to the Senate today and after the motion by Labor and the Coalition to extend the hours for the day, senators will be forced to sit until the bill passes. The Greens are objecting mightily, having wanted to get the bill to a Senate inquiry. <br></strong></li> <li><strong>Attorney general George Brandis will have to submit to a Senate inquiry into the circumstances around his direction that any requests for legal advice from the solicitor general must come through his office. This will be a very interesting fishing exercise.<br></strong></li> <li><strong>Bill Shorten is still in Canada with Justin. Trudeau, not Beiber. </strong><br></li> </ul> <p>That\u2019s it from me.

The government said that we had it wrong. Scott Morrison, Kelly O\u2019Dwyer said we didn\u2019t understand superannuation by dropping those measures. Today, they have dropped one of the measures themselves.</p> </blockquote> <p>Bowen and <strong>Katy Gallagher</strong>, the financial services minister, want to go through the fine detail, given the Coalition asked Labor to tick off the budget bill sight unseen, only to find errors and other unexpected measures. </p> <p><strong>Bowen</strong>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Labor party has led this debate. We have remained consistent all the way through. This is the latest backflip on superannuation from this treasurer who is simply not up to the job. If the treasurer is consistent with policy making, if he is consistent with his objectives, you will get consistent policy ... The Labor party has shown consistently that we are bipartisan in the national interest where we can.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-15T02:35:35.983Z\">at 3.35am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57da00cbe4b0e813b694d243\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-15T02:00:53.818Z\">3.00am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/tihrigby/status/776230326251036672\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"fr\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/murpharoo\">@murpharoo</a> vegemite, avocado and hommus</p>&mdash; Emisto Enasel Istom (@tihrigby) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tihrigby/status/776230326251036672\">September 15, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57da0095e4b067ad30087d77\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-15T02:00:01.761Z\">3.00am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/propertyofKJ/status/776222300316114944\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/murpharoo\">@murpharoo</a> Marriage equality, marriage equality, a fountain of wine or chocolate</p>&mdash; K\u274cJ (@propertyofKJ) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/propertyofKJ/status/776222300316114944\">September 15, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57da0072e4b0e813b694d240\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-15T01:59:27.688Z\">2.59am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Darthspoog/status/776221174632067072\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/murpharoo\">@murpharoo</a> No more racism, heaps more tolerance and care and support for the disadvantaged....I&#39;m under no illusions that it&#39;s even possible</p>&mdash; Brian Jones (@Darthspoog) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Darthspoog/status/776221174632067072\">September 15, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57da004be4b05caf65ecd511\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-15T01:58:48.928Z\">2.58am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Smash_Bash_Ash/status/776226201375387649\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/murpharoo\">@murpharoo</a> Equality in health and education for all children; an end to racism and bigotry; a Parliament House built out of lamingtons.</p>&mdash; Ashleigh Smith (@Smash_Bash_Ash) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Smash_Bash_Ash/status/776226201375387649\">September 15, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57da0019e4b067ad30087d74\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-15T01:57:54.951Z\">2.57am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/dtsmith_sydney/status/776226770387251200\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/murpharoo\">@murpharoo</a> 1.

But first a quick comment about superannuation.</p> <p>The need to rein in the Howard governments overly generous superannuation concessions has been long and loudly noted by economists for many years. <strong>Scott Morrison and Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s</strong> willingness to grab this bull by the horns should be congratulated. Labor\u2019s superannuation package, which was released by <strong>Chris Bowen</strong> a fair while before the Coalition\u2019s package, should also be congratulated. Bowen essentially gave Morrison cover to work up superannuation reforms which could make a difference to the budget and get rid of a significant tax shelter. As Morrison said, people were stacking money into balances up to $100m paying no tax. Larf! </p> <p>Now you could say, Morrison should have run it past his own backbench before the budget to make for a neater policy package. It certainly would have saved a bit of angst and removed a stick for <strong>Eric Abetz</strong>. But hey, the broader point remains. If the generous concessions for largely high-income earners are wound back for the good of the budget and the savings figures are correct, <strong>Morrison and Turnbull done good</strong>. (All nuclear explosions kept to the comments thread, please.)</p> <p>Bowen will be out at midday. Morrison says he has spoken to him.

Can you understand, though, why most people would think that $100,000 a year out of after-tax income, is an extraordinarily high amount to enable someone to contribute to super out of their own pocket. Almost no one could do that. Is the limit a little high?</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m no enemy of aspiration by Australians and what we\u2019ve said is that we have established a transfer balance cap of $1.6m in this package which we announced on budget night. You know, as well as I do, that only about 1% of people get to that, even under the generous concessions that have particularly been in place since 2007 \u2026</p> <p>And when you could have $180,000 a year with three-year bring forwards and you could keep rolling it in three years after three years after three years we had balances in this country on superannuation in excess of $5m, $10m, $50m, $100m. That is the product of a previous set of arrangements. </p> <p>That will have a legacy to it, understandably. But at the same time what we\u2019ve said here is you can make those after-tax contributions but once you hit $1.6m, that\u2019s great. <strong>I think \u2026 there are many great achievements in life. </strong><strong>Raising your children, paying off your home and providing for yourself in your retirement.

While some may call me a latte-sipping elite, I am no stranger to communities in the back blocks. I live in a small town and live among some people who for various reasons share some of the views of <strong>Pauline Hanson</strong>. Some vote for her.</p> <p>I heard those views just prior to Hanson winning a seat in 1996. I had just moved out of the city and at that time, she was an anathema to me because I considered her and her supporters ignorant. Since coming to know the people in regional Australia, I don\u2019t think of her supporters in that way. They have issues which they want to see ventilated and putting a lid on them will not make them go away. Conversations help.</p> <p>But there is a difference between then and now, though the messages are similar. I covered that 1996 speech when she said Indigenous Australians were getting special benefits and we were being swamped by Asians. Now we are being swamped by Muslims, who are taking benefits, and the Asians, having done too well, are buying all our land. As <strong>Penny Wong</strong> said this morning, if she was around in the 50s it would have been the Greeks and Italians. I predict the Sudanese will come into focus in the future.<br></p> <p>The difference as I see it is this. In 1996, Hanson was unformed, politically naive, channelling views she heard in her family and in her community. The political process and Svengalis got a hold of her, chucked her in jail for a bit and she has emerged out the other side a different person. Strategic. Polished. That speech last night was a result. Deliberately hitting the same notes but choosing different victims. Smirking as the Greens staged their ill-advised walkout. As <strong>Tony Burke</strong> said she is not dumb, this was a deliberate, damaging, illogical but incendiary intervention. As much as I railed in 1996, I prefer that version. Pauline Hanson 2.0, in this security environment, has much more capacity for damage. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-14T23:42:34.389Z\">at 12.42am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57d9cf64e4b067ad30087c9e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-14T22:36:37.144Z\">11.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>If you are looking around for powerful first speeches, check this one out.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muNKv2QttTY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/muNKv2QttTY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Julian Leeser, new MP for Berowra, gives his first speech.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Leeser won the safe Liberal seat after <strong>Philip Ruddock</strong> retired. </p> <p>It\u2019s the personal experiences I think which shape the best first speeches.

The government trumpeted its reworked superannuation package, that passed cabinet last night and was given the big tick of approval by former critics, George Christensen among others. It drops the $500,000 lifetime cap and makes a number of other changes while still reining in some of the more generous tax concessions. Financial services minister Kelly O\u2019Dwyer did a lot of the backbench negotiating while Scott Morrison did the shoulder charging. Both ministers challenged Labor to support the changes in question time but Chris Bowen was not ready to approve it. Labor of course have their own package which does broadly similar things. But given the Coalition tried to sneak a few other measures into the budget omnibus bill, he wants to see the fine print first. The super compromise was a win for government but it still has to pass the parliament and that needs Labor\u2019s support. But the win did increase Coalition confidence in question time, as evidenced by Mike Bowers photos. Turnbull rejected the characterisation as a backflip, saying policies needed to change and respond to circumstances. He said the government would consider ideas from any quarter, even Labor. Leader of government business, Christopher Pyne followed up, saying the Labor\u2019s divisive rhetoric was so last parliament. Remember that one under Tony Abbott? The budget omnibus bill went to the Senate today and after the motion by Labor and the Coalition to extend the hours for the day, senators will be forced to sit until the bill passes. The Greens are objecting mightily, having wanted to get the bill to a Senate inquiry. Attorney general George Brandis will have to submit to a Senate inquiry into the circumstances around his direction that any requests for legal advice from the solicitor general must come through his office. This will be a very interesting fishing exercise. Bill Shorten is still in Canada with Justin. Trudeau, not Beiber. That\u2019s it from me. Thanks to the brains trust, Katharine Murphy, Paul Karp, Gareth Hutchens and Mike Bowers. Thanks for your company this week. We are not sitting until October 10, so I will be back here, driving the bus on that very day. Goodnight. The ejections. Husic. Husar. Feeney. Have a go ya mug. F-f-f-f-f-finance. The Greens\u2019 treasury spokesman, Peter Whish-Wilson, says Scott Morrison caved in on the superannuation package. Today the government caved in on the substantial reforms needed to address the perversities in the superannuation system that allow the wealthy to use their superannuation as a tax haven. The Greens estimate superannuation concessions cost Australian tax payers nearly $30bn per annum. The government is only proposing to cut these by 10%. Whilst some concessions are necessary to incentivise savings, many are simply used by the wealthy to minimise tax, which means less money for our schools and healthcare. Meanwhile, in the Northern Territory, the Country Liberals have released their shadow cabinet positions. Playing it for the lols. This explains the last post. My football consultant, Mike Bowers, tells me the Western Bulldogs are playing the Hawks. They are revving up Bill Shorten. While he is away in Canada. Demotion looms. Is there a football game happening somewhere? Now that the flurry of question time is over, I can post Gareth Hutchen\u2019s analysis of the unemployment figures: The latest unemployment figure is out today, and the headline number looks good. The unemployment rate fell last month to 5.6%, seasonally adjusted, from 5.7%. It hasn\u2019t been this low since September 2013. Not bad, eh? The government hasn\u2019t been trumpeting the news today because the story is complicated. Firstly, the seasonally adjusted number can be unreliable. It can jump around a lot. The trend figure provides the best measure of the underlying behaviour of the labour market and it has been stuck at 5.7% since May. Secondly, underemployment keeps increasing. Since December last year, there are about 105,300 more people working part-time, but the number of people working full time has decreased by 21,500. In fact, the trend underemployment rate \u2013 a quarterly measure of employed people who would like to work more hours \u2013 hit 8.6% last month, the highest it has ever been. There is a question to the industry minister, Greg Hunt, on the current state of negotiations as to the sale of Arrium\u2019s assets and what could we possibly do to ensure its survival. Hunt says the first shipment from this steel plant for the Adelaide to Tarcoola railway line was delivered. That is a tremendous step forward. That should deliver $80m of cash flow for the plant and for the future of the Whyalla steel plant. Labor asks the prime minister: Is the PM aware that Gina Rinehart offered $175m for a charitable cancer centre in Darwin but has withdrawn that after as a response to the defeat of Adam Giles as chief minister. Will the PM undertake to ask Gina Rinehart directly or through her adviser Sophie Mirabella to [honour] her original commitment in the interests of cancer sufferers in the NT? Speaker Smith rules the question out of order. Labor through Tony Burke and Anthony Albanese ask the Speaker to allow the second half of the question. That is that the PM make representations on the issue. Speaker won\u2019t budge. He advises Solomon MP Luke Gosling to raise the matter in other forums such as the adjournment debate. A question to the urban infrastructure minister, Paul Fletcher: During the election the Turnbull government announced a $210m dollar commitment to upgrade the M1 Pacific motorway. Will the government reconfirm this commitment and what steps he is taking to ensure the people of the Logan and Gold Coast see this upgrade happen? In Senate question time the attorney general, George Brandis, has denied having any conversations with the prime minister, foreign minister or other members of cabinet about receiving an overseas appointment or a judicial appointment. Brandis is rumoured to covet an appointment to the high court, which he is not expected to be offered but he has been tipped to become Australia\u2019s next high commissioner in London. Asked to rule out taking a judicial or overseas appointment before the end of his current Senate term, Brandis replied: You know Senator [Catryna] Bilyk I thought the day would never come when I would enjoy a question from you but that day has come at last \u2013 yes I can rule that out. Labor asks Scott Morrison why he wants a superannuation policy that saves $1bn less than the Labor superannuation package. See previous Morrison answers. The agriculture minister, Barnaby Joyce, gets a question on the rural women awards, which were on last night. He outlines the achievements of all the state finalists and the winner, Sophie Hanson from New South Wales. Chris Bowen to Scott Morrison: In question time yesterday, the treasurer said of the government\u2019s superannuation package, we continue to pursue those superannuation measures because they are essential. Given the government abandoned those measures a few hours ago can the treasurer explain to the House why they were essential yesterday but not today? Morrison says Labor made changes to their own superannuation policy after the election. [Labor has] the opportunity to do [support] that and I look forward to them doing that because they know they\u2019re going to support it. We know they\u2019re going to support it and the Australian people just want them to get on with it. A government question to Sussan Ley, the health minister, regarding reforms around medicine listing. Today, the government announced that we are taking action to bring medicines and medical devices to Australia faster. We found our expert panel has found that it\u2019s taking up to two years to get listings from the US or Europe here to Australia. Ley doesn\u2019t actually say what the changes are but, rather, that Labor failed to do anything. I will have to track this down. A question to Michael McCormack, the small biz minister: Will the minister inform the House of the findings of the inquiry into the effect of the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal\u2019s payments order on Australian small businesses? (see the Paul Karp post earlier.) Then another Labor question to O\u2019Dwyer: In question time yesterday, the minister said of the government\u2019s superannuation package, \u201cWe announced it in the budget. We believe in our superannuation package.\u201d Does the minister believe in the superannuation package announced today or does the minister believe in the superannuation package she believed in yesterday? I do note that at a time when he was the treasurer, at a time when he was the treasurer he didn\u2019t embark upon superannuation reform. He embarked upon increasing superannuation taxes, that was it. No reform. No flexibility. No ability for people to contribute more to their superannuation. We believe very strongly in our superannuation package on this side of the House because we know that it will help average Australians. The financial services minister, Kelly O\u2019Dwyer, gets a Labor question: Yesterday, was the minister aware she was ridiculing a superannuation measure that the cabinet was set to adopt just hours later? Or was the member for Dawson yet to advise the minister of the government\u2019s new superannuation policy? O\u2019Dwyer quotes Industry Super Australia, the Financial Services Council and the Australian Superannuation Funds of Australia saying favourable things about the super reform package. So frankly we cannot understand why those opposite are going through this charade of pretending that they are not going to support our policy changes when they know that they are right for the Australian people and they are right for the budget. A government question to Christopher Pyne: Will the minister inform the House of the steps the government is taking to support emergency services volunteers? How are these measures and other achievements of the government proving that we are implementing our commitments to the Australian people? Even Christopher Pyne is feeling the love. He says the government will work with anyone who wants to work with them. Labor, Greens, crossbenchers, the Coalition will take on all comers. This is the 45th parliament now, not the 44th \u2013 brackets \u2013 run by Tony Abbott \u2013 close brackets. We will work with them because the most important thing that we can all do as parliamentarians is make the lives of Australians better, make our country and our economy and our society better. So those members of the Labor party want to be so last 44th parliament, let me say to them, we are in a new parliament and the parliament is working. The parliament is working. And if you intend to continue with the same tactics that you had for so many years is so pass and as the minister says if you want to continue with that the public will mark them down. Let\u2019s work together to make our country great again . Ch for Christopher and Ch for Chutzpah. Kelly O\u2019Dwyer, the financial services minister, gets a question on superannuation. Then Labor to Turnbull: Today Senator Abetz issued a press release claiming credit for the PM\u2019s humiliating backdown on superannuation. Are the extreme elements of his party so powerful that they can force the PM to abandon his absolutely ironclad promise? What happened to the PM\u2019s absolutely ironclad promise? I am happy for every member of the Coalition party room to claim credit for every decision of the government. And the truth is it\u2019s a team business. It\u2019s a team business. Of course, very often members are too modest to do that but I think it\u2019s good and I want every member of the Coalition party room \u2013 House and Senate \u2013 to claim credit for the government\u2019s decisions. (This is trolling Abetz more than Labor.) He then goes on: We\u2019re going through what I describe as the pantomime of politics, which is one of the reasons her constituents and my constituents, all of our constituents, get fed up with what politicians do and say. So a government improves a measure, consults, changes it, improves it, makes it work better. In the real world ... people say that is good. They listen. They listen and they tweaked it and they made a change. Good on them. They listened to us, it\u2019s sensible ... I say to the honourable member if she believes any of our measures can be improved, she should let us know. We will look on what she says in good faith. Labor\u2019s Jim Charlton asks Turnbull: The member for Dawson said about the PM\u2019s humiliating super backdown today, \u201cWe put forward all our views and they listened and they acted ... What happened to the PM\u2019s absolutely ironclad promise? Isn\u2019t it the case that the member for Dawson and the extreme elements of his party are now in charge of the government\u2019s economic policy?\u201d Charlton, Wayne Swan\u2019s former adviser, has a PhD in economics. Turnbull makes a (cheap) crack about his doctorate, \u201cI\u2019d ask him where his PhD in economics has gone too\u201d. But then goes point out an \u201cimportant principle\u201d of his government. We will seek always to improve our measures. If measures we propose or implement can be improved, we will improve them. We will listen to all those who offer criticism or suggestions for change, we will listen to them in good faith, if we can improve measures we will improve them. We have to recognise the policy-making must be dynamic. Scott Morrison is rather cocky too \u2013 challenging Labor to support the package \u2013 so Tony Burke asks him to table to bill. Labor is waiting to see the details and do not believe the details until they see it. After the omnibus bill experience. Scott Morrison gets a Dixer on superannuation. Meanwhile, up in the Senate: The Greens\u2019 disabilities spokeswoman, Rachel Siewert, has identified a \u201cmean-spirited\u201d proposal to remove backdating of carer\u2019s allowances in the omnibus savings bill. The saving is worth $108.6m over four years and is an element of the Coalition and Labor\u2019s $6.3bn budget savings compromise, being debated in the Senate today. Under current rules when a person unexpectedly becomes a carer due to a sudden injury or worsening condition of a loved one, they can have their carer\u2019s allowance backdated. The maximum amount available is 12 weeks\u2019 of payments, or $741. She said: Carers provide an a huge amount of care and support nationally, the government is taking this group for granted in moving to legislate this cut as part of the omnibus bill. Bob Katter asks Scott Morrison about pensioner incomes and whether there should be an increased tax on imports to pay more to pensioners. Morrison says, with great respect to the member, no. If you do that then what you are doing is you increase the costs to produce things in this country because our businesses make those imports. Now, if you\u2019re going to increase the costs on business in this country, whether it\u2019s by that measure or by increasing taxes, like those opposite want to do on business, then what you end up doing is costing incomes and jobs. Fun fact: That was a 45-second question from Katter. Crossbenchers get an extra 15 seconds under the rule changes that went through on Tuesday night. Bowen to Turnbull: My question is for the prime minister. Can the prime minister confirm in June he was asked about superannuation and can you foresee any circumstance in which the policy is detailed following the election? The prime minister responded that it was absolutely ironclad. How can the prime minister claimed to lead a country when even his absolutely ironclad promises can\u2019t survive the extreme elements of his own party? Turnbull is looking cocky now. He appears to be enjoying himself. My government took it out of that [hard] basket ... the opposition urged us to make changes, many others did too, we listened to them and made some changes. The honourable member says, I listened to George [Christensen]. He may as well have said I listen to him, he may as well say we listen to everyone, because we consult, we listen, we consult and then we make decisions based on the public interest. Malcolm Turnbull gets a Dixer on national security. He foreshadows his upcoming trip to the US with meetings in New York with world leaders to discuss the security and humanitarian challenges posed by the uncontrolled movement of 65m people \u201cwho were forcibly displaced around the world, many from the Syrian conflict\u201d. (The comments from Dutton in the earlier post regarding New Zealand may be a shot over the bow before this refugee meeting in New York.) Plibersek to Turnbull: The PM was asked what was your greatest achievement since being PM and the PM responded the reforms in superannuation, the reforms in business tax. Today he\u2019s junked both. What is the point of the Turnbull government if the PM can\u2019t even deliver on his so-called greatest achievements? The acting opposition leader\u2019s question underlined, demonstrated as if on cue the very point I just made ...[Labor] love to talk about fairness. The problem is they don\u2019t practise what they preach. They did nothing about superannuation when they were in government. The only approach they have to equity is self-help. That is the Dastyari approach. The government question to Malcolm Turnbull is on superannuation. It is a great outcome he says and then gives Labor a lecture. With a little less grandstanding, a little less name calling and a little bit more constructive negotiation, we can achieve great things for Australians and their future in this 45th parliament. The first question from Tanya Plibersek to Malcolm Turnbull: why has the government not established a redress scheme for victims of institutional child sexual abuse? Turnbull says its complicated but we are working our way through it. Minister for social services is working with state governments \u201cto ensure that redress is provided\u201d and that is a \u201cnationally consistent\u201d approach. When Labor fires up, he gets indignant. I would say to the member opposite, there is no monopoly on empathy, we understand the problem. We are working through it sensitively with those affected, with the institutions and with governments to ensure that justice is done. Question time coming up people. A visual representation of Scott Morrison negotiating with his party room. The ABC has reported comments from immigration minister Peter Dutton in an interview with al-Jazeera. Lest I verbal him, here they are: We have had people smugglers that have tried to send boats across the top of Australia to New Zealand before. Let me make this very important point that people \u2013 if they\u2019ve sought to come by boat \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter where they\u2019re resettled, New Zealand or somewhere else, they will not be coming to Australia at any point. This would appear to leave the way open to the option of resettling asylum seekers currently on Nauru. Previously, the government has characterised New Zealand as being too good a country. (My words.) Or rather, a back door way of getting into Australia as Peter Dutton said earlier this year. Is a deal looming? We are checking. The Coalition\u2019s superannuation package has finally come down from the mountain. This is the reworked deal after the conservative backbench revolt over the $500,000 lifetime cap on non-concessional contributions. The lifetime cap has been dropped, among other things. Labor has said it would look at the detail but it was a backflip. Bowen would be looking at this closely, given Labor came out with its own reforms to wind back overly generous tax concessions ahead of the Coalition. But I suspect he is not going to give the government two compromises in one week. Various people including Liberal, Labor, the Greens, Nick Xenophon and many others have condemned Pauline Hanson\u2019s anti-Muslim, anti-Asian, anti-immigration, anti-welfare, anti-anti speech. Unemployment figures have declined slightly in August but my economics whiz, Gareth Hutchens, tells me it is in line with the trend. He will add a little more nuance in a post shortly. The Coalition and Labor have combined to extend the Senate sitting hours to push the budget omnibus bill through today. We may have a marathon sitting ahead of us tonight. Labor has forced a legal affairs committee Senate inquiry on the attorney general, George Brandis, over his moves to have all requests for government legal advice come through his office. In an opinion piece for Guardian Australia published on Thursday, Alan Joyce, the Qantas chief executive, has taken a stand against the marriage equality plebiscite, the first time the leader of a major corporation has rejected the government\u2019s mechanism for same-sex marriage. The Greens wanted the $6.3bn budget omnibus bill to go to inquiry. Richard Di Natale is cranky about forcing the Senate to consider the bill in a day. Now, here we are, after this government has spent the first two days of the parliament filibustering, talking about God knows what, and we\u2019re being asked to stay here to ram this bill through the parliament tonight. We may be in for a late night. Labor and the Coalition have voted together to extend the Senate sitting hours tonight to get the omnibus bill through. We will not know until later how long it will take because anyone who wants to speak on the bill can speak. There is no cut-off rule in the Senate. It\u2019s how they roll. More in sorrow than in anger, Labor says maybe to the Coalition\u2019s superannuation compromise. From AAP: Malcolm Turnbull has been given another gift for the anniversary of his first year as prime minister \u2013 the lowest jobless rate in three years. The unemployment rate unexpectedly declined to 5.6% in August when economists had expected it to stay at 5.7%, as fewer people sought a job. The fall came despite overall employment dropping by 3,900 in the month as 11,500 new full-time workers was more than offset by a decline in part-time positions. Goodbye John. Senate news. Labor has successfully forced a Senate inquiry into the moves by the attorney general, George Brandis, to stop the solicitor general providing independent legal advice without his prior approval. The legal and constitutional affairs references committee will conduct the inquiry. The employment minister, Michaelia Cash, the small business minister, Michael McCormack, and the transport minister, Darren Chester, have launched a report about the effect of the road safety remuneration tribunal. That tribunal set minimum rates that truck owner-drivers had to charge to ensure they weren\u2019t lowly paid and incentivised to skip breaks. It was abolished in April over concerns it would put the drivers out of work, because they could not compete with employees. The report claims the order \u2013 which was only in effect for two weeks and was never enforced \u2013 caused \u201ca devastating personal and economic\u201d impact on owner-drivers. Cash said the report included \u201cevidence from the owner-drivers themselves that the work was drying up, there would literally be nothing left for them on the day the order came into force\u201d. This report now confirms in black and white that is exactly what occurred \u2013 lives were devastated. Asked how the report could claim hardship was due to the order rather than conditions in the industry, including low pay before the order, Cash said that owner-drivers reported they were \u201calready being told they would not have jobs\u201d. She denied that this constituted anecdotal evidence. Bowen is asked about Labor banking the Coalition\u2019s $3bn superannuation savings before the election and then revealing the full detail of their package, which was worth $4.5bn savings after the election. [Before the election] I said, the government will drop the $500,000 cap after the election. We are prepared to find ways of making that money. I believe we\u2019ve been proven right in this debate at every turn, every step of the way in the public discussion. The government has lurched from policy to policy, from crisis to crisis on this. Chris Bowen has started his press conference criticising Scott Morrison. But he says he will take up the government\u2019s offer of a briefing. A few weeks ago Bill Shorten, Katy and I outlined a better plan for superannuation, a constructive plan to help the government through their mess, drop the retrospective cap, reduce the contributions for threshold tax for $200,000, the catch-up measure and harmonising contribution rules between 65 and74. The government said that we had it wrong. Scott Morrison, Kelly O\u2019Dwyer said we didn\u2019t understand superannuation by dropping those measures. Today, they have dropped one of the measures themselves. Bowen and Katy Gallagher, the financial services minister, want to go through the fine detail, given the Coalition asked Labor to tick off the budget bill sight unseen, only to find errors and other unexpected measures. Bowen: The Labor party has led this debate. We have remained consistent all the way through. This is the latest backflip on superannuation from this treasurer who is simply not up to the job. If the treasurer is consistent with policy making, if he is consistent with his objectives, you will get consistent policy ... The Labor party has shown consistently that we are bipartisan in the national interest where we can. Further to Morrison\u2019s trifecta of Australian dreams, we have had many entries from Twitter. The Institute of Public Affairs is not happy about where the superannuation package landed. Brett Hogan, the director of research at the Institute of Public Affairs: The Turnbull government should be congratulated for dumping its retrospective and unworkable $500,000 lifetime non-concessional contributions cap. However, limits on what can be transferred into a retirement account remain, as does the proposed objective that superannuation exists only to \u2018substitute or supplement the age pension\u2019. Overall, the Turnbull government\u2019s superannuation policy remains ill thought-out and built on a platform of higher taxes.\u201d The debate in Australia today. Is she: Bad Pauline. Good Pauline. Mike Bowers asks, you decide. Knowing me, knowing you. Aha. We are inundated with many suggestions for the trifecta of Australian dreams which I will bring you in a minute. But first a quick comment about superannuation. The need to rein in the Howard governments overly generous superannuation concessions has been long and loudly noted by economists for many years. Scott Morrison and Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s willingness to grab this bull by the horns should be congratulated. Labor\u2019s superannuation package, which was released by Chris Bowen a fair while before the Coalition\u2019s package, should also be congratulated. Bowen essentially gave Morrison cover to work up superannuation reforms which could make a difference to the budget and get rid of a significant tax shelter. As Morrison said, people were stacking money into balances up to $100m paying no tax. Larf! Now you could say, Morrison should have run it past his own backbench before the budget to make for a neater policy package. It certainly would have saved a bit of angst and removed a stick for Eric Abetz. But hey, the broader point remains. If the generous concessions for largely high-income earners are wound back for the good of the budget and the savings figures are correct, Morrison and Turnbull done good. (All nuclear explosions kept to the comments thread, please.) Bowen will be out at midday. Morrison says he has spoken to him. We await with interest but could there be two policy reform handshakes in one week? Lastly \u2013 I promise \u2013 George Christensen gives the prime minister five stars for performance. Malcolm the Movie has exceeded all expectations. He has managed to juggle the party room and come to compromises. He is doing a very good job. When we see decisions like this on superannuation, obviously as PM he has been able to steer that conversation to a landing point which both moderates and conservatives are happy with. Has the PM exceeded your expectations? I think he has. He has been willing to listen to both sides of the fence, not just Nationals and Liberals but conservatives and moderates or progressives within the Liberal-National Coalition and he is doing a very good job at that. I give him full marks. Conservatives are continuing to issue fine print on the outcome of the plebiscite in preparation of a potential yes to marriage equality. Q: If a plebiscite does take place and Australia votes to change the Marriage Act, will you yourself support that in parliament? I will vote how my electorate votes. That is how I will vote. If my electorate votes for same-sex marriage I will cast my vote for it. If my electorate votes against it \u2013 and if every MP voted according to the will of the electorate \u2013 we would have the national mood reflected in this place. George Christensen is also asked about Pauline Hanson\u2019s views on banning Muslim immigration. He does not think Australia is being swamped by Muslims. For instance, Pauline Hanson might say ban all Muslims from immigrating into \u2013 or migrating to Australia. I would say that it probably reflects the concerns of people regarding national security, but do I agree with that? No, I think a more nuanced policy would be to restrict immigration from countries where there is a high level of violent extremism. That would be putting the precautionary principle into place when it comes to national security and using our immigration policy to do that. Christensen says he told the One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts to keep speaking the truth on climate change. I told him keep speaking the truth to the climate mafia. Obviously he has views on the idea of catastrophic man-made climate change being bogus, just like I do. We were on the same page when it comes to that. Christensen is asked about his views on same-sex marriage and polygamy. Will one lead to the other? I will treat the same-sex marriage issue on its own. There are people out there that are almost pushing for polygamy. George Christensen, Liberal National party MP and agitator, is a happy man today. The doing away of the $500,000 non-concessional lifetime cap goes even further that than I would have thought. I would have been happy with a $1m non-concessional cap. Doing away with it is one step better, I suppose that does away also with all the retrospectivity concerns that people had. These were issues that were raised by many, many people in my electorate and also many people in the Liberal and National party membership and base \u2026 This really does seal the deal and as such, I can say I am 100% supportive of the new superannuation reforms that we will take to parliament and I will no longer be crossing the floor, if indeed what has been announced today is what is going to be legislated. Thank you, Matthew. A question from Peter Martin of Fairfax draws out a soliloquy of sorts from the treasurer about the Australian dream. Q: People concerned about the stability of the budget will be applauding this if you get it through, it looks like you will. Can you understand, though, why most people would think that $100,000 a year out of after-tax income, is an extraordinarily high amount to enable someone to contribute to super out of their own pocket. Almost no one could do that. Is the limit a little high? I\u2019m no enemy of aspiration by Australians and what we\u2019ve said is that we have established a transfer balance cap of $1.6m in this package which we announced on budget night. You know, as well as I do, that only about 1% of people get to that, even under the generous concessions that have particularly been in place since 2007 \u2026 And when you could have $180,000 a year with three-year bring forwards and you could keep rolling it in three years after three years after three years we had balances in this country on superannuation in excess of $5m, $10m, $50m, $100m. That is the product of a previous set of arrangements. That will have a legacy to it, understandably. But at the same time what we\u2019ve said here is you can make those after-tax contributions but once you hit $1.6m, that\u2019s great. I think \u2026 there are many great achievements in life. Raising your children, paying off your home and providing for yourself in your retirement. They are a trifecta of Australian dreams that we believe in. A question from the floor to Scott Morrison.. The PM described the changes outlined in the budget as ironclad. They have now been changed. Do you expect that ironclad promise was wrong? What I accept is when you\u2019re in government you have to solve problems, you have to work issues and you have to get to conclusions and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done today. This is more detail from the treasurer\u2019s statement. Individuals with a superannuation balance of more than $1.6m will no longer be eligible to make non-concessional (after tax) contributions from 1 July 2017. This limit will be tied and indexed to the transfer balance cap. This ensures that we focus the entitlement for after tax contributions to those Australians who have an aspiration to maximise their superannuation balances and reach the transfer balance cap in the retirement phase, where a zero tax on earnings applies. These measures mean that with their annual concessional contributions, Australians will be able to contribute $125,000 each year and, if taking advantage of the non-concessional \u2018bring forward\u2019, up to $325,000 in any one year until such time as they reach $1.6m. The treasurer makes the point that Labor should support the package (given it has removed the backdating provision which they opposed). He has called Chris Bowen and offered a briefing. It\u2019s the new caring, sharing Scott Morrison. I commend Mr Bowen this week, I commend Chris on the work he did on the omnibus bill this week. I think it is clear that there are people in Labor, as Chris has demonstrated, we can work with, to come to arrangements like this. It\u2019s really up to whether Mr Shorten is. That\u2019s really what it\u2019s about. He\u2019s demonstrating a greater commitment to opposition than he is to progress but there are members in his own team who I think are trying to go a better way. Naughty ScoMo. Push Bowen. Whack Shorten. The measures were supported \u201cacclamation\u201d in the party room, says the treasurer. Over the past few months, we have been engaging with our colleagues, our Coalition colleagues, on all of these measures. And we have been listening to them as they have been listening to their communities and to their constituents. The new measures, by Scott Morrison, are: Replace the lifetime non-concessional cap with an annual cap of $100,000 with a three-year bring forward, limited to those who have a balance of $1.6m. The cost of reversing the other measure and introducing the new measure is $400m to the budget. In addition to pay for this, we will be reversing the abolition of the work test measures for those aged 65 to 74 and that means the existing arrangements for those who are aged over 65 will continue. That is a saving of $180m. We will also defer commencement of the catch-up concessional contributions by one year to 1 July 2018, which provides a saving over the budget and forward estimates of $400m. That provides a net improvement to the budget of what we announced today of $180m over the forward estimates and some $670m over the medium term. Morrison starts with the purpose of superannuation and a note to Peter Costello, who oversaw the current superannuation system. The purpose of these tax concessions is as outlined by David Murray and that is to provide income in retirement to substitute or supplement the aged pension. That\u2019s what they\u2019re supposed to do. Scott Morrison\u2019s superannuation press conference begins. Richard Di Natale on Sky this morning, defending the Greens\u2019 decision to walk out on the Hanson speech. Phil Coorey of the Fin has the super guff. The federal government has made significant changes to its superannuation package, including dumping plans for a backdated, lifetime cap of $500,000 on non-concessional contributions, in order to win over the backbench and ultimately, the Senate. In a compromise to be put to the party room for approval on Thursday, sources said the $500,000 cap backdated to 2007 had been removed and replaced by a mechanism in which people would be able to make both concessional and non-concessional contributions until the cap of $1.6m in a super retirement account was reached. There will be a yearly cap of $100,000 on non-concessional contributions until the $1.6m is reached. Dumping the $500,000 lifetime cap would cost the budget $550m in revenue over four years. To recoup this, sources said the government had scrapped a proposal to remove restrictions such as minimum work requirements on people aged between 65 and 74 wishing to make voluntary contributions to their super. Let\u2019s just refresh memories about the government\u2019s superannuation proposal that emerged from the 2016 budget. The Coalition policy placed a $500,000 lifetime cap on after-tax superannuation contributions backdated to 2007, increases the concessional tax rate on asset earnings from 0% to 15% for people aged 56 to 65 in the \u201ctransition to retirement\u201d, and taxes accounts over $1.6m at 15%. A number of backbenchers were revolting, on the lifetime cap and the backdating. I am told the cap is gone in a major rejig. Malcolm Turnbull appears to have given an interview to the Financial Review: Prime minister Malcolm Turnbull believes the Senate will pass the two industrial relations bills that triggered the double-dissolution election without the need for a joint sitting of parliament as he indicated the government was prepared to compromise on these measures as well as all other budget bills to secure their passage. In an interview with the Australian Financial Review to mark his first year in office, Mr Turnbull said the government\u2019s singular focus from now until the next election would be on the budget and economic reform and that he would not be distracted by such issues as same-sex marriage. And in Fairfax Media: A defiant Malcolm Turnbull has claimed credit for stronger-than-expected economic growth in the first year of his prime ministership, declaring he deserves a \u201ctick\u201d for delivering economic leadership. The prime minister has also cited his science and innovation agenda as one of the key reasons for higher growth and investment and stronger business confidence, saying it is \u201cdirectly related\u201d to the improvement. Now that I have that off my chest, I can tell you that there is a party-room meeting going on now to tick off changes to the Coalition\u2019s superannuation policy. Cabinet met last night, as did the economics committee. We are told the changes are revenue neutral. More details in a minute. Those who have followed my work will know I have written extensively about the disenfranchised in rural and regional areas. While some may call me a latte-sipping elite, I am no stranger to communities in the back blocks. I live in a small town and live among some people who for various reasons share some of the views of Pauline Hanson. Some vote for her. I heard those views just prior to Hanson winning a seat in 1996. I had just moved out of the city and at that time, she was an anathema to me because I considered her and her supporters ignorant. Since coming to know the people in regional Australia, I don\u2019t think of her supporters in that way. They have issues which they want to see ventilated and putting a lid on them will not make them go away. Conversations help. But there is a difference between then and now, though the messages are similar. I covered that 1996 speech when she said Indigenous Australians were getting special benefits and we were being swamped by Asians. Now we are being swamped by Muslims, who are taking benefits, and the Asians, having done too well, are buying all our land. As Penny Wong said this morning, if she was around in the 50s it would have been the Greeks and Italians. I predict the Sudanese will come into focus in the future. The difference as I see it is this. In 1996, Hanson was unformed, politically naive, channelling views she heard in her family and in her community. The political process and Svengalis got a hold of her, chucked her in jail for a bit and she has emerged out the other side a different person. Strategic. Polished. That speech last night was a result. Deliberately hitting the same notes but choosing different victims. Smirking as the Greens staged their ill-advised walkout. As Tony Burke said she is not dumb, this was a deliberate, damaging, illogical but incendiary intervention. As much as I railed in 1996, I prefer that version. Pauline Hanson 2.0, in this security environment, has much more capacity for damage. If you are looking around for powerful first speeches, check this one out. Leeser won the safe Liberal seat after Philip Ruddock retired. It\u2019s the personal experiences I think which shape the best first speeches. Like Labor\u2019s Anne Aly and Liberal\u2019s Tim Wilson. More coming today. I hope to have a list shortly. A bit of housekeeping. Bills on the program today include: Broadcasting legislation amendment (television and radio licence fees) Higher education support legislation amendment (2016 measures No 1) Offshore petroleum and greenhouse gas storage amendment (petroleum pools and other measures) Treasury laws amendment (income tax relief) Fair work amendment (respect for emergency services volunteers) Building and construction industry (improving productivity) 2013 Building and construction industry (consequential and transitional provisions) 2013 Parliament starts at 9.30am. Good morning, It was a long night after a long day. I had a dream that Malcolm Turnbull was delivering a speech in a yoga pose called firelog \u2013 a decent hip opener with much to recommend it. I think that the very long blog day was messing with my mind. The other thing I was considering was the Pauline Hanson speech. Of course, she went off like a firecracker. And then, so did everyone else. I will have something more to say in a moment but let\u2019s get this baby up and running with a range of reactions. The PM, via Rosie Lewis in the Oz: Senator Hanson knows I do not agree with her views on migration. Australia is the world\u2019s most successful multicultural society and the foundation of that success is mutual respect. Labor\u2019s Penny Wong told Radio National she chose not to attend because Hanson \u201cpeddles prejudice and fear\u201d. There is no community which has been made stronger by prejudice and fear \u2026 by targeting people based on their religion or ethnicity. Her comments don\u2019t make Australia stronger or safer, or Australia a more cohesive society. Wong made the point that if Hanson had been around in the 1950s or 60s she would have targeted Greeks and Italians, then eastern Europeans, then Asians in the 1990s, and today Muslims. I think diversity is a strength. Nick Xenophon said the way Hanson had \u201cvilified\u201d Islamic Australians was \u201cheart-breaking\u201d. This is not what Australia is about \u2013 we are an open, inclusive country. Pauline Hanson is wrong.\u201d The Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, said Hanson\u2019s was an \u201covertly racist, bigoted, divisive speech\u201d. He explained the Greens walked out because \u201cwe didn\u2019t want to dignify it with an audience\u201d. She\u2019s been elected as a member of parliament, she\u2019s got a platform, doesn\u2019t mean we have to stay in there and listen to that garbage. It just got worse and worse, then I think she tried to conflate refugees with terrorists \u2013 and at that point there, our team had had enough. Mikey Bowers is chasing the pollies around the building so we will have more from in a moment. I am @gabriellechan and he is @mpbowers or you can join the conversation on my Facebook page. Party like it\u2019s 1996.",

I need to go and stick my eyeballs in a glass of water and my spirit in a decompression chamber. </p> <p>Today:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The budget omnibus bill - agreed on by the Coalition and Labor - passed through the lower house but not without protests from Greens MP Adam Bandt and Andrew Wilkie. Fellow crossbenchers Cathy McGowan and Bob Katter joined them to oppose the bill. There appeared to be some funny business going on around the $800m put back into the renewable energy agency Arena (which was going to lose $1.3bn). It remains a net loss.<br></strong></li> <li><strong>Malcolm Turnbull introduced the same sex marriage plebiscite bill. Bill Shorten let it be known that he would recommend blocking the bill. But we don\u2019t have it from his mouth because he jetted off to meet Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau. There is some suggestion via Paul Karp that a Coalition briefing note suggests conscientious objectors in the non-religious sphere may achieve protections of some sort. </strong>B<strong>lessed are the cakemakers. </strong><strong>Stay tuned for that one.</strong><br></li> <li><strong>The government announced a national amnesty for illegal guns.<br></strong></li> <li><strong>The Coalition has referred a number of matters from the last election to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters (Jscem). They include political donations, funding political parties, electronic voting and foreign political donations. <br></strong></li> <li><strong>Eighteen years after her first first speech, Pauline Hanson used her second first speech to move her targets from Indigenous people and Asian people to Asian people and Muslim people. She wants a ban on all immigration, a ban on new mosques, Muslim migration if she can\u2019t get the full ban, burkas, Islamic schools, mosques. She wants to look after the old and sick Australians but without the growing tax base from migration. Like the government, Hanson wants to make kids out of schools wait for welfare and instead teach them to get a job. Even where there are no jobs. And so it went.<br></strong></li> <li><strong>Labor senator Malarndirri McCarthy followed her with a speech talking about her Indigenous and non-Indigenous heritage and her long path to the senate. She contrasted with Hanson to say she was in the senate for all people, Indigenous and non, from all around the world. Underline. She said she understood the trepidation over Indigenous recognition, the idea of asking for recognition again was difficult. She wants reforms for the Northern Territory, perhaps including moving to becoming the seventh state and increasing the representation numbers for the territory. At the end, Hanson congratulated her, lingered and gave her a hug. Cameras whirled.</strong></li> </ul> <p>Tomorrow, Shorten will still be hanging with his new bestie, <strong>Justin Trudeau</strong>. It will be the final day of the sitting week. Thanks to <strong>Paul Karp, Katharine Murphy, Gareth Hutchens, Katharine Murphy </strong>and<strong> Greg Jericho</strong>. <strong>Mike Bowers</strong>\u2019 pictures were outstanding. And thanks everyone for your input. We couldn\u2019t do it without you.</p> <p>Goodnight. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57d90b35e4b067ad300878d8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-14T08:41:35.874Z\">9.41am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The other quote I have pulled out of <strong>Pauline Hanson\u2019s</strong> speech relates to her call for a halt to further immigration. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At present our immigration intake is 190,000 year. High immigration is only beneficial to multinationals, banks and big business seeking a larger market while everyday Australians suffer from this massive intake. They are waiting longer for their lifesaving operation, the unemployment queues grow longer, and even longer when government jobs are given priority to migrants. Our city roads have become parking lots, schools are bursting at the seams. Our aged and sick are left behind to fend for themselves and many towns and cities struggle to provide water for an ever-growing population. Our service providers struggle to cope due to lack of government funding, leaving it to charities to pick up the pieces. Governments both state and federal have a duty of care to the Australian people. Clean up your own backyard before flooding our country with more people who are going to be a drain on our society. <strong>I call for a halt to further immigration and look after our aged, sick and helpless first.</strong></p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-14T08:43:34.724Z\">at 9.43am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57d90901e4b0e813b694cdae\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-14T08:23:47.454Z\">9.23am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"338a213f43f20c69ef90c60df9373e24f83cb2da\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/338a213f43f20c69ef90c60df9373e24f83cb2da/0_0_4500_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Western Australian senator Pat Dodson greets NT Labor senator Malarndirri McCarthy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Western Australian senator Pat Dodson greets NT Labor senator Malarndirri McCarthy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-14T08:25:05.111Z\">at 9.25am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57d90801e4b0e813b694cda9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-14T08:21:49.533Z\">9.21am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c3c9200a56c808bbdf06833ec2835da4e516d6c7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c3c9200a56c808bbdf06833ec2835da4e516d6c7/0_0_4500_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Queensland senator Pauline Hanson greets Northern Territory Labor senator Malarndirri McCarthy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Queensland senator Pauline Hanson greets Northern Territory Labor senator Malarndirri McCarthy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7a57b9e90707155bb42cf3b3f9ca1e5ada330407\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a57b9e90707155bb42cf3b3f9ca1e5ada330407/0_0_4500_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hanson hugs McCarthy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hanson hugs McCarthy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-14T08:25:53.496Z\">at 9.25am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57d90778e4b05caf65ecd098\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-14T08:17:24.302Z\">9.17am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"961a5bfacf32244f1e4d8a46a9185793ef279f39\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/961a5bfacf32244f1e4d8a46a9185793ef279f39/0_0_4500_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Senator Malarndirri McCarthy delivers her first speech\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Senator Malarndirri McCarthy delivers her first speech.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-14T08:26:08.852Z\">at 9.26am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57d90650e4b0e813b694cda5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-14T08:14:55.429Z\">9.14am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>OK, I have located that final quote from <strong>Pauline Hanson</strong>. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I can guarantee the name Pauline Hanson carries with it independence, honesty, assurance, quality and reliability.

In case you missed it, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/09/one-year-on-malcolm-turnbulls-brutal-reality-is-theres-no-time-like-the-present\"><strong>Katharine Murphy</strong> wrote about it last Friday</a> \u2013 which could be characterised as no time like the present. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Turnbull has been acting like a prime minister with time on his hands \u2013 time to recover from an election setback, time to plug in to the great geopolitical developments of our age, time to play a part, time to determine a new agenda for a new parliament, time to do some good on a range of fronts, time to fight on and live another day, another week, another month, another term.</p> <p>Perhaps he\u2019s acutely aware of the difficulties he\u2019s in, yet he\u2019s seemed slow to grasp the harsh political realities of his post-election position \u2013 landmines everywhere, contingency everywhere.</p> <p>Here is the brutal reality facing Malcolm Turnbull as he faces his first anniversary in the job he\u2019d always wanted.</p> <p>He doesn\u2019t have time.</p> <p>He has now, and he wastes now at his peril.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.afr.com/news/politics/national/malcolm-turnbull--a-year-in-charge-of-the-office-of-wicked-problems-20160912-grew85#ixzz4KBOHTf3L\">Laura Tingle of the Australian Financial Review</a> has written a piece today that takes a different tack. She started the piece with former Labor leader and US ambassador Kim Beazley, backing in Turnbull on the Kevin Rudd nomination for UN secretary general. Beazley\u2019s conversations with the prime minister confirm the view that Turnbull did not consider Rudd a suitable candidate. And that a government could not nominate someone without endorsing. She uses the example for a wider point.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Beazley\u2019s intervention forces us to think again about this incident, and opens a wider appraisal of Turnbull\u2019s prime ministership than has generally been seen in the orgy of words marking 12 months since he toppled Tony Abbott.</p> <p>Much has been made in the past year \u2013 and the past week \u2013 of the high expectations voters had that Turnbull would transform politics and their disappointment that he has not.</p> <p>The prime minister\u2019s performance is rated in terms of these expectations. Many of those who criticise him notably do so because he has not delivered what they particularly want.</p> <p>On the left, there is disappointment on issues like climate change and same-sex marriage. On the right, the criticism is he hasn\u2019t done enough on tax reform, budget repair and industrial relations.</p> <p>But there is very little said about the way the Turnbull prime ministership actually works. Whether it is good, bad or indifferent, it is certainly a very, very different prime ministership.</p> <p>Let\u2019s be blunt here. This is a bloke who is not particularly good at retail politics, nor particularly concerned about running to the beat of the retail politics drum.</p> <p>As one cabinet minister says, \u201cYou will observe that a particular issue isn\u2019t quite zooming down the ski slope politically and he thinks that\u2019s fine, he\u2019s relaxed. He doesn\u2019t mind things being a bit \u2018off piste\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Yet all those who have moaned about three-word slogans and politicians driven by the 24-hour media cycle and \u201cannounceables\u201d still don\u2019t seem happy with an approach so conspicuously lacking such frenzy.</p> <p>Few doubt Turnbull\u2019s intellectual capacities. But few also observe that the prime minister sees his job foremost as head of the \u201cOffice of Wicked Problems\u201d, not first as the beating heart of a political organisation focused on winning the next election.</p> </blockquote> <p>Discuss.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-13T23:57:25.318Z\">at 12.57am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57d88e46e4b067ad3008770e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-13T23:44:59.757Z\">12.44am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Bowen says, hey government, there is more we can do to fix the budget together.

          "bodyText": "That\u2019s enough for me. I need to go and stick my eyeballs in a glass of water and my spirit in a decompression chamber. Today: The budget omnibus bill - agreed on by the Coalition and Labor - passed through the lower house but not without protests from Greens MP Adam Bandt and Andrew Wilkie. Fellow crossbenchers Cathy McGowan and Bob Katter joined them to oppose the bill. There appeared to be some funny business going on around the $800m put back into the renewable energy agency Arena (which was going to lose $1.3bn). It remains a net loss. Malcolm Turnbull introduced the same sex marriage plebiscite bill. Bill Shorten let it be known that he would recommend blocking the bill. But we don\u2019t have it from his mouth because he jetted off to meet Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau. There is some suggestion via Paul Karp that a Coalition briefing note suggests conscientious objectors in the non-religious sphere may achieve protections of some sort. Blessed are the cakemakers. Stay tuned for that one. The government announced a national amnesty for illegal guns. The Coalition has referred a number of matters from the last election to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters (Jscem). They include political donations, funding political parties, electronic voting and foreign political donations. Eighteen years after her first first speech, Pauline Hanson used her second first speech to move her targets from Indigenous people and Asian people to Asian people and Muslim people. She wants a ban on all immigration, a ban on new mosques, Muslim migration if she can\u2019t get the full ban, burkas, Islamic schools, mosques. She wants to look after the old and sick Australians but without the growing tax base from migration. Like the government, Hanson wants to make kids out of schools wait for welfare and instead teach them to get a job. Even where there are no jobs. And so it went. Labor senator Malarndirri McCarthy followed her with a speech talking about her Indigenous and non-Indigenous heritage and her long path to the senate. She contrasted with Hanson to say she was in the senate for all people, Indigenous and non, from all around the world. Underline. She said she understood the trepidation over Indigenous recognition, the idea of asking for recognition again was difficult. She wants reforms for the Northern Territory, perhaps including moving to becoming the seventh state and increasing the representation numbers for the territory. At the end, Hanson congratulated her, lingered and gave her a hug. Cameras whirled. Tomorrow, Shorten will still be hanging with his new bestie, Justin Trudeau. It will be the final day of the sitting week. Thanks to Paul Karp, Katharine Murphy, Gareth Hutchens, Katharine Murphy and Greg Jericho. Mike Bowers\u2019 pictures were outstanding. And thanks everyone for your input. We couldn\u2019t do it without you. Goodnight. The other quote I have pulled out of Pauline Hanson\u2019s speech relates to her call for a halt to further immigration. At present our immigration intake is 190,000 year. High immigration is only beneficial to multinationals, banks and big business seeking a larger market while everyday Australians suffer from this massive intake. They are waiting longer for their lifesaving operation, the unemployment queues grow longer, and even longer when government jobs are given priority to migrants. Our city roads have become parking lots, schools are bursting at the seams. Our aged and sick are left behind to fend for themselves and many towns and cities struggle to provide water for an ever-growing population. Our service providers struggle to cope due to lack of government funding, leaving it to charities to pick up the pieces. Governments both state and federal have a duty of care to the Australian people. Clean up your own backyard before flooding our country with more people who are going to be a drain on our society. I call for a halt to further immigration and look after our aged, sick and helpless first. OK, I have located that final quote from Pauline Hanson. I can guarantee the name Pauline Hanson carries with it independence, honesty, assurance, quality and reliability. Something the Chinese can never buy. And halal snack packs never provide it. I\u2019m just trying to track down the text of the Hanson speech. McCarthy\u2019s friends and family yell from the gallery, \u201cLove you, Dirri.\u201d Please reconsider your plebiscite bill ... make marriage equality a reality. She reminds Malcolm Turnbull of the hateful debate that ended Adam Goodes\u2019 football career, in a challenge to the idea that hate speech will not feature in the plebiscite debate. To the sister girls and brother boys who struggle with their sexuality, I say to you stay strong. I stand with you. She says she understands Indigenous recognition is a bitter pill to swallow to ask again for recognition from other people. (But she does not urge a change to Labor policy supporting recognition on that.) Is it not time to consider a vision for the north? We need a vision that unites over 100 Indigenous language groups in the NT alone? She raises the possibility of the NT becoming a seventh state and urges the government to consider a way of getting more NT senators and members into the parliament. Let the people of the NT have a say. McCarthy says she has been questioned as to how she is so educated, given she is an Indigenous woman. McCarthy commends Indigenous journalists, of which she was one before entering politics. She talks about her ancestors, both Indigenous and non-Indigenous. Their support for the Wave Hill walkoff, which she says attracted support from many Australians, not just Indigenous. She thanks a range of people, including her fellow Indigenous colleagues Pat Dodson and Linda Burney. Hanson\u2019s mob has left but she stays to listen to McCarthy. McCarthy is talking about her path to the Senate. She says she is here to represent not just her people but for all people, Indigenous and non-Indigenous, migrants and all in the Northern Territory. Underline. Contrast. So there was no words on Indigenous people, the previous offenders. The Asian community remain a menace, as do of course Muslims. She has a corner on common sense and good old fashioned values, in her mind. The rest of us are just kidding ourselves. Stay tuned for Malarndirri McCarthy. Her mob are sitting in the opposite stalls. They give her applause as she opens with her Indigenous language. Hanson reckons she comes from a breed taught morals, values, common sense. And there are some final quotes which I will check before I print because I was a little gobsmacked. That\u2019s it, everyone comes up to congratulate her. Minus the Greens, of course. Hanson thanks her kids, her families and controversial staffer James Ashby. She notes Ashby has been kicked around by the establishment, as she has. Pauline Hanson says she will not do a Derryn Hinch and speak for 45 minutes. She says she has six years so she has plenty of time \u2013 which will make the Greens cringe. Oh no, they have left. Both parents\u2019 incomes should be taken into account. Make it fair with both custody and child support and most parents will take on their responsibility, she says. On to family law. Discriminatory and biased, she says. I referred to it in the last first speech, says Hanson. If anything it has got worse. Men suicide and women make frivolous claims. We will continue to see murders due to \u201csheer frustration\u201d, she says. Hanson supports the Coalition policy not wanting school leavers to go straight on to welfare. Teach them how to apply for a job, she says. (That might be news to some of the kids in her supporters\u2019 small towns.) She advocates no more welfare payments for mothers with a second child. Get a job and learn to look after it, she says. She says while foreign buyers can only buy new properties, it is not policed. Our land and assets are not for sale. Overpaid public servants. Tick. You never miss the water \u2019til the well runs dry. Hanson moves on to debt and deficit. Welfare has become a way of life for some and rorted and abused by others. She wants a register of all land (not just agricultural) to see who owns the land. Why are we allowing an oppressive communist government like China to own our land, she asks. This foreign takeover is destroying small towns across the nation, she says. These foreign properties become food bowls for their countries, she says. What major projects have we had? She says while not many dams have been built, Australia has just put money towards welfare for \u201cmostly migrants\u201d. She calls for a total halt to immigration and for the government to look after the aged and sick instead. (Which would be interesting without the tax base.) If we do not make changes now, have no doubt, we will have sharia law. Therefore, she says, she is in favour of stopping Muslim immigration, mosques, Islamic schools, burkas, halal certification costs. Australians have never got to vote on multiculturalism, she says. Hanson is going through statistics on Islam globally. Then snippets of news. Threats to Christmas celebrations, forced halal certification taxes, prayer rooms. She\u2019s going the whole gamut. Muslims want to see sharia law imposed in Australia. Why has Islam and its teachings had such an impact on Australia, she asks. It\u2019s \u201cpartly a religion\u201d but its more than that. It regulates their total life. She says the unemployment rate, the prison population, organised crime rates are higher in Muslim populations. Australians in general are more fearful. The Greens walk out en masse. Hanson says if you are not prepared to give Australia your undivided loyalty, you should: Go back to where you came from. She offers to drive you to the airport and \u201cwave you goodbye\u201d. As a strong and united team, I guarantee we will make a difference. Hanson says her first first speech woke Australia up. She names current problems, including aggressive multiculturalism and trade agreements. Too many Australians are afraid to work alone at night. They are afraid of terrorism. She says when she first warned Australia was being swamped by Asians, it wasn\u2019t out of disrespect. It was a warning that things were changing fast and political parties were appealing for votes. She says now the same is happening with Muslims. Hanson starts with a reminder that when she left the parliament last time, she told the chamber she would be back. Other members shouted: \u201cNo you won\u2019t.\u201d She says there have been many legal battles since then, including a stint in maximum security. She says she was Australia\u2019s first political prisoner. I\u2019m back. But I am not alone. Hanson is sitting next to David Leyonhjelm and in front of her fellow One Nation senators Malcolm Roberts and Brian Burston. Last time I covered her first speech, Labor and Coalition members boycotted. They have not done so today. Their benches are not full but not empty either. The galleries are starting to fill in the Senate with families and friends of Pauline Hanson and Malarndirri McCarthy. The special minister of state, Scott Ryan, has released the reference to the joint standing committee on electoral matters (Jscem). Referral by Special Minister of State Senator the Hon Scott Ryan to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matter That the following matters be referred to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters for inquiry and report: 1. All aspects of the 2016 Federal election and matters related thereto, and without limiting the scope of the committee\u2019s inquiry, with particular reference to: a. The application of provisions requiring authorisation of electoral material to all forms of communication to voters; b. The potential applicability of \u2018truth in advertising\u2019 provisions to communication to voters including third-party carriage services; c. The options available to Parliament to ensure consistent application of disclosure rules to and the regulation of all entities undertaking campaign activities; and, d. The potential application of new technology to voting, scrutiny and counting, with particular reference to its application to remote voting, ADF personnel on deployment and supporting vision-impaired voters. 2. The extent of donations and contributions from foreign sources, persons, entities and foreign-owned subsidiaries to political parties, associated entities and other third parties and entities undertaking campaign activities, and the options available to Parliament to regulate these. 3. The current donations, contributions, expenditure and disclosure regime, its application and timeliness and alternative approaches available to Parliament. 4. The extent to which fundraising and expenditure by third parties is conducted in concert with registered political parties and the applicability and utilisation of tax deductibility by entities involved in campaign activities. 5. Any matters related to the terms outlined above. In considering these matters, the Committee is encouraged to consider previous inquiries and reports of past committees, regulatory developments implemented by States and Territories and recent determinations of the High Court with respect to these. The Committee is requested to provide a report in respect of item 1a by December 1, 2016, and item 2 by March 3, 2017. (It looks like the Coalition is going to have a proper go at the issues at the start of this inquiry. Let\u2019s see where it goes.) FYI. This development is in regard to the ongoing stoush between Labor\u2019s Mark Dreyfus and George Brandis over access to the attorney general\u2019s diary. Brandis lost a case last week and so Dreyfus is trying to get information again. As we await first speeches, I urge you to read Katharine Murphy\u2019s piece on Pauline Hanson ahead of her speech. Understanding Hanson\u2019s context is simple enough. But we face another challenge. The problem is not so much comprehending Pauline. Her shtick is now reasonably familiar. The contemporary problem is how we engage constructively with Hansonism, and by constructively I actually mean deconstructively, which is our core business as journalists: calling out the snake oil, attempting to protect people from being manipulated. Paul Karp has an exclusive regarding the plebiscite: The government will propose new protections for \u201cconscientious objectors\u201d to same-sex marriage, which marriage equality advocates fear could allow civil celebrants, registrars and even bakers and florists to refuse to serve gay weddings. According to briefing notes on the plebiscite prepared for the Coalition party room, seen by Guardian Australia, the legislation would allow \u201cconscientious objectors\u201d to reject gay weddings, an exemption more extensive than merely allowing religious leaders to refuse to conduct them. The prospect of extensive exemptions to discrimination law would provide a further reason for Labor and others to block the plebiscite and and could split the yes vote in the plebiscite if it went ahead. 18 years in the making. Coming up. From earlier today, Natalie Kotsios of the Weekly Times reports National MP Andrew Broad has said foreign investment thresholds in free-trade agreements should be reconsidered and brought down to $15m. The government brought the Foreign Investment Review Board thresholds down to $15m for agricultural land and $55m for agribusiness. But exemptions built into free-trade deals with the US, New Zealand and Chile remain, for whom the threshold is $1.094bn. \u201cSome say you can\u2019t renegotiate a deal but I think that [the threshold] is an anomaly and if we\u2019re going to be true to ourselves, we need to be consistent with everyone,\u201d Mr Broad said. The Nationals\u2019 MP for Lyne, David Gillespie, is giving the reply, defending Turnbull and the Coalition. Meanwhile in the Senate, I hear whispers the government is seeking to extend the sitting hours of the Senate on Thursday afternoon after a couple of days of filibustering. Tanya Plibersek references the plebiscite. She says, in years gone by, other families were deemed not suitable. Have we not learned that we should give up judging other people\u2019s relationships? ... Families come in all different shapes and sizes. Plibersek says everyone is waiting for the real Malcolm Turnbull to stand up. This fizza is the real Malcolm Turnbull. Tanya Plibersek is prosecuting the matter of public importance today, namely \u201cthe prime minister\u2019s failure of leadership\u201d. The deputy leader mentions the artist in her electorate who produced this poster: There was a government question to Christopher Pyne as defence industry minister. Then Labor asked financial services minister O\u2019Dwyer again about superannuation, regarding whether she agreed to meet Labor. She reiterates she looks forward to sitting down with Labor to discuss the Coalition\u2019s super policy. Next government question to the infrastructure and transport minister, Darren Chester, on northern Australia investment. There is a government question to Sussan Ley: Will the minister outline to the House the government\u2019s commitment to fighting the scourge of cancer in our society, including funding for preventive measures? This is about Labor refusing to agree cuts to the public dental scheme. This was part of the original omnibus bill but Labor stopped it. Here is Ley: The deputy leader of the opposition probably doesn\u2019t take quite the same approach to budget repair as some of the economic hardheads in her party because she desperately hung on to a measure that makes absolutely no sense in the context of public health and she\u2019s highlighted it, thank you, the kids dental measure ... The problem is it\u2019s not a public dental scheme. It\u2019s a scheme where, if you have an income of $178,000 and two children, you could access this public dental scheme. A very interesting question from Andrew Leigh to Kelly O\u2019Dwyer: Why won\u2019t the government join with the opposition to produce a package of superannuation concession reforms that add $4.4bn to the budget bottom line over the medium term? O\u2019Dwyer: The Coalition government has put forward a very detailed policy as outlined in the budget, a very detailed policy is outlined in the budget. Those opposite don\u2019t believe in some of the flexibility measures that would actually deliver for individuals the ability to contribute more into their superannuation to provide more in their retirement. We on this side think it\u2019s important to protect those flexibility measures, which is why we have argued so strongly for them. (This is interesting because it is the next obvious policy area for Labor and the Coalition to cooperate on after the budget cuts. The political problem for Morrison would be ignoring the conservatives who oppose the super changes within the Coalition in order to strike a deal with Labor, which already has a similar policy. The Coalition need Labor \u2013 or someone \u2013 in the Senate anyway.) The agriculture minister, Barnaby Joyce, is asked a government question about water infrastructure, which gives him a chance to talk about dams. BJ loves dams. There is another question on superannuation, this time to the financial services minister, Kelly O\u2019Dwyer. It refers to a report in the Australian Financial Review that the superannuation draft bill is not out because it is \u201cdifficult to draft\u201d. O\u2019Dwyer does not mention when the bill is appearing but launches into a defence of the government\u2019s superannuation policy. The foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, answers a question on keeping Australians safe overseas. She has been meeting with European ministers to discuss border protection, law enforcement collaboration and intelligence sharing. The government is sending a representative to work in the cell which was set to counter the online threat, establishing a new security unit in government and setting up a joint initiative with the UK in Jakarta to strengthen regional terrorism and law enforcement agencies. On queue: Labor in the lower house asks Scott Morrison: Last night the member for Warringah said Joe Hockey was the last treasurer who was serious about a structural reform budget. Does the treasurer agree with the member for Warringah\u2019 s assessment of the job that, the more time passes the better Joe Hockey looks? Obviously Morrison is not going near that question and instead talks about the government\u2019s economic plans and Labor\u2019s plan to \u201carrest economic growth\u201d. In the wings, Katharine Murphy reports Tony Abbott looked up at the question and then looked down with no expression. When Morrison said \u201cachievements\u201d Abbott looked up again with the shadow of a smile. George Brandis just told the Senate: I believe Malcolm Turnbull will rank with Sir Robert Menzies and John Howard as one of Australia\u2019s great prime ministers. Josh Frydenberg gets a question on Arena, the subject of fierce debate this morning during the budget omnibus bill. (The government obviously thought they needed to explain.) Will the minister update the House on the benefits for renewable energy in the government\u2019s budget savings of an omnibus bill? The omnibus bill is good news for the renewable energy sector because we will restore $800m in grants for the renewable energy sector through Arena while keeping the $10bn Clean Energy Finance Corporation intact. Which doesn\u2019t really explain where the money is coming from. The landscape today. Chris Bowen to Scott Morrison: I refer to the treasurer\u2019s previous answer in which the treasurer said the government was committed to the revenue from its superannuation policy but failed to confirm the government is committed to the policy itself. We ask again \u2013 can the treasurer confirm the concessional cap for superannuation will continue to have a $500,000 limit and a 2017 start date? Morrison talks about how important the superannuation reforms are but does not commit to the specific measures. Of course the backstory here is that Morrison is still negotiating (as far as we know) with his backbenchers. Some of them oppose the measures. A government question to the social services minister, Christian Porter: Will the minister update the House on savings achieved in the social services portfolio over the past 12 months? Are there any alternative approaches? This is a chance for Porter to take the mickey out of Labor for supporting Coalition budget measures which they previously opposed. Apparently some of the posters against the cuts are still displayed in Labor offices in parliament. Wilkie to the health minister, Sussan Ley: I\u2019ve received many complaints from older Australians and their families about the ridiculous cost of home care packages. One example is a client who was effectively being charged $165 an hour for assistance with house cleaning and showering when all of the administrative expenses were included. The problem is that there\u2019s a cap on fees but no floor on services. And this allows overcharging by many service providers on a scale, a reasonable person would characterise as systemic rorting. Minister, this is obviously unacceptable, both for the consumers who can\u2019t afford the fees and for the taxpayers who are subsidising the packages. What will you do about it? Ley wants to hear about the individual case. It is true that at the moment providers of home care packages can charge an administration fee and we expect them to charge a reasonable fee. Ley says that, under reforms going to parliament, the care packages will be attached to the consumer rather than the aged care providers. This situation will not therefore happen. We will give the consumer the power of the spending on their own care, on their own package in their own home that allows them to live exactly the life that they choose, not dictated by providers, not with excessive administration fees, but actually recognising that choice in aged care is vital. A government question to Morrison on a strong economy. We need to break the curse of Labor\u2019s debt, says Morrison. Plibersek to Morrison: Given that it\u2019s more than four months since the budget, can the treasurer confirm that the nonconcessional superannuation cap will continue to have a $500,000 limit and a 2017 start date? Morrison: We continue to pursue those measures because those measures are essential to not just the equity of the system as it stands but the intergenerational equity as we have a growing and ageing population. Plibersek to Turnbull: A group of Catholic nuns and their supporters working to combat slavery and support victims of human trafficking is in Canberra today. They have been told that government cut also mean they will lose their funding from July next year. Why is that? Why is it that the PM can find over $170m to spend on an unnecessary damaging and divisive plebiscite but he can\u2019t find the money to help the victims of human trafficking? Turnbull: Yes, it will cost $170m. But what price democracy? ... There was a time when the Labor party did not accuse people who disagreed with them of being homophobes, the extraordinary hateful expressions used by PM innocent figures in the Labor party against people who do not support same-sex marriage is a disgrace. We respect each side and the Labor party should do the same. Many of their constituents sincerely, honourably, conscientiously believe that same-sex marriage should not be made the law of land. They\u2019re entitled to do that. We will give them a choice. Shorthand from Shalailah: Christopher Pyne and Anthony Albanese are baiting each other. The first government question is on long-term economic prosperity. Far from having the hard catastrophic economic landing that so many economists predicted, our economy is transitioning well. But it\u2019s not happening by accident. It needs clear leadership and that is what we\u2019ve provided. Now, the options available to the parliament today are as clear as they are stark. We have to make this 45th parliament work for all of us. Murpharoo reports: The prime minister just sauntered in to the chamber with Darren Chester. Sitting down in his chair, he looked over the dispatch box to TPlibs. He must have smiled a welcome. She grinned back. Sitting behind TPlibs, Mark Butler and Kate Ellis both tapped their knees and shot her a thumbs up. The first question from Plibersek to Turnbull: The Haymarket clinic in Darlinghurst has provided free medical nursing and welfare services to homeless and vulnerable people for more than 40 years. But has been forced to close its doors because of the PM\u2019s cuts. Why is it that the PM can find over $170m to spend on an unnecessary and damaging and divisive plebiscite but he didn\u2019t find $900,000 to keep the Haymarket clinic open? Turnbull says the government is providing funding to health but doesn\u2019t really go to the specifics. Remember Bill Shorten is not in the parliament today or tomorrow due to a trip to Canada. Tanya Plibersek as deputy will lead Labor for question time. Derryn Hinch spoke about the archaic Senate rules earlier today. The Senate will not allow photos of anyone other than those with the call \u2013 which are different to the rules in the lower house. Hinch is trying to get something done but because we could not make the press conference, I will have to catch up. More after question time. We have question time coming up shortly. Take your places. Nationals MP Andrew Gee is giving his first speech. I missed the first bit \u2013 due to seeking sustenance \u2013 but I did hear that he supports fixed four-year terms. Hear hear. This morning, the Coalition have pushed Labor to support the plebiscite bill to no avail. We understand that Bill Shorten will recommend Labor block the plebiscite bill. Malcolm Turnbull has just presented the bill to parliament. He argued he supports marriage equality \u201cbecause he is a conservative\u201d but it is a matter of conscience and therefore people of goodwill had the the right to oppose it. Very few Labor MPs went to hear his speech and Shorten was flying to Canada to meet Justin Trudeau. The treasurer introduced the amendments to the budget omnibus bill and the Labor amendments. The Greens MP Adam Bandt and the Denison independent Andrew Wilkie spoke vociferously against the cuts, which would still see a $500m cut from Arena from its initial funding of $1.3bn, instead of the previously announced full cut to Arena. The MPs also questioned where the money would come from for the Coalition Labor deal \u2013 given the financial minister\u2019s suggestion that it would come from the Clean Energy Innovation Fund. They did not get any answers. The government has announced a national amnesty ahead of increasing penalties for holding illegal guns. Pauline Hanson still thinks we may be swamped by the Chinese and there might be a recession. She will further outline her views in her first parliamentary speech (this time around) at five \u2013 followed shortly after by the Labor Indigenous senator Malarndirri McCarthy. Happy anniversary Malcolm. This was during the Bandt-Wilkie incursion on the budget bill. The PM was waiting for the budget bill to pass but the argy bargy meant it went on longer than expected. Eventually he left and came back later. Slowly, government MPs entered the chamber as he began speaking on the marriage bill. The chamber filled. Finally, a late arrival. Labor was largely a no-show for the marriage bill. Meanwhile, backstage ... (Un) holy alliance. The crossbench and their friends. Mr Omnibus. Now its time to catch up with some wonderful photos from Bowers from the omnibus bill and the plebiscite speech. After that, a summary. After that, hopefully, lunchette. So that is it and the bill is left for another day. Malcolm Turnbull has questioned the opposition of Julia Gillard to same-sex marriage and her comments at that time. He asks why Labor did not denounce her as homophobic. Turnbull outlines the details which were released yesterday, relating to the public funding, the question and the yes and no committees. He finishes on the mandate point. We took this to the election and we won the election. There was no doubt about our policy. There was no doubt about our platform. This was prominently debated every day of the election campaign, every Australian who took any interest in the election knew that was our policy. We have a mandate for it and the opposition should respect it. I ask the leader of the opposition today to support this plebiscite. This plebiscite will give the Australian people the say on this. I ask Labor to respect the people they represent. Turnbull says the arguments against the plebiscite have fallen into two categories. It\u2019s not the normal way we change laws. It will cost too much. He says those two arguments are valid but the government has decided on the plebiscite so they have \u201cdecided to proceed\u201d. But he says the argument that the debate will be not be civil \u201cinsults the Australian people\u201d. BTW, Bill Shorten is not in the house because he has flown to Canada to meet Justin Trudeau. Turnbull: But there are many other Australians who are equally filled with love, equally respectful of gay couples, equally respectful of the families, of gay couples, of same-sex couples, who will, in thoroughly good conscience, vote no. And they will do so not because they disrespect gay couples, not because they disrespect the couple that was in the house yesterday with their little boy, they will do so because of a deeply felt conscience. It is a matter of conscience and we should respect it. Turnbull: We have to respect there are sincerely held views on this issue. They are views very often informed by deeply felt conscience, informed by religious commitment very often, informed by faith. It is we have to respect and we must respect \u2013 and I can say the government respects, the diversity of views on this issue ... From the bottom of my heart that our society was stronger if more people were married and there were fewer divorces. If there was something we could do to make families happier, it would be a wonderful thing. We know that the breakdown of the family unit is one of the great causes of hardship, of poverty, of so many of our social ills ... And sticking together and working hard and supporting their children and their families and enabling their dreams. And that is why I support same-sex marriage. David Cameron summed it up very well some years ago when he said, \u201cI support same-sex marriage, not despite being a conservative, but because I am a conservative, because we value commitment.\u201d So that is where I stand, that is where Lucy stands. Malcolm Turnbull harks back to the change in attitudes on the issue. He remembers speaking to George W. Bush in 2007 about the issue of superannuation changes relating to same-sex couples. I remember discussing this point with President Bush many years ago, at the time of Apec in 2007, when we were discussing what were the big moral issues in Australian politics, and we talked about this issue of equal access to superannuation, and I remember the president said: \u201cWell, those are all issues of finance. The big moral issue is the one about marriage.\u201d And we have to respect that it is a very big moral issue. Turnbull on the plebiscite bill: I present to the House today the commitment that we made in the election campaign to put the question of whether same-sex couples will be allowed to marry under Australian law to the Australian people in a plebiscite. Now, we believe that that commitment is one that all members of this parliament should support and respect. It is thoroughly democratic. It is thoroughly democratic. Every Australian will have their say and, if the opposition support the plebiscite in the Senate, the plebiscite can be held on 11th February, which is the soonest practicable date. The budget bill has passed. We are onto the same-sex marriage plebiscite. Malcolm Turnbull is on his feet. Christopher Pyne has moved to shut down the debate, given Bandt and Wilkie have had a fair go. Andrew Wilkie has asked that his and Bandt\u2019s dissent be recorded. The Greens MP Adam Bandt says if we can find this tricky deal in 20 minutes of debate, what else will we find in the budget omnibus bill agreed to by the Coalition and Labor? I for one am not prepared to wave it through? The clue to your job is in the title - TO OPPOSE! It looks as though the plebiscite bill is not going to get to the plebiscite before question time. Answering the crossbench queries, Chris Bowen says we have an agreement to work together to ensure the deal for $800m for Arena. Bandt says the fact that neither Bowen nor Morrison answer the question properly suggested they had been caught out. He says the $800m to \u201csave\u201d Arena was taken out of another government \u201cclean energy bucket\u201d, according to the bill\u2019s explanatory memorandum. So to be clear, Cormann said yesterday the $800m to \u201csave Arena\u201d would be taken from the Clean Energy Innovation Fund. Labor then denied that was part of the deal this morning. Again, from the Guardian story: A spokesman for Mark Butler, Labor\u2019s climate and energy spokesman, told Guardian Australia he was confused and surprised by Cormann\u2019s comments. \u201cOur understanding and expectation is that he is not cutting CEFC,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government\u2019s clean energy innovation fund was never the subject of negotiations. \u201cThe discussion was progressed on the basis that any save that fell short of what we needed would be made up for by some other area, and that\u2019s exactly what happened. So no cut to the Clean Energy Innovation Fund is needed. So both Bandt and Wilkie are questioning this, given it is contained in the explanatory memo for the bill. The clerk of the house is rushing around with a new memo. The revised memo takes out the reference. To which, Wilkie says, where is it coming from then? Bandt: They are robbing Peter to pay Paul ... this is what happens when you do dirty deals. OK, Bandt\u2019s amendment was voted down. Now the house is moving onto the amendments agreed between Labor and the Coalition. Adam Bandt is asking the treasurer about the Clean Energy Innovation Fund, quoting Mikey Slezak\u2019s story this morning. The finance minister, Mathias Cormann, has said the Coalition\u2019s deal with Labor to save some funding for the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (Arena) will be balanced by a new cut to the Clean Energy Innovation Fund \u2013 but Labor has denied that was the agreement. Speaking on Sky News, Cormann said: \u201cLabor has asked for us to restore $800m of that for grants funding so we will do that but the capital available to the Clean Energy Innovation Fund will be reduced accordingly.\u201d It is understood that would in effect be cutting the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) by $800m, because the innovation fund is part of the CEFC. He also stated that the proposed $1.3bn in cuts to Arena were actually going to be diverted from Arena to the innovation fund, suggesting that the new deal is reversing that move. Bandt wants to know where the money is coming from to save Arena. General confusion ensues. Adam Bandt, Bob Katter, Andrew Wilkie and Cathy McGowan voted against the first of many procedural questions on the budget omnibus bill. The fifth crossbencher, NXT MP Rebekha Sharkie, is the only crossbencher not there. The House is dividing still on the Greens\u2019 amendment to the budget omnibus bill. There have been some questions in the thread about why the government is filibustering in government business. In the parliamentary program, there are certain times set down for certain business, such as government biz or private member\u2019s biz or indeed question time. At the beginning of a parliament, obviously while the lower house is debating things, the Senate has got little to do because they are waiting for bills to pass. Things like the budget bills were being nutted out, the plebiscite bill had to be sorted in cabinet and party room and other bills were not simply not ready to go. Labor\u2019s clear grasp on procedural matters also allowed a slowing of the process. Therefore, if the government business session has no business, they have to talk about something else or they move on to Other People\u2019s Agendas. Which is not good for a government. If you want to know more, the parliament has live minutes in both the Senate and the lower house, which gives you an idea of the timing of sessions like government business and other matters. Keep refreshing so you are up to date. The Turnbull government has made two gun-related announcements this morning. It says it will be introducing legislation to parliament this week to crack down on illegal guns. The legislation will increase the maximum penalties for gun smuggling to up to 20 years and make mandatory minimum sentencing of five years for those who are convicted of gun smuggling. The government also plans to start a national gun amnesty so people can hand in their illegal guns without penalty. It will not be a buyback. The justice minister, Michael Keenan, said his state and territory colleagues have agreed in principle to the plan but the details will have to be worked out. He said his National party colleagues were onboard. \u201cEverybody is on board with this because there\u2019s no one in the Coalition wants to see more illegal guns on the streets,\u201d he said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about targeting people who legally own firearms. This is about targeting the grey market, the black market for guns, and getting guns that are not registered or held properly off our streets.\u201d Fairfax Media reported on Wednesday that the crackdown comes after an unprecedented wave of violent firearm-related crime in Melbourne. Sorry, jumped the gun. The first vote was on the consideration of the bill. There will be a number of amendments coming. The first is a Greens amendment to take out the cuts to Arena, which is $500m off its $1.3m funding package, leaving it with $800m. Wind back the tax breaks to the mining companies or the banks, says the Greens MP Adam Bandt. Not happy Bill. The lower house is now voting on the budget omnibus bill. I just want to clarify the Labor position on the plebiscite. While Bill Shorten is understood to be recommending blocking the plebiscite, it has yet to be ticked off by both the shadow cabinet and the caucus \u2013 both required processes in Labor policy formulation. #justsaying The treasurer is back in the house to close off on the omnibus bill. In the meantime, have a read of Paul Karp\u2019s story about finance department advice warning government it may not make its planned surplus in 2020. The finance department has warned the re-elected Turnbull government that a number of \u201csignificant downside risks\u201d may prevent its planned slim surplus in 2020. The risks include blocked \u201czombie\u201d budget savings measures and cost blowouts in the national disability insurance scheme. This is the guts of the advice: The brief noted the government planned to achieve a 0.2% budget surplus by 2020-21 and to shrink payments as a proportion of GDP from 25.8% to 25.2% in that time. The \u201csignificant downside risks\u201d which might ruin the planned surplus included: The risk of a \u201csignificant negative economic shock\u201d Failure to pass $18bn of savings booked in the pre-election economic and fiscal outlook but still unlegislated because they are blocked in the Senate Growth in the number and package costs of clients of the NDIS Potential increased costs for defence operations, new drugs on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and disaster relief It\u2019s a really good speech from Andrew Wilkie in its breadth. He has covered refugees and climate change as well as budget measures. He says its important to look after the community and as climate change is the biggest threat to Australia, he does not shy away from talking about it. The term \u201cquisling\u201d is repeated regularly \u2013 and he ends on it, in regard to Labor. You are a pack of quislings. In the house, Adam Bandt and Andrew Wilkie are tearing strips off Labor for doing the budget deal with the Coalition. Wilkie describes the budget omnibus bill as a black-hearted bill ... it is not a fair-minded bill ... it betrays Labor voters. He asks: Why not go after high-income earners ... people like us. By way of contrast, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Income Tax Relief) is coming into the house later this afternoon. This is the \u201cbracket creep\u201d bill that: Amends the Income Tax Rates Act 1986 to increase the third personal income tax threshold so that the rate of tax payable on taxable incomes from $80 001 to $87 000 for individuals is 32.5%. It effectively gives people earning more than $80,000 a $315 tax cut. Bill Shorten is expected to recommend to the caucus that Labor blocks the Coalition\u2019s plebiscite legislation. Shorten and Labor have been equivocating on what they will do with the legislation even though they oppose a plebiscite and believe there should be a free vote in parliament. Last night Labor said Shorten would be consulting with groups and people effected by the plebiscite debate. This expected recommendation this morning to block the bill is a move forward. Possibly to leave his own caucus is in no doubt as to what his position is. Labor will still do the consultations but from a known leadership position of blocking the plebiscite bill. There are twists with double pikes going on here. Bear with me. Senate is debating tobacco excise hike which was a Labor initiative taken up by the government. There are a lot of government speakers on this. Methinks there is a little buying of time for the government in the red chamber. First speech juxtaposition: Pauline Hanson\u2019s first speech at 5:00, immediately followed by Labor Indigenous senator Malarndirri McCarthy. Every prime minister needs a spine. The Labor MP Ed Husic is showing his usual cheek by bringing a spine for Malcolm Turnbull. He thought, given recent decisions, Turnbull might need it. There have been many words written on Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s one-year anniversary. In case you missed it, Katharine Murphy wrote about it last Friday \u2013 which could be characterised as no time like the present. Turnbull has been acting like a prime minister with time on his hands \u2013 time to recover from an election setback, time to plug in to the great geopolitical developments of our age, time to play a part, time to determine a new agenda for a new parliament, time to do some good on a range of fronts, time to fight on and live another day, another week, another month, another term. Perhaps he\u2019s acutely aware of the difficulties he\u2019s in, yet he\u2019s seemed slow to grasp the harsh political realities of his post-election position \u2013 landmines everywhere, contingency everywhere. Here is the brutal reality facing Malcolm Turnbull as he faces his first anniversary in the job he\u2019d always wanted. He doesn\u2019t have time. He has now, and he wastes now at his peril. Laura Tingle of the Australian Financial Review has written a piece today that takes a different tack. She started the piece with former Labor leader and US ambassador Kim Beazley, backing in Turnbull on the Kevin Rudd nomination for UN secretary general. Beazley\u2019s conversations with the prime minister confirm the view that Turnbull did not consider Rudd a suitable candidate. And that a government could not nominate someone without endorsing. She uses the example for a wider point. Beazley\u2019s intervention forces us to think again about this incident, and opens a wider appraisal of Turnbull\u2019s prime ministership than has generally been seen in the orgy of words marking 12 months since he toppled Tony Abbott. Much has been made in the past year \u2013 and the past week \u2013 of the high expectations voters had that Turnbull would transform politics and their disappointment that he has not. The prime minister\u2019s performance is rated in terms of these expectations. Many of those who criticise him notably do so because he has not delivered what they particularly want. On the left, there is disappointment on issues like climate change and same-sex marriage. On the right, the criticism is he hasn\u2019t done enough on tax reform, budget repair and industrial relations. But there is very little said about the way the Turnbull prime ministership actually works. Whether it is good, bad or indifferent, it is certainly a very, very different prime ministership. Let\u2019s be blunt here. This is a bloke who is not particularly good at retail politics, nor particularly concerned about running to the beat of the retail politics drum. As one cabinet minister says, \u201cYou will observe that a particular issue isn\u2019t quite zooming down the ski slope politically and he thinks that\u2019s fine, he\u2019s relaxed. He doesn\u2019t mind things being a bit \u2018off piste\u2019.\u201d Yet all those who have moaned about three-word slogans and politicians driven by the 24-hour media cycle and \u201cannounceables\u201d still don\u2019t seem happy with an approach so conspicuously lacking such frenzy. Few doubt Turnbull\u2019s intellectual capacities. But few also observe that the prime minister sees his job foremost as head of the \u201cOffice of Wicked Problems\u201d, not first as the beating heart of a political organisation focused on winning the next election. Discuss. Bowen says, hey government, there is more we can do to fix the budget together. He names private health insurance and VET fees. He also thanks the treasurer, Scott Morrison. In the lower house, we begin. Chris Bowen is speaking on the budget bill. This is the resumption of a debate, which had already begun. After the compromise deal yesterday, amendments will be moved to accommodate the deal and then the vote will happen. Bowen is reinforcing the point that they wanted budget cuts that are fair. He says the \u201cbaby bonus\u201d was unaffordable and he congratulated the government for dropping it. He notes Labor\u2019s opposition to the baby bonus was compared to China\u2019s one child policy by government members. As a bookend for the Hanson post, you must check out Gareth Hutchens\u2019 piece on her One Nation colleague Malcolm Roberts. The One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts has used his first speech to pour scorn on modern climate science, call for Australia to leave the United Nations and question the reliability of data from Australian government departments and agencies. He railed against the level of taxation in Australia and thanked his colleagues in the Galileo Movement, such as Ian Plimer, the radio host Alan Jones and the late professor Bob Carter for their constant questioning of climate science. He said he loved to ask questions to get to the truth, like Socrates. Parliament calling space. The second first Pauline Hanson speech is on tonight. This morning, she was doorstopped in the press gallery. If we keep heading down the path of selling our land and our houses and everything, we will be swamped by the Chinese. They talk about there is a smaller amount than other interests, foreign, even owned, but if Kidman station was sold they would be second to Britain. Q: What do you make of Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s performance given this is the first anniversary of him becoming PM? I think a lot of people have been disappointed with him. They have expected more of him and his performance. He is treading very, what can I say, on thin water at the moment because he hasn\u2019t got the numbers in the lower house. So the last election I think has been a big wake-up to the Liberal party and the National party. So people will want to see something happening. If they don\u2019t start reining in the budget, I believe we will be heading down the path of a recession. And yes, the Senate has guvvie business. Excise tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016 Customs Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016 And, if these bills make it up to the red chamber, these will be debated too: Competition and Consumer Amendment (Country of Origin) Bill 2016 Treasury Laws Amendment (Income Tax Relief) Bill 2016 Budget Savings (Omnibus) Bill 2016 These are the bills on the program for the lower house today: Budget Savings (Omnibus) Plebiscite (Same-Sex Marriage) Australian Crime Commission Amendment (Criminology Research) Narcotic Drugs Legislation Amendment Narcotic Drugs (Licence Charges) Social Services Legislation Amendment (Simplifying Student Payments) Tax and Superannuation Laws Amendment (2016 Measures No. 2) The shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, has also spoken to Radio National about a $6.3bn savings deal agreed between the government and opposition on Tuesday. Asked about the remaining $12bn of the government\u2019s \u201czombie\u201d savings blocked in the Senate, Bowen said there was no room for compromise. We\u2019ve been very clear and consistent about those. He said the 2014 budget measures were \u201cunfair\u201d, including making unemployed people wait for the dole or making people work until 70 to get the pension. Speaking about the marriage equality plebiscite, Bowen said legislation could change the Marriage Act but a referendum is needed to recognise Indigenous Australians in the constitution. While we are having this debate about a plebiscite and making the people do what parliament should, we\u2019re not progressing Indigenous recognition. There\u2019s not enough bandwidth in the political debate to allow us to have a referendum on Indigenous recognition and plebiscite on marriage equality at the same time. Katharine Murphy wrote a piece last night about a reference to joint standing committee on electoral matters (JSCEM). Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s answer to donation reform post-Dastyari was that the JSCEM would look at all of these issues and then make recommendations (which are often ignored). Here is Murph\u2019s piece: The government is poised to send a reference to the joint standing committee on electoral matters requiring a fresh look at Australia\u2019s donations and disclosure system after negotiations with key Senate crossbenchers and the ALP. The special minister of state, Scott Ryan, has signalled he will ask the committee to examine the question of foreign donations, fundraising, and activity by third parties, reporting by March. While negotiations were still underway on Tuesday night with Labor and other key stakeholders, the new inquiry is expected to be confirmed by the Turnbull government on Wednesday. The likelihood of imminent agreement has prompted the Nick Xenophon Team to withdraw a motion it wanted to push through the Senate calling for an inquiry foreign political donations; sources of private (including corporate and union donations) and public funding and contribution limits and caps; alternative funding practices including consideration of comparative overseas models operating in Canada and the UK; transparency, accountability and reporting measures, and potential limits on election expenses. No doubt JSCEM may get a submission from the Americans, if the ambassador\u2019s comments are any indication. The Coalition-Labor compromise on the $6.3bn budget bill was a welcome relief \u2013 a sign that politicians can get in a room and find some common ground. If you wondered why Tony Abbott\u2019s prime ministership was such a dogfight, it may have been because he does not appear to believe in compromise. Free Ruddesque advice from Peta Credlin. The environment and energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, has been on Radio National explaining the government\u2019s compromise with Labor to retain $800m in the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. The decision decreases the planned cut from $1.3bn to $500m over four years. This is good news for the job of budget repair ... this is also good news for the renewable sector, because $800m of grants has been restored to Arena. The reality is we have to work with Labor, the Greens and the crossbench to pass savings because 89% of government spending is tied to legislation. The Arena deal is part of a wider plan to save $6.3bn by dropping the cut to the clean energy supplement to new welfare recipients but also dropping a $1.4bn \u201cbaby bonus\u201d. Frydenberg says the deal is a credit to the treasurer, Scott Morrison, and the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, but only grudgingly gave credit to Labor, noting the total of $6.5bn of budget savings in the omnibus bill were measures the opposition had supported before the election. Asked about the first year of Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s prime ministership, Frydenberg rated it as \u201coutstanding\u201d. He rattles off statistics including GDP growth of 3.3% and unemployment of 5.7%. In the poll published yesterday he [Turnbull] was way ahead of Bill Shorten in terms of preferred prime minister ... don\u2019t subscribe to the Bill Shorten victory lap, he actually lost the election. I noted attorney general George Brandis\u2019 plea to Bill Shorten and Labor. Shorten has said it will be three weeks before they will give an answer, which is inexplicable to me. They say they are consulting with the LGBTI community, which would make sense if there had not been extensive and intense consultations in this building and across the country. If Labor opposes the plebiscite, surely they should just put everyone out of their misery and block it. Here is Brandis: I would appeal to Mr Shorten and members of the Labor caucus to realise that if they support this plebiscite bill, then there will be a plebiscite on the 11th of February, which all of the opinion poll evidence indicates would be passed overwhelmingly. And if those of us, and I\u2019m one, who believe that we ought to reform our marriage law and there ought to be marriage equality, we can have marriage equality within a matter of months. This is so close now you can touch it. Instead, I\u2019m sorry to say, so far Mr Shorten has been putting political game playing ahead of the merits of the issue. Mr Shorten only a year ago said he did support a plebiscite, he thought it was a good day of dealing with the issue. The fact is that Mr Shorten wants gay people to wait for years and years so that he can play politics and, if that\u2019s the way this lands, then that will be disgraceful. Labor\u2019s shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, has been around the traps this morning. He was asked how he would rate Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s first year. F. F for Fail. The Australian\u2019s Paul Kelly has an intervention by the outgoing US ambassador John Berry on the issue of donations by Chinese companies following the fall of Sam Dastyari. The US has expressed its alarm about the influence of China and the Beijing government in Australia\u2019s domestic politics and wants reforms to eliminate China\u2019s ability to use financial donations to influence Australian politicians. In an exclusive interview, the departing US ambassador to Australia, John Berry, said foreign donations were illegal in America and the US had been \u201csurprised\u201d by Chinese money power in this country and wanted Australia to resolve the issue. \u201cIt is an entirely different matter when the government of China is able to directly funnel funds to political candidates to advance their national interests in your national campaign,\u201d Mr Berry told the Australian. \u201cThat, to us, is of concern. We cannot conceive of a case where a foreign donation from any government, friend or foe, would be considered legitimate in terms of that democracy.\u201d Good morning, A year ago today, Malcolm Turnbull toppled Tony Abbott. The Coalition government became the second government to change a prime minister in the first term. This was his pitch: It is clear enough that the government is not successful in providing the economic leadership that we need. It is not the fault of individual ministers. Ultimately, the prime minister has not been capable of providing the economic leadership our nation needs.\u201d Our political editor, Katharine Murphy, looks back at the past year, charting the peaks and troughs of the Turnbull prime ministership. It is well worth your time. Tony Abbott has been speaking about his demise, suggesting he doesn\u2019t want to go over the entrails. He has to accept the world as it is, rather than as it was or even \u201cas it should be\u201d. With that year in mind, the prime minister comes to parliament today to present two key bills. The first is the budget omnibus savings bill, which is the compromise on budget cuts outlined by the Coalition and Labor yesterday. It is worth $6.3bn. The second is the plebiscite (same-sex marriage) bill, as it is known. The attorney general, George Brandis, has been on ABC already this morning, appealing to Bill Shorten and the Labor caucus to support the bill. Brandis is a supporter of marriage equality and did not support the plebiscite originally. But the moderates in the party have decided this is the only way thy will be done. Brandis tells the ABC there will be plebiscite on February 11 and marriage equality could be a reality \u201cin a matter of months\u201d. Let\u2019s crack on because there is a bit to catch up with.

          "bodyText": "When Queen Victoria picked Ottawa to be the capital of Canada it was an unimposing frontier town: the city has since grown into a modern metropolis packed with award-winning restaurants, stunning architecture and a local population that\u2019s all about the outdoors. For fitness freaks Whatever the weather, Ottawites embrace all four seasons. On lazy, hazy summer Sundays, stretches of the Sir John A Macdonald Parkway are closed to traffic and become a pedestrian haven. Why not join the dog walkers and bicyclists, in-line skaters and joggers alongside the beaches and rapids of the Ottawa river? You can paddle the rivers that frame the city \u2013 the Ottawa, Gatineau or Rideau \u2013 or enjoy the wildlife in urban parks or the much-loved Greenbelt, around 20,000 hectares (around 49,500 acres) of farms, forests and wetlands that surrounds the capital. In May, admire the rich colours of the Canadian Tulip Festival; it\u2019s the world\u2019s largest, with over a million orange, red and yellow flowers. In winter, locals descend en masse to skate on Ottawa\u2019s central Rideau canal. The world\u2019s largest naturally frozen ice-skating route is home to a hardy crowd who chow down on Beavertails (that\u2019s a pastry, not an animal\u2019s tail), pull on cosy clothes and toques (wool hats), and glide along for nearly 5 miles (around 7.8 km). For three weekends in February, the Winterlude festival brings ice sculptures, foodie events and a children\u2019s Snowflake Kingdom. For architecture enthusiasts Thanks to it\u2019s historical significance, Ottawa is not short of imposing buildings. Admire the vaulting neo-gothic spires of Parliament Hill, the crystal tower of the National Gallery of Canada and, just across the river in the twin city of Gatineau, the Canadian Museum of History, the design of which is inspired by Canada\u2019s topography. The Hill is also the centre point for Canada Day, Canada\u2019s birthday celebrations every 1 July. Expect to find a stage showcasing Canadian musicians, followed by fireworks at night. Watch from the Hill or behind the Fairmont Ch\u00e2teau Laurier, the historic \u201ccastle\u201d, opened as a grand hotel in 1912. Parliament\u2019s central Peace Tower is perfect for a bird\u2019s-eye panorama of the city; visit on Wednesdays at noon in summer for free yoga sessions in front of parliament on the lawn. Keep your eyes peeled: you might just see prime minister Justin Trudeau and his wife Sophie Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau joining in. For foodies There\u2019s a vibrant restaurant scene in Ottowa. Explore the eclectic cuisine of Canadian Culinary Champion Marc Lepine, the only chef to win the Gold Medal Plates competition twice, at his restaurant Atelier; or the innovative Middle Eastern fare of Walid El-Tawel at Fairouz. City neighbourhoods are equally exciting and eminently walkable. ByWard Market is arguably the most vibrant, with more than 120 places to eat and drink in a four-block-by-four-block patch that\u2019s also home to a great selection of shops. Also try Westboro and the Glebe, where you\u2019ll find Lansdowne, a complex with a year-round farmers\u2019 market and a new stadium where you can catch sports events downtown. For history buffs Ottawa\u2019s museum and gallery scene reflects Canadians\u2019 past and future hopes. Gatineau\u2019s Canadian Museum of History\u2019s Grand Hall with its towering totem poles captures the lasting presence of indigenous cultures, while the museum\u2019s new Canadian History Hall presents the largest and most comprehensive exhibition about Canadian history ever created. In contrast, quirky Bytown Museum reveals the history of Ottawa . Here you can discover the military raison d\u2019\u00eatre of the Rideau canal \u2013 a Unesco world heritage site \u2013 as you learn about its construction after the British colony\u2019s war of 1812 with the US.

          "body": "<p>Theresa May will tell the leaders of the world\u2019s most powerful economies that the United Kingdom wants to strengthen its economic ties with countries beyond the European Union, as she lays out her vision of a post-Brexit Britain at her first big international summit as prime minister.</p> <p>Attending the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/03/theresa-may-nuclear-row-xi-jinping-china-uk-relations-g20-summit\"> G20 meeting in Hangzhou, China, </a>May will address the opening session saying that, as the UK heads out of the EU, it remains \u201copen for business\u201d and is seeking to build new and stronger trade relations with countries across the globe.</p> <p>But diplomats past and present warned that she faces a huge test as a novice on the world stage, and will have to perform a delicate balancing act as she seeks to sell the UK to global leaders, while avoiding giving the impression that Britain is about to become a marginal player on the European stage.</p> <p>In a sign of her determination to show that the UK is embarking on a new phase in its diplomatic and economic relations, May will hold four bilateral meetings with the leaders of the US, China, Russia and India, but none with EU leaders.</p> <p>British officials have denied that she is cold-shouldering the Europeans, and stressed that since becoming prime minister she has already met the leaders of France and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jul/20/germany-uk-brexit-theresa-may-angela-merkel-politics-live\">Germany</a> to address the challenges of Brexit. The G20, they said, is her chance to convince other world leaders that the UK is a \u201cdependable\u201d partner which will \u201ccontinue to play a bold confident and outward-looking role as it leaves the EU\u201d.</p> <p>Speaking on BBC1\u2019s <em>The Andrew Marr Show</em> on Sunday morning, recorded before she left for the G20, May said the economic figures were not as bad as some had predicted after the EU referendum vote. \u201cWhat is important for us now is that we maintain that policy of ensuring economic stability and a strong economy for the future. Part of that is going to be, as we come out of the European Union, ensuring we\u2019ve got trade deals around the world. I want the United Kingdom to be a global leader in free trade.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the things I\u2019ll be doing at the G20 is emphasising the role that we will be playing in the world, but also in a number of the discussions I\u2019ll be having, with President Obama, for example, prime minister Modi, prime minister Turnbull \u2026 \u201d</p> <p>A bilateral meeting with President Xi Jinping of China, after the official summit proceedings close on Monday, will arguably be May\u2019s sternest test. Her decision, shortly after entering Downing Street, to delay a go-ahead for the Hinkley Point C nuclear plant in Somerset, on which China has committed to spend billions of pounds, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/sep/03/hinkley-point-c-theresa-may-china-g20-summit\">has severely strained relations with Bejing</a>.</p> <p>The former UK foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind told the <em>Observer</em> that the G20\u2019s Chinese hosts would be \u201csurprised and puzzled\u201d by the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU, but would probably be more attentive to May as a result. \u201cAlthough they will think that we are slightly barking for wanting to leave the EU, they will in some way see us as more interesting and needing more of their attention. We will be the second biggest economy in Europe, a permanent member of the UN security council, and a strong military power with the willingness to use that power.\u201d</p> <p>However, Rifkind said the Hinkley Point issue would hover over the summit. \u201cWhatever the wider and longer-term issues, Hinkley is the immediate test. The Chinese president and UK prime minister will be sizing each other up. Hinkley Point is directly relevant to China\u2019s global economic ambitions.</p> <p>\u201cIf we drop Hinkley Point, and even if we stress that this is for economic reasons alone, the Chinese will see it as a major defeat for their ambitions. We will be seen as joining with the US and Australia in rejecting China as a partner, and that will not be helpful for relations. This may be the right decision for the UK to take, but there will be a price to pay.\u201d</p> <p>May told Marr: \u201cI\u2019m looking at the Hinkley decision, but it\u2019s about how I actually approach these things. I look at the evidence, I take the advice, I listen to that. That\u2019s what I\u2019m still doing. I\u2019ve said there\u2019ll be a decision in September.\u201d</p> <p>Lord Wood of Anfield, a former senior adviser to Gordon Brown, said May would be thrown in at the deep end of international diplomacy at a crucial moment in the UK\u2019s history. There was a risk of being seen as a bit player in Europe.</p> <p>\u201cTheresa May has a tricky combination of challenges this week. In the wake of Brexit, she has to show that Britain\u2019s relationship with Germany, France and Italy is not suffering,\u201d Wood said. \u201cShe has to show that European \u2018caucusing\u2019 prior to and during the G20 is still alive and well. Any hint of Franco-German-Italian cosiness that excludes her risks suggesting we are on the way to becoming a second-tier G20 country. She will also need to consider the appropriate mixture of robustness and conciliation to adopt in her dealings with Vladimir Putin.\u201d</p> <p>On her meeting with Barack Obama, Wood added: \u201cShe will have to show that Britain still matters to an outgoing president who has been increasingly speaking his mind, and whose <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/22/barack-obama-brexit-uk-back-of-queue-for-trade-talks\">advice on Brexit</a> was conspicuously rejected by the British electorate.\u201d</p> <p>Before boarding her plane for China, May insisted that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/16/theresa-may-writes-letter-reassurance-chinese-president-xi-jinping-hinkley-point-c\">UK-China relations have a bright future</a>. \u201cThis is a golden era for UK-China relations, and one of the things I\u2019ll be doing at the G20 is obviously talking to President Xi about how we can develop the strategic partnership that we have between the UK and China. But I\u2019ll also be talking to other world leaders about how we can develop free trade around the globe and how Britain wants to seize those opportunities.\u201d</p> <p>Global security and the fight against terrorism will also be high on the prime minister\u2019s agenda.</p> <p>Margaret Thatcher\u2019s former foreign policy adviser Lord Powell of Bayswater said he expected May to approach the G20 in a much more cautious manner than his former boss, who would have piled in with her demands and views. May would be more concerned with \u201csignals\u201d than substance.</p> <p>\u201cIn one day to be seeing Obama, Putin, and Xi Jinping is quite a scorecard. She will want to show that she believes the UK can make a success of Brexit. It will be a case of signals more than getting down to any definitive business.\u201d</p> <h2>ENEMIES ABROAD?<br></h2> <h2>Xi Jinping <br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"914c701ce10bfd98482ae5af3f70e280adbcda82\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/914c701ce10bfd98482ae5af3f70e280adbcda82/807_1143_995_597/500.jpg\" alt=\"Xi Jinping.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Xi Jinping.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>China\u2019s president said on a state visit to London last year that he hoped Britain would be a \u201cgateway to Europe\u201d for his country. George Osborne, the then chancellor, talked of the UK being China\u2019s \u201cbest partner in the west\u201d and of a golden era of British-Chinese relations. Now, with Britain heading out of the EU and doubts over whether Theresa May will go ahead with the Hinkley Point C nuclear power project, into which China has agreed to pump billions of pounds, relations are tense. China has already made clear that it would regard abandonment of the project as a snub. After the summit, May will have a bilateral meeting with Xi at which she will make clear that the decision will be for the British government alone. Xi will view the eventual decision by the prime minister later this month as a test of how dependable the UK is and of its wider willingness to be a partner in China\u2019s developing global economic ambitions.</p> <h2>Vladimir Putin <br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"576f71e84656cb7e8f0a16a615e1359044999b81\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/576f71e84656cb7e8f0a16a615e1359044999b81/0_79_3216_1930/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vladimir Putin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vladimir Putin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>May will have a bilateral meeting with Putin on Sunday at which difficult security issues, including Russia\u2019s role in Syria and actions in Ukraine will be raised. The Russian president is almost certainly the only G20 leader who will have welcomed and seen overall benefits for his country from Britain\u2019s intended departure from the EU. Russia sees it as a sign that the bloc on his doorstep is no longer such a cohesive force and threat to his interests. Putin will also see potential for closer economic ties with the UK and may be looking for indications that the EU\u2019s resolve behind sanctions against Russia will now weaken. But May will not want to risk angering the US or her EU counterparts, with whom she must negotiate Brexit, by cuddling up too much to Moscow.</p> <h2>Fran\u00e7ois Hollande<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"7293fdbb35d02a48b85cb44ee5b10f991049b971\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7293fdbb35d02a48b85cb44ee5b10f991049b971/0_113_4096_2457/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Francois Hollande.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fran\u00e7ois Hollande.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With Hollande facing presidential elections next year, he is sending a tough message to the British prime minister about future relations with Europe. France is adamant that the UK cannot expect special favours from the European Union - in terms of an exit deal - that undermines the founding principles of the EU. Hollande fears that this would merely encourage backing for anti-EU campaigner Marine Le Pen and the Front National, who will say that the French would also be better off out of the EU. France\u2019s Socialist president\u2019s message will be that there is a stiff price to pay for Brexit. Concerns over immigration and the future role of UK border guards in Calais may also be discussed.</p> <h2>RELATIONSHIPS TO WORK ON<br></h2> <h2>Angela Merkel<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"74c1a4ae0a67673acda9194db8df6d5718bcec67\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74c1a4ae0a67673acda9194db8df6d5718bcec67/419_436_1243_746/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Angela Merkel.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Angela Merkel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Theresa May has already been to Berlin for a meeting with Merkel since becoming prime minister and relations between Europe\u2019s two most powerful women were reasonably warm. No bilateral has been planned for the G20, however, signalling the UK\u2019s wider ambitions post-Brexit. As the EU\u2019s power broker, the German chancellor, who like Hollande is facing elections next year, has a balance to strike between remaining close to the UK while preserving the EU intact. Germany fears that the UK will try to bolster its economy post-Brexit by trying to lure in foreign investment through low corporate and other taxes. Berlin wants to make clear that if this is the route it chooses then its access to the EU single market, particularly for the sale of financial services, which represent more than 10% of the UK economy, will not be possible.</p> <h2>King Salman<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"1f70c56948aa91e11a1947a5e6e4af87e22da61e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f70c56948aa91e11a1947a5e6e4af87e22da61e/1080_279_545_327/500.jpg\" alt=\"King Salman.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">King Salman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Saudi Arabia has spent \u00a33bn on arms from the UK since the start of 2015, with critics voicing concerns that weapons may have been used against civilian targets in Yemen.

          "bodyText": "Theresa May will tell the leaders of the world\u2019s most powerful economies that the United Kingdom wants to strengthen its economic ties with countries beyond the European Union, as she lays out her vision of a post-Brexit Britain at her first big international summit as prime minister. Attending the G20 meeting in Hangzhou, China, May will address the opening session saying that, as the UK heads out of the EU, it remains \u201copen for business\u201d and is seeking to build new and stronger trade relations with countries across the globe. But diplomats past and present warned that she faces a huge test as a novice on the world stage, and will have to perform a delicate balancing act as she seeks to sell the UK to global leaders, while avoiding giving the impression that Britain is about to become a marginal player on the European stage. In a sign of her determination to show that the UK is embarking on a new phase in its diplomatic and economic relations, May will hold four bilateral meetings with the leaders of the US, China, Russia and India, but none with EU leaders. British officials have denied that she is cold-shouldering the Europeans, and stressed that since becoming prime minister she has already met the leaders of France and Germany to address the challenges of Brexit. The G20, they said, is her chance to convince other world leaders that the UK is a \u201cdependable\u201d partner which will \u201ccontinue to play a bold confident and outward-looking role as it leaves the EU\u201d. Speaking on BBC1\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show on Sunday morning, recorded before she left for the G20, May said the economic figures were not as bad as some had predicted after the EU referendum vote. \u201cWhat is important for us now is that we maintain that policy of ensuring economic stability and a strong economy for the future. Part of that is going to be, as we come out of the European Union, ensuring we\u2019ve got trade deals around the world. I want the United Kingdom to be a global leader in free trade. \u201cOne of the things I\u2019ll be doing at the G20 is emphasising the role that we will be playing in the world, but also in a number of the discussions I\u2019ll be having, with President Obama, for example, prime minister Modi, prime minister Turnbull \u2026 \u201d A bilateral meeting with President Xi Jinping of China, after the official summit proceedings close on Monday, will arguably be May\u2019s sternest test. Her decision, shortly after entering Downing Street, to delay a go-ahead for the Hinkley Point C nuclear plant in Somerset, on which China has committed to spend billions of pounds, has severely strained relations with Bejing. The former UK foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind told the Observer that the G20\u2019s Chinese hosts would be \u201csurprised and puzzled\u201d by the UK\u2019s vote to leave the EU, but would probably be more attentive to May as a result. \u201cAlthough they will think that we are slightly barking for wanting to leave the EU, they will in some way see us as more interesting and needing more of their attention. We will be the second biggest economy in Europe, a permanent member of the UN security council, and a strong military power with the willingness to use that power.\u201d However, Rifkind said the Hinkley Point issue would hover over the summit. \u201cWhatever the wider and longer-term issues, Hinkley is the immediate test. The Chinese president and UK prime minister will be sizing each other up. Hinkley Point is directly relevant to China\u2019s global economic ambitions. \u201cIf we drop Hinkley Point, and even if we stress that this is for economic reasons alone, the Chinese will see it as a major defeat for their ambitions. We will be seen as joining with the US and Australia in rejecting China as a partner, and that will not be helpful for relations. This may be the right decision for the UK to take, but there will be a price to pay.\u201d May told Marr: \u201cI\u2019m looking at the Hinkley decision, but it\u2019s about how I actually approach these things. I look at the evidence, I take the advice, I listen to that. That\u2019s what I\u2019m still doing. I\u2019ve said there\u2019ll be a decision in September.\u201d Lord Wood of Anfield, a former senior adviser to Gordon Brown, said May would be thrown in at the deep end of international diplomacy at a crucial moment in the UK\u2019s history. There was a risk of being seen as a bit player in Europe. \u201cTheresa May has a tricky combination of challenges this week. In the wake of Brexit, she has to show that Britain\u2019s relationship with Germany, France and Italy is not suffering,\u201d Wood said. \u201cShe has to show that European \u2018caucusing\u2019 prior to and during the G20 is still alive and well. Any hint of Franco-German-Italian cosiness that excludes her risks suggesting we are on the way to becoming a second-tier G20 country. She will also need to consider the appropriate mixture of robustness and conciliation to adopt in her dealings with Vladimir Putin.\u201d On her meeting with Barack Obama, Wood added: \u201cShe will have to show that Britain still matters to an outgoing president who has been increasingly speaking his mind, and whose advice on Brexit was conspicuously rejected by the British electorate.\u201d Before boarding her plane for China, May insisted that UK-China relations have a bright future. \u201cThis is a golden era for UK-China relations, and one of the things I\u2019ll be doing at the G20 is obviously talking to President Xi about how we can develop the strategic partnership that we have between the UK and China. But I\u2019ll also be talking to other world leaders about how we can develop free trade around the globe and how Britain wants to seize those opportunities.\u201d Global security and the fight against terrorism will also be high on the prime minister\u2019s agenda. Margaret Thatcher\u2019s former foreign policy adviser Lord Powell of Bayswater said he expected May to approach the G20 in a much more cautious manner than his former boss, who would have piled in with her demands and views. May would be more concerned with \u201csignals\u201d than substance. \u201cIn one day to be seeing Obama, Putin, and Xi Jinping is quite a scorecard. She will want to show that she believes the UK can make a success of Brexit. It will be a case of signals more than getting down to any definitive business.\u201d ENEMIES ABROAD? Xi Jinping China\u2019s president said on a state visit to London last year that he hoped Britain would be a \u201cgateway to Europe\u201d for his country. George Osborne, the then chancellor, talked of the UK being China\u2019s \u201cbest partner in the west\u201d and of a golden era of British-Chinese relations. Now, with Britain heading out of the EU and doubts over whether Theresa May will go ahead with the Hinkley Point C nuclear power project, into which China has agreed to pump billions of pounds, relations are tense. China has already made clear that it would regard abandonment of the project as a snub. After the summit, May will have a bilateral meeting with Xi at which she will make clear that the decision will be for the British government alone. Xi will view the eventual decision by the prime minister later this month as a test of how dependable the UK is and of its wider willingness to be a partner in China\u2019s developing global economic ambitions. Vladimir Putin May will have a bilateral meeting with Putin on Sunday at which difficult security issues, including Russia\u2019s role in Syria and actions in Ukraine will be raised. The Russian president is almost certainly the only G20 leader who will have welcomed and seen overall benefits for his country from Britain\u2019s intended departure from the EU. Russia sees it as a sign that the bloc on his doorstep is no longer such a cohesive force and threat to his interests. Putin will also see potential for closer economic ties with the UK and may be looking for indications that the EU\u2019s resolve behind sanctions against Russia will now weaken. But May will not want to risk angering the US or her EU counterparts, with whom she must negotiate Brexit, by cuddling up too much to Moscow. Fran\u00e7ois Hollande With Hollande facing presidential elections next year, he is sending a tough message to the British prime minister about future relations with Europe. France is adamant that the UK cannot expect special favours from the European Union - in terms of an exit deal - that undermines the founding principles of the EU. Hollande fears that this would merely encourage backing for anti-EU campaigner Marine Le Pen and the Front National, who will say that the French would also be better off out of the EU. France\u2019s Socialist president\u2019s message will be that there is a stiff price to pay for Brexit. Concerns over immigration and the future role of UK border guards in Calais may also be discussed. RELATIONSHIPS TO WORK ON Angela Merkel Theresa May has already been to Berlin for a meeting with Merkel since becoming prime minister and relations between Europe\u2019s two most powerful women were reasonably warm. No bilateral has been planned for the G20, however, signalling the UK\u2019s wider ambitions post-Brexit. As the EU\u2019s power broker, the German chancellor, who like Hollande is facing elections next year, has a balance to strike between remaining close to the UK while preserving the EU intact. Germany fears that the UK will try to bolster its economy post-Brexit by trying to lure in foreign investment through low corporate and other taxes. Berlin wants to make clear that if this is the route it chooses then its access to the EU single market, particularly for the sale of financial services, which represent more than 10% of the UK economy, will not be possible. King Salman Saudi Arabia has spent \u00a33bn on arms from the UK since the start of 2015, with critics voicing concerns that weapons may have been used against civilian targets in Yemen. The UK government would take a dim view if that were the case, but as it heads into a uncertain future outside the EU, May will not want to turn her back on what the UK government has identified as one of its priority markets abroad. Narendra Modi Theresa May has a bilateral meeting arranged with the Indian prime minister on Sunday, another sign that the UK is looking increasingly outside Europe for economic ties and trade deals as it heads for Brexit. India is an obvious choice for trade talks, with its huge developing markets. Modi will have his own concerns, however, about UK plans to tighten border controls and curb immigration, and will want reassurance that there will be continued access for skilled workers and students from his country into the UK. SPECIAL FRIENDS Barack Obama May has a bilateral meeting with Obama early on Sunday.

Canada\u2019s prime minister leaves on Tuesday for an eight-day official visit to China, ending at the G20 summit in Hangzhou, an industrial and economic powerhouse on China\u2019s south-eastern coast. Trudeau\u2019s Liberal party is billing this first official visit as an opportunity to build a closer long-term relationship with China compared with what party members call the \u201cad hoc\u201d relations of the past.

The subject of human rights remains sensitve: Wang provoked outrage in Canada after lashing out at a journalist for asking about the country\u2019s human rights record. Wang berated the journalist\u2019s question as \u201cfull of prejudice against China and arrogance\u201d and as \u201ctotally unacceptable\u201d, to the visible discomfort of global affairs minister of Stephane Dion, who stood next to him.

They arrived during the Howard era and 77% reported some form of discrimination. Focus group participants reported unwitting discrimination from children shocked at their skin colour, employment discrimination and general \u201cdistancing\u201d by people on the street as well as police harassment.

And my sister is like, she didn\u2019t even know what to say, she was shocked and they couldn\u2019t take that guy on, they had to send him back.</p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>Recent arrivals feel a sense of belonging</strong></h2> <p>We are a multicultural nation, where nearly half of us are born overseas or have a parent born overseas. We welcome 190,000 people a year under the immigration program, with 68% in the skilled stream, 32% in the family stream. Add on top another 13,750 humanitarian places.</p> <p>Markus found the strength of identification with Australia remains at a high level among immigrants; 64% of recent arrivals (who came between 2001\u201015) indicated a sense of belonging to a \u201cgreat\u201d or \u201cmoderate extent\u201d, compared to 63% of respondents two years earlier.</p> <p>They are optimistic, with only 6% of recent arrivals disagreeing with the statement that \u201cAustralia is a land of economic opportunity where in the long run, hard work brings a better life\u201d. (Though that does widen to 18% for those who arrived further back \u2013 between 1991 and 1995.)</p> <p>As you would expect, business (457) visa holders and independent skills reported better economic times, though the latter reported difficulty getting work. Online applications were difficult and for some, anglicising their name helped. One respondent said Australia was similar to a third world country where employment was based not on what you know but who you know.<br></p> <p>Harder though is economic freedom for humanitarian entrants. Of respondents, 36% were employed, while 20% were looking for work with a relatively high proportion reporting they were \u201cjust getting by\u201d or \u201cpoor\u201d. Yet they remained positive about life in Australia with 81% satisfied with their life.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e4d92f50ef6b043fcb440f1c5596ed23f232e1ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e4d92f50ef6b043fcb440f1c5596ed23f232e1ed/0_54_4463_2677/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A mother and a young girl attend a pro-refugee rally outside the Immigration Office in Brisbane in February 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A mother and a young girl attend a pro-refugee rally outside the Immigration Office in Brisbane in February 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Peled/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Discrimination the eye opener</strong></h2> <p>Every time Markus goes into the field, his team is refining the data, watching the trends, thinking about new movements. This time, he was keen to tap into the African immigrant experience. In their last 2013 recent arrival survey, they got only 25 respondents born in sub-Saharan countries other than South Africa.<br></p> <p>With effort, Scanlon received 166 South Sudanese respondents out of nearly 500 from Sub-Saharan countries. South Sudanese arrivals peaked in Australia from 1996 to 2005 in the Howard years under the humanitarian visa program. Of the respondents, 76% were satisfied with their life and 58% said life was more positive than they had expected.<br></p> <p>Balanced against that outlook was high unemployment rates among respondents (23%), low levels of personal trust (4%) compared with the average for recent arrivals (37%) and low levels of trust in police (26%).</p> <p>But it was experience of discrimination which was the real eye opener for Markus. In the previous 12 months, experience of reported discrimination was at 60% for Ethiopians, 67% for Kenyans, 75% for Zimbabweans and 77% for South Sudanese.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I didn\u2019t think we would get 77% experience of discrimination.</p> <footer> <cite>Andrew Markus, Monash University professor</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Markus says the numbers show the issues may be worse than he first thought. Almost as shocking is the realisation that the numbers may be underestimated.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think we would get 77% experience of discrimination and it\u2019s the way people talk about it that is surprising,\u201d he said.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2016-08-23T05:34:39/embed.html\" data-alt=\"discrimination selected african countries\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2016-08-23T05:34:39/embed.html\">discrimination selected african countries</a> </figure>  <p>Is this the most recent migrant group again reflecting back? The same survey found 59% of Indigenous Australians reporting experiences of discrimination.<br></p> <p>Markus, who has long been watching these trends, says the levels of culturally intolerant people in Australia are probably more like 20% of the population, instead of the 10% he was inclined to think.</p> <h2><strong>Technology brings homeland closer</strong></h2> <p>In the postwar years, migrant communities were almost completely cut off from their home towns and villages. Letters had to suffice and perhaps a phone call twice a year with the family gathered around. The communication revolution has changed that. Of arrivals between 2011 and 2015, 71% keep in contact with family or friends by SMS or social media daily or several times a week. Close to one in three arrivals between 2001 and 2015 watch televisions shows from their former home country at least several times a week. <br></p> <p>Markus says while there is still more data required, such a change could have a fundamental impact on the immigrant experience in Australia.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c8117e017ab4a07de36830a67bf337b1ac872431\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c8117e017ab4a07de36830a67bf337b1ac872431/321_0_2679_1608/1000.jpg\" alt=\"view of skype logo and microphone\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Many recent arrivals keep in touch with relatives or friends every week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cInexpensive technology means people in villages in India can buy a really cheap phone with cheap rates,\u201d Markus says.<br></p> <p>\u201cThat could fundamentally change Australia. The next generation choose their boundaries and choose their contacts so the centre is weakened because you can be just as well connected to an interest group across the world.\u201d<br></p> <p>Asked if it could change nation states, Markus says: \u201cIt brings it into question, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Pockets of diversity</strong></h2> <p>Markus found a prominent theme in focus group discussion related to the cleaving of diverse multicultural areas and monocultural areas \u2013 with participants talking about the visual difference on the street.</p> <p>There are comments such as these:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019ve got a lot of friends who come from the affluent side of Melbourne and they come from old Australian money and to them, I am like this foreign being because I\u2019m half Asian, I\u2019m half European but born here. When I\u2019m in Broadmeadows I\u2019m just normal.</p> </blockquote> <p>Or this:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Coming from my white workplace ... like extremely white ... walking from the station to Bankstown library ... I saw Asians and I saw a woman in hijab and I saw someone that was an Islander and I just thought \u2018friggin hell, why is this not reflected in my workplace ... Like this is actually Australia, that\u2019s not Australia, that\u2019s white Australia\u2019.</p> </blockquote> <p>So diversity continues but is contained. And Scanlon national surveys in the past four years show 56% either support the current intake or feel that it should be increased.<br></p> <p>But this year, 40% of Australian-born respondents considered the intake too high and that grew to 44% for Australian-born with both parents Australian born, known as third generation Australians.<br></p> <p>At the same time, when asked what they least liked about Australia, the first choice of 18% of third generation respondents was racism and discrimination. Another 19% of third generation Australians said too much immigration. There is Australia\u2019s race debate. They really need to get together. <br></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Men (35%) were more likely to reject cultural diversity than women (17%)</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Once Markus and his team started breaking it down according to the ethnic and cultural tolerance scale (where a low score rejects cultural diversity), 26% Australian-born respondents and 29% of third generation Australians had low scores. This split showed men (35%) were more likely to reject diversity than women (17%). Once the scores were split on address, city respondents (18% rejection of diversity) had lower rates than inner regional (25%) and outer regional (39%).<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2016-08-23T05:28:56/embed.html\" data-alt=\"ethnic and diversity tolerance\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2016-08-23T05:28:56/embed.html\">ethnic and diversity tolerance</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cThis highlights polarisation, what it shows is Pauline Hanson is not a surprise.

Examples from respondents include women being told to cover up by Muslim Australians.<br></p> <h2><strong>It\u2019s not like we\u2019re doing nothing ...</strong></h2> <p>For someone who has been studying the issues for so long, Markus is highly aware of the complexity \u2013 refusing to drop into stereotypes on migration, culture, race and religion. <br></p> <p>Asked how Australia compares globally, or with a comparable country such as Canada, Markus shrugs. \u201cAh [Canadian prime minister Justin] Trudeau. Different leadership \u2013 and the way he speaks is important\u201d.<br></p> <p>\u201cAustralians tend to react to spectacular injustice,\u201d he says. \u201cWe react to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jul/26/abu-ghraib-images-children-detention-australia-public-inquiry\">Don Dale [juvenile detention centre</a>] but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/10/the-nauru-files-2000-leaked-reports-reveal-scale-of-abuse-of-children-in-australian-offshore-detention\">what about the asylum seekers?</a> What is going to happen to them? We have a capacity to put it aside.<br></p> <p>\u201cStill, it\u2019s not like Australia is doing nothing. It\u2019s actually managing a large resettlement program, given its population and on top of that it has the 12,000 Syrians to take in.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not an inconsiderable contribution in terms of cost to government, given we are taking in people in the first generation who are going to have big difficulties, and maybe second generation as well.\u201d<br></p> <p>If there is a difficulty with the Scanlon report Australia Today, it is the sheer volume of information which portrays the complexity of Australia\u2019s culture. Conclusions are difficult to draw \u2013 the glass could be half full or half empty. But the exercise continues to be worthwhile.</p>",

There is also an intense frustration about the media\u2019s portrayal of Islam for similar reasons. Indeed for Muslim respondents, their treatment by the media as an amorphous mass was a big issue.

Balanced against that outlook was high unemployment rates among respondents (23%), low levels of personal trust (4%) compared with the average for recent arrivals (37%) and low levels of trust in police (26%). But it was experience of discrimination which was the real eye opener for Markus. In the previous 12 months, experience of reported discrimination was at 60% for Ethiopians, 67% for Kenyans, 75% for Zimbabweans and 77% for South Sudanese. Markus says the numbers show the issues may be worse than he first thought. Almost as shocking is the realisation that the numbers may be underestimated. \u201cI didn\u2019t think we would get 77% experience of discrimination and it\u2019s the way people talk about it that is surprising,\u201d he said. Is this the most recent migrant group again reflecting back? The same survey found 59% of Indigenous Australians reporting experiences of discrimination. Markus, who has long been watching these trends, says the levels of culturally intolerant people in Australia are probably more like 20% of the population, instead of the 10% he was inclined to think. Technology brings homeland closer In the postwar years, migrant communities were almost completely cut off from their home towns and villages. Letters had to suffice and perhaps a phone call twice a year with the family gathered around. The communication revolution has changed that. Of arrivals between 2011 and 2015, 71% keep in contact with family or friends by SMS or social media daily or several times a week. Close to one in three arrivals between 2001 and 2015 watch televisions shows from their former home country at least several times a week. Markus says while there is still more data required, such a change could have a fundamental impact on the immigrant experience in Australia. \u201cInexpensive technology means people in villages in India can buy a really cheap phone with cheap rates,\u201d Markus says. \u201cThat could fundamentally change Australia. The next generation choose their boundaries and choose their contacts so the centre is weakened because you can be just as well connected to an interest group across the world.\u201d Asked if it could change nation states, Markus says: \u201cIt brings it into question, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Pockets of diversity Markus found a prominent theme in focus group discussion related to the cleaving of diverse multicultural areas and monocultural areas \u2013 with participants talking about the visual difference on the street. There are comments such as these: I\u2019ve got a lot of friends who come from the affluent side of Melbourne and they come from old Australian money and to them, I am like this foreign being because I\u2019m half Asian, I\u2019m half European but born here. When I\u2019m in Broadmeadows I\u2019m just normal. Or this: Coming from my white workplace ... like extremely white ... walking from the station to Bankstown library ... I saw Asians and I saw a woman in hijab and I saw someone that was an Islander and I just thought \u2018friggin hell, why is this not reflected in my workplace ... Like this is actually Australia, that\u2019s not Australia, that\u2019s white Australia\u2019. So diversity continues but is contained. And Scanlon national surveys in the past four years show 56% either support the current intake or feel that it should be increased. But this year, 40% of Australian-born respondents considered the intake too high and that grew to 44% for Australian-born with both parents Australian born, known as third generation Australians. At the same time, when asked what they least liked about Australia, the first choice of 18% of third generation respondents was racism and discrimination. Another 19% of third generation Australians said too much immigration. There is Australia\u2019s race debate. They really need to get together. Once Markus and his team started breaking it down according to the ethnic and cultural tolerance scale (where a low score rejects cultural diversity), 26% Australian-born respondents and 29% of third generation Australians had low scores. This split showed men (35%) were more likely to reject diversity than women (17%). Once the scores were split on address, city respondents (18% rejection of diversity) had lower rates than inner regional (25%) and outer regional (39%). \u201cThis highlights polarisation, what it shows is Pauline Hanson is not a surprise. That demographic is clearly identifiable,\u201d Markus says. But he also warns warns against jumping to conclusions \u2013 saying he also found intolerance in overseas-born Australians towards Australian-born people. Examples from respondents include women being told to cover up by Muslim Australians. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re doing nothing ... For someone who has been studying the issues for so long, Markus is highly aware of the complexity \u2013 refusing to drop into stereotypes on migration, culture, race and religion. Asked how Australia compares globally, or with a comparable country such as Canada, Markus shrugs. \u201cAh [Canadian prime minister Justin] Trudeau. Different leadership \u2013 and the way he speaks is important\u201d. \u201cAustralians tend to react to spectacular injustice,\u201d he says. \u201cWe react to Don Dale [juvenile detention centre] but what about the asylum seekers? What is going to happen to them? We have a capacity to put it aside. \u201cStill, it\u2019s not like Australia is doing nothing. It\u2019s actually managing a large resettlement program, given its population and on top of that it has the 12,000 Syrians to take in. \u201cIt\u2019s not an inconsiderable contribution in terms of cost to government, given we are taking in people in the first generation who are going to have big difficulties, and maybe second generation as well.\u201d If there is a difficulty with the Scanlon report Australia Today, it is the sheer volume of information which portrays the complexity of Australia\u2019s culture. Conclusions are difficult to draw \u2013 the glass could be half full or half empty. But the exercise continues to be worthwhile.",

          "bodyText": "After years of delay, thousands of indigenous Canadians who were forcibly removed from their homes as children are finally getting their day in court. An Ontario superior court judge will on Tuesday hear arguments in a summary judgment motion for a class-action lawsuit brought against the Canadian federal government by survivors of the episode, known as the \u201cSixties Scoop\u201d. Around 16,000 indigenous children were taken from their families and communities, and put up for fostering or adoption by mostly non-indigenous families across Canada and the United States \u2013 often without the consent of their parents. Some were sent as far away as New Zealand and Australia. Survivors and their families say the forced removal robbed the children of their cultural identity and caused an emotional rift that has been felt through generations. The lawsuit was launched in February 2009 by two survivors, including Marcia Brown Martel, the class action\u2019s representative plaintiff, who was just four when she was removed from her family home on the remote Beaverhouse First Nation near Kirkland Lake, Ontario. She spent time in foster care before being adopted into non-indigenous family. Tuesday\u2019s hearing comes after seven years of delays that were mostly due to appeals by the federal government, which has fought the class-action since it was launched. It is estimated some 16,000 on-reserve children were removed from their homes by Ontario\u2019s child welfare services between 1965, when the federal government signed an agreement with the province to extend its welfare programs to reserves and 1984, when the provincial government incorporated protections regarding cultural identity into law.

In Liverpool, Greater Manchester and the West Midlands, each one is a man. In the shortlists there was only one woman, Luciana Berger MP. I am not surprised she didn\u2019t win, but I am incredibly disappointed that no woman did. What happened to the party that has for years beaten all other parties on representation of women and achieved so much for women?</p> <p>Justin Trudeau in Canada managed to get a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/05/canada-diverse-cabinet-includes-astronaut-badass-colonel\">50/50 cabinet</a>, but not just by giving out any old job to elected women. Years before he became prime minister, he tried to identify good women to run, in order to ensure there were plenty in the pipeline. Research shows that women often underestimate their potential to take on powerful roles, and need a nudge to do so. Trudeau recognised this and set up the <a href=\"https://www.liberal.ca/open-nominations/invite-her-to-run/\">Invite her to run</a> campaign. He identified brilliant women from all sorts of backgrounds and asked them to run. He didn\u2019t just sit back wearing a T-shirt with a feminist slogan, being a bit right on. He did something. Deeds not words.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/11/jeremy-corbyn-accused-of-backing-brothers-in-arms-over-women\">Jeremy Corbyn accused of backing 'brothers in arms' over women</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are many who will not like what I\u2019m saying. They will cry out that the best person for the job is what matters. If you sign up for that meritocracy argument, you must also then accept that the fact that women so rarely rise to the top means that we are just not as good as men. Same with black and ethnic minorities, disabled people and all the other people who are not identikit leaders.</p> <p>Others will try to tell me that representation of women in high office is feminism for the middle classes. I kindly point you to the words of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/leymah-gbowee\">Leymah Gbowee</a> who won the Nobel peace prize for her work with women in Liberia. When asked what single thing we could do to improve things for the poorest, most abused women of the world, she answered: \u201cMore women in power.\u201d So take that argument up with her.</p> <p>Months ago I foresaw the results that were announced this week and wanted to work with the Labour leadership to do something about it. The king of the mandate holds the cards of power in the Labour party. Without Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s backing and involvement the likelihood of anything happening in selections is nil: I needed Corbyn\u2019s help. I wanted to work with him on this; unity is what I think it\u2019s called. So I sent him a text message asking him to help, it read: \u201cIn the spirit of not speaking publicly without telling you my concerns. I am very worried that all Lab mayors will end up being men unless we do something. Perhaps we could have chat about that this week. Jess\u201d He ignored me. So I tried a woman in his office with whom I\u2019ve always had good relations. I wrote to her: \u201cHey lovely. I\u2019ve just texted Jeremy and asked for a chat. I think we need strong action and direction from leadership on issue of women mayors. I will feel that the Labour party is not for me and other women if in 2018 we just elect loads of Labour men.\u201d Again, I was ignored.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/aug/09/andy-burnham-labour-mayoral-candidate-greater-manchester-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4q6vv\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2641896\"            data-video-name=\"Andy Burnham wins nomination as Labour's mayoral candidate for  Greater Manchester \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"ITN\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57a9b667e4b0f5d064841c27\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/08/09/160809andyburnham_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/08/09/160809andyburnham.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/08/09/160809andyburnham_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/aug/09/andy-burnham-labour-mayoral-candidate-greater-manchester-video\">Andy Burnham wins nomination as Labour\u2019s mayoral candidate for Greater Manchester \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/07/misogyny-feminism-stop-the-war-jeremy-corbyn\">Why I won\u2019t shut up about misogyny and the left | Jess Phillips</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yes, no doubt he was really busy and just forgot \u2013 we all miss text messages.

          "bodyText": "The Labour candidates for the city region mayors were announced this week. In Liverpool, Greater Manchester and the West Midlands, each one is a man. In the shortlists there was only one woman, Luciana Berger MP. I am not surprised she didn\u2019t win, but I am incredibly disappointed that no woman did. What happened to the party that has for years beaten all other parties on representation of women and achieved so much for women? Justin Trudeau in Canada managed to get a 50/50 cabinet, but not just by giving out any old job to elected women. Years before he became prime minister, he tried to identify good women to run, in order to ensure there were plenty in the pipeline. Research shows that women often underestimate their potential to take on powerful roles, and need a nudge to do so. Trudeau recognised this and set up the Invite her to run campaign. He identified brilliant women from all sorts of backgrounds and asked them to run. He didn\u2019t just sit back wearing a T-shirt with a feminist slogan, being a bit right on. He did something. Deeds not words. There are many who will not like what I\u2019m saying. They will cry out that the best person for the job is what matters. If you sign up for that meritocracy argument, you must also then accept that the fact that women so rarely rise to the top means that we are just not as good as men. Same with black and ethnic minorities, disabled people and all the other people who are not identikit leaders. Others will try to tell me that representation of women in high office is feminism for the middle classes. I kindly point you to the words of Leymah Gbowee who won the Nobel peace prize for her work with women in Liberia. When asked what single thing we could do to improve things for the poorest, most abused women of the world, she answered: \u201cMore women in power.\u201d So take that argument up with her. Months ago I foresaw the results that were announced this week and wanted to work with the Labour leadership to do something about it. The king of the mandate holds the cards of power in the Labour party. Without Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s backing and involvement the likelihood of anything happening in selections is nil: I needed Corbyn\u2019s help. I wanted to work with him on this; unity is what I think it\u2019s called. So I sent him a text message asking him to help, it read: \u201cIn the spirit of not speaking publicly without telling you my concerns. I am very worried that all Lab mayors will end up being men unless we do something. Perhaps we could have chat about that this week. Jess\u201d He ignored me.

I will feel that the Labour party is not for me and other women if in 2018 we just elect loads of Labour men.\u201d Again, I was ignored. Yes, no doubt he was really busy and just forgot \u2013 we all miss text messages. Except whenever I have texted him about anything else, save one example, he has responded within a day.

Police cited in news reports said the operation centred on Aaron Driver, a man in his mid-20s who had sympathised with the Islamic State group on social media and was under a court order not to associate with any terrorist group. The London Free Press newspaper, citing family members, reported that Driver was shot by police after he detonated a device, wounding himself and another person. Senior police said late on Wednesday that the suspect had allegedly planned to carry out a suicide bombing mission in a public area. Driver, originally from Winnipeg, Manitoba, was in February placed on a court-ordered peace bond restricting his movements. He was ordered to stay away from social media and computers and not have contact with Islamic State or similar groups.

He said in February he did not think Canadians should fear him and that people should not be persecuted for their political beliefs, according to CBC news. A police operation continued well into Wednesday night in Strathroy, a southern Ontario town about 140 miles (225km) south-west of Toronto. Irene Lee, whose parents own a convenience store near Driver\u2019s home, said police had arrived on the quiet residential street shortly after 4pm and quickly surrounded the house. \u201cI hear a bomb sound, like a bang \u2013 I was freaking out because this is a small and quiet town,\u201d she said. \u201cAll of a sudden the policemen were yelling \u2018Everyone get into your houses.\u2019\u201d The RCMP said a suspect had been identified and the \u201cproper course of action has been taken\u201d to ensure there was no danger to public safety. The Canadian public safety minister Ralph Goodale said he had spoken to Justin Trudeau, the prime minister, about the events \u201cto confirm that public safety has been and continues to be properly protected\u201d. The RCMP, Canadian Security Intelligence Service and other police and security agencies were involved in the operation, Goodale said. \u201cThese agencies conducted themselves effectively in the circumstances that developed today,\u201d Goodale said. The national terrorism threat level for Canada remained at medium where it had stood since the fall of 2014, Goodale said. With the Associated Press and Reuters",

          "body": "<p>It\u2019s been more than a decade since Joshua Key chose to cross into Canada rather than continue as a US soldier in the Iraq war. But, at times, he still feels as though he\u2019s fighting a war \u2013 one he describes as \u201ca war against my post-traumatic stress disorder, a conflict against my contract with the military and a battle with the Canadian government\u201d.</p> <p>He arrived in Canada in 2005 \u2013 soon after Canada\u2019s then government declared it would not actively participate in the US-led war in Iraq \u2013 following in the footsteps of the up to 90,000 Americans who sought refuge in Canada during the Vietnam war era.</p> <p>But unlike those who poured into Canada in the 1960s and 70s, the estimated 200 Iraq war resisters who arrived decades later found little government support in their bid to stay in Canada. Years after crossing the border, the 15 or so known resisters who remain in Canada live lives coloured with uncertainty, the threat of being deported home to face potential jail time for desertion looming constantly over their new lives.</p> <p>Now they\u2019re calling on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/justin-trudeau\">Justin Trudeau</a>, Canada\u2019s prime minister, and his Liberal government to reverse years of government antagonism and allow them to stay in Canada permanently. </p> <p>As Key seeks to describe the moment when he knew he had to desert the US army, he points an image that continues to haunt him from his eight-month stint in Iraq. </p> <p>A smiling seven-year-old girl had begun approaching him daily while he was on patrol in Ramadi, asking for water and bread. He couldn\u2019t say no, handing over his army rations to her for weeks. \u201cThen one day the little girl comes running across the street with a smile on her face and her head exploded like a mushroom.\u201d She had been killed by a bullet, just 15ft from where Key was standing.</p> <p>During a two-week break in the United States, he asked a military lawyer if there was any way to avoid returning to Iraq. \u201cHe said, \u2018Soldier, you\u2019ve got two choices: you either get back on that plane and go to Iraq or you\u2019re going to prison,\u2019\u201d Key <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmrZlVUE2vM\">told an audience in Winnipeg in 2009. </a></p> <p>Key opted for a third way \u2013 packing his life into a U-Haul and fleeing with his wife and three kids. After more than a year spent in hiding in Philadelphia, the family moved to Canada.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"67393ae97655e8f6fa406226d5ad7fbb045d5a5c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/67393ae97655e8f6fa406226d5ad7fbb045d5a5c/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rodney Watson calls on the Trudeau government to welcome Iraq war resisters.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rodney Watson calls on the Trudeau government to welcome Iraq war resisters.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Facebook</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Shortly after, the Conservatives came to power in Canada, intent on cracking down on the hundreds of Iraq war resisters in Canada. <a href=\"http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/resources/manuals/bulletins/2010/ob202.asp\">A government order</a> branded them as criminals, leaving some to be deported to face up to 24 months in jail while those who stayed in Canada were denied permanent residency. Others voluntarily returned to the United States. </p> <p>As he campaigned to be prime minister, Trudeau hinted he would do things differently.

          "bodyText": "It\u2019s been more than a decade since Joshua Key chose to cross into Canada rather than continue as a US soldier in the Iraq war. But, at times, he still feels as though he\u2019s fighting a war \u2013 one he describes as \u201ca war against my post-traumatic stress disorder, a conflict against my contract with the military and a battle with the Canadian government\u201d. He arrived in Canada in 2005 \u2013 soon after Canada\u2019s then government declared it would not actively participate in the US-led war in Iraq \u2013 following in the footsteps of the up to 90,000 Americans who sought refuge in Canada during the Vietnam war era. But unlike those who poured into Canada in the 1960s and 70s, the estimated 200 Iraq war resisters who arrived decades later found little government support in their bid to stay in Canada. Years after crossing the border, the 15 or so known resisters who remain in Canada live lives coloured with uncertainty, the threat of being deported home to face potential jail time for desertion looming constantly over their new lives. Now they\u2019re calling on Justin Trudeau, Canada\u2019s prime minister, and his Liberal government to reverse years of government antagonism and allow them to stay in Canada permanently. As Key seeks to describe the moment when he knew he had to desert the US army, he points an image that continues to haunt him from his eight-month stint in Iraq. A smiling seven-year-old girl had begun approaching him daily while he was on patrol in Ramadi, asking for water and bread. He couldn\u2019t say no, handing over his army rations to her for weeks. \u201cThen one day the little girl comes running across the street with a smile on her face and her head exploded like a mushroom.\u201d She had been killed by a bullet, just 15ft from where Key was standing. During a two-week break in the United States, he asked a military lawyer if there was any way to avoid returning to Iraq. \u201cHe said, \u2018Soldier, you\u2019ve got two choices: you either get back on that plane and go to Iraq or you\u2019re going to prison,\u2019\u201d Key told an audience in Winnipeg in 2009. Key opted for a third way \u2013 packing his life into a U-Haul and fleeing with his wife and three kids. After more than a year spent in hiding in Philadelphia, the family moved to Canada. Shortly after, the Conservatives came to power in Canada, intent on cracking down on the hundreds of Iraq war resisters in Canada. A government order branded them as criminals, leaving some to be deported to face up to 24 months in jail while those who stayed in Canada were denied permanent residency. Others voluntarily returned to the United States. As he campaigned to be prime minister, Trudeau hinted he would do things differently. Speaking last year in Winnipeg, he criticised the Conservative government for its lack of compassion and understanding toward the war resisters. \u201cI am supportive of the principle of allowing conscientious objectors to stay,\u201d Trudeau told the crowd. His words echoed those of his father, Pierre Trudeau, who declared Canada to be \u201ca refuge from militarism\u201d during the Vietnam war. Some nine months after Trudeau was elected, Iraq war resisters in Canada continue to live in legal limbo. \u201cI\u2019m shocked and dismayed that it is still going on,\u201d said Dean Walcott, a former US Marine corporal who served four tours in Iraq before escaping to Canada in 2006. He is one of four war resisters whose immigration status is slated to be reviewed by a federal court in November. The court has given the Trudeau government until mid-September to decide whether it wants to continue with the Conservative policy of opposing the resisters\u2019 bid to remain in Canada. When approached for comment on the forthcoming deadline, a spokesperson for the ministry of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship said: \u201cIt would not be appropriate to speculate on future actions the government may take.\u201d Polls suggest most Canadians support the idea of allowing war resisters to stay in the country, with 63% saying in June that they should be allowed to become permanent residents. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is surprising,\u201d said Michelle Robidoux of the War Resisters Support Campaign, which assists Iraq war resisters as they forge new lives in Canada, pointing to Canadians\u2019 widespread opposition to the Iraq war and the welcome extended to resisters during the Vietnam war.

The police at the Secret Garden Party music festival in Cambridgeshire stopped trying to arrest drug-takers and instead stood by supportively as The Loop, a drugs charity, tested party-goers\u2019 illegal substances to ensure they were safe.

The reception was positive. Festival-goers gratefully disposed of batches of drugs shown to be dangerous and responded with interest to the information they were given on drug-use risks while testing was carried out. No one died \u2013 something that couldn\u2019t be said of Perthshire\u2019s T in the Park Festival two weeks earlier, the scene of two suspected drug poisoning deaths.

Last night there was the possibility that the government would use this to return to a more unifying language, to return to the peace talks, to unite the country. But today it looks like they will use [the coup attempt] simply to consolidate power.\u201d</p> <p>The academic said that the trauma of past military interventions, and not sympathy for the government, drove people to oppose Friday night\u2019s bloody coup attempt.</p> <p>\u201cThese people do not support Erdo\u011fan, but they oppose the idea of a military coup. Turkey has a history of very painful, traumatic military interventions, so I was not surprised to see such united opposition to this attempt.\u201d</p> <p>Turkey has faced a number of military coups since the foundation of the republic in 1923. The military, once the most trusted institution in the country, has long defined itself as the guardian of the secular Turkey established by the country\u2019s founder, Mustafa <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/kemal-ataturk\">Kemal Atat\u00fcrk</a>. As recently as 1997, the army intervened and forced Turkey\u2019s first Islamic-led government to resign.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/16/turkey-failed-coup-attempt-public-resistance-president-erdogan\">Defiant Turks stood up for democracy \u2013 but not necessarily for Erdo\u200b\u200b\u011fan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But since 2007, when high-ranking military staff went on trial for an alleged coup attempt, trust in the military has waned considerably, and the AKP has long been credited with pushing the army back into the barracks and establishing civilian rule.</p> <p>\u201cTurkey has experienced a coup once every 10 years. Each time that happened, the country was thrown back by around 50 years,\u201d said Levent G\u00fcltekin, an opposition writer and columnist. \u201cThe deaths, the torture, the horrible scenes in the street \u2013 all this is still very fresh in the collective memory in Turkey, and this memory is easily activated by scares of yet another military intervention.\u201d</p> <p>Evren, who died last year at age 97, left the country with a deeply undemocratic constitution, which, after being implemented in 1982, restricted the right to freedom of assembly and expression, seriously curtailed labour unions and put universities under strict state control.</p> <p>G\u00fcltekin underlined that this was the first time that civilian resistance forced the army to back down from a violent intervention. \u201cThat is of course a good thing. But the real question is how these crowds who professed their loyalty to Erdo\u011fan, will be used,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cSome of the people we saw on the streets are people who do everything Erdo\u011fan asks them to do. He has turned voters into militant followers. It would be a positive development if the government will use them to further democracy, but if they are used to further authoritarianism, it would be a catastrophe.\u201d</p> <p>For the moment, however, fears that Erdo\u011fan will undermine what Turks have achieved were overwhelmed by celebration of that very achievement.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ZiaWeise/status/754397359497318404\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">What defeating a coup sounds like: <a href=\"https://t.co/UWHmvcCN1u\">pic.twitter.com/UWHmvcCN1u</a></p>&mdash; Zia Weise (@ZiaWeise) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ZiaWeise/status/754397359497318404\">July 16, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-578a8027e4b033b610b6e51a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-07-16T19:15:36.020Z\">8.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><em>Anti-coup demonstrators, nearly all of whom draped in the red and white of the Turkish flag, have taken to the streets in cities around the country as their leaders asked them.

In 2007, the military threatened to intervene in a presidential election and warned the government to curb Islamic influences, but the action backfired and Abdullah Gul, the candidate favored by a government with Islamic leanings, took office. The latest coup attempt surprised observers because Erdogan\u2019s government had taken steps to bring the military to heel, including dismissals and prosecutions of high-ranking active and former officers for alleged coup plots. Erdogan\u2019s government appeared to be working effectively with the military, coordinating on national security issues and confronting a perceived anti-government faction said to have infiltrated the police and other institutions.<br></p> <h2>Why would the military try to step in now?</h2> <p>The Turkish military has traditionally seen itself as the guardian of Turkey\u2019s old secular establishment, a legacy of national founder and former army officer Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, as well as an enforcer of order in times of civil unrest and weak civilian leadership. While it was forced to lower its political profile under Erdogan\u2019s government, Turkey\u2019s military has been buffeted by a renewed conflict with Kurdish separatist rebels and bombings by suspected Islamic extremists, including an attack on Istanbul\u2019s main airport last month that killed dozens. Erdogan has also been a polarizing leader, though he commands deep support among a pious Muslim class that once felt marginalized under past military-influenced governments.<br></p> <h2>Why is the Turkish military so important?</h2> <p>Turkey is a NATO member and a key partner in U.S.-led efforts to defeat the Islamic State group, which controls territory in Syria and Iraq, and has allowed American fighter jets to use its Incirlik air base to fly missions against the extremists. Turkey\u2019s strategic location in the Mideast region, straddling the Asian and European continents, makes it a critical player in international conflicts. In 2003, Turkey barred U.S. forces from using its territory in the invasion of Iraq, raising questions about whether the politically powerful Turkish military had undercut a civilian-led initiative to help the Americans.<br></p> <h2>What do Turks think about their military?</h2> <p>Turks have a conflicted relationship with their military, an institution that is cloaked in the lore of sacrifice, but also tarnished as a past symbol of repression. Past military coup leaders have been seen as saviors from chaos and corruption, but also ruthless. In the 1960 military takeover, the prime minister and key ministers were executed. Torture, disappearances and extrajudicial killings were rampant in a 1980 coup. Despite that past, the military retains respect and vast economic resources.

The budget airline says the schedule \u201cwill be kept under continuous review\u201d.</p> <h2>Nato</h2> <p>Nato\u2019s chief says all alliance personnel and military units in Turkey are \u201csafe and secure\u201d following the attempted coup.</p> <p>Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said in a Twitter post that he had spoken to Nato\u2019s supreme commander, US Army Gen Curtis M Scapparrotti, who \u201cconfirms that all Nato personnel and units in Turkey are safe and secure\u201d.</p> <p>The alliance chief also tweeted that he welcomed \u201cthe strong support shown by the people and all political parties to democracy and to the democratically elected government of Turkey\u201d.</p> <h2>Spain</h2> <p>Spain\u2019s acting foreign minister, Jose Manuel Garcia Margallo, condemned the attempted coup, telling Spanish national television that his government completely supports the Turkish government headed by President Erdogan.</p> <p>He said: \u201cWithout a doubt we support respecting the constitution and democratically elected institutions, and we condemn all coups without reservation.\u201d</p> <p>Garcia Margallo spoke by telephone from Mongolia, where he is attending the ASEM Asia-Europe Meeting.</p> <h2>Syrian opposition</h2> <p>The exiled Syrian opposition congratulated the Turkish people for halting the attempted military coup.<br></p> <p>The Turkey-based Syrian National Coalition said Turkey has protected its democratic institutions \u201cin the face of dark and desperate attempts that sought to take control of the popular will\u201d.</p> <p>It says the Turkish people value democracy and \u201cwill not let a group of putschists take it away in a desperate attempt to restore military rule\u201d.</p> <p>Turkey has been one of the main backers of the uprising against the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, and is hosting 2.7 million Syrian refugees.</p> <p>In the early hours of the attempted coup, celebratory gunfire broke out across Damascus. The government and its supporters view the rebels as terrorists and consider Turkey to be one of their chief sponsors.</p> <h2>Hamas</h2> <p>The Islamic militant group Hamas has congratulated Erdogan for quashing a \u201cvicious\u201d plot to overthrow him.</p> <p>The Turkish leader has been a staunch supporter of Hamas and a fierce critic of Israel. Hamas says it remembers Turkey\u2019s \u201cwise leadership in supporting the Palestinian people and their cause\u201d and working to lift the blockade on Gaza, the coastal territory ruled by the group.</p> <p>Hamas supporters took to the streets in several places across the Gaza Strip to celebrate the failure of the coup, raising Turkish flags and posters bearing Erdogan\u2019s image.</p> <p>Turkey recently restored ties with Israel after a six-year lull following a deadly Israeli naval raid to stop an activist flotilla aiming to breach the Gaza blockade.</p> <h2>Qatar</h2> <p>The Gulf nation of Qatar, which has close ties to Erdogan\u2019s government, was quick to condemn the military coup attempt.</p> <p>It called the attempted coup a \u201cviolation of the constitutional legitimacy\u201d in Turkey and said it supports all legal measures the government takes to maintain security and stability.</p> <p>The official Qatar News Agency said the ruling emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, has spoken with Erdogan by phone to express Qatar\u2019s support.</p> <p>Qatar and Turkey have grown increasingly close in recent years, and share similar stances on their support for Syrian rebel groups and the Muslim Brotherhood. The two countries agreed last year to establish a Turkish military base in Qatar.</p> <h2>Iran</h2> <p>Iran said the attempted military coup in Turkey was \u201cdoomed to fail\u201d.</p> <p>The foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, was quoted by the official IRNA news agency as praising the \u201cbrave defence by the people of Turkey of their democracy and elected government\u201d.</p> <p>He said the events in neighbouring Turkey prove \u201cthat coup d\u2019\u00e9tat has no place and is doomed to fail in our region\u201d.</p> <h2>Pakistan</h2> <p>An aide to prime minister Nawaz Sharif condemned the attempted coup in a statement and said Pakistan \u201chopes that peace and normalcy will be restored in Turkey\u201d.</p> <p>Tariq Fatimi also said he had contacted Turkey\u2019s foreign minister to express solidarity with Turkey\u2019s government and democratic institutions.</p> <p>Pakistan\u2019s main political parties have also praised the people of Turkey for foiling the coup.</p> <p>Sharif was himself overthrown in a 1999 coup led by Gen. Pervez Musharraf, who ruled Pakistan until 2008.</p> <h2>Afghanistan</h2> <p>President Ashraf Ghani expressed support for Turkey\u2019s elected government, saying in a statement that \u201cdemocratic elections are the most effective means for peaceful transfer of power\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cMilitaristic options will only undermine democratic institutions, stability and development in the country,\u201d the statement from Ghani\u2019s office said.</p> <h2>Azerbaijan</h2> <p>The president of Turkey\u2019s neighbor Azerbaijan condemned the attempted coup.</p> <p>President Ilham Aliev was concerned about developments in Turkey and \u201cwelcomed measures taken to prevent the attempt at a coup and to stabilise the situation,\u201d spokesman Ali Hasanov said.</p> <p>Azerbaijan is a Turkic nation and its late president Geidar Aliev once described their relations as \u201cone nation, two states\u201d \u2013 a phrase later echoed by TErdogan.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-07-16T12:49:49.138Z\">at 1.49pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-578a12a9e4b08239dbab79b4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/helenasmith\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-07-16T10:56:33.569Z\">11.56am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In Greece, our correspondent Helena Smith is being told that the eight Turkish military personnel who sought asylum in the northern Greek town of Alexandoupolis have removed all insignia from their uniforms, making it impossible to know their ranks.

So Is there any truth in it?</p> <p>The traditional rivalry in Turkish society has been between secularists who look to the modern state\u2019s founder <strong>Kemal Ataturk </strong>\u2013 notably the army and other state institutions \u2013 and Islamists.<br></p> <p>So who are the G\u00fclenists? G\u00fclen, a cleric living in exile in Pennsylvania, leads a popular movement \u2013 Hizmet or \u201cthe service\u201d \u2013 ostensibly campaigning for democratic accountability.<br></p> <p>The centre of recent tension between the G\u00fclenists and Erdo\u011fan and his AKP is the president\u2019s decision to blame G\u00fclenists in the police and judiciary for initiating anti-corruption allegations in 2013 that targeted his supporters, including Erdo\u011fan\u2019s son Bilal.</p> <p>Erdo\u011fan responded by launching a purge of perceived G\u00fclenists.</p> <p>As the coup attempt unfolded on Friday night, a lawyer for the Turkish government, <strong>Robert Amsterdam</strong>, said \u201cthere are indications of direct involvement\u201d of G\u00fclenists. According to Turkish intelligence sources, Amsterdam said: \u201cThere are signs that G\u00fclen is working closely with certain members of military leadership against the elected civilian government.\u201d</p> <p>G\u00fclen\u2019s group, the Alliance for Shared Values, was quick to deny it, issuing a statement saying comments alleging the group\u2019s involvement in the coup were \u201chighly irresponsible\u201d and that the group did not support the military intervention:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Events on the ground are moving quickly and it would be irresponsible for us to speculate on them. We remain concerned about the safety and security of Turkish citizens and those in Turkey right now.</p> <p>For more than 40 years, <strong>Fethullah G\u00fclen </strong>and Hizmet participants have advocated for, and demonstrated their commitment to, peace and democracy.</p> <p>We have consistently denounced military interventions in domestic politics.

Right now the question is whether the attempted coup is from the top command, with the top brass involved, or a colonel-level or officer-coup, from a certain segment of the army.

          "bodyText": "We\u2019re going to pause our live coverage of the failed coup by a Turkish military faction, its defeat at the hands of protesters, police and loyalists, and the subsequent crackdown in the military and courts by victorious president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. The attempted coup On Friday night a faction of the Turkish military tried and failed to stage a coup to overthrow Erdo\u011fan, and tanks, helicopters and soldiers clashed with police and protesters in the streets of Istanbul and Ankara. Erdo\u011fan delivered an iPhone address to the nation, calling on people to resist the coup and defend their democracy. Thousands turned out, and the president landed in Istanbul, where he denounced the \u201ctreason\u201d by the rebellious faction. Parliament was struck by at least one bomb, and graphic videos and photos social media showed clashes, surrenders and chaos. Helicopters fired at people on the ground, mobs grappled with soldiers, and tanks barreled through crowds or were overrun by protesters. On Saturday the defense minister said the control was fully in control of the government. At least 265 people were killed in the violence and at least 1,440 wounded. Prime minister Binali Yildirim said on Saturday that 161 \u201cmartyrs\u201d were killed, including civilians and police. The general acting as chief of staff, Umit Dundar, said earlier in the day that 104 \u201ccoup plotters\u201d were killed in the fighting. Barack Obama, Angela Merkel and other world leaders condemned the coup. \u201cAll parties in Turkey should support the democratically-elected government of Turkey, show restraint, and avoid any violence or bloodshed,\u201d the US president said. The aftermath Authorities arrested 2,839 army members and ordered 2,745 judges and prosecutors detained, as officials began to purge the ranks of accused conspirators. Erdo\u011fan demanded that Obama arrest or deport an exiled cleric, Fethullah G\u00fclen, from his home in Pennsylvania. Secretary of state John Kerry said the US would consider extradition but required evidence of the imam\u2019s wrongdoing. G\u00fclen rejected the conspiracy accusations in a rare interview with the Guardian and other reporters, and suggested that Erdo\u011fan could have staged the coup. He also condemned the coup attempt, saying, \u201cnow that Turkey is on the path to democracy, it cannot turn back.\u201d Turkey shut down US military flights from a base near the southern border, which the foreign minister said was because conspirators had been stationed there. He promised that air strikes from the base would resume after anti-coup operations, but the halt has disrupted the campaign against jihadi militants in Syria. Yildirim said that Turkey would consider reinstating the death penalty to punish coup-plotters and the \u201cblack stain\u201d they had left on the nation\u2019s democracy. Turkey\u2019s four major parties denounced the attempted coup, including those that have vehemently opposed Erdo\u011fan\u2019s AKP. But fears remained that the pro-democracy protests may have emboldened Erdo\u011fan\u2019s increasing authoritarianism. Anti-coup demonstrations returned to the streets of Istanbul and Ankara, where police restored order and a celebratory mood reigned. Injured people still waited for medical care at Ankara\u2019s biggest hospital, and people recounted scenes of horror and death from clashes with tanks and soldiers the night before. Two Turkish majors, a captain and five privates requested asylum in Greece after landing in a military helicopter. Greece\u2019s defense ministry acknowledged a landing near Alexandroupolis, and said the passengers were arrested for illegal entry. Defense minister Fikri Isik has said forces loyal to president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan have regained full control of all areas in Turkey, but warned that authorities will stay on high alert for any continued threat. AP reports: The uprising appears not to have been backed by the most senior ranks of the military. General Umit Dundar said the plotters were mainly officers from the Air Force, the military police and the armored units. But Turkish authorities have detained General Adem Huduti, commander of the Second Army, and Alparslan Altan, one of the judges on Turkey\u2019s highest court. There are also unconfirmed reports that General Erdal Ozturk, commander of the Third Army Corps, was detained, according to an unnamed official cited by Reuters. What is the G\u00fclenist movement, and why does Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan consider it an existential threat? My colleagues in London explain, and Amana Fontanella-Khan reports from Fethullah G\u00fclen\u2019s compound in central Pennsylvania. Peaceful demonstrations are continuing around Turkey \u2013 with remnants of the attempted coup still standing scattered on the streets and the question hovering of how far will Erdo\u011fan go in his retaliation. Defiant Turks defended their democracy on Friday night \u2013 but not necessarily the man elected by that democracy, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, the Guardian\u2019s Istanbul correspondent Constanze Letsch reports. \u201cThe resistance against the coup attempt last night was quite heterogenic,\u201d said Erol \u00d6nderoglu, Turkey\u2019s Reporters Without Borders representative who is currently on trial on terrorist propaganda charges after participating in a solidarity campaign with a pro-Kurdish newspaper.\u201cThe most valuable outcome of last night\u2019s events is that many people who are not AKP supporters stood up for democratic values despite the recent crackdowns on the opposition, and despite the tension and the polarisation of the country.\u201d However, not everyone shared his optimism. \u201cEveryone spoke out against the coup last night and that gave me hope,\u201d said an academic who wished to remain anonymous. \u201cBut watching events unfold today this hope has shrunk quickly. Last night there was the possibility that the government would use this to return to a more unifying language, to return to the peace talks, to unite the country. But today it looks like they will use [the coup attempt] simply to consolidate power.\u201d The academic said that the trauma of past military interventions, and not sympathy for the government, drove people to oppose Friday night\u2019s bloody coup attempt. \u201cThese people do not support Erdo\u011fan, but they oppose the idea of a military coup. Turkey has a history of very painful, traumatic military interventions, so I was not surprised to see such united opposition to this attempt.\u201d Turkey has faced a number of military coups since the foundation of the republic in 1923. The military, once the most trusted institution in the country, has long defined itself as the guardian of the secular Turkey established by the country\u2019s founder, Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk. As recently as 1997, the army intervened and forced Turkey\u2019s first Islamic-led government to resign. But since 2007, when high-ranking military staff went on trial for an alleged coup attempt, trust in the military has waned considerably, and the AKP has long been credited with pushing the army back into the barracks and establishing civilian rule. \u201cTurkey has experienced a coup once every 10 years. Each time that happened, the country was thrown back by around 50 years,\u201d said Levent G\u00fcltekin, an opposition writer and columnist. \u201cThe deaths, the torture, the horrible scenes in the street \u2013 all this is still very fresh in the collective memory in Turkey, and this memory is easily activated by scares of yet another military intervention.\u201d Evren, who died last year at age 97, left the country with a deeply undemocratic constitution, which, after being implemented in 1982, restricted the right to freedom of assembly and expression, seriously curtailed labour unions and put universities under strict state control. G\u00fcltekin underlined that this was the first time that civilian resistance forced the army to back down from a violent intervention. \u201cThat is of course a good thing. But the real question is how these crowds who professed their loyalty to Erdo\u011fan, will be used,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of the people we saw on the streets are people who do everything Erdo\u011fan asks them to do. He has turned voters into militant followers. It would be a positive development if the government will use them to further democracy, but if they are used to further authoritarianism, it would be a catastrophe.\u201d For the moment, however, fears that Erdo\u011fan will undermine what Turks have achieved were overwhelmed by celebration of that very achievement. Anti-coup demonstrators, nearly all of whom draped in the red and white of the Turkish flag, have taken to the streets in cities around the country as their leaders asked them. Earlier on Saturday the president and prime minister called on people to return to pro-democracy demonstrations in case of a \u201csecond coup\u201d attempt. My colleague Kareem Shaheen is in the capital, Ankara, and Ghaith Abdul-Ahad is in Kassimpasa, president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s Istanbul neighborhood. Large crowds of several thousand people have gathered in Ankara\u2019s central Kilizay Square, where Prime Minister Binali Yildirim was scheduled to make an appearance \u2013 but failed to show. The crowd hung around with several large portraits of Erdogan declaring him \u201cBenim Baskanim\u201d \u2013 \u201cmy president\u201d. In Kassimpasa, flag waving crowds of mostly religious and conservative people \u2013 the backbone of Erdo\u011fan\u2019s ruling AKP party \u2013 were whipped to a frenzy by a speaker telling them: \u201cyou stood for your neighbor! Recent Tayyip is our son, and we went into the street to defend him!\u201d The crowd responded with songs repeating Erdo\u011fan\u2019s name, kids on motorbikes drove by waving flags and chanting and a stocky and bearded religious student named Emirrat said he would not leave the celebration for anything. \u201cI haven\u2019t slept for 29 hours, this a very good day for us but the struggle will continue.\u201d Elsewhere in Istanbul, crowds have swarmed onto the main thoroughfares and most famous streets of the city. As night falls almost a full day after a group within the military tried to stage a coup, president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan has reasserted control, detained thousands of people in the military and courts, and demanded that Barack Obama arrest or deport a political opponent. On Friday night a faction of the Turkish military tried and failed to stage a coup to overthrow Erdo\u011fan, and sent tanks, helicopters and soldiers clashed with police and protesters in the streets of Istanbul and Ankara. An estimated 265 people were killed in the violence, though authorities have given distinct tallies. Prime minister Binali Yildirim said on Saturday that 161 \u201cmartyrs\u201d were killed, including civilians and police, and that at least 1,440 people were wounded. The general acting as chief of staff, Umit Dundar, said earlier in the day that 104 \u201ccoup plotters\u201d were killed in the fighting. Loyalists arrested 2,839 army members and ordered detained 2,745 judges and prosecutors, as Erdo\u011fan\u2019s government began to purge the government and military ranks of suspected dissidents. Erdo\u011fan demanded that Barack Obama arrest or deport an exiled cleric, Fethullah G\u00fclen, from his home in Pennsylvania. Secretary of state John Kerry said the US would consider extradition but required evidence of the imam\u2019s wrongdoing. G\u00fclen rejected the conspiracy accusations in a rare interview with the Guardian and other reporters, and suggested that Erdo\u011fan could have staged the coup. He also condemned the coup attempt, saying, \u201cNow that Turkey is on the path to democracy, it cannot turn back.\u201d Yildirim said that Turkey would consider reinstating the death penalty to punish coup-plotters and the \u201cblack stain\u201d they had left on the nation\u2019s democracy. Erdo\u011fan, in Istanbul after an extraordinary iPhone address on Friday, vowed to \u201cclean up\u201d the military and government of enemies. Anti-coup demonstrations returned to the streets of Istanbul and Ankara, where police restored order and soldiers surrendered in tense scenes around the cities. Injured people still waited for medical care at Ankara\u2019s biggest hospital, and people recounted scenes of horror and death from clashes with tanks and soldiers the night before. Parliament resumed sessions amid rubble from at least one explosion Friday, and all the major parties, including those that have vehemently opposed Erdo\u011fan\u2019s AKP, denounced the attempted coup. Two Turkish majors, a captain and five privates requested asylum in Greece after landing in a military helicopter. Greece\u2019s defense ministry acknowledged a landing near Alexandroupolis, and said the passengers were arrested for illegal entry. The Pentagon lost Turkish airspace access and was forced to stop flying from a southern base, which Ankara\u2019s foreign minister explained by saying that suspected coup plotters were arrested at the base. He promised that counter-terror cooperation would resume as normal after anti-coup operations ended. Barack Obama, Angela Merkel, Donald Tusk and other world leaders condemned the coup in emphatic terms. \u201cAll parties in Turkey should support the democratically-elected government of Turkey, show restraint, and avoid any violence or bloodshed,\u201d the US president said in a statement. At Numune hospital, the largest in Ankara, hundreds of wounded people have been brought for treatment, my colleague Kareem Shaheen reports. Cagri, a 29-year-old, was wounded by shrapnel when a military helicopter fired at loyalist security forces in his neighborhood of Kazan. \u201cWe just panicked,\u201d he said. A friend of his who was 2 miles away died in the fire from helicopter machine guns, he said. A taxi driver nearby grabbed him and took him to the hospital, where he had to lie down outside waiting to be treated because of the huge crowds of victims seeking help. Another friend lost his hand, Cagri said, his own shrapnel wounds in his chest and leg, bandaged. He added that has lost all feeling in his injured thigh. Osman Konmaz, an EMT, said he treated between 350 to 400 people in the attack\u2019s aftermath. He described the most heartbreaking cases he saw: one man who lost his leg after it was run over by a tank, and another when he saw the body of a man who was crushed by a tank controlled by the coup plotters. \u201cThere was no humanity in any of this,\u201d he said. Most of the injuries he saw were wounds from shrapnel or bullets. He said the incident took a grave psychological toll, and was even worse than the attack in Ankara last October by Isis that targeted a peace rally. \u201cThis was the worst massacre I\u2019ve ever witnessed,\u201d he said, before alluding to a bombing months earlier. \u201cAt least October 10 was terror by a terrorist group, but this was done by our own military.\u201d Meanwhile people continued to gather at Kizilay Square, where prime minister Binali Yildirim is set to speak to the crowds. People have started amassing in the streets and squares of Ankara, my colleague Kareem Shaheen reports from Kizilay Square, which is awash in waves of red Turkish flags. There\u2019s a carnival like atmosphere and a couple thousand protesters in Ankara\u2019s Kizilay square, celebrating the coup\u2019s defeat. Under towering portraits of President Erdogan that declare \u201cwe own democracy.\u201d Protesters are chanting \u201cthe martyrs will not die, the country won\u2019t be divided,\u201d \u201cGod is great,\u201d and praising Erdogan amid music and jubilant flag waving. One chant said: \u201cThere is no left or right wing, only Ankara, the last castle.\u201d Ahmet, a 23-year-old protester, said he came to the demonstrations to stand alongside the elected president, saying he had also joined civilians who marched upon the presidential palace last night against the military. \u201cWe are here together against it, and if they try a second time, we will stay here,\u201d he said A young couple who requested anonymity said they saw their presence as a defence of the homeland. \u201cThey tried to divide our country,\u201d said the man. \u201cThis is about our homeland and we will die for it, and they shot at us with their helicopters and their jets flew over our heads.\u201d The couple urged greater cooperation between Turkey\u2019s political factions, saying the whole country was \u201cone heart\u201d in the immediate aftermath of the coup attempt. In a rare interview with a small group of journalists at his residence in Saylorsburg, Pennsylvania, the reclusive Fethullah G\u00fclen has told my colleague Amana Fontanella-Khan that he rejects all accusations that he was behind Friday\u2019s coup attempt. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that the world believes the accusations made by President Erdo\u011fan,\u201d G\u00fclen said. \u201cThere is a possibility that it could be a staged coup and it could be meant for further accusations [against the Gulenists],\u201d he said, a small prayer room, lined with woven rugs, decorated with Islamic calligraphy and leather bound religious books. G\u00fclen said he rejects all military interventions, and said he has personally suffered every time a coup has happened in Turkey in recent years. \u201cNow that Turkey is on the path to democracy, it cannot turn back,\u201d he said. The last time the reclusive leader of the G\u00fclen movement spoke live to international press was in 2014. G\u00fclen rarely leaves the Golden Generation Worship and Retreat Center complex, where his movement offers religious instruction. The exiled imam is in fragile health. Before the interview he was attended to by a stethoscope-carrying physician who measured his blood pressure. The sprawling compound is guarded by around the clock security. Following the news of the coup, Alp Aslandogan, the executive director of Alliance for Shared Values, and the media advisor to G\u00fclen, said that security is on \u201chigh alert\u201d following threats of violence on social media. While Erdo\u011fan is attempting to extradite G\u00fclen for charges related to the coup Aslandogan said: \u201cThe US government position has always been that if there is any evidence of Mr Gulen breaking the laws, they will look into it. \u201cSo far, the Turkish government hasn\u2019t produced anything. Thank God, this is a country of laws, and we depend on that.\u201d Elaborating on the idea that Erdo\u011fan may have staged a coup, Aslandogan noted Friday\u2019s events did not match the pattern previous coups have followed: \u201cThe coup appears to be poorly planned, very poorly executed and everything seems to be paying into Erdogan\u2019s hands.\u201d \u201cThere are many big question marks of how [this attempted coup] was executed,\u201d he added. The crowd shouts to Erdo\u011fan that it wants the death penalty for coup plotters \u2013 the president responds by saying \u201cthese demands may be discussed in parliament\u201d. Turkey\u2019s prime minister has already hinted that the country may reinstate the death penalty, fully abolished in 2004 under Erdo\u011fan\u2019s administration, may be restored. Erdo\u011fan pauses as minarets sound in the background. Then he declares: \u201cthe army is ours, not that of the parallel structure \u2013 I am the chief commander!\u201d He promises he will \u201cclean out\u201d coup supporters from the military and government. Then Erdo\u011fan again brings up G\u00fclen, saying that the US should cooperate with his demands and that Turkey has extradited terrorists demanded by American officials. Once this \u201chead of terror\u201d is removed from exile, Erdo\u011fan says, Turkey can have true change. President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan is speaking from Istanbul, where he calls on Barack Obama to arrest cleric Fethullah G\u00fclen or deport him to Turkey to face charges related to the coup. He says that if the US and Turkey are truly strategic allies, then the American president will help Erdo\u011fan with regard to the exiled imam, who lives in central Pennsylvania. Erdo\u011fan then says that the attempted coup was perpetrated by a minority within the army, but not the military in general. More than 2,800 service members have been arrested so far and there are reports of more arrests around Turkey. Erdo\u011fan\u2019s government has also removed more than 2,700 judges and prosecutors from duty. Earlier on Saturday secretary of state John Kerry said the US would consider an extradition request, but had not yet received one and would require evidence of wrongdoing. Calm fell on Ankara in the aftermath of chaos and battles with soldiers, my colleague Kareem Shaheen reports, but the city anticipates new demonstrations as night falls and the weather cools. Crowds are relatively thin and resting near the parliament and military headquarters in anticipation of the big demonstration later this evening. There are regular and plainclothes policemen in the central area who have established a security cordon around the parliament and the military headquarters, both of which were damaged in attacks during the coup. I witnessed a debate between two police officers and a group of civilians \u2013 one of the police officers was telling them the regular soldiers aren\u2019t to blame because they were just following orders. But a woman who was debating them said she blamed them for opening fire on civilians and expressed outrage that they had taken such a step. As the group dispersed, one of the police officers said: \u201cLet\u2019s show them today how strong we are.\u201d American military flights have been halted at the Incirlik Air Base in southern Turkey, according to the Pentagon. \u201cThe Turkish government has closed its airspace to military aircraft, and as a result air operations at Incirlik Air Base have been halted at this time,\u201d spokesperson Peter Cook said in a statement. \u201cOfficials are working with the Turks to resume air operations there as soon as possible. In the meantime, US Central Command is adjusting flight operations in the counter-ISIL campaign to minimize any effects on the campaign. US facilities at Incirlik are operating on internal power sources and a loss of commercial power to the base has not affected base operations.\u201d Turkey\u2019s foreign minister Mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu has said that coup plotters were at the air base and have been arrested, Reuters reports. \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu promised the anti-terror campaign will resume once anti-coup operations have ended. He added that he\u2019s spoken to US secretary of state John Kerry and stressed to him that the coup was launched by a network associated with exiled cleric Fethullah G\u00fclen. In 2015 Turkey agreed to let the US fly military strikes out of the base against jihadi militants in Syria and Iraq. Earlier on Saturday Kerry said that \u201cas of this moment\u201d Turkey\u2019s coordination with the US on counter-terrorism was unchanged. \u201cTurkey\u2019s cooperation with us with our coutner-terrorism efforts, in our Nato obligations and in our regional efforts with respect to Syria and Isis have not been affected negatively,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of that has continued as before.\u201d The White House does not know of any Americans killed or injured in clashes overnight in Turkey, according to a statement on Barack Obama\u2019s latest briefing. In the statement Obama reiterates the need for continued coordination with Turkey, with which the US relies on for military and intelligence support and stemming the flow of refugees from Syria. \u201cThe president this morning received an update from his national security and broader foreign policy team on the situation in Turkey. The president\u2019s advisers apprised him of the most recent developments on the ground, and the president instructed his team to continue to work with their Turkish counterparts to maintain the safety and well-being of diplomatic missions and personnel, US servicemembers and their dependents. \u201cWhile we have no indications as of yet that Americans were killed or injured in the violence, the president and his team lamented the loss of life and registered the vital need for all parties in Turkey to act within the rule of law and to avoid actions that would lead to further violence or instability. The president also underscored the shared challenges that will require continued Turkish cooperation, including our joint efforts against terrorism.\u201d Turkish authorities have detained one of the military\u2019s top generals and a member of the nation\u2019s highest court, according to Anadolu news and CNN T\u00fcrk. Reuters has background on the officials: General Adem Huduti is the most senior officer to be apprehended so far following the attempted intervention that killed more than 160 people. The Second Army, based in Malatya, protects Turkey\u2019s borders with Syria, Iraq and Iran. Alparslan Altan is a member of the country\u2019s top court and the most senior judicial figure among scores of civilians detained so far. Nearly 18 hours after Turkish tanks and soldiers first closed bridges in Istanbul and a group within the military declared itself in control to \u201cto reinstall the constitutional order, democracy, human rights and freedoms\u201d, the coup has failed and the backlash begun. A faction of the Turkish military tried and failed to stage a coup to overthrow president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, and sent tanks and soldiers into the streets of Istanbul and Ankara, where they clashed with ultimately successful protesters. Around 200 people at minimum were killed in the violence, though authorities have given distinct tallies. Prime minister Binali Yildirim said on Saturday that 161 \u201cmartyrs\u201d were killed, including civilians and police, and that at least 1,440 people were wounded. The general acting as chief of staff, Umit Dundar, said earlier in the day that 104 \u201ccoup plotters\u201d were killed in the fighting. Loyalists arrested 2,839 army members and removed 2,745 judges from duty, according to authorities and broadcaster NTV, as Erdo\u011fan\u2019s government began to purge the government and military of suspected dissidents. Erdo\u011fan returned to Istanbul after an extraordinary iPhone address that called people to the streets, and said that the attempted coup was \u201ctreason\u201d by \u201ca minority within our armed forces\u201d. Yildirim said that Turkey would consider reinstating the death penalty to punish coup-plotters and the \u201cblack stain\u201d they had left on the nation\u2019s democracy. Tensions remained high in some areas, with police preparing for more demonstrations overnight. Soldiers surrendered en masse in and around Istanbul, including 50 soldiers on the Bosphorus Bridge who abandoned their tanks and weapons in the face of crowds. The US diplomatic personnel confirmed social media videos and photos of sporadic gunfire and violence around Istanbul and Ankara. Turkish ministers returned to parliament, where at least one bomb had exploded on Friday night and where sections of the building lie in ruin. The head of the armed forces, General Hulusi Akar, who was reportedly freed from captivity. Erdo\u011fan and Yildirim accused an exiled cleric, Fethullah G\u00fclen, of organizing the plot from his home in Pennsylvania. G\u00fclen denied the charges and condemned the coup, and US secretary of state John Kerry said the US would consider extradition but required evidence of the imam\u2019s wrongdoing. Two Turkish majors, a captain and five privates requested asylum in Greece after landing in a military helicopter. Greece\u2019s defense ministry acknowledged a landing near Alexandroupolis, and said the passengers were arrested for illegal entry. Barack Obama, Angela Merkel, Donald Tusk and other world leaders condemned the coup in emphatic terms. All of Turkey\u2019s major political parties, including those that have vehemently opposed Erdo\u011fan\u2019s AKP, also denounced the attempted coup. Any country that stands by exiled cleric Fethullah Gulen will be considered an enemy of Turkey, Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim has said in remarks reported by Reuters. Yildirim and president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan have accused Gulen, who lives at a remote compound in central Pennsylvania, of orchestrating the coup with a faction of the military. They have said that Gulen created a \u201cparallel structure\u201d within the courts, media and military. Gulen has condemned \u201cin the strongest terms the attempted military coup\u201d and \u201ccategorically\u201d denied any involvement. \u201cGovernment should be won through a process of free and fair elections, not force,\u201d he said in a statement. Speaking in parliament, Yildirim also said that he hopes Turkey\u2019s political parties will be able to set aside their past enmity and have a \u201cnew start\u201d together. American secretary of state John Kerry said earlier on Saturday that the US has not received any extradition request and would hear a petition. But he made clear that the US would require evidence of Gulen\u2019s wrongdoing. \u201cI\u2019m sure people will wonder about allegations of who may have instigated this and where support came from,\u201d he said. \u201cThe United States will obviously be supportive of any legitimate investigative efforts and under due process and within the law, we will be completely supportive of efforts to assist the government if they so request.\u201d Kerry added that he hopes: \u201cthat there will be a constitutional process, and a legal process, that will deal appropriately with coup-plotters.\u201d In Ankara my colleague Kareem Shaheen is with the scores of people celebrating in the aftermath of the failed coup \u2013 he reports that police and the loyal military factions are preparing for more trouble later today, despite the joyous atmosphere. Turkey\u2019s main opposition Republican People\u2019s Party (CHP) leader, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, said that the community should have a unified reaction to every coup attempt, according to the state-run news agency. Speaking to Turkey\u2019s private news channel NTV, Kilicidaroglu took a stand against a military coup attempt, Anadolu agency. \u201cCommunity should give joint reaction to every coup attempt,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, whoever does, wherever it comes, we should take a joint stand against the coup as we take a joint stand against terrorism.\u201d The head of the Turkish Nationalist Party (MHP) Devlet Bahceli made a telephone call to Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim and said the attempted coup was not acceptable, according to a report from the Turkish state-run agency. According to a statement form the Turkish Prime Ministry, Bahceli said his party is in solidarity with Turkish Republic, Anadolu agency reports. In a written statement, Bahceli said an attempt at suspending democracy and ignoring the national will is a big mistake against Turkey. \u201cThe price Turkey will pay will be considerably high in the event of a civil war in Turkey. As Turkish people, we need to be distant to all kinds of interventions risking our national unity and integrity,\u201d he said. In a joint written statement, People\u2019s Democratic Party (HDP) co-chairs, Selehattin Demirtas and Figen Yuksekdag, said: \u201cHDP takes a stand against every coup in every condition.\u201d \u201cThere is no way beside protecting the democratic politics,\u201d it added. Hundreds of people waving Turkish flags have gathered outside of the parliament in Ankara to protest the coup attempt as legislators prepare to hold an emergency session, AP reports. In an unprecedented show of unity, all four parties represented in parliament are expected to issue a joint declaration Saturday condemning the attempted coup against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s government. The extraordinary session began with a minute of silence in honor of those who lost their lives during the coup, followed by the singing of the national anthem. The Associated Press has taken a look at Turkey\u2019s long history of coups here: How long has the military intervened in politics? The military staged three coups between 1960 and 1980 and pressured Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan, a pious Muslim mentor of Erdogan who was disliked by Turkey\u2019s secular establishment, out of power in 1997. In 2007, the military threatened to intervene in a presidential election and warned the government to curb Islamic influences, but the action backfired and Abdullah Gul, the candidate favored by a government with Islamic leanings, took office. The latest coup attempt surprised observers because Erdogan\u2019s government had taken steps to bring the military to heel, including dismissals and prosecutions of high-ranking active and former officers for alleged coup plots. Erdogan\u2019s government appeared to be working effectively with the military, coordinating on national security issues and confronting a perceived anti-government faction said to have infiltrated the police and other institutions. Why would the military try to step in now? The Turkish military has traditionally seen itself as the guardian of Turkey\u2019s old secular establishment, a legacy of national founder and former army officer Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, as well as an enforcer of order in times of civil unrest and weak civilian leadership. While it was forced to lower its political profile under Erdogan\u2019s government, Turkey\u2019s military has been buffeted by a renewed conflict with Kurdish separatist rebels and bombings by suspected Islamic extremists, including an attack on Istanbul\u2019s main airport last month that killed dozens. Erdogan has also been a polarizing leader, though he commands deep support among a pious Muslim class that once felt marginalized under past military-influenced governments. Why is the Turkish military so important? Turkey is a NATO member and a key partner in U.S.-led efforts to defeat the Islamic State group, which controls territory in Syria and Iraq, and has allowed American fighter jets to use its Incirlik air base to fly missions against the extremists. Turkey\u2019s strategic location in the Mideast region, straddling the Asian and European continents, makes it a critical player in international conflicts. In 2003, Turkey barred U.S. forces from using its territory in the invasion of Iraq, raising questions about whether the politically powerful Turkish military had undercut a civilian-led initiative to help the Americans. What do Turks think about their military? Turks have a conflicted relationship with their military, an institution that is cloaked in the lore of sacrifice, but also tarnished as a past symbol of repression. Past military coup leaders have been seen as saviors from chaos and corruption, but also ruthless. In the 1960 military takeover, the prime minister and key ministers were executed. Torture, disappearances and extrajudicial killings were rampant in a 1980 coup. Despite that past, the military retains respect and vast economic resources. Service is a rite of passage for almost all men, who serve as conscripts. Soldiers who die in fighting with Kurdish rebels are hailed as martyrs. Demonstrators against the coup have gathered in the Turkish capital of Ankara waving flags and singing the national anthem. Here\u2019s some images that have come into the Guardian picture desk of the scenes. German chancellor Angela Merkel has condemned the attempted military coup in Turkey and said Berlin stood by those who defended democracy and the rule of law in Turkey. \u201cIt\u2019s tragic that so many people died during this attempted coup,\u201d Merkel told reporters in Berlin. \u201cThe bloodshed in Turkey must stop now.\u201d Merkel said it was the right of the Turkish people to choose their political leader in free elections and political change should only be achieved within the framework of political institutions and the rules of democratic competition. \u201cTanks on the streets and air strikes against the own people are injustice,\u201d Merkel said. The Dialogue Society, a charity aimed at improving social cohesion, has issued a statement commenting on the coup, in which it claims its Turkish-speaking members in the UK have reported a spike in hate-crime since the coup erupted. It said: We hope those accused with trying to overthrow the government will be tried in courts of law and this incident becomes a source of motivation for strengthening Turkey\u2019s democracy. We are particularly concerned that Turkey\u2019s domestic troubles are used as a source of polarisation of the Turkish-speaking communities overseas and have already received reports from members of hate crime originating out of the UK. We encourage anyone who witnesses hate crime to report it to the police immediately. My US colleague Amana Fontanella-Khan is outside the Pennsylvania home of Fethullah Gulen, the Muslim cleric blamed by the Turkish president for the failed coup attempt. Here\u2019s a livestream of a rally in Istanbul celebrating the failure of the coup US Secretary of State John Kerry said the United States would entertain an extradition request for exiled cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Turkey\u2019s president blames for a failed coup, AP reports. But Kerry added Turkey\u2019s government would have to present evidence of Gulen\u2019s wrongdoing that withstands scrutiny. While visiting Luxembourg, Kerry said Turkey hasn\u2019t made a request to send the Pennsylvania-based Gulen home. But he says he anticipates questions about Gulen, who has condemned the coup. Turkey\u2019s state-run news agency says authorities have detained 10 members of Turkey\u2019s highest administrative court as the government appeared to press ahead with a purge of judiciary officials with alleged links to a US-based Muslim cleric. The Anadolu Agency said that arrest warrants were issued for 48 administrative court members and 140 members of Turkey\u2019s appeals court. Earlier, Anadolu said a body overseeing judges and prosecutors in Turkey has dismissed 2,745 judges across Turkey. John Kerry, US Secretary of State, has spoken at length to reporters about his administration\u2019s analysis of the failed coup in Turkey and the fallout. He said: The United States, without any hesitation, squarely and unequivocally stands for democratic leadership, for the respect for the democratically elected leader and for constitutional process with that regard. We stand by the Government of Turkey. It is our understanding that things are now calm, that order is being restored. I talked directly with my foreign minister counterpart, Mevlut Cavusoglu, last night at the time where things were still uncertain as to what was happening and expressed my confidence in him and in the Government and our readiness to be supportive. At this moment, all of our embassy personnel are 100% accounted for and okay. We are working to determine that all of our citizens who are travelling in Turkey are equally well taken care of and protected. There was obviously an unfortunate loss of life and so we extend our sympathies to all of the families of the victims, and our hope that in the immediate hours here things will remain calm. That there will be a constitutional process, and a legal process, that will deal appropriately with coup-plotters. But as of this moment, Turkey\u2019s co-operation with us with our coutner-terrorism efforts, in our Nato obligations and in our regional efforts with respect to Syria and Isis have not been affected negatively. All of that has continued as before. I\u2019m sure people will wonder about allegations of who may have instigated this and where support came from, the United States will obviously be supportive of any legitimate investigative efforts and under due process and within the law, we will be completely supportive of efforts to assist the Government if they so request. The Greek government says a Turkish Black Hawk helicopter will be returned to Turkey \u201cas soon as possible\u201d but it will examine the asylum demand made by eight military personnel who were arrested after landing, AP reports. Spokeswoman Olga Gerovasili said: \u201cThe government is in contact with the Turkish authorities for ... the return of the military helicopter as soon as possible.\u201d As for the eight military passengers, she said: \u201cWe will follow the procedures of international law. However, we give very serious considerations to the fact that [the Turkish military men] are accused, in their country, of violating the constitutional order and trying to overthrow democracy.\u201d Greek police said that the eight arrested Turks include two majors, four captains and two sergeants first class. This differs from Turkish sources that said they were two majors, a captain and five privates. Turkey\u2019s state-run Anadolu agency says all soldiers involved in the attempted coup at the military headquarters in the capital, Ankara, have been taken into custody. The report says anti-terrorism police will now conduct a detailed search at the headquarters. Greece\u2019s government spokeswoman, Olga Gerovasili, has announced the Athens government was in touch with its counterpart in Ankara over the landing of a Turkish military helicopter containing eight coup plotters in the northern border town of Alexandroupolis, Helena Smith reports. In the first official statement on the issue, Gerovasili said the military aircraft had been accompanied by two fighter jets into Greek airspace and would be returned to Turkey as soon as possible. Suggesting that crisis-hit Greece wanted nothing to do with the incident, she also suggested Greece would repatriate the eight military personnel aboard the helicopter. \u201cThe Greek government has been in touch with Turkish authorities in order to arrange the return as soon as possible of the military helicopter to Turkish authorities,\u201d she said. \u201cWith regards to the eight arrestees, procedures foreseen by international law will be upheld although it is seriously being taken into account that in their country the arrested stand accused of violating constitutional law and attempting the overthrow of democracy.\u201d Turkish authorities have removed 2,745 judges from duty following the coup attempt, broadcaster NTV reported, citing a decision by the High Council of Judges and Prosectors (HSYK). Five members of HSYK, Turkey\u2019s highest judiciary board, were also removed, state-run Anadolu agency reported. US-based cleric Fethullah G\u00fclen, who was blamed by President Erdogan for leading the attempted coup, has denied any involvement in the uprising, according to reports. Reuters have released a statement from G\u00fclen that said he \u201ccategorically denies\u201d the claims that he orchestrated the coup, and argued power should be won through free and fair elections. He also reportedly said Erdogan\u2019s accusations were \u201cespecially insulting\u201d as he suffered at the hands of multiple military coups in Turkey. \u201cI condemn, in the strongest terms, the attempted military coup in Turkey \u2026 Government should be won through a process of free and fair elections, not force,\u201d the statement said. \u201cI pray to God for Turkey, for Turkish citizens and for all those currently in Turkey that this situation is resolved peacefully and quickly \u2026 As someone who suffered under multiple military coups during the past five decades, it is especially insulting to be accused of having any link to such an attempt. I categorically deny such accusations.\u201d Leaders of Turkey\u2019s religious communities have released a joint statement condemning the attempted coup. The statement from representatives of the Jewish, Christian and Muslim communities declares \u201cour great sorrow over the terrorist attacks that disturb the peace of our great nation and of the world\u201d. The signatories include the president of Turkey\u2019s directorate of religious affairs, Istanbul Greek Orthodox patriarch Bartholomeos and the chief rabbi of Turkey\u2019s Jewish community. Here\u2019s a summary of events in Turkey overnight and into Saturday: An attempted military coup was launched in Turkey on Friday in a bid to oust the president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, accusing him of undermining the country\u2019s secular traditions, but was brought under control overnight by loyalist forces. At least 194 people died in the coup, including 41 police officers, two soldiers, 47 civilians and 104 people described as \u201ccoup plotters\u201d. Erdo\u011fan, who returned to Istanbul in the early hours of the morning from his holiday in the resort of Marmaris, said the attempted coup was \u201ctreason\u201d undertaken by \u201ca minority within our armed forces\u201d. The prime minister, Binali Yildirim, said on Saturday that legal changes would be considered to reintroduce the death penalty to deal with coup-plotters. He called the plot \u201ca black stain\u201d on Turkish democracy. There have been mass-surrenders in Istanbul, with about 50 soldiers on Bosphorus Bridge in Istanbul abandoning their tanks with their hands raised. The head of the armed forces, General Hulusi Akar, who was reportedly taken hostage, has been freed. Two Turkish majors, a captain and five privates have requested asylum in Greece after landing in a military helicopter. Greece\u2019s defense ministry has said a Blackhawk helicopter carrying seven Turkish military personnel and one civilian landed in the city of Alexandroupolis earlier on Saturday. The passengers asked for asylum and were arrested for illegal entry into Greece. The UK foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, has said he remains very concerned about the situation in Turkey after an attempted military coup left 161 people dead. Johnson said officials were working hard to \u201cdo the best\u201d for the many Britons in Turkey and urged them to follow the Foreign Office\u2019s updated travel advice which continues to \u201cstrongly advise\u201d holidaymakers and others to stay indoors. British Airways cancelled all flights to and from Turkey on Saturday. The Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) says about 50,000 holidaymakers are in Greece with its members. Here\u2019s a round-up of global reaction to the failed coup in Turkey: Britain The foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, said he had spoken to his Turkish counterpart, Mevlut Cavusoglu, to underline support for Turkey\u2019s \u201cdemocratic elected government and institutions\u201d in the wake of the overnight coup attempt. The Foreign Office is advising Britons in Turkey to stay indoors, avoid public places \u2013 especially demonstrations \u2013 and remain vigilant. It says: \u201cThe situation now appears quieter in Istanbul, and the bridges across the Bosphorus are reopening. But there are reports of tank fire and small arms fire in Ankara.\u201d British Airways says it is canceling all flights to and from Turkey on Saturday, but easyJet says it plans to runs its scheduled flights, largely to Turkish resort towns. The budget airline says the schedule \u201cwill be kept under continuous review\u201d. Nato Nato\u2019s chief says all alliance personnel and military units in Turkey are \u201csafe and secure\u201d following the attempted coup. Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said in a Twitter post that he had spoken to Nato\u2019s supreme commander, US Army Gen Curtis M Scapparrotti, who \u201cconfirms that all Nato personnel and units in Turkey are safe and secure\u201d. The alliance chief also tweeted that he welcomed \u201cthe strong support shown by the people and all political parties to democracy and to the democratically elected government of Turkey\u201d. Spain Spain\u2019s acting foreign minister, Jose Manuel Garcia Margallo, condemned the attempted coup, telling Spanish national television that his government completely supports the Turkish government headed by President Erdogan. He said: \u201cWithout a doubt we support respecting the constitution and democratically elected institutions, and we condemn all coups without reservation.\u201d Garcia Margallo spoke by telephone from Mongolia, where he is attending the ASEM Asia-Europe Meeting. Syrian opposition The exiled Syrian opposition congratulated the Turkish people for halting the attempted military coup. The Turkey-based Syrian National Coalition said Turkey has protected its democratic institutions \u201cin the face of dark and desperate attempts that sought to take control of the popular will\u201d. It says the Turkish people value democracy and \u201cwill not let a group of putschists take it away in a desperate attempt to restore military rule\u201d. Turkey has been one of the main backers of the uprising against the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, and is hosting 2.7 million Syrian refugees. In the early hours of the attempted coup, celebratory gunfire broke out across Damascus. The government and its supporters view the rebels as terrorists and consider Turkey to be one of their chief sponsors. Hamas The Islamic militant group Hamas has congratulated Erdogan for quashing a \u201cvicious\u201d plot to overthrow him. The Turkish leader has been a staunch supporter of Hamas and a fierce critic of Israel. Hamas says it remembers Turkey\u2019s \u201cwise leadership in supporting the Palestinian people and their cause\u201d and working to lift the blockade on Gaza, the coastal territory ruled by the group. Hamas supporters took to the streets in several places across the Gaza Strip to celebrate the failure of the coup, raising Turkish flags and posters bearing Erdogan\u2019s image. Turkey recently restored ties with Israel after a six-year lull following a deadly Israeli naval raid to stop an activist flotilla aiming to breach the Gaza blockade. Qatar The Gulf nation of Qatar, which has close ties to Erdogan\u2019s government, was quick to condemn the military coup attempt. It called the attempted coup a \u201cviolation of the constitutional legitimacy\u201d in Turkey and said it supports all legal measures the government takes to maintain security and stability. The official Qatar News Agency said the ruling emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, has spoken with Erdogan by phone to express Qatar\u2019s support. Qatar and Turkey have grown increasingly close in recent years, and share similar stances on their support for Syrian rebel groups and the Muslim Brotherhood. The two countries agreed last year to establish a Turkish military base in Qatar. Iran Iran said the attempted military coup in Turkey was \u201cdoomed to fail\u201d. The foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, was quoted by the official IRNA news agency as praising the \u201cbrave defence by the people of Turkey of their democracy and elected government\u201d. He said the events in neighbouring Turkey prove \u201cthat coup d\u2019\u00e9tat has no place and is doomed to fail in our region\u201d. Pakistan An aide to prime minister Nawaz Sharif condemned the attempted coup in a statement and said Pakistan \u201chopes that peace and normalcy will be restored in Turkey\u201d. Tariq Fatimi also said he had contacted Turkey\u2019s foreign minister to express solidarity with Turkey\u2019s government and democratic institutions. Pakistan\u2019s main political parties have also praised the people of Turkey for foiling the coup. Sharif was himself overthrown in a 1999 coup led by Gen. Pervez Musharraf, who ruled Pakistan until 2008. Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani expressed support for Turkey\u2019s elected government, saying in a statement that \u201cdemocratic elections are the most effective means for peaceful transfer of power\u201d. \u201cMilitaristic options will only undermine democratic institutions, stability and development in the country,\u201d the statement from Ghani\u2019s office said. Azerbaijan The president of Turkey\u2019s neighbor Azerbaijan condemned the attempted coup. President Ilham Aliev was concerned about developments in Turkey and \u201cwelcomed measures taken to prevent the attempt at a coup and to stabilise the situation,\u201d spokesman Ali Hasanov said. Azerbaijan is a Turkic nation and its late president Geidar Aliev once described their relations as \u201cone nation, two states\u201d \u2013 a phrase later echoed by TErdogan. In Greece, our correspondent Helena Smith is being told that the eight Turkish military personnel who sought asylum in the northern Greek town of Alexandoupolis have removed all insignia from their uniforms, making it impossible to know their ranks. She reports: \u201cWe are in the process of sending interpreters in order to be debriefed,\u201d one insider said. \u201cWe are also in touch with the Turkish embassy. It is vital that we know what is going on.\u201d Another said it was highly unlikely that the eight men would be granted asylum. Turkey and Greece, though Nato partners, are long-time adversaries, with Athens closely watching events in Ankara. As such, a defence expert said, this was the first time a Turkish military asset had landed in Greece with a view to seeking asylum in the country. The land borders between the neighbours have been reinforced but customs officials are clarifying that while the crossing between Greece and Turkey remains open (even if cross-border traffic has been reduced to a trickle), that between Turkey and Greece remains firmly closed. The Turkish president, Tayyip Erdogan, has sent a mass text message to Turkish mobile phones imploring Turks to \u201cstand up\u201d for democracy and peace. The message, which came from \u201cRT ERDOGAN\u201d and was signed with his full name, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, also called on people to take to the streets against a \u201cnarrow cadre\u201d. The Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) says there are currently 50,000 people on holiday with its members. A statement from the organisation said: Following reports of an attempted military coup in Turkey, the situation remains fluid. Abta recommends that members of the public read and follow the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office (FCO) advice and any advice or instructions issued by their travel provider or airline. There has been no change to FCO advice regarding travel to Turkey and holiday programmes to the resort areas continue to operate. The vast majority of British travellers to Turkey will fly directly to the beach resorts on Turkey\u2019s south coast which are hundred of miles away from Istanbul and the capital, Ankara. Abta estimates there are currently 50,000 people on holiday with its members in Turkey. There is no indication that guests in the coastal resorts are affected. Reuters is reporting that an anti-government group has taken over a frigate and taken the head of the Turkish fleet hostage at Turkey\u2019s Golcuk naval base. The Turkish foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, has demanded the return of eight military personnel who have landed in Greece seeking political asylum after the failed coup. British Airways has put out this statement: In the light of events in Turkey we have cancelled all flights to and from Turkey on Saturday 16 July 2016, and BA675 departing from Istanbul on Sunday 17 July. We are keeping flights to Turkey under review. The safety and security of our customers and crew are always our top priority and we would never operate a flight unless it was safe to do so. Turkish maritime authorities have shut Istanbul\u2019s Bosphorus Strait to transiting tankers \u201cfor security and safety\u201d reasons, Reuters reports. The shipping agent GAC said some cargo carriers, such as bulkers, were still being allowed to travel through the Bosphorus which divides Istanbul into European and Asian sides. The Bosphorus is one of world\u2019s most important choke-points for the maritime transit of oil, with more than 3% of global supply \u2013 mainly from Russia and the Caspian Sea \u2013 passing through the 17-mile waterway that connects the Black Sea to the Mediterranean. It also ships vast amounts of grains from Russia and Kazakhstan to world markets. Greece has arrested eight men from a Turkish military helicopter which landed in the northern city of Alexandroupolis at midday on Saturday, the country\u2019s police ministry said. The men have requested political asylum, it added. Greek state television ERT said the men may have been involved in Turkey\u2019s military uprising on Friday. Georgia has shut its border with Turkey after the coup attempt, Associated Press reports. The prime minister, Giorgi Kvirikashvili, said Georgia\u2019s security council on Saturday discussed \u201cthreats that might arise\u201d from the situation and that land and air borders had been closed. The former Soviet republic shares a 150-mile (250km) border with Turkey. The British Labour MP and shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, said: We welcome the fact that democratic rule is prevailing in Turkey, and applaud the Turkish people \u2013 including many opposed to the current government \u2013 who bravely united to stand up for democracy. We mourn all those who have been killed and injured in the last 24 hours, and we urge everyone in Turkey, on all sides, to end the bloodshed and ensure there is no recrimination. We urge the Turkish government now to recognise the need to unify the country and show greater respect for human rights, free speech and justice. These events cannot be used as justification for yet further repression and division. Federica Mogherini, the vice-president of the European commission, convened an urgent meeting of EU member states\u2019 foreign ministers and representatives, who are currently at a summit in Mongolia, to assess the situation in Turkey. According to a statement, they expressed support for the democratic institutions of Turkey and condemned the use of violence against them. It said: \u201cThey agreed that any escalation of violence involving civilians has to be avoided. \u201cThe ministers will meet again in Brussels for the Foreign Affairs Council, and will discuss again the situation in Turkey at that occasion.\u201d Mogherini spoke to the Turkish foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, and has been in contact with other foreign ministers and the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg. Asked if reintroducing the death penalty was an option for dealing with coup plotters, Yildirim said the death penalty was not in the constitution but legal changes would be considered. Turkish authorities have issued an alert to borders and airports after being told that prominent members of the Gulen Movement, including journalists, might flee the country after the attempted coup, according to the state-run press agency Anadolu. The report says authorities discovered the plans after lists were found detailing the commanders and their deputies to be put in charge during the period of martial law if the coup had succeeded. Turkey\u2019s acting chief of the general staff, Gen Umit Dundar, said on Saturday that the military was determined to purge members of the movement of Fethullah Gulen, a Muslim cleric living in exile in Pennsylvania, from its ranks. Countries are lining up to condemn the coup attempt, Associated Press reports. Spain\u2019s acting foreign minister, Jose Manuel Garcia Margallo, tells Spanish national television that his government completely supports the Turkish government, saying \u201cwe condemn all coups without reservation\u201d. And the Gulf nation of Qatar, which has close ties to Erdogan\u2019s government, said it supports all legal measures Turkey\u2019s government takes to maintain security and stability. The official Qatar news agency reported on Saturday that the ruling emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, had spoken with Erdogan by phone to express Qatar\u2019s support. I\u2019ll post a summary of Yildirim\u2019s press conference shortly. The first stage of the coup is over, Yildirim says. The Turkish prime minister called on Turkish citizens to fill town and city squares with national flags tonight. Yildirim says 2,839 members of the army have been detained, ranging from ordinary soldiers to high-ranking officers. The Turkish president and the Turkish people have together overcome the uprising, the Turkish PM says. Those who opened fire on Turkish citizens are \u2018worse than\u2019 the Kurdish PKK, Yildirim says. The coup-plotters should know that no one can \u201cplay games\u201d with the stability of Turkey and the love of freedom and democracy its civilians have, the Turkish PM says. The nation will never forget these people who committed treason, Yildirim says. He thanks those who stood up against the tanks and risked their lives for their country\u2019s independence. Yildirim says the police and security forces risked their lives to restore order. Turkish law will now deal with coup-plotters, they will be punished accordingly, Yildirim says. The Turkish prime minister, Binali Yildirim, is addressing the media in Ankara. He says the coup attempt was a \u201cblack stain\u201d on Turkish democracy. Yildirim calls the coup plotters terrorists, but says the nation has answered their attempt effectively. Turkey\u2019s government has the coup situation \u201c90% under control\u201d, although some military commanders are still being held hostage by the plotters, the EU minister, Omer Celik, has said. Celik\u2019s comments were broadcast live on the private channel NTV. Turkish Airlines has said its operations at Istanbul Ataturk airport have returned to normal and flights are resuming, according to the Press Association. Turkey\u2019s state run press agency Anadolu is reporting that soldiers who have taken over the Chief of General Staff Headquarters as part of an attempted coup have requested negotiations to surrender. According to a Turkish official at the presidency, that is the last base the coup supporters hold. The UK\u2019s recently-appointed foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, has been speaking to Sky News. He said: We\u2019ve been following the developments in Turkey and we\u2019re concerned about what\u2019s been going on there. First we want to urge calm and the avoidance of any further bloodshed. It\u2019s crucial we respect the democratic institutions of Turkey. That\u2019s a message that was very much echoed by the Turkish foreign minister, my counterpart, Mevlut Cavusoglu, to whom I spoke a couple of hours ago. He was very grateful for UK support at the UN and elsewhere. Obviously I\u2019ve spoken to our diplomatic staff in Ankara and in Istanbul. They\u2019re doing a fantastic job. They\u2019re working very hard, as you can imagine, to do the best for the many Brits who are there, the many people who are there on holiday. They should follow the travel advice and we\u2019ll do our best to update you as soon as we can. Airspace over Turkey\u2019s northwest Marmara region has been closed to civilian flights, which will resume at 6.05pm GMT, according to the Anadolu, the Turkish state-run press agency. The Russian foreign ministry has released a statement warning that the coup poses an \u201cincreased danger\u201d to international and regional stability. It said: The aggravating political situation (in Turkey) against the backdrop of existing terrorist threats in this country and an armed conflict in the region pose increased danger to international and regional stability. Forces loyal to the Turkish government fought on Saturday to crush the remnants of a military coup attempt which crumbled after crowds answered President Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s call to take to the streets and dozens of rebels abandoned their tanks. Former British Army chief of general staff Lord Dannatt says it is important that Britain is able to work with Turkey \u201creliably and dependably\u201d given its role fighting Islamic State in neighbouring Syria and Iraq. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: Of course Turkey is an important Nato ally, where Turkey sits vis-a-vis the fight against Isil\u2019s so-called Islamic State is absolutely critical. Yes of course it\u2019s got its own internal divisions and difficulties vis-a-vis the Kurdish aspect of that conflict but it\u2019s really important that we can work reliably and dependably with Turkey because Turkey is an important part in this fight, really critical fight, to defeat Islamic State. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the death toll in the Turkish coup, as provided by General Umit Dundar, the newly appointed acting chief of the general staff. More than 190 people dead: 41 police officers, Two soldiers 47 civilians 104 people described as \u201ccoup plotters.\u201d Piero Castellano is a photojournalist based in Ankara. He told the BBC that after President Erdogan appeared on TV, Turks surged onto the streets. People rushed to the main square, to rush to the tanks and the armoured carriers - it was a bloodbath. It was unexpected. There is a very strong link, or maybe there was until last night, there was a very strong link between the Turkish people and their military. So people were shocked when the military actually fired on the crowd. Labour\u2019s election co-ordinator Jon Trickett, an ally of Jeremy Corbyn, has faced criticism for making a joke on Twitter, in which he likened the Turkish coup to the leadership challenge within the Labour party. As the Huffington Post\u2019s Paul Waugh predicted, Trickett did later delete the tweet and apologised. Acting chairman of the joint chiefs of staff Umit Dundar, the loyalist who was appointed overnight following the alleged kidnapping of his precedessor by coup forces, has given a speech in Turkey claiming that the coup has failed. In a reference to Turkey\u2019s four previous coups in recent decades, Dundar promised that the army had \u201cirreversibly closed the chapter of military coups.\u201d He said: \u201cThe people have taken to the streets and voiced their support for democracy. Turkey displayed a historic cooperation between the government and the people. The nation will never forget this betrayal. Turkey has irreversibly closed the chapter of military coups.\u201d He added: \u201cThe armed forces is determined to remove members of the Gulen movement from its ranks. We will continue to serve the people. I would like to thank all political parties and the media for their support for democracy. Those who betrayed their country will not go unpunished.\u201d Umit Dundar, who has been appointed acting chief of military staff, has said 104 coup plotters have been killed, according to Reuters. Dundar said the coup plotter death toll is on top of the 90 people declared as dead, including 47 civilians. A further 1154 people have been wounded. As we\u2019ve heard, coup plotters attempted to take over the state news channel TRT and was able to read a statement on air. Carlos van Meek, director of news at state news channel TRT, described the moment he was stopped from broadcasting by coup plotters. He told the BBC: We were taken off air in our headquarters in Ankara and at our secondary location in Istanbul. I run the English language service. Our teams there were forced to leave the building, they cut the cord and took us off air. At least for the group in Istanbul, I can speak to the group specifically, there phones were confiscated as well so we can\u2019t get in touch with many of our staff, our Outlook is down, so it has been quite complicated just talking to the folks who were in the newsroom at the time. It has been a scary night for my staff and people who work at the other channels of TRT but fortunately no one was hurt and everyone is safe at home from what I understand. Footage of the Turkish Army chief, General Hulusi Akar, being rescued has been posted on the Twitter account belonging to Turkish PM Binali Yildirim. The Turkish Embassy in London has released a statement. The situation unfolded in Turkey was a coup attempt to overthrow the democratically-elected government. This attempt was foiled by the Turkish people in unity and solidarity. Our president and government are in charge. Turkish armed forces was not involved in the coup attempt in its entirety. It was conducted by a clique within the armed forces and received a well-deserved response from our nation. The UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has warned that flights to Turkey are being diverted or cancelled. Eyewitness accounts to the dramatic, and confusing, events in Turkey overnight are filtering through. British-Turkish writer Alev Scott, 29, who lives about 200 metres from the square, spoke to the Press Association about her night. I went through Taksim Square and there were soldiers and police. It was fairly quiet - a bit of shouting. There aren\u2019t normally lots of soldiers, just some police, but recently there have been some soldiers there and I wonder if that was connected. When I got home I heard there was shooting in Taksim Square and I started hearing the gunfire and the call to prayer - but it wasn\u2019t the call to prayer - it was completely the wrong time of night. I don\u2019t know whether they were calling people to the streets - it could be. So then I was watching things from my terrace, watching the military vehicles on the Bosphorus Bridge and then these sonic booms started. It was actually quite scary so I went down into my flat just keeping away from the windows which had all blown open. Here\u2019s some video of Turkish police attempting to arrest soldiers involved in the coup before being overrun by civilians. WARNING: some viewers may find the images distressing. Hello, Jamie Grierson here. The UK\u2019s new foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, has confirmed on Twitter that he has spoken to Turkey\u2019s foreign minister. I\u2019m now handing over the live blog to my colleague Jamie Grierson in London, who\u2019ll continue to bring you the latest developments, including an expected statement from prime minister Binali Yildirim at around 11am local time. The latest summary of events is here: Istanbul is returning to some degree of normality. I just took a couple of taxis and a ferry, and people are up and about. On the Bosphorus bridge, where we saw the first sign of a coup in Istanbul, after soldiers closed it late last night, there are jubilant Erdo\u011fan supporters celebrating their perceived victory. Many wave Turkish flags \u2013 some of them from the tops of abandoned military vehicles that were left behind after the coup plotters beat a swift retreat this morning. One of the final outposts of the putschists seems to be at the armed forces headquarters in Ankara, where pro-government forces are still trying to secure the site. Some in Turkey are saying they\u2019ve received SMS messages on Saturday morning from authorities encouraging them to gather in the streets again today in support of democracy. Many of those protesting say they do not support the government or Erdo\u011fan but will demonstrate in support of the democratically elected government in the face of an attempted \u2013 if apparently failed \u2013 military coup. President Erdo\u011fan \u2013 or at least the elected government \u2013 has received backing too from China and Japan today. In China, state television cited the foreign ministry in Beijing calling on Turkey to restore order and stability as soon as possible. In Japan, prime minister Shinzo Abe said Turkey\u2019s democracy must be respected, and that peace and order should be swiftly restored. The state news agency, Anadolu, says the death toll has risen to 90. A further 1,154 people have been wounded, it reports. MPs are currently holding an extraordinary meeting, called by prime minister Binali Yildirim, to discuss the attempted coup. The meeting is taking place in the parliament building targeted overnight by soldiers involved in the coup, and which suffered damage from several explosions: The number of military personnel arrested after the attempted coup now stands at 1,563. Insisting he remains firmly in control, President Erdo\u011fan made clear in his various statements that the attempted coup would provide an opportunity to \u201cclean out\u201d the armed forces. He compared those behind the coup to \u201cterrorist groups\u201d. Here are some of his key quotes: What is being perpetrated is a treason and a rebellion. They will pay a heavy price for this act of treason. We will not leave our country to occupiers. Those who stain the military\u2019s reputation must leave. The process has started today, and it will continue just as we fight other terrorist groups. They have pointed the people\u2019s guns against the people. The president, whom 52% of the people brought to power, is in charge. This government brought to power by the people is in charge. They won\u2019t succeed as long as we stand against them by risking everything. The picture from Turkey is clearer on Saturday morning, with president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan insisting he remains in charge after a night in which a military faction attempted to overthrow the government. But pockets of fighting continue, with some of those behind the coup claiming to be fighting on. Here is what we know: The attempted coup An attempted military coup has apparently been defeated in Turkey, in a bid to oust the president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, accusing him of undermining the country\u2019s secular traditions. Erdo\u011fan, who returned to Istanbul in the early hours of the morning from his holiday in the resort of Marmaris, said the attempted coup was \u201ctreason\u201d undertaken by \u201ca minority within our armed forces\u201d. The president urged people to take to the streets in defence of the government, prompting chaotic scenes as thousands protested alongside tanks. Prime minister Binali Yildirim said coup fighters using military helicopters would be shot down. There were mass surrenders in Istanbul, with around 50 soldiers on Bosphorus Bridge in Istanbul abandoning their tanks with their hands raised. The head of the armed forces, General Hulusi Akar, who was reportedly taken hostage, has been freed. But a pro-coup military faction insisted it would continue its fight and there were reports of ongoing clashes in Ankara, where a building in the parliamentary complex was bombed overnight. Deaths and arrests At least 60 people have been killed, many of them civilians. Sixteen people involved in the attempted coup were killed in clashes at military police command, and 250 others arrested. Separately, 13 soldiers who tried to storm the presidential palace in Ankara have been arrested. In total, 1,563 members of the armed forces have been arrested, among them 29 colonels and five generals. Rear Admiral Nejat Atilla Demirhan and General Memduh Hakbilen, the chief of staff of Turkey\u2019s command for the Aegean region, are said to be among those detained. Erdo\u011fan\u2019s response In a defiant address to supporters at Istanbu\u2019s Ataturk airport, Erdo\u011fan said the armed forces needed to understand that they were not in charge of the state, saying the coup plotters had brought out tanks, but \u201cmy people\u201d had taken them back. In an earlier statement, the president said the failed coup represented an opportunity to \u201cclean out\u201d the armed forces. He also accused \u201cthose in Pennsylvania\u201d \u2013 that is, cleric Fethullah G\u00fclen and his supporters \u2013 of betraying the nation and orchestrating the coup. G\u00fclen denies involvement Fethullah G\u00fclen has rejected the claim that he was behind the coup: I condemn, in the strongest terms, the attempted military coup in Turkey. Government should be won through a process of free and fair elections, not force. As someone who suffered under multiple military coups during the past five decades, it is especially insulting to be accused of having any link to such an attempt. I categorically deny such accusations. International reaction US president Barack Obama urged all parties to back the \u201cdemocratically elected\u201d government. Officials of the EU \u2013 Donald Tusk, Jean-Claude Juncker and Federica Mogherini \u2013 issued a statement supporting the Turkish government: Turkey is a key partner for the European Union. The EU fully supports the democratically elected government, the institutions of the country and the rule of law. Steffen Seibert, spokesman for German chancellor Angela Merkel, said on Saturday morning: The democratic order in Turkey must be respected. Everything needs to be done to protect human lives. The UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon said: Military interference in the affairs of any state is unacceptable. US Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said: We should all urge calm and respect for laws, institutions, and basic human rights and freedoms \u2013 and support for the democratically elected civilian government. The new British foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, tweeted: Turkey on Saturday Yildirim has called an emergency meeting in parliament on Saturday. Flights were diverted from Istanbul\u2019s Ataturk airport and departures cancelled after reports of explosions there, but are now resuming. Turkey has closed border crossings to Bulgaria, which said it was beefing up its own border controls. Media outlets including CNN Turk that were shut down by soldiers during the attempted coup are returning to the air. Authorities in Turkey may be blocking or slowing access to social media networks including Twitter and Facebook. Turkey has a long history of coups: the most recent occurring in 1997, and one of the most brutal in 1980. President Erdo\u011fan\u2019s Islamist-leaning government was believed to be in a stronger position than most previous civilian administrations, shoring up his position during a decade of economic success. He also inserted sympathisers and loyalists into key parts of the state apparatus and increasingly cracked down on suspected plotters. But recent events in Turkey and across the Middle East have destabilised the country, with Kurdish rebels fighting a new insurgency in the south-east of the country. The Syrian civil war, raging across Turkey\u2019s southern border, has also spilt over into Turkey, with Islamic State mounting a series of terror attacks across Turkey in the past year, killing hundreds. Erdo\u011fan\u2019s Islamist-aligned government was also perceived by liberal wings of Turkish society to be infringing on the secular traditions established by the father of the modern Turkish state, Kemal Atat\u00fcrk. But it is also opposed by followers of Fethullah G\u00fclen, the exiled leader of another Islamist-minded movement. Reports from Turkey say the head of the armed forces, General Hulusi Akar, who was apparently taken hostage during the attempted coup, has been freed. That would appear to signal the end of Umit D\u00fcndar\u2019s role as acting chief of military staff, which has lasted about two hours. Sixteen people involved in the attempted coup have been killed in clashes at Turkey\u2019s military police command, says police chief Celalettin Lekesiz, according to state news agency Anadolu. Two hundred and fifty others have been arrested, Lekesiz says, adding that fighting at the compound continues but the skirmishes \u201care about to come to an end\u201d. Anadolu also reports that General Memduh Hakbilen, the chief of staff of Turkey\u2019s command for the Aegean region, is among those arrested. In total, 754 members of the armed forces have been arrested. Anadolu reported that soldiers involved in the coup were detained by fellow officers at the Etimesgut armoured units training command, close to Ankara, and handed over to police. Reports from Turkey say 29 colonels and five generals have been removed from their military posts. A total of 754 members of the armed forces have been detained following the attempted coup. A group of rebels continue to fight and are believed to still have control of some military helicopters. There were attacks overnight on the Turkish parliament and presidential palace; it is unclear whether those assaults have stopped. Images from Ankara on Saturday morning show some of the damage. Turkish news site Aksam reports the arrest of Rear Admiral Nejat Atilla Demirhan: According to a senior government official, via Reuters, Turkish military headquarters are now back under the control of armed forces loyal to the government. However, there are still pockets of rebel soldiers continuing to fight, and they still have some military helicopters. No fighter jets remain under rebel control, the official said. Germany has expressed its backing for the Turkish government against the attempted coup. Steffen Seibert, spokesman for German chancellor Angela Merkel, said on Saturday morning: The democratic order in Turkey must be respected. Everything needs to be done to protect human lives. State news agency Anadolu now reports that 754 members of the armed forces have been detained in connection with the attempted coup. Fethullah G\u00fclen, the US-based cleric accused by Erdo\u011fan of directing the coup from his home in Pennsylvania, has rejected the claim. In a statement, G\u00fclen said: I condemn, in the strongest terms, the attempted military coup in Turkey. Government should be won through a process of free and fair elections, not force. As someone who suffered under multiple military coups during the past five decades, it is especially insulting to be accused of having any link to such an attempt. I categorically deny such accusations. Read more about G\u00fclen and his rivalry with Erdo\u011fan here: In the face of government assertions that the coup has failed, the pro-coup faction of the armed forces insists it is still fighting, Reuters reports: An email from the Turkish military general staff\u2019s press office address said on Saturday the faction of officers behind an attempted military coup overnight was still determinedly fighting all those who try to oppose it. Calling itself the Peace at Home Movement, the faction also called on people to stay indoors for their own safety. The Guardian\u2019s Patrick Kingsley is in Istanbul and sends this latest: Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, appeared to have weathered the worst of an attempted coup after a night of chaos and bloodshed that saw an army faction try to oust a civilian government in Turkey for the fifth time in 60 years. As the sun rose over Turkey on Saturday, confrontations were continuing in some parts of the country. But Erdo\u011fan had been able to re-emerge from a retreat on the coast of the Aegean Sea and fly to Istanbul, where he was greeted by crowds of his supporters who overran the airport, having defied troops who had tried to seal it off. \u201cTurkey has a democratically elected government and president,\u201d Erdo\u011fan said after landing. \u201cWe are in charge and we will continue exercising our powers until the end. We will not abandon our country to these invaders. It will end well.\u201d Huge crowds of Turks defied a military curfew, gathering to oppose the coup by swarming around military vehicles and in some cases lying down in front of them. A series of opposition leaders, normally critical of Erdo\u011fan\u2019s increasingly autocratic ways, also issued supportive statements. A leading pro-Kurdish party, the People\u2019s Democratic party (HDP), said: \u201cThe only solution is democratic politics.\u201d The prime minister, Binyali Yildirim, said at least 336 rebel officers had been captured by loyalist forces and promised to shoot down any military planes in the control of the coup\u2019s supporters. Footage also emerged of police officers arresting soldiers who had taken over Istanbul\u2019s central square on Friday night and rounding up army officials who initially seized a television channel. Istanbul\u2019s two airports, shut on Friday night by the coup\u2019s supporters, reopened at 6am, and a bridge spanning the city\u2019s Asian and European sides followed suit less than an hour later. But Erdo\u011fan\u2019s loyalists could not quite declare victory, with gunfire heard in parts of Istanbul and at least one fighter jet \u2013 believed to be controlled by rebel pilots \u2013 making menacing low-flying swoops over the city centre. At least 60 people died in overnight fighting, the presidency said, after the coup leaders launched a series of attacks on the parliament in Ankara and fired tank missiles at pro-government protesters in the streets outside. Gruesome footage showed corpses with limbs and torsos blown apart by tank ordnance, and the sun rose on Saturday to reveal charred walls and smashed windows of the parliament. Updated figures now say at least 60 people died in the attempted coup overnight. Some 336 people thought to have been involved in the plot have been arrested, according to the justice minister. Umit D\u00fcndar is the new acting chief of military staff, says prime minister Binali Yildirim. There is no word on the current head of the armed forces, General Hulusi Akar. Earlier, Erdo\u011fan said he had no information about Akar, who was reportedly taken hostage at military headquarters by those behind the attempted coup. Reuters has more details as soldiers involved in the coup begin to surrender in Istanbul: Around 50 soldiers involved in an attempted military coup in Turkey surrendered on one of the bridges across the Bosphorus in Istanbul on Saturday, abandoning their tanks with their hands raised in the air, live footage on CNN Turk showed. A Reuters witness earlier saw tens of other pro-coup soldiers surrendering to armed police after being surrounded in Istanbul\u2019s central Taksim square. Broadcasters are now showing live images of soldiers on Bosphorus Bridge in Istanbul leaving their tanks with their hands raised. Turkish government officials say the coup is now over \u2013 although Erdo\u011fan did concede that what he called a \u201csmall disturbance\u201d continues in Ankara. Reports from the capital, however, say fighting is still going on, with the state-run Anadolu news agency saying a military helicopter used by coup plotters has been shot down on the outskirts of Ankara. Government sources say Turkish F-16s have also launched air strikes against tanks outside the presidential palace. The crowd, numbering in the thousands, is chanting and singing \u2013 one nation, one flag, one motherland \u2013 and shouting Erdo\u011fan\u2019s name as he leaves the platform. Erdo\u011fan says he will stand firm and will not compromise. He says he will address \u201cthose in Pennsylvania\u201d \u2013 by which he means cleric Fethullah G\u00fclen and his supporters \u2013 accusing them of betraying the nation. That\u2019s enough, he says: if you are courageous, come back to Turkey. Broadcasts from Turkey show President Erdo\u011fan addressing a sizeable crowd in Istanbul now. He tells supporters that the government will succeed. From the highest level of the army to lowest-ranking officers, he says, the armed forces must know they cannot govern the state. The government is elected and is in control, he says. The people elected a president and that president is here. He says the coup plotters brought out tanks, but \u201cmy people\u201d took them back. Istanbul\u2019s Ataturk airport \u2013 where more than 40 people were killed in suicide attacks just a fortnight ago \u2013 is now reportedly back in the hands of officers loyal to the government having earlier on Friday night been targeted by coup backers. Flights were suspended or diverted, but some are now arriving. A number of flights are being diverted to Istanbul\u2019s second airport, Sabiha, as the situation at Ataturk remains unclear. Turkish Airlines said it encouraged citizens to \u201cstand up against this attack on our parliament and our public representatives\u201d: Broadcaster CNN-Turk is back on air, having been closed down on Friday night when soldiers entered the building and ordered journalists to leave. State broadcaster TRT was also taken off air by those involved in the coup; Carlos Van Meek, its news director, told CNN in the US that its English-language channel remained off the air. Some of its Turkish channels might be restoring signals, Van Meek said: By taking us off the air, they felt they had the opportunity to control the message. However, Reuters reports that bomb attacks on the parliament are continuing, with a senior Turkish official saying rebel soldiers have been warned they will be shot down if they attempt to use more military aircraft. The Turkish prime minister Binali Yildirim has called an emergency meeting in parliament on Saturday, the state-run Anadolu news agency reports. The parliament complex was bombed overnight, but parliament speaker Ismail Kahraman said no legislators were hurt. There were reports that some police officers were injured or killed but this has not been confirmed. The accusations by Turkey\u2019s president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan that US-based cleric Fethullah G\u00fclen is behind last night\u2019s attempted coup is part of a familiar rhetoric and a long-running rivalry. So Is there any truth in it? The traditional rivalry in Turkish society has been between secularists who look to the modern state\u2019s founder Kemal Ataturk \u2013 notably the army and other state institutions \u2013 and Islamists. So who are the G\u00fclenists? G\u00fclen, a cleric living in exile in Pennsylvania, leads a popular movement \u2013 Hizmet or \u201cthe service\u201d \u2013 ostensibly campaigning for democratic accountability. The centre of recent tension between the G\u00fclenists and Erdo\u011fan and his AKP is the president\u2019s decision to blame G\u00fclenists in the police and judiciary for initiating anti-corruption allegations in 2013 that targeted his supporters, including Erdo\u011fan\u2019s son Bilal. Erdo\u011fan responded by launching a purge of perceived G\u00fclenists. As the coup attempt unfolded on Friday night, a lawyer for the Turkish government, Robert Amsterdam, said \u201cthere are indications of direct involvement\u201d of G\u00fclenists. According to Turkish intelligence sources, Amsterdam said: \u201cThere are signs that G\u00fclen is working closely with certain members of military leadership against the elected civilian government.\u201d G\u00fclen\u2019s group, the Alliance for Shared Values, was quick to deny it, issuing a statement saying comments alleging the group\u2019s involvement in the coup were \u201chighly irresponsible\u201d and that the group did not support the military intervention: Events on the ground are moving quickly and it would be irresponsible for us to speculate on them. We remain concerned about the safety and security of Turkish citizens and those in Turkey right now. For more than 40 years, Fethullah G\u00fclen and Hizmet participants have advocated for, and demonstrated their commitment to, peace and democracy. We have consistently denounced military interventions in domestic politics. These are core values of Hizmet participants. We condemn any military intervention in domestic politics of Turkey. Bulgaria is boosting patrols along the border with Turkey, as Turkey has closed border crossings, Reuters reports: The foreign ministry appealed to Bulgarians to cancel their travel plans to Turkey. \u201cWe are following what is happening at our neighbours with concern,\u201d prime minister Boiko Borisov told reporters at an emergency meeting with the defence and foreign ministers, as well as intelligence and security officials. \u201cLet\u2019s hope it will regularise in a lawful and democratic manner \u2026 There are ways to topple a government and that in the democratic world happens through elections,\u201d he said. Bulgarian foreign minister Daniel Mitov spoke on the telephone with his Turkish counterpart and contacts were made by the special services, Borisov added. The border crossings with Turkey on the Bulgarian side are open. A witness told private national BTV channel that entrance at Kapikule border crossing into Turkey is allowed, but exit towards Bulgaria is not and several cars with Bulgarians were blocked on Turkish territory. Bulgaria has built a fence at its border with Turkey as part of its attempts to limit illegal crossings of migrants from conflicts in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. \u201cThe border crossings from the Turkish side are closed. We have beefed up the border with border police officers and army units,\u201d Borisov said. US Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton says: I am following the fast-moving developments in Turkey tonight with great concern. We should all urge calm and respect for laws, institutions, and basic human rights and freedoms \u2013 and support for the democratically elected civilian government. All parties should work to avoid further violence and bloodshed, and the safety of American citizens and diplomatic missions must be ensured. Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau says: We call for restraint by all parties. Canada supports the preservation of Turkish democracy, and condemns any attempt to subvert Turkey\u2019s democratic institutions by force of arms. We have more information on those killed in Ankara overnight. The prosecutor\u2019s office says most of the 42 people who died were civilians. Seventeen of the dead were police officers. In addition, a senior Turkish official says 13 soldiers who tried to storm the presidential palace have been arrested. \u00d6mer \u00c7elik, Turkey\u2019s minister for EU affairs, has tweeted these images of the parliament building as dawn breaks in the country: It was earlier reported that a number of police officers were killed in an explosion at a building in the parliament complex. Turkey\u2019s NTV television has cited the prosecutor\u2019s office in Ankara saying that at least 42 people have been killed in the capital overnight. This has not been confirmed and it\u2019s not known at this stage whether those killed include military personnel involved in the coup, protesters who were urged to come on to the streets, or police officers who were reportedly hit in the explosion at the parliament building. It\u2019s still very unclear what is happening in Ankara, where rebel soldiers are still said to be firing, and an explosion earlier hit the parliament building. Images from the capital show many people \u2013 as well as tanks \u2013 on the streets in scenes of protest and chaos. There are also images of people who appear to be dead or injured; we will not publish those. Although it is evident from reports and images from Turkey that the situation is still extemely tense and unpredictable, prime minister Yildirim has told the state-run Anadolu news agency: Things are getting better every minute. Yildirim said people should remain in the streets to support the government. But he warned that some air force planes flown by those engaged in the coup remain in the air. Those aircraft will be shot down, Yildirim said. The Turkish prime minister Binali Yildirim claims that those involved in the coup are now mostly under the control of military senior command \u2013 but that rebel soldiers are still firing in Istanbul and Ankara. Yildirim says he has received reports that a general \u2013 one of those behind the coup \u2013 has been killed, and more than 130 others involved have been detained. The UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon has also weighed in to call for an end to the attempted coup. In a statement, Ban called for \u201ccalm, non-violence and restraint\u201d, saying it was \u201ca moment of uncertainty\u201d: Military interference in the affairs of any state is unacceptable. It will be crucial to quickly and peacefully affirm civilian rule and constitutional order in accordance with principles of democracy. Preservation of fundamental rights, including freedom of speech and assembly, remain of vital importance. Turkey is not a member of the European Union, although it is seeking to be. Officials of the EU \u2013 the president of the European council, Donald Tusk; the president of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker; and the EU high representative for foreign affairs, Federica Mogherini \u2013 have issued a statement supporting the Turkish government tonight: Turkey is a key partner for the European Union. The EU fully supports the democratically elected government, the institutions of the country and the rule of law. We call for a swift return to Turkey\u2019s constitutional order. We continue to follow closely the developments and to coordinate with the 28 EU member states. Reports coming out of Turkey remain conflicting and it will be some time before a clearer picture emerges of who \u2013 if anyone \u2013 is in control. Here is what we know and don\u2019t know at this stage. A military coup has been attempted in Turkey, in a bid to oust the president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, accusing him of undermining the country\u2019s secular traditions. Erdo\u011fan, who returned to Istanbul in the early hours of the morning from his holiday in the resort of Marmaris, said the attempted coup was \u201ctreason\u201d undertaken by \u201ca minority within our armed forces\u201d and vowed to use it as an opportunity to \u201cclean up\u201d the army. The president urged people to take to the streets in defence of the government, prompting chaotic scenes as thousands protested alongside tanks. Turkish officials insisted the coup had been \u201crepelled\u201d, with more than 50 military officers arrested in Istanbul. General Zekai Aksakalli, the commander of Turkey\u2019s military special forces, said: Those who are attempting a coup will not succeed \u2026 Our people should know that we will overcome this ... We are in control of the situation. But reports from Turkey suggested the situation was far from under control, with gunfire heard in the capital, Ankara, and in Istanbul. Erdo\u011fan said prime minister Binali Yildirim had given orders to \u201ceradicate\u201d those who were shooting. The state news agency Anadolu said a bomb had hit the parliament building in Ankara. The parliament speaker Ismail Kahraman said the bomb hit one corner of a building inside the complex, injuring a number of police officers. Flights were diverted from Istanbul\u2019s Ataturk airport and departures cancelled after reports of explosions there. Media outlets including CNN Turk and Hurriyet were overrun with soldiers and shut down, with some reports that journalists have been arrested. Authorities in Turkey may be blocking or slowing access to social media networks including Twitter and Facebook. President Erdo\u011fan also said his general secretary was abducted by coup makers, according to the Associated Press. There was no information on the chief of military staff. Meanwhile in Istanbul, an official with the president\u2019s office said more than 50 military officers have been arrested and large crowds have carried out multiple citizen arrests, the AP reports. Turkish\u2019s elected president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan has just spoken on live TV in Turkey (earlier, he delivered remarks via the highly unorthodox format of a FaceTime broadcast on a mobile phone shown to a CNN Turkey TV camera). Erdo\u011fan said the uprising was an act of \u201ctreason\u201d and that those responsible will pay a \u201cheavy price\u201d, according to Reuters. The president also said the prime minister has given orders to \u201ceradicate\u201d those who are shooting from the air. He further said the uprising was carried out by a \u201cminority\u201d within the military who can\u2019t stomach unity of the country. Erdo\u011fan said some in military have been taking orders from cleric Fethullah Gulen and that the attempted coup shows the Gulen structure is an armed terrorist organization. Gulen has denied involvement. According to Reuters\u2019 translation, the president said he would not hand Turkey over to occupiers and said the cabinet is functioning in Ankara. Erdo\u011fan further said he will stay \u201cwith my people\u201d. NTV television is now showing footage of large crowds gathering at Istanbul\u2019s Ataturk Airport to greet President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan as he emerges from a vehicle upon landing, the Associated Press reports. There are reports of sounds of explosions in or near Taksim Square, where crowds have been gathering in the heart of Istanbul throughout the night. It\u2019s unclear if the blast sounds are explosions, sonic booms from fighter jets, or both. The AP reports two large explosions near the square where, the agency states, police and military have been exchanging fire. Shortly before, Reuters reported that around 30 Turkish soldiers who were part of a faction attempting to carry out the military coup surrendered their weapons after being surrounded by armed police. The soldiers handed over their guns and were taken away in police vans as a fighter jet repeatedly screeched overhead at low altitude, causing a boom that shook surrounding buildings and shattered windows, Reuters reported. The Guardian\u2019s Ghaith Abdul-Ahad has filed this report from Istanbul: As news of the attempted coup unfolded, chaos and panic erupted in Istiklal, Istanbul\u2019s main pedestrian thoroughfare. People ran in different directions, some away from the street and some into the streets. Restaurant owners gathered tables inside and pulled down shutters. In Taksim sqaure at one end of Istiklal \u2013 where the country\u2019s coups were made and unmade in the past 50 years \u2013 a group of soldiers, young in green helmets, rifles and military fatigues, stood blocking the square. Mohamad, a 30-year-old office worker, stood watching the soldiers, dressed in a white shirt and blue slacks. \u201cTurkey has regressed in the past few years under [president] Erdo\u011fan, and the army came out to restore the balance that\u2019s the traditional role of the army here.\u201d Gradually, another crowd opposed to the army gathered, pushing to the centre of the square, chanting \u201cArmy get out\u201d and \u201cno for the coup\u201d. A shouting match between the two sides followed, and soon after the president called for his supporters to take to the streets, thousands flooded the square. \u201cI don\u2019t support Erdo\u011fan, but I don\u2019t want the military to take away our democracy,\u201d said Najdat, a 50 year old government functionary. \u201cWe have seen them before, and we have waited for democracy for 30 years.\u201d A group of soldiers has landed in the Dogan Media Center where CNN T\u00fcrk is based, the news station is now reporting. A Facebook Live video showed the chaos inside. There are also reports of the Hurriyet Daily News facing soldiers. The CNN building is also home to Kanal D television, the Dogan news agency and the Hurriyet paper, according to the Associated Press. Reuters and others report that president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s plane is landing in Istanbul: A Turkish national intelligence spokesman has claimed that the coup has been \u201crepelled\u201d, amid a concerted effort by both the government and military to portray the sense that their respective side is in power. According to the Associated Press, government officials, including president Recep Erdo\u011fan, have tried to play down reports that the military is in control. At the same time, Gen Zekai Aksakalli, the commander of Turkey\u2019s military special forces, said that \u201cthose who are attempting a coup will not succeed\u201d. He told NTV television: Our people should know that we will overcome this ... We are in control of the situation. He also said some deaths and injuries were reported during the coup attempt, without providing any details. Turkish media reports have also reported that MIT, the national intelligence agency, as saying the coup has been defeated, according to the Associated Press. Live video from the streets of Istanbul and Ankara suggests that the situation remains fluid and chaotic. Turkey may be blocking or slowing access to social media networks amid an attempted military coup, although there are conflicting reports emerging from the country that\u2019s been described as a \u201cbastion of internet censorship\u201d by the Electronic Freedom Foundation. Turkey Blocks, an organization that monitors internet censorship in the country, tweeted on Friday evening that Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube were being blocked, but that Vimeo and Instagram were still functioning. Internet censorship in Turkey typically occurs when the government orders internet service providers to block access to certain domains, according to Deji Olukotun of Access Now, a digital rights advocacy group. Read the Guardian\u2019s full report on possible social media censorship here: A bomb has reportedly hit the Turkish parliament in Ankara, according to the Associated Press, citing Anadolu Agency, a state news agency. The extent of any damage or possible injuries was not immediately clear. A resident who lived near the area told the AP that he \u201cheard a massive explosion that shook buildings and saw a column of smoke\u201d, but couldn\u2019t confirm if it was coming directly from parliament. The person said fighter jets were flying low in the area. CNN-Turk television reported some police officers and parliament workers were hurt in the bomb attack. Nato\u2019s chief has issued a call for \u201cfull respect\u201d for Turkey\u2019s democratic institutions and constitution, according to the Associated Press. Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg said in a statement: I have just spoken to the Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu. I am following events in Turkey closely and with concern. The statement continued, \u201cI call for calm and restraint, and full respect for Turkey\u2019s democratic institutions and its constitution. ...Turkey is a valued Nato ally.\u201d Here\u2019s the Guardian\u2019s analysis of how the attempted Turkey coup attempt could destabilize a western ally in a region already reeling from war, terrorism and mass migration: The Turkish military\u2019s apparent attempt to seize power on Friday unleashed panic in the streets and sent shockwaves through Nato and across the Middle East. With the state broadcaster TRT off the air, and martial law and a curfew declared across the country, people in Istanbul scrambled to get indoors as military jets flew overhead. The extraordinary turn of events also baffled many in the foreign policy community, many of whom perceived Turkey\u2019s elected government as relatively stable. Read the full story here: It is now after 2.20am in Istanbul, but live video footage appears to show crowds flooding onto the streets, gathering the Bosphorus Bridge and Taksim Square, apparently heeding the request from president Recep Erdo\u011fan to resist the attempted coup. The crowds are directly defying a command from the military, which has declared martial law and implemented a curfew. TV footage is showing chaotic scenes; some shots appear to show jubilant crowds of hundreds waving flags. There is video of groups of men marching and chanting through Istanbul Ataturk International Airport, and footage of groups of men doing the same in residential streets in the suburbs of the city. Still more footage, from other parts of the city, have shown civilians appearing to confront military vehicles on bridges, or near government buildings, alongside the sound of occasional gunfire. One witness has told CNN that as many as 1,000 people are now at the airport, some of whom have gained access to the tarmac. Turkey\u2019s DHA TV network has broadcast images of hundreds of men surrounding a military vehicle, chanting, shouting and occasionally hurling missiles and punches at military personnel, who are taking shelter behind riot shields. Others show crowds seemingly cheering men in military fatigues. The White House has just released a statement on the reports of an attempted coup, saying that Barack Obama and secretary of state John Kerry \u201cagreed that all parties in Turkey should support the democratically-elected Government of Turkey, show restraint, and avoid any violence or bloodshed\u201d. The state department will \u201ccontinue to focus on the safety and security of US citizens in Turkey,\u201d the statement added. Here\u2019s some video footage capturing the chaos in Turkey right now, including scenes at the Bosphorus Bridge where armed personnel were seen patrolling and in the capital Ankara where gunshots were heard. Former prime minister Ahmet Davuto\u011flu has told al-Jazeera in an interview that the attempted coup is utilizing \u201cillegal methods\u201d and constitutes an \u201can attack against democracy\u201d. From the New York Times, Davuto\u011flu said: Stability of Turkey means stability of many other countries, and the stability of Turkey means the stability of a safe haven of millions of refugees. If it is harmed, the domino effect cannot be prevented. Davuto\u011flu repeatedly suggested that the coup was being led merely by a \u201cclique\u201d in the military and said he expected the coup to fail. \u201cThroughout my life we have seen many attempts by these types of cliques in the army,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were not able to succeed for a long time and, after so many years, I am sure we will protect our dignity, our democracy.\u201d Here\u2019s a live-stream looking onto the Bosphorus bridge in Istanbul: The US state department has issued an \u201cemergency alert\u201d for Americans in Turkey, saying: Shots fired and explosions have been heard in Ankara and both bridges in Istanbul, the Bosphorous and Faith Sultan Mehmet, are now closed. Martial law and a curfew have been imposed in Turkey. All flights at Atat\u00fcrk Istanbul airport have been suspended. The statement notes that although there are reports that social media may be blocked, US citizens should attempt to contact family and friends by phone or email. Tanks have opened fire near the Turkish parliament building, Reuters reports, following similar reports from NTV and local journalists about gunfire in Ankara and Istanbul. Protesters have heard Erdo\u011fan\u2019s call to take to the streets, though, and some are chanting \u201cshoulder to shoulder against the coup\u201d. Others have squared off with military forces who\u2019ve closed bridges and streets. In one video, a policeman and military officer argue in a crowd in the street; in another, cars jammed in traffic honked horns in unison as people mill among them. In a third, a crowd sings and lifts up a huge Turkish flag. Photos posted on social media shows protesters climbing onto a tank and challenging the military, and live video, streaming on Facebook, showed throngs of people in the streets around the country. Prof Omer Taspinar, a senior fellow at Brookings Institution who has repeatedly warned of a military coup in Turkey in recent months, said a critical question would be the degree to which the entire military command was involved in the attempted coup: The situation is really fluid. Right now the question is whether the attempted coup is from the top command, with the top brass involved, or a colonel-level or officer-coup, from a certain segment of the army. There are indications right now that it is the latter. The chief of staff of the military has not spoken yet and traditionally with Turkish coups you would expect the head of the military to be on TV taking command.\u201d He continued: \u201cThis will rattle the Turkish markets. It will tarnish the country\u2019s image. My analysis is that this will certainly be embarrassing for the country\u2019s recently re-elected president, Recep Erdo\u011fan. The signs are chaotic right now but I think the rumors of Erdo\u011fan\u2019s demise would be highly exaggerated given he has been on TV.\u201d Taspinar said the most dangerous risk was a breakout in fighting between divisions within the Turkish military and police forces and intelligence factions aligned between with Erdo\u011fan\u2019s interior ministry. \u201cI don\u2019t expect that to happen, but if it does it would be devastating to Turkey.\u201d There is chaos and confusion in Turkey amid reports of an attempted military coup. Turkey\u2019s armed forces have said they \u201cfully seized control\u201d of the country on Friday night. President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan has called on Turks to take to the streets in a show of support for the government. Erdo\u011fan just made a statement in an interview over FaceTime with CNN Turk. Prime minister Binali Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m said: \u201cOur people should know that we will not allow any activity that would harm democracy.\u201d Gunshots are being heard in the capital Ankara as military planes flew low overhead. Soldiers have blocked entry to Atat\u00fcrk airport, and four stations are reportedly stationed there. Here\u2019s video of the incredible moment of Erdo\u011fan using FaceTime to broadcast his message. President Erdo\u011fan called on Turks to take to the streets in a surreal interview with CNN T\u00fcrk, in which he was forced to speak to the network via a mobile phone and FaceTime. I urge the Turkish people to gather at public squares and airports. ... There is no power higher than the power of the people.\u201d He added that he believes the coup attempt will be thwarted soon, and that there will be a \u201cstrong response\u201d to those responsible for the coup attempt. They will receive the \u201cheavy price\u201d, he said. The president was speaking from an undisclosed location, and NBC News, citing an anonymous US military source, said that his plane had been refused landing rights in Istanbul. Boris Johnson echoing the earlier statement from Foreign Office officials: A presidential source has said: \u201cThis is a coup attempt by the Gulen movement, at which several known Gulenists hinted in recent months. The perpetrators have violated the chain in command.\u201d Here\u2019s an interesting piece on the Gulenist movement. John Kerry, US secretary of state, said he had heard the reports but could not comment. \u201cI hope there will be stability and peace and continuity within Turkey,\u201d he said while visiting Moscow. Ned Price, spokesperson for the national security council at the White House, said: \u201cThe president\u2019s national security team has apprised him of the unfolding situation in Turkey. The president will continue to receive regular updates.\u201d Turkey has the second biggest army in Nato after the US. It was a crucial ally during the cold war, although relations hit a bump in March 2003 when Turkey refused to let the US to invade Iraq from the north through Turkish territory. Now they are military partners, albeit with significant political differences, in the fight against Islamic State. Last year Turkey agreed to let US warplanes and armed drones use the Incirlik air base, just 60 miles from the north-west Syrian border, to carry out raids against Isis. The aircraft had previously flown from Iraq or Arab allies such as Jordan. Loss of the Turkish base would be a severe blow to the ongoing effort against Isis, especially after recent terrorist attacks within Belgium, France, Turkey and the US itself. Turkey, which by the end of 2015 was hosting 2.5 million refugees \u2013 mostly from neighbouring Syria, has objected to US support for Kurdish forces operating in northern Syria against Isis. Washington has said it draws a clear distinction between the PKK, a foreign terrorist organisation, and the Syrian Kurds, whom it sees as one of many groups fighting Isis. Mark Toner, deputy spokesperson for the US State Department, said last month: \u201cTurkey is playing an important role with regard to Syria, with regard to the conflict there, both from the Assad regime as well as with Daesh [Isis]. So I don\u2019t want to underplay that. But they have, as many countries do within the coalition, sometimes different priorities, different ideas about how to go about that, and that\u2019s something we\u2019re in constant dialogue with them about and working to coordinate better.\u201d This is how the Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan addressed the nation amid a military coup this evening: My colleague Alan Yuhas says that Erdo\u011fan said believed the coup attempt would be thwarted soon and that there would be a \u201cstrong response\u201d to those responsible for the coup attempt. They will pay a \u201cheavy price\u201d, he said. The president was speaking from an undisclosed location and NBC News, citing an anonymous US military source, said that his plane had been refused landing rights in Istanbul. The Foreign Office has advised British citizens in Turkey to avoid public places and remain vigilant until the situation there becomes clearer. A statement read: \u201cWe are concerned by events unfolding in Ankara and Istanbul.\u201d Access to Facebook, Twitter and YouTube was restricted in Turkey on Friday, shortly after news broke that the military coup was under way, according to two internet monitoring groups. Reuters reported that Turkey Blocks, a group that monitors internet shutdowns in the country, and Dyn, which monitors internet performance and traffic globally, both said it was difficult or impossible to access social media services in Turkey. The Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan has previously restricted access to some social media platforms. The Turkish state broadcaster TRT has now gone off air, say the Reuters news agency and sources in Turkey. The Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan has said that the coup is the work of a minority within the military. Speaking to CNN Turk, he adds: \u201cWe will overcome this.\u201d My colleague Ghaith Abdul-Ahad is in Istanbul. He reports that there is chaos on the main thoroughfare Istiklal, with people running in all directions. Restaurants and shops are closing, somtehing is happening on Taksim Square and Tarlabashi Boulevard seems to be closed. Cars are honking their horns and driving on the wrong side of the road. A lot of people are walking from the direction of Taksim. There is a sense of agitation, with people checking their phones or listening to the radio. More details from the statement read out on the state broadcaster TRT at the behest of the military faction that seems to be behind the coup: It says that the freedom of Turkish citizens is guaranteed by what is referred to as a \u201cpeace council\u201d, regardless of religion, race or language. It says the Peace Council will not allow public order to be damaged. It is worth remembering at this point that the Turkish government still claims to be in charge. An EU source monitoring events has told Reuters that military forces have control of airports and strategic points in Istanbul. The White House says President Obama is aware of the developments in Turkey and will receive regular updates. An announcement on the Turkish state broadcaster TRT says that a curfew has been declared across Turkey and that airports are closed. The announcer says they are being made to read a statement by the military. The statement promises a new constitution for the country and says that democracy and the secular rule of law had been undermined. Martial law has also been imposed, it adds. The head of the Istanbul branch of Turkey\u2019s ruling AK party says soldiers entered the party building and asked them to leave, CNN Turk reports. France\u2019s foreign ministry has also advised its citizens in Turkey to stay indoors. The US secretary of state John Kerry says he hopes there will be peace, stability and unity within Turkey amid reports that a military coup is underway. Soldiers are inside the buildings of the Turkish state broadcaster TRT in the country\u2019s capital Ankara, a correspondent for that outlet tells the Reuters news agency. We understand that the Turkish president is due to make a statement shortly. The full Turkish military statement reads: \u201cTurkish Armed Forces have completely taken over the administration of the country to reinstate constitutional order, human rights and freedoms, the rule of law and general security that was damaged. \u201cAll international agreements are still valid. We hope that all of our good relationships with all countries will continue.\u201d The Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan is on holiday and reportedly outside the country. Reuters has quoted a source within his office as saying that he is safe. There are numerous reports that hostages have been taken in the Turkish capital, Ankara. CNN Turk say they\u2019re being held at a military HQ there. The state-run Anadolu press agency says the chief of military staff is among those being held. Presidential sources say: \u201cThis is an attack against Turkish democracy. A group within the armed forces has made an attempt to overthrow the democratically elected government outside the chain of command. \u201cThe statement made on behalf of the Armed Forces wasn\u2019t authorised by the military command. We urge the world to stand in solidarity with the Turkish people.\u201d Some more detail on the statement said to come from Turkey\u2019s armed forces. They have reportedly said in emails reported on Turkish TV that they have taken power to protect the democratic order and to maintain human rights. They added that all of Turkey\u2019s existing foreign relations would be maintained and that the rule of law would remain the priority. The Guardian has not seen the correspondence and, therefore, can yet verify where it has come from or on behalf of whom - exactly - it was sent. A solider in Istanbul has been filmed saying \u201cit\u2019s a coup, go home.\u201d The Associated Press is now carrying fuller quotes from the Turkish prime minister\u2019s interview with NTV. Having confirmed his belief that an attempted coup was underway, Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m said: \u201cWe are focusing on the possibility of an attempt [coup]. There was an illegal act by a group within the military that was acting out of the chain of military command. Our people should know that we will not allow any activity that would harm democracy.\u201d The Dogan news agency said one-way traffic on the Bosporus and Fatih Sultan Mehmet bridges were blocked. Video footage showed the bridge being blocked by military vehicles. The Turkish military says in a statement that it has taken over, according to Reuters. The Guardian has heard reports that the UN has emailed staff, saying a coup attempt is underway. According to the Associated Press, Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, who was speaking to the local TV station NTV, said: \u201cIt is correct that there was an attempt.\u201d He provided no further details but said Turkey would never allow any \u201cinitiative that would interrupt democracy\u201d. Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m says those responsible for what he has called an attempted military coup will pay the highest price. A witness in the country\u2019s capital told Reuters that gunshots were heard as military jets and helicopters were seen flying overhead. Witnesses in Istanbul, Turkey\u2019s biggest city, also spotted helicopters overhead, the agency reported. The local broadcaster NTV reported that both of Istanbul\u2019s bridges across the Bosphorus, the strait separating the European and Asian sides of the city, had been closed to traffic. It was not immediately clear if the events were related. The Turkish prime minister Binali Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m says that an attempted coup by parts of the military has been launched, according to Reuters. He reportedly added that security forces were doing what they could to resolve the situation.",

Boris Johnson, the new foreign secretary, David Davis, the new Brexit secretary and Liam Fox, the new international trade secretary, will be in charge of making Brexit work.</p> <p><strong>2 - Johnson\u2019s appointment represents a glittering promotion for him - but perhaps a demotion for the Foreign Office. </strong>Superficially it is an odd appointment, because it won\u2019t take long to compile quite a long list of countries and foreign leaders Johnson has offended in the past, but he likes to be liked and he may forge good relations with his counterparts. But the new arrangements also suggest the Foreign Office is being downsized. It used to be in charge of aid, but under Labour it lost that to DfID. Now it is losing Brexit (to Davis\u2019s department) and international trade (to Fox\u2019s department). What\u2019s left for Johnson? Handing out the Ferrero Rocher?</p> <p>On the subject of Johnson, the Foreign Office permanent secretary<strong> Simon McDonald</strong> has tweeted this. He has an odd idea of \u201cvery happy\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SMcDonaldFCO/status/753317140502052864\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson\">@BorisJohnson</a> has just arrived <a href=\"https://twitter.com/foreignoffice\">@foreignoffice</a>.

Other former ministers may be hoping for a comeback tomorrow.</p> <p><strong>4 - But it does not seem to be quite as good for women as some of the overnight briefing suggested.</strong> We were told women would get top jobs, but May has only appointed one woman tonight.</p> <p><strong>5 - May has broken up the Cameron/Osborne clique.</strong> George Osborne is the only figure so far we know to have been sacked, and it is hard to think May thought he would have been a worse foreign secretary than Johnson. Perhaps she holds some grudge against him. It may take a while before we learn the full story of his departure, but it means that the two figures who ran Tory politics for the past 11 years have now gone.</p> <p><strong>6 - May clearly doesn\u2019t rate Andrea Leadsom as a top talent. </strong>(Which isn\u2019t suprising - few other people do.)</p> <p><strong>7 - Michael Gove can be seen as a loser - because while three other leading Brexiteers have been promoted, he hasn\u2019t, or at least he hasn\u2019t so far.</strong> There is a good chance May will keep him as justice secretary.</p> <p><strong>8 - Running Theresa May\u2019s campaign has, contrary to expectations, failed to put Chris Grayling, the leader of the Commons, into a top job.</strong> Grayling has been telling interviewers all day that he did not back May because he expected promotion. But that did not stop people thinking he might get one. So far it hasn\u2019t arrived, althought it is still possible he might get a cabinet upgrade tomorrow.</p> <p>That\u2019s all from me for tonight.</p> <p>My colleague Chris Johnston is taking over now.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-07-13T20:23:56.491Z\">at 9.23pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57869bf5e4b073c22786c17d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-07-13T20:08:31.526Z\">9.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Spare a thought for poor Palmerston.

To serve our country in this role is a privilege and an honour.</p> <p>These are challenging times for Britain. The decision to leave the European Union has created enormous economic uncertainty and insecurity.

The sentiments are good ones, but just like her predecessor the rhetoric is much better than the reality. The truth is Theresa May has been at the heart of the Tory government for the last six years and is tied to its record. It\u2019s a record of failing to stand up for working people and backing policies that are putting vital public services like the NHS at risk. </p> <p>The Labour party will continue to hold this failing government to account and push for a fairer alternative \u2013 that is what the country deserves.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-07-13T18:22:45.410Z\">at 7.22pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57868145e4b08239dbab7212\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-07-13T17:59:04.113Z\">6.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Philip Hammond, </strong>the foreign secretary, has just gone into No 10.</p> <p>He is being tipped to emerge as chancellor.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-07-13T18:02:03.818Z\">at 7.02pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57867c3ae4b073c22786c140\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-07-13T17:58:23.352Z\">6.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Theresa May's speech - Verdict from the Twitter commentariat</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is some reaction to Theresa May\u2019s speech from the political journalists and commentators on Twitter. </p> <p>Generally, it is pretty positive.</p> <p>From the Times\u2019s <strong>Tim Montgomerie</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/montie/status/753274542907355137\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Theresa May is going to defy right/left labels.

She committed herself to leading a one-nation government.</p> <p>Effectively, she was redefining the name of the Conservative party. Officially it is the Conservative and Unionist party. The \u201cunionist\u201d refers to the UK (normally thought of now primarily in terms of England/Scotland, but originally it referred to the union of Britain and Ireland). But May insisted it should also refer to the union of rich and poor. It was an interesting piece of creative interpretation, because in the past others have not read it like this. She said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In David Cameron I follow in the footsteps of a great modern prime minister. Under David\u2019s leadership the government stabilised the economy, reduced the budget deficit and helped more people into work than ever before. But David\u2019s true legacy is not about the economy but about social justice. From the introduction of same-sex marriage to taking people on low wages out of income tax altogether, David Cameron has led a one-nation government and it is in that spirit that I also plan to lead.</p> <p>Because not everybody knows this, but the full title of my party is the Conservative and Unionist party. And that word, unionist, is very important to me. It means we believe in the union, the precious, precious bond between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. But it means something else that is just as important. It means we believe in a union not just between the nations of the United Kingdom but between all of our citizens \u2013 every one of us \u2013 whoever we are and wherever we\u2019re from. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-07-13T17:30:40.153Z\">at 6.30pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5786756ee4b08239dbab71ed\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-07-13T17:08:51.956Z\">6.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>After posing for photographs with her husband, Philip, on the steps of Downing Street, she heads into No 10, where the staff will be lining up to greet her.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-07-13T17:10:12.092Z\">at 6.10pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57867427e4b073c22786c12b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-07-13T17:07:15.049Z\">6.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Theresa May's speech</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Theresa May</strong> says the Queen has asked her to form a government and she has accepted.</p> <p>David Cameron was a great modern prime minister, she says.

But it also refers to the union of all our citizens, whoever they are.</p> <p>That means fighting against social injustice, she says.</p> <p>She is using a passage very similar to this one in her speech on Monday.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Right now, if you\u2019re born poor, you will die on average nine years earlier than others. If you\u2019re black, you\u2019re treated more harshly by the criminal justice system than if you\u2019re white.

You have your own home, but you worry about mortgage rates going up. You can just about manage, but you worry about the cost of living and the quality of the local school, because there\u2019s no other choice for you.</p> </blockquote> <p>She says the government she leads will not be driven by the interests of the privileged few.</p> <p>She will try to give people more control, she says.</p> <p>And when she has to make the big calls, she will think what is in the interests of ordinary people. <br></p> <p>She says she wants Britain to work, not just for the privileged few, but for everyone.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-07-13T17:09:38.331Z\">at 6.09pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57867400e4b033b610b6dc7d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-07-13T17:01:57.013Z\">6.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/faisalislam/status/753273120576901120\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Downing streets gates open for new PM <a href=\"https://t.co/r0YJhnxfCY\">pic.twitter.com/r0YJhnxfCY</a></p>&mdash; Faisal Islam (@faisalislam) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/faisalislam/status/753273120576901120\">July 13, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-578673bce4b073c22786c127\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-07-13T17:01:01.970Z\">6.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is the statement from the Palace.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BBCPeterHunt/status/753272663611768832\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Buckingham Palace; The Queen received in audience the Right Hon Theresa May MP this evening and requested her to form a new Administration</p>&mdash; Peter Hunt (@BBCPeterHunt) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCPeterHunt/status/753272663611768832\">July 13, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BBCPeterHunt/status/753272836639383552\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The Rt Hon Theresa May accepted Her Majesty&#39;s offer and Kissed Hands upon her appointment as Prime Minister and First Lord of the Treasury.</p>&mdash; Peter Hunt (@BBCPeterHunt) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCPeterHunt/status/753272836639383552\">July 13, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-578672fce4b073c22786c11f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-07-13T16:59:15.658Z\">5.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Theresa May is leaving Buckingham Palace.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-578672eae4b08239dbab71e2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-07-13T16:57:28.400Z\">5.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/benatipsosmori/status/753271726205698049\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Crowds waiting for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theresa_may\">@theresa_may</a> - fever pitch!!

It was not a particularly remarkable speech, but it was noteworthy what he chose to stress: the economy (employment, lower taxes, the \u201cnational living wage\u201d etc) and progressive, social justice measures (like increasing the aid budget, adoption reform and the national citizen service). There was not anything very party political in it (unsurprisingly) and there was only a brief reference to the issue that brought about his resignation, the EU referendum and Brexit.</p> <p>Cameron fought the 2010 general election committed to creating the Big Society but over the next few years this was abandoned as a priority, partly because of austerity and partly because it turned out to be a vision with little electoral appeal. Cameron, though, never entirely gave up his belief in this vision and, although this speech did not contain what was once his catchphrase, it did end with a passage praising volunteers for \u201cmaking our society bigger and stronger\u201d and insisting that \u201cthe spirit of service is one of this country\u2019s most remarkable qualities\u201d. It sounded like the last gasp of the Big Society.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-07-13T16:52:32.473Z\">at 5.52pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57866c81e4b0048693f6b106\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-07-13T16:29:58.086Z\">5.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BBCNewsbeat/status/753264859219918848\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Theresa May is currently in a meeting with The Queen where she&#39;ll be asked to form a new government <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/DavidCameron?src=hash\">#DavidCameron</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/OzPA88ZS7m\">pic.twitter.com/OzPA88ZS7m</a></p>&mdash; BBC Newsbeat (@BBCNewsbeat) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCNewsbeat/status/753264859219918848\">July 13, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_25Z0MbCDDQ\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_25Z0MbCDDQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-07-13T16:51:46.811Z\">at 5.51pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57866a93e4b0048693f6b0fe\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-07-13T16:22:42.797Z\">5.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Buckingham Palace has announced that David Cameron has resigned.</p> <p>Theresa May is now leaving the Commons and heading for Buckingham Palace.</p> <p>(For the next few minutes, no one is running the country.)</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-578664efe4b0048693f6b0e0\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-07-13T16:08:16.886Z\">5.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Cameron's speech \u2013 full text</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is the full text of David Cameron\u2019s statement outside No 10.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Good afternoon. When I first stood here in Downing Street on that evening in May 2010, I said we would confront our problems as a country and lead people through difficult decisions so that together we could reach better times. </p> <p>It\u2019s not been an easy journey and of course we have not got every decision right, but I do believe that today our country is much stronger. </p> <p>Above all it was about turning around the economy and with the deficit cut by two-thirds, two and a half million more people in work and 1m more businesses, there can be no doubt that our economy is immeasurably stronger. </p> <p>Politicians like to talk about policies but in the end it is about people\u2019s lives. </p> <p>I think of the people doing jobs who were previously unemployed. I think of the businesses that were just ideas in someone\u2019s head and that today are making a go of it and providing people with livelihoods. </p> <p>I think of the hardworking families paying lower taxes and getting higher wages because of the first ever national living wage. </p> <p>I think of the children who were languishing in the care system, and who have now been adopted by loving families. </p> <p>I think of the parents now able to send their children to good and outstanding schools, including free schools that simply didn\u2019t exist before. </p> <p>I think of over 200,000 young people who have taken part in national citizen service, the fastest growing youth programme of its kind in the world, something that again wasn\u2019t there six years ago.</p> <p>I think of the couples who have been able to get married who weren\u2019t allowed to in the past. </p> <p>And I think of the people on the other side of the world who wouldn\u2019t have had clean drinking water, the chance to go to school or even be alive were it not for our decision to keep our aid promises to the poorest people and the poorest countries in our world. </p> <p>And we have used our stronger economy to invest in our health service. When I walked in there, there were 18,000 people waiting over a year for their operation. </p> <p>Today it\u2019s just 800 \u2013 too many, still too long but our NHS is a national treasure and one whose staff perform miracles as I\u2019ve seen every day. </p> <p>And we\u2019ve strengthened our nation\u2019s defences, with submarines, destroyers and frigates, and, soon, aircraft carriers rolling out of our shipyards to keep our country safe in a dangerous world. </p> <p>These are the choices and the changes that we have made. And I want to thank everyone who has given so much to support me personally over these years. The incredible team in No 10, the civil servants, whose professionalism and impartiality is one of our country\u2019s greatest strengths. And my political advisers, some of whom have been with me since the day I stood for my party\u2019s leadership 11 years ago.</p> <p>I want to thank my children, Nancy, Elwen and Florence, for whom Downing Street has been a lovely home over these last six years. They sometimes kick the red boxes full of work. Florence \u2013 you once climbed into one, before a foreign trip, and said take me with you. No more boxes. </p> <p>And above all, I want to thank Samantha, the love of my life. You have kept me vaguely sane and, as well as being an amazing wife, mother and businesswoman, you have done something every week in that building behind me to celebrate the best spirit of voluntary service in our country.</p> <p>We will shortly be heading to Buckingham Palace to see Her Majesty the Queen, where I will tender my resignation as prime minister and I will advise Her Majesty to invite Theresa May to form a new administration.</p> <p>I am delighted that for the second time in British history the new prime minister will be a woman \u2013 and once again a Conservative. I believe Theresa will provide strong and stable leadership in fulfilling the Conservative manifesto on which we were elected, and I wish her well in negotiating the best possible terms for Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union.</p> <p>Let me finish by saying this. The spirit of service is one of this country\u2019s most remarkable qualities. I have seen that service day in and day out in the incredible work of our armed forces, our intelligence agencies and our police. It is something I always knew. But as prime minister you see it so directly that it blows you away. And of course writing those heart-breaking letters to the families who have lost loved ones is a poignant reminder of the profound scale of what these men and women give for us in the defence of our freedoms and our way of life. We must never forget that.</p> <p>In a different way, I have seen that same spirit of service in the amazing contributions of countless volunteers in communities up and down our country who are making our society bigger and stronger. And I am proud that every day for the past two years I have used the office of prime minister in a non-political way to recognise and thank almost 600 of them as Points of Light whose service can be an inspiration to us all.</p> <p>For me, politics has always been about public service in the national interest. It is simple to say but often hard to do.</p> <p>But one of the things that sustains you in this job is the sense that, yes, our politics is full of argument and debate, and it can get quite heated, but no matter how difficult the decisions are, there is a great sense of British fair play, a quiet but prevailing sense that most people wish their prime minister well and want them to stick at it and get on with the job.</p> <p>So I want to take this moment to say thank you to all those who have written letters and emails offering me that support, people who I will never get to meet and never get to thank personally.</p> <p>It has been the greatest honour of my life to serve our country as prime minister over these last six years, and to serve as leader of my party for almost 11 years.</p> <p>And as we leave for the last time, my only wish is continued success for this great country that I love so very much.</p> </blockquote>       <figure class=\"element element-video\"

He is able to come across to people, talk to people. He\u2019s got the same ideas as Jeremy Corbyn, he\u2019s a Corbyn admirer to be honest. But Jeremy doesn\u2019t seem to be able to connect with people. I know he\u2019s got tremendous backing from certain members, but I think Owen would be a far more presentable leader. He is able to put his points over well.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Jayne Brencher</strong>, a Pontypridd Labour town councillor, said Smith would be a \u201cunifying force\u201d. She said: \u201cThere\u2019s a great support for Owen within the constituency. He\u2019s an excellent constituency MP and he would be a very able leader and a unifying force. He represents the moderate left. He has a great deal of support from Labour party voters. He\u2019s not part of any plot. He genuinely is a man of the people and for the people.\u201d</p> <p>Brencher argued that Pontypridd, a former coal and iron town, desperately needed a Labour government that would stick up for the most vulnerable. \u201cThere are people with great needs in our community,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we need is a Labour government. Whoever is able to deliver that is the one that we need to lead our party. In my view we need a unifier.\u201d</p> <p>The Labour leader of the town council, <strong>Mary Harvey</strong>, was not sure what stance to take. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to think. Everything seems to be in such a jumble. It\u2019s a bit of a mess.

It is because they cannot tolerate a socialist as the Labour party leader and [leader] of a socialist administration.</p> <p>Our objective is to transform our society into one that is fairer, more equal, more democratic, based upon, yes, a sustainably economically and environmentally prosperous society but where that prosperity is shared by all.

But, whereas Blair\u2019s (see <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/jul/13/pmqs-cameron-may-reshuffle-labour-leadership-bid-as-mcdonnell-defends-claim-that-anti-corbyn-plotters-fucking-useless-politics-live?page=with:block-57861b6be4b0fe16cc71a2e5#block-57861b6be4b0fe16cc71a2e5\">11.51am)</a> is a lovely piece of writing that stands the test of time, Cameron\u2019s comments (see <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/jul/13/pmqs-cameron-may-reshuffle-labour-leadership-bid-as-mcdonnell-defends-claim-that-anti-corbyn-plotters-fucking-useless-politics-live?page=with:block-57862863e4b00a75ba298be9#block-57862863e4b00a75ba298be9\">12.46pm) </a>were relatively trite. Perhaps he has something a bit more high-powered prepared for the statement he is due to make outside No 10 later. Cameron\u2019s decision to end, self-deprecatingly, with the words he used about Blair at his first PMQs was quite neat. But the line about how \u201cnothing is really impossible if you put your mind to it\u201d sounded somewhat crass given that he is leaving office because he found that winning the EU referendum was impossible. Cameron reportedly has no regrets about holding the referendum because he thinks the Commons must ultimately submit to the will of the public. But given that this belief has ended his career, it would be interesting to hear him elaborate on it. </p> <p>Today was not a day for aggressive questioning and Jeremy Corbyn struck the right note. He made some pointed remarks about Cameron\u2019s record, but he did so without ratcheting up the political malice and his joke about Cameron\u2019s mum (see <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/jul/13/pmqs-cameron-may-reshuffle-labour-leadership-bid-as-mcdonnell-defends-claim-that-anti-corbyn-plotters-fucking-useless-politics-live?page=with:block-5786223be4b0df8a5a68a2e0#block-5786223be4b0df8a5a68a2e0\">12.17pm)</a> was rather good.

In theory he is challenging Jeremy Corbyn for the job but much of what he said seemed to be directed at Angela Eagle, the former shadow business secretary who launched her own bid on Sunday. In broad political terms Eagle and Smith are very similar, but Smith is triangulating - trying to differentiate himself from two opponents by placing himself politically in a space in the middle - and in the interview he successfully managed to make himself sound noticeably to the left of Eagle on at least four points (Corbyn, Iraq, leadership election rules, and loyalty.)</p> <p>Here are the key points.<br></p> <ul> <li><strong>Smith said that, although in January he was saying Jeremy Corbyn should stay as leader until 2020, he had changed his mind because of the \u201cdramatic collapse of faith and confidence\u201d in Corbyn over the last fortnight</strong>.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He said that Corbyn was not suited to be leader - while also praising him quite strongly.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Whilst Jeremy is a good man with great Labour values who has done a lot for this party and I think changed the debate in this country about our economy - he\u2019s been right about lots of things - but he is not a leader who can lead us into an election and win for Labour.</p> </blockquote> <p>In many respects Smith and Eagle are making similar pitches for the leadership; they are both committed to carrying on with Corbyn\u2019s anti-austerity politics, but they are both arguing that Corbyn lacks the leadership qualities needed to ensure Labour wins. But Smith seemed to be going out of his way this morning to praise Corbyn\u2019s other qualities. Eagle has been noticeably less positive about him.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Smith criticised McDonnell for what he said last night about Labour plotters being \u201cfucking useless\u201d.</strong> Smith said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>That\u2019s not language he should be using as shadow chancellor, it\u2019s certainly not language I would be using.</p> </blockquote> <p>He also described McDonnell as \u201cpart of the problem\u201d facing Labour.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The truth is John McDonnell is part of the problem we have in the Labour party.</p> <p>I want this to be resolved without a damaging, divisive leadership contest. I wanted Jeremy Corbyn to find a way to heal the Labour party, to bring us back and unite us.</p> <p>I\u2019ve put that to him on three occasions, but to John McDonnell I said I feared he had decided that people on his part of the party wanted to split the Labour party and he said to me, he shrugged his shoulders and said \u2018if that\u2019s what it takes\u2019. I am not prepared to stand by and let the Labour party, the party I love, that has been the greatest force for good in this country, split \u2013 it cannot happen.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Smith said he was opposed to the Iraq war.</strong> This is the most important point on which he has been able to differentiate himself between from Eagle. Eagle was an MP at the time and in 2003 she obeyed the Labour whip and voted for the war, although she says she now regrets that vote. Smith was a Labour special adviser at the time and says he was opposed to the war, although he did not give up his job as an aide to Paul Murphy, the then Northern Ireland secretary.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He said that he was pleased that Labour\u2019s national executive committee decided to ensure that Corbyn would be on the ballot in the leadership contest. </strong>This marks another contrast with Eagle, who said that she thought Labour rules meant Corbyn should not be allowed on the ballot without being nominated by 51 MPs and MEPs (although Eagle accepted this was a decision for the NEC.)</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong> Smith said he would support Corbyn if he won the leadership.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I will stand in this election and I will do the decent thing and fight <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn\">Jeremy Corbyn</a> on the issues, just as he will do with me, and at the end of that I will stand behind whoever the leader is. But I hope and I expect it will be me.</p> </blockquote> <p>This is another act of Eagle differentiation. In interviews at the weekend Eagle sidestepped questions about whether she would serve in Corbyn\u2019s shadow cabinet if Corbyn won, saying she expected to win herself.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Smith said that he had not been involved in plotting against Corbyn.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I refused to have any part in discussions, which have been destructive, from a small group of people on the right who, just like those on the left, it seems to me, are now prepared to let Labour split.</p> </blockquote> <p>He also stressed that he had put some proposals to Corbyn about how he could resolve the leadership crisis, but that Corbyn had not accepted them. It was not clear if he was implying that Eagle was part of the \u201cdestructive\u201d anti-Corbyn clique or not.</p> <ul> <li><strong>He accepted that Eagle was better known than he was, but he said she had been in parliament for 25 years, and that he had only been an MP for six years.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He said he was not planning to vote in favour of the proposed amendment saying Tony Blair was in contempt of parliament because he misled MPs over Iraq. </strong>At the weekend Eagle indicated that she was also opposed to the amendment.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He said he was in favour of retaining the nuclear deterrent.</strong> But he used to be a member of CND, he said. Eagle is also in favour of maintaining the nuclear deterrent.</li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BBCr4today/status/753157997325643776\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">What does Labour hopeful Owen Smith think about Iraq, Trident and a Labour split? <a href=\"https://t.co/BFSn1zPEOv\">https://t.co/BFSn1zPEOv</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/R4Today?src=hash\">#R4Today</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/NSAf3Go7Ey\">pic.twitter.com/NSAf3Go7Ey</a></p>&mdash; BBC Radio 4 Today (@BBCr4today) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCr4today/status/753157997325643776\">July 13, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-578602e2e4b058a20001384e\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/tomphillips\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-07-13T09:07:24.591Z\">10.07am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Juncker says he will not negotiate Brexit with UK 'in a hostile mood'</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Jean-Claude Juncker,</strong> the president of the European commission, is on a visit to China where my colleague Tom Phillips has been speaking to him.

          "bodyText": "That\u2019s about it from our politics live blog on what was yet another historic day in Westminster. Thanks for reading. Bit of a kick for the former chancellor from Jonathan Portes, principal research fellow at the National Institute for Economic and Social Research: The German government says the chancellor, Angela Merkel, has congratulated Theresa May on becoming prime minister. Merkel\u2019s spokesman Steffen Seibert said that the German leader wished May luck in her new job in a phone conversation on Wednesday night. He said Merkel and May \u201cagreed that cooperation in the spirit of the proven friendly relations between both countries should be continued, including in the forthcoming negotiations on Britain\u2019s exit from the EU\u201d. US State Department spokesman Mark Toner says the US is looking forward to engaging with Boris Johnson, the new foreign secretary. He said that the bond between Britain and the US \u201cis frankly a relationship that goes beyond personalities\u201d, adding: \u201cWe\u2019re always going to be able to work with the British no matter who is occupying the role of foreign sec because of our deep abiding special relationship with the United Kingdom.\u201d Toner also congratulated Philip Hammond, the outgoing foreign secretary, on his new role as chancellor. \u201cIt is an absolutely critical moment in certainly England\u2019s history, but also in the US-UK relationship, so absolutely we\u2019re committed to working productively going forward.\u201d Sometimes merely describing an event just doesn\u2019t do it justice: Amber Rudd has become the fifth woman to hold one of the four great offices of state in the history of British politics. Theresa May appointed the former energy secretary to take on her former role of home secretary. There has never been a female chancellor, but these are the women who have held the other three major roles: Margaret Thatcher was Britain\u2019s first female prime minister when she entered Number 10 in 1979. Margaret Beckett became foreign secretary under Tony Blair\u2019s government in 2006. The former environment secretary was the first woman to hold the position. Jacqui Smith was the first female home secretary when she took office in 2007 in Gordon Brown\u2019s cabinet reshuffle. Theresa May is Britain\u2019s second female prime minister. May started her career at the Bank of England and became an MP in 1997. Amber Rudd became the third woman to hold the post of home secretary when May appointed her to the cabinet on Wednesday. She worked in the banking sector and recruitment before becoming MP for Hastings and Rye in 2010. Boris Johnson has said he is \u201cvery excited\u201d about returning to frontline politics as foreign secretary and that he was \u201cobviously very, very humbled, very, very proud to be offered this chance\u201d. I think Theresa made a wonderful speech this afternoon about her ambitions for the country and how she saw the Conservative government taking Britain forward. I completely agree with her sentiments and about opportunity, about giving people better life chances. Clearly now we have a massive opportunity in this country to make a great success of our relationship with Europe and with the world and I\u2019m very excited to be asked to play a part in that.\u201d Deputy editor Paul Johnson tweets the front page of Thursday\u2019s Guardian: And here\u2019s the Mirror\u2019s view on the day\u2019s events: Germany-based journalist Laura Schneider tweets: Lots of theories about tonights\u2019s cabinet appointments along the line of this tweet from Times columnist Hugo Rifkind: For this week\u2019s Guardian politics podcast, Anushka Asthana is joined by Heather Stewart, Toby Helm and Rajeev Syal on a momentous week at Westminster. We hear from the MPs closest to Theresa May on what her government will look like, Stewart Wood describes what it\u2019s like to be inside Number 10 on the last day of an administration. And as Labour embarks on a new leadership contest, we hear from the two challengers: Owen Smith and Angela Eagle. Listen here: Who knew news of Boris Johnson\u2019s new job had made it across the pond already? Well, it has, and Cher has let the world know just how she feels. (Nice use of emojis too by the ageless pop star, I\u2019m sure you will agree...) With perhaps less than ideal timing, Angela Eagle made a speech to Labour women earlier this evening, where a quip about Boris Johnson suddenly sounded a lot more serious. The Labour leadership candidate brought up her referendum debate performance, where she told Johnson to stop using the \u00a3350m figure. \u201cOh Boris, isn\u2019t he great for just bouncing around,\u201d she joked. A cry went up from the audience: \u201cHe\u2019s the foreign secretary!\u201d Eagle laughed initially, but then looked thunderstruck. \u201cBoris?!\u201d she exclaimed, then temporarily lost for words. There was uproar in the room, Labour MPs turned to each other, \u201care you serious?!\u201d one shouted. Eagle finally regained her composure: \u201cAll I can say is never ever say that having a Labour government elected isn\u2019t important.\u201d Here are some thoughts on the reshuffle so far. 1 - May has honoured her promise to put Brexiteers in charge of Brexit. During her campaign she said this was important because peope who voted leave would want to know that Brexit really did mean Brexit, but an alternative reading would be that she is applying Colin Powell\u2019s Pottery Barn \u2018You break it, you own it\u2019 rule. Boris Johnson, the new foreign secretary, David Davis, the new Brexit secretary and Liam Fox, the new international trade secretary, will be in charge of making Brexit work. 2 - Johnson\u2019s appointment represents a glittering promotion for him - but perhaps a demotion for the Foreign Office. Superficially it is an odd appointment, because it won\u2019t take long to compile quite a long list of countries and foreign leaders Johnson has offended in the past, but he likes to be liked and he may forge good relations with his counterparts. But the new arrangements also suggest the Foreign Office is being downsized. It used to be in charge of aid, but under Labour it lost that to DfID. Now it is losing Brexit (to Davis\u2019s department) and international trade (to Fox\u2019s department). What\u2019s left for Johnson? Handing out the Ferrero Rocher? On the subject of Johnson, the Foreign Office permanent secretary Simon McDonald has tweeted this. He has an odd idea of \u201cvery happy\u201d. 3 - It\u2019s a good reshuffle for retreads. Davis was last in government in 1997, and Fox in 2011, but May has brought them both back. Other former ministers may be hoping for a comeback tomorrow. 4 - But it does not seem to be quite as good for women as some of the overnight briefing suggested. We were told women would get top jobs, but May has only appointed one woman tonight. 5 - May has broken up the Cameron/Osborne clique. George Osborne is the only figure so far we know to have been sacked, and it is hard to think May thought he would have been a worse foreign secretary than Johnson. Perhaps she holds some grudge against him. It may take a while before we learn the full story of his departure, but it means that the two figures who ran Tory politics for the past 11 years have now gone. 6 - May clearly doesn\u2019t rate Andrea Leadsom as a top talent. (Which isn\u2019t suprising - few other people do.) 7 - Michael Gove can be seen as a loser - because while three other leading Brexiteers have been promoted, he hasn\u2019t, or at least he hasn\u2019t so far. There is a good chance May will keep him as justice secretary. 8 - Running Theresa May\u2019s campaign has, contrary to expectations, failed to put Chris Grayling, the leader of the Commons, into a top job. Grayling has been telling interviewers all day that he did not back May because he expected promotion. But that did not stop people thinking he might get one. So far it hasn\u2019t arrived, althought it is still possible he might get a cabinet upgrade tomorrow. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. My colleague Chris Johnston is taking over now. Spare a thought for poor Palmerston. His new guvnor is Boris Johnson ... This is from my colleague Peter Walker. Liam Fox has been made international trade secretary (a new post.) Number 10 said: The Queen has been pleased to approve the appointment of Rt Hon Liam Fox MP as Secretary of State for International Trade. And it looks as though that is the last appointment for the night. I will post a snap analysis shortly. This, from Tim Bale, a politics professor, is interesting on Boris Johnson. David Davis has been made Brexit secretary. The Queen has been pleased to approve the appointment of Rt Hon David Davis MP as Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union. Here is some reaction to Boris Johnson\u2019s appointment as foreign secretary from political journalists and commentators on Twitter. From the FT\u2019s Lionel Barber From the Guardian\u2019s Gaby Hinsliff From Newsnight\u2019s Emily Maitlis From the Times\u2019s David Byers From Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge From Raymond Snoody From the Economist\u2019s Jeremy Cliffe David Davis is going to be the Brexit minister, Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby reports. This is from the Telegraph\u2019s Michael Wilkinson. George Osborne was sacked, the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn reports. He was not offered an alternative post. Here are the cabinet appointments so far. (I will update this list as we go along, but you may need to refresh the page to get the updates to appear.) Theresa May - Prime minister Philip Hammond - Chancellor Boris Johnson - Foreign secretary Amber Rudd - Home secretary Michael Fallon - Defence secretary David Davis - Brexit secretary Liam Fox - International trade secretary Michael Fallon remains as defence secretary, No 10 has confirmed. Liam Fox, the former defence secretary, is arriving at No 10. David Davis has just been seen going into No 10 (which suggests the earlier tweet saying he was already in was wrong). Given that we already have a chancellor, a foreign secretary and a home secretary, Davis may well become the \u201cBrexit minister\u201d. Amber Rudd has been made home secretary. The Queen has been pleased to approve the appointment of Rt Hon Amber Rudd MP as Secretary of State for the Home Department. George Osborne has just tweeted about David Cameron\u2019s departure - but not about his own. Here is Boris Johnson arriving at the Foreign Office. The announcement has just arrived from No 10. The Queen has been pleased to approve the appointment of Boris Johnson MP as Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs. Further ministerial appointments will be announced this evening. Boris Johnson has just left Number 10 without making any comment. (He did not look particularly cheerful.) Boris Johnson has been made foreign secretary, the BBC reports. Philip Hammond, the new chancellor, has arrived at the Treasury. Jeremy Clarkson has been tweeting on the reshuffle. Michael Fallon, the defence secretary, has arrived at Number 10. David Davis, who has not sat on the frontbench since he resigned as shadow home secretary in 2008 to fight a byelection protesting against Labour\u2019s plans to extend pre-charge detention, is reportedly in No 10. ITV\u2019s Robert Peston thinks Davis could be \u201cminister for Brexit\u201d. Here are some leaders offering Theresa May their congratulations. From the White House From Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minster From Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European commission From Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister Amber Rudd, the energy secretary, has arrived at No 10. Here is the first press release from No 10. The Queen has been pleased to approve the appointment of Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP as Chancellor of the Exchequer. The Rt Hon George Osborne MP has resigned from Government. Further ministerial appointments will be announced this evening. This is from Sky\u2019s Faisal Islam. And this is from my colleague Patrick Wintour, the Guardian\u2019s diplomatic editor. Boris Johnson has arrived at No 10. That\u2019s unexpected. We have been told that we\u2019re getting the big jobs tonight \u2013 chancellor, foreign secretary, home secretary and secretary of state for Brexit (the new job Theresa May is creating) \u2013 and Johnson has not been tipped for any of these. Here are pictures of Theresa May arriving in No 10. Tom Watson, Labour\u2019s deputy leader, has put out this statement responding to Theresa May\u2019s appointment as prime minister. I congratulate Theresa May on becoming prime minister. To serve our country in this role is a privilege and an honour. These are challenging times for Britain. The decision to leave the European Union has created enormous economic uncertainty and insecurity. The priority for the new prime minister must be to ensure the country is best placed to deal with the challenges ahead. We\u2019ve today had warm words from our new prime minister about the need to stand up for more than a \u2018privileged few\u2019. The sentiments are good ones, but just like her predecessor the rhetoric is much better than the reality. The truth is Theresa May has been at the heart of the Tory government for the last six years and is tied to its record. It\u2019s a record of failing to stand up for working people and backing policies that are putting vital public services like the NHS at risk. The Labour party will continue to hold this failing government to account and push for a fairer alternative \u2013 that is what the country deserves. Philip Hammond, the foreign secretary, has just gone into No 10. He is being tipped to emerge as chancellor. Here is some reaction to Theresa May\u2019s speech from the political journalists and commentators on Twitter. Generally, it is pretty positive. From the Times\u2019s Tim Montgomerie From the Guardian\u2019s Patrick Wintour From the Economist\u2019s Jeremy Cliffe From the Observer\u2019s Nick Cohen From the Guardian\u2019s Polly Toynbee From the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth From the Guardian\u2019s Paul Johnson From the Spectator\u2019s Fraser Nelson From the Daily Mirror\u2019s Kevin Maguire From the New Statesman\u2019s Stephen Bush From the Guardian\u2019s Alan Travis From ITV\u2019s Julie Etchingham From the New Statesman\u2019s George Eaton From the Telegraph\u2019s Kate McCann Theresa May has already encountered her first protest as MP. Pro-Brexit campaigners were outside No 10 waiting for her. Theresa May has already upset the press \u2013 or at least certain elements of it \u2013 according to 5 News\u2019s Andy Bell. Here is the full text of Theresa May\u2019s speech outside No 10. I have just been to Buckingham Palace where Her Majesty the Queen has asked me to form a new government and I accepted. In David Cameron I follow in the footsteps of a great modern prime minister. Under David\u2019s leadership the government stabilised the economy, reduced the budget deficit and helped more people into work than ever before. But David\u2019s true legacy is not about the economy but about social justice. From the introduction of same-sex marriage to taking people on low wages out of income tax altogether, David Cameron has led a one-nation government and it is in that spirit that I also plan to lead. Because not everybody knows this but the full title of my party is the Conservative and Unionist party and that word unionist is very important to me. It means we believe in the union, the precious, precious bond between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland \u2013 but it means something else that is just as important. It means we believe in a union not just between the nations of the United Kingdom but between all of our citizens \u2013 every one of us \u2013 whoever we are and wherever we\u2019re from. That means fighting against the burning injustice that if you\u2019re born poor you will die on average nine years earlier than others. If you\u2019re black you are treated more harshly by the criminal justice system than if you\u2019re white. If you\u2019re a white working-class boy you\u2019re less likely than anybody else in Britain to go to university. If you\u2019re at a state school you\u2019re less likely to reach the top professions than if you\u2019re educated privately. If you\u2019re a woman you will earn less than a man. If you suffer from mental health problems, there\u2019s not enough help to hand. If you\u2019re young you will find it harder than ever before to own your own home. But the mission to make Britain a country that works for everyone means more than fighting these injustices. If you\u2019re from an ordinary working-class family, life is much harder than many people in Westminster realise. You have a job, but you don\u2019t always have job security. You have your own home, but you worry about paying the mortgage. You can just about manage, but you worry about the cost of living and getting your kids into a good school. If you are one of those families, if you\u2019re just managing, I want to address you directly. I know you are working around the clock, I know you\u2019re doing your best and I know that sometimes life can be a struggle. The government I lead will be driven, not by the interests of the privileged few but by yours. We will do everything we can to give you more control over your lives. When we take the big calls, we will think not of the powerful but you. When we pass new laws, we will listen not to the mighty but to you. When it comes to taxes, we will prioritise not the wealthy but you. When it comes to opportunity, we won\u2019t entrench the advantages of the fortunate few, we will do everything we can to help anybody, whatever your background, to go as far as your talents will take you. We are living through an important moment in our country\u2019s history. Following the referendum, we face a time of great national change. And I know because we\u2019re Great Britain we will rise to the challenge. As we leave the European Union, we will forge a bold new positive role for ourselves in the world and we will make Britain a country that works not for a privileged few but for every one of us. That will be the mission of the government I lead and together we will build a better Britain. Here is the key extract from Theresa May\u2019s speech. She committed herself to leading a one-nation government. Effectively, she was redefining the name of the Conservative party. Officially it is the Conservative and Unionist party. The \u201cunionist\u201d refers to the UK (normally thought of now primarily in terms of England/Scotland, but originally it referred to the union of Britain and Ireland). But May insisted it should also refer to the union of rich and poor. It was an interesting piece of creative interpretation, because in the past others have not read it like this. She said: In David Cameron I follow in the footsteps of a great modern prime minister. Under David\u2019s leadership the government stabilised the economy, reduced the budget deficit and helped more people into work than ever before. But David\u2019s true legacy is not about the economy but about social justice. From the introduction of same-sex marriage to taking people on low wages out of income tax altogether, David Cameron has led a one-nation government and it is in that spirit that I also plan to lead. Because not everybody knows this, but the full title of my party is the Conservative and Unionist party. And that word, unionist, is very important to me. It means we believe in the union, the precious, precious bond between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. But it means something else that is just as important. It means we believe in a union not just between the nations of the United Kingdom but between all of our citizens \u2013 every one of us \u2013 whoever we are and wherever we\u2019re from. After posing for photographs with her husband, Philip, on the steps of Downing Street, she heads into No 10, where the staff will be lining up to greet her. Theresa May says the Queen has asked her to form a government and she has accepted. David Cameron was a great modern prime minister, she says. He stabilised the economy. But his great legacy was social justice. He led a one-nation government. And that is how she intends to lead. The full title of her party is the Conservative and Unionist party. That word is important to her, she says. It means the union of the UK. But it also refers to the union of all our citizens, whoever they are. That means fighting against social injustice, she says. She is using a passage very similar to this one in her speech on Monday. Right now, if you\u2019re born poor, you will die on average nine years earlier than others. If you\u2019re black, you\u2019re treated more harshly by the criminal justice system than if you\u2019re white. If you\u2019re a white, working-class boy, you\u2019re less likely than anybody else to go to university. If you\u2019re at a state school, you\u2019re less likely to reach the top professions than if you\u2019re educated privately. If you\u2019re a woman, you still earn less than a man. If you suffer from mental health problems, there\u2019s too often not enough help to hand. If you\u2019re young, you\u2019ll find it harder than ever before to own your own home. But, as I have said before, fighting these injustices is not enough. If you\u2019re from a working-class family, life is just much harder than many people in politics realise. You have a job, but you don\u2019t always have job security. You have your own home, but you worry about mortgage rates going up. You can just about manage, but you worry about the cost of living and the quality of the local school, because there\u2019s no other choice for you. She says the government she leads will not be driven by the interests of the privileged few. She will try to give people more control, she says. And when she has to make the big calls, she will think what is in the interests of ordinary people. She says she wants Britain to work, not just for the privileged few, but for everyone. Here is the statement from the Palace. Theresa May is leaving Buckingham Palace. Here is another picture of Theresa May, now the new prime minister, with the Queen. Theresa May is formally appointed Britain\u2019s prime minister at Buckingham Palace by the Queen. Most of us don\u2019t get the chance to write our own obituaries, but in a sense that is what Cameron was doing from the podium outside No 10, in a speech (see 5.08pm) that combined a brief resume of what he considers his achievements with a nice tribute to his staff and his family and a little homily on the \u201cspirit of service\u201d. It was not a particularly remarkable speech, but it was noteworthy what he chose to stress: the economy (employment, lower taxes, the \u201cnational living wage\u201d etc) and progressive, social justice measures (like increasing the aid budget, adoption reform and the national citizen service). There was not anything very party political in it (unsurprisingly) and there was only a brief reference to the issue that brought about his resignation, the EU referendum and Brexit. Cameron fought the 2010 general election committed to creating the Big Society but over the next few years this was abandoned as a priority, partly because of austerity and partly because it turned out to be a vision with little electoral appeal. Cameron, though, never entirely gave up his belief in this vision and, although this speech did not contain what was once his catchphrase, it did end with a passage praising volunteers for \u201cmaking our society bigger and stronger\u201d and insisting that \u201cthe spirit of service is one of this country\u2019s most remarkable qualities\u201d. It sounded like the last gasp of the Big Society. Buckingham Palace has announced that David Cameron has resigned. Theresa May is now leaving the Commons and heading for Buckingham Palace. (For the next few minutes, no one is running the country.) Here is the full text of David Cameron\u2019s statement outside No 10. Good afternoon. When I first stood here in Downing Street on that evening in May 2010, I said we would confront our problems as a country and lead people through difficult decisions so that together we could reach better times. It\u2019s not been an easy journey and of course we have not got every decision right, but I do believe that today our country is much stronger. Above all it was about turning around the economy and with the deficit cut by two-thirds, two and a half million more people in work and 1m more businesses, there can be no doubt that our economy is immeasurably stronger. Politicians like to talk about policies but in the end it is about people\u2019s lives. I think of the people doing jobs who were previously unemployed. I think of the businesses that were just ideas in someone\u2019s head and that today are making a go of it and providing people with livelihoods. I think of the hardworking families paying lower taxes and getting higher wages because of the first ever national living wage. I think of the children who were languishing in the care system, and who have now been adopted by loving families. I think of the parents now able to send their children to good and outstanding schools, including free schools that simply didn\u2019t exist before. I think of over 200,000 young people who have taken part in national citizen service, the fastest growing youth programme of its kind in the world, something that again wasn\u2019t there six years ago. I think of the couples who have been able to get married who weren\u2019t allowed to in the past. And I think of the people on the other side of the world who wouldn\u2019t have had clean drinking water, the chance to go to school or even be alive were it not for our decision to keep our aid promises to the poorest people and the poorest countries in our world. And we have used our stronger economy to invest in our health service. When I walked in there, there were 18,000 people waiting over a year for their operation. Today it\u2019s just 800 \u2013 too many, still too long but our NHS is a national treasure and one whose staff perform miracles as I\u2019ve seen every day. And we\u2019ve strengthened our nation\u2019s defences, with submarines, destroyers and frigates, and, soon, aircraft carriers rolling out of our shipyards to keep our country safe in a dangerous world. These are the choices and the changes that we have made. And I want to thank everyone who has given so much to support me personally over these years. The incredible team in No 10, the civil servants, whose professionalism and impartiality is one of our country\u2019s greatest strengths. And my political advisers, some of whom have been with me since the day I stood for my party\u2019s leadership 11 years ago. I want to thank my children, Nancy, Elwen and Florence, for whom Downing Street has been a lovely home over these last six years. They sometimes kick the red boxes full of work. Florence \u2013 you once climbed into one, before a foreign trip, and said take me with you. No more boxes. And above all, I want to thank Samantha, the love of my life. You have kept me vaguely sane and, as well as being an amazing wife, mother and businesswoman, you have done something every week in that building behind me to celebrate the best spirit of voluntary service in our country. We will shortly be heading to Buckingham Palace to see Her Majesty the Queen, where I will tender my resignation as prime minister and I will advise Her Majesty to invite Theresa May to form a new administration. I am delighted that for the second time in British history the new prime minister will be a woman \u2013 and once again a Conservative. I believe Theresa will provide strong and stable leadership in fulfilling the Conservative manifesto on which we were elected, and I wish her well in negotiating the best possible terms for Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union. Let me finish by saying this. The spirit of service is one of this country\u2019s most remarkable qualities. I have seen that service day in and day out in the incredible work of our armed forces, our intelligence agencies and our police. It is something I always knew. But as prime minister you see it so directly that it blows you away. And of course writing those heart-breaking letters to the families who have lost loved ones is a poignant reminder of the profound scale of what these men and women give for us in the defence of our freedoms and our way of life. We must never forget that. In a different way, I have seen that same spirit of service in the amazing contributions of countless volunteers in communities up and down our country who are making our society bigger and stronger. And I am proud that every day for the past two years I have used the office of prime minister in a non-political way to recognise and thank almost 600 of them as Points of Light whose service can be an inspiration to us all. For me, politics has always been about public service in the national interest. It is simple to say but often hard to do. But one of the things that sustains you in this job is the sense that, yes, our politics is full of argument and debate, and it can get quite heated, but no matter how difficult the decisions are, there is a great sense of British fair play, a quiet but prevailing sense that most people wish their prime minister well and want them to stick at it and get on with the job. So I want to take this moment to say thank you to all those who have written letters and emails offering me that support, people who I will never get to meet and never get to thank personally. It has been the greatest honour of my life to serve our country as prime minister over these last six years, and to serve as leader of my party for almost 11 years. And as we leave for the last time, my only wish is continued success for this great country that I love so very much. Sky\u2019s Faisal Islam says David Cameron has now resigned. Here are some more pictures from Cameron\u2019s speech. Cameron says he has strengthened the NHS, and the armed forces. He thanks those who have given him so much support, including the civil servants who have given him impartial advice, and his political staff. He wants to thank his wife and children. Florence once climbed into one of his red boxes before a trip abroad and said take me with you. He thanks his wife for her support and praises her charity work. He will soon go to Buckingham Palace to resign and to recommend that the Queen appoints Theresa May as prime minister. He says the spirit of service is remarkable. He has seen it in the armed forces, and in the work done by volunteers. He has used his Points of Light tweets to recognise hundreds of people who have done voluntary work. He says the British have a spirit of fair play. People have wished him well. He thanks people who have written to him. He says being PM has been the greatest honour of his life. His only wish is continuing success for the country, he says. That\u2019s it. He poses for photographs on the doorstep with his family. And then they all head for the cars taking them out of Downing Street. David Cameron is coming out now with his wife and children. He says he promised to lead the country to better times. It is \u201cmuch stronger\u201d, he says. Above all, it was about turning around the economy. It is \u201cimmeasurably stronger\u201d, he says. He says politics is about people\u2019s lives. People have jobs, and are paying lower taxes and getting higher wages. He thinks of children who have been adopted, and parents sending their children to good schools and excellent schools that did not exist. He thinks of those who have done national citizen service. And gay people who can marry. And people abroad who have benefited from international aid. David Cameron is due to speak outside No 10 shortly. Here is the Labour MP Graham Jones responding to the comments from Labour NEC member Johanna Baxter about how Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s opponents have been subject to intimidation. Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, has \u2013 somewhat prematurely \u2013 congratulated Theresa May on becoming prime minister. At PMQs David Cameron told a touching story about the gay marriage legislation he introduced. I\u2019ll never forget the day at No 10 when someone who works very close to the front door said to me, \u2018I\u2019m not that interested in politics, Mr Cameron, but because of something your lot have done, I\u2019m able to marry the person I love this week.\u2019 There are many amazing moments in this job, but that was one of my favourites. According to Pink News, Cameron omitted one detail from this story. A source close to the events told PinkNews that Mr Cameron might have airbrushed one detail from the story; the staffer\u2019s comments actually brought the prime minister to tears as he was heading out to a meeting. This is from the Economist\u2019s Jeremy Cliffe. Jeremy Corbyn has been speaking to the Unite conference in Brighton this afternoon. He\u2019s had three standing ovations. These are from the Morning Star\u2019s Conrad Landin. Nick Boles, the skills minister, has announced that he is leaving the government. In more reshuffle speculation, the Telegraph\u2019s Christopher Hope says George Osborne will be replaced as chancellor and will leave the government. At Westminster the resignations just keep coming. Jim Wallace is stepping down. Jim who? The Lib Dem leader in the Lords, of course. Former Welsh secretary and party grandee Peter Hain has praised Owen Smith, who is standing for the Labour leadership, saying he has deep roots within the Labour movement in south Wales. He\u2019s grounded in the Labour valleys, the sense of of the party and the country, which you don\u2019t often find in modern politicians. He\u2019s fresh, he wasn\u2019t a member of the last Labour government, he offers a credible evidence-based alternative to austerity. He\u2019s radical on equality and social justice issues. He didn\u2019t vote for the Iraq war, he wasn\u2019t in parliament at the time. Hain led the Labour campaign in the south Wales valleys for the remain camp ahead of the referendum. He said: Jeremy is not popular on the doorstep, he\u2019s a big negative especially among Labour working class voters. Every day Jeremy remains leaders is a boost for Ukip in Labour working class heartlands. This, from the BBC\u2019s Moscow correspondent Steve Rosenberg, reveals what the Russian papers are saying about Theresa May. Terry Hoppery, the chair of Pontypridd\u2019s constituency Labour party, received a 7am call from Owen Smith informing him that he would be running for the Labour leadership. \u201cI\u2019m 100% behind him,\u201d said Hoppery. \u201cI think he\u2019s got the charisma. He is able to come across to people, talk to people. He\u2019s got the same ideas as Jeremy Corbyn, he\u2019s a Corbyn admirer to be honest. But Jeremy doesn\u2019t seem to be able to connect with people. I know he\u2019s got tremendous backing from certain members, but I think Owen would be a far more presentable leader. He is able to put his points over well.\u201d Jayne Brencher, a Pontypridd Labour town councillor, said Smith would be a \u201cunifying force\u201d. She said: \u201cThere\u2019s a great support for Owen within the constituency. He\u2019s an excellent constituency MP and he would be a very able leader and a unifying force. He represents the moderate left. He has a great deal of support from Labour party voters. He\u2019s not part of any plot. He genuinely is a man of the people and for the people.\u201d Brencher argued that Pontypridd, a former coal and iron town, desperately needed a Labour government that would stick up for the most vulnerable. \u201cThere are people with great needs in our community,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we need is a Labour government. Whoever is able to deliver that is the one that we need to lead our party. In my view we need a unifier.\u201d The Labour leader of the town council, Mary Harvey, was not sure what stance to take. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to think. Everything seems to be in such a jumble. It\u2019s a bit of a mess. I\u2019ve been a party member since 1981 and I don\u2019t think any of us saw what is happening at the moment coming.\u201d Does she see Owen Smith as a party leader? \u201cI can\u2019t fault him personally. I think a lot of people will say if they\u2019re honest that he hasn\u2019t been around long enough.\u201d Here is ITV\u2019s Robert Peston with his latest Theresa May reshuffle speculation. Angela Eagle has pledged that her leadership campaign will \u201ckeep it comradely\u201d in her battle to unseat Jeremy Corbyn, calling on the Labour leader to also sign her promise to stop intimidation and abuse on both sides. The pledge includes a promise to take action against any aggressive behaviour by supporters, end pickets of MPs\u2019 offices or homes, and unite behind whoever wins the ballot \u201cto fight the Tories and the general election\u201d. Signing the pledge card in Victoria Gardens, London, Eagle said she wanted to send a message about the abuse faced across the party. We want this to be a discussion we can all be proud of, where there is no space whatsoever for the kind of bullying and intimidation we have seen recently. I hope all of the other candidates in this leadership election and their supporters will sign up to this pledge. Her challenger for the anti-Corbyn vote, Owen Smith, should sign the pledge too, Eagle said. Labour MP Stephen Kinnock, who was there to sign the pledge along with other prominent supporters like Emma Reynolds, Harriet Harman, Stephen Doughty and Caroline Flint, said the pledge to support whoever won the new contest did not mean anyone was promising to serve again on a Corbyn frontbench. He said: I think uniting means we continue to represent our constituents on behalf of the Labour party. I think it\u2019s right [not to split]. There\u2019s only one Labour party, I\u2019ve been a member since 1985. Kinnock said Eagle could beat Corbyn because of a shift in attitudes he had seen in the party\u2019s existing membership. With Smith announcing his candidacy this morning, Kinnock said he hoped he would reconsider. He said: I do think it would be better to have one anti-Corbyn candidate, I\u2019ll be very frank about that. I think over the coming days that should be considered very careful. But Angela\u2019s had the guts and the courage in this leadership contest, she stuck her neck out on Wednesday. We need to have a woman leader and we are prepared to put our money where our mouth is and do it. The \u201ccoup\u201d against Jeremy Corbyn was mounted because opponents of the Labour leader cannot tolerate a socialist as the head of the party and as the leader of a socialist administration, according to John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor. There\u2019s been a lot of interest in what he had to say at the rally where the shadow chancellor \u2013 speaking of Corbyn\u2019s opponents in the party \u2013 said that \u201cas plotters they\u2019re fucking useless\u201d. So here\u2019s more of what McDonnell said before he was joined on stage by the leader himself. We defeated the first wave of a coup against Jeremy Corbyn. We did it thanks \u2026 Because all of you created a climate of opinion which gave courage to our representatives on the NEC who voted 18 to 14 that Jeremy would be on the ballot. They [Corbyn\u2019s opponents] have been plotting and conniving. The only good thing about it is that as plotters they are fucking useless. Don\u2019t think they have stopped there. They will come back and they will try and hit us again, and we will defeat them again, won\u2019t we? [We start Jeremy\u2019s campaign for leadership of the Labour party] in 48 hours and we need your support throughout that campaign, throughout August and into September to maximise his vote, to give him a clear mandate. But finally let me say this: Why, why do you think this coup was tolerated? It is because they cannot tolerate a socialist as the Labour party leader and [leader] of a socialist administration. Our objective is to transform our society into one that is fairer, more equal, more democratic, based upon, yes, a sustainably economically and environmentally prosperous society but where that prosperity is shared by all. That is our intention. And we would not be here. It is not quite the Highland Clearances, but the Evening Standard\u2019s Joe Murphy and Nicholas Cecil report that four Welsh MPs have been evicted from St Stephen\u2019s Tower in the House of Commons to make way for David Cameron, who has been given a new office there. The Evening Standard had a peek into the office in the Palace of Westminster where he will start his new life as a backbench MP and discovered that it boasts a medieval-style stone staircase, oak panelling and painted ceilings. Staff were sprucing up the hastily emptied suite in St Stephen\u2019s Tower for its new occupant, cleaning a stain from the green carpet, after four Tory MPs were kicked out to make way for him. Crates with Mr Cameron\u2019s name on were stacked outside, while the names of three of his key staff were written on notes attached to some of the desks. The suite, which is 20ft wide and 24ft long, has commanding views of Westminster Abbey and the ancient Jewel House \u2013 part of the original Royal Palace. Until yesterday it was home to at least four Welsh MPs who, colleagues say, were given 24 hours\u2019 notice to move out. Presumably the Welsh MPs are being rehoused somewhere else on the parliamentary estate. Buzzfeed\u2019s Emily Ashton has named some of the Labour MPs who joined the Tories in giving David Cameron a standing ovation. David Cameron used his final prime minister\u2019s questions to praise his fellow MPs and roundly mock Jeremy Corbyn, suggesting his embattled opposite number was so ineffective a voter had urged him to do his best to keep the Labour leader in his job. Cameron received a standing ovation from Conservative MPs. Some Labour MPs and the Lib Dem former deputy prime minister also joined in the standing ovation. Cameron\u2019s wife, Samantha, and children, Nancy, Elwen and Florence, were in the public gallery. Cameron told MPs that Theresa May, his successor, should try to keep the UK \u201cas close to the European Union as possible\u201d. Cameron told MPs that every victim of the NHS contaminated blood scandal will for the first time receive a regular annual support payment. Owen Smith, the former shadow work and pensions secretary, has launched a challenge to Jeremy Corbyn for the Labour leadership. For more, see 11.06am. Angela Eagle is also standing, and the Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge has said she hopes the parliamentary Labour party chooses just one candidate to take on Corbyn. (See 9.22am.) Stephen Kinnock, another Labour MP, said the same to the BBC. He said: I genuinely hope we will only have one candidate to campaign against Jeremy. He said he hoped it would be Eagle. Eagle has made a promise to fight a clean campaign. Jeremy Corbyn tacitly endorsed bullying and intimidation of Labour staff by voting against the proposal for a secret ballot on Wednesday night, an NEC member has said. As Jessica Elgot reports, Johanna Baxter, who is a trade union official and represents constituency parties on Labour\u2019s national executive committee, said she generally avoided speaking to the press about Corbyn but called the NEC meeting \u201can utter disgrace to our movement\u201d. The departure of David Cameron has big implications for the Guardian\u2019s cartoonist, Steve Bell. In this video Bell talks about drawing him. Another removal van has been arriving at Downing Street today. This one was delivering for Theresa May. At PMQs David Cameron said that, contrary to some claims, he really did like Larry the Downing Street cat. (See 12.17pm.) He has tweeted this as proof. In the past Cameron has been a fairly poor user of social media but, if he is now tweeting pictures of cats, he is clearly getting the hang of it ... ITV\u2019s Robert Peston thinks Philip Hammond, the foreign secretary, will be appointed chancellor by Theresa May. Theresa May spent her final evening before becoming prime minister having dinner with the chief rabbi, the Press Association reports. May and her husband, Philip, joined guests at the north London home of Ephraim Mirvis for the dinner, which had been arranged some time ago. Afterwards, in a statement, Mirvis described May as \u201ca friend and champion of our community and of other faiths\u201d. He said: Today, Theresa May becomes prime minister at a time of great political, social and economic uncertainty. Few people are more talented or better qualified to tackle these immense challenges. I recall the speed and the sensitivity with which she reached out to the Jewish community following the terror attacks on Jewish targets in Europe last year. As she made clear then, \u2018Without its Jews, Britain would not be Britain.\u2019 She has proved herself to be a friend and champion of our community and of other faith communities who share her values of tolerance and understanding. Last night, on the eve of her becoming prime minister, Theresa May kept a longstanding arrangement to join Valerie and me at our home for dinner. The fact that she did this in the midst of critically important preparations before taking up office is a reflection of her strong desire to keep to her commitments and the esteem in which she holds the British Jewish community. I was delighted to have the opportunity to give her my blessings at this very auspicious time. I wish her every success as prime minister and look forward to building upon our warm relationship over the coming years. This picture shows people working in the Commons lining up to applaud David Cameron as he walked to his car after PMQs before being driven away. And here is the scene in No 10 where reporters are waiting to cover Cameron\u2019s departure later. David Cameron\u2019s final appearance at PMQs was dignified and good-humoured but not charged with the same emotion that Tony Blair\u2019s was nine years ago. Like Blair, Cameron chose to end with a little spiel expressing his faith in the House of Commons and in politics generally. But, whereas Blair\u2019s (see 11.51am) is a lovely piece of writing that stands the test of time, Cameron\u2019s comments (see 12.46pm) were relatively trite. Perhaps he has something a bit more high-powered prepared for the statement he is due to make outside No 10 later. Cameron\u2019s decision to end, self-deprecatingly, with the words he used about Blair at his first PMQs was quite neat. But the line about how \u201cnothing is really impossible if you put your mind to it\u201d sounded somewhat crass given that he is leaving office because he found that winning the EU referendum was impossible. Cameron reportedly has no regrets about holding the referendum because he thinks the Commons must ultimately submit to the will of the public. But given that this belief has ended his career, it would be interesting to hear him elaborate on it. Today was not a day for aggressive questioning and Jeremy Corbyn struck the right note. He made some pointed remarks about Cameron\u2019s record, but he did so without ratcheting up the political malice and his joke about Cameron\u2019s mum (see 12.17pm) was rather good. Cameron\u2019s jokes were suitably measured too. For those of you who don\u2019t know the Black Knight sketch, here it is. Cameron compared Corbyn to the Black Knight, who never gives up despite being chopped to pieces. It is hard now to see why people find the sketch funny but, compared to many of the other things Cameron has said about Corbyn, this barb was relatively complimentary. UPDATE: Thanks to the readers who have pointed out that the Black Knight sequence is not a sketch, but a scene from Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Here is Cameron\u2019s peroration. I will watch these exchanges from the backbenches. I will miss the roar of the crowd, I will miss the barbs from the opposition, but I will be willing you on. And when I say willing you on, I don\u2019t just mean willing on the new prime minister at this dispatch box, or indeed just willing on the frontbench defending the manifesto that I helped put together. But I mean willing all of you on, because people come here with huge passion for the issues they care about. They come here with great love for the constituencies that they represent. And also willing on this place. Because, yes, we can be pretty tough and test and challenge our leaders \u2013 perhaps more than some other countries \u2013 but that is something we should be proud of and we should keep at it, and I hope you will all keep at it, and I will will you on as you do. The last thing I would say is that you can achieve a lot of things in politics. You can get a lot of things done. And that in the end, the public service, the national interest, that is what it is all about. Nothing is really impossible if you put your mind to it. After all, as I once said, I was the future once. The Conservative Ken Clarke thanks Cameron for his leadership, but also for the wit and elegance he has brought to PMQs. He asks if Cameron will remain an active participant in the Commons. As no two people know what Brexit means, we need his advice. Cameron recalls trying to get Clarke to join the frontbench when he was on a birdwatching holiday in Patagonia. He says Clarke\u2019s first act as chancellor was to sack Cameron as a special adviser. He says he was pleased to bring him into government. Clarke was never easy to get hold of. Tory modernisation never got as far as getting him to have a mobile phone, he says. He says as a backbencher he will be willing the Commons on. And politics is about achieving things. Nothing is impossible if you put your mind to it. He gets a round of applause. Tory MPs give him a standing ovation. Opposition MPs are applauding too, but they have not got to their feet (apart from some Lib Dems). The SNP\u2019s Carol Monaghan asks about broken promises and the renewal of Trident. Cameron has done more for Scottish independence than many others, she says. So will he join the SNP? Cameron says Lord Smith himself said the vow to create a powerhouse parliament was kept. He has created a powerhouse parliament. But he has not seen the SNP use those powers. Robin Walker, a Conservative, says he became an MP when Cameron became PM. Since then unemployment in Worcester has halved. He thanks Cameron for his legacy. Cameron says there are 450,000 fewer children in households where no one works. That is particularly important. Labour\u2019s Adrian Bailey asks Cameron to impress on May the importance of retaining access to the single market. Cameron says he agrees with this. It is vital to have proper access to the single market, he says. Wendy Morton, a Conservative, praises Cameron for his firm focus on jobs, skills and investment. Cameron says he wants to improve apprenticeships so people can have a career. And when they get a job, he wants them to pay less tax. Labour\u2019s Graham Stringer thanks Cameron for the courteous way he responds to questions. But until he had an eye operation he could not see him well. Is Cameron concerned that people are jumping the queue for cataract operations? Cameron says he does not know the details of what Stringer is asking about. Steve Brine, a Conservative, says Cameron once said politicians were a mixture of egotism and altruism. Cameron has stayed on the right side of that divide, he says. Labour\u2019s Jeff Smith says Cameron came into power planning to get rid of the deficit and to stop his party banging on about Europe. How has that gone? Cameron defends his economic record, and says it was right to have an EU referendum. Cameron says he is able to announce today compensation to victims of the contaminated blood scandal. Angus Robertson, the SNP leader, offers Cameron his best wishes. But he says Cameron\u2019s legacy is to take Scotland to the brink of coming out of the EU. So SNP MPs will not be applauding him. What advice has he given May about this? Cameron says his advice to May, who is a \u201cbrilliant negotiator\u201d, is that we should try to be as close to the EU as we can be. Robertson says May is well known in Scotland because of the threat to deport the Brain family. And the first vote of her premiership will be on Trident, opposed by almost all Scottish MPs. How will this go down in Scotland? Cameron says the Brain family have an extension so they can apply for a work visa. He hopes that happens. He says there are many people in Scotland who support Trident. There are 143,000 more jobs in Scotland. Two big warships are being built in Scotland. There has been a decisive referendum. And a Scot has won Wimbledon twice under his premiership. Never mind Indy2. What about Andy2. Peter Lilley says Cameron has a mastery of the dispatch box that he has not seen anyone else achieve. People know Cameron is driven by a sense of duty, he says. They know he wants to make the UK more prosperous, more tolerant and more free. Cameron thanks Lilley. He says PMQs has a purpose. It means he has to find out what is going on around the world. People watch it around the world. He recalls being in New York when someone came up to him and said \u201cCameron, PMQs \u2013 we love your show.\u201d Corbyn says he has a question from Nina. Can an EU citizen who has lived in the UK for 30 years have their right to stay revoked. Cameron says there is no chance of that happening to someone in those circumstances. He says this might only happen if Britons in other countries did not have their rights respected He says he has got an email, too. He says he got an email from someone on 16 September 2015 telling him to be polite to Corbyn because Tom Watson was far more of a threat. He must find the sender to find out what happens next. Corbyn says he has asked Cameron 179 questions. He says he wants to wish Cameron well, and wish his family well, too. It is our loved ones who make all the difference. And he wishes to pass on to Cameron\u2019s mum his thanks for her advice about ties and songs. There is a rumour that Cameron\u2019s departure has been timed so he can slip into the vacancy created by Strictly Come Dancing\u2019s Len Goodman. Cameron says he has addressed 5,500 questions. He will leave it up to others to decide how many he has answered. And he has spent 92 hours answering statements. But he wishes to quash a rumour. He loves Larry the Downing Street cat, he says. Corbyn says May said in her speech on Monday that people feel the economy does not work for them. Isn\u2019t she right? Cameron says, if he wants to talk about the economy, the defict has been cut by two-thirds, there are 2.5 million more people in work, there are almost 1m more businesses and 2.9 million apprentices. And if Corbyn wants to talk about efficiency, the Tories have already finished their leadership contest. Labour has not even decided the rules, he says. Corbyn says democracy is a wonderful thing. He says May talked about unscrupulous bosses. He can\u2019t imagine who she was referring to. Will May clamp down on zero-hours contracts, and repeal the Trade Union Act? Cameron says the government introduced the \u201cnational minimum wage\u201d. And it banned exclusive zero-hours contracts. He says he is beginning to admire Corbyn\u2019s tenacity. He says Corbyn reminds him of the Black Knight in Monty Python. People keep kicking him, but he says keep going, saying it is only a flesh wound. Jeremy Corbyn starts by paying tribute to the British Wimbledon winners. He says it is right to thank Cameron for his service. He has often disagreed with him, but he pays tribute to him for securing the release of Shaker Aamer and for his gay marriage legislation, which was passed with Labour votes. And he asks about homelessness. Cameron says it is 10% below the peak it was under Labour. Corbyn says he has been listening to what Theresa May has been saying. She says it is harder than ever for young people to buy their first home. Why is that? Cameron says he wants to congratulate May on becoming prime minister. When it comes to women prime ministers, soon it will be 2-0 to the Conservatives. And not a pink bus in sight, he says. On housing, he says the issue of affordability is key. Help to buy and shared ownership mean some people can buy a home with a deposit of just \u00a32,000. Jack Lopresti, a Conservative, thanks Cameron for his hard work. And he asks about the Peshmerga, the Kurdish troops. Can the government do more to support them? Cameron says they are doing valuable work. He will look at the suggestion to give them more medical help. Daesh is on the back foot. It has lost 45% of the territory it held in Iraq. 25,000 of its troops have been killed, he says. Danny Kinahan, an Ulster Unionist, thanks Cameron for his contribution to Northern Ireland. And there are other leadership roles out there, he tells Cameron: the England football team, Top Gear, the US presidency. And he asks about Brexit. Cameron thanks Kinahan for his suggestions. Most of those jobs sound even harder than this one, he says. He says it is important to keep the benefits of the common travel area for Northern Ireland. David Cameron starts by congratulating Andy Murray and the other British Wimbledon winners. Normally he says at this point he has other meetings later today. But today he says that, other than one meeting with the Queen, his diary for the rest of the day is \u201cremarkably light\u201d. I normally do a snap Cameron/Corbyn verdict as soon as Corbyn has finished, but I sense that today is not really about the Cameron/Corbyn battle, and so I will post my verdict on PMQs as a whole when it is over. The Lib Dem MP Tom Brake is not feeling generous towards David Cameron on the day of his last PMQs. This is from the Tory MP Jesse Norman. Here is footage of the last moment of Tony Blair\u2019s final PMQs. And this is what Blair said. I have never pretended to be the greatest House of Commons man but I can pay the house the greatest compliment I can by saying that from the first until the last I have never stopped fearing it. The tingling apprehension I felt at three minutes to 12 today I felt as much 10 years ago and every bit as accute. It is in that fear that respect is retained. Some may belittle politics but we know it is where people stand tall. And although I know it has its many harsh contentions, it is still the arena which sets the heart beating fast. It may sometimes be a place of low skullduggery but it is more often a place for more noble causes. I wish everyone, friend or foe, well and that is that, the end. Blair received a standing ovation. At first, only the Labour MPs stood up. But then David Cameron, the then opposition leader, got to his feet and, with a vigorous wave of his arm, instructed Tory MPs to stand too \u2013 which they did. On that occasion, Blair was leaving the Commons, not just Downing Street. Cameron is staying as an MP at least until 2020, and so his departure is not quite as final as Blair\u2019s. But it will be interesting to see whether he gets a standing ovation, too, and whether Jeremy Corbyn joins in if he does. Here is David Cameron\u2019s first PMQs, on 7 December 2005. A prime minister\u2019s last day in No 10 is always very unusual. Stewart Wood, who worked for Gordon Brown, has written an interesting blog about what it was like in Downing Street on the day Brown quit. Here\u2019s an excerpt. The tenure of our prime ministers is bookended by two letters. The first is one with instructions to those in charge of our nuclear weapons, written as soon as they arrive in Downing Street; the last is one with good wishes for your successor written just as they leave. Gordon wrote three letters in those final hours \u2013 two to heroes that inspired him (Aung San Suu Kyi and Nelson Mandela) and one to David Cameron (accompanied by a bottle of something strong, as I remember). For all their rivalry, his letter to Cameron was warm and sincere, encouraging him never to forget what a privilege it is to be our nation\u2019s leader, and full of praise for the extraordinary professionalism of the staff at Downing Street. Here is David Cameron leaving No 10 early to drive to the Commons for PMQs. Manchester Gorton Labour party has been suspended following allegations relating to the conduct of members, the Press Association reports. It is understood the complaints centre around jostling within the constituency Labour party (CLP) ahead of Sir Gerald Kaufman\u2019s seat becoming available if the 86-year-old does not stand at the next election. No meetings of the CLP or any of its branches will now take place while an inquiry is undertaken. The Labour spokeswoman said: \u201cAny complaints of bullying or intimidation and allegations of misconduct are always taken very seriously by the Labour party.\u201d The Manchester Evening News reported that a letter sent from Labour\u2019s head office states that the allegations relate to the conduct of members \u201cboth during and outside of Labour party meetings\u201d as well as the \u201cconduct of members of the CLP executive committee in administering internal ballots\u201d. The letter also states that \u201cit is their understanding that conversations have taken place between the CLP and Greater Manchester police\u201d over safety fears. This morning, Owen Smith told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that he was opposed to the Iraq war. (See 11.06am.) Channel 4 News\u2019s Michael Crick has tweeted a link to this article from the WalesOnline in 2006 in which Smith, then a byelection candidate, said he did not know whether he would have voted against the Iraq war. Owen Smith, the former shadow work and pensions secretary, announced his bid for the Labour leadership on the Today programme this morning. In theory he is challenging Jeremy Corbyn for the job but much of what he said seemed to be directed at Angela Eagle, the former shadow business secretary who launched her own bid on Sunday. In broad political terms Eagle and Smith are very similar, but Smith is triangulating - trying to differentiate himself from two opponents by placing himself politically in a space in the middle - and in the interview he successfully managed to make himself sound noticeably to the left of Eagle on at least four points (Corbyn, Iraq, leadership election rules, and loyalty.) Here are the key points. Smith said that, although in January he was saying Jeremy Corbyn should stay as leader until 2020, he had changed his mind because of the \u201cdramatic collapse of faith and confidence\u201d in Corbyn over the last fortnight. He said that Corbyn was not suited to be leader - while also praising him quite strongly. Whilst Jeremy is a good man with great Labour values who has done a lot for this party and I think changed the debate in this country about our economy - he\u2019s been right about lots of things - but he is not a leader who can lead us into an election and win for Labour. In many respects Smith and Eagle are making similar pitches for the leadership; they are both committed to carrying on with Corbyn\u2019s anti-austerity politics, but they are both arguing that Corbyn lacks the leadership qualities needed to ensure Labour wins. But Smith seemed to be going out of his way this morning to praise Corbyn\u2019s other qualities. Eagle has been noticeably less positive about him. Smith criticised McDonnell for what he said last night about Labour plotters being \u201cfucking useless\u201d. Smith said: That\u2019s not language he should be using as shadow chancellor, it\u2019s certainly not language I would be using. He also described McDonnell as \u201cpart of the problem\u201d facing Labour. The truth is John McDonnell is part of the problem we have in the Labour party. I want this to be resolved without a damaging, divisive leadership contest. I wanted Jeremy Corbyn to find a way to heal the Labour party, to bring us back and unite us. I\u2019ve put that to him on three occasions, but to John McDonnell I said I feared he had decided that people on his part of the party wanted to split the Labour party and he said to me, he shrugged his shoulders and said \u2018if that\u2019s what it takes\u2019. I am not prepared to stand by and let the Labour party, the party I love, that has been the greatest force for good in this country, split \u2013 it cannot happen. Smith said he was opposed to the Iraq war. This is the most important point on which he has been able to differentiate himself between from Eagle. Eagle was an MP at the time and in 2003 she obeyed the Labour whip and voted for the war, although she says she now regrets that vote. Smith was a Labour special adviser at the time and says he was opposed to the war, although he did not give up his job as an aide to Paul Murphy, the then Northern Ireland secretary. He said that he was pleased that Labour\u2019s national executive committee decided to ensure that Corbyn would be on the ballot in the leadership contest. This marks another contrast with Eagle, who said that she thought Labour rules meant Corbyn should not be allowed on the ballot without being nominated by 51 MPs and MEPs (although Eagle accepted this was a decision for the NEC.) Smith said he would support Corbyn if he won the leadership. I will stand in this election and I will do the decent thing and fight Jeremy Corbyn on the issues, just as he will do with me, and at the end of that I will stand behind whoever the leader is. But I hope and I expect it will be me. This is another act of Eagle differentiation. In interviews at the weekend Eagle sidestepped questions about whether she would serve in Corbyn\u2019s shadow cabinet if Corbyn won, saying she expected to win herself. Smith said that he had not been involved in plotting against Corbyn. I refused to have any part in discussions, which have been destructive, from a small group of people on the right who, just like those on the left, it seems to me, are now prepared to let Labour split. He also stressed that he had put some proposals to Corbyn about how he could resolve the leadership crisis, but that Corbyn had not accepted them. It was not clear if he was implying that Eagle was part of the \u201cdestructive\u201d anti-Corbyn clique or not. He accepted that Eagle was better known than he was, but he said she had been in parliament for 25 years, and that he had only been an MP for six years. He said he was not planning to vote in favour of the proposed amendment saying Tony Blair was in contempt of parliament because he misled MPs over Iraq. At the weekend Eagle indicated that she was also opposed to the amendment. He said he was in favour of retaining the nuclear deterrent. But he used to be a member of CND, he said. Eagle is also in favour of maintaining the nuclear deterrent. Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, is on a visit to China where my colleague Tom Phillips has been speaking to him. Here are the key points. Juncker said that he wanted the EU\u2019s relationship with the UK to remain good. He said: I have to say that personally and institutionally, I want our relations with Britain to be as close as possible. I will not negotiate with Britain in a hostile mood ... We are partners in the European Union for 40 years now \u2026 There is no place for hatred, no place for revenge, no place for the contrary of friendship. This is rather different from the tone he adopted in May, when he said the UK would be treated as as \u201cdeserter\u201d if it left. He said he would not be giving advice to Theresa May. I am not giving public advice to the incoming British prime minister. I don\u2019t want to lecture her, I don\u2019t want to talk about her before having talked with her. I\u2019m envisaging this relationship as having the potential to become a good relationship. He reaffirmed his determination not to start Brexit talks until the UK invokes article 50, starting the two-year withdrawal process. He said: We have made it clear that before notification there will be no negotiation\u2026 [so] we are waiting for the notification and then we will engage in negotiations with our British friends. After Ruth Davidson\u2019s hugely successful stand-up session at yesterday\u2019s Westminster lobby lunch,today it is Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s turn to visit London. (There are no briefings yet about edgy Boris Johnson gags, but it\u2019s early in the day). Sturgeon has already had a breakfast meeting with Bank of England governor Mark Carney, where the pair were expected to discuss the economic outlook post-Brexit, and will later meet the chief minister of Gibraltar, Fabian Picardo. Sturgeon said: \u201c I am looking forward to exploring how we can work together to ensure that our interests are protected in the uncertain period that lies ahead.\u201d David Cameron has left Number 10 to go to the Commons for PMQs. Normally he does not leave Downing Street until about 11.45pm, but today\u2019s PMQs will be a valedictory one and he probably does not need to spend as much time brushing up on all the details of A&amp;E waiting times, or whatever, as usual. After PMQs he will visit the Palace to see the Queen to resign. And at some point he will make a speech outside Number 10 to mark his departure. McDonnell has just told BBC News that he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the NEC\u2019s decision to insist that Labour members can only vote in the leadership contest as members if they joined at least six months ago. (See 9.10am.) But he said he would accept the decision. He did not call for it to be reconsidered. This is what John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said about Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s opponents at a rally last night. They have been plotting and conniving. The only good thing about it, as plotters they\u2019re fucking useless. Speaking on the Today programme, McDonnell said he was being light-hearted. It was a stand-up comedy event. It was a joke. It was taken in a light-hearted way. He also insisted that he was not referring to Angela Eagle, who announced on Monday she was challenging Corbyn for the leadership, and that he was just referring to a small group in the party who had never reconciled themselves to Corbyn\u2019s leadership. McDonnell also insisted Corbyn was not to blame for the intimidation that some MPs opposed to him were facing. Corbyn was \u201cthe most caring, compassionate person I\u2019ve met in politics\u201d, he said. Corbyn himself had been a victim of intimidation, he said. \u201cThe levels of abuse he\u2019s suffered are a disgrace,\u201d McDonnell said. McDonnell accepted that the climate in which politics was being conducted at the moment was unpleasant. But he insisted that this was a general problem, not just facing Labour, as illustrated by the abuse immigrants have faced since the Brexit vote. \u201cThere\u2019s a political climate, unfortunately, that can be quite hostile,\u201d he said. Those responsible for the abuse were people outside politics, he said. Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair\u2019s communications chief and a fierce opponent of Corbyn and McDonnell, was not impressed by McDonnell\u2019s interview. Here\u2019s how he responded on Twitter. In her Today interview, Dame Margaret Hodge also said the parliamentary Labour party should select just one \u201cunity candidate\u201d to take on Jeremy Corbyn. At the moment there are two candidate vying for this job, Angela Eagle and Owen Smith. Under Hodge\u2019s plan, the PLP would hold a \u201cprimary\u201d to select their anti-Corbyn candidate. On the Today programme James Schneider, the Momentum spokesman, also insisted that Momentum was not responsible for the intimidation of MPs opposed to Jeremy Corbyn. He said the organisation had not received a single complaint about one of its members being involved in intimidation. But the Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge, who tabled the no confidence motion in Jeremy Corbyn, said Corbyn\u2019s supporters were responsible for the bullying of MPs. She saiod said \u201cpeople around Jeremy\u201d were indulging in \u201cdirty politics\u201d. This is not the new politics, it\u2019s the old politics I fought in the 1980s, when people like John McDonnell and Ken Livingstone were in leadership roles,\u201d she told Today. \u201cIt was a politics of intolerance, bullying and intimidation. These are people working in Jeremy\u2019s name, they are people around Jeremy. Far too many individuals, Members of Parliament and others are being intimidated, bullied, harassed, physically assaulted. Last night Labour\u2019s national executive committee decided that Jeremy Corbyn would be allowed to take part in the Labour leadership contest without having to get nominated by 51 MPs or MEPs, like his opponents. But it also decided that party members will not be able to vote in the contest as party members unless they joined more than six months ago. (Instead they will have to pay \u00a325 to become a registered supporter if they want to have a vote, but there will only be a two-day window during which they can apply.) On the Today programme this morning James Schneider, a spokesman for Momentum, the organisation for Corbyn supporters, said these rules were \u201cnot fair\u201d. He explained: We\u2019ve seen since the Brexit vote probably the largest surge in political party membership in this country\u2019s history, with almost 130,000 people joining the Labour party and a great number of those joined on the basis that they would be able to vote in a future leadership election. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow and I\u2019m blogging today. Owen Smith, the former shadow work and pensions secretary, has been on the Today programme to announce his bid for the Labour leadership. He told the programme: I will stand in this election and I will do the decent thing and fight Jeremy Corbyn on the issues, just as he will do with me, and at the end of that I will stand behind whoever the leader is. But I hope and I expect it will be me. I will have a full summary and analysis shortly. And John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has been on the Today programme defending his claim last night that those plotting against Jeremy Corbyn were \u201cfucking useless\u201d. On the programme it was put to him that his language was inconsistent with Corbyn\u2019s call for people in Labour to treat each other with respect (although a more generous interpretation would be that he was just being accurate). McDonnell insisted that he was just joking. I will post more on his interview too soon. Good morning and welcome to our daily politics live blog which Andrew Sparrow will be picking up here shortly The big picture So we\u2019re waiting for Theresa May, the incoming prime minister, to formally announce her first cabinet after moving into Downing Street with her husband, Philip. May will take up residence at No 10 after an audience at Buckingham Palace where the Queen will confirm her new role. Relief has meanwhile gives way to celebration for Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s inner circle as the Labour leader looks forward to being on the ballot in an upcoming contest against Angela Eagle - and possibly Owen Smith. Labour MPs are determined that there should be only one candidate that takes on Corbyn to maximise the chance of winning, with a number preferring Smith. It is understood that he will wade into the debate this morning. Does anyone have a Brexit plan yet? Not quite, although surely it\u2019s getting closer. If anyone is likely to have one, it\u2019ll be the man or woman who Theresa (\u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d) May will name as the government\u2019s new \u2018Brexit minister\u2019. May\u2019s spokesperson has already said that work was already underway to set up a new department dedicated to negotiating Britain\u2019s exit from the EU. \u201cCivil servants have already been charged with finding a building to house the Brexit department \u2013 an indication of Theresa\u2019s commitment to get on with delivering the verdict of the EU referendum. Brexit means Brexit and we\u2019re going to make a success of it,\u201d she has said. You should also know: Labour\u2019s civil war is continuing, with the possibility that a legal challenge could be mounted against Tuesday\u2019s NEC ruling Mark Carney has agreed to hand notes of private meetings he had with the chancellor in the run-up to the EU referendum to MPs, after a Treasury select committee hearing where the governor of the Bank of England faced questions about whether he had \u201cpeddled phoney forecasts\u201d about the risks of a vote for Brexit. The government\u2019s Prevent strategy aimed at combating homegrown terrorism is stifling freedom of expression within the classroom and risks being counterproductive, a human rights report has warned. Diary 10am: Economists for Brexit press conference 10am: Michael Gove gives evidence to Commons Justice Committee on radicalisation in prisons Noon: David Cameron\u2019s final PMQs. House of Commons Theresa May\u2019s first speech as Prime Minister, 10 Downing Street 6.15pm: Angela Eagle speech on Europe Read these \u2022 Campaigners behind the two main Brexit groups, Vote Leave and Leave.EU, plan to re-establish their efforts into anti-EU pressure groups that could act as a constraint on Theresa May, the FT reports. \u2022 What might David Cameron do next? The Spectator\u2019s Isabel Hardman writes that the outgoing prime minister sees John Major as a better model for life after Downing Street than Tony Blair She adds: \u201cHe might, though, choose to pursue his interest in life chances and social mobility that he never got a chance to fulfil as Prime Minister because of his early exit. So tomorrow won\u2019t be the end for Cameron \u2013 just the start of another type of public service.\u201d \u2022 Cameron is to hand out honours to some of his closest aides at Number 10 in a move which risks starting another \u201ccronies\u201d row, the Telegraph claims. \u2022 If you thought the new prime minister was the continuity candidate in the Tory party, you may have to think again, writes Martin Kettle in the Guardian. Baffling claim of the day \u201cAs plotters, they were fucking useless\u201d - shadow chancellor John McDonnell to supporters at at a Corbyn rally on Tuesday night. Perhaps not entirely incorrect - after all, Jeremy Corbyn remains in place as leader of the Labour party - although it\u2019s the kind of language which his statement which his opponents are likely to use to their advantage.

His win was so emphatic that they could not deny it. And so they decided not to understand its root causes but to undo its effect.</p> <p>Corbyn campaigned against austerity, war and nuclear weapons in particular, and for a reorientation back towards Labour\u2019s socialist roots in general. He spoke in plain English of big principle rather than the evasive vacuities of managerial electoralism. His critics, unable to imagine a world in which it was possible that a person with his politics or style could be the overwhelming choice of Labour party members, concluded the problem was not their imagination but reality. The voters had simply made the wrong decision. Corbyn had to go.</p> <p>The Parliamentary Labour party has obsessed about nothing else for the best part of a year. In all that time it has not produced a plausible strategy, programme or policy designed to win back those who voted for Corbyn. Until this morning, the best it could come up with as a response to the groundswell of frustration over its rightward drift and ideological void was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/11/angela-eagle-jeremy-corbyn-labour-party-leadership-leader\" title=\"\">Angela Eagle</a>. Then came the news that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/13/owen-smith-to-challenge-jeremy-corbyn-labour-leadership\" title=\"\">former shadow department of work and pensions secretary Owen Smith would run</a>.</p> <p>Smith has only been in parliament since 2010, but what he has done suggests at least some affinity with the mood of the party. He voted against bombing Syria and was absent for the vote against the welfare bill but has opposed most cuts. Like most people in the country, I know precious little about him. I hope he\u2019s good. The party is in dire need of a debate that goes beyond Corbyn to the crucial issues of how to engage with its core vote.</p> <p>Eagle is a different matter altogether. It is clear whom Eagle is standing against: Corbyn. But that is not a plan \u2013 it is a grievance. It is not at all clear what she stands for beyond the leadership. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/11/angela-eagle-jeremy-corbyn-labour-party-leadership-leader\" title=\"\">At her launch she floated not a single idea</a>. She has a record. She voted for the Iraq war (and against any effort to investigate it), for the introduction of tuition fees, for bombing Syria, and she abstained on the welfare bill \u2013 all positions that were immensely unpopular in the party and most of which remain unpopular in the country. Claiming that Corbyn is unable to provide the leadership necessary, she insists. \u201cI will unite, I will not divide. I can bring our party together again.\u201d Her strategy for uniting the party thus far is to stand against a leader who won 59% of the vote and has been in power for less than a year.</p> <p>So the world is turned on its head. At a moment where the Tories are uniquely vulnerable, the PLP does not rally around its elected leader and seek to exploit its disarray, it creates its own disarray and then blames its leader for not effectively opposing the Tories. Seeing a shift to the left in the party, it presents a rightwing candidate. Corbyn is supposedly to blame for all of this. It is he who is selfish and egomaniacal \u2013 not the people who launched the coup to replace him. It is he, with the support of the membership and the unions, who is isolated \u2013 not the PLP. If he loved the Labour party, he would abandon the overwhelming majority who voted for him and his political agenda and give it back \u2013 the sense of entitlement could not be more evident \u2013 to its rightful owners.</p> <p>The urgency with which this project has been pursued is, ostensibly, due to an impending general election that Corbyn could never win. This may well be true. But since neither Eagle nor any of the people Corbyn defeated last year would likely do any better, this is primarily an issue not of Corbyn\u2019s leadership but of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/13/corbyn-rivals-labour-sinking-leadership\" title=\"\">erosion in the party\u2019s base of support that has been taking place for a generation</a>.</p> <p>Those who failed to foresee the Tories winning a parliamentary majority, Corbyn winning the leadership or the Brexit defeat long ago predicted the outcome of the next election under Corbyn and declared it a spectacular and unprecedented disaster. Evidence for failure on this scale has been thin on the ground. There have been <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/elections-and-voting/by-elections/by-elections-since-2015-general-election/\" title=\"\">four byelections since Corbyn was elected</a>; Labour retained all four seats. In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/dec/04/labour-sweep-to-conclusive-victory-in-oldham-byelection\" title=\"\">three it upped its share of the vote by between 5.9% and 8.7%</a>; in one its share fell by just 0.3%. In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/06/uk-elections-at-a-glance-the-key-points\" title=\"\">local elections the party did not soar but did not crash either</a>, holding on to bellwether towns like Nuneaton, Stevenage, Southampton and Crawley, and receiving a slightly higher share of the vote than the Tories.</p> <p>But the facts ceased to matter. So long as his opponents concentrated on Corbyn and ignored everything he stood for, they could maintain this narrowly focused pursuit to some effect. Corbyn was woefully unprepared to be leader. Nobody expected him to win, least of all himself. Corbyn stood to make a difference, not to lead a party. It has, at times, been painful to watch him learn on the job in such a very public way. I have desperately wanted him to raise his game, in the knowledge that given the hostility of the media and the mutiny within the party, the game was rigged against him. Occasionally I have wished on him the tough love of my late Caribbean mother, who would tell me growing up, \u201cLife is not fair. In this country you will have to work twice as hard to get half as far. Get on with it.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/12/labour-leadership-nec-jeremy-corbyn\">Eyes down, apocalypse bingo players: Labour\u2019s Jedi council has spoken | Marina Hyde</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nonetheless, it was also always obvious that the central issue was not performative but political. If Corbyn had had the charm of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/justin-trudeau\" title=\"\">Justin Trudeau</a> and the oratorical prowess of Barack Obama, a handful of those who initially gave him the benefit of the doubt or even backed him enthusiastically and have since peeled off might have remained in his camp.</p> <p>I share some of that frustration. But the fact is that so long as he kept the same politics the general trajectory that led us to this moment was set. Before he had failed to sing an anthem, bungled his delivery at the despatch box or gone on holiday during the referendum, the necessity of his demise had been determined.</p> <p>Once it became clear that he was likely to win, Labour excluded new members (many on dubious grounds) and questioned the validity of its own election process. A few grandees talked openly about simply cancelling the election altogether. The election was declared tainted not because it had been rigged or won on false pretences, but because the wrong person was elected. Corbyn\u2019s leadership was never regarded as legitimate by the party\u2019s establishment, any more than Obama\u2019s presidency was accepted by the American right, who similarly made every effort to stonewall him while blaming him for not getting anything done.</p> <p>Contempt for Corbyn is rivalled only by disdain for the party that elected him. His critics argue that the membership is unrepresentative of the country as a whole. By definition most political memberships are, but that does not mean they represent nothing. In this case the Labour party membership represents two quite crucial constituencies. First, the group that will help select the Labour MPs and leaders. And second, the group that will knock on doors and staff the phones to fight for a Labour government. Those are no small things.</p> <p>If Corbyn resigned tomorrow, the issues that he raised would still stand, and the Parliamentary Labour party would still have no coherent response to them. He did not create the dislocation between the PLP and the membership, he merely illustrates it. His critics say they want their party back. Their party may well say it wants Corbyn back. In the absence of any reckoning as to how that discrepancy came about and any idea what to do about it, his critics are going to destroy the party they claim they love to save it from a leader it prefers.</p>",

His critics, unable to imagine a world in which it was possible that a person with his politics or style could be the overwhelming choice of Labour party members, concluded the problem was not their imagination but reality. The voters had simply made the wrong decision. Corbyn had to go. The Parliamentary Labour party has obsessed about nothing else for the best part of a year. In all that time it has not produced a plausible strategy, programme or policy designed to win back those who voted for Corbyn. Until this morning, the best it could come up with as a response to the groundswell of frustration over its rightward drift and ideological void was Angela Eagle. Then came the news that former shadow department of work and pensions secretary Owen Smith would run. Smith has only been in parliament since 2010, but what he has done suggests at least some affinity with the mood of the party. He voted against bombing Syria and was absent for the vote against the welfare bill but has opposed most cuts. Like most people in the country, I know precious little about him. I hope he\u2019s good. The party is in dire need of a debate that goes beyond Corbyn to the crucial issues of how to engage with its core vote. Eagle is a different matter altogether. It is clear whom Eagle is standing against: Corbyn. But that is not a plan \u2013 it is a grievance. It is not at all clear what she stands for beyond the leadership. At her launch she floated not a single idea. She has a record. She voted for the Iraq war (and against any effort to investigate it), for the introduction of tuition fees, for bombing Syria, and she abstained on the welfare bill \u2013 all positions that were immensely unpopular in the party and most of which remain unpopular in the country. Claiming that Corbyn is unable to provide the leadership necessary, she insists. \u201cI will unite, I will not divide. I can bring our party together again.\u201d Her strategy for uniting the party thus far is to stand against a leader who won 59% of the vote and has been in power for less than a year. So the world is turned on its head. At a moment where the Tories are uniquely vulnerable, the PLP does not rally around its elected leader and seek to exploit its disarray, it creates its own disarray and then blames its leader for not effectively opposing the Tories. Seeing a shift to the left in the party, it presents a rightwing candidate. Corbyn is supposedly to blame for all of this. It is he who is selfish and egomaniacal \u2013 not the people who launched the coup to replace him. It is he, with the support of the membership and the unions, who is isolated \u2013 not the PLP. If he loved the Labour party, he would abandon the overwhelming majority who voted for him and his political agenda and give it back \u2013 the sense of entitlement could not be more evident \u2013 to its rightful owners. The urgency with which this project has been pursued is, ostensibly, due to an impending general election that Corbyn could never win. This may well be true. But since neither Eagle nor any of the people Corbyn defeated last year would likely do any better, this is primarily an issue not of Corbyn\u2019s leadership but of the erosion in the party\u2019s base of support that has been taking place for a generation. Those who failed to foresee the Tories winning a parliamentary majority, Corbyn winning the leadership or the Brexit defeat long ago predicted the outcome of the next election under Corbyn and declared it a spectacular and unprecedented disaster. Evidence for failure on this scale has been thin on the ground. There have been four byelections since Corbyn was elected; Labour retained all four seats. In three it upped its share of the vote by between 5.9% and 8.7%; in one its share fell by just 0.3%. In local elections the party did not soar but did not crash either, holding on to bellwether towns like Nuneaton, Stevenage, Southampton and Crawley, and receiving a slightly higher share of the vote than the Tories. But the facts ceased to matter. So long as his opponents concentrated on Corbyn and ignored everything he stood for, they could maintain this narrowly focused pursuit to some effect. Corbyn was woefully unprepared to be leader. Nobody expected him to win, least of all himself. Corbyn stood to make a difference, not to lead a party. It has, at times, been painful to watch him learn on the job in such a very public way. I have desperately wanted him to raise his game, in the knowledge that given the hostility of the media and the mutiny within the party, the game was rigged against him. Occasionally I have wished on him the tough love of my late Caribbean mother, who would tell me growing up, \u201cLife is not fair. In this country you will have to work twice as hard to get half as far. Get on with it.\u201d Nonetheless, it was also always obvious that the central issue was not performative but political. If Corbyn had had the charm of Justin Trudeau and the oratorical prowess of Barack Obama, a handful of those who initially gave him the benefit of the doubt or even backed him enthusiastically and have since peeled off might have remained in his camp. I share some of that frustration. But the fact is that so long as he kept the same politics the general trajectory that led us to this moment was set. Before he had failed to sing an anthem, bungled his delivery at the despatch box or gone on holiday during the referendum, the necessity of his demise had been determined. Once it became clear that he was likely to win, Labour excluded new members (many on dubious grounds) and questioned the validity of its own election process. A few grandees talked openly about simply cancelling the election altogether. The election was declared tainted not because it had been rigged or won on false pretences, but because the wrong person was elected. Corbyn\u2019s leadership was never regarded as legitimate by the party\u2019s establishment, any more than Obama\u2019s presidency was accepted by the American right, who similarly made every effort to stonewall him while blaming him for not getting anything done. Contempt for Corbyn is rivalled only by disdain for the party that elected him. His critics argue that the membership is unrepresentative of the country as a whole. By definition most political memberships are, but that does not mean they represent nothing. In this case the Labour party membership represents two quite crucial constituencies. First, the group that will help select the Labour MPs and leaders. And second, the group that will knock on doors and staff the phones to fight for a Labour government. Those are no small things. If Corbyn resigned tomorrow, the issues that he raised would still stand, and the Parliamentary Labour party would still have no coherent response to them. He did not create the dislocation between the PLP and the membership, he merely illustrates it. His critics say they want their party back. Their party may well say it wants Corbyn back. In the absence of any reckoning as to how that discrepancy came about and any idea what to do about it, his critics are going to destroy the party they claim they love to save it from a leader it prefers.",

          "bodyText": "Catching cheating boyfriends, stumbling across dead bodies and advertising one\u2019s services as a professional Pok\u00e9mon Go trainer \u2013 less than a week since the launch of the virtual-meets-real-world app Pok\u00e9mon Go and the stories it has sparked are kookier than the names of the critters its fans are trying to catch. Cheating boyfriend Evan Scribner, a resident of Sunnyside, Queens, told the New York Post that his girlfriend spotted his infidelities after accessing his Pok\u00e9mon Go app and noticing that he\u2019d caught a Pok\u00e9mon in the exact location of his ex-girlfriend\u2019s house in Bushwick, Brooklyn. \u201cShe saw that I had caught a Pok\u00e9mon while at my ex\u2019s house,\u201d Scribner told the Post. \u201cShe found out last night at my house and hasn\u2019t contacted me since then.\u201d Professional Pok\u00e9mon trainer No time to spend your summer days walking the streets in search of Pok\u00e9stops when you also have a real job? No problem. Craigslist ads are now popping up for Pok\u00e9mon trainers, with prices in New York City ranging from $20-30 per hour. Arthur, a 26-year-old lifelong Pok\u00e9mon fan, is offering his services for $25 per hour: I can focus on catching a specific species of Pok\u00e9mon to evolve for you. I can focus on training up your Pok\u00e9mon to get your local gyms on lockdown. I can focus on catching Pok\u00e9mon of a specific type. And of course, I will gladly walk out of my way to find new Pok\u00e9mon to add to your Pok\u00e9dex. Ivy St Ive, a journalist and Pok\u00e9mon fan, also offered her services for $20 an hour: I will walk around in 1-4 hour shifts signed in to your account capturing every single Pokemon I come into contact with, activating every Poke Stop I pass and walking nonstop to help hatch your eggs. I\u2019ll even send you hourly updates while you\u2019re at work/class/on a hot date informing you of any really exciting things I\u2019ve come across for you. AP Stylebook tick of approval The harbingers of published grammar, AP Stylebook, announced today the rules for writing about Pok\u00e9mon Go. The official website of Pok\u00e9mon Go spells the app\u2019s name with an accent but AP Stylebook has decreed the accent over the \u201ce\u201d must disappear. It also deemed the term \u201cPokestop\u201d OK (hence we felt safe using it earlier). Just to put this in perspective, AP Stylebook only permitted from 1 June of this year that internet could be written without a capital \u201ci\u201d. Dead bodies and funeral games A 19-year-old girl in Wyoming stumbled across a dead body in a river while playing Pok\u00e9mon Go over the weekend. \u201cI was trying to get a Pok\u00e9mon from a natural water resource,\u201d said Shayla Wiggins. \u201cI was walking towards the bridge along the shore when I saw something in the water ... I had to take a second look and I realized it was a body,\u201d she added. Even if people aren\u2019t stumbling across dead bodies, they are finding plenty of Pok\u00e9mon in completely inappropriate places, such as coffins at funerals or next to their wives in hospital giving birth. O Canada, no Pok\u00e9mon Go Our fine neighbors to the north might have Justin Trudeau but they don\u2019t have Pok\u00e9mon Go. At least not officially \u2013 although many are finding ways of skirting the system through third-party apps. But Canadians still have their sense of humor, creating piles of memes about the Pok\u00e9mon Go shortage.",

          "body": "<p>On 14 June 2016, as it does once a month, the entire Calgary city council \u2013 including mayor Naheed Nenshi \u2013 spent nearly the whole day reviewing individual applications for \u201csecondary suites\u201d. If it sounds like a tedious grind, that\u2019s because it is. Secondary suites are minor house alterations \u2013 for example, converting a basement into a separate rental unit. The council debates and votes on each one, one by one. It can be a rancorous process, and it\u2019s inevitably <a href=\"http://www.calgarysun.com/2016/06/17/calgary-needs-a-secondary-suite-deal--whats-happening-now-is-a-colossal-waste-of-time\">far too microscopic in scaleto occupy so much of the time</a> of council of a city of more than a million people.</p> <p>But Calgary is no ordinary city. As the corporate home of Canada\u2019s oil and gas industry, it has long been particularly friendly to the car. Secondary suites, however, present a challenge to the automobile\u2019s supremacy: they increase housing density, and ease the push to expand ever further into the suburbs.</p> <p>So when Nenshi came into office in 2010 on a progressive pledge to fight urban sprawl and <a href=\"http://www.calgarysun.com/2013/07/16/looming-post-flood-housing-crisis-prompts-mayor-naheed-nenshi-to-push-for-legalizing-secondary-suites\">bring in city-wide secondary suite legislation</a>, a fight was indeed what he found. Twice, city councillors representing the suburban wards have voted down his secondary suite proposal. And so the interminable monthly approval discussions drone on \u2013 a routine reminder that Calgary still has a long way to go in its transformation from a city of expansive suburbs and broad, multi-lane expressways into the denser, more emphatically urban place so powerfully symbolised by Nenshi\u2019s ascent to mayor.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d784bdbcaea236556b5868f7df045a6e006350d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d784bdbcaea236556b5868f7df045a6e006350d/0_0_3500_2455/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mayor Nenshi at the annual Stampede rodeo parade in Calgary.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"701\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mayor Naheed Nenshi at the annual Stampede parade in Calgary.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Todd Korol/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Calgary\u2019s battle against sprawl is duplicated in one way or another in every Canadian city. Blessed with abundant space and cheap fuel, the country\u2019s cities grew mostly outwards instead of upwards as they prospered in the decades after the second world war. The aspirational Canadian lifestyle that emerged in those years was a wholly suburban one \u2013 a detached home surrounded by a tidy putting-green lawn on a wide curving avenue, with two cars in the garage to drive down fast-moving freeways to work, school and the mall. </p> <p>Every Canadian city now wrestles with the outsized cost of providing access to those increasingly distant suburbs. Freeways grow ever-more clogged with traffic, and infrastructure bends and cracks under the strain. In Toronto, a pitched battle has been fought over the <a href=\"https://www.thestar.com/opinion/commentary/2015/05/11/for-torontos-future-we-need-to-tear-down-the-gardiner-expressway.html\">future of an elevated waterfront highway</a>, leading to a <a href=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2016/01/19/new-favoured-east-gardiner-would-cost-more-than-1-billion.html\">compromise that pleases almost no one</a>. The city council in nearby Hamilton spent the spring arguing whether or not to accept C$1bn (\u00a3600m) in funding from the provincial government for light-rail transit (LRT). Last summer, voters in proudly green Vancouver <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/transit-referendum-voters-say-no-to-new-metro-vancouver-tax-transit-improvements-1.3134857\">rejected a proposed tax</a> aimed at expanding the region\u2019s transit system. The progressive new federal government led by Justin Trudeau has promised to invest in urban infrastructure with a zeal not seen in decades, but it seems no Canadian city has quite settled on what\u2019s needed to combat the sprawl that so vexes them. </p> <p>The battle can seem particularly pitched \u2013 and urgent \u2013 in Calgary. Its traditional image in the collective Canadian consciousness is as a swaggering city of oil riches, outsized cowboy hats and extra-large pickup trucks.

          "bodyText": "On 14 June 2016, as it does once a month, the entire Calgary city council \u2013 including mayor Naheed Nenshi \u2013 spent nearly the whole day reviewing individual applications for \u201csecondary suites\u201d. If it sounds like a tedious grind, that\u2019s because it is. Secondary suites are minor house alterations \u2013 for example, converting a basement into a separate rental unit. The council debates and votes on each one, one by one. It can be a rancorous process, and it\u2019s inevitably far too microscopic in scaleto occupy so much of the time of council of a city of more than a million people. But Calgary is no ordinary city. As the corporate home of Canada\u2019s oil and gas industry, it has long been particularly friendly to the car. Secondary suites, however, present a challenge to the automobile\u2019s supremacy: they increase housing density, and ease the push to expand ever further into the suburbs. So when Nenshi came into office in 2010 on a progressive pledge to fight urban sprawl and bring in city-wide secondary suite legislation, a fight was indeed what he found. Twice, city councillors representing the suburban wards have voted down his secondary suite proposal. And so the interminable monthly approval discussions drone on \u2013 a routine reminder that Calgary still has a long way to go in its transformation from a city of expansive suburbs and broad, multi-lane expressways into the denser, more emphatically urban place so powerfully symbolised by Nenshi\u2019s ascent to mayor. Calgary\u2019s battle against sprawl is duplicated in one way or another in every Canadian city. Blessed with abundant space and cheap fuel, the country\u2019s cities grew mostly outwards instead of upwards as they prospered in the decades after the second world war. The aspirational Canadian lifestyle that emerged in those years was a wholly suburban one \u2013 a detached home surrounded by a tidy putting-green lawn on a wide curving avenue, with two cars in the garage to drive down fast-moving freeways to work, school and the mall. Every Canadian city now wrestles with the outsized cost of providing access to those increasingly distant suburbs. Freeways grow ever-more clogged with traffic, and infrastructure bends and cracks under the strain. In Toronto, a pitched battle has been fought over the future of an elevated waterfront highway, leading to a compromise that pleases almost no one. The city council in nearby Hamilton spent the spring arguing whether or not to accept C$1bn (\u00a3600m) in funding from the provincial government for light-rail transit (LRT). Last summer, voters in proudly green Vancouver rejected a proposed tax aimed at expanding the region\u2019s transit system. The progressive new federal government led by Justin Trudeau has promised to invest in urban infrastructure with a zeal not seen in decades, but it seems no Canadian city has quite settled on what\u2019s needed to combat the sprawl that so vexes them. The battle can seem particularly pitched \u2013 and urgent \u2013 in Calgary. Its traditional image in the collective Canadian consciousness is as a swaggering city of oil riches, outsized cowboy hats and extra-large pickup trucks. It occupies wide, flat prairie, meaning a visitor landing at the airport sees the full extent of the city\u2019s sprawl as nowhere else. (Few visitors to beautiful, densely built downtown Vancouver see much of sprawling suburban enclaves like Maple Ridge and Port Coquitlam, hidden behind picturesque mountains.) And now there is the collapse in global oil prices, a direct threat to the engine of Calgary\u2019s explosive growth. For all these reasons, Nenshi has come to occupy a larger patch of the nation\u2019s political landscape than might be expected for the mayor of its fourth-largest city. If Calgary can beat back urban sprawl \u2013 so the line of thinking goes \u2013 surely any city can. This outsized spotlight has shone on Nenshi since the day he was elected.

The election five years later of a leftwing provincial government \u2013 now the only legislature in Canada controlled by the New Democratic Party \u2013 has amplified the sense of surprise.

Behind her, the mountains of the North Shore \u2013 the view that launched a thousand bidding wars \u2013 rise through mist. \u201cThree-bedroom townhouse, 1,400 sq ft, C$1.5m (\u00a3800,000). You could start a family in a place like this. Way, way out of my price range, though.\u201d</p> <p>Fong moves on, scrolling through half a dozen homes, each smaller than the last, until she arrives at a tiny, 500 sq ft condominium on the east side of the city. \u201cUnassuming\u201d would be a generous way to describe how it looks from the photos, which, tellingly, are all exterior shots. \u201cYou could live there if you only had one kid, right?\u201d she says with a grim smile.<br></p> <p>An urban planning researcher, Fong divides her time between Vancouver, where her elderly parents live, and Toronto, where she\u2019s finishing a doctorate. She grew up in Vancouver, has deep roots in the city, and plans to settle here with her husband, a home renovator. But she has looked on with a mixture of frustration and horror as the cost of housing in Canada\u2019s famously liveable city rise beyond the means of young professionals like her.<br></p> <p>\u201cWhen you think it can\u2019t get any worse, it does. So you keep adjusting your expectations, you know?\u201d<br></p> <p>Over the past year, the price of a single family house in Vancouver increased by an incredible 30%, to <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/vancouver-real-estate-house-prices-1.3564528\">an average of $1.4m</a>. It\u2019s just the latest, most dramatic jump in an already dramatic long-term trend that has turned the beautiful but unassuming Canadian city into one of the world\u2019s least affordable, with a <a href=\"http://www.demographia.com/dhi.pdf\">housing price-to-income ratio of 10.8</a>. That\u2019s third after Hong Kong and Sydney, and well ahead of London, which ranks eighth at 8.5. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cd8ece46fe8bf7a93898c3b8d7965120749d7ce6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd8ece46fe8bf7a93898c3b8d7965120749d7ce6/0_0_4000_2669/1000.jpg\" alt=\"protest house prices Vancouver\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The average single family home in Vancouver costs C$1.4m.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jimmy Jeong/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Driving the rise is an unprecedented flood of foreign capital, mainly from China. \u201cWhat you have is a huge pool of very wealthy people who want to hedge against uncertainty back home,\u201d says Thomas Davidoff, a real estate economist at the University of British Columbia (UBC). \u201cCombine anxious money \u2013 a lot of it \u2013 with a beautiful gateway city that has limited space to build, low property taxes, lax regulation on capital flows, and wealth-friendly immigration programmes, and you get a market like this one,\u201d \u2013 a market where an ordinary house with a waterfront view can sell for $15m while people earning local wages struggle to buy or rent a home. </p> <p>In spite of spiking inequality, policymakers have been slow to acknowledge the problem of foreign capital. Public debate about Vancouver\u2019s affordability crisis has, until recently, been surprisingly circumspect \u2013 due in no small part to a very Canadian discomfort with talking about race.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019re a polite and tolerant society that has been thoroughly schooled in the virtues of multiculturalism</p> <footer> <cite>David Ley</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <h2><strong>From leftwing mecca to resort town for the super-rich</strong></h2> <p>Chinese immigration has always been a defining social, cultural and economic force in Vancouver \u2013 and Vancouverites know what the wrong side of history looks like. Railway workers from southern China began arriving as early as the 19th century, and at the beginning of the 20th century Vancouver was the stage for some of Canada\u2019s ugliest episodes of racism: anti-Chinese riots, a \u201chead tax\u201d on ethnic Chinese, and later an outright ban on Chinese immigration. </p> <p>As the city grew into a mecca of leftwing politics and hippie self-expression in the 1960s and 70s, the ideals of tolerance and inclusion became central to the civic self-image. Today, more than 30% of residents claim Chinese ancestry and the city is, by the standards of most western countries, remarkably easygoing \u2013 though this ideal of harmony never quite squared with immigrants\u2019 own experiences. Fong notes the pressure her parents\u2019 generation felt \u2013 and still feels \u2013 to assimilate. \u201cWhen we were growing up, they encouraged us to speak English at home instead of Chinese,\u201d she says.</p> <p>The lessons of the past go some way to explaining Vancouver\u2019s almost religious embrace of multiculturalism, says David Ley, a UBC geography professor and wealth migration expert. \u201cI think it\u2019s very much part of the Canadian psyche to want to avoid these discussions,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re a polite and tolerant society that has been thoroughly schooled in the virtues of multiculturalism.\u201d</p> <p>Unfortunately, this also amplifies the uneasiness around the affordability discussion.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating,\u201d says Justin Fung, an activist with Housing Action for Local Taxpayers, a local advocacy group. \u201c[The crisis] is a policy issue, it\u2019s a social justice issue, and up until now, everyone is saying, \u2018We\u2019re nice, we can\u2019t talk about this.\u2019 Well, if you can\u2019t even talk about where the money is coming from, you can\u2019t do anything about it.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4f871cf57c11b15ea8e5a8ad241f80e4b0537194\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f871cf57c11b15ea8e5a8ad241f80e4b0537194/0_140_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A mansion under construction in a Vancouver neighbourhood popular with Chinese buyers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A mansion under construction in a Vancouver neighbourhood popular with Chinese buyers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Canada has long targeted \u201canxious\u201d money from Asia. Right now, if you invest a five-year, interest-free amount of <a href=\"http://www.immigration.ca/en/quebec-immigrant-investor-program.html\">$800,000, you can effectively buy citizenship</a>. <a href=\"https://composer.gutools.co.uk/content/57691750e4b0be1dc1c9aa41#sdendnote2sym\"></a>(By contrast, a similar scheme in Britain, the Immigrant Investor Programme, offers citizenship for between \u00a32m and \u00a310m.) Such programmes have driven the globalisation of Vancouver\u2019s real estate market. They were created in the 1980s with Hong Kong\u2019s elite in mind: millionaires arrived by the thousands from Hong Kong ahead of the 1997 handover to China, and there was tension in Vancouver then, too.</p> <p>What\u2019s different about the current wave of wealth migration is the scale and speed of it. \u201cHong Kong is a small territory,\u201d Ley says. \u201cWith China you have an amazing depth of capital \u2013 capital which is more and more eager to leave the country.\u201d</p> <p>That capital is turning Vancouver into a resort town for the wealthy. Heritage homes are being knocked down and replaced with mega-mansions. Teenagers drive quarter-million-dollar Lamborghinis. Nowhere is the fascination, scorn and exaggeration to which these gaudy lifestyles of the Asian nouveau riches are subject better exemplified than in <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/02/22/chinas-rich-kids-head-west\">Ultra Rich Asian Girls of Vancouver</a>. The reality TV show follows the daughters of elite Chinese families as they float through a Vancouver that would be unrecognisable to most Vancouverites \u2013 including, probably, some of the ultra-rich the show purports to represent.</p> <p>\u201cFrom a western perspective, maybe there\u2019s a certain crassness,\u201d says Sonny Wong, a marketer who advises wealthy newcomers. \u201cI had a chicken farmer from southern China come to my office. His income the previous year was US$100m. He doesn\u2019t have a university education. Ultimately, though, he just wants to do well for himself and his family. So what do you do when you move to a new country? You buy a car and a house. And a $5m house<strong> </strong>and a Maserati are within his means. If you can afford it, that\u2019s what you buy.\u201d</p> <p>What matters isn\u2019t that wealthy people are immigrating to Vancouver from China, or anywhere else, really. It\u2019s that they continue to earn the vast bulk of their <a href=\"https://www.amazon.ca/Millionaire-Migrants-Trans-Pacific-Life-Lines/dp/1405192925\">wealth outside of Canada</a> and they use that wealth to invest in Vancouver real estate. As a result, housing prices have decoupled from the labour market, putting people who earn local wages at a major disadvantage. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.ca/Millionaire-Migrants-Trans-Pacific-Life-Lines/dp/1405192925\">Research by Ley</a> and <a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.2747/0272-3638.31.6.724\">other academics</a> shows a clear link between global wealth migration and local affordability.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"98c3b51dbe1ad4a98a4a7cc32d625b1c9f9d934d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/98c3b51dbe1ad4a98a4a7cc32d625b1c9f9d934d/0_201_4000_2401/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vancouver, luxury retailer\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Customers in Vancouver queue for a release of vintage Bordeaux.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While some economic migrants do start businesses here, the problem with Canada\u2019s cash-for-citizenship programme is that it doesn\u2019t encourage long-term investment or entrepreneurship beyond the initial outlay of money. Millionaire migrants might as well establish their families in Vancouver and continue to build their fortunes in China \u2013 and they do. A <a href=\"http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/pdf/pub/e2-2013_FBIP.pdf\">study by the Canadian government</a> shows that, 10 years after arriving in the country, immigrants who used the investor programme declared marginal incomes, and paid only a fifth as much income tax as other Canadians. </p> <p>Understandably, this outrages people. \u201cIf someone wants to live here, they shouldn\u2019t just be parking a family here and earning all their money elsewhere,\u201d says Raymond Wong, an engineer who grew up in east Vancouver, a traditionally working class part of the city that has seen prices skyrocket. \u201cThey should be contributing to the economy, putting down roots, fitting into the culture.\u201d </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The issue here is [the buyers\u2019] millionaire-ness, not their Chinese-ness. And I think most people get that</p> <footer> <cite>Ian Young</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Compounding the frustration is the fact that, according to experts, a major portion of the money flooding into the market is hot. Officially, the Chinese government limits the amount of money individuals can take out of the country per year to US$50,000. Wong recently launched an <a href=\"https://petitions.parl.gc.ca/en/Petition/Details?Petition=e-281\">online petition</a> to strengthen Canada\u2019s notoriously lax federal anti-money laundering measures. It has attracted more than 10,000 signatures. </p> <p>While such frustrations are unquestionably legitimate and stronger regulation is badly needed, the narrative of \u201cputting down roots\u201d makes some people uneasy. Melissa Fong supports affordability measures, but worries that talk of roots raises the spectre of a more insidious form of racism: respectability politics. \u201cIt\u2019s the old question of what is a \u2018good\u2019 Chinese?\u201d she says. </p> <p>Ian Young, author of the South China Morning Post\u2019s enormously popular <a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/article-type/hongcouver\">Hongcouver blog</a>, the must-read chronicle of Vancouver\u2019s affordability woes, is more sanguine. \u201cWhen you have thousands of super-rich settling in a new city in very short time, that\u2019s discomfiting \u2026 people don\u2019t know what to think,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the issue here is [the buyers\u2019] millionaire-ness, not their Chinese-ness. And I think most people get that.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018<strong>An almost uniquely Vancouver reaction\u2019</strong></h2> <p>And yet, hiding behind an <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/canadias-trudeau-cites-risk-in-curbing-foreign-real-estate-investment-1450642003\">absence of good data</a>, government officials have mostly refused even to admit that foreign capital is making it impossible to buy a house in Vancouver \u2013 let alone act to level the playing field, for instance via a progressive property tax. </p> <p>\u201cI find it astonishing that Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney, and London all have had right-wing, market-friendly governments which have intervened quite aggressively in trying to address unaffordability, yet nothing has happened here,\u201d Ley says. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"07727d2dd5a5a4cb802242cc5ecab45a87cc3b5f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07727d2dd5a5a4cb802242cc5ecab45a87cc3b5f/0_0_3501_2290/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chinese New Year parade from a parade in Vancouver.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"654\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vancouver\u2019s Chinese New Year parade \u2013 30% of people in the city claim Chinese ancestry.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Nelms/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The debate is finally shifting, mostly thanks to a controversial study. Last year, Andy Yan, a respected local urban planner and academic, took Vancouver\u2019s most expensive neighbourhoods and looked for buyers in a recent six-month period with non-anglicised Chinese names \u2013 that is, names without a \u201cwestern\u201d first or middle name, a method he and other experts defended as an imperfect but academically sound way of gauging tenure in Canada. Yan <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/ayan604/ownership-patterns-of-single-family-homes-sales-on-the-west-side-neighborhoods-of-the-city-of-vancouver-a-case-study\">found that they accounted for two-thirds of all house purchases</a>.</p> <p>Several prominent figures in the real estate industry publicly questioned <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/vancouver-foreign-ownership-study-1.3301061\">whether the study was racist</a>. So did Vancouver\u2019s mayor, Gregor Robertson. \u201cThis can\u2019t be about race, it can\u2019t be about dividing people,\u201d he told the CBC. Some in the Chinese community expressed discomfort with the study as well.</p> <p>Others, including Yan, were taken aback. \u201cMy great-granddad paid the head tax,\u201d he <a href=\"http://www.asianpacificpost.com/article/7273-non-anglicised-chinese-names-matter-vancouver%E2%80%99s-housing-market.html\">told a local newspaper</a>. \u201cSo to somehow use [concerns about] \u2018racism\u2019 to protect your privilege? That\u2019s just absurd. This is an almost uniquely Vancouver reaction.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, there is profit to be had by capitalising on people\u2019s discomfort around race. Young sees a willingness on the part of politicians and the real estate industry, faced with the prospect of unpalatable policy decisions, to maintain the status quo. \u201cThere are a lot of vested interests here,\u201d he says. \u201cTo red-flag the entire conversation as racist, I find that disturbing. This is the most profound social justice issue in Vancouver today.\u201d</p> <p>Suddenly, people were talking. Eveline Xia, a 29-year-old activist, started <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/donthave1million?src=hash\">#donthave1million</a>, a Twitter campaign to protest the exclusion of the middle class \u2013 especially young professionals \u2013 from the housing market. People from across Vancouver tweeted photos of themselves holding placards with their ages (usually 20s or 30s), level of education (usually high), and the #donthave1million hashtag. The campaign inspired a series of protests and meetings, that, with Yan\u2019s study and Young\u2019s reporting, seem to have changed the trajectory of the affordability debate. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Eveline Xia\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;To thrive, does &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CityofVancouver&quot;&gt;@CityofVancouver&lt;/a&gt; not need people like you and me? &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Donthave1million?src=hash&quot;&gt;#Donthave1million&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/VancouverNeedsUs?src=hash&quot;&gt;#VancouverNeedsUs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/BC_Housing&quot;&gt;@BC_Housing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/PKyxIIhDaH&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/PKyxIIhDaH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Eveline Xia (@eveline155) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/eveline155/status/578275524054683648&quot;&gt;March 18, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>\u201cI think Chinese-Canadian voices have helped make it okay to talk about this stuff. They\u2019ve helped to disambiguate the money and policy issues from the race issue,\u201d says activist Justin Fung.</p> <p>This month, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau finally went on record as saying <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/17/canada-housing-prices-vancouver-asia-justin-trudeau\">overseas money is \u201cobviously\u201d a factor</a>.

The desire to get money out of China is so strong and so profound that even those penalties being proposed likely won\u2019t make that much of a difference,\u201d he says. </p> <p>Close the dysfunctional and highly politicised cash-for-citizenship scheme, experts say.

          "bodyText": "\u201cHere\u2019s one,\u201d says Melissa Fong. She\u2019s browsing online real estate listings in a cafe near Vancouver\u2019s City Hall. Behind her, the mountains of the North Shore \u2013 the view that launched a thousand bidding wars \u2013 rise through mist. \u201cThree-bedroom townhouse, 1,400 sq ft, C$1.5m (\u00a3800,000). You could start a family in a place like this. Way, way out of my price range, though.\u201d Fong moves on, scrolling through half a dozen homes, each smaller than the last, until she arrives at a tiny, 500 sq ft condominium on the east side of the city. \u201cUnassuming\u201d would be a generous way to describe how it looks from the photos, which, tellingly, are all exterior shots. \u201cYou could live there if you only had one kid, right?\u201d she says with a grim smile. An urban planning researcher, Fong divides her time between Vancouver, where her elderly parents live, and Toronto, where she\u2019s finishing a doctorate. She grew up in Vancouver, has deep roots in the city, and plans to settle here with her husband, a home renovator. But she has looked on with a mixture of frustration and horror as the cost of housing in Canada\u2019s famously liveable city rise beyond the means of young professionals like her. \u201cWhen you think it can\u2019t get any worse, it does. So you keep adjusting your expectations, you know?\u201d Over the past year, the price of a single family house in Vancouver increased by an incredible 30%, to an average of $1.4m. It\u2019s just the latest, most dramatic jump in an already dramatic long-term trend that has turned the beautiful but unassuming Canadian city into one of the world\u2019s least affordable, with a housing price-to-income ratio of 10.8. That\u2019s third after Hong Kong and Sydney, and well ahead of London, which ranks eighth at 8.5. Driving the rise is an unprecedented flood of foreign capital, mainly from China. \u201cWhat you have is a huge pool of very wealthy people who want to hedge against uncertainty back home,\u201d says Thomas Davidoff, a real estate economist at the University of British Columbia (UBC). \u201cCombine anxious money \u2013 a lot of it \u2013 with a beautiful gateway city that has limited space to build, low property taxes, lax regulation on capital flows, and wealth-friendly immigration programmes, and you get a market like this one,\u201d \u2013 a market where an ordinary house with a waterfront view can sell for $15m while people earning local wages struggle to buy or rent a home. In spite of spiking inequality, policymakers have been slow to acknowledge the problem of foreign capital. Public debate about Vancouver\u2019s affordability crisis has, until recently, been surprisingly circumspect \u2013 due in no small part to a very Canadian discomfort with talking about race. From leftwing mecca to resort town for the super-rich Chinese immigration has always been a defining social, cultural and economic force in Vancouver \u2013 and Vancouverites know what the wrong side of history looks like. Railway workers from southern China began arriving as early as the 19th century, and at the beginning of the 20th century Vancouver was the stage for some of Canada\u2019s ugliest episodes of racism: anti-Chinese riots, a \u201chead tax\u201d on ethnic Chinese, and later an outright ban on Chinese immigration. As the city grew into a mecca of leftwing politics and hippie self-expression in the 1960s and 70s, the ideals of tolerance and inclusion became central to the civic self-image. Today, more than 30% of residents claim Chinese ancestry and the city is, by the standards of most western countries, remarkably easygoing \u2013 though this ideal of harmony never quite squared with immigrants\u2019 own experiences. Fong notes the pressure her parents\u2019 generation felt \u2013 and still feels \u2013 to assimilate. \u201cWhen we were growing up, they encouraged us to speak English at home instead of Chinese,\u201d she says. The lessons of the past go some way to explaining Vancouver\u2019s almost religious embrace of multiculturalism, says David Ley, a UBC geography professor and wealth migration expert. \u201cI think it\u2019s very much part of the Canadian psyche to want to avoid these discussions,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re a polite and tolerant society that has been thoroughly schooled in the virtues of multiculturalism.\u201d Unfortunately, this also amplifies the uneasiness around the affordability discussion. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating,\u201d says Justin Fung, an activist with Housing Action for Local Taxpayers, a local advocacy group. \u201c[The crisis] is a policy issue, it\u2019s a social justice issue, and up until now, everyone is saying, \u2018We\u2019re nice, we can\u2019t talk about this.\u2019 Well, if you can\u2019t even talk about where the money is coming from, you can\u2019t do anything about it.\u201d Canada has long targeted \u201canxious\u201d money from Asia. Right now, if you invest a five-year, interest-free amount of $800,000, you can effectively buy citizenship. (By contrast, a similar scheme in Britain, the Immigrant Investor Programme, offers citizenship for between \u00a32m and \u00a310m.) Such programmes have driven the globalisation of Vancouver\u2019s real estate market. They were created in the 1980s with Hong Kong\u2019s elite in mind: millionaires arrived by the thousands from Hong Kong ahead of the 1997 handover to China, and there was tension in Vancouver then, too. What\u2019s different about the current wave of wealth migration is the scale and speed of it. \u201cHong Kong is a small territory,\u201d Ley says. \u201cWith China you have an amazing depth of capital \u2013 capital which is more and more eager to leave the country.\u201d That capital is turning Vancouver into a resort town for the wealthy. Heritage homes are being knocked down and replaced with mega-mansions. Teenagers drive quarter-million-dollar Lamborghinis. Nowhere is the fascination, scorn and exaggeration to which these gaudy lifestyles of the Asian nouveau riches are subject better exemplified than in Ultra Rich Asian Girls of Vancouver. The reality TV show follows the daughters of elite Chinese families as they float through a Vancouver that would be unrecognisable to most Vancouverites \u2013 including, probably, some of the ultra-rich the show purports to represent. \u201cFrom a western perspective, maybe there\u2019s a certain crassness,\u201d says Sonny Wong, a marketer who advises wealthy newcomers. \u201cI had a chicken farmer from southern China come to my office. His income the previous year was US$100m. He doesn\u2019t have a university education. Ultimately, though, he just wants to do well for himself and his family. So what do you do when you move to a new country? You buy a car and a house. And a $5m house and a Maserati are within his means. If you can afford it, that\u2019s what you buy.\u201d What matters isn\u2019t that wealthy people are immigrating to Vancouver from China, or anywhere else, really. It\u2019s that they continue to earn the vast bulk of their wealth outside of Canada and they use that wealth to invest in Vancouver real estate. As a result, housing prices have decoupled from the labour market, putting people who earn local wages at a major disadvantage. Research by Ley and other academics shows a clear link between global wealth migration and local affordability. While some economic migrants do start businesses here, the problem with Canada\u2019s cash-for-citizenship programme is that it doesn\u2019t encourage long-term investment or entrepreneurship beyond the initial outlay of money. Millionaire migrants might as well establish their families in Vancouver and continue to build their fortunes in China \u2013 and they do. A study by the Canadian government shows that, 10 years after arriving in the country, immigrants who used the investor programme declared marginal incomes, and paid only a fifth as much income tax as other Canadians. Understandably, this outrages people. \u201cIf someone wants to live here, they shouldn\u2019t just be parking a family here and earning all their money elsewhere,\u201d says Raymond Wong, an engineer who grew up in east Vancouver, a traditionally working class part of the city that has seen prices skyrocket. \u201cThey should be contributing to the economy, putting down roots, fitting into the culture.\u201d Compounding the frustration is the fact that, according to experts, a major portion of the money flooding into the market is hot. Officially, the Chinese government limits the amount of money individuals can take out of the country per year to US$50,000. Wong recently launched an online petition to strengthen Canada\u2019s notoriously lax federal anti-money laundering measures. It has attracted more than 10,000 signatures. While such frustrations are unquestionably legitimate and stronger regulation is badly needed, the narrative of \u201cputting down roots\u201d makes some people uneasy. Melissa Fong supports affordability measures, but worries that talk of roots raises the spectre of a more insidious form of racism: respectability politics. \u201cIt\u2019s the old question of what is a \u2018good\u2019 Chinese?\u201d she says. Ian Young, author of the South China Morning Post\u2019s enormously popular Hongcouver blog, the must-read chronicle of Vancouver\u2019s affordability woes, is more sanguine. \u201cWhen you have thousands of super-rich settling in a new city in very short time, that\u2019s discomfiting \u2026 people don\u2019t know what to think,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the issue here is [the buyers\u2019] millionaire-ness, not their Chinese-ness. And I think most people get that.\u201d \u2018An almost uniquely Vancouver reaction\u2019 And yet, hiding behind an absence of good data, government officials have mostly refused even to admit that foreign capital is making it impossible to buy a house in Vancouver \u2013 let alone act to level the playing field, for instance via a progressive property tax. \u201cI find it astonishing that Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney, and London all have had right-wing, market-friendly governments which have intervened quite aggressively in trying to address unaffordability, yet nothing has happened here,\u201d Ley says. The debate is finally shifting, mostly thanks to a controversial study. Last year, Andy Yan, a respected local urban planner and academic, took Vancouver\u2019s most expensive neighbourhoods and looked for buyers in a recent six-month period with non-anglicised Chinese names \u2013 that is, names without a \u201cwestern\u201d first or middle name, a method he and other experts defended as an imperfect but academically sound way of gauging tenure in Canada. Yan found that they accounted for two-thirds of all house purchases. Several prominent figures in the real estate industry publicly questioned whether the study was racist. So did Vancouver\u2019s mayor, Gregor Robertson. \u201cThis can\u2019t be about race, it can\u2019t be about dividing people,\u201d he told the CBC. Some in the Chinese community expressed discomfort with the study as well. Others, including Yan, were taken aback. \u201cMy great-granddad paid the head tax,\u201d he told a local newspaper. \u201cSo to somehow use [concerns about] \u2018racism\u2019 to protect your privilege? That\u2019s just absurd. This is an almost uniquely Vancouver reaction.\u201d Indeed, there is profit to be had by capitalising on people\u2019s discomfort around race. Young sees a willingness on the part of politicians and the real estate industry, faced with the prospect of unpalatable policy decisions, to maintain the status quo. \u201cThere are a lot of vested interests here,\u201d he says. \u201cTo red-flag the entire conversation as racist, I find that disturbing. This is the most profound social justice issue in Vancouver today.\u201d Suddenly, people were talking. Eveline Xia, a 29-year-old activist, started #donthave1million, a Twitter campaign to protest the exclusion of the middle class \u2013 especially young professionals \u2013 from the housing market. People from across Vancouver tweeted photos of themselves holding placards with their ages (usually 20s or 30s), level of education (usually high), and the #donthave1million hashtag. The campaign inspired a series of protests and meetings, that, with Yan\u2019s study and Young\u2019s reporting, seem to have changed the trajectory of the affordability debate. \u201cI think Chinese-Canadian voices have helped make it okay to talk about this stuff. They\u2019ve helped to disambiguate the money and policy issues from the race issue,\u201d says activist Justin Fung. This month, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau finally went on record as saying overseas money is \u201cobviously\u201d a factor. Mayor Robertson spoke out in favour of a tax on absentee owners, something that 80% of Vancouverites support. Yet Young doubts that taxes alone will solve the problem. \u201cPeople shouldn\u2019t see them as an affordability buster. The desire to get money out of China is so strong and so profound that even those penalties being proposed likely won\u2019t make that much of a difference,\u201d he says. Close the dysfunctional and highly politicised cash-for-citizenship scheme, experts say. But no one expects that to happen soon. Residents Claire Immega and Peter Harvie don\u2019t. For them, the damage has been done, and they\u2019re adapting by building their own house \u2026 in Immega\u2019s mother\u2019s backyard. \u201cThe only reason it\u2019s even an option,\u201d says Immega, looking out from the window of her childhood home at a 25ft hedge that will have to be cleared, \u201cis because my mother has lived in here for the past 20 years.\u201d Immega, a lawyer, and Harvie, a property manager, face the same choice as all young professionals in Vancouver: adapt or leave. Some choose to rent with friends. Some move home with family. Others, like Immega and Harvie, opt for \u201claneway homes\u201d, an in-between measure, trading flexibility in exchange for affordability and a nicer neighbourhood. A whole sub-industry dedicated to laneway homes has sprung up. The couple won\u2019t ever be able to sell their house unless Immega\u2019s mother buys them out. Nor can they build up if they start a family, thanks to strict zoning rules. Even so, they say, they\u2019re luckier than many. \u201cFor most of our friends, it\u2019s take on a huge mortgage \u2013 if they can afford one \u2013 pay expensive rents for ever, or move away.

As a Canadian, this has given me a perspective on the relationship between our two countries. We share at least one language and the largest unprotected border on Earth. We are both Britain\u2019s offspring. And, <a href=\"https://www.rpsc.org/Library/1812/warof1812.htm\">1812 notwithstanding</a>, we have lived peacefully side by side for the lion\u2019s share of our histories.

A lot of my favourite people were born and live in Los Angeles, New York, Dallas, Seattle, Kansas City and elsewhere, and they are some of the kindest, humblest, most selfless folk I\u2019ve ever met. These people are my family \u2013 by blood or by choice. (\u201cBy Blood Or By Choice\u201d is a cool name for something.) I also really love American food. I basically eat like Macaulay Culkin in Home Alone, so getting to spend time in the country where Pop-Tarts come from is always wicked. Most of my favourite flicks are American. The US gave the world punk, hip-hop and jazz. (I don\u2019t like jazz but people seem to.) And, hoodies are probably American. </p> <p>But, like any good sibling, there\u2019s a lot of stuff that does my head in. The US is our big brother. He\u2019s older and more assertive.

Here\u2019s a flavour: The fallout from the Brexit vote reverberated through the markets on Tuesday as two more City property funds barred investors from withdrawing their cash and the Bank of England warned that risks to the financial system had begun to \u201ccrystallise\u201d. City watchers warned that further property funds would be forced to bar withdrawals as investors race for the door amid fears of a plunge in the values of office blocks and shopping centres in post Brexit Britain. The suspensions came on another day of drama on the financial markets, 11 days after the vote to leave the EU wrong-footed investors and sparked political turmoil. Developments included: The pound plunging to a new 31-year low against the dollar, falling 2% to $1.30 at one point. A closely watched survey of the services sector coming in worse than expected, indicating a sharp slowdown in the wider economy. The Bank of England easing regulations on banks to allow them to release up to \u00a3150bn worth of loans to households and businesses. Chancellor George Osborne held a summit with the heads of the major high street banks, who pledged to avoid a new credit crisis by making loans available. Here\u2019s the full tale: The City is now closed for the night, so I\u2019m going to wrap up. Here are our latest stories on the property fund freeze, and the Bank of England\u2019s attempts to calm the Brexit crisis. Goodnight, and thanks for reading and commenting. GW Although the UK property sector is undoubtedly in a serious situation, it doesn\u2019t look like we\u2019re careering into a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis. Jason Holland, managing director of City advisers Tilney Bestinvest, explains that it\u2019s different this time, partly because the Bank of England has been so proactive: The uncertainty around Brexit is undoubtedly a challenge for the property sector but this is not a post Lehman Brothers style moment when the whole financial system faced collapse and the supply of credit - key to property transactions - was in doubt. The Bank of England has set out its readiness to provide vast amounts of liquidity and interest rates look set to be cut. Talk is moving decisively in favour of a pro-growth rather than a tax hiking Budget. The stock market has weathered Brexit bettered than many predicted and successful corporate bond issues this week from British American Tobacco and Brown Forman (the producers of Jack Daniels) suggest the Sterling credit market remains open for business. The Brexit crisis has been causing angst across the global economy, with investors worried that it could hurt world economic growth.

There she goes! The pound has just slid to the $1.300 mark for the first time in over three decades, having shed 2% today. Here\u2019s a list of the biggest property funds in the UK, kindly provided by Laith Khalaf of Hargreaves Lansdown: M&amp;G Property Portfolio \u00a34255.0m *REDEMPTIONS SUSPENDED TODAY* Henderson UK Property \u00a33477.2m Aberdeen UK Property \u00a33424.2m Standard Life UK Real Estate \u00a32911m *REDEMPTIONS SUSPENDED YESTERDAY* Legal &amp; General UK Property \u00a32494.7m Aviva Investment Property Trust \u00a31842.4m *REDEMPTIONS SUSPENDED TODAY* BlackRock Global Property Securities Equity Tracker \u00a31053.7m Schroder Global Real Estate Securities \u00a3588.3m Kames Sterling Property Income \u00a3500.8m Royal London Property \u00a3402m Laith adds a word of caution: some of these funds invest in shares of property companies, which are obviously easier to sell than actual offices and shops. The pound is now hitting fresh 31-year lows.... and getting close to the $1.3000 mark for the first time since 1985. So, what happens next? Well, one hedge fund expert has tweeted that investors will now be anxiously wondering which funds might be frozen next, and getting their money out: Sometimes, though, it can be best to sit and wait: FOHF = fund of hedge funds, an investment vehicle which puts money into various hedge funds. It\u2019s been another grim day in the markets.... unless you\u2019re the FTSE 100, which has closed 0.3% higher. A good reminder that the Footsie, which is packed with international companies, is not the best barometer of the UK economy. M&amp;G\u2019s property fund owns an office block near Heathrow airport, several shopping centres, and a bunch of warehouses in Northampton. NEWSFLASH: M&amp;G has now suspended its property fund after experiencing a surge of withdrawal requests. And like Standard Life and Aviva, M&amp;G blames the Brexit uncertainty for driving investors to the exits (which are now locked) This is significant, as M&amp;G\u2019s is the biggest property fund in the UK. Here\u2019s the statement from M&amp;G, which is part of Prudential: M&amp;G SUSPENDS TRADING IN M&amp;G PROPERTY PORTFOLIO AMID BREXIT UNCERTAINTY London, 5th July 2016 - M&amp;G Investments (M&amp;G) announces a temporary suspension of trading in the shares of the M&amp;G Property Portfolio and its feeder fund. Investor redemptions in the Fund have risen markedly because of the high levels of uncertainty in the UK commercial property market since the outcome of the European Union referendum. Redemptions have now reached a point where M&amp;G believes it can best protect the interests of the funds\u2019 shareholders by seeking a temporary suspension in trading. This will allow the fund manager time to raise cash levels in a controlled manner, ensuring that any asset disposals are achieved at reasonable values. The decision to suspend was taken in agreement with the Fund\u2019s Depositary and the Financial Conduct Authority has been informed. Orders placed after 12pm on 4th July 2016 will not be processed until the suspension is lifted. M&amp;G will review the suspension every 28 days. The Property Portfolio is a broadly diversified fund which invests in 178 UK commercial properties across retail, industrial and office sectors on behalf of UK retail investors. The Fund, which managed assets of \u00a34.4 billion as at 30 June 2016, has no borrowings. To help anyone just tuning in, here\u2019s a quick recap of the key points today: Aviva, the UK investment group, has become the second company to suspend withdrawals from its property fund, following the Brexit vote. Aviva followed Standard Life, which shuttered its fund last night after experiencing a wave of redemption requests from nervous investors. It\u2019s the latest signal that last month\u2019s EU referendum result is now hitting confidence in the UK economy. An Aviva spokesperson blamed \u201cextraordinary market circumstances\u201d, adding that freezing the fund will protect all investors. Suspension of dealing will give Aviva Investors greater control in managing cashflows and conducting orderly asset sales in order to meet our obligations to investors wishing to redeem their holdings.\u201d Otherwise, it would have been forced to start selling its assets (which include supermarkets and offices across the UK) to raise funds. Analysts believe other funds will come under pressure too, if investors begin to worry that commercial property values are going to tumble in the aftermath of Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU. The move came just a couple of hours after the Bank of England took new steps to tackle the consequences of the Brexit vote. Britain\u2019s central bank relaxed the capital rules imposed on UK lenders, meaning firms and households will get access to an extra \u00a3150bn of potential credit. Banks, who met with chancellor George Osborne today, have just announced that they will make the extra capital available to the real economy. But Bank governor Mark Carney also issued a warning that the risks around Brexit are now \u2018starting to crystallise\u2019, \u201cThe UK has entered a period of uncertainty and significant economic adjustment. The efforts of the Bank of England will not be able fully and immediately to offset the market and economic volatility that can be expected while this adjustment proceeds.\u201d Carney also urged borrowers to be prudent, and warned that Britain\u2019s current account deficit with the rest of the world was a key risk in the post-Brexit world, as foreign investors may lose faith in the UK. Earlier, new economic data showed that UK service sector growth slowed last month. Fresh fears over Brexit are gripping the markets again. The pound has been rocked, hitting a new 31-year low around $1.305 against the US dollar. And the FTSE 250 index, which includes many small UK firms, is currently down 2.1% today. My colleague Jill Treanor has rattled out a Q&amp;A about Aviva and Standard Chartered\u2019s decision to block investors from cashing out of their property trusts. Here\u2019s a flavour: What are commercial property funds? They are funds that allow people to invest in commercial property developments such as office blocks and shopping centres \u2013 projects that normally rely on money from major professional investors. How much money is invested in them? Around \u00a335bn, around 7% of the total investment in UK commercial property, is invested in these property funds. Could this affect the residential property market? It is not immediately clear how this this feeds through into residential properties, although a hit to sentiment in the commercial property industry can quickly feed through to homebuyers, who might decide to pull out of transactions. The Bank of England is concerned that if these funds all seize up at once that it could amplify any fall in commercial property prices.... Could this affect the broader UK economy? Around75% of small businesses use commercial property as collateral for loans so they could face problems with their banks if prices fall too sharply. Banks also use commercial property to count towards their capital buffers; around 55% of their core capital \u2013 their main safety net in a crisis -\u2013 at the end of 2015 was based on commercial property.... More here: Earlier today, JP Morgan gave a pithy warning of the dangers of Brexit: Investors are bailing out of Britain\u2019s building and property companies today, as evidence mounts that Brexit fears are now hitting the sector. Housebuilders Barratt, Taylor Wimpey and Berkeley Group are leading the fallers on the blue-chip FTSE 100 index, down around 6% each. The FTSE 100 is still up a bit, thanks to the plunge in the pound (which helps big exporters). But Mark Carney told us this morning to watch the smaller FTSE 250 index instead, to see what the City really thinks about the UK economy. And that index has fallen by 2.5% this morning. Two challenger banks, Shawbrook and Virgin Money, have tumbled by 12% each. they are both acutely sensitive to UK consumer confidence, and spending. According to investment site Trustnet, the Aviva Property Trust holds commercial property assets across the UK. Roughly a third of its assets were in London and the South East (as of 31 May), including offices in the centre of the capital. It also owns shopping centres in Edinburgh, Manchester and Exeter, and offices in Birmingham. It will also have invested in shares of UK property companies, which have fallen sharply since the referendum. Here\u2019s our news story about Aviva locking down its UK property fund to prevent investors selling up, after the Brexit vote. Other property funds will probably come under pressure to follow Aviva and Standard Life\u2019s lead, if their customers decide to pull money out. Emma Bewley, head of funds at Connection Capital in London, told Bloomberg that: The potential impact of a high-profile liquid fund suspending redemptions shouldn\u2019t be underestimated, particularly given the uncertain environment. While asset managers will seek to avoid suspending redemptions, they may have to use additional liquidity facilities. Aviva has suspended redemptions from its property fund just three hours after the Bank of England spelt out the potential implications of such funds to the overall market. In its half-yearly assessment of risks to the financial markets, the Bank flagged up that: \u201cSince the referendum, share prices of UK real estate investment trust have fallen sharply, highlighting the risk of future adjustments in commercial retail estate prices. It then warned that: \u201cAny adjustment in commercial real estate markets could be amplified by the behaviour of leveraged investors and investors in open-ended commercial property funds. Any such amplification of market adjustments could affect economic activity by reducing the ability of companies that use commercial real state as collateral to access finance\u201d These funds account for 7% - or around \u00a335bn - of the investment in commercial property, and had already experienced significant outflows before the referendum. Commercial property prices matter because around 55% of their core capital bases are aligned to the loans in the sector and 75% of small businesses use commercial property as collateral for loans. It is the smaller banks which have greater exposure, the Bank said, after the major players reduced their exposure after the 2008 crisis. The Bank pointed out it had conducted stress tests in 2014 and 2015 on the major lenders to assume a 30% fall in property prices. Its own staff have calculated that for every 10% fall in commercial property prices there is a 1% fall in wider economic investment. The Financial Times has some good early reaction to Aviva\u2019s move: Mike Prew, analyst at Jefferies, the investment bank, said it was \u201cinevitable\u201d that further funds would halt redemptions in a \u201cvicious circle of value destruction\u201d that would also affect listed real estate investment trusts. A fund manager who monitors flows across the market said that outflows since the vote had been driven by discretionary wealth managers moving large chunks of investors\u2019 money into other asset classes. More here: Aviva becomes second UK property fund to halt redemptions Aviva and Standard Life are trying to protect the interests of all investors in their property funds by refusing to allow clients to take money out. Otherwise, they would be forced to sell property assets at firesale prices to fund redemption requests. That would drive down the value of the fund, encouraging more investors to cash out, creating a vicious circle. Instead, people with money in these funds must now sit and wait. The pound hasn\u2019t been this weak since September 1985: It has shed almost 2 cents today. Global traders are baulking at the news that two UK property trusts (so far) are now refusing to allow investors to pull their money out: Hat-tip to Giles Wilkes of the FT for the chart skills. Correction... the pound has actually fallen through $1.31 (so i\u2019ve updated that last entry). Aviva\u2019s decision to suspend its property trust has sent the pound reeling to a new 31-year low. Sterling slumped to $1.3098 against the US dollar, down 1.8 cents, to a level not seen since 1985. NEWSFLASH: Aviva, the savings and investment group, has suspended redemptions from its \u00a31.8bn property fund. It took the decision following the Brexit vote, which triggered a surge of requests from investors to pull their money out of its UK Property Trust. That\u2019s because the EU referendum could hurt the property sector, driving down the value of office blocks, supermarkets and factories. Aviva blamed \u201cextraordinary market circumstances\u201d, a day after Standard Life became the first firm to freeze its property fund. An Aviva spokesperson said: \u201cWe have acted to safeguard the interests of all our investors by suspending dealing in the fund with immediate effect. \u201cSuspension of dealing will give Aviva Investors greater control in managing cashflows and conducting orderly asset sales in order to meet our obligations to investors wishing to redeem their holdings.\u201d Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at City firm Hargreaves Lansdown, reckons more investment firms will freeze redemptions soon. \u2018The dominos are starting to fall in the UK commercial property market, as yet another fund locks its doors on the back of outflows precipitated by the Brexit vote. It\u2019s probably only a matter of time before we see other funds follow suit. George Osborne has repeated his support for Mark Carney\u2019s decision to ease the funding rules, allowing banks to lend more. He\u2019s told Sky News that the government\u2019s financial reforms, making the banks \u2018part of the solution in the UK economy, not part of the problem\u2019 are paying off. Economics professor David Blanchflower, a former Bank of England policymaker, has given Mark Carney full marks for today\u2019s performance: Resigning from high office (or not-so-high office) is in fashion this summer. So it\u2019s nice to see one senior official actually knuckling down and doing his job. Today\u2019s press conference had one key message \u2013 Britain\u2019s economy is suffering from the Brexit vote (as predicted), and its central bankers are on the case. 1) Bank of England governor Mark Carney has warned that the risks posed by the UK\u2019s referendum on EU membership have \u201cbegun to crystallise\u201d, and posing new dangers to the economy. Presenting the BoE\u2019s latest financial stability report, Carney said: The UK has entered a period of uncertainty and significant economic adjustment. The efforts of the Bank of England will not be able fully and immediately to offset the market and economic volatility that can be expected while this adjustment proceeds.\u201d 2) The BoE isn\u2019t sitting on its hands. Slashing the \u2018counter-cyclical capital reserves\u2019 will help banks to pump \u00a3150bn of extra lending into the economy. But Carney also warned that this will only work if businesses and individuals actually want to borrow. And despite the slide in the pound (which could help exporters), there are clear signs that the the economy is slowing. 3) Prudence used to be a Gordon Brown favourite, before the former chancellor and PM was engulfed by the financial crisis of 2007-08. But she has a new friend today. Asked for his advice to the UK, Carney declared that people must remain prudent: If you are taking out a mortgage, at some stage, during the life of that mortgage, conditions will be difficult. So you want to be sure, as a household or an individual, that you can repay that mortgage - you don\u2019t want to lose your house or flat. 4) The bank is watching closely for signs that Britain\u2019s most indebted households are struggling post-Brexit vote. There could be casualties out there... We have been concerned for some time about these issues,the interplay between high levels of household indebtedness and the housing market and the possibility that there will be more vulnerable households.\u201d 5) Carney reiterated that Britain\u2019s financial sector is in much better shape than before the financial crisis, so we should avoid another credit crunch. The core of this system is very strong, we may see some volatility, we may see things move around, but the system is going to be there for someone who wants to buy a house or a business person with a viable plan.\u201d 6) ....but the same can\u2019t be said of the current account deficit, which has widened to record levels. Carney warned that a weaker pound won\u2019t magically solve Britain\u2019s balance of payments woes (the fact we import more than we export). The danger is that overseas investors now shun the UK. In the governor\u2019s words: In and of itself, the movement in sterling should be beneficial for the current account. But... the pace of investment will also be quite important in terms of where the balance is going over time. 7) Carney has little time for those who point to the recovery in the FTSE 100 index (now above its pre-vote levels). It\u2019s better to look at the index of smaller firms, the FTSE 250 index, he says: \u201cIn terms of the equity markets I would focus a little bit more on the domestically-focused stock, the FTSE 250 or the component of FTSE 100 that is principally serving this economy. 8) Politics is for politicians. Carney was long rumoured to fancy a shift to Canadian politics, before a certain Justin Trudeau took the Liberal party to victory. Today he faces criticism from Leave campaigners, who will have their hands on (or at least near) the levers of power in the UK. But the governor brushed them aside, saying the Bank will keep doing its job and work with whoever is in power. Last question goes to my colleague Nils Pratley. He asks Mark Carney about the criticism piled on the Bank from Leave campaigners such as Andrea Leadsom (now in the running to become prime minister). Carney replies that \u201cwe\u2019re not asking people to make our lives easier\u201d This is a technocratic institution. We\u2019ll work with whoever is in government. In short, the Bank will keep sticking to its remit, publishing the reports expected under its remit. And that includes flagging up threats to the UK economy. That\u2019s the end of the press conference. Q: Could the Bank of England really ease monetary policy much lower - some economists suggest new quantitative easing (buying bonds with new money) wouldn\u2019t have much impact? Carney declines to comment on monetary policy \u2013 as today\u2019s meeting is about financial stability. Q: Is the Bank of England worried about the prospect of Scotland breaking away from the UK? That\u2019s a double hypothetical, Carney says - there\u2019s no 2nd referendum yet, let alone a decision. Back to the Bank of England press conference: Q: What discussions have you had with other central banks about the referendum? We have had close contact with them, Carney replies, especially in the run-up to the vote. This was effective in building mutual understanding of the risks posed by Brexit, he says. He points to the \u2018currency swaps\u2019 which allows central banks to share dollars, euros, pounds, yen etc with each other. And the global economy faces \u2018notable\u2019 spillovers, he adds. UK chancellor George Osborne has welcomed the BoE\u2019s decision to ease bank capital rules. He also reveals that major bank bosses are heading to his offices this morning, to discuss the crisis The decision to cut the counter-cyclical capital buffers is one of several Brexit u-turns, tweets The Sun\u2019s political editor: Hang on, though, didn\u2019t The Sun back Brexit??!! Some key points from Mark Carney\u2019s briefing: Q: Does the Bank of England actually have the capacity to handle Britain\u2019s exit from the EU? Mark Carney insists that yes, the BoE has the staff capacity to cope once Article 50 is triggered. But until that actually happens, the financial rules do not change. Q: How worried is the Bank about Standard Life\u2019s decision to lock down its property fund last night? (to prevent investors bailing out) Andrew Bailey, the next head of the FCA (the city watchdog), says Standard Life has taken a \u2018sensible move\u2019 to suspend redemptions. It prevents a stampede of money out of property funds while the underlying assets are revalued (which can take time). It would be wrong for investors at the front of the queue to get their money back, while those at the back lose out, Bailey says. The FCA is also in \u201cvery close touch\u201d with firms in the sector, he reveals. Q: How low could the Bank of England cut interest rates (they\u2019re currently 0.5%)? Carney declines to speculate much, as the Monetary Policy Committee is due to take a decision next week. Any measure to stimulate the economy must be well-aimed and focus on the domestic economy. We must also consider \u2018unintended consequences\u2019, he adds. [ultra-low interest rates make it hard for banks to achieve profitability, for example] Q: What impact will the slump in the pound have on the UK economy? Mark Carney says that it should help with Britain\u2019s current account deficit (reminder, it\u2019s worryingly high) Q: What is your advice to people who are wondering about taking out a loan or mortgage, asks our Jill Treanor? We are advising people to be prudent, governor Carney smiles. If you are taking out a mortgage, at some stage, during the life of that mortgage, conditions will be difficult. So you want to be sure, as a household or an individual, that you can repay that mortgage - you don\u2019t want to lose your house or flat. But this is classic central bank advice, he adds. We\u2019d tell you to be prudent if we were in the 10th year of a boom (whenever THAT happens) Carney says the Bank wants to avoid a repeat of the 2007-2008 conditions, when it was out of question to seek credit. Q: Do you regret allowing banks to pay dividends in the run-up to June\u2019s referendum? Mark Carney insists that UK banks are financially stable. Q: How many UK households are vulnerable to an economic slowdown? Carney flips this question to deputy governor Jon Cunliffe. Cunliffe says the Bank are watching the \u2018cohort\u2019 of vulnerable households closely. Households who are highly indebted tend to cut their consumption drastically, when hit by an interest rate shock or earnings shock, Cunliffe says. But the Bank did restrict the availability of high loan-to-value mortgages in 2014, to limit the number of highly vulnerable households, he adds. Q: Is the Bank worried about a crash in the buy-to-let market? Carney says the Bank is watching the buy-to-let sector carefully. He points out that the bank included a housing crash in its latest Stress Tests -- and the current environment is not a serious as modelled in those tests. The core of the UK financial system is very strong, and it will be there for home-buyers and businesses, he insists. Q: Is the Bank seeing signs of a slowdown in credit demand? Carney says this is a crucial point -- the credit market will be driven by demand, not supply. We are seeing signs that the environment is becoming more \u2018risk averse\u2019, he says. And that\u2019s why the Bank has decided to relax credit rules, to encourage banks to lend. But demand for credit will be governed by the level of uncertainty over Britain\u2019s future, and its relationship with the EU. Q: The Monetary Policy Committee warned that Britain might fall into recession after a Brexit vote, but might the fall in the pound actually be a stimulus? Carney replies that there is \u201cgrowing evidence\u201d that the economy was slowing, even before the referendum. And it is probably experiencing a \u201cmaterial slowing\u201d, despite the foreign exchange moves. Onto questions Q: The FTSE 100 has recovered its early post-Brexit falls and the pound has stabilised, so aren\u2019t markets less stressed than feared? Mark Carney replies that markets are functioning \u201cpretty well\u201d, although sterling volatility did hit a record high. He says sterling has moved in the way that was \u201cnecessary\u201d to allow the economic adjustment that is needed. [by which he means that a cheaper pound should help exporters and cut imports, in theory.....] Governor Carney adds that the FTSE 250 index gives a sense of investor expectations on the direction of the economy. [The FTSE 250, which contains smaller companies, has fallen much more than the FTSE 100, and is down 2.6% today] Mark Carney says there will be no immediate changes to UK financial regulations, until Britain has actually left the EU. The law is the law, and the rules are the rules. He is pledging to take whatever action is needed ensure monetary stability, and support the real economy. But the Bank can only do so much..... Mark Carney confirms that the Bank of England has decided to cut the \u2018counter-cyclical capital buffer\u2019 on UK banks. This means banks need to keep less capital on their books, and can pump up to \u00a3150bn more into the economy. This will \u201cimmediately\u201d give banks greater flexibility to lend to UK businesses and households, declares the BoE governor. He adds: Those businesses and households who want to seize viable opportunities in the post-Brexit world can be confident that they will be supported by the financial sector. Carney also declares that regulators will make sure that banks don\u2019t use this flexibility to boost bonus payments, or dividends. Mark Carney begins his press conference by reminding us that the Bank identified the referendum as the biggest threat to the UK economy. That warning is now being borne out, the governor says, pointing to the plunge in the pound since June 23rd. He singles out UK\u2019s current account deficit (as mentioned a few minutes ago). There is growing evidence that the referendum has delayed major investment decisions, Carney adds. But on the upside, financial markets have responded well to the volatility after the referendum result, rather than adding to stress. And banks are much better capitalised than before the Lehman crisis. The Financial Stability Report press conference is beginning now. We\u2019ve added a live feed to the top of this blog - you might need to refresh to see it. Alternatively, It\u2019s also being livestreamed here (right-click to open in a new tab). You can see the report yourself, here: Financial Stability Report, July 2016 More snap reaction: The Bank of England is also concerned about the United Kingdom\u2019s large current account deficit, following the Brexit vote. This deficit, between what Britain imports and exports, is \u201chigh by historical and international standards\u201d, says the Bank. Indeed.... --&gt; The Bank is worried that the flow of capital into the UK could now slow, making this deficit even bigger.... The financing of the deficit is reliant on continuing material inflows of portfolio and foreign direct investment, which have been used to finance the public sector deficit and corporate investment, including in commercial real estate. A sudden shift in the supply of foreign capital and in the current account deficit would be associated with a sharp increase in risk premia and adjustment in sterling. The BoE also points out the pound suffered a record fall after the referendum vote: . The Bank of England has also warned Britain\u2019s banks not to splurge cash on payments to shareholders, or bonuses to staff: Newsflash from London: Britain\u2019s central bank has warned that the risks posed by the Brexit vote are \u201cstarting to crystallise\u201d. In it latest financial stability report, just released, the Bank of England warns that: \u201cThere is evidence that some risks have begun to crystallise. The current outlook for UK financial stability is challenging,\u201d The BoE has also taken action to fight the looming threat of recession, by relaxing the capital control rules on UK banks. That is meant to encourage lenders to keep providing credit to the UK economy. Back in March, the BoE has announced that the so-called counter-cyclical capital buffer would rise to 0.5%. It has now reversed that decision, potentially freeing up an extra \u00a3150bn for lending, the BoE said. And the Bank also pledged to do more to help the economy, saying: \u201cThe Financial Policy Committee stands ready to take actions that will ensure that capital and liquidity buffers can be drawn on as needed, to support the supply of credit and in support of market functioning.\u201d We\u2019ll hear more from governor Mark Carney at 11am. In five minutes, the Bank of England will publish its latest Financial Stability report...and may just announce some measures to prop up the UK economy (as explained earlier) Mark Priest of ETX Capital says Standard Life\u2019s decision to freeze its property fund last night has spooked the City, and helped to drive down the pound. Standard Life\u2019s decision to close redemptions on its open-ended property fund is vitally important and shows just how precarious the situation is right now. This seems to have precipitated some pretty big selling in property stocks and asset managers, with Legal &amp; General and Aberdeen Asset Management suffering nasty falls this morning. Barratt Developments and Taylor Wimpey are down 5% again. Investors are getting very nervous now as they fear Standard Life may not be the only fund that will close its doors. The last time we saw this kind of action was in the financial crisis. Bad news for British holidaymakers....sterling has also hit a two-and-a-half-year low against the euro, at \u20ac1.1787. The last time the pound was this low, in 1985, David Bowie and Mick Jagger were topping the charts with Dancing In The Streets. If the pound loses another cent, we\u2019ll be back to 1984 levels, when Frankie Goes To Hollywood were encouraging the nation to Relax. Click on this tweet to see more.... Boom! The pound just hit a new 31-year low against the US dollar. Sterling slumped by 1.5 cents to $1.3113 following the news that UK service sector growth was hit by Brexit angst last month. That\u2019s below the levels hit after the referendum vote, and back to the sterling crisis of the mid-1980s. Analysts are concerned that growth in Britain\u2019s dominant services sector slowed last month, but relieved that it didn\u2019t actually contract: Economist Rupert Seggins has helpfully put the service sector report into context: Breaking! Growth in Britain\u2019s service sector has hit a joint-38-month low, indicating that economic growth has slowed. Data firm Markit reports the UK\u2019s services companies suffered a fall in new business last month. And employment rose at the slowest rate since August 2013. It\u2019s the latest sign that Brexit uncertainty has hurt the economy, even before the vote itself (89% of the survey was conducted before June 24) Markit reports: Growth over the second quarter as a whole was the weakest since the first quarter of 2013 when the current upturn began. Moreover, the 12-month outlook was the darkest since December 2012. Companies often reported that uncertainty linked to the EU referendum had weighed on workloads and incoming new business. This dragged the service sector PMI down to 52.3 in June, down from 53.5 in May. That matches April\u2019s 38-month low and signals a relatively weak rate of growth in UK services output. On the upside, it\u2019s still above the 50-point figure that splits expansion from contraction (yesterday, the construction PMI plunged to just 46) But....it suggests Britain\u2019s economy weakened in the last three months. And there could be worse to come. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, explains: \u201cThe PMI surveys indicate that the pace of UK economic growth slowed to just 0.2% in the second quarter, with a further loss of momentum in June as Brexit anxiety intensified. \u201cHiring has also clearly been hit as firms lack clarity on the economic outlook. Business optimism in the vast service sector is down to a three-and-a-half-year low. \u201cA further slowing, and possible contraction, looks highly likely in coming months as a result of the uncertainty created by the EU referendum. Shares in UK property firms are sliding this morning. Investors are racing for the hills, after Standard Life froze redemptions from its \u00a32.9bn property fund last night following a surge of redemption requests after the Brexit vote. Building firms Taylor Wimpey, Berkeley Group and Barratt Developments are all down 6%. Persimmon are close behind (-5.7%) despite telling the City this morning that it is still confidence about its prospects. Land Securities, one of the UK\u2019s largest commercial property owners, has fallen 5%. Kit Juckes of French bank Societe Generale says \u201cthe mood has soured again\u201d. The announcement that fund manager Standard Life had stopped retail investors from pulling out of one of the largest UK property funds is one catalyst for the downturn in sentiment, though not the only one. Concerns about Italian banks are growing, too. Just in....growth in Europe\u2019s service sector slowed last month, as firms watched Britain head to the polls in the EU referendum. The eurozone services PMI, which measures activity across the sector, has fallen to 52.8 in June, down from 53.3 in May. That\u2019s the lowest reading since January 2015. Germany had another good month, with its services sector PMI rising to 53.7 from 53.2. Italy\u2019s service sector returned to growth, with the PMI jumping to 51.9 from 49.8. But France\u2019s private sector contracted again. And if you factor in the latest manufacturing data, you see that growth has dropped to its weakest level since the last quarter of 2014: Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, fears the eurozone economy is faltering. \u201cThe eurozone economy failed to gain momentum in June, rounding off a disappointing second quarter. Faster manufacturing growth was countered by a slowdown in the service sector, leaving the overall pace of expansion of business activity unchanged since May. \u201cThe survey is signalling GDP growth of just 0.3%, similar to the sluggish trend recorded over the past year. The data suggest that the strong upturn seen in the official GDP data at the start of the year will have overstated the underlying health of the economy, and that growth will have slowed in the second quarter. And that\u2019s before the Brexit shock.... Jeremy Cook, chief economist at currency trading firm World First, agrees that Mark Carney is likely to relax capital rules today, following the Brexit vote. But he also fears that banks might not lend more to customers. Here\u2019s why: Mark Carney\u2019s Bank of England is expected to flex the muscles of their newest counter-cyclical capital buffer today and lower the levels of capital banks are forced to hold in their coffers. This should allow banks to increase the volume of loans they\u2019re extending to the private sector as they look to put the capital to work which, in turn, supports the credit markets and small businesses reliant on bank funding. However, history isn\u2019t particularly supportive of this theory. Mervyn King\u2019s Bank of England had a torrid time trying to get UK banks to issue credit for one key reason \u2013 the demand for loans simply wasn\u2019t there. In times of political and economic uncertainty, appetite for credit among SMEs falls through the floor, and understandably so. Dan Davies of Frontline Analysts reckons the markets look pretty edgy, given the drops on the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250. Nervous investors are piling into the Swiss government debt this morning, in their search for a safe haven. They have driven prices to record highs. And amazingly, the yield on 50-year Swiss debt is now negative -- meaning investors are paying for the chance to lend to Bern until 2066! All is not well out there..... European stock markets are falling in early trading, as investors fret about the global economy. The French and German indices are both down around 1%. London\u2019s FTSE 100 is only down 0.3%, thanks to the weakening pound (which helps internationally-focused firms). But the smaller FTSE 250 has lost 1.8% in early trading, following a 2% slide yesterday. Confidence among British businesses fell sharply following the vote to leave the European Union, according to a new survey. Almost 50% of firms are now pessimistic about the UK economy, the survey by YouGov and the Centre for Economics and Business Research found. That\u2019s up from 25% before the referendum. It suggests that Britain has suffered \u201ca significant shock reaction (to Brexit),\u201d according to Scott Corfe, director at Cebr. He adds: \u201cNot only are businesses feeling much more pessimistic in general about the state of the economy, but their own expectations for domestic sales, exports and investments over the next 12 months have gone off a cliff.\u201d This will alarm the Bank of England, and encourage policymakers to consider measure to prevent the UK falling into recession. The pound is dropping in early trading, as investors await the Bank of England\u2019s financial stability report. Sterling has dropped by over one cent, to $1.3174 against the US dollar. That\u2019s not far from the 31-year low plumbed after the Brexit vote ($1.3118 is the magic number). In theory, a weak pound is good for exporters -- but only if demand for their products isn\u2019t dented by a global downturn. And it won\u2019t fix the UK economy\u2019s underlying weaknesses.... Cometh the hour, cometh the man, again?.... With Brexit fears gripping Britain\u2019s economy, the public and the City are crying out for guidance and help. So as Westminster is rather pre-occupied by leadership contests, the responsibility will fall to Bank of England governor Mark Carney today. The BoE will released its latest Financial Stability report at 10.30am this morning, assessing the state of the UK\u2019s economy. It looks rather more unstable than two weeks ago, of course, since the EU referendum vote turned politics on its head, and put business confidence on its knees. Then at 11am, Carney will hold a press conference to explain the Bank\u2019s thinking, and any new measures it is taking to tackle the crisis. This will be Carney\u2019s second set piece event in a week; last Thursday, he all-but promised interest rate cuts and more stimulus measures this summer. So what could he do today? The Bank could choose to relax the capital rules imposed on banks, to give them more leeway to handle the fallout from Brexit. That would be a symbolic move to ease pressures on the City; it\u2019s only six months since the BoE tightened those rules, which are meant to protect us from a financial crisis. Carney could also signal that more credit will be thrown at the economy, by beefing up the existing Funding for Lending. That would also help to prevent a credit crunch clogging up the economy. Here\u2019s our preview: There are already signs that last month\u2019s referendum is having a damaging impact on the economy. As we liveblogged last night, Standard Life has been forced to stop investors withdrawing from its real estate fund, after being deluged by redemption requests. That may herald some nasty times in the property sector.... Also coming up today.... We get a flurry of economic data today, showing how service sector companies in the UK, the eurozone and America performed in June. Analysts will be looking for signs that the Brexit crisis hit growth, after some shockingly weak construction data yesterday 9am BST: Eurozone service sector PMI 9.30am BST: UK services sector PMI 2.45pm BST: US ISM service sector report 3pm BST: US factory orders. And in the City, building firm Persimmon and brewery chain Young &amp; Co are reporting results.",

It will be delivered on Wednesday, and it is hoped it will offer a comprehensive account of the path to war in 2003. Philippe Sands QC, author of Lawless World, told the Observer the 2.6m-word report must detail \u201cprecisely what went wrong, why it went wrong and who were the key players in making it go wrong, so that lessons will be learned that will allow us to make sure it never happens again\u201d.

Last week, Ontario said it would allow the use of a third gender indicator, X, for driver\u2019s licenses. Last month, Canada relaxed restrictions on gay men donating blood. Trudeau called the move \u201cpart of the great arc of history sweeping towards justice\u201d.

Murray has beaten Kyrgios four times out of four on the tour but the Australian\u2019s game \u2013 and career \u2013 is in the ascendant. In his previous match, Kyrgios, the 15th seed, criticised supporters in his box for failing to be sufficiently enthusiastic and was heard to label some of them \u201cretarded\u201d.

We remember our roots and value the diversity of our communities. </p> <p>In Winnipeg, we may have extremely cold weather in the winter, but there are so many ways to embrace it - skating on the frozen river under the stars, cross-country skiing, or attending the French-Canadian Festival du Voyageur in February, where you can admire world-class ice sculpture. And don\u2019t get me started about the summers, which are hot and beautiful. Exploring Manitoba\u2019s many lakes on canoe trips or while staying at a cabin for a weekend is the closest you\u2019ll ever get to pure happiness.<br></p> <p>I think it\u2019s a bit funny sometimes how little a conception of Canada\u2019s vastness people seem to have. It\u2019s not very feasible for most Canadians to travel across the country, much less take skiing holidays at Banff all the time. There\u2019s a big disconnect between the tourist\u2019s version of Canada and the local communities most of us live in. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"74a9a3aaf19335f29f144c4b3e450783f4c4b8f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74a9a3aaf19335f29f144c4b3e450783f4c4b8f4/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Winnipeg skyline with Canadian Museum for Human Rights and Esplanade Riel Bridge\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Winnipeg skyline with Canadian Museum for Human Rights and Esplanade Riel Bridge</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><em><strong>\u2018This is a very happy place to be </strong></em>day in, day out<em><strong>\u2019 - </strong><strong>Gavin Schofield, Banff, Alberta</strong></em><br></h2> <p>Living in Banff National Park and working as a bartender is something quite special. I will never tire of being surrounded by the jagged Rocky Mountains. There also seems to be a great acceptance of different cultures and that instills a real sense of community which enforces this \u2018friendly identity\u2019 that Canadians are labelled with.A lot depends on the individual, but this is a very happy place to be day in and day out.</p> <p>I\u2019d like to see more positive changes in the near future stemming from the government in terms of the climate change and free movement debates. However, not a great deal needs or can be done to make Canada a more appealing place to live.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a9ca8f26a550fb0809a94a6f14d8d2ec9d774fb7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9ca8f26a550fb0809a94a6f14d8d2ec9d774fb7/0_0_5301_3588/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Skoki Cabin at Banff National Park\" width=\"1000\" height=\"677\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Skoki Cabin at Banff National Park</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jerry Kobalenko/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><em><strong>\u2018The first thing I do when I return home is lose myself in the nearest woods\u2019 - Jennie Wright, Ontario</strong></em></h2> <p>There are two Canadas -one is the one-hundred-mile-wide strip on the southern border where 75% of the population lives, and the other is everywhere else. A couple of hours\u2019 drive brings southern Canadians into the vast areas so sparsely populated by the other 25%. Once out of that southern fringe, we can hike, canoe, snowshoe, snowmobile and ride through the rest of wild Canada without ever relying on motorways and public footpaths. I love travelling to the UK, but must admit that the fact that most land is privately owned makes me feel claustrophobic. The first thing I do when I return home is lose myself in the nearest woods. </p> <p>But Canada has its fare share of problems too. The dismantling of a national housing program has resulted in skyrocketing homelessness. The proportion of the population relying on food banks and other forms of social assistance continues to climb. Grants for post-secondary education were abolished long ago and many students face poor job prospects and crippling debt. The aboriginal population continues to face discrimination and exploitation. Our armed forces have been redirected from peacekeeping missions to often misguided combat missions. </p> <p>On the other hand, LGBTQ rights are among the strongest in the world. We can drive, cycle, and canoe from sea to sea. Our schools consistently rank as world-class, our cities are clean, and we\u2019re getting better at urban transportation and green technology. Many Canadians are bilingual or trilingual, and our culture is vibrant and dynamic.<br></p> <p>As an elementary teacher<strong> </strong>in southern Ontario I always wish for more investment in public education. Public education, especially for special needs students, continues to come under attack across Canada. In Ontario most specialised elementary teaching positions like librarians, music and PE teachers were removed in the nineties. I would like to see our schools adequately funded and grants available again to low-income students who wish to pursue secondary studies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"74a570f1d690760e8d7fae63832a21611e8260dc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74a570f1d690760e8d7fae63832a21611e8260dc/0_0_1200_800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Moose Lake, Ontario\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Moose Lake, Ontario</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Derek Bernat/GuardianWitness</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><em>\u2018There is always a place where anyone can feel at home\u2019 - Peter McClure, Edmonton, Alberta</em></strong></h2> <p>It seems as if Canada is one of the few countries in then world that has consistently been accepting of new immigrants. Perhaps it\u2019s just because we have so much space, but I think that speaks to a feeling of \u201clive and let live\u201d and a rather relaxed, tolerant, and humanistic approach to life, that doesn\u2019t seem to be shared elsewhere in quite the same way. It might also be that we have so many environments within our country that we assume there is always a place where anyone can feel at home. Anyone who isn\u2019t content where they are can easily move to a place they find more exciting, or more peaceful, or more scenic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"290984b91b1f9238c53f49b8cf0bb29895900a4b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/290984b91b1f9238c53f49b8cf0bb29895900a4b/0_0_743_960/387.jpg\" alt=\"Spotting some bald eagles on BC\u2019s coast, Tofino, a wonder secluded end of the road town\" width=\"387\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spotting some bald eagles on BC\u2019s coast, Tofino, a wonder secluded end of the road town</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Cook/GuardianWitness</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It may be that some of that tolerance comes from the fact that the country was formed originally by combining two different cultures. There will always be a few who complain about how Quebec has too many rights, or how the English are taking over French culture, but at least no one starts panicking if they hear someone speaking another language.</p> <p>The wilderness is all around and within easy reach. There are few Canadians who haven\u2019t been camping, and it is even said that a Canadian is someone who knows how to make love in a canoe. One thing that makes us unique is our familiarity with the outdoors, and it is certainly part of our national character. </p> <p>Unfortunately, we are all too prone to identify ourselves in a negative way by comparing ourselves to our southern neighbour. It is too easy to say that \u201cAt least we don\u2019t carry guns\u201d or \u201cThank goodness we don\u2019t have to worry about getting sick.\u201d We are continuously bombarded by American media, and that means we often know more about their country than our own</p> <p>I believe it is crucial that Canada take a good, long look at who we are and what we want to become as a country. Like the mouse who sleeps beside the elephant, we are at risk of having our culture accidentally crushed. It is the sheer ubiquity of American culture that threatens to overwhelm us, and while having the United States on hand as a role model to be rejected helps us understand how different we are, there is a growing tendency to believe that we are really just Americans, but with healthcare instead of guns.</p> <h2><em><strong>\u2018Here I have space to think and breathe\u2019 - Dr. Beth Green, Hamilton</strong></em></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"e3389d87cde9d094c0d2ed76fe9e13d89bdf8897\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e3389d87cde9d094c0d2ed76fe9e13d89bdf8897/0_0_894_1157/773.jpg\" alt=\"Beth Green\" width=\"773\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beth Green</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Beth Green</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I left a stressful academic job in the UK.

I\u2019ve been here just over a year and the first year was a massive adventure, the reality of the big move is bound to settle in come year two.</p> <p>I do think Canada needs a better language to speak about immigration. Although it prides itself on welcoming immigrants, I\u2019m conscious that it\u2019s easier for people like me who are white and educated. I think the immigration system her is under unprecedented strain and the cracks are beginning to show.</p> <h2><em><strong>\u2018Canada\u2019s geography is both a blessing and a challenge\u2019 - </strong></em><strong><em>Lucas Kilravey, Toronto, Ontario</em></strong></h2> <p>While most other countries are ambivalent at best, Canada has largely embraced this dynamic of constantly changing pluralism as part of its identity. Canada is very unusual in the world in its relaxed, even positive, attitude toward very large numbers of immigrants. It seems that Canada is casually moving toward a very advanced stage of cosmopolitanism while much of the world is increasingly riven by nationalism. That seems, to me, rather unique. But as our population and economy grow, and our democracy matures in a unique direction, we need to more willing to lead by example instead of leaving the complicated problems to other countries.</p> <p>Canada enjoys many benefits, both in terms of economics and security, by being so close to the United States. We benefit greatly from fluid access to the wealth and innovation of America\u2019s rather remarkable market and society.<br></p> <p>Canada\u2019s geography is both a blessing and a challenge. Our low population over such a large territory gives rise to some quite objectionable provincialism. We must manage this by making internal travel more accessible and affordable. Internal airfares are such that, when I go on vacation, it is often cheaper to go to Europe than to fly to Vancouver. We also need to invest in high speed rail across the country. I hope PM Trudeau\u2019s infrastructure funding will be visionary in this regard.<br></p> <p>Canada must address the legacy of genocide against the Aboriginal people. It is absolutely necessary to address the dissonance between the things about Canada that we value and the brutal way the Aboriginal people have been treated.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a045977d25e3e92efe982463ee24f1bbc91c91f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a045977d25e3e92efe982463ee24f1bbc91c91f8/0_0_1200_738/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sunset over Downtown VancouverThe West Coast of British Columbia is blessed with the fact that it is, well, a coast, with the ocean running along it.

Europe is afflicted with a kind of uncomfortable accommodation that seems to be stuck at the point where they can start to question the dominance of traditional national groups. Canada is basically uninterested in nationalism, and that seems to make it much easier to work together in a way that minimises the sense of native-born privilege. And that in turn has made it easier to address the terrible failings in these areas, and in how brutally we\u2019ve treated first nations people. We are deeply flawed, and have a history that we can\u2019t ignore, but I think we lack anxiety about opening that up for examination.<br></p> <p>Politically Canada has committed to so many economically terrible policies over the past decade or two, and extricating ourselves is going to be a lot more complex than the glibness Justin Trudeau suggests. On the other hand, Canada is in many ways what it seems to be \u2013 civil, concerned with social good, the environment and minority rights. But we need to sort out our failed relationship with the environment. The fossil fuel energy sector has to go. We\u2019ve shamed ourselves so terribly, but it has brought into focus how important the perspective of those who have remained connected to the land.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"913c8b6924316f5a98d35f3c3f4e28c988076836\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/913c8b6924316f5a98d35f3c3f4e28c988076836/0_0_1200_798/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Early morning at Jasper Park Lodge.

But as an Indigenous person, I have a different view of Canada than many. More than 75 per cent of Canadians live within 100 kilometres of the USA border. The country uses Indigenous communities to hold on to much of its land, while begrudging the existence and cost of those communities. Nobody says that English people practicing English language and law in England equals \u201cspecial status\u201d.

Living in Ontario I can drive 3 hours from my house and be on a lake in a huge protected wilderness area with no one in sight.

          "bodyText": "\u2018I appreciate more about Canada the more I travel elsewhere\u2019 - Julienne Isaacs, Winnipeg, Manitoba There\u2019s always an exception to the rule, but most Canadians are genuinely kind, open to difference and welcoming to strangers. We remember our roots and value the diversity of our communities. In Winnipeg, we may have extremely cold weather in the winter, but there are so many ways to embrace it - skating on the frozen river under the stars, cross-country skiing, or attending the French-Canadian Festival du Voyageur in February, where you can admire world-class ice sculpture. And don\u2019t get me started about the summers, which are hot and beautiful. Exploring Manitoba\u2019s many lakes on canoe trips or while staying at a cabin for a weekend is the closest you\u2019ll ever get to pure happiness. I think it\u2019s a bit funny sometimes how little a conception of Canada\u2019s vastness people seem to have. It\u2019s not very feasible for most Canadians to travel across the country, much less take skiing holidays at Banff all the time. There\u2019s a big disconnect between the tourist\u2019s version of Canada and the local communities most of us live in. \u2018This is a very happy place to be day in, day out\u2019 - Gavin Schofield, Banff, Alberta Living in Banff National Park and working as a bartender is something quite special. I will never tire of being surrounded by the jagged Rocky Mountains. There also seems to be a great acceptance of different cultures and that instills a real sense of community which enforces this \u2018friendly identity\u2019 that Canadians are labelled with.A lot depends on the individual, but this is a very happy place to be day in and day out. I\u2019d like to see more positive changes in the near future stemming from the government in terms of the climate change and free movement debates. However, not a great deal needs or can be done to make Canada a more appealing place to live. \u2018The first thing I do when I return home is lose myself in the nearest woods\u2019 - Jennie Wright, Ontario There are two Canadas -one is the one-hundred-mile-wide strip on the southern border where 75% of the population lives, and the other is everywhere else. A couple of hours\u2019 drive brings southern Canadians into the vast areas so sparsely populated by the other 25%. Once out of that southern fringe, we can hike, canoe, snowshoe, snowmobile and ride through the rest of wild Canada without ever relying on motorways and public footpaths. I love travelling to the UK, but must admit that the fact that most land is privately owned makes me feel claustrophobic. The first thing I do when I return home is lose myself in the nearest woods. But Canada has its fare share of problems too. The dismantling of a national housing program has resulted in skyrocketing homelessness. The proportion of the population relying on food banks and other forms of social assistance continues to climb. Grants for post-secondary education were abolished long ago and many students face poor job prospects and crippling debt. The aboriginal population continues to face discrimination and exploitation. Our armed forces have been redirected from peacekeeping missions to often misguided combat missions. On the other hand, LGBTQ rights are among the strongest in the world. We can drive, cycle, and canoe from sea to sea. Our schools consistently rank as world-class, our cities are clean, and we\u2019re getting better at urban transportation and green technology. Many Canadians are bilingual or trilingual, and our culture is vibrant and dynamic. As an elementary teacher in southern Ontario I always wish for more investment in public education. Public education, especially for special needs students, continues to come under attack across Canada. In Ontario most specialised elementary teaching positions like librarians, music and PE teachers were removed in the nineties. I would like to see our schools adequately funded and grants available again to low-income students who wish to pursue secondary studies. \u2018There is always a place where anyone can feel at home\u2019 - Peter McClure, Edmonton, Alberta It seems as if Canada is one of the few countries in then world that has consistently been accepting of new immigrants. Perhaps it\u2019s just because we have so much space, but I think that speaks to a feeling of \u201clive and let live\u201d and a rather relaxed, tolerant, and humanistic approach to life, that doesn\u2019t seem to be shared elsewhere in quite the same way. It might also be that we have so many environments within our country that we assume there is always a place where anyone can feel at home. Anyone who isn\u2019t content where they are can easily move to a place they find more exciting, or more peaceful, or more scenic. It may be that some of that tolerance comes from the fact that the country was formed originally by combining two different cultures. There will always be a few who complain about how Quebec has too many rights, or how the English are taking over French culture, but at least no one starts panicking if they hear someone speaking another language. The wilderness is all around and within easy reach. There are few Canadians who haven\u2019t been camping, and it is even said that a Canadian is someone who knows how to make love in a canoe. One thing that makes us unique is our familiarity with the outdoors, and it is certainly part of our national character. Unfortunately, we are all too prone to identify ourselves in a negative way by comparing ourselves to our southern neighbour. It is too easy to say that \u201cAt least we don\u2019t carry guns\u201d or \u201cThank goodness we don\u2019t have to worry about getting sick.\u201d We are continuously bombarded by American media, and that means we often know more about their country than our own I believe it is crucial that Canada take a good, long look at who we are and what we want to become as a country. Like the mouse who sleeps beside the elephant, we are at risk of having our culture accidentally crushed. It is the sheer ubiquity of American culture that threatens to overwhelm us, and while having the United States on hand as a role model to be rejected helps us understand how different we are, there is a growing tendency to believe that we are really just Americans, but with healthcare instead of guns. \u2018Here I have space to think and breathe\u2019 - Dr. Beth Green, Hamilton I left a stressful academic job in the UK. Here I have space to think and breathe and start over working as a researcher. The grass always looks greener on the other side. I\u2019ve been here just over a year and the first year was a massive adventure, the reality of the big move is bound to settle in come year two. I do think Canada needs a better language to speak about immigration. Although it prides itself on welcoming immigrants, I\u2019m conscious that it\u2019s easier for people like me who are white and educated. I think the immigration system her is under unprecedented strain and the cracks are beginning to show. \u2018Canada\u2019s geography is both a blessing and a challenge\u2019 - Lucas Kilravey, Toronto, Ontario While most other countries are ambivalent at best, Canada has largely embraced this dynamic of constantly changing pluralism as part of its identity. Canada is very unusual in the world in its relaxed, even positive, attitude toward very large numbers of immigrants. It seems that Canada is casually moving toward a very advanced stage of cosmopolitanism while much of the world is increasingly riven by nationalism. That seems, to me, rather unique. But as our population and economy grow, and our democracy matures in a unique direction, we need to more willing to lead by example instead of leaving the complicated problems to other countries. Canada enjoys many benefits, both in terms of economics and security, by being so close to the United States. We benefit greatly from fluid access to the wealth and innovation of America\u2019s rather remarkable market and society. Canada\u2019s geography is both a blessing and a challenge. Our low population over such a large territory gives rise to some quite objectionable provincialism. We must manage this by making internal travel more accessible and affordable. Internal airfares are such that, when I go on vacation, it is often cheaper to go to Europe than to fly to Vancouver. We also need to invest in high speed rail across the country. I hope PM Trudeau\u2019s infrastructure funding will be visionary in this regard. Canada must address the legacy of genocide against the Aboriginal people. It is absolutely necessary to address the dissonance between the things about Canada that we value and the brutal way the Aboriginal people have been treated. \u2018Canada is basically uninterested in nationalism, and that seems to make it much easier to work together\u2019 - Dan Donaldson, Elora, Ontario Canada is the place where a truly multicultural society manages to feel completely normal. Europe is afflicted with a kind of uncomfortable accommodation that seems to be stuck at the point where they can start to question the dominance of traditional national groups. Canada is basically uninterested in nationalism, and that seems to make it much easier to work together in a way that minimises the sense of native-born privilege. And that in turn has made it easier to address the terrible failings in these areas, and in how brutally we\u2019ve treated first nations people. We are deeply flawed, and have a history that we can\u2019t ignore, but I think we lack anxiety about opening that up for examination.

But we need to sort out our failed relationship with the environment. The fossil fuel energy sector has to go. We\u2019ve shamed ourselves so terribly, but it has brought into focus how important the perspective of those who have remained connected to the land. \u2018As an Indigenous person, I have a different view of Canada than many\u2019 - Ursa Minor, Winnipeg I agree that Canada is a nice place given how much land there is and how scattered the people are across that vast landscape.

A second model that incorporates economic statistics and historical data portrays a slightly tighter race, 73.6%-26.4%. A \u201cnow-cast\u201d \u2013 who would win the election today? \u2013 has the race at 86%-14% for Clinton.</p> <p><strong>Why credit what Nate Silver thinks</strong>? Because in 2008 he predicted 49 of 50 states correctly (missing Obama\u2019s squeaker Indiana win) and all the Senate races correctly, and in 2012 he predicted 50 of 50 states correctly. Silver\u2019s 2012 call was especially sweet because he predicted a blowout 332-206 electoral college victory for Obama when a lot of other loud people said the president was in a close reelection fight with Mitt Romney. They were wrong, Silver was right.</p> <p><strong>Why discount what Nate Silver thinks</strong>? Because in August <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/podcast-totally-subjective-presidential-odds-early-august-edition/\">he gave Trump a 2% chance</a> of winning the Republican nomination, in March FiveThirtyEight\u2019s <a href=\"http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/primary-forecast/michigan-democratic/\">model</a> gave Clinton a 99% chance of winning the Michigan primary (Bernie Sanders won by a half-point) and in the 2014 midterms he failed to anticipate a Republican wave that created multiple upsets of FiveThirtyEight\u2019s modeling (\u201cthe polls did have a strong bias this year,\u201d Silver <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-polls-were-skewed-toward-democrats/\">wrote</a> afterward). </p> <p>Caveat lector. Here\u2019s what Nate Silver thinks this year:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/748220927117242369\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Hey y&#39;all our 2016 forecast is here. <a href=\"https://t.co/WLXtJovjYd\">https://t.co/WLXtJovjYd</a></p>&mdash; Nate Silver (@NateSilver538) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/748220927117242369\">June 29, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The model rates the election in each state. For a sense of Clinton\u2019s advantage at this point, consider the 12 tightest state races in FiveThirtyEight\u2019s model. Trump could win them all \u2013 and Clinton would still win the presidency, so long as she won the 13th tossup state, Florida. </p> <p>The model has Pennsylvania at +7 for the Democrat with Clinton having an 85.9% chance of winning. The model has Arizona, which should be a Republican shoe-in, basically tied with a slight edge for Clinton. The model has North Carolina, Iowa, Colorado, Ohio, New Hampshire and Florida all leaning toward Clinton. The model really stinks for Trump.</p> <p>There\u2019s an entertaining section that awards probabilities for \u201ccrazy and not-so-crazy scenarios\u201d. For example the model thinks that Trump has a 90.6% chance of winning at least one state Obama won in 2012; keep your eye on Colorado, Iowa and New Hampshire. The model puts the probability of a \u201cClinton landslide\u201d at 29.2%.</p> <p>Here\u2019s how the basic FiveThirtyEight map looks (but <a href=\"http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/#now\">click through</a> for their real map, which captures varying strengths, state-to-state, of redness and blueness):</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"map\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.270towin.com/maps/azB7w&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.270towin.com/presidential_map_new/maps/azB7w.png&quot; width=&quot;460&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;vertical-align: middle;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.270towin.com/uploads/3rd_party_270_30px.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt; Click the map to create your own at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.270towin.com/maps/azB7w&quot;&gt;270toWin.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s the kind of map that would deliver on David Plouffe\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/jun/29/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-campaign-ads-us-election?page=with:block-5773f795e4b0759da0f94c12#block-5773f795e4b0759da0f94c12\">prediction</a> of 350+ electoral votes for Clinton.

A <a href=\"http://www.qu.edu/news-and-events/quinnipiac-university-poll/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2363\">new Quinnipiac poll</a> <strong>has the presidential race neck-and-neck</strong>, with Hillary Clinton at 42% and Donald Trump at 40%, and a margin of error of +/- 2.4%. The same poll a month ago had Clinton up four points. Polling averages currently have Clinton up 6.2 points (<a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html\">RCP</a>) and 7 points (<a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-general-election-trump-vs-clinton\">HuffPost</a>, which has not yet incorporated the new Quinnipiac poll). </p> <p>Quinnipiac gets an A- in FiveThirtyEight\u2019s <a href=\"http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/\">pollster ratings</a>. For the new poll, conducted on 21-27 June, live interviewers calling land lines and cell phones surveyed 1,610 registered voters nationwide.<br></p> <p>The poll also found that 61% of American voters believe \u201ct<strong>he 2016 election has increased the level of hatred and prejudice </strong>in the United States.\u201d Of that 61%, 67% blame the Trump campaign and 16% blame the Clinton campaign. </p> <p>A separate Reuters/Ipsos poll released late Tuesday found that<strong> </strong>Trump supporters \u201care more likely to describe African Americans as \u2018criminal,\u2019 \u2018unintelligent,\u2019 \u2018lazy\u2019 and \u2018violent\u2019 than voters who backed some Republican rivals in the primaries or who support\u201d Clinton. <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-race-idUSKCN0ZE2SW\">The poll</a>, conducted between March and June, interviewed 16,000 Americans and included 21 questions on attitudes about race, asking them to rate white and black people in terms of a series of perceived personality traits. The pollsters note:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>To be sure, not all Trump supporters expressed negative attitudes about blacks. No more than 50 percent of his supporters rated blacks negatively, relative to whites, on any of the six character traits in the poll.

          "bodyText": "Hillary Clinton has an 81% chance of winning the election to Donald Trump\u2019s 19%, polling analyst Nate Silver said in his first model of the 2016 presidential election. Silver\u2019s calculations are based on a model that processes polling data exclusively. A second model produced by Silver\u2019s FiveThirtyEight web site, taking in economics statistics and historical data, portrayed a slightly tighter race, at 74%-26% for Clinton. Silver gained international fame for his perfect, 50-for-50 performance at predicting state outcomes in advance of the 2012 presidential election. Where many pundits saw a tight race between Republican nominee Mitt Romney and incumbent president Barack Obama, Silver correctly foresaw a 332-206 electoral college blowout. Trump\u2019s ratings abroad are strongly negative, according to a Pew Research report on how people around the world perceive the US. Asked if they had confidence in Trump\u2019s ability to manage foreign policy, only 9% of respondents in 10 EU countries agreed. By contrast, a median of 77% said they had confidence in Barack Obama and 59% in Trump\u2019s likely general election opponent Hillary Clinton. Trump collected the most support in China, with 22% expressing confidence in him. In Canada and India, he had 14% confidence; Australia, 11%; and Japan, 8%. \u201cConfidence in Clinton to handle world affairs is generally high,\u201d the report said. \u201cBy comparison, few trust Trump to do the right thing when it comes to foreign policy.\u201d Not all handshakes go as planned. Take this somewhat awkward three-way shake between the US president and his fellow leaders Justin Trudeau of Canada and Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of Mexico: Trump\u2019s campaign has been asking foreign politicians for donations to help make America great again \u2013 possibly violating federal election rules in the process. Two campaign finance watchdog groups, the Campaign Legal Center and Democracy 21, said they will lodge a complaint with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) alleging that Trump\u2019s campaign has violated federal law by soliciting donations from politicians in Scotland, Australia and Iceland, among others. Earlier today, President Barack Obama spoke out against inequality and the politics of division when he addressed Canada\u2019s legislators in Ottawa. Obama said the result of the recent UK referendum was indicative of the \u201cfrustrations people felt\u201d regarding \u201cinequality, dislocation and the resulting social division,\u201d and that such issues should not be ignored. In a poll revealed during Rachel Maddow\u2019s show on MSNBC, Public Policy Polling found that in a survey of American voters, Hillary Clinton won the support of 43% of voters, Donald Trump won 38% and a giant meteor striking the earth won 13%. The poll will likely be a boon to the bumper-sticker industry. In a conversation with Bill O\u2019Reilly on his eponymous Fox News show, presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump that \u201ca lot\u201d of refugees from Syria are members of the Islamic State. \u201cRemember one other thing,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey are letting tens of thousands of people come in from Syria and nobody knows who these people are and a lot of those people are Isis.\u201d Trump was grilled by O\u2019Reilly on his lack of a concrete strategy for defeating the terrorist group, but protested that the only reason he doesn\u2019t make his plans public is to confuse the group. \u201cWell, I do have them and I hate to give them out because frankly if I win, and it looks like I have a pretty good chance of winning, I don\u2019t like to be giving out all this information,\u201d Trump reasoned in the interview. \u201cI\u2019d like to just go and do the job. If you look at General Patton - he wasn\u2019t one to give out information on television and do what he has to do. I\u2019d hate to give it out. I\u2019ve given out plenty, believe me. I was the one that said \u2018take the oil\u2019 and I hated to tell everybody and we should have taken the oil when we left and we didn\u2019t do it, and who has the oil now? Isis has the oil and Iran is going to have the oil from Iraq.\u201d The city of Cleveland has taken out a staggering $50 million insurance policy to cover possible damages incurred during the Republican National Convention next month, the Plain Dealer reported. The figure represents a quintupling of the city\u2019s prior coverage for the event, an apparent estimation by city officials that Cleveland faces a higher risk of civil unrest this year than other convention host cities. The policy will cost the city $9.5 million, compared to the $1.7 million Tampa paid for its insurance policy during the 2012 Republican National Convention. The policy covers damage to public property, non-Cleveland law enforcement and their equipment, and legal claims made during the convention. North American leaders fought back against isolationism today, promising deeper ties, as Britain\u2019s Brexit vote and Donald Trump\u2019s protectionist stance loomed large. \u201cThe integration of national economies ... That\u2019s here, that\u2019s done,\u201d Barack Obama told reporters after talks with Canadian and Mexican leaders in Ottawa. \u201cAnd us trying to abandon the field and pull up the drawbridge around us is going to be bad for us.\u201d He noted the \u201clegitimate\u201d concerns many have about globalization. \u201cBecause the fact is that as the global economy is integrated, what we\u2019ve seen are trend lines across the advanced economies of growing inequality and stagnant wages.\u201d The isolationism currently being touted on the left and right, he warned, is not the answer. \u201cThat\u2019s the wrong medicine,\u201d he said, one that would lead to disruption and inefficiencies that could result in job losses and a spike in the price of goods. He instead urged countries to take an active approach towards free trade and help shape an international order that prioritizes workers. His embrace of free trade was wholeheartedly echoed by Justin Trudeau, Canada\u2019s prime minister, and Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, the president of Mexico. \u201cWe know that industries that export more goods pay salaries that are 50% higher than sectors that don\u2019t export,\u201d said Trudeau. Obama cautioned those who would see Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union as a rejection of trade, pointing to efforts by those in the Leave campaign to ensure that the UK could continue to have access to the single market. \u201cSo apparently their argument was not against trade generally, they just didn\u2019t want any obligations to go with the access to the free market.\u201d He said he expected the global economy to hold steady in the short term, but flagged long term concerns if Brexit goes through and investment in the UK or Europe stagnates. Two-time Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney told an audience at the Aspen Ideas Festival this afternoon that members of his family are still pushing for him to enter the race a third time as a third-party candidate, if only to thwart the accession of presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump to the presidency. \u201cMy wife and kids wanted me to run again this time,\u201d Romney said. \u201cI got an email from one of my sons yesterday, saying \u2018You gotta get in, Dad. You gotta get in.\u2019\u201d But the former Massachusetts governor and Republican nominee added that he doesn\u2019t think that a third-party candidate could do anything than serve as a spoiler. \u201cI don\u2019t think an independent candidate can win,\u201d Romney continued. \u201cIt\u2019s hard on family. It\u2019s hard on your spouse, sitting there in debates, just agonizing over what you\u2019re gonna say next. Or what your kids have to go through. Or what your grandkids go through.\u201d Congress delivered relief to debt-stricken Puerto Rico on Wednesday, sending President Barack Obama a last-minute financial rescue package to help the US territory of 3.5 million. The Senate passed the bill on a bipartisan 68-30 vote, three weeks after the House overwhelmingly backed the measure. The vote came two days before the island is supposed to make a $2bn payment to creditors. Obama is expected to move quickly and sign the legislation. Puerto Rico is in a decade-long recession and has $70bn in debt. Thousands have fled the territory for the US mainland. Businesses on the island have closed, schools have struggled with limited electricity, and hospitals have asked for cash payment in advance for some medication. The White House and Republican and Democratic leaders in Congress have warned that without help from Washington, the island could descend into economic chaos, with signs already pointing to a humanitarian crisis. In a rare feat of election-year unity, all four Republican and Democratic leaders in Congress supported the bill. The legislation would create a control board to oversee the US territory\u2019s finances and supervise some debt restructuring. It would not provide any direct financial aid to the territory, but leaders warned that a bailout could eventually become necessary if Congress doesn\u2019t take this step. \u201cIf we don\u2019t act before the island misses a critical debt payment deadline this Friday, matters will only get worse for Puerto Rico and for taxpayers,\u201d warned Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell. Donald Trump\u2019s campaign has been asking foreign politicians for donations to help make America great again \u2013 possibly violating federal election rules in the process. On Wednesday, two campaign finance watchdog groups, the Campaign Legal Center and Democracy 21, said they will lodge a complaint with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) alleging that Trump\u2019s campaign has violated federal law by soliciting donations from politicians in Scotland, Australia and Iceland, among others. \u201cDonald Trump should have known better,\u201d said Paul S Ryan, deputy executive director of Campaign Legal Center. \u201cIt is a no-brainer that it violates the law to send fundraising emails to members of a foreign government on their official foreign government email accounts, and yet, that\u2019s exactly what Trump has done repeatedly.\u201d The Federal Election Campaign Act prohibits \u201cany foreign national from contributing, donating, or spending funds in connection with any federal, state, or local election in the United States, either directly or indirectly. It is also unlawful to help foreign nationals violate that ban or to solicit, receive or accept contributions or donations from them.\u201d The complaint argues that the Trump campaign has \u201cknowingly and illegally\u201d solicited donations from the foreign nationals. It includes several references to media reports of politicians receiving fundraising emails, including a number of members of parliament in Iceland and Australia as well as the 54 members of the Scottish National party and UK House of Commons. An advance transcript of Donald Trump\u2019s interview with Fox News anchor Bill O\u2019Reilly, set to air tonight, show O\u2019Reilly grilling the presumptive Republican presidential nominee on his lack of specificity in his plan to defeat the Islamic State. \u201cWell, I do have them and I hate to give them out because frankly if I win, and it looks like I have a pretty good chance of winning, I don\u2019t like to be giving out all this information,\u201d Trump reasoned in the interview, set to air at 9pm EDT tonight. \u201cI\u2019d like to just go and do the job. If you look at General Patton - he wasn\u2019t one to give out information on television and do what he has to do. I\u2019d hate to give it out. I\u2019ve given out plenty, believe me. I was the one that said \u2018take the oil\u2019 and I hated to tell everybody and we should have taken the oil when we left and we didn\u2019t do it, and who has the oil now? Isis has the oil and Iran is going to have the oil from Iraq.\u201d O\u2019Reilly pressed Trump on his claims that he has \u201ca pretty good chance\u201d of winning the general election, pointing out that recent polling shows him lagging far behind presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, who has outspent him on advertising in the month of June $26 million to zero. Confronted with a recent Fox News poll that shows only 34% of Americans see him as honest and trustworthy, Trump protested. \u201cI\u2019m honest, I\u2019m trustworthy. I tell it like it is. I\u2019m here, I didn\u2019t need to do this. I\u2019m enjoying it, but I\u2019m enjoying it because we are going to make America great again. We are going to make America great again. We\u2019re also going to make America safe again.\u201d Trump pointed to another poll that shows him outperforming among Latino voters compared to his Republican predecessor at the top of the ticket. \u201cI just saw a poll that came out, I think it was Quinnipiac, where I\u2019m at 33% with Hispanics now,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI\u2019m six, seven or eight points higher than Romney was. If I listened to you a few months ago, I was going to get nothing with Hispanics.\u201d President Barack Obama\u2019s address to the Canadian parliament was apparently well-received: City officials in Cleveland have approved a new set of rules ahead of next month\u2019s Republican National Convention that extend the protest route for demonstrators who wish to march outside venues during the convention, the result of a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio over First Amendment concerns. The new rules, according to The Plain Dealer, reduce the size of the so-called \u201cevent zone,\u201d in which heightened security would dampen protests, by half. They will also extend and reroute the designated \u201cprotest route\u201d path closer to convention venues, and to end in a more populous area of downtown Cleveland. \u201cThis agreement prevents the 2016 RNC from being defined by an unnecessary conflict between freedom and security,\u201d Chris Link, the ACLU of Ohio\u2019s executive director, said in a written statement. \u201cThe RNC offers a unique stage to groups from all sides of the political spectrum to lift their voices to a national audience. The new rules ensure that people have meaningful opportunities to express themselves on some of our most important national issues.\u201d The settlement, first agreed upon last week, is the result of a June 14 lawsuit filed by the ACLU of Ohio on behalf of both pro- and anti-RNC groups that wished to demonstrate during the convention. The original rules, under which the protest route was a quarter-mile shorter and the \u201cevent zone\u201d was twice the size, were thrown out last Thursday by a US district judge as violations of the First Amendment right to peaceful assembly and public expression. The British national who was arrested at a Las Vegas rally for presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump two weeks ago has been indicted by a federal grand jury. Michael Sandford, 20, allegedly attempted to seize a Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department officer\u2019s firearm at the June 18 rally. According to US Attorney Daniel Bogden, Sandford has been charged with two counts of possessing a firearm as an illegal alien and one found of disrupting the orderly conduct of government business and official functions. All three counts are felonies; if convicted on all counts, Sandford faces up to 30 years in prison and $750,000 in fines. According to the Justice Department, Sandford, originally of Dorking, Surrey, allegedly took shooting lessons at a Las Vegas gun range the day before the rally using a Glock 9 millimeter handgun, the same make and model used by Las Vegas law enforcement. The next day, Sandford allegedly approached a uniformed police officer and attempted to seize the officer\u2019s sidearm. Sandford told police following his arrest that his intention had been \u201cto shoot and kill Trump,\u201d according to court papers. He told law enforcement that he had been planning the assassination for \u201cabout a year,\u201d and believed that he himself would be killed in the attempt. Family members have told the press that Sandford has an autism-spectrum disorder and have floated the possibility that he was coerced into attempting to shoot Trump. \u201cI doubt he would even know who the president of the United States is,\u201d Sandford\u2019s father, Paul Davey, told the Portsmouth News. The case is being investigated by the US Secret Service. Elizabeth Warren, tipped as a possible running mate for Hillary Clinton, did not let Google\u2019s famously close relationship with Democrats stop her having a dig at the tech giant during a speech at Capitol Hill in Washington. \u201cGoogle, Apple and Amazon provide platforms that lots of companies depend on for survival,\u201d she said at an event organised by the New America think tank. \u201cBut Google, Apple and Amazon also in many cases compete with those small companies so that platform can become a tool to snuff out competition.\u201d In 2012, she noted, Federal Trade Commission (FTC) staff concluded that Google was using its dominant search engine to harms rivals of its Google+ user review feature. FTC commissioners ultimately ruled against their staff, but the European Commission has moved forward with formal charges on similar allegations, \u201cand Europeans may soon enjoy better protections than US customers\u201d. Warren, a Democratic senator for Massachusetts, cited similar charges against Apple and Amazon during a barnstorming speech about the danger posed by monopolies to competition, middle class economic security and, ultimately, democracy itself. \u201cThey deserve to be highly profitable and to be highly successful but the opportunity to compete must remain open for new entrants and smaller competitors who want their chance to change the world,\u201d she said. Warren also took a swipe at major US airlines, which she said had raked in $22bn in profits even as customer complaints rose, and retailer Walmart, which offered meagre wages. While praising the Obama administration for stepping up antitrust law enforcement since the Reagan years, Warren said 2015 was \u201cthe biggest year for mergers in US history, both in terms of the number of mergers and the size of mergers\u201d. Warren, who shared a platform with Clinton earlier this week, warned the audience on Capitol Hill: \u201cToday in America, competition is dying.\u201d Not all handshakes go as planned. Donald Trump\u2019s campaign has helpfully summarized his remarks in Bangor, Maine, which just concluded a few minutes ago: \u00b7 As Mr. Trump continues to argue for change in our rigged system, many who have benefited from these imbalanced trade deals are lashing out to maintain the status quo. \u00b7 Mr. Trump takes their attacks as a compliment, and proof that his challenge to the system is shaking D.C. Mr. Trump wants trade deals, but he wants trade deals that are fair, balanced and benefit American workers. Ones that will produce jobs and wealth for our country and our workers. \u00b7 America has lost nearly a third of our manufacturing jobs in the last 20 years. This comes as our population has increased by over 50 million in the same time. Since 2000, American household income is down $4,000, and the percentage of those outside the labor force has reached its highest level since the 1970\u2019s. \u00b7 Imbalanced trade deals have negatively impacted the American economy. We are no longer the world\u2019s dominant producer and our economy has weakened as a result. \u00b7 Clinton has been on the other side of this fight, as an extreme globalist who fights only for the D.C. special interests. America will suffer under her presidency. \u00b7 Mr. Trump will continue to fight to put America First, and will make sure that any trade deals are in the best interests of the country, and not established D.C. special interests. Perhaps a first in Republican presidential politics, Donald Trump launched into a tirade against the US Chamber of Commerce at a rally in Bangor, Maine, a group that historically backs Republican presidential candidates. \u201cThe US Chamber of Commerce is totally controlled by the special interest groups, folks, just so you understand it,\u201d Trump told the audience. \u201cAnd they\u2019re a special interest that want to have the deal that they want to have. They want to have TPP, Trans-Pacific Partnership - one of the worst deals, it\u2019ll be the worst deal since Nafta. No, it\u2019ll be the worst deal - it\u2019ll drain the rest of your businesses out of Maine. Believe me. It\u2019ll be the worse deal since Nafta.\u201d The lobbying organization heavily criticized an economic address Trump gave earlier this week, calling his proposals to leave TPP and Nafta a recipe for national recession. \u201cThe US recession would set in within the first year under Trump\u2019s proposed trade policies, which include a 35% tariff on imports from Mexico and a 45% tax on goods coming in from China,\u201d wrote the US Chamber of Commerce\u2019s JD Harrison. \u201cOver the next three years, the US economy would shrink by 4.6% and the unemployment rate would nearly double to 9.5%.\u201d Donald Trump mocks the argument that his failure to spend any money - literally a single dollar - on campaign advertising, citing polling information as evidence that he doesn\u2019t need to spend the money. \u201cI haven\u2019t spent, I don\u2019t think, one dollar on a commercial. So the Quinnipiac poll just came out and we\u2019re essentially tied. Crooked Hillary has spent on commercials... I\u2019ve heard $68 million on negative commercials,\u201d Trump says, apparently pulling a number out of the clear blue sky. \u201cShe\u2019s got 900 people, I\u2019ve got 73,\u201d Trump continues. \u201cShe spent $100 million - or something, a lot... in some form on negative stuff, I spent nothing.\u201d \u201cAnd we\u2019re essentially tied! That\u2019s not good.\u201d Donald Trump on Bernie Sanders: I know what he thinks inside. He hates her. I mean, he hates her. Bernie Sanders cannot stand Hillary Clinton. \u201cIf things don\u2019t work out for me, I may just come up here and say \u2018what the hell,\u2019\u201d Donald Trump says, of moving to Maine. \u201cAnd more importantly, you have great people up here.\u201d Trump them launches into a criticism of likely Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton, who Trump blames for the rise of the Islamic State. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna this, and we\u2019re gonna that. We\u2019re gonna this,\u201d Trump says. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t done anything about what\u2019s going on. Isis was formed during her tenure, Isis is now worse than ever, you see what happened yesterday,\u201d Trump continues, referring to currently unclaimed suicide bombings in Istanbul that left scores dead. After a confusing cacophony of multiple songs - both \u201cGet Ready For This\u201d and what sounded like the music played at a laser-tag arena - Donald Trump mounts the dais in Bangor, Maine, and praises the state\u2019s governor, Paul LePage, who introduced him. \u201cI call him \u2018our\u2019 governor,\u201d Trump says fondly. \u201cI only wish the media would show this crowd,\u201d Trump says, repeating a frequent and unfounded critique. \u201cThey never show the crowd - they only show the crowd when there\u2019s a little bit of a protestor. Do we have any protestors? No? That\u2019s too bad.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s something going on, folks! There\u2019s something really good going on - we\u2019re going to make America great again!\u201d Trumps says, mentioning recent Quinnipiac University polling that shows him closing the gap with presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Watch it here: Maine is a stretch for Trump in a general election: Mitt Romney performed better in Minnesota than he did in Maine\u2019s 2nd congressional district. Howie Carr, a talk-radio king in Boston, is warming up the crowd in Bangor, Maine, ahead of Donald Trump\u2019s rally with an Elizabeth Warren \u201cimpression\u201d: Ohio governor and former Republican presidential candidate John Kasich\u2019s onetime chief strategist shared a poll this afternoon that showed Kasich performing better in battleground states against Hillary Clinton than his party\u2019s presumptive presidential nominee. \u201cClinton defeated him in all 7 states by an average of 11 points,\u201d John Weaver wrote, citing a Ballotpedia battlegrounds survey released today, which showed Clinton leading Donald Trump in the seven swing-iest states in the country. \u201cThe buried news-lede though was the ballot tests,\u201d Weaver continued. \u201cThey confirm what we said throughout the campaign: John Kasich was the very best candidate to defeat Hillary Clinton. On average Governor Kasich defeated Clinton by 4 points in the 7 key swing states, Speaker Ryan tied her.\u201d \u201cThe data is [sic] just further proof that Governor Kasich is the most popular Republican politician in the nation today and it underlies why his efforts to help our US Senate and House candidates are so very important,\u201d Weaver concluded. Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight, America\u2019s premier source (argue your point!) for elections and polling analysis, has unveiled the site\u2019s forecast in the 2016 presidential election. A FiveThirtyEight polls-only model rates Clinton\u2019s chance of winning the presidency at 80.6% and Trump\u2019s at 19.3%. A second model that incorporates economic statistics and historical data portrays a slightly tighter race, 73.6%-26.4%. A \u201cnow-cast\u201d \u2013 who would win the election today? \u2013 has the race at 86%-14% for Clinton. Why credit what Nate Silver thinks? Because in 2008 he predicted 49 of 50 states correctly (missing Obama\u2019s squeaker Indiana win) and all the Senate races correctly, and in 2012 he predicted 50 of 50 states correctly. Silver\u2019s 2012 call was especially sweet because he predicted a blowout 332-206 electoral college victory for Obama when a lot of other loud people said the president was in a close reelection fight with Mitt Romney. They were wrong, Silver was right. Why discount what Nate Silver thinks? Because in August he gave Trump a 2% chance of winning the Republican nomination, in March FiveThirtyEight\u2019s model gave Clinton a 99% chance of winning the Michigan primary (Bernie Sanders won by a half-point) and in the 2014 midterms he failed to anticipate a Republican wave that created multiple upsets of FiveThirtyEight\u2019s modeling (\u201cthe polls did have a strong bias this year,\u201d Silver wrote afterward). Caveat lector. Here\u2019s what Nate Silver thinks this year: The model rates the election in each state. For a sense of Clinton\u2019s advantage at this point, consider the 12 tightest state races in FiveThirtyEight\u2019s model. Trump could win them all \u2013 and Clinton would still win the presidency, so long as she won the 13th tossup state, Florida. The model has Pennsylvania at +7 for the Democrat with Clinton having an 85.9% chance of winning. The model has Arizona, which should be a Republican shoe-in, basically tied with a slight edge for Clinton. The model has North Carolina, Iowa, Colorado, Ohio, New Hampshire and Florida all leaning toward Clinton. The model really stinks for Trump. There\u2019s an entertaining section that awards probabilities for \u201ccrazy and not-so-crazy scenarios\u201d. For example the model thinks that Trump has a 90.6% chance of winning at least one state Obama won in 2012; keep your eye on Colorado, Iowa and New Hampshire. The model puts the probability of a \u201cClinton landslide\u201d at 29.2%. Here\u2019s how the basic FiveThirtyEight map looks (but click through for their real map, which captures varying strengths, state-to-state, of redness and blueness): It\u2019s the kind of map that would deliver on David Plouffe\u2019s prediction of 350+ electoral votes for Clinton. (Not rare: Obama beat John McCain in 2008 365-173; in 1996 Bill Clinton beat Bob Dole 379-159; in 1992 Clinton beat George HW Bush 370-168.) Discuss? Following appearances yesterday in Ohio and Pennsylvania and a rally planned this afternoon for Maine, Trump on Thursday will visit New Hampshire, local WMUR reports: The North American Leaders\u2019 summit appears to be progressing nicely: Donald Trump is apparently using a Ben Carson donor list to solicit funds: Whatever lists Trump is using, one of them includes the former prime minister of Canada: Trump is also soliciting donations on Facebook: The city of Cleveland is making way for demonstrators wishing to manifest their displeasure with Republicans who plan to gather to nominate Donald Trump for president next month. The city approved rules increasing the area protesters can occupy and the amount of time they can spend there, the New York Times reports: People will have more opportunities to be seen by delegates especially with the new parade route,\u201d said ACLU spokesman Stephen David. \u201cThese regulations are a significant improvement from what we had seen before.\u201d The spectacle inside the convention is also in flux. The Washington Post reports that the convention \u201cis poised to be the most chaotic GOP gathering of the modern era\u201d: Dozens of well-known Republicans aren\u2019t showing up. There\u2019s no word yet on who will speak. A growing number of corporate sponsors are taking a pass. Groups of white supremacists and other agitators are on the way, while the official protest routes are frantically being redrawn after being thrown out in court. And then there\u2019s the fight to dethrone the big star. It\u2019s not as if the Trump campaign is not laying plans for an unforgettable convention. Ivanka Trump told a Virginia-based radio host Wednesday that the campaign has recruited stars to make cameo appearances: \u201cIt\u2019s not gonna be a ho-hum lineup of the typical politicians,\u201d she said, in remarks reported by BuzzFeed. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be a great combination of our great politicians, but also great American businessmen and women and leaders across industry and leaders across really all the sectors, from athletes to coaches and everything in between.\u201d Bloomberg reported Tuesday that the Trump campaign had recruited Mike Ditka, the Chicago Bears coach; Bobby Knight, the Indiana basketball coach; Brian France, the Nascar chief; and Mike Tyson, the boxer. Trump himself said the Tyson part was wrong: The Trump campaign is soliciting campaign donations from foreign elected officials, including members of parliament in Britain, Australia, Iceland, Denmark, Finland and maybe Canada, TPM reports. Is it legal for non-Americans to contribute to US political campaigns? Let\u2019s have a quick look at the FEC FAQ. Nope, not legal: Foreign nationals are prohibited from making any contributions or expenditures in connection with any election in the U.S. TPM\u2019s Josh Marshall speculates that the Trumps rented or bought multiple bad potential campaign donor lists and are relentlessly spamming away. \u201cBut obviously, as big as a buffoon as Trump is, and as crooked as he is, there\u2019s no possible way his campaign is intentionally soliciting small donor contributions from members of foreign parliaments,\u201d Marshall writes: Somehow this must be incompetence in how they bought their email solicitation lists. But how? Candidly I didn\u2019t know you could easily buy the email list of all members of the Icelandic parliament. But it seems like you can. [...] The only plausible answer seems to be that the Trump campaign either dealt with a sloppy or disreputable list broker or was so desperate after its horrible May FEC report was released that it went to a broker and just said they wanted every list and they\u2019d sort it all out later. I confess that both scenarios seem a little farfetched. But some version of one of them basically had to happen, unless there\u2019s a prankster actually inside the campaign. Read the full piece here. The New York Times\u2019 Jonathan Martin tells the shady story of real estate seminars branded \u201cTrump Institute\u201d: Yet there was an even more fundamental deceit to the business, unreported until now: Extensive portions of the materials that students received after forking over their seminar fees, supposedly containing Mr. Trump\u2019s special wisdom, had been plagiarized from an obscure real estate manual published a decade earlier. Together, the exaggerated claims about his own role, the checkered pasts of the people with whom he went into business and the theft of intellectual property at the venture\u2019s heart all illustrate the fiction underpinning so many of Mr. Trump\u2019s licensing businesses: Putting his name on products and services \u2014 and collecting fees \u2014 was often where his actual involvement began and ended. Read the full piece here. Here\u2019s video from Trump\u2019s Ohio rally last night in which he was cheered for calling for the return of waterboarding: Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign manager predicts a blowout Clinton victory: That\u2019s 350 out of 538, of course. Such a map might look like this: Donald Trump\u2019s ratings abroad are strongly negative, according to a Pew Research report on how people around the world perceive the US, writes the Guardian\u2019s Amanda Holpuch: Asked if they had confidence in Trump\u2019s ability to manage foreign policy, only 9% of respondents in 10 EU countries agreed. By contrast, a median of 77% said they had confidence in Barack Obama and 59% in Trump\u2019s likely general election opponent Hillary Clinton. Trump collected the most support in China, with 22% expressing confidence in him. In Canada and India, he had 14% confidence; Australia, 11%; and Japan, 8%. \u201cConfidence in Clinton to handle world affairs is generally high,\u201d the report said. \u201cBy comparison, few trust Trump to do the right thing when it comes to foreign policy.\u201d People who have confidence in Russian president Vladimir Putin are more likely to have confidence in Trump, the report says. For instance 44% of those in Italy who have confidence in Putin also have confidence in Trump, whereas only 12% of those who have no confidence in Putin have confidence in Trump. Read the full piece here: Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski had HarperCollins on the line for a $1.2m deal to write a book tentatively titled Let Trump Be Trump, but the deal fell apart when Lewandowski refused to share with the publisher the non-disclosure agreement he signed with Trump, Politico reports. Lewandowski reportedly makes $500,000 as a political analyst on CNN, paid to say things like \u201cWell I think this is Mr. Trump\u2019s best speech of the presidential cycle, candidly\u201d. Lewandowski has denied that CNN pays him half a million. And now he denies the book deal report: The problem with Lewandowski\u2019s denials is that he has a record of saying things that are not true, as when he told reporter Michelle Fields this... ...or when he told BuzzFeed that he had no book deal: Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell tells NY1 that Trump is \u201cgetting closer\u201d to being a credible candidate. \u201cTrump clearly needs to change, in my opinion, to win the general election,\u201d McConnell said: What I\u2019ve said to him both publicly and privately: \u2018You\u2019re a great entertainer. You turn on audiences. You\u2019re good before a crowd. You have a lot of Twitter followers. That worked fine for you in the primaries. But now that you are in the general, people are looking for a level of seriousness that is typically conveyed by having a prepared text and Teleprompter and staying on message.\u2019 So my hope is that he is beginning to pivot and become what I would call a more serious and credible candidate for the highest office in the land. Asked whether Trump has crossed a \u201cthreshold of credibility\u201d, McConnell replied, \u201cHe\u2019s getting closer. Getting closer.\u201d At least she waved? Ballotpedia has conducted polling in seven battleground states \u2013 and Clinton leads Trump in all of them: 51% to 37% in Florida 45% to 41% in Iowa 50% to 33% in Michigan 48% to 38% in North Carolina 46% to 37% in Ohio 49% to 35% in Pennsylvania 45% to 38% in Virginia Those gaps \u2013 a lot of them in the teens \u2013 are larger than the national polling averages showing Clinton up by six or seven. How is that possible? Let\u2019s check in on the polling analysts at FiveThirtyEight: Harry Enten does not see anything obviously amiss with Ballotopedia\u2019s work: When the numbers were different, folks usually look for a reason to dismiss the numbers. I see nothing wrong in the methodology per se (2/?) Some might say the long field dates, but Q-Pac had similar time in the field in swing states last week. But the #s looked \u201cnormal\u201d (3/?) That\u2019s not to say the polls are \u201cright\u201d. I\u2019m just saying you shouldn\u2019t exclude them from an average. We won\u2019t. We\u2019ll weight them tho. The ABC poll in question (20-23 June) had Clinton up by 12 points on Trump. How does state polling square with national polling? It doesn\u2019t sometimes, writes David Byler for RealClearPolitics. Here\u2019s some of his analysis: There are many valid ways to think about these discrepancies, but we\u2019ll limit ourselves to three reasonable, straightforward approaches. First, one could focus on the national polls and mostly ignore the state polling for the time being. Right now there aren\u2019t that many swing state polls, and there are a number of swing states (e.g. Wisconsin and Nevada) where there aren\u2019t even enough polls to calculate an RCP average. And many voters are still undecided. So it might be prudent to give state polls time to fall in line with national polls and not sweat the discrepancy too much yet. Trump touts the first poll since 17 June to show him within striking distance of Clinton: Polling averages currently have Clinton up by between six and seven points. An ABC News / Washington Post poll in mid-May had Trump up by two points, and Rasmussen and Fox News polls at the time also had him with a slight lead. Donald Trump is making a play for an extra electoral vote in Maine, which has a unique system for awarding its four electoral votes: two go to the winner of the popular vote, and one each go to the winners in the state\u2019s two congressional districts. Trump apparently sees a pickup opportunity in the state\u2019s second congressional district, where a local poll last week had him ahead by one point. Neither of Maine\u2019s districts has gone for a Republican candidate for president since 1988. Barack Obama has arrived in Ottawa to participate in the North American Leaders\u2019 Summit. He will be welcomed by prime minister Justin Trudeau before participating in a bilateral meeting with president Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of Mexico, according to the White House. The president will participate in a North American Leaders\u2019 Summit working session and a leader photo before having a working lunch with Trudeau and Nieto. There will be a trilateral press conference, an arrival ceremony at Parliament Hill and a bilateral meeting with Trudeau. Later, Obama will address Parliament. In the evening, Obama will meet with Embassy personnel and families. Then he will fly home. The president will join the presumptive Democratic nominee on the campaign trail the day after Independence Day, according to the Clinton campaign. The pair is scheduled to take the stage on 5 July in Charlotte, North Carolina. An MSNBC producer flags a wry (rueful?) McCain quip: We posted earlier about Misty Snow\u2019s victory in the Utah senate primary \u2013 but she was but one of two transgender women to win congressional primaries Tuesday. In Colorado, transgender woman Misty Plowright scored a Democratic primary victory in the state\u2019s 5th congressional district. She will take on incumbent Republican Doug Lamborn in November. A Democrat has never held the seat, according to the Colorado Springs Gazette. Plowright\u2019s campaign biography identifies her as \u201can Army veteran, a self-educated woman, a member of the LGBTQ+ community, and a passionate social democrat.\u201d She and her wife have a third partner, the biography says: She has been in a committed long-term relationship with her wife Lisa for 9 years. [...] They have both been in a loving, long-term, committed relationship with their mutual partner, Sebastian, for the last 2 years. All 3 partners support each other emotionally, physically and financially. An Economist/YouGov poll released Wednesday morning has Hillary Clinton leading Donald Trump among registered voters nationwide by five points, 40-35. The poll was conducted on 24-27 June, surveyed 1,300 respondents and had a margin of error of +/- 3.9%. The poll is more closely in line with polling averages, which show Clinton up by six or seven points, than was the aforementioned Quinnipiac poll released Wednesday morning, which depicted a neck-and-neck race. Misty K Snow, a transgender woman, won Utah\u2019s Democratic senate primary Tuesday, making her the first transgender person to be nominated by a major party for the US senate. \u201cA lot of people have told me whether I win or lose, I\u2019m already making a difference just by running,\u201d Snow was quoted by the Salt Lake Tribune as saying. Snow will face incumbent Republican senator Mike Lee in November, in an uphill battle as a Democrat in one of the country\u2019s most reliably conservative states. Lee was the first senator to endorse Ted Cruz for president and has resisted shifting his endorsement to Donald Trump. The Tribune describes the platform of Snow, who got into the race just before the filing deadline: Snow credited her primary election performance to her focus on \u201cissues that Democrats care about.\u201d She has called for a $15 per hour minimum wage, paid family leave, legalized marijuana, criminal-justice reform and free or reduced tuition for higher education, a platform inspired by presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. She said her goal is to boost working-class people such as herself. She\u2019s employed as a cashier at a Harmons grocery and hasn\u2019t gone to college, partly due to the cost and partly because she wasn\u2019t sure what career path she would like to take. Now she\u2019s seeking to become a federal lawmaker. Hello and welcome to our live-wire coverage of the 2016 race for the White House. A new Quinnipiac poll has the presidential race neck-and-neck, with Hillary Clinton at 42% and Donald Trump at 40%, and a margin of error of +/- 2.4%. The same poll a month ago had Clinton up four points. Polling averages currently have Clinton up 6.2 points (RCP) and 7 points (HuffPost, which has not yet incorporated the new Quinnipiac poll). Quinnipiac gets an A- in FiveThirtyEight\u2019s pollster ratings. For the new poll, conducted on 21-27 June, live interviewers calling land lines and cell phones surveyed 1,610 registered voters nationwide. The poll also found that 61% of American voters believe \u201cthe 2016 election has increased the level of hatred and prejudice in the United States.\u201d Of that 61%, 67% blame the Trump campaign and 16% blame the Clinton campaign. A separate Reuters/Ipsos poll released late Tuesday found that Trump supporters \u201care more likely to describe African Americans as \u2018criminal,\u2019 \u2018unintelligent,\u2019 \u2018lazy\u2019 and \u2018violent\u2019 than voters who backed some Republican rivals in the primaries or who support\u201d Clinton. The poll, conducted between March and June, interviewed 16,000 Americans and included 21 questions on attitudes about race, asking them to rate white and black people in terms of a series of perceived personality traits. The pollsters note: To be sure, not all Trump supporters expressed negative attitudes about blacks. No more than 50 percent of his supporters rated blacks negatively, relative to whites, on any of the six character traits in the poll. Yet when their answers to the poll questions were compared with responses from supporters of other candidates, Trump supporters were always more critical of blacks on personality traits, analysis of the results showed. Trump encouraged the United States to make torture legal Tuesday in remarks responding to the Istanbul airport attack. \u201cWhat do you think about waterboarding?\u201d Trump asked a crowd in Ohio, which cheered as he gave his answer, \u201cI like it a lot. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s tough enough.\u201d Trump also three times compared the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement to \u201cthe rape of our country\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s a harsh word but it\u2019s true,\u201d he said. Clinton outspends Trump $26m - $0 According to data compiled by SMG Delta for NBC News, Clinton and her supporters spent $26 million on ads in eight battleground states in the month of June. Trump\u2019s total expenditure: $0. Trump has a rally planned this afternoon in Bangor, Maine, while Clinton has a fundraiser in San Francisco.

I kept going anyway, I wasn\u2019t really thinking, and as I turned the corner into the main tunnel I saw a wave of people racing towards me in complete terror, babies screaming, an old man in a wheelchair stranded in the middle of the crowd. He had lost his friends.</p> <p>People were shouting \u201cbomb! bomb!\u201d, \u201crun! run!\u201d, but there isn\u2019t anywhere to run except back to the gates that you came from, so people were funnelled back towards the planes.</p> <p>I kept on going towards the visa desks, but they were all deserted except for police patrolling with guns who ordered me back.</p> </blockquote> <p>Cameron said that after about 20 minutes wait, officials opened up the visa desks and allowed people to exit - checking their passports despite a scene of disarray. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On the other side, in the baggage area, you could see where the bomb had gone off. There was dust everywhere, ceiling panels on the floor, shattered glass, blood and big piles of dusty luggage that had obviously been abandoned by people trying to escape.</p> <p>You do think \u2018shit, if our plane had landed half an hour earlier, that could have been my bag sitting there\u2019. I saw a chap with a bloodied arm, and someone with a rag on his head, but nothing catastrophic, the worst injured people had probably been taken to hospital already.</p> <p>As we came out, we saw the impact of an even bigger bomb on our left, by the start of the taxi rank. There was blood smeared on the floor, sirens, at least seven ambulances.

He said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Many of our friends drove injured people to the surrounding hospitals for free.

The blast at Pudong International Airport, China\u2019s second-busiest, was carried out using fireworks stuffed inside empty beer bottles.<br></p> <p><strong>March 22, 2016</strong> - 16 people are killed in two suicide bombings as bombs ripped through check-in counters at Brussels Airport. The Islamic State group claims responsibility for the attack. A subsequent explosion at a Brussels subway station killed 16 more people.</p> <p><strong>March 7 2016</strong> - A bomb explodes in a piece of luggage at an airport in a central Somali town, wounding three people. Somalia\u2019s Islamic extremist rebels, al-Shabab, claim responsibility for the blast.</p> <p><strong>December 28, 2015</strong> - A suicide car bomb attack killed at least one civilian near the eastern entrance of the Kabul international airport.

          "bodyText": "Guardian reporters Constanze Letsch and Emma Graham-Harrison have published a definitive second-day story covering the attacks on Ataturk airport now, so point your browsers there to get the full low-down. In the meantime, here is a summary of the main events: 41 people were killed and 239 wounded in a gun and bombing attack on the Ataturk international airport in Istanbul on Tuesday night. 13 of the 41 dead are foreign nationals, including five from Saudi Arabia, two from Iraq, and one each from Tunisia, Uzbekistan, China, Iran, Ukraine and Jordan. The Palestinian ambassador to Turkey has also said a Palestinian woman was killed. Authorities believe three men armed with Kalashnikov rifles attacked the airport, detonating suicide vests when confronted by police officers. No group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack, but Turkey\u2019s prime minister, Binali Yildirim, has said the attack was carried out by Daesh (Islamic State). Yildirim said the men caught a taxi to the airport, launching their assault at the international arrivals terminal. Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan said the attack showed \u201cthe dark face of terror that targets innocent civilians\u201d The bombing at Atat\u00fcrk \u2013 Turkey\u2019s largest airport, and the third-busiest in Europe \u2013 is the third suicide attack on Istanbul in 2016. Atat\u00fcrk airport has reopened, with incoming and outgoing flights \u2013 which were halted in the immediate aftermath of the attack \u2013 operating this morning, although many are cancelled or delayed. Foreign ministers from around the world, including Russia and Israel - two countries previously at odds with Turkey - have offered their condolences and support. Israel\u2019s president has followed up his country\u2019s recent rapprochement with Turkey by sending his condolences after the attack on Ataturk airport. Reuven Rivlin told Recep Tayyip Erdogan that their countries\u2019 reconciliation pact will help with joint efforts to fight terrorism, and that Israel is willing to help Turkey recover from the attack. The two countries, once close allies, have suffered six years of animosity after Israeli commandoes killed Turkish nationals sailing aboard an aid convoy bound for the Gaza Strip. Rivlin\u2019s letter says: I take this opportunity to welcome the chance to renew our good relationship especially because our strengthened dialogue will greatly aid in our joint efforts against this threat, and because it sends a strong message to the terrorists that we will stand untied against hatred. Colleagues on the graphics desk have put together a new map of the events at Ataturk airport last night. It takes account of eyewitnesses reports that claim - in contradiction of the official account - that a gunman made it past security cordons and into the check-in area on the airport\u2019s first floor departure lounge. A Palestinian woman was among those killed in the blasts at Istanbul\u2019s Ataturk airport, Palestine\u2019s ambassador to Turkey has said. Six more Palestinians were injured, including a 17-year-old girl from Gaza who is critically hurt. Ambassador Faed Mustafa confirmed the death and injuries to Palestinian media Wednesday, the Associated Press reported. Nisreen Melhem, 28, from the West Bank town of Arraba, was killed and her 34-year-old husband and 3-year-old daughter were injured, according to Moath Hamed, a Palestinian journalism student visiting the family in the hospital. The Palestinians were living and working in Saudi Arabia and had landed in Istanbul for vacation. Pope Francis has denounced the \u201cbrutal terrorist attack\u201d at Istanbul\u2019s airport and is calling for the killers behind it to change their ways. In a noontime blessing from his studio window, Francis said he was praying for the victims, their families \u201cand the dear Turkish people.\u201d He asked the entire piazza to pray in silence and then led the crowd in the Hail Mary prayer. He said: \u201cMay the Lord convert the hearts of the violent ones and support our efforts toward the path of peace.\u201d A full breakdown of the nationalities of those killed in the attacks has been released to Kareem Shaheen, the Guardian\u2019s Middle East reporter, by a Turkish official. According to the latest figures, there are 41 dead and 239 wounded, with 109 discharged from hospital. Among those killed are: Five from Saudi Arabia Two from Iraq One from Tunisia One from Uzbekistan One from China One from Iran One from Ukraine One from Jordan This means that 13 out of the 41 dead are foreign nationals. The rest are Turkish citizens. The number of dead from last night\u2019s coordinated terrorist attacks on Istanbul\u2019s main airport has now risen to 41, according to the Associated Press. The agency cites an announcement from the governor of Istanbul that gives the new death toll. It is not clear what the reasons are for the increased death toll. Laurence Cameron, a journalist with British TV company intrepid, was travelling through Istanbul airport to the Turkish city of Izmir when the bombs went off. He told Guardian reporter Emma Graham-Harrison what happened after he departed from the flight and walked into the airport: As I walked up the bridge to the airport, I heard the sound of panic. I kept going anyway, I wasn\u2019t really thinking, and as I turned the corner into the main tunnel I saw a wave of people racing towards me in complete terror, babies screaming, an old man in a wheelchair stranded in the middle of the crowd. He had lost his friends. People were shouting \u201cbomb! bomb!\u201d, \u201crun! run!\u201d, but there isn\u2019t anywhere to run except back to the gates that you came from, so people were funnelled back towards the planes. I kept on going towards the visa desks, but they were all deserted except for police patrolling with guns who ordered me back. Cameron said that after about 20 minutes wait, officials opened up the visa desks and allowed people to exit - checking their passports despite a scene of disarray. On the other side, in the baggage area, you could see where the bomb had gone off. There was dust everywhere, ceiling panels on the floor, shattered glass, blood and big piles of dusty luggage that had obviously been abandoned by people trying to escape. You do think \u2018shit, if our plane had landed half an hour earlier, that could have been my bag sitting there\u2019. I saw a chap with a bloodied arm, and someone with a rag on his head, but nothing catastrophic, the worst injured people had probably been taken to hospital already. As we came out, we saw the impact of an even bigger bomb on our left, by the start of the taxi rank. There was blood smeared on the floor, sirens, at least seven ambulances. Panels at the side of the building had been blown off, the walls were shredded. The police kept pushing us along, until the cordon ended at a multi-storey car park, where they just left us in chaos. The Guardian\u2019s reporter in Istanbul, Constanze Letsch, has been speaking to people around the airport this morning. Engin S\u00fcrer, a taxi driver said he had driven away from the international terminal around 30 minutes before the explosions and said he was still shaken by the attack. I am not afraid to work, but of course I am nervous. I would have never thought that such an attack would be possible at the airport. He said that he had not been able to reach all of his colleagues on duty at the airport at the time of the explosions, one of which occurred in proximity to a taxi stand outside the international terminal. At least one taxi driver working at the airport at the time, Mustafa Biyikli, has been confirmed dead this morning. Taxi driver Eftal Erdin, 55, said that he was angry after news circulated on social media saying that taxi drivers asked for much higher fees from people stranded at the airport after the attack. He said: Many of our friends drove injured people to the surrounding hospitals for free. Those drivers have no shame, but we want the world to know that Turkey is not a bad place. These attackers want to bring tourism in Turkey to its knees, but we want to make sure that people know that we will not allow for that to happen. Turkish officials have said 13 foreign nationals were killed in the attack on Ataturk airport last night. The rest of the 36 victims were Turkish citizens. An Iranian and a Ukrainian are among the victims who have been identified so far, officials said earlier. Nearly 150 people were wounded. A video posted on Twitter shows the moment one of the Ataturk airport attackers detonated his suicide bomb. The clip, which has no sound, begins with dozens of people milling around as normal. Then they suddenly all begin to run away from something. before a huge blast goes off around them, filling the air with smoke and debris. The prime minister of Albania, whose plane touched down at Ataturk airport minutes after the attacks that killed 36 and wounded 147, has tweeted his condolences to the victims and their families. Edi Rama said in a message on Twitter that he felt \u201cdeep pity for the lost innocent lives in that barbarous act of those who have neither God or hope nor a place among the people.\u201d Rama is making an official visit to Turkey with his finance minister, Arben Ahmetaj, and a delegation. He said all of the planned meetings would go ahead. Shares linked to Turkish tourism have fallen on Wednesday morning, as trading begins in London after the deadly attack at Istanbul\u2019s main airport. The attack is likely to further dent Turkey\u2019s struggling tourism industry, which saw foreign visitors drop more than a third in May for its biggest fall in 22 years. Shares in airport operator TAV fell more than 3 percent while Pegasus Airlines and Turkish Airlines fell 1.5 percent and 2.5 percent respectively. The Istanbul index lost 0.2 percent though the lira managed to rise 0.5 percent against the dollar. \u201cOn the economic side this will again raise concerns about the tourism sector which is struggling, partly due to security concerns and partly because of Russia,\u201d said William Jackson at Capital Economics, referring to Russian sanctions on Turkey that damaged trade and tourism. \u201cBut the market impact overall is not that significant as there is a general improvement in investor sentiment and some of the Brexit turmoil seems to be fading a bit.\u201d China has warned its citizens against travelling to Turkey following the airport attack in Istanbul, Tom Phillips reports. Speaking at a press conference in Beijing on Wednesday the Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hong Lei said the government was urging citizens \u201cnot to go to Turkey for the time being\u201d. Chinese citizens already in the country should \u201cstep up precautions\u201d to ensure their safety. Hong said no Chinese citizens were known to be among the victims. Beijing \u201ccondemns this terror attack in the strongest terms,\u201d he added. Will Carter, a British aid worker caught up in the attacks in Istanbul last night, gives his account of the ordeal. One Ukrainian and one Iranian are among the 36 people killed in the Ataturk airport attack, Reuters is quoting Turkish officials as saying. It\u2019s just a flash so far, we will bring you more information as it comes in. In the meantime, Iran has said it is suspending all flights to Ataturk. Reza Jafarzadeh, director of the public relations at Iran\u2019s Civil Aviation Organization, told the Fars news agency that flights would be suspended until their safety and security can be guaranteed. Turkish authorities reopened the airport in the early hours of Wednesday, just hours after the attacks which killed 36 people. Jafarzadeh added that flights might be resumed by later in the afternoon. Nato stands in solidarity with Turkey, the US.led alliance\u2019s secretary-general has said, as he condemned the \u201chorrific attacks\u201d on Ataturk airport last night. In a statement published on the Nato website, Jens Stoltenberg said: I strongly condemn the horrific attacks at Istanbul\u2019s Ataturk Airport. My thoughts are with the families of the victims, those injured and the people of Turkey. There can be no justification for terrorism. NATO Allies stand in solidarity with Turkey, united in our determination to fight terrorism in all its forms. Germany\u2019s top security official meanwhile described the attack as \u201ccowardly and brutal\u201d. In comments carried by the Associated Press, interior minister Thomas de Maiziere said his thoughts were with the victims and their families, and vowed that \u201cwe will continue our fight against terrorism together with our allies with full force.\u201d De Maiziere said in a statement Wednesday he was \u201cdeeply shocked by the cowardly and brutal attack on Istanbul\u2019s airport.\u201d He says \u201cterrorism has once again shown its ugly face and innocent people have lost their lives.\u201d This AP video shows some of the chaotic scenes which followed the attack on Ataturk airport last night. Security has been tightened around the airport, following the attack by suspected Islamic State extremists. 36 people are confirmed to have been killed, and 147 injured, in a gun and bombing attack on Istanbul\u2019s Atat\u00fcrk international airport on Tuesday evening. Authorities believe three men armed with Kalashnikov rifles attacked the airport, detonating suicide vests when confronted by police officers. No group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack, but Turkey\u2019s prime minister, Binali Yildirim, has said the attack was carried out by Daesh (Islamic State). Yildirim said the men caught a taxi to the airport, launching their assault at the international arrivals terminal. Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan said the attack showed \u201cthe dark face of terror that targets innocent civilians\u201d: This attack does not produce any results, it aims to produce propaganda against our country using the blood and pain of innocent people. The bombing at Atat\u00fcrk \u2013 Turkey\u2019s largest airport, and the third-busiest in Europe \u2013 is the third suicide attack on Istanbul in 2016. Atat\u00fcrk airport has reopened, with incoming and outgoing flights \u2013 which were halted in the immediate aftermath of the attack \u2013 operating this morning, although many are cancelled or delayed. It\u2019s 8am in Istanbul and officials have begun assessing the damage caused by the suicide attackers, reports Associated Press: Workers were brought in to remove debris left by the blast, while in the daylight the damage to the terminal became clearer with even ceiling panels hit. The airport was partially reopened, with the information board inside the airport showing that about one third of scheduled flights have been cancelled, with a host of others delayed. Global reaction against the attack has been swift and condemnatory. Charles Michel, the Belgian prime minister, expressed solidarity following the assault on Brussels airport in March: The White House called the attack \u201cheinous\u201d, saying America remained \u201csteadfast in our support for Turkey\u201d. US Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said: Today\u2019s attack in Istanbul only strengthens our resolve to defeat the forces of terrorism and radical jihadism around the world. We must deepen our cooperation with our allies and partners in the Middle East and Europe to take on this threat. Republican candidate Donald Trump said: Our enemies are brutal and ruthless and will do anything to murder those who do not bend to their will. We must take steps now to protect America from terrorists, and do everything in our power to improve our security to keep America safe. German foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said: We grieve for the victims. We stand by Turkey. Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau tweeted his condolences: Flights in and out of Atat\u00fcrk international airport resumed very quickly after the attack, although investigators continue to work at the scene. Flights between Istanbul and the US was halted for several hours, but the stoppage has now been lifted, according to a US official speaking to Associated Press. Ten flights that were in the air heading from Turkey to the US at the time of the attacks have all now landed. Reports from the Dogan news agency, via AP, say that a plane carrying the Albanian prime minister, Edi Rama, was landing at Atat\u00fcrk at the time of the attack. Rama, who is on an official visit, has been moved to an official residence, the report said, and will travel later to Ankara. Brussels airport, which witnessed its own devastating attack in March, has sent its support and condolences: This is Claire Phipps picking up the live blog from Ben Doherty. The past year has seen a grim toll of suicide attacks in Turkey \u2013 many, but not all, attributed to Isis. 28 June 2016: Suicide attackers killed at least 36 people and wounded more than 140 at Istanbul\u2019s Atat\u00fcrk airport. Turkish officials said the explosions were probably the work of Islamic State. 19 March 2016: A suicide bombing rocked Istanbul\u2019s main pedestrian street killing five people, including the bomber, whom authorities identified as a Turkish national linked to Isis. There was no claim of responsibility from the group. 13 March 2016: A Kurdish woman blew herself up in a car at a busy transport hub in Ankara, killing 37 people in an attack that was also claimed by TAK, also known as the Kurdish Freedom Falcons. 17 February 2016: A suicide car bomb apparently targeting military personnel in Ankara killed 29 people in an attack claimed by TAK. 12 January 2016: A suicide bomber blew himself up in the historic district of Istanbul, killing 12 German tourists. Authorities said the attack was carried out by an Isis-linked Syrian man. 10 October 2015: Twin suicide bombings hit a peace rally outside Ankara\u2019s train station, killing 102 people. There was no claim of responsibility but Turkish authorities blamed the attack on a local cell of Isis. 20 July 2015: A Turkish national who was an ethnic Kurd blew himself up in in the southern border town of Suruc, killing 33 mostly Kurdish activists and wounding nearly 100 others in an attack authorities blamed on Isis. Timeline is via Associated Press. Gunmen armed with kalashnikovs and and suicide vests, stormed the entrance to Istanbul\u2019s Atat\u00fcrk airport shortly after 9pm on Tuesday, killing 36 people and injuring 147. Turkey\u2019s prime minister has said the attack was carried out by agents of Daesh -using the Arabic term for Isis - but the terror network has not yet claimed responsibility for the attack. At least two gunmen were involved in the assault, but authorities suspect a third man was also involved. The men caught a taxi to the airport, emerging at the international arrivals terminal where they opened fire. South African tourist Paul Roos described seeing a gunman shooting at at people indiscriminately. We came right to international departures and saw the man randomly shooting. He was just firing at anyone coming in front of him. He was wearing all black. His face was not masked. I was 50 metres away from him. We ducked behind a counter but I stood up and watched him. Two explosions went off shortly after one another. By that time he had stopped shooting. He turned around and started coming towards us. He was holding his gun inside his jacket. He looked around anxiously to see if anyone was going to stop him and then went down the escalator... we heard some more gunfire and then another explosion, and then it was over. The terrorists were unable to get past the airport\u2019s x-ray security checkpoint, and became involved in a firefight with security and police. Several video clips circulating online purport to show the gunmen attacking the airport. Because of their graphic nature, The Guardian has chosen not to show these, and stresses they have not been verified or corroborated. Sources, however, have told The Guardian that the clips seem authentic. One graphic piece of footage shows people fleeing a man dressed in black and carrying what appears to be a Kalashnikov, who runs into a hall area, before falling, apparently shot, and dropping his weapon, which slides away from him on the floor. A man, believed to be a policeman or security official, approaches the prone gunman, appearing to point a gun at him for several seconds. The standing man then runs from the prone bomber who, after several seconds, detonates the explosive vest he is wearing. The attack on Turkey\u2019s largest airport, and the third-busiest in Europe, is yet another \u2018soft\u2019 target attack, following on from the attack on Brussels airport in March which killed 32 people and injured more than 300. It is also the third attack on Turkey\u2019s biggest city this year. Istanbul has been on a high security alert for months after three deadly attacks in the city blamed on Islamic State jihadis and the Kurdistan Freedom Hawks, a radical offshoot of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party. Less than a month ago a car suicide bomber killed 12 people and wounded several others in the central Istanbul district of Vezneciler. In the aftermath of the attack, Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan said the attack showed \u201cthe dark face of terror that targets innocent civilians\u201d. \u201cThis attack does not produce any results, it aims to produce propaganda against our country using the blood and pain of innocent people\u201d. Erdo\u011fan urged the whole world to unite in the fight against terrorism. \u201cDespite paying a heavy price, Turkey has the power, determination and capacity to continue the fight against terrorism until the end. Today\u2019s attack targeted 79 million Turkish citizens along with 7.5 billion human beings around the world. The bombs that exploded in Istanbul today could have gone off at any airport in any city around the world. \u201cMake no mistake: For terrorist organizations, there is no difference between Istanbul and London, Ankara and Berlin, Izmir and Chicago, or Antalya and Rome. Unless all governments and the entire[ty of] mankind join forces in the fight against terrorism, much worse things than what we fear to imagine today will come true.\u201d Speaking at the airport, Turkish prime minister Binali Yildirim said: \u201cour security force\u2019s findings indicate that this terror attack was done by DAESH but we are still working to determine who is behind the attack\u201d. Yildrim also said it was \u201cnoteworthy that this heinous terror attack took place at a time when [Turkey] successfully fights separatist terror and enters a period of normalisation with our neighbours\u201d, an apparent reference to Turkey\u2019s recent rapprochement with Israel and Russia. Atat\u00fcrk airport was closed for only a matter of hours before being reopened to flights in and out of the country. Departures have resumed from Ataturk Airport People on flights that had flown out of Ataturk Airport just before the terror attacks watched coverage of the assault on live TV. The BBC\u2019s Turkey correspondent, Mark Lowen, who was stuck with fellow passengers on a plane on the tarmac at Istanbul Airport for several hours, has been allowed off, and to go home. Istanbul\u2019s Ataturk Airport is open for flights in and out. Flights from IST have begun landing across the world. According to the private Dogan news agency, a plane carrying Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama was landing at Istanbul\u2019s Ataturk airport when the attack occurred. He was arriving on an official visit. The prime minister and his entourage were safely taken to an official residence. The group was to travel later on Wednesday to Turkey\u2019s capital, Ankara. From Istanbul, The Guardian\u2019s Constanze Letsch reports that while Tuesday night\u2019s attack on Ataturk Airport was the deadliest terror attack in Turkey this year, it was not the first. Istanbul has been on a high security alert for months after three deadly attacks in the city this year blamed on Islamic State jihadis and the Kurdistan Freedom Hawks (TAK), a radical offshoot of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK). Less than a month ago a car suicide bomber killed 12 people and wounded several others in the central Istanbul district of Vezneciler. Globally, terror attacks on the \u2018soft\u2019 target of airports are common, and increasingly so. Below is a list, not comprehensive, of the major attacks on airports over the past five years. June 26, 2016 - Three suspected Islamic State group suicide bombers targeted the international terminal of Istanbul\u2019s Ataturk airport, killing at least 36 people and wounding many others, Turkish officials said. June 12, 2016 - An explosion at a check-in-area of Shanghai\u2019s main international airport injures four people. The blast at Pudong International Airport, China\u2019s second-busiest, was carried out using fireworks stuffed inside empty beer bottles. March 22, 2016 - 16 people are killed in two suicide bombings as bombs ripped through check-in counters at Brussels Airport. The Islamic State group claims responsibility for the attack. A subsequent explosion at a Brussels subway station killed 16 more people. March 7 2016 - A bomb explodes in a piece of luggage at an airport in a central Somali town, wounding three people. Somalia\u2019s Islamic extremist rebels, al-Shabab, claim responsibility for the blast. December 28, 2015 - A suicide car bomb attack killed at least one civilian near the eastern entrance of the Kabul international airport. Another 13 civilians were wounded. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack. March 21, 2015 - A machete-wielding man attacks TSA officers at New Orleans\u2019 international airport and is shot and killed. Authorities later said he was carrying a bag loaded with Molotov cocktails. One of the TSA officers was slightly injured. July 18, 2012 - A bomb explodes on a bus carrying Israeli tourists at the airport in Burgas, Bulgaria, killing five of the tourists, the Bulgarian bus driver and the suicide bomber. Another 35 people are hurt. In 2014, Bulgaria\u2019s interior minister says he is convinced the Shiite militant group Hezbollah was behind the bus bombing. February 27, 2012 - Suicide car bomber struck at the gates of Jalalabad airport in eastern Afghanistan, killing nine people. The Taliban said the attack on the airport, which serves both civilian and international military aircraft, was revenge for the burning of Muslim holy books at an American military base. January 24, 2011 - Suicide bomber blew himself up in the international arrivals area of Moscow\u2019s Domodedovo airport, killing 37 people and wounded 180 others and was claimed by Chechen rebels. Russia\u2019s Federal Investigative Committee later identified the suicide bomber as a 20-year-old from the North Caucasus region. (From Associated Press) Sympathy and solidarity with Turkey from all over the world... \u201cIn one direction there were shots, in the other direction there were bombs. And people ran out as fast as they could. There were people bleeding on the sidewalk.\u201d Eyewitness accounts of the Ataturk Airport terror attacks, from Voice of America. Many countries have issued updated travel warnings in the wake of the assault on Istanbul\u2019s international airport. The United States issued an updated travel warning for Turkey, warning of the threat of terrorist attack, two days before the Ataturk Airport assault. United States of America: The US State Department issued a new travel warning for Turkey on Monday, June 27, two days before three armed suicide bombers stormed the arrivals hall of the country\u2019s busiest airport. The US Department of State warns US citizens of increased threats from terrorist groups throughout Turkey and to avoid travel to southeastern Turkey. Foreign and US tourists have been explicitly targeted by international and indigenous terrorist organizations. As stated in the Worldwide Caution dated March 3, 2016, throughout Europe extremists have targeted large sporting events, theatres, open markets, aviation services, transportation systems, and public venues where people congregate as well as religious sites and high-profile events. US citizens are reminded to review personal security plans and remain vigilant at all times. United Kingdom: The Foreign office has updated its travel advice in the wake of the Istanbul attack, and warns: \u201cthe threat from terrorism remains high\u201d. Terrorist groups, including Kurdish groups, Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL) and far left organisations, continue to plan and carry out attacks. Further attacks are likely. Terrorist groups, including Daesh and the Kurdistan Freedom Falcons (TAK), have publicly threatened to attack tourist sites in Turkey. You should take extra care in public places \u2013 particularly those visited by foreigners. Be vigilant, follow the advice of local security authorities, monitor media reports and keep up to date with this travel advice. Australia: The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has placed Ankara and Istanbul on the second-highest advice level: reconsider your need to travel We advise you to reconsider your need to travel to Ankara and Istanbul because of the high threat of terrorist attack. Pay close attention to your personal security at all times. Monitor the media and other sources about possible new security risks. Terrorists maintain an interest in attacking tourist destinations in Turkey. These places include tourist sites in and around Izmir, Antalya, and nearby coastal areas, tourist locations in Istanbul, Ankara and Adana, as well as other locations in Turkey that are frequented by tourists. You should exercise heightened caution in these areas and be vigilant to your personal safety and surroundings. We advise you to reconsider your need to travel to any area within 50 kilometres of Turkey\u2019s border with Syria and not to travel within 10 kilometres of the border with Syria or to the city of Diyarbakir due to the threat of terrorist attack and kidnapping associated with the ongoing conflict in Syria. Turkish security forces have a strong presence in these border areas. Three gunmen attacked the international terminal of Istanbul\u2019s Atat\u00fcrk airport on Tuesday evening with AK-47 rifles and suicide bombs, killing at least 36 and injuring 147. The Turkish prime minister has said that Islamic State are likely to be behind the attack. No one has claimed responsibility for the attack as yet. Video apparently showing one of the gunmen being shot by a police officer before detonating his suicide vest has emerged. Witnesses have described panic and chaos inside the airport as gunmen, dressed in black, opened fire inside the terminal. Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the attack should serve as a turning point in the global fight against militant groups. Some foreigners are among the victims, but nationalities have not been released. The airport has since reopened. The triple suicide attack in Atat\u00fcrk airport in Istanbul that killed dozens and wounded scores more may well become the deadliest bombing in Turkey this year \u2013 but it is certainly not the first. Police sources quoted in Turkish media said that the attackers were likely affiliated with the Islamic State terror group. Turkish security forces have recently carried out numerous arrests and raids on the group in the country and at its borders, leading some analysts to speculate that Isis might carry out more retaliatory attacks. Read the full analysis here. It seems quite incredible, but Istanbul\u2019s Ataturk Airport is open again... Further to the Prime Minister\u2019s statement: Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim confirmed 36 people have been killed in the attack on Ataturk Airport in Istanbul. He said the victims include some foreigners and that many of the dozens wounded have minor injuries but others are more badly hurt. Yildrim said Turkish security forces had advised that Daesh (the Arabic name for Isis) was behind the attack. But he said the airport had been reopened and air traffic was back to normal from Turkey\u2019s busiest airport. He also said that it was \u201cnoteworthy that this heinous terror attack took place at a time when [Turkey] successfully fights separatist terror and enters a period of normalisation with our neighbours\u201d, an apparent reference to Turkey\u2019s recent rapprochement with Israel and Russia. United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has issued a statement condemning the attacks on Turkey. The Secretary-General condemns today\u2019s terrorist attack at Istanbul\u2019s Ataturk International Airport. He expresses his deepest sympathy and condolences to the families of the victims and to the Government and people of Turkey. He wishes a speedy recovery to those injured. The Secretary-General hopes that the perpetrators of this crime will be identified and brought to justice. He stands firmly by Turkey as it confronts this threat and stresses the need to intensify regional and international efforts to combat terrorism and violent extremism. Facebook has activated its safety check featurein the wake of the explosions in Instanbul. The tool lets users who are at or near the site of a natural disaster or terrorist attack mark themselves and others as safe, as well as check if any of their friends have been affected. Facebook\u2019s Disaster Response page posted a status in relation to the blasts at Ataturk airport: On Tuesday, June 28 at 11:35pm local time in Turkey, we activated Safety Check after the explosions that took place in Istanbul. Our hearts go out to everyone touched by these tragic events.\u201d Safety Check is a simple and easy way to say you\u2019re safe and check on others after a crisis or disaster. We hope the people in the area find the tool a helpful way to let friends and family know they are okay. Facebook uses location services and any registered locations to determine which of its users are in the area, though it has made mistakes in the past. In March, it asked users all over the world if they\u2019d been affected by the suicide bombing in Pakistan. Some received texts to their phones asking \u201cHave you been affected by the explosion?\u201d without any indication of where the danger was. The feature was introduced last year, based on a location tool built after the Fukushima tsunami and nuclear disaster in Japan in 2011, with the intention of being used in the case of natural disasters. The policy surrounding its use was changed after it was activated for the Paris terror attacks. The people of Pakistan have suffered as greatly from Islamist jihadist terror as any nation on earth. Vigils have been held in that country in solidarity with Turkey tonight. Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim speaking outside the Ataturk Airport in Istanbul. He confirmed 36 people were killed in the terror assault on the airport Tuesday night, and said security forces have indicated the attack was carried out by Daesh (using the Arabic name for Isis). Turkish PM says security forces have indicated the attack was carried out by Daesh, the Arabic name for Isis. The Turkish Prime Minister has confirmed 36 people have been killed in the attack on Istanbul Ataturk Airport. Paul Roos, a 77-year-old South African who was due to fly out to Cape Town with his wife, has described witnessing the gunman shooting at random inside the international terminal. He told Reuters: We came right to international departures and saw the man randomly shooting. He was just firing at anyone coming in front of him. He was wearing all black. His face was not masked. I was 50 metres away from him. We ducked behind a counter but I stood up and watched him. Two explosions went off shortly after one another. By that time he had stopped shooting. He turned around and started coming towards us. He was holding his gun inside his jacket. He looked around anxiously to see if anyone was going to stop him and then went down the escalator... we heard some more gunfire and then another explosion, and then it was over. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest: The United States condemns in the strongest possible terms today\u2019s heinous terrorist attack at Istanbul\u2019s Ataturk International Airport in Turkey, which appears to have killed and injured dozens. Ataturk International Airport, like Brussels Airport which was attacked earlier this year, is a symbol of international connections and the ties that bind us together. Our deepest condolences go out to the families and loved ones of those killed, and we wish a speedy recovery to those injured. We remain steadfast in our support for Turkey, our NATO ally and partner, along with all of our friends and allies around the world, as we continue to confront the threat of terrorism. U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said the attack in Istanbul airport was a reminder that the United States \u201ccannot retreat\u201d. Today\u2019s attack in Istanbul only strengthens our resolve to defeat the forces of terrorism and radical jihadism around the world. We must deepen our cooperation with our allies and partners in the Middle East and Europe to take on this threat. Presumptive Republican Party nominee Donald Trump said \u201cthe terrorist threat has never been greater\u201d. Our enemies are brutal and ruthless and will do anything to murder those who do not bend to their will. We must take steps now to protect America from terrorists, and do everything in our power to improve our security to keep America safe. The Guardian has been told by the office of the Turkish justice minister that the number of confirmed dead has now risen to 31. 147 people have been wounded. Turkey\u2019s state broadcaster TRT is reporting 38 people are dead, including 5 police, and at least 120 are injured. Figures of those killed and injured are notoriously difficult to ascertain in the hours after an attack of this nature. These numbers are likely to change again. Several video clips are circulating online purporting to show the airport during and after the attacks. Because of their graphic nature, The Guardian has chosen not to show these, and stresses they have not been verified or corroborated. Sources, however, have told The Guardian that the clips have verisimilitude. One graphic piece of footage posted online purports to be of one of the gunmen inside the terminal. It shows people fleeing a man dressed in black and carrying what appears to be a Kalashnikov, who runs into a hall area, before falling, apparently shot, and dropping his weapon, which slides away from him on the floor. A man, believed to be a policeman or security official, approaches the prone gunman, appearing to point a gun at him for several seconds. The standing man then runs from the prone bomber who, after several seconds, detonates the explosive vest he is wearing. A second clip shows people in the aftermath of the attacks huddling at the back of shops, and crouched down, unsure whether the attacks have ended and if it is safe to move. Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan has issued a statement, warning that the attack on Turkey\u2019s largest city is an attack on the whole world. He urged all governments and all of humankind to \u201cjoin forces in the fight against terrorism\u201d. I strongly condemn the terror attack at Istanbul Ataturk Airport and offer my condolences to the victims\u2019 families and our nation. May Allah bless the souls of everyone who lost their lives in this heinous attack. The attack, which took place during the holy month of Ramadan, shows that terrorism strikes with no regard for faith and values. Nor do terrorists distinguish between their victims. We urge the world, especially Western countries, to take a firm stand against terrorism. Despite paying a heavy price, Turkey has the power, determination and capacity to continue the fight against terrorism until the end. Today\u2019s attack targeted 79 million Turkish citizens along with 7.5 billion human beings around the world. The bombs that exploded in Istanbul today could have gone off at any airport in any city around the world. Make no mistake: For terrorist organizations, there is no difference between Istanbul and London, Ankara and Berlin, Izmir and Chicago, or Antalya and Rome. Unless all governments and the entire[ty of] mankind join forces in the fight against terrorism, much worse things than what we fear to imagine today will come true. The Ataturk Airport attack should serves as a turning point in the fight against terrorism around the world and especially in Western countries. There is still significant confusion surrounding the attacks on Istanbul\u2019s Ataturk Airport Tuesday. Official reports say 28 people have been killed, and 60 injured, but there are credible reports the death toll is likely to rise. Three gunmen, believed to be wearing suicide vests, opened fire at the airport\u2019s international terminal on Tuesday evening. The Guardian\u2019s Constanze Letsch, in Istanbul, and Nicky Woolf, report: A series of deadly explosions tore through crowds at Istanbul\u2019s Atat\u00fcrk international airport on Tuesday evening, leaving at least 28 dead and 60 injured in an attack which officials blamed on the Islamic State terror group. The Associated Press cited an unnamed Turkish official who said that the death toll could be as high as 50. Shortly before the blasts, assailants armed with AK-47 rifles were involved in an exchange of gunfire with security guards outside the airport\u2019s international terminal, according to officials. The gunmen then detonated what are believed to be suicide bombs.",

Istanbul airport attack: Isis behind deaths \u2013 follow the latest updates European leaders meet without Britain Twenty-seven European Union members are expected to reiterate today that the UK must move rapidly to exit the union and should not expect special favours. In a draft communique from the EU summit in Brussels, European leaders also expressed hope that the UK remains \u201ca close partner\u201d but warned that any relationship would be based on \u201crights and obligations\u201d. Earlier, German chancellor Angela Merkel warned that Britain would not be able to cherry-pick the terms of its future relationship with Europe and that the EU would not negotiate with Britain ahead of the mechanism for leaving, known as article 50, being invoked. In his parting words to the summit as a UK prime minister, Cameron warned that the EU must do more to deal with immigration concerns. Lithuanian president Dalia Grybauskaite indicated that Europeans were keen to move on with business. Tuesday was about Cameron, but Wednesday \u201cis about us, what we are going to do about our unity\u201d. EU leaders begin summit talks without UK for first time Scots plan to remain in EU while UK faces leadership vacuum Meanwhile, Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon arrived in Brussels to make her case for Scotland to remain a part of the EU. In London, Brexit leader Boris Johnson said he didn\u2019t believe that if he was elected by the ruling Conservative party to replace David Cameron, he would then need to call a general election. Other potential Conservative leadership candidates include home secretary, Theresa May, and a joint ticket of Stephen Crabb, the pensions secretary, backed by Sajid Javid, the business secretary. The Labour party\u2019s Jeremy Corbyn lost a confidence vote and is now likely to face a challenge to his leadership. Nicola Sturgeon in Brussels to press case for keeping Scotland in EU Brexit walk-back? Secretary of state Kerry raises possibility The US secretary of state John Kerry, in a new, nebulous role as UK-EU mediator, has raised doubts about whether Brexit can ever happen. Kerry, who was in London on Monday, told a conference in Aspen on Tuesday he didn\u2019t think leave campaigners truly believed in Britain\u2019s divorce from Europe. Asked if this meant the Brexit decision could be \u201cwalked back\u201d, and if so how, Kerry said: \u201cI think there are a number of ways.\u201d In the UK, there is some discussion of a second referendum. Diplomatic editor Patrick Wintour considers if there is any way back, and writes that the UK parliament could delay the Brexit process \u201cat every turn\u201d. John Kerry: Brexit could be \u2018walked back\u2019 Benghazi report finds no smoking gun but leaves questions unanswered The 800-page, $7m, Republican-led panel\u2019s congressional report will do little to satisfy those who want to hold Hillary Clinton responsible for the deadly attack on the US mission, but some questions \u2013 among them, was the late ambassador Chris Stevens in the provincial Libyan city to prepare for a visit by the secretary of state? \u2013 go unaddressed. They include: who launched the attack, why did they do it, and were US actions in post-revolutionary Libya a contributory factor? Committee chairman Trey Gowdy accused Clinton and her staff of a \u201cshameful\u201d lack of cooperation. Clinton\u2019s spokesman Brian Fallon retorted: \u201cThe committee report has not found anything to contradict the conclusions of the multiple, earlier investigations.\u201d Benghazi report rakes over old ground, but some answers are still hard to find After supreme court victory, abortion still limited across US Jubilation after the supreme court struck down a law threatening to close half the abortion clinics in Texas disguises the reality that many women are still traveling farther, and spending more money to have abortions than any time in recent memory, writes Molly Redden. Texas, Arkansas, Alabama and Tennessee in the south, and states such as Wisconsin, Michigan and Ohio have lost around 40 clinics in the past five years. Large swathes of Mississippi and Louisiana are also without providers. Reopening clinics in Texas may take years. Abortion access still strained even after landmark US supreme court ruling Lionel Messi\u2019s retirement continues to roil Argentina Argentina\u2019s penalty kick loss to Chile in the Copa America final last weekend caused the 29-year-old Barcelona striker \u2013 one the greatest to have played the sport \u2013 to announce his retirement from international soccer. Messi\u2019s international career highlights the fraught marriage \u2013 and its divisions \u2013 between football and a country that has failed to win a major title in nearly a quarter of a century. Lionel Messi, forgiveness and the retirement that divided Argentina In case you missed it ... The author of a Marvel comic, Civil War II: Choosing Sides, which features Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau, acknowledged this is \u201cbasically Trudeau fan fiction. He seems to be the popular culture association with Canada right now, right behind [Toronto rapper] Drake \u2013 and I probably couldn\u2019t get Drake in the comic,\u201d Chip Zdarsky told the Canadian Press.

Meanwhile, economic growth throughout the 19th century <a href=\"http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/truth-about-trade-history\">was boosted</a> by expansions of transportation, infrastructure, agriculture and resource mining as the United States marched westward across the continent. A steady influx of immigrants meant there was an abundance of cheap labor. For the average American, foreign trade simply wasn\u2019t a pressing issue.</p> <p>Today, trade is a totally different story. Regardless of the benefits or consequences of free trade, it\u2019s undeniable that trade agreements now play a crucial role in international politics. How the United States and China interact with each other depends on how we trade with each other \u2014 and Lincoln certainly never had to face such pressure during his presidential tenure.

However:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I do agree, though, with the analysts who are saying, \u201cLook, the leave campaign just told all kinds of false tales\u201d and advertised on buses and in posters a lot of what they said would happen. And then, as soon as the vote came in, it was like, \u201cJust kidding, you know, we don\u2019t really think we\u2019ll get \u00a3350 million to put in the National Health Service.

So I really fault the [Remain] campaign for not taking on all of those wrong, misleading claims.</p> <p>Now <em>we\u2019re</em> not sitting around letting Donald Trump say whatever he wants to say, we are responding to what he does say, we are pointing out his intemperate and unqualified presence for being our commander-in-chief. And so, I think we are doing what needs to be done in a campaign, where you\u2019re running against someone or some people who will say anything without regard to the truth.</p> </blockquote> <p>Clinton also thought the emotional appeal of Remain was stronger than Leave:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I worried that the campaign to stay in the E.U. was not as emotionally effective in making their case, as the campaign to leave. But I\u2019m no expert on British elections, so I was disappointed, but not surprised.

          "bodyText": "House Republicans investigating the 2012 terrorist attacks in Benghazi, Libya, have found no new evidence to conclude that Hillary Clinton, secretary of state at the time, was culpable in the deaths of four Americans, according to the committee\u2019s final report released this morning. The 800-page document released by the Republicans on the House select committee on Benghazi brought to a close a fiercely partisan, two-year, $7m investigation that included interviews with more than 80 witnesses. The report reveals new details about the night of the attack and concludes that the Obama administration failed to recognize the possibility of it happening. The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee said it is important to \u201clearn the right lessons\u201d from the 2012 Benghazi attack but that \u201cit\u2019s time to move on\u201d after a final 800-page report contained no major new revelations. Barack Obama has warned against financial and global hysteria after Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union, saying that while full European integration may be on pause, cataclysmic changes are unlikely. \u201cThere\u2019s been a little bit of hysteria post-Brexit vote, as if somehow Nato\u2019s gone, the trans-Atlantic alliance is dissolving, and every country is rushing off to its own corner. That\u2019s not what\u2019s happening,\u201d Obama told National Public Radio in an interview that aired today. Trump offered renewed support this evening for the use of torture while repeatedly comparing a proposed free trade agreement to rape. Trump, who has often praised the use of waterboarding as well as speaking positively about alleged war crimes committed by American troops, said at a campaign rally, \u201cWe have to fight fire with fire\u201d, after referencing the penchant for beheadings by Isis. The presumptive Republican nominee claimed that while the terrorist group committed a range of atrocities including beheading and drowning prisoners, the United States was afraid to even use waterboarding. In Trump\u2019s opinion, this left Isis believing that the US was weak and stupid and it needs to \u201cfight so viciously and violently\u201d to combat the threat. Trump also renewed his praise of waterboarding, which was banned by the Bush administration in 2006 as both potentially illegal and ineffective. \u201cWhat do you think about waterboarding?\u201d Trump asked the crowd. They cheered as he gave his answer, \u201cI like it a lot.

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s tough enough.\u201d According to a new Reuters/Ipsos poll released this evening, supporters of presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump are more likely to describe blacks as \u201ccriminal,\u201d \u201cunintelligent,\u201d \u201clazy\u201d and \u201cviolent\u201d than supporters of Hillary Clinton, or supporters of Trump\u2019s Republican opponents in the party\u2019s primary. The poll, conducted over the course of four months, asked 16,000 Americans a set of 21 questions regarding their attitudes about race and racism. In addition to Trump supporters, the poll surveyed supporters of Clinton, her primary opponent Bernie Sanders, and supporters of Ted Cruz and John Kasich. \u201cMr. Trump is an egalitarian who believes in supporting and protecting all people equally,\u201d Stephen Miller, Trump\u2019s senior policy adviser, told Reuters in response to the poll. \u201cThis is a stark contrast to Hillary Clinton, whose policies have been a disaster for African-American and Hispanic citizens.\u201d Nearly half of Trump supporters described blacks as both more \u201cviolent\u201d and \u201ccriminal\u201d than whites. According to the poll, 40% of Trump supporters described blacks as more \u201clazy\u201d than whites. The survey of Americans aged 18 and older, conducted between March and June, showed that 32% of Trump supporters said that whites are closer to the top level of \u201cintelligence\u201d than blacks, and roughly 40% of Trump supporters said that they would place whites higher on the \u201chardworking\u201d scale than blacks. A full 44% of Trump supporters said that whites are more \u201cwell mannered\u201d than blacks. Nebraska senator Ben Sasse has responded to Donald Trump\u2019s comments characterizing the Trans-Pacific Partnership as \u201crape\u201d: Corey Lewandowski, Donald Trump\u2019s former campaign manager won - and then lost - a $1.2 million book deal with megapublisher HarperCollins, according to a report from Politico, after months of negotiating a contract for a tell-all book about his stint as the head of the most surprising campaign in modern political history. The book, tentatively titled \u201cLet Trump Be Trump,\u201d was chatted up with at least five publishers before HarperCollins made its sky-high offer. But, according to Politico, the deal fell apart after Lewandowski refused to share the non-disclosure agreement he signed for Trump with HarperCollins. According to a report from Bloomberg, presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is rounding up a roster of speakers and guests to the upcoming Republican National Convention in Cleveland that will rival ESPN\u2019s primetime lineup in terms of legendary athletes - although the leaked list indicates that Trump is in no rush to make a play for female or minority voters. Iconic Chicago Bears coach Mike Ditka, NASCAR chief Brian France, former Indiana University basketball coach Bobby Knight and onetime world heavyweight champion boxer Mike Tyson are all planning on making appearances in Cleveland, according to Bloomberg, with the roster of celebrities, sports stars and other, um, luminaries expected to grow. Earlier this month, Trump told a crowd in Richmond, Virginia, that he was planning on departing from the typical national convention speakers list of party icons, instead proposing a \u201cwinner\u2019s evening\u201d of athletes to regale the crowd. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do it a little different, if it\u2019s okay,\u201d Trump said at the time. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about getting some of the great sports people who like me a lot,\u201d he continued, namechecking Knight, France and others like New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady. Trump has previously bragged about the endorsement of boxing legend Tyson, who told The Daily Beast that he was endorsing Trump in spite of his proposed ban on Muslim immigration to the US. \u201cMike Tyson endorsed me, I love it,\u201d Trump said in April. \u201cYou know, all the tough guys endorse me. I like that.\u201d Following his comment, Trump was criticized by the Indiana attorney who successfully prosecuted Tyson in 1992 for the rape of a beauty queen. Tyson was sentenced to six years for the crime, and was released after three years. Speaking in St. Clairsville, Ohio, presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump characterized the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) as \u201crape,\u201d calling the international trade agreement \u201cjust a continuing rape of our country.\u201d Acknowledging that \u201cit\u2019s a harsh word but it\u2019s true,\u201d Trump compared the TPP to rape at least three times in the speech. It\u2019s not the first time that Trump has used the imagery of violent sexual assault to characterize matters of international affairs. When discussing the issue of trade with China in Indiana last month, Trump told the audience that \u201cwe can\u2019t continue to allow China to rape our country, and that\u2019s what they\u2019re doing.\u201d The audience applauded Trump\u2019s comparison on both occasions. Hillary Clinton\u2019s statement on this evening\u2019s terror attack Istanbul: Terrorists have struck again in the heart of one of our NATO allies - and all Americans stand united with the people of Turkey against this campaign of hatred and violence. Already, stories of heroism on the part of Turkish police are emerging, as their quick actions to confront the suspects may have prevented an even worse tragedy. Today\u2019s attack in Istanbul only strengthens our resolve to defeat the forces of terrorism and radical jihadism around the world. And it reminds us that the United States cannot retreat. We must deepen our cooperation with our allies and partners in the Middle East and Europe to take on this threat. Such cooperation is essential to protecting the homeland and keeping our country safe. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims, their families, and the Turkish people. Earlier, likely Republican opponent Donald Trump released a statement urging the US government to \u201ctake steps now to protect America from terrorists, and do everything in our power to improve our security to keep America safe.\u201d Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has called on his supporters to \u201cindict\u201d presumptive Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton - or, at least, to do so at the polls this November. Trump, calling Clinton a \u201cworld-class liar\u201d in regards to the 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, that claimed four American lives, writes that on Election Day, \u201cthe American people will finally have the chance to do what the authorities have been too afraid to do over these last 2 decades: indict Hillary Clinton and find her guilty of all charges.\u201d \u201cEvery Election Day, politicians stand trial before the people,\u201d the email states. \u201cThe voters are the jury. Their ballots are the verdict.\u201d The email comes on the heels of the publication of House Republicans\u2019 report investigating the 2012 attacks, which found no new evidence to conclude that Clinton, secretary of state at the time, was culpable. The 800-page document released by the Republicans on the House select committee on Benghazi brought to a close a fiercely partisan, two-year, $7m investigation that included interviews with more than 80 witnesses. The report reveals new details about the night of the attack and concludes that the Obama administration failed to recognize the possibility of it happening. Canada and Mexico have agreed to settle a pair of protracted bilateral disputes in the run-up to a US presidential election in November that could shake ties between the three North American nations. Justin Trudeau said today that Canada would scrap rules obliging Mexican visitors to obtain visas, starting 1 December. The former Conservative government imposed the restrictions in 2009 to stop what it said were bogus asylum claims. In return, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto said Mexico would allow expanded imports of Canadian beef starting in October, ending 13 years of restrictions imposed after a case of mad cow disease was discovered in Canada. The leaders stressed their desire to deepen ties between the two nations, which along with the US are members of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Both countries send the vast majority of their exports to their powerful neighbor. But the future of Nafta could be uncertain after the US election, which looks set to pit Republican Donald Trump against Democrat Hillary Clinton. Trump says he wants to tear up or renegotiate the deal, while Clinton has taken a populist tack on free trade during her campaign. Trudeau said the importance of ties between Canada and Mexico could not be overstated. \u201cIt is my hope that through meetings like this one, we will be able to further strengthen that relationship in the years ahead,\u201d Trudeau said after talks with Pe\u00f1a Nieto. Donald Trump\u2019s statement on this evening\u2019s terror attack Istanbul: Our prayers are with the families of those killed and injured in Istanbul. The whole world is stunned and horrified. The terrorist threat has never been greater. Our enemies are brutal and ruthless and will do anything to murder those who do not bend to their will. We must take steps now to protect America from terrorists, and do everything in our power to improve our security to keep America safe. Likely opponent Hillary Clinton has not yet commented on the attack. Donald Trump raged against globalization and free-trade agreements this afternoon and urged the US \u201cto declare economic independence again\u201d. At a scrap metal facility south of Pittsburgh, the presumptive Republican nominee veered yet again from conservative free-market orthodoxy as he called for the US to withdraw from free-trade deals, including Nafta, the trade agreement with Canada and Mexico. Trump said of the US\u2019s two neighbors: \u201cThey are so used to having their own way. Not with Trump they are not having their own way.\u201d He also promised to take actions many economists believe would start a trade war with China, including introducing retaliatory tariffs, bringing trade cases against the country in the World Trade Organization and labeling China a currency manipulator. \u201cWe already have a trade war and we\u2019re losing badly,\u201d he said. Trump argued that his policies would lead to a restoration of manufacturing in the US. The loss of industrial jobs was not \u201csome natural disaster, it is politician-made disaster\u201d, he said, adding: \u201cIt is the consequence of a leadership class that worships globalism over Americanism ... Our politicians took away from the people their means of making a living and supporting their families.\u201d Trump, whose campaign has long warned against \u201cthe false song of globalism\u201d, criticized growing world economic interdependency that he argued hurt American workers. \u201cOur politicians have aggressively pursued a policy of globalization \u2013 moving our jobs, our wealth and our factories to Mexico and overseas,\u201d said Trump. \u201cGlobalization has made the financial elite who donate to politicians very wealthy. But it has left millions of our workers with nothing but poverty and heartache.\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s reaction to a terrorist attack in Istanbul that has claimed at least 30 lives: In an op-ed penned for the New York Times, Vermont senator and Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders writes that in the waker of the Brexit referendum in the United Kingdom, the Democratic party needs to \u201cwake up\u201d to economic inequality before a similarly catastrophic event befalls the United States. \u201cCould this rejection of the current form of the global economy happen in the United States?\u201d Sanders writes. \u201cYou bet it could.\u201d Citing the closure of American factories, the concentration of global wealth among a tiny cadre of elites and wage decreases among average workers in the US, Sanders declares that \u201cthe global economy is not working for the majority of people in our country and the world. This is an economic model developed by the economic elite to benefit the economic elite. We need real change.\u201d Instead of Donald Trump, whose \u201cdemagogy, bigotry and anti-immigrant sentiment\u201d Sanders calls a close parallel to that of the Leave campaign, the Vermont senator writes that \u201cwe need a president who will vigorously support international cooperation that brings the people of the world closer together, reduces hypernationalism and decreases the possibility of war.\u201d \u201cWe also need a president who respects the democratic rights of the people, and who will fight for an economy that protects the interests of working people, not just Wall Street, the drug companies and other powerful special interests,\u201d Sanders continues, although, nearly three weeks after the last Democratic presidential nominating contest, he refuses to name who that president might be. \u201cIn this pivotal moment, the Democratic Party and a new Democratic president need to make clear that we stand with those who are struggling and who have been left behind,\u201d Sanders concludes. \u201cWe must create national and global economies that work for all, and not a handful of billionaires.\u201d Moments after the editorial was published, Sanders emailed supporters to raise money to transport the delegates who still support him to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia next month. To say that presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and her allied Super-Pacs are outpacing Donald Trump in advertising spending is like saying that Usain Bolt would outpace a Galapagos tortoise in a footrace. According to data compiled by SMG Delta for NBC News, Clinton and her supporters spent $26 million on ads in eight battleground states in the month of June. Trump\u2019s total expenditure: $0. In those eight battleground states - Colorado, Florida, Iowa, North Carolina, New Hampshire, Nevada, Ohio and Virginia - Clinton\u2019s campaign has spent $9 million on advertising in June, with another $17 million purchased by pro-Clinton Super-Pacs like Priorities USA. When future ad reservations - that is, advertising purchased and reserved in the months leading up to Election Day in November - the total rises to a staggering $140 million. Trump\u2019s sole television advertising this month came in the form of $1.2 million from Rebuilding America Now, a Super-Pac that has aired national commercials, but not in battleground states. The highest ranking Democrat in the Senate today called for Florida senator Marco Rubio to pay back his government salary due to his poor attendance record last year, when he missed more votes than any other member of the Senate. \u201cI feel that Marco Rubio should be sued to pay back all the money that the federal government paid him,\u201d Reid told reporters at the Capitol. \u201cHe was never here, and the state of Florida was missing a senator during that time.\u201d \u201cOn the day he announces he\u2019s running for the Senate he misses a very important Foreign Relations meeting,\u201d Reid continued. \u201cHe owes the people, the state of Florida, some time.\u201d Rubio has been on the defense regarding his attendance record in the Senate for nearly a year, after missing 35%, or 120 of the 339 roll votes, during 2015, according to GovTrack. For his part, Rubio has defended his attendance. \u201cI have missed votes this year,\u201d Rubio said at a Republican debate in October. \u201cYou know why? Because while as a senator I can help shape the agenda. Only a president can set the agenda.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not going to fix America with senators and congressmen,\u201d Video: The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee said earlier today that it is important to \u201clearn the right lessons\u201d from the 2012 Benghazi attack but that \u201cit\u2019s time to move on\u201d after a final 800-page report contained no major new revelations. The report, which was two years in the making and cost more than $7m, found the US military largely to blame for a slow response to the attacks. Trump has resumed tweeting after an alarming, nearly 30-hour-long hiatus. He\u2019s easing back in with some retweets of people saying nice things about him: Jay Timmons says that Trump is wrong to call for restrictions on trade to save American manufacturing. What would Jay Timmons know about it? He\u2019s the president and CEO of the national association of manufacturers: Also two candidates who oppose bathroom gender discrimination and want to expand social security and raise some taxes on the wealthy (Trump: \u201cthe wealthy are willing to pay more\u201d). But only one candidate who voted for the Iraq war. What did you think of the recycled aluminum backdrop? Hard to find a positive review on Twitter. Anybody think it made him look practical, pro-manufacturing, as opposed to junky, bin-worthy? We\u2019re not listening to TV to hear what Corey Lewandowski (the campaign manager Trump fired last week) thought of Trump\u2019s speech, but his thought has found us on Twitter. He liked it: The US chamber of commerce, usually a friend of Republicans who usually are its friend, does not like Trump\u2019s protectionism: Click through to a non-Trump-specific apology for free trade, including these lines: On the whole, international trade represents one of the most powerful opportunities America\u2019s small, mid-sized and large businesses have to find new customers. In fact, 95 percent of the world\u2019s consumers live outside our borders, representing nearly limitless expansion opportunities for U.S. businesses and entrepreneurs. Trump ends with the line, \u201cyou\u2019re going to be proud, proud, proud of our country once again\u201d. There\u2019s Corey Lewandowski on CNN to analyze the speech. What\u2019s he saying? Can\u2019t tell, the TV\u2019s on mute. It\u2019s been more than 29 hours since Trump tweeted. The Trump campaign has released prepared remarks for his ongoing speech on trade \u2013 and there are 128 footnotes, including seven for the line, \u201cThe borders will remain open\u201d. Trump interpolates another spontaneous line in his prepared remarks. It\u2019s an aside, an entertainer\u2019s aside. Interpolation in brackets: Seven: If China does not stop its illegal activities, including its theft of American trade secrets... [\u2013 this is very easy. this is so easy. I love saying this\u2013] I will use every lawful presidential power to remedy trade disputes, including the application of tariffs consistent with Section 201 and 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 and Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. \u201cIt should be no surprise then that Hillary Clinton, according to Bloomberg, took a \u2018leading part in drafting the Trans-Pacific Partnership\u2019,\u201d Trump says. He adds a line: \u201cPlease remember that, especially in November.\u201d Trump continues: She praised or pushed the TPP on 45 separate occasions, and even called it the \u201cgold standard\u201d. Hillary Clinton was totally for the TPP just a short while ago, but when she saw my stance, which is totally against, she was shamed into saying she would be against it too \u2013 but have no doubt, she will immediately approve it if it is put before her, guaranteed. Clinton economic adviser Michael Shapiro says that Trump \u201cis taking right from Clinton\u2019s playbook on trade\u201d. Shapiro goes on. The upshot is that Clinton is now against the free trade policies she has promoted throughout her career, in alignment with the mainstream Republicans especially, who must not recognize their presidential candidate on this issue. Trump has Drudge\u2019s attention in a way that the Benghazi committee did not: Trump adds a quote from Lincoln, praising protectionism, to his prepared remarks: And listen to this, the first Republican president, Abraham Lincoln, said, \u201cThe abandonment of the protective policy by the American government will produce want and ruin among our people.\u201d He understood it much better than our current politicians. That why he was Abraham Lincoln, I guess. The economy and world, trade, have changed in the 150 years since Lincoln was president. Robert Gebelhoff is good on why this quote, which Trump has used before, may have applied then but does not now. \u201cThe protectionist policies of the early 19th century existed in a global economy totally different from the one we have today,\u201d he writes: But of course, international trade back then wasn\u2019t nearly as ubiquitous as it is now. Meanwhile, economic growth throughout the 19th century was boosted by expansions of transportation, infrastructure, agriculture and resource mining as the United States marched westward across the continent. A steady influx of immigrants meant there was an abundance of cheap labor. For the average American, foreign trade simply wasn\u2019t a pressing issue. Today, trade is a totally different story. Regardless of the benefits or consequences of free trade, it\u2019s undeniable that trade agreements now play a crucial role in international politics. How the United States and China interact with each other depends on how we trade with each other \u2014 and Lincoln certainly never had to face such pressure during his presidential tenure. [...] My point is this: Historical context matters. You can\u2019t just take sentences from 150 years ago and insert them however you want into contemporary politics. Here again are Trump\u2019s prepared remarks. He\u2019s currently in the Brexit section, sticking closely to the script. He says: Our friends in Britain recently voted to take back control of their economy, politics and borders. I was on the right side of that issue - with the people - while Hillary, as always, stood with the elites, and both she and president Obama predicted that one wrong. Now it\u2019s time for the American people to take back their future. Trump is standing in front of a wall of crushed things. Here\u2019s Trump: Economics journalists are chewing on Trump\u2019s imminent speech on trade. The Washington Post\u2019s Jim Tankersley finds it very Sanders-like: The Donald Trump campaign has released his prepared remarks for a rally in Monessen, Pennsylvania, outside Pittsburgh, to begin in about an hour. Politico has posted the transcript. The speech is topical, tailored for a local audience, about somebody else besides the candidate \u2013 all in all quite coherent and forceful and not characteristic of this campaign thus far. Trump will say in part: The legacy of Pennsylvania steelworkers lives in the bridges, railways and skyscrapers that make up our great American landscape. But our workers\u2019 loyalty was repaid with betrayal. Our politicians have aggressively pursued a policy of globalization - moving our jobs, our wealth and our factories to Mexico and overseas. Trump plans to say the \u201csystem\u201d is rigged against American workers and the people who rigged it want Hillary Clinton to be president so their profiteering can continue uninterrupted. The speech also articulates a vision of hope, instead of Trump\u2019s accustomed gospel of American decay. The new motto is \u201cBelieve in America\u201d. Hillary Clinton and her friends in global finance want to scare America into thinking small - and they want to scare the American people out of voting for a better future. My campaign has the opposite message. I want you to imagine how much better your life can be if we start believing in America again. Trump plans to discuss the Brexit: Our friends in Britain recently voted to take back control of their economy, politics and borders. I was on the right side of that issue - with the people - while Hillary, as always, stood with the elites, and both she and president Obama predicted that one wrong. Trump calls for the country to go back to the future: Now it\u2019s time for the American people to take back their future. That\u2019s the choice we face. We can either give in to Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign of fear, or we can choose to Believe In America. In the speech, for insight on international trade, Trump plans to invoke the wisdom of... the founding fathers: Our Founding Fathers Understood Trade George Washington said that \u201cthe promotion of domestic manufactur[ing] will be among the first consequences to flow from an energetic government.\u201d Trump will hit Clinton for her flip-flop on the Trans-Pacific Partnership: Hillary Clinton was totally for the TPP just a short while ago, but when she saw my stance, which is totally against, she was shamed into saying she would be against it too \u2013 but have no doubt, she will immediately approve it if it is put before her, guaranteed. Read it all here. Believe in America. Clinton takes a question from the media. It\u2019s about the Benghazi committee report. \u201cI have said from the very beginning, nothing is more important than the safety and the security of our diplomats and development officials... and I said this when I testified for 11 hours, that no one... has lost more sleep about the lives that we lost... we owe it to those brave Americans to make sure that we learn the right lessons from this tragedy. \u201cI understand that after more than two years and $7m spent by the congressional Benghazi committee, it had to today report it found nothing, nothing to contradict the conclusions of the independent accountability board.. or of the prior multiple investigations... \u201cWhile this unfortunately took on a partisan tinge, I want to stay focused on... the important work of diplomacy and development. I\u2019ll leave it to others to characterize this report but I think it\u2019s pretty clear it\u2019s time to move on. Clinton is talking about student debt. She calls it an individual burden and an economic burden. Every student in America should have the chance to learn computer science before graduation from high school, she says. \u201cYou know when I used to visit schools... I would have what I called the Chelsea test. In other words would I send Chelsea to this school? .. So now I\u2019m a grandmother and I have the Charlotte and Aidan test. There is such a divide,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking.\u201d She calls for access to high-speed Internet for all homes. Where the magic will happen next month: Here\u2019s video of the Republican news conference on the Benghazi report earlier: The Clinton event has begun. She\u2019s taking the lectern now. Scroll down for the live video stream, or click here. \u201cI am blown away and really happy to be here,\u201d she begins. She\u2019s at Galvanize, a tech startup incubator. Disrupter. When was the last time Donald Trump went 27 hours without tweeting? @realdonaldtrump has fallen uncharacteristically silent. He did not tweet a reaction to yesterday\u2019s Supreme Court decision on abortion. He did not tweet his campaign\u2019s announcement this morning of new communications hires. He did not tweet reaction to polls this morning showing him trailing Hillary Clinton. He did not tweet the Benghazi committee report. Trump has 9.37m followers on Twitter, all waiting to hear from him, but he is not obliging. Trump is scheduled to appear at a rally outside Pittsburgh sometime after 2.30 pm. His campaign has said he will make a major speech about trade policy. We\u2019ll carry the speech live here. The cameras are live on the Clinton event in Denver. She\u2019s chatting now backstage with local business people about commodities trading and for some reason we can hear it. Update: the feed cut out. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled by this,\u201d Clinton said. Here\u2019s that video stream again: So many options to choose from: An investigation by the Washington Post has raised questions about the millions of dollars Donald Trump claims to have secretly given to charity. The top question: is he lying? Reporter David Fahrenthold tracks Trump\u2019s claims and notes, \u201cIf he honored all those pledges, Trump\u2019s gifts to charity would have topped $8.5 million.\u201d But: But in that time, public records show, Trump donated about $2.8 million \u2014 less than a third of the pledged figure \u2014 through a foundation set up to give his money away. And there is no evidence that Trump has given to his foundation lately: The last record of any gift from him to his foundation was in 2008. [...] That research showed that Trump has a long-standing habit of promising to give to charity. But Trump\u2019s follow-through on those promises was middling \u2014 even at the beginning, in his early days as a national celebrity. Read the full report here. Bernie Sanders tells NBC News that he hasn\u2019t yet endorsed Hillary Clinton because he\u2019s still fighting \u201cto transform America\u201d. Sanders has said he will vote for Clinton, and polls have indicated that more than 80% of Sanders backers already plan to vote for Clinton. \u201cPolitics is not a baseball with winners and losers,\u201d Sanders added. The Smoking Gun flags an email in which Clinton aides \u2013 via email?!? \u2013 track reporters at a Clinton event. The email was obtained through a hacker attack on Clinton aides \u2013 by the same hackers, reportedly Moscow-backed, who reportedly took a copy of a Donald Trump opposition research file from the Democratic national committee. The Smoking Gun reports: [Research firm SecureWorks] contends that the hacking campaign has targeted\u201cindividuals managing Clinton\u2019s communications, travel, campaign finances, and advising her on policy.\u201d The assault, which reportedly began in mid-March, relied on a spoofed Gmail log-in page in an attempt to deceive victims. That gambit tricked at least one Clinton volunteer, Sarah Hamilton, records show. Hamilton\u2019s Gmail account appears to have been breached in late-March and hackers copied a large swath of campaign e-mails, memos, and documents. Hamilton, former spokesperson for Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, has aided the Clinton campaign\u2019s press operation. Contacted today, Hamilton (pictured below) declined comment on the hack. Hillary Clinton is scheduled to appear any moment at a rally in Denver, Colorado. Here\u2019s a live video stream: Barack Obama has rejected Donald Trump\u2019s argument that Americans should see the Brexit vote as an example and likewise move to \u201ctake their country back.\u201d \u201cMr Trump embodies global elites and has taken full advantage of it his entire life. So he\u2019s hardly a legitimate spokesman for a populist surge from working-class people on either side of the Atlantic,\u201d Obama told NPR in an interview published Tuesday. Obama admitted, however, that there were similarities between American anxieties about immigration and \u201ca loss of national identity\u201d and British anxieties. The subtext for Trump\u2019s slogan, \u201cMake America great again\u201d, \u201cis that somehow a bunch of foreigners and a lot of funny-looking people are coming here and changing the character of the nation,\u201d which is a sentiment also to be found in the UK, France and elsewhere in Europe, Obama said: I think there is a xenophobia, an anti-immigration sentiment that\u2019s flashing up not just in Great Britain but throughout Europe that has some parallels with what Mr Trump has been trying to stir up here.\u201d Barack Obama cautions against \u201chysteria\u201d over the Brexit vote, in an interview with NPR published Tuesday. \u201cIs there a danger that Europe will turn inward?\u201d the president is asked. \u201cI think this will be a moment in which all of Europe says, \u2018alright, let\u2019s take a breath\u2019,\u201d he replies: Well, I think that, the, best way to think about this is that a pause button has been pressed on the project of full European integration I would not overstate it. THere\u2019s been a little bit of hysteria post-Brexit vote, as if Nato\u2019s gone, and the Trans-Atlantic alliance is dissolving, and every country\u2019s rushing to its own corner. That\u2019s not what\u2019s happening. What\u2019s happening is you had a European project that\u2019s probably moving faster and without as much consensus as it should have. [...] I think this will be a moment in which all of Europe says, \u2018alright, let\u2019s take a breath. How do we maintain some of our national identities, how do we preserve the benefits of integration, and how do we deal with some of the frustrations that our own voters are feeling?\u2019 But the basic core values of Europe, the tenets of liberal, market-based democracies, those aren\u2019t changing. The interests that we have in common with Europe remain the same. And our concerns internationally are the same. [...] I don\u2019t anticipate that there\u2019s gonna be major, cataclysmic changes as a result of this. Keep in mind that Norway is not a member of the European Union. But they are one of our closest allies. [...] Republican unity watch update: Much has been made of the the implications for the American election of the British decision to leave the European Union, although persuasive analysis warns that such links may be exaggerated. The Brexit has influenced the American election in at least this way: Hillary Clinton was watching closely, and she faults the Remain campaign for not having a rapid response \u2013 or any response \u2013 to take on the misleading assertions and false promises of the Leave campaign. Clinton told LinkedIn that she did not see Brexit \u201cas having a direct impact\u201d on the US presidential election. However: I do agree, though, with the analysts who are saying, \u201cLook, the leave campaign just told all kinds of false tales\u201d and advertised on buses and in posters a lot of what they said would happen. And then, as soon as the vote came in, it was like, \u201cJust kidding, you know, we don\u2019t really think we\u2019ll get \u00a3350 million to put in the National Health Service. And you know, we still are going to have immigrants coming from non-E.U. countries\u201d and on and on. So I really fault the [Remain] campaign for not taking on all of those wrong, misleading claims. Now we\u2019re not sitting around letting Donald Trump say whatever he wants to say, we are responding to what he does say, we are pointing out his intemperate and unqualified presence for being our commander-in-chief. And so, I think we are doing what needs to be done in a campaign, where you\u2019re running against someone or some people who will say anything without regard to the truth. Clinton also thought the emotional appeal of Remain was stronger than Leave: I worried that the campaign to stay in the E.U. was not as emotionally effective in making their case, as the campaign to leave. But I\u2019m no expert on British elections, so I was disappointed, but not surprised. Because it\u2019s clearly their decision, but there\u2019s been a lot of second guessing and a lot of regret being expressed now that I think shows that the campaign never really fully answered a lot of the issues that the country would have to face if they voted to leave. Read the full interview here. The news conference on the Republicans\u2019 Benghazi report has finished. Committee chairman Trey Gowdy assiduously avoided making any flat statements of blame, directed at Hillary Clinton or anyone else, for the Benghazi disaster. He said there was a \u201ccontrast\u201d between what was happening in Washington and what was happening on the ground in Libya. He invited people to read the report and connect the dots for themselves. The report is here: Gowdy is asked again about who is most at fault in the Benghazi affair. Again he resists naming Clinton: I\u2019m not in the business of apportioning culpability. It looks like there\u2019s enough to go around. Gowdy is asked whether the American people should conclude from the report that Hillary Clinton is unfit for the presidency. \u201cI think the American people ought to look at it... what conclusions they draw after reading it is up to them,\u201d he says. Matt Drudge, the curator of the conservative id, has the Benghazi report below the fold, with no sirens: Gowdy takes questions. First question: \u201cWas this the best use of taxpayer dollars and your time\u201d? Gowdy says \u201cwho says that stuff was new? Nobody has ever reported that nothing was headed to Benghazi... god knows nobody\u2019s ever reported who actually evacuated our reports... you didn\u2019t know about any of the emails from ambassador Stevens... from Sidney Blumenthal... that the world\u2019s most powerful military did not meet a single self-imposed timeline. All of that is new.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m actually proud of what we found and it\u2019s new.\u201d Gowdy was asked if the four Americans killed in the Benghazi attack could have been saved if Washington had acted differently. \u201cClearly you couldn\u2019t have saved two of them,\u201d Gowdy says. But as for two security personnel \u2013 \u201cthere were three [military] assets that made it there [to the scene of the attack\u201d, Gowdy says. A group from Tripoli and two unarmed drones. \u201cI\u2019m not going to make a reckless allegation that Ty Woods\u2019 and Glen Doherty\u2019s lives could have been saved,\u201d Gowdy says. \u201cThe Democrats\u2019 mantra all along was that there was no new information. Well there\u2019s indisputably new information.\u201d \u201cThis investigation has uncovered a ton of new information,\u201d says Representative Martha Roby. At the end of the day, no military assets were ever moving toward Benghazi. The bottom line is that Washington failed to have our guys\u2019 backs when we needed it... this represents incompetence, indifference or both. Next up is Representative Susan Brooks of Indiana. \u201cThis has been an incredible task to undertake,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat we didn\u2019t know until this investigation was that the state department made a conscious decision to keep the Benghazi compound off the radar.\u201d The Clinton campaign has issued a statement criticizing the Benghazi committee\u2019s failure to issue a bipartisan report and saying \u201cthis Committee\u2019s chief goal is to politicize the deaths of four brave Americans\u201d. Here\u2019s the statement: The Republicans on the House Benghazi Committee are finishing their work in the same, partisan way that we\u2019ve seen from them since the beginning. In refusing to issue its report on a bipartisan basis, the Committee is breaking from the precedent set by other Congressional inquiries into the Benghazi attacks. And in leaking out select portions from their report in the middle of the night, without even allowing some of the committee\u2019s own members to see it, the Republican members are clearly seeking to avoid any fact-checking of their discredited, conspiracy theories. After more than two years and more than $7 million in taxpayer funds, the Committee report has not found anything to contradict the conclusions of the multiple, earlier investigations. This report just confirms what Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and even one of Trey Gowdy\u2019s own former staffers admitted months ago: this Committee\u2019s chief goal is to politicize the deaths of four brave Americans in order to try to attack the Obama administration and hurt Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. - Spokesman Brian Fallon Representative Lynn Westmoreland of Georgia speaks. \u201cWe produced new evidence that will allow the citizens of this country to take all the different pieces that came out through all the investigations and tie those things together,\u201d he says. If you will read the report you will see that what was going on in Washington at 10.08 [pmET] when the secretary made her first statement, we had men on the roof of the annex trying to protect their lives and the lives in Benghazi. We have new facts... if our fellow citizens read this, they\u2019re going to come up with a new opinion about what happened.\u201d Gowdy asserts \u201cThere is new information on what happened in Benghazi. And that information should fundamentally change the way you view what happened in Benghazi\u201d \u2013 but it\u2019s not clear what that information is. Gowdy says \u201cWashington\u201d \u201chad access to real-time information but that real-time information did not inform and instruct the decisions made in Washington.\u201d He says there was a \u201ccontrast between what was happening in Benghazi and what was happening in Washington\u201d, a contrast crystallized in a two-hour meeting at the White House. No help could have arrived in time to prevent the death of the four American personnel at Benghazi because \u201cnot a single wheel of a single US military asset had even turned toward Libya\u201d as the attack unfolded, or for hours afterward, Gowdy says. Benghazi committee chair Trey Gowdy is speaking now about the Benghazi report. Click through to read it: Here\u2019s a live video stream. \u201cRead the report,\u201d Gowdy urges people. He says to compare what happened in Benghazi with \u201cdecisions made and not made in Washington\u201d: Hello, and welcome to our live-wire coverage of the 2016 race for the White House. Hillary Clinton appears to be widening her national lead over Donald Trump, according to an NBC News/SurveyMonkey tracking poll, which now has Clinton up eight points, 49-41, against Trump. Last week she was up six points in the poll, which is in line with current averages. Clinton had a six-point lead on Trump, 42-36, when Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and Green candidate Jill Stein were included in the NBC poll, which was conducted online from 20-26 June. The head of election polling for SurveyMonkey points out that the biggest Clinton gain in the poll was among the youth: Potentially alarming for Trump, a 52% majority of Republicans told the pollster they would have preferred someone else as nominee. Clinton also scored quite poorly in this regard \u2013 45% of Democrats told the pollster they would have preferred someone else. There\u2019s more fresh polling news out there: an ABC News/Washington Post poll found that Clinton leads Trump 50-39 in terms of trust to handle terrorism, and respondents thought Clinton did a better job of responding to the Orlando mass shooting of 12 June: Trump silent On the trail today, Trump has a rally scheduled outside Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a state where he hopes to score a key upset in a redrawn electoral map. Trump has been uncharacteristically silent on social media in the past 24 hours; he has not commented on the latest polling, for example. Neither has he commented on a major supreme court ruling Monday striking down a restrictive anti-abortion law in Texas. Communications help is on the way, however. On Tuesday morning, Trump announced major new hires, including former Ted Cruz communications pro Jason Miller, who will serve as Trump\u2019s senior communications adviser and \u201cwork with the existing team to build out a full Communications Department to deliver victory this November\u201d, the Trump campaign said. Before starting the gig, Miller deleted mean things he said about Trump on Twitter, but other past statements were circulating: Trump also wants to hire state directors this week, Bloomberg reports (why rush it?): Benghazi committee to issue report There is a possible cloud on the horizon this morning for Clinton: the US House select committee on the events surrounding the 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, is scheduled to issue its authoritative report Tuesday morning. Democrats on the committee, which like Congress at large is currently controlled by Republicans, issued a separate dissenting report on Monday. Leaked excerpts indicate the official committee report will find that US facilities at Benghazi were not safe, that intelligence reports made that fact clear and that Clinton, as secretary of state, failed to act. Trump denies reversal on Muslim ban The Trump campaign pushed back hard on Monday on reports that the presumptive Republican nominee was modifying his proposed ban on Muslims entering the US. \u201cThis is not accurate,\u201d said Hope Hicks, a spokesperson for the campaign. \u201cThere has been no change from the exchanges over the weekend.\u201d Thanks for reading, and please join us in the comments.",

Momentum, set up after Corbyn\u2019s victory last September to build on the enthusiasm generated during his campaign, held rallies in Newcastle, Leeds and Bristol on Tuesday after the vote. Thousands had demonstrated outside parliament on Monday night. Corbyn has a strong chance of fending off a challenge if he can retain the support of the unions and the loyalty of the hundreds of thousands of members. He won in September with 59.5% of the vote. MPs seeking to remove him are hoping much of that support has been eroded by discontent with his performances against David Cameron at prime minister\u2019s questions, by scepticism over his ability to win a general election and by his lacklustre campaign in support of remain in the European Union referendum.

My children consider themselves both British and French. I am a committed European,\u201d he says. \u201cDuring the referendum campaign I saw no support from Corbyn for remain, even though he professed to support it. He didn\u2019t participate in any of the TV debates, was interviewed possibly twice. I suspect he is unable to debate, an essential skill for any party leader. </p> <p>\u201cAs far as I can see, he enjoys going to meetings of the devoted and expounding his views, but that changes nothing. Any leader has to be constantly exposed to the general public (and not just at meetings in town halls), which he never is, nor was during the referendum. I feel extremely let down.</p> <p>\u201cThere are plenty who could make a better job of being leader: Tom Watson, Angela Eagle, Kinnock, Benn. I would not want to see any of the candidates from the last leadership election standing again.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Vicky Ratcliffe, 37, is a community engagement specialist in London</strong>. She does not support Corbyn. </p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t, and will never, view him as a viable prime minister. I was willing to give him a chance to prove me wrong, yet he\u2019s done exactly the opposite. His participation in the remain campaign was reluctant at best, and obstinate sabotage at worst. </p> <p>\u201cWe need new blood \u2013 young blood. We need the passion we\u2019ve seen the SNP develop north of the border \u2013 a British Justin Trudeau if possible. Labour must search its ranks for a passionate, fresh-faced and intelligent individual and give them the support of senior members who have the experience to guide them to No 10.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is an absolute betrayal of the youth of this country not to have fought tooth and nail to stay in Europe</p> <footer> <cite>Morwenna, London</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Morwenna, 44, is a teacher in London</strong>.

And his current behaviour in refusing to accept his performance was not good enough, and being willing to destroy the party I\u2019ve been a member of all my life by causing more and more rift between its wings, is disgusting. It is one of the most vain and repellent things I have seen in Labour politics \u2013 he must resign and he must do it today. </p> <p>\u201cI feel betrayed by the trust I put in his vision and horrified at what is happening to my party. There needs to be a unifying candidate with a strong voice, fantastic head for detail and powerful ability to negotiate. In some ways I\u2019d like a new generation, but we probably need a really big hitter from the past so they have the gravitas. It would also be very good if they came from a strong working class background to reconnect with our lost base. Angela Eagle could be a choice.

He joined the Labour party after the 2015 general election.</p> <p>He supports Corbyn: \u201cHe was elected with an overwhelming mandate from Labour members \u2013 the largest in recent history. As a leader sceptical of the European Union whilst still able to recognise the benefits it brings, he put forward a rational and composed message to remain that was still cognisant of the anxieties of those who supported leaving the EU. This makes him best placed to lead the Labour party in a country that just voted leave. Or, at the very least, far better placed to lead than those Labour MPs so uncritical of the EU they face no hope of reconnecting with those who voted to leave.\u201d</p> <p>But he adds: \u201cWhilst I still support Corbyn, the sheer insubordination of swaths of the PLP may make leadership untenable. A successor supported and endorsed by Corbyn could help to overcome some of these problems. Someone like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/clive-lewis\">Clive Lewis</a> could fit this role. However, the opposition to Corbyn within the PLP appears more ideological than personal. It is unclear whether such a move would work.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Stuart Basson, 57, from Chesterfield,</strong> is a local government officer who joined Labour under John Smith, left under Tony Blair, and rejoined just after Corbyn became leader.</p> <p>He is unsure about Corbyn\u2019s continued leadership. \u201cI\u2019m not convinced by his performance in the EU referendum, but if not him, then who? Burnham? David Miliband? Watson? It needs to be someone with principles who can engage the public and also, sadly, play the media\u2019s game.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I don\u2019t think he\u2019s doing a great job, but his mandate is hard to argue with</p> <footer> <cite>Nick, Stevenage</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Nick, 48, an engineer based in Stevenage</strong>, left the party after the decision to go to war in Iraq, but rejoined when Ed Miliband took over as leader.

Also, the other members of his shadow cabinet should have helped him when they recognised he was not doing a great job. He made it plain that his leadership (such as it is/was) would be consensual \u2013 they should have stepped up and helped, rather than carping and sniping.</p> <p>\u201cI work in an environment where if you can see something needs doing, you do it, rather than complain that the person who should be doing it is making a hash of it.

He also didn\u2019t campaign hard enough to keep us in the EU. I think unless he begins to show more of a public face and talk to the media soon, he should go. I am, as a member, considering leaving the party: I just have no idea where the party\u2019s leader stands on anything at the moment \u2013 not even if he voted to remain in the EU.</p> <p>\u201cIn terms of possible new leadership for Labour, the only MP who fills me with confidence or has spoken eloquently on the mess we find ourselves in is Emily Thornberry.\u201d</p> <p><strong>David Heseltine, 30, from Scunthorpe</strong>, says he is firmly behind Corbyn but is concerned for his future as leader. </p> <p>\u201cThese betrayals by his ministers make it increasingly difficult for me to see any way out of this mess other than resignation. The only hope I have is that [John] McDonnell puts his name forward as his replacement. It\u2019s sad that it\u2019s come to this, because I truly believe that Corbyn represents the future direction for Labour, but McDonnell is more charismatic and he possibly has a bit more of a chance to unite the party (although he\u2019d still be divisive amongst the PLP).\u201d</p>",

I would support any leader who I felt could lead us and maintain our core values at the same time, which I feel that Corbyn has failed to do.\u201d Peter Davies, 67, lives in Lincolnshire and joined the Labour party after the last election in order to participate in choosing a new leader \u2013 giving his support to Corbyn. He no longer supports Corbyn\u2019s leadership. \u201cMy wife was French, I am British. My children consider themselves both British and French. I am a committed European,\u201d he says. \u201cDuring the referendum campaign I saw no support from Corbyn for remain, even though he professed to support it. He didn\u2019t participate in any of the TV debates, was interviewed possibly twice. I suspect he is unable to debate, an essential skill for any party leader. \u201cAs far as I can see, he enjoys going to meetings of the devoted and expounding his views, but that changes nothing. Any leader has to be constantly exposed to the general public (and not just at meetings in town halls), which he never is, nor was during the referendum. I feel extremely let down. \u201cThere are plenty who could make a better job of being leader: Tom Watson, Angela Eagle, Kinnock, Benn. I would not want to see any of the candidates from the last leadership election standing again.\u201d Vicky Ratcliffe, 37, is a community engagement specialist in London. She does not support Corbyn. \u201cI don\u2019t, and will never, view him as a viable prime minister. I was willing to give him a chance to prove me wrong, yet he\u2019s done exactly the opposite. His participation in the remain campaign was reluctant at best, and obstinate sabotage at worst. \u201cWe need new blood \u2013 young blood. We need the passion we\u2019ve seen the SNP develop north of the border \u2013 a British Justin Trudeau if possible. Labour must search its ranks for a passionate, fresh-faced and intelligent individual and give them the support of senior members who have the experience to guide them to No 10.\u201d Morwenna, 44, is a teacher in London. She joined the party in 1990 and supported Corbyn\u2019s leadership campaign in 2015, but has lost confidence since the referendum. \u201cIt is an absolute betrayal of the youth of this country not to have fought tooth and nail to stay in Europe,\u201d she says. \u201cCorbyn and his team appear to have behaved shockingly to undermine Labour\u2019s position. And his current behaviour in refusing to accept his performance was not good enough, and being willing to destroy the party I\u2019ve been a member of all my life by causing more and more rift between its wings, is disgusting. It is one of the most vain and repellent things I have seen in Labour politics \u2013 he must resign and he must do it today. \u201cI feel betrayed by the trust I put in his vision and horrified at what is happening to my party. There needs to be a unifying candidate with a strong voice, fantastic head for detail and powerful ability to negotiate. In some ways I\u2019d like a new generation, but we probably need a really big hitter from the past so they have the gravitas. It would also be very good if they came from a strong working class background to reconnect with our lost base. Angela Eagle could be a choice. I\u2019d really like Nicola Sturgeon, but I guess we can\u2019t have her.\u201d It\u2019s complicated Robbie Pye is a 28-year-old PhD student in Sheffield. He joined the Labour party after the 2015 general election. He supports Corbyn: \u201cHe was elected with an overwhelming mandate from Labour members \u2013 the largest in recent history. As a leader sceptical of the European Union whilst still able to recognise the benefits it brings, he put forward a rational and composed message to remain that was still cognisant of the anxieties of those who supported leaving the EU. This makes him best placed to lead the Labour party in a country that just voted leave. Or, at the very least, far better placed to lead than those Labour MPs so uncritical of the EU they face no hope of reconnecting with those who voted to leave.\u201d But he adds: \u201cWhilst I still support Corbyn, the sheer insubordination of swaths of the PLP may make leadership untenable. A successor supported and endorsed by Corbyn could help to overcome some of these problems. Someone like Clive Lewis could fit this role. However, the opposition to Corbyn within the PLP appears more ideological than personal. It is unclear whether such a move would work.\u201d Stuart Basson, 57, from Chesterfield, is a local government officer who joined Labour under John Smith, left under Tony Blair, and rejoined just after Corbyn became leader. He is unsure about Corbyn\u2019s continued leadership. \u201cI\u2019m not convinced by his performance in the EU referendum, but if not him, then who? Burnham? David Miliband? Watson? It needs to be someone with principles who can engage the public and also, sadly, play the media\u2019s game.\u201d Nick, 48, an engineer based in Stevenage, left the party after the decision to go to war in Iraq, but rejoined when Ed Miliband took over as leader. He voted for Yvette Cooper in the last leadership election. He says he is unsure whether Corbyn should continue. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s doing a great job, but his mandate is hard to argue with. Also, the other members of his shadow cabinet should have helped him when they recognised he was not doing a great job. He made it plain that his leadership (such as it is/was) would be consensual \u2013 they should have stepped up and helped, rather than carping and sniping. \u201cI work in an environment where if you can see something needs doing, you do it, rather than complain that the person who should be doing it is making a hash of it. Senior Labour MPs should do the same. I\u2019d like to see Stella Creasy as leader: she\u2019s principled, a good communicator, and not tainted by the past.\u201d Chloe Barker, 32, an arts producer in Gateshead, joined after the general election in May 2015 and voted for Jeremy Corbyn as leader, but is now unsure of his future. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether Jeremy Corbyn should stay on as leader of the Labour party, because he has made no speech (except a very short one on the weekend, where he said nothing) nor set out plans on how we go forward since the referendum result. He also didn\u2019t campaign hard enough to keep us in the EU. I think unless he begins to show more of a public face and talk to the media soon, he should go. I am, as a member, considering leaving the party: I just have no idea where the party\u2019s leader stands on anything at the moment \u2013 not even if he voted to remain in the EU. \u201cIn terms of possible new leadership for Labour, the only MP who fills me with confidence or has spoken eloquently on the mess we find ourselves in is Emily Thornberry.\u201d David Heseltine, 30, from Scunthorpe, says he is firmly behind Corbyn but is concerned for his future as leader. \u201cThese betrayals by his ministers make it increasingly difficult for me to see any way out of this mess other than resignation. The only hope I have is that [John] McDonnell puts his name forward as his replacement. It\u2019s sad that it\u2019s come to this, because I truly believe that Corbyn represents the future direction for Labour, but McDonnell is more charismatic and he possibly has a bit more of a chance to unite the party (although he\u2019d still be divisive amongst the PLP).\u201d",
