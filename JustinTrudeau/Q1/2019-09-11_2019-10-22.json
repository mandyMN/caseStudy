Here is an updated version of the summary my colleague <strong>Kate Lyons </strong>posted earlier. </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Justin Trudeau won a second term as prime minister of Canada in a narrow victory that will mean he will lead a minority government. Its worth noting that minority governments in Canada do not usually last longer than two years.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Trudeau\u2019s Liberal Party led in 146 out of 304 electoral districts that had reported results by about 10:30pm Toronto time on Monday, short of the 170 needed to security a majority government.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The New Democratic Party were widely expected to support the Liberals in some way, but the nature of their future relationship in the Canadian parliament remains to be seen and there was speculation that the left-wing party would pull Trudeau in a more progressive direction.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>However, the party led by Jagmeet Singh suffered a blow on election day, dropping to 24 predicted seats from the 44 it won in 2015. However Singh gave no hint of disappointment, dancing and high-fiving supporters after a triumphant speech, in which he said his party would continue to \u201cplay a constructive and positive role in the new parliament\u201d.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Donald Trump congratulated Trudeau for a \u201ca wonderful and hard fought victory\u201d, saying Canada was \u201cwell served\u201d by its leader. His congratulations came despite the leaders\u2019 rocky relationship. Trump described Trudeau as \u201cdishonest\u201d and \u201cweak\u201d at last year\u2019s disastrous G7 meeting in Quebec.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Other world leaders joined a chorus of congratulations for Trudeau, but Boris Johnson and Emmanuel Macron are yet to comment.<br><br></li> \n   <li>In an awkward moment in the early hours of Tuesday morning, barely a minute after Andrew Scheer started addressing supporters at the Conservative headquarters, Justin Trudeau took to the stage in Montreal to deliver his victory speech, in a highly unconventional moment of political scheduling, which a CTV news anchor suggested was evidence of a \u201cnasty campaign\u201d spilling over into election night.

He declared his party is \u201cthe government in waiting\u201d.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The Greens are expected to win three seats \u2013 up from one won in the 2015 election (though they gained another seat in a by-election earlier this year), and promised to \u201chold feet to the fire\u201d in the new parliament, especially to ensure action on the climate crisis.<br><br></li> \n   <li>The real winners in today\u2019s vote were the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, which are set to win 32 seats, more than tripling the party\u2019s seat count compared to the 2015 election, making it the largest party after the Liberals and Conservatives. The leader of Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet told supporters the desire for Quebec sovereignty ran deep within him but he did not go to parliament to undermine federalism, but would represent the interests of Quebecois in parliament \u201cwhile we wait for Quebecois to choose another path\u201d, where Quebecois might be \u201cpartners, but equals, and free\u201d.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The election represents a death knell for the country\u2019s fledging far right party, the People\u2019s Party of Canada, writes Martin Petriquin. \u201cIts leader, former Conservative MP Maxime Bernier, adopted the tone and substance of Trumpian nativism, decrying multiculturalism and promising to decrease immigration.

          "bodyText": "We\u2019re now going to close our live coverage of the Canadian election. Here is an updated version of the summary my colleague Kate Lyons posted earlier. Justin Trudeau won a second term as prime minister of Canada in a narrow victory that will mean he will lead a minority government. Its worth noting that minority governments in Canada do not usually last longer than two years. Trudeau\u2019s Liberal Party led in 146 out of 304 electoral districts that had reported results by about 10:30pm Toronto time on Monday, short of the 170 needed to security a majority government. The New Democratic Party were widely expected to support the Liberals in some way, but the nature of their future relationship in the Canadian parliament remains to be seen and there was speculation that the left-wing party would pull Trudeau in a more progressive direction. However, the party led by Jagmeet Singh suffered a blow on election day, dropping to 24 predicted seats from the 44 it won in 2015. However Singh gave no hint of disappointment, dancing and high-fiving supporters after a triumphant speech, in which he said his party would continue to \u201cplay a constructive and positive role in the new parliament\u201d. Donald Trump congratulated Trudeau for a \u201ca wonderful and hard fought victory\u201d, saying Canada was \u201cwell served\u201d by its leader. His congratulations came despite the leaders\u2019 rocky relationship. Trump described Trudeau as \u201cdishonest\u201d and \u201cweak\u201d at last year\u2019s disastrous G7 meeting in Quebec. Other world leaders joined a chorus of congratulations for Trudeau, but Boris Johnson and Emmanuel Macron are yet to comment. In an awkward moment in the early hours of Tuesday morning, barely a minute after Andrew Scheer started addressing supporters at the Conservative headquarters, Justin Trudeau took to the stage in Montreal to deliver his victory speech, in a highly unconventional moment of political scheduling, which a CTV news anchor suggested was evidence of a \u201cnasty campaign\u201d spilling over into election night. (see 7.29am) Addressing supporters, Trudeau said the nation had voted in favour of a \u201cprogressive agenda\u201d and committed his government to fighting for all Canadians, not just those who voted for him. The leader of the Conservative Party Andrew Scheer said while the night had not ended the way he wanted, the results \u2013 which saw the Liberals lose around 20 seats and the Conservatives win a larger share of the popular vote than the Liberals \u2013 showed his party had \u201cput Trudeau on notice\u201d. He declared his party is \u201cthe government in waiting\u201d. The Greens are expected to win three seats \u2013 up from one won in the 2015 election (though they gained another seat in a by-election earlier this year), and promised to \u201chold feet to the fire\u201d in the new parliament, especially to ensure action on the climate crisis. The real winners in today\u2019s vote were the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, which are set to win 32 seats, more than tripling the party\u2019s seat count compared to the 2015 election, making it the largest party after the Liberals and Conservatives. The leader of Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet told supporters the desire for Quebec sovereignty ran deep within him but he did not go to parliament to undermine federalism, but would represent the interests of Quebecois in parliament \u201cwhile we wait for Quebecois to choose another path\u201d, where Quebecois might be \u201cpartners, but equals, and free\u201d. The election represents a death knell for the country\u2019s fledging far right party, the People\u2019s Party of Canada, writes Martin Petriquin. \u201cIts leader, former Conservative MP Maxime Bernier, adopted the tone and substance of Trumpian nativism, decrying multiculturalism and promising to decrease immigration. Formed just over a year ago, the PPC ran a nearly full slate of candidates, yet failed to win a single seat.\u201d Jody Wilson-Raybould, the former attorney general and justice minister who was expelled from the Liberal party after publicly criticising Trudeau for his role in the SNC Lavalin scandal, was successful in her bid to retain her seat as an independent. Thanks for joining us, and have a nice day. The Liberal party has tweeted this photo of Justin Trudeau embracing supporters. While the Conservative party\u2019s Twitter account still leads on this campaign video. And the New Democratic Party is striking an optimistic note. Bloc Quebecois say thanks. This is worth a read. Congratulatory tweets from world leaders are coming thick and fast. Here is Martin Patriquin\u2019s snap analysis: This is from Reuters: A Quebec separatist party that softened its demands for independence reaped the reward on Monday, mounting a remarkable comeback in Canada\u2019s election that deprived Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of a majority. The Bloc Quebecois, revitalised under new leader Yves-Francois Blanchet, jumped to 32 seats from 10 seats in the predominantly French-speaking province, according to provisional results. Quebec accounts for 78 seats in the House of Commons, second only to Ontario. \u201cWe have come far but we will go further,\u201d Blanchet told jubilant supporters in the early hours of Tuesday. The ruling Liberals went into the election seeking to add 10 seats to the 40 they held in Quebec. But the Bloc\u2019s resurgence meant they lost seven, helping reduce Trudeau to a minority. Blanchet\u2019s party will not be a kingmaker in the new Parliament, however, since the Liberals look set to govern with the left-leaning New Democrats. Surveys show support for Quebec independence is far below the levels it hit in 1995, when a referendum on breaking away from Canada only just failed. Blanchet has muted talk of separatism, positioning the Bloc as a party that wants to stand up for Quebec\u2019s interests and the French language in the federal Parliament in Ottawa rather than actively seeking to break up the country. \u201cThe strength Blanchet brings is he projects an image that is not quite as hardcore as the previous leaders. That allows him to draw on a much wider slice of the electorate,\u201d said University of Montreal professor Pierre Martin. The 54-year-old former provincial minister and media personality said the Bloc wanted to make Parliament work and would back any proposed legislation that was good for Quebec. \u201cI don\u2019t believe Quebecers and Canadians elected a minority government with the goal of going back to the ballot boxes in 18 months,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to make Parliament work.\u201d Blanchet - repeating comments he made over the weekend - said Quebec could one day \u201cgive itself all the attributes of sovereignty,\u201d while making clear it would not happen during the lifetime of this federal Parliament. \u201cOur job is not to make Canadian federalism work. Our job ... is also not to cause problems,\u201d he said, adding the party would not be servile. Blanchet is particularly close to Quebec\u2019s nationalist Coalition Avenir Quebec government, which brought in legislation earlier this year banning some public employees from wearing religious symbols. Trudeau said during a French-language campaign debate that he would be prepared to challenge the law, prompting Blanchet to accuse him of not respecting Quebec. There is speculation that the Liberals is most likely to be supported by the left-wing New Democratic party. Singh has said he has spoken with Trudeau and told him his party would be \u201cworking hard to deliver on making sure we deliver the priorities that Canadians have.\u201d Minority governments in Canada rarely last more than two years. John Manley, a former Liberal finance minister who now works in the private sector, said: I think a Liberal government supported by the NDP is likely going to lean farther left. It raises a series of issues about what are the demands that an NDP party would make. What\u2019s the price of governing going to be? I think businesses are going to be reluctant to make any moves until they get some satisfaction around that. Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets, said: One question will be if the Liberals adopt any of the NDP proposals on raising taxes, or will the focus instead fall on pharmacare. It\u2019s likely that at least one key NDP priority will be addressed. Conrad Winn, professor of political science at Carleton university, said: He\u2019s (Trudeau) going to have to curry support with somebody. The NDP may not wish to run another election, they may not be able to afford it. The Bloc may very well wish to run another election because they\u2019re on a bit of a comeback. It\u2019s not clear what kind of deal that Justin has to have with the opposition parties. He may have to have a deal with more than one party. Jonathan Rose, professor in politics at Queen\u2019s university in Kingston, Ontario, said: Historically, the Liberals have been kind of a chameleon party. They\u2019ve campaigned from left and governed from the right. They\u2019ll moderate the way they govern for the next few years. Markets like stability and minority governments are inherently less stable than majority governments, but Justin Trudeau and the Liberals are a known commodity and so it shouldn\u2019t be disruptive. Right now they don\u2019t need the Bloc Quebecois. That\u2019s probably a relief for the Liberals. Karl Schamotta, director of global markets strategy at Cambridge Global Payments, said: The (results) suggest that Mr. Trudeau will require the support of leftist opposition parties to enact important pieces of legislation. The strongly environmentalist, anti-corporation and social spending-friendly New Democratic Party is likely to assume the king-maker role, meaning that investment-friendly pipeline and infrastructure initiatives could struggle to win approval. Here\u2019s the front page of the Globe and Mail, arguably the most influential newspaper in Canada. It notes the surge of Bloc Quebecois in the French-speaking province, after reports that it had downplayed its aspirations for independence in Quebec. Global National anchor Dawna Friesen said it was \u201cunprecedented\u201d that the prime minister would begin his speech during that of his main opponent\u2019s. Still, the channel moved to cover the leader of the largest party. Here\u2019s more from Andrew Scheer\u2019s speech. Its worth noting that the Conservatives usually do well in Alberta and Saskatchewan. There were excitable scenes during New Democratic Party leader Jasmeet Singh\u2019s speech earlier, after the loss of nearly half his party\u2019s seats. Here\u2019s a useful interactive map of of the results from CBC. That\u2019s it from me, my colleague Mattha Busby is going to take over the blog and bring you any late analysis and reaction. Thanks for reading along. Justin Trudeau has won a second term as prime minister of Canada, but in a narrow victory that will mean he leads a minority government.

The Greens are expected to win three seats \u2013 up from one won in the 2015 election (though they gained another seat in a byelection earlier this year), and promised to \u201chold feet to the fire\u201d in the new parliament, especially to ensure action on the climate crisis. The real winners in today\u2019s vote were the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, which are set to win 32 seats, more than tripling the party\u2019s seat count compared to the 2015 election, making it the largest party after the Liberals and Conservatives. The leader of Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet told supporters the desire for Quebec sovereignty ran deep within him but he did not go to parliament to undermine federalism, but would represent the interests of Quebecois in parliament \u201cwhile we wait for Quebecois to choose another path\u201d, where Quebecois might be \u201cpartners, but equals, and free\u201d. Jody Wilson-Raybould, the former attorney general and justice minister who was expelled from the Liberal party after publicly criticising Trudeau for his role in the SNC Lavalin scandal, was successful in her bid to retain her seat as an independent. Addressing her supporters, May says that along with the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois (which almost doubled its seat count), the Greens are the big winners today, having doubled their popular vote and tripling its seat count (the Greens won one seat in 2015, but picked up a second in a byelection a few months ago. They won three this today). \u201cWe will keep fighting across this country,\u201d she said. \u201cIn a minority government we can make a huge difference and we will.\u201d May spoke about the children\u2019s climate strikes and the need for aggressive action on climate change. \u201cWe will not allow the parliament of Canada in its 43rd session to let down the children of Canada.\u201d \u201cThis is the best result that any Green Party in any first-past-the-post parliamentary system has ever had,\u201d said May, who vowed that her party would work hard to hold the government to account by \u201cnon-stop arm-twisting\u201d. \u201cI guess the phrase is holding the feet to the fire, there will be crispy toes,\u201d she said. Scheer said he has spoken to Trudeau to congratulate him on winning the most seats. He said that the strength of a democracy is not just measured by how we vote, but how we move forward once those votes have been counted. Scheer said that while the night\u2019s results are not what he hoped for, he is proud of the team and the Conservative movement, reminding people of the different mood in 2015 \u201cwhen Justin Trudeau looked unstoppable, when pundits said that this was the beginning of another Trudeau dynasty and he had eight of 15 years ahead.\u201d But Scheer said this election result, in which the Liberals lost 20 seats, showed that the \u201cConservatives have put Trudeau on notice\u201d. \u201cMr Trudeau, when your government falls, Conservatives will be ready and we will win.\u201d Scheer says his party has made history by turning a first-term majority government into a minority government and highlights the fact that the Conservatives are leading the popular vote. \u201cMore Canadians wanted us to win this election than any other party!\u201d he said. \u201cThis is how it starts! We are the government in waiting.\u201d Trudeau has finished speaking. CTV\u2019s news anchor says: \u201cIt\u2019s very unorthodox for one leader to start talking while another leader is still talking.\u201d So, CTV is now screening Andrew Scheer\u2019s speech from where they had to cut it off in order to cross to Trudeau. Trudeau\u2019s speech can be seen here. Trudea addresses Canadians, saying that no matter who they voted for, he would be their prime minister. \u201cWe will work hard for you, your families and your family.\u201d Trudeau says that the nation has voted in favour of a progressive agenda. \u201cYou have asked us to invest in Canadians, to reconcile with the indigenous people and make it a priority and to show even more vision and ambition where we are fighting against the biggest challenge of our times \u2013 climate change. It is exactly what we will do, we know there is a lot of work to do, but I give you my word, we will continue what we started. \u201cLiberals know, as all Canadians know, it is always possible to do better.\u201d \u201cWe all want safer communities, a cleaner planet and a better quality of life. We seek hardship for none and prosperity for all, and if we unite around these common goals, I know we can achieve them. In the years ahead, our team will work hard to build on the progress \u201cWe will champion Canada in all its diversity,\u201d he says. \u201cWe will always put this country and its people first.\u201d Trudeau thanks supporters Trudeau begins by thanking his family including his wife, with whom he says he made a decision years ago \u201cto fight for a stronger Canada and a more prosperous Canada\u201d. Trudeau thanks is campaign staff who have made huge sacrifices \u201cto move Canada forward\u201d. He thanks them and says \u201cyou did it!\u201d Andrew Scheer is giving a speech to supporters, thanking them. But just as he has started his speech, Trudeau has taken to the stage, cutting into Scheer\u2019s speech, forcing news networks to cut from Scheer\u2019s speech to Trudeau, with news reporters on CTV saying \u201ca nasty campaign has bled into election night\u201d, suggesting the unusual timing of the speech was deliberate from Trudeau\u2019s campaign. Jagmeet Singh of the leftwing NDP is addressing supporters. He says it has been an incredible night and an incredible journey, despite the fact his party\u2019s 44 seats look set to be cut nearly in half (they are currently projected to win 25 seats). He congratulates Justin Trudeau, whom he said he had called earlier in the evening. He says he told Trudeau that the NDP would be working hard to deliver on the promises they had campaigned on. Singh says he was honoured to lead a team that was the \u201cmost diverse and most caring\u201d, which represented women and LGBTQ people. He spends a lot of time thanking his team and talking about the people he met throughout the campaign who inspired him to campaign for affordable healthcare and medication and the rights of indigenous Canadians. The speech started in English, before moving to French as he addressed supporters in Quebec. He said through the campaign he had met a lot of people in Canada who are doing it tough and his message to them was: \u201cNew Democrats are going to Ottawa to fight for you. \u201cThe real winner of this election is not a leader or a party, the real leader of any election should be the people and that is Canadians,\u201d he said. \u201cCanadians have sent a clear message tonight that they want a government that works for them, not the rich and powerful, not for the well-connected.\u201d As Leyland Cecco points out, despite the congratulatory message from Trump, the two leaders haven\u2019t had a warm relationship. The US president called the Canadian prime minister \u201cdishonest\u201d and \u201cweak\u201d last year, after Trudeau and and other world leaders issued a communique at the G7 hosted in Qu\u00e9bec. The two leaders had also feuded over trade policy, with Trump accusing Trudeau of placing \u201cmassive tariffs\u201d on consumer goods. Their chilly relationship stands in stark contrast to the \u201cbromance\u201d Trudeau had with former president Barack Obama, who endorsed the Liberal leader last week ahead of the vote. Leyland Cecco has this update: Jody Wilson-Raybould, the former attorney general and justice minister who was expelled from the Liberal party after publicly criticizing Trudeau for his role in the SNC Lavalin scandal, was successful in her bid to retain her seat as an independent.T he first Indigenous person to hold the one of the most powerful positions in government, Wilson-Raybould played a central role in one of the most damaging episodes in Trudeau\u2019s first term of office, when she testified the prime minister and his staff improperly pressured her to abandon the criminal persecution of engineering giant SNC Lavalin. After she resisted, she was shuffled out of the position of attorney general and eventually ejected from the party. Jane Philpott, the former treasury board president and close friend of Wilson-Raybould was also booted from the party for criticizing Trudeau. But her attempt as an independent candidate to keep her seat in Ontario failed, with a disappointing third place finish for the one-time star of the Liberal party. Green Party leader Elizabeth May has spoken to Global News. She says while the party doesn\u2019t want to count its chickens, it has been a good night for her party and they are hopeful they might take a seat in Fredericton, New Brunswick. She said she hoped the Greens might play a crucial role in the minority government that is formed. \u201cNone of the other parties have put forward a credible climate plan and we really don\u2019t have time for these wonderful lip-service messages about climate, we actually have to do what\u2019s required and I hope we have enough seats to get whatever government is formed to do what is required,\u201d she said. The leader of Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet is addressing supporters now. It has been a good day for his party, which is set to win 32 seats, more than tripling the party\u2019s seat count compared to the 2015 election, making it the largest party after the Liberals and Conservatives. He praises his fellow candidates, saying \u201cThree or four months ago when we were just crazy people, some crazy people said yes, and now some crazy people are going to the House of Commons.\u201d \u201cThose people set aside their professional life and they won with a solemn commitment to Quebecois.\u201d Speaking about the fact Canadians had elected a minority government, he said: \u201cNo party will control the House of Commons.\u201d \u201cThe Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois does not want to form a government or participate in a government. However, if what is proposed will help Quebec, you can count on us. But if it hurts Quebec, the bloc will stand up and block it.\u201d He said the party will talk with government about policies \u201cexcept if we\u2019re talking about putting more oil across Quebec,\u201d to huge cheers, or if it means compromising Quebec\u2019s language, values, and commitment to secular institutions. He added that he does not think that the people of Canada voted for a minority government because they want to go back to the polls in 18 months. Blanchet said the desire for Quebec sovereignty runs deep within him but he does not go to parliament to undermine federalism. Blanchet said that his party would not be servile but would aim to represent the interests of Quebecois \u201cwhile we wait for Quebecois to choose another path\u201d, where Quebecois might be \u201cpartners, but equals, and free\u201d. Australia\u2019s top election analyst has been tweeting about the results and as he points out, the Conservatives have actually received a higher share of the vote than the Liberals. The former is predicted to receive 34.4% of the overall vote, compared to 33.2% for the Conservatives. This is largely the result of much of their support being concentrated in areas like Alberta and Saskatchewan, where there are not a huge number of seats, or ridings, as they are called in Canada. Leyland Cecco reports on the upsets in tonight\u2019s results: Despite maintaining power, Trudeau has lost a number of cabinet ministers. The most stunning defeat was veteran lawmaker and public safety minister Ralph Goodale, who has represented Saskatchewan since 1993. In Alberta, both Amarjeet Sohi, the natural resource minister and Randy Boissonnault lost their seats, a result that means the neither Alberta nor Saskatchewan will have representation in Trudeau\u2019s federal government as frustration in the western region of the country continues to amplify. The Conservative party also took a heavy loss, with deputy party leader Lisa Raitt losing her race to former Olympic kayaker Adam van Koeverden. Maxime Bernier, leader of the populist People\u2019s Party of Canada, which critics have called xenophobic and racist, has lost his seat. Without Bernier\u2019s much-needed win, the former Conservative minister\u2019s newly-formed party will have no presence in the house of commons \u2013 making its future unclear. Greens leader Elizabeth May will hold on to her seat, giving the Greens two confirmed and two expected seats. Leyland Cecco writes: Without his majority, Trudeau will have to reach out to other parties in order to prop up his Liberal party\u2014 and how they will cobble together the 170 votes needed. Rather than create a formal coalition, the prime minister will likely use a process known as confidence and supply, in which the Liberals reach out to different parties in order to secure votes for legislation. The results open the door to the leftwing New Democratic Party and Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois to the balance of power a minority government. The star of the evening was Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet, leader of the separatist Bloc which managed to more than triple its seat count over the 2015 election. Jagmeet Singh of the leftwing NDP, who surged in the polls in the final weeks of the campaign with the aid of viral social media videos, wasn\u2019t able to convert the popularity into electoral wins. The party\u2019s 44 seats were nearly cut in half. The results tracker at the top of this blog shows the number of declared seats for each party, which confusingly seems to suggest that the Conservatives will win more seats that the Liberals, but below you\u2019ll also see the number of predicted seats for each party, which give Trudeau\u2019s Liberal a lead over Scheer\u2019s Conservatives. He may not become Canada\u2019s next prime minister, but Andew Scheer is set to retain his seat. Pretty grim scenes at the Conservative Party headquarters, as results come in predicting Trudeau will hold on to power, albeit probably in a minority government. Leyland Cecco has this interpretation of events: Justin Trudeau will hold on to power \u2013 but a number of tight races mean it is unclear how strong his mandate will be. With results still to come, the Liberal party have a large enough lead over the rival Conservative party to continue governing, but have not yet reached enough seats to preserve their parliamentary majority. With the prospects of a minority government, election results will prove critical in determining which parties hold the balance of power moving forward. Stewart Prest, from the department of political science at Simon Fraser University, sounds a note of caution after CBC predicted a Liberal minority government. Martin Patriquin who is at the Liberal Party headquarters in Montreal writes that cheers erupted as CBC and Radio-Canada just called a Justin Trudeau government. \u201cFour more years!\u201d chants the crowd\u2014though it is still unknown whether it is going to be a minority or a majority government. CBC have called the election for Trudeau, though have said \u201cwhether it will be a minority or majority government remains to be seen.\u201d Polls have now closed across the country. Leyland Cecco has our first results of the night.As of 10pm EST (now) the results are as follows: Number of seats the party has won or is leading in: Liberal 94 Conservatives 63 Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois 16 New Democratic party 9 Green 1 While the Liberals have lost a handful of seats in Atlantic Canada, the party has nonetheless emerged largely unscathed \u2013 a promising result for Trudeau. But as results from Ontario and Quebec begin to pour in, the race is expected to tighten considerably. The separatist Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois party is hoping to make substantial gains in Qu\u00e9bec, stealing back seats the Liberals won in 2015. In the suburbs of Ontario, Conservatives are hoping to make gains as well- but early results don\u2019t look promising for the party. Martin Patriquin is in Montreal at the Liberal party headquarters. He writes: There are maybe three dozen Liberal supporters at the party\u2019s campaign headquarters at Montreal\u2019s Palais des congr\u00e8s. With the polls in Quebec and Ontario just closed, they shuffle about what looks like a carpeted pit, watching the giant screen, periodically cheering as positive results trickle in and otherwise taking advantage of the cash bar. A note for those who don\u2019t speak fluent Canadian: the term \u201criding\u201d is going to be used a lot tonight. This is the way electoral districts are known in Canada, so we might say \u201cThe Green party have unexpectedly taken a seat in the riding of Fredericton\u201d. Leaders voting \u2013 in pictures They\u2019ve called the Green seat in Fredricton, New Brunswick. Jenica Atwin has defeated incumbent Matt DeCourcey, from the Liberal Party, who is currently placing third. It looks like the Green party could take a seat in Fredericton, New Brunswick, which would be pretty significant. They were not expected to win the seat, but currently have a strong lead there. Our reporter Leyland Cecco has this gudie for how the night is likely to unfold. As Canada votes, pollsters expect a tight race as Justin Trudeau looks to protect his parliamentary majority \u2013 and job as prime minister. The provinces in Atlantic Canada (Newfoundland &amp; Labrador, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island), which Trudeau swept in 2015, will provide the first glimpse into the Liberal leader\u2019s popularity. But all eyes will be on the vote-rich provinces of Quebec and Ontario, where Trudeau\u2019s fate could decided. Results from eastern Canada will available at 9:30 PM EST (in about half an hour). In the event that no clear front runner has emerged, party leaders will have to look west for an answer to who will form government. While Conservatives will likely sweep the Prairies (Alberta and Saskatchewan) \u2013 British Columbia is notoriously unpredictable and could play a deciding factor. Results from the province will come in at 10 PM EST (in about an hour). Hello and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the Canadian election. I\u2019ll be bringing you the news as it comes out. Our reporter Leyland Cecco is on the ground in Toronto, you can follow him on Twitter here. Justin Trudeau is bracing for the possibility of an electoral loss after Canadians went to the polls today in an election that marked a stunning change of fortunes for the charismatic Liberal leader who had pledged to reshape the country\u2019s politics. In the closing days of the campaign, Trudeau acknowledged that there was a good chance the opposition Conservatives could take more votes than his Liberal party, but the result is set to be close. Despite frantic campaigning that has seen the leaders criss-cross the country, no party appears set to capture the 170 seats needed for a majority in the House of Commons and smaller parties are fighting to emerge as powerbrokers. The election campaign has been marked by scandal, in particular the emergence of images showing Trudeau in blackface, while the Conservative leader, Andrew Scheer, was accused of concealing the fact that he also holds a US passport. Polls have closed on the east coast and we should be getting results from there shortly. Polls on the west coast will close in the next hour. It could be a long and fraught few days before a government is formed, as Leyland Cecco reports: \u201cIf early results don\u2019t indicate a clear winner, attention will likely shift to British Columbia, which Frank Graves, head of political polling firm Ekos Research Associates, calls a \u201cpollster\u2019s nightmare\u201d for its difficulty to predict, meaning election night will be long and tiring for all party leaders. The uncertainty also foreshadows what could be a protracted and bitter fight in the coming days for control of parliament, making the last forty days seem like a breeze.",

The prime minister will ask MPs to back him in two crucial votes \u2013 on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/21/what-does-boris-johnsons-withdrawal-bill-actually-say\">withdrawal agreement bill</a> (WAB), enshrining the deal he struck in Brussels last week, and on his plan to ram it through the House of Commons by the end of Thursday. Johnson has already been forced to send a letter to Brussels asking for an extension. But if the government can force its Brexit bill through parliament in time, the UK could in theory still leave the EU by Thursday of next week.</p> \n<p>With the backing of some Labour rebels and the Tories who supported Oliver Letwin\u2019s amendment at the weekend, Johnson is expected to win the vote on his bill known as the second reading, signalling MPs\u2019 approval for it to proceed in principle. But Downing Street is braced for potential defeat on the so-called \u201cprogramme motion\u201d setting out the timetable to get the bill through.

          "bodyText": "Top story: Bid to ram bill through parliament Good morning \u2013 Warren Murray on another day when too much news is barely enough. Boris Johnson will make a final bid today to force Brexit through by the 31 October \u201cdo or die\u201d deadline. The prime minister will ask MPs to back him in two crucial votes \u2013 on the withdrawal agreement bill (WAB), enshrining the deal he struck in Brussels last week, and on his plan to ram it through the House of Commons by the end of Thursday. Johnson has already been forced to send a letter to Brussels asking for an extension. But if the government can force its Brexit bill through parliament in time, the UK could in theory still leave the EU by Thursday of next week. With the backing of some Labour rebels and the Tories who supported Oliver Letwin\u2019s amendment at the weekend, Johnson is expected to win the vote on his bill known as the second reading, signalling MPs\u2019 approval for it to proceed in principle. But Downing Street is braced for potential defeat on the so-called \u201cprogramme motion\u201d setting out the timetable to get the bill through. If that motion falls, the government has little chance of \u201cgetting Brexit done\u201d, as Johnson puts it, by 31 October. And MPs from across the house are likely to table a string of amendments seeking to tweak the Brexit deal, including to force the government to negotiate a customs union with the EU27 and to subject it to a \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d. Johnson and key ministers have insisted they could not live with a customs union \u2013 if such an amendment passed, the PM would face the choice of accepting it or making a fresh bid for a general election. * * * Trudeau\u2019s minor triumph \u2013 Justin Trudeau has won a second term as Canada\u2019s prime minister after the country\u2019s federal election, but his narrow victory means he will lead a minority government that will be forced to depend on other parties to govern. At last count the Liberals were leading or victorious in 146 out of 304 electoral districts, having needed to win 170 seats to remain in majority government. The overall result laid bare the deep divisions in the country: not a single Liberal was elected in the western Prairie provinces, which the Conservatives swept. But overall it marked a clear defeat for the Conservative leader Andrew Scheer, whose campaign pledges to quash carbon pricing legislation and cut taxes failed to resonate with voters. * * * Climate risk to sea life \u2013 Ocean acidification caused by the climate crisis could lead to the mass extinction of marine life, fossil evidence shows. Scientists say it is a warning that humanity is risking potential \u201cecological collapse\u201d in the oceans. Carbon emissions from the burning of coal, oil and gas are absorbed by the ocean and make it more acidic. Researchers analysed seashells from sediment laid down after a giant meteorite hit the Earth 66m years ago, wiping out the dinosaurs and three-quarters of marine species. They found the pH dropped by 0.25 units or more in the centuries after the strike \u2013 acidic enough to dissolve the chalky shells of many species. Researchers estimate the pH of the ocean will drop by 0.4 units by the end of this century if carbon emissions are not stopped, or by 0.15 units if global temperature rise is limited to 2C. \u201cIf 0.25 was enough to precipitate a mass extinction, we should be worried,\u201d said Michael Henehan, from the GFZ German research centre for geosciences in Potsdam. * * * Party murder suspect held \u2013 A man aged 21 was arrested last night on suspicion of the targeted murders of two 17-year-old boys and the attempted murders of two other males at a house party in Milton Keynes on Saturday.

The attackers arrived at the house uninvited, armed and wearing face coverings. The 21-year-old suspect was not named by Thames Valley police and remains in custody. Police, including forensics officers, are expected to remain on the scene for days yet and have increased patrols in the local area. Formal identification of both victims and a Home Office postmortem examination are expected to take place today. * * * Troll campaigns shut down \u2013 Facebook says it has taken down four new foreign interference operations originating from Iran and Russia, including one targeting the US 2020 presidential election. One operation that appeared to emanate from the Internet Research Agency \u2013 the Russian troll outfit \u2013 adopted various political identities such as pro-Donald Trump, anti-police violence, pro-Bernie Sanders, LGBTQ, feminist, pro-police and pro-Confederate.

Launched in full last Wednesday, the 10-part series tells the true story of a group of young men who dug a tunnel from West Berlin to East Berlin in the early 1960s, under the Berlin Wall, and used it to smuggle people out. The Beeb had a big party for the podcast launch, which offered a live Q&amp;A with the podcast\u2019s presenter-producer, Helena Merriman, and one of the tunnellers, plus the chance to enjoy an \u201cimmersive experience\u201d. A short, non-muddy bit of tunnel-crawling, I imagine. I don\u2019t know; I didn\u2019t go.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t attend the party because I get a bit put off by Big BBC Podcast Launches. They load the poor podcast with such high expectations that, as a listener, you\u2019re almost bound to be disappointed. Think of all the fuss and flannel around <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/26/13-minutes-to-moon-kevin-pietersen-beast-man-where-this-service-will-review\" title=\"\">13 Minutes to the Moon</a></em> earlier this year: fuss that meant that the series, which was OK, but not brilliant, was a letdown. And what about <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p06hmv8c\" title=\"\">The Ratline</a></em>, the second series in the Radio 4 Intrigue podcast strand (<em>Tunnel 29</em> is the third)? That, like <em>13 Minutes</em>, was both massively hyped and badly produced, with weird editing decisions leading to a confusing narrative. <em>The Ratline</em> had the feel of too many executives poking over the script. It was a great story, let down by bad storytelling.</p> <p><em>Tunnel 29</em>, I\u2019m happy to say, is wildly better. This is mostly to do with Merriman, whose scriptwriting and delivery are sure-handed and clear, with nary a whiff of cheese. Not for her the BBC cliches of going on a journey, of unnecessary how-I-made-this-podcast detail, of awkward this-is-me-feeling-stuff chat, of foreshadowing and over-explanation.</p> <p>Instead, Merriman is confident. She tells the story, which is a good one, a real Le Carr\u00e9-style cold war yarn, in a positive manner, with proper forward motion. She\u2019s happy, as she says, to \u201cfreeze the action\u201d when needed, leaving one set of characters doing their thing, while visiting others in the story. She reminds us who is who; she explains without patronising. She leaves us wanting more; each episode is only as long as it needs to be (between 15 and 30 minutes).</p> <p>Merriman\u2019s clarity and detailed reporting is enhanced by some wonderful soundscaping by Eloise Whitmore. We hear muttered voices, clanking axes, the click of an old-fashioned gun. We sense the claustrophobia of the tunnel (Whitmore recorded in there). Music swells and retreats as needed; the end of each episode is played out by Tom Rosenthal\u2019s How This Came to Be, or, sometimes, Keep Me Warm. (Merriman researched and chose all the music herself.)</p> <p>The series itself is an engaging tale that shifts, around episodes six and seven, into something really thrilling. There are many unexpected elements to the tunnel escape \u2013 an American TV crew, a walkabout girlfriend \u2013 and the whole series is given real jeopardy by the presence of a Stasi mole and by the Stasi itself, the GDR security service so terrifyingly good at its job that its interrogation officers didn\u2019t need to use force. Congratulations to Merriman, who clearly kept all the meddlers well away: <em>Tunnel 29</em> is both a Big BBC Podcast and a really great listen. Don\u2019t believe the hype, just enjoy it for yourself.</p> <p>There\u2019s a lovely moment in <em>Tunnel 29</em> when an East German describes the first time he tastes pineapple marmalade; his lip-smacking delight reminded me of how lax I can be about reviewing food series. Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 I love food \u2013 I\u2019m just not quite into it enough to listen to programmes about it.</p> <p>But for those who are interested, I feel I should mention the World Service\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p028z2z0\" title=\"\">The Food Chain</a></strong>. It won best radio show this year at the US culinary awards, the <a href=\"https://www.jamesbeard.org/blog/the-2019-james-beard-media-award-winners\" title=\"\">James Beard Foundation awards</a>, and rightly. It tackles all sorts of food-related stories, such as cooking for celebrities (last week: very interesting), or suicide rates among farmers, or what people cook after a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w3csyp02\" title=\"\">bereavement</a> (the two episodes that won the James Beard award).

She\u2019s a fitness coach, an Adidas global ambassador and an entrepreneur; as you might guess, her podcast is a motivational one. She uses interviews with interesting people to unpick how you might change your life. This month, Herbert focuses on radio veteran Trevor Nelson, gal-dem\u2019s Liv Little, 1Xtra\u2019s Jamz Supernova and Dope Black Dads\u2019 Marvyn Harrison. Herbert\u2019s presenting style can be a little stiff, but she\u2019s a nice interviewer and these shows are, indeed, motivational.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.aboutracepodcast.com/1-things-can-only-get-better\" title=\"\">About Race with Reni Eddo-Lodge</a></strong><br>This is such a great podcast.

Clever, sympathetic and insightful, Eddo-Lodge tackles white people who try to be helpful, \u201cwhiteness\u201d in UK elections, why black people have to talk personally to be listened to, and so much more. Though this podcast series has been out for a while, it\u2019s still essential listening.</p>",

She\u2019s a fitness coach, an Adidas global ambassador and an entrepreneur; as you might guess, her podcast is a motivational one. She uses interviews with interesting people to unpick how you might change your life. This month, Herbert focuses on radio veteran Trevor Nelson, gal-dem\u2019s Liv Little, 1Xtra\u2019s Jamz Supernova and Dope Black Dads\u2019 Marvyn Harrison. Herbert\u2019s presenting style can be a little stiff, but she\u2019s a nice interviewer and these shows are, indeed, motivational. About Race with Reni Eddo-Lodge This is such a great podcast. Eddo-Lodge came second to George the Poet in last year\u2019s Best New Podcast awards, and despite George\u2019s brilliance it must have been a close contest. About Race covers history and contemporary life, using soundscapes, interviews, and music to give context. Clever, sympathetic and insightful, Eddo-Lodge tackles white people who try to be helpful, \u201cwhiteness\u201d in UK elections, why black people have to talk personally to be listened to, and so much more. Though this podcast series has been out for a while, it\u2019s still essential listening.",

His widely hyped tax hike on the richest 1% was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/03/justin-trudeau-phony-war-against-inequality\" title=\"\">actually a giveaway</a> to the next richest 10% of Canadians. His embrace of a carbon tax became a cover for frenzied approval of fossil fuel projects, culminating in his purchase of a C$4.5bn (US$3.45bn) tar sands pipeline. He dispatched heavily armed police to violently dismantle a peaceful blockade of Indigenous land defenders. He made Canada the <a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/canada-now-the-second-biggest-arms-exporter-to-middle-east-data-show/article30459788/\" title=\"\">second largest weapons dealer</a> to the Middle East, arming the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/13/canadian-government-lied-over-12bn-arms-sale-to-saudi-arabia\" title=\"\">Saudi war on Yemen</a>.

Beholden to powerful vested interests, Trudeau promised big but delivered small.</p> \n<p>And so the energy he rode to power has evaporated. Trudeaumania, as one analyst put it, has been replaced by Trudeau-meh-nia. Now that the shine has worn off the Liberals\u2019 formula of fake progressivism, we\u2019re being treated to the party\u2019s perennial fall-back: exhortations to back them \u201cstrategically\u201d, lest the Conservatives come to power. Trudeau\u2019s pledge to \u201cdo politics differently\u201d has devolved into straightforward moral blackmail.</p> \n<p>Of course, it\u2019s true that a government under Conservative leader Andrew Scheer would be a frightening ordeal: C$35bn (US$26.6bn) in <a href=\"https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/2019/10/11/conservative-plan-would-cut-354b-to-balance-books.html\" title=\"\">spending cuts</a>, tax giveaways to the wealthiest, climate change denialism, and a potential erosion of abortion and LGBTQ rights. But the Liberals\u2019 invocation of this rightwing threat is hardly in good faith. It\u2019s something they have done time and again to muzzle the political imagination of Canada\u2019s progressive majority of voters. Artificially shoring up the idea that the country is stuck between two parties has one main objective: scaring Canadians into settling for the pipeline-buying establishment Liberals.</p> \n<p>This fearmongering distracts from just how many economic policies Liberals share with Conservatives \u2013 corporate tax cuts, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/true-north/2016/nov/22/justin-trudeaus-giant-corporate-giveaway\" title=\"\">creeping privatisation</a>, attacks on worker\u2019s rights and relentless resource extraction on Indigenous peoples\u2019 lands. The two parties\u2019 implementation of this free market agenda has resulted in a wildly unequal social order: stagnating wages, unaffordable housing and skyrocketing corporate profits <a href=\"https://pressprogress.ca/corporate-canadas-pile-of-cash-in-offshore-tax-havens-has-hit-353-billion-for-the-first-time-in-history/\" title=\"\">stashed away</a> in offshore tax havens. It\u2019s no wonder that <a href=\"https://globalnews.ca/news/5860959/canadians-society-politics-ipsos-poll/\" title=\"\">67% of Canadians</a>, according to a poll last month, believe correctly that the \u201ceconomy is rigged to advantage the rich and powerful\u201d.</p> \n<p>The Liberals\u2019 inflated rhetoric against the Conservatives also disguises just how comfortable they are swapping power. They consistently propped up former Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper\u2019s minority government, though they could have toppled him by forming a coalition that included the social democratic New Democratic party (NDP). And when the NDP itself contended for office in the 2018 Ontario provincial election, the Liberals attacked it ferociously, enabling victory for the reactionary Conservative leader Doug Ford. Liberals have always been more afraid of a challenge from the left than the right.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"d9c7d9ef-0199-465c-a9fd-4e664cacfb09\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Nv6tdsbOPKg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p> But if Canadians want the kind of country that reflects their progressive views, the choice in this election is clear: vote for the NDP. The overlooked story of the election is the surge in the party\u2019s popularity, which has come at the expense of both the Liberals and Conservatives \u2013 and in spite of the media\u2019s efforts to write it off.</p> \n<p>Under the leadership of Jagmeet Singh, the NDP has finally halted its right-ward slide \u2013 which allowed Justin Trudeau to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/true-north/2015/oct/22/trudeaus-bold-change-pledge-was-a-ruse-but-canada-now-has-a-fighting-chance\" title=\"\">outflank</a> it to the left in 2015 \u2013 and is offering its <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/ndp-singh-health-policy-federal-election-1.5175899\" title=\"\">most progressive platform</a> in a generation. State-funded dental care and prescriptions, 300,000 green jobs and free public transit, paid for by a wealth tax on the ultra rich: the sort of the ambitious leftwing policies that polls consistently show Canadians are hungry for.</p> \n<p>In an age of turmoil, it is this kind of politics, rather than establishment Liberalism, that can hope to stem the tide of an increasingly xenophobic right. Pervasive insecurity and discontent in Canada, fundamentally unaddressed by Liberal policies, have been capitalised on by rightwing politicians to scapegoat migrants and Muslims \u2013 followed closely by openly white supremacist groups, whose numbers have <a href=\"https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/2019/03/06/researchers-to-probe-canadas-evolving-far-right-movements.html\" title=\"\">nearly tripled</a> since Trudeau came to office. This week\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/16/obama-justin-trudeau-canada-election\" title=\"\">endorsement</a> of Trudeau by Barack Obama underscores the dynamic: both are defenders of a bankrupt, corporate-friendly centrism that has demonstrated it is no match for rightwing faux populists such as Donald Trump. This is what gives the ultimate lie to the promise of \u201cstrategic voting\u201d. The politics of the Liberals aren\u2019t a lesser evil \u2013 they are the surest path to greater evil.</p> \n<p>The only answer to a rising right will come from a left courageous enough to take on vested interests, rather than the vulnerable \u2013 and to redistribute obscene levels of private wealth in the service of the public good. The NDP is not going to win this election. But if Canadians elected enough of its MPs, a minority Liberal government might be forced to rely on the party to pass legislation: this would provide powerful leverage in parliament to push for vital new social programs and a transformative approach to the climate crisis, with social movements pressuring from the outside. Universal healthcare, public pensions, the 40-hour work week, same-sex marriage: all were won under previous minority Liberal governments when the NDP held the balance of power.</p> \n<p>But for that to become possible after Monday, it will take voting from hope, not fear. In this election, Justin Trudeau isn\u2019t Canada\u2019s real progressive choice \u2013 nor the politician to stop the rise of an ugly right.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Martin Lukacs is a journalist and author of The Trudeau Formula: Seduction and Betrayal in an Age of Discontent</p>",

Of course, it\u2019s true that a government under Conservative leader Andrew Scheer would be a frightening ordeal: C$35bn (US$26.6bn) in spending cuts, tax giveaways to the wealthiest, climate change denialism, and a potential erosion of abortion and LGBTQ rights. But the Liberals\u2019 invocation of this rightwing threat is hardly in good faith. It\u2019s something they have done time and again to muzzle the political imagination of Canada\u2019s progressive majority of voters. Artificially shoring up the idea that the country is stuck between two parties has one main objective: scaring Canadians into settling for the pipeline-buying establishment Liberals. This fearmongering distracts from just how many economic policies Liberals share with Conservatives \u2013 corporate tax cuts, creeping privatisation, attacks on worker\u2019s rights and relentless resource extraction on Indigenous peoples\u2019 lands. The two parties\u2019 implementation of this free market agenda has resulted in a wildly unequal social order: stagnating wages, unaffordable housing and skyrocketing corporate profits stashed away in offshore tax havens. It\u2019s no wonder that 67% of Canadians, according to a poll last month, believe correctly that the \u201ceconomy is rigged to advantage the rich and powerful\u201d. The Liberals\u2019 inflated rhetoric against the Conservatives also disguises just how comfortable they are swapping power. They consistently propped up former Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper\u2019s minority government, though they could have toppled him by forming a coalition that included the social democratic New Democratic party (NDP). And when the NDP itself contended for office in the 2018 Ontario provincial election, the Liberals attacked it ferociously, enabling victory for the reactionary Conservative leader Doug Ford. Liberals have always been more afraid of a challenge from the left than the right. But if Canadians want the kind of country that reflects their progressive views, the choice in this election is clear: vote for the NDP. The overlooked story of the election is the surge in the party\u2019s popularity, which has come at the expense of both the Liberals and Conservatives \u2013 and in spite of the media\u2019s efforts to write it off. Under the leadership of Jagmeet Singh, the NDP has finally halted its right-ward slide \u2013 which allowed Justin Trudeau to outflank it to the left in 2015 \u2013 and is offering its most progressive platform in a generation. State-funded dental care and prescriptions, 300,000 green jobs and free public transit, paid for by a wealth tax on the ultra rich: the sort of the ambitious leftwing policies that polls consistently show Canadians are hungry for. In an age of turmoil, it is this kind of politics, rather than establishment Liberalism, that can hope to stem the tide of an increasingly xenophobic right. Pervasive insecurity and discontent in Canada, fundamentally unaddressed by Liberal policies, have been capitalised on by rightwing politicians to scapegoat migrants and Muslims \u2013 followed closely by openly white supremacist groups, whose numbers have nearly tripled since Trudeau came to office. This week\u2019s endorsement of Trudeau by Barack Obama underscores the dynamic: both are defenders of a bankrupt, corporate-friendly centrism that has demonstrated it is no match for rightwing faux populists such as Donald Trump. This is what gives the ultimate lie to the promise of \u201cstrategic voting\u201d. The politics of the Liberals aren\u2019t a lesser evil \u2013 they are the surest path to greater evil. The only answer to a rising right will come from a left courageous enough to take on vested interests, rather than the vulnerable \u2013 and to redistribute obscene levels of private wealth in the service of the public good. The NDP is not going to win this election. But if Canadians elected enough of its MPs, a minority Liberal government might be forced to rely on the party to pass legislation: this would provide powerful leverage in parliament to push for vital new social programs and a transformative approach to the climate crisis, with social movements pressuring from the outside. Universal healthcare, public pensions, the 40-hour work week, same-sex marriage: all were won under previous minority Liberal governments when the NDP held the balance of power. But for that to become possible after Monday, it will take voting from hope, not fear. In this election, Justin Trudeau isn\u2019t Canada\u2019s real progressive choice \u2013 nor the politician to stop the rise of an ugly right. \u2022 Martin Lukacs is a journalist and author of The Trudeau Formula: Seduction and Betrayal in an Age of Discontent",

          "bodyText": "In an election defined by mudslinging and racist dog-whistling, Justin Trudeau stood apart. In a country weary of nearly a decade of Conservative rule, Canada\u2019s Liberal leader was a sunny optimist promising change. And his refusal to play dirty politics \u2013 in contrast to the veteran politicians he was facing off against \u2013 inspired young voters to come out in record numbers. \u201cWe were looking for a leader that would be our person,\u201d said Aisha Pedican, a Toronto-based film-maker who was in her mid-20s the last time Canada went to the polls. \u201cI just remember thinking, \u2018Oh, this guy has a younger voice, I can relate to this.\u2019\u201d Pedican recalls an electricity surrounding Trudeau\u2019s 2015 candidacy; he was a proudly progressive candidate who promised to fight climate change, repair a broken relationship with Indigenous people, resettle Syrian refugees \u2013 and do politics differently. But four years later, the excitement surrounding the prime minister has matured into frustration and apathy. Ahead of Canada\u2019s general election on Monday, Trudeau has been robbed of the many tools he effectively deployed in his last campaign. As the incumbent prime minister, he\u2019s no longer the underdog promising to shake up Canada for the better, nor is he even the youngest party leader. And the stunning rise of Jagmeet Singh, leader of the New Democratic party, threatens to steal away young voters at a time when Trudeau needs them most. Trudeau\u2019s progressive shine is looking tarnished and shop-worn, and \u2013 despite a surprise last-minute endorsement from Barack Obama \u2013 the prime minister is now in the fight of his political life. Polling shows Trudeau essentially tied with his Conservative rival, Andrew Scheer. Despite spending weeks criss-crossing the country to pitch their vision of the country, neither party has successfully swayed voters. Facing the prospect of losing his parliamentary majority, the prime minister has been forced into attack mode, trading barbs with both Scheer and Singh. But the strategy \u2013 a far cry from his previous \u201csunny ways\u201d campaign \u2013 could alienate the young voters, warned Shachi Kurl, executive director at the polling firm Angus Reid. If Trudeau hopes to emerge victorious on 21 October, he desperately needs to excite millennials, such as Pedican, who came out in record numbers for the prime minister in 2015. \u201cNegative campaigns can have the effect of increasing cynicism \u2013 and can have the effect of suppressing voter turnout,\u201d said Kurl, who argued that Trudeau\u2019s previous optimism had clouded over in an election defined by personal attacks and an absence of any bold policy discussions. \u201cMost devastatingly, [Trudeau] has failed to live up to his own standards around ethics and around doing politics differently,\u201d said Kurl \u2013 a reference to both the recent blackface scandal and a damning ethics commissioner report which found Trudeau had broken the law when he tried to prevent a large engineering company from facing criminal prosecution. Complicating the picture for Trudeau is Singh, who has run an unflinchingly optimistic campaign, often in the face of overtly racist incidents. The first person of color to lead a federal party, Singh\u2019s early candidacy was marred by a series of stumbles, including the exodus of several senior lawmakers from the party. But after successful debate performances, he has surged in the polls and achieved something which now seems out of reach for Trudeau: inspiring young voters with the prospect of change. At a recent campaign visit in Toronto, Singh posed for photos as he danced his way through the crowd to an impromptu stage. \u201cTogether, we can build a brighter future. We\u2019re not stuck with choosing between bad or worse. We\u2019re not stuck having to settle for less,\u201d he said to cheers. \u201cAsk your friends, ask your neighbour, ask your family to dream big. Because you deserve it.\u201d Meanwhile, Trudeau has been forced to swap his lofty rhetoric of 2015 for centrist pleas to voters \u2013 disheartening those who supported his first bid. \u201cA lot of us really saw him as like a different kind of politician and then ended up being very disappointed \u2013 almost lied to by \u2013 how he turned out\u201d said Rayne Fisher-Quann, a youth activist in Vancouver who, at 18, will be voting in her first federal election. \u201cHe seems very performative, especially when you look at the huge discrepancies between his words and his actions.\u201d She points to a string of disappointments: Trudeau\u2019s nationalisation of the controversial TransMountain pipeline to ensure its construction despite opposition from environmentalists and some First Nations groups; his decision to boot out two high-profile women from his caucus; and his failure to meaningfully improve the country\u2019s the fraught relationship with Indigenous peoples. These unfulfilled promises, she said, made it feel as though Trudeau was \u201cputting on a show of being progressive\u201d for younger voters. In the final days of the campaign, the prime minister has relied heavily on the slogan \u201cChoose Forward\u201d, warning that a vote for anyone but his party clears a path for a Conservative government. For voters like Pedican, the strategy has resonated. \u201cI get that change is slow and takes time,\u201d she said. \u201c[Trudeau\u2019s] not the ideal candidate. But I would prefer to see him in office than Andrew Scheer.\u201d If, as predicted, neither the Liberals or the Conservatives win enough votes to command a majority of the House of Commons, all parties \u2013 including the Greens and the separatist Bloc Quebecois \u2013 could emerge as kingmakers in post-electoral negotiations. While pollsters caution that a split on the left could open a path for the Conservatives to emerge victorious, the idea of voting strategically is often anathema to a generation that rejects the status quo of politics. And for those unwilling to forgive the prime minister for broken campaign promises, Singh and the New Democrats \u2013 who could wield immense power in a minority government situation \u2013 are seen as an attractive alternative. \u201cRight now a lot of people \u2013 especially young people \u2013 don\u2019t have a whole lot of hope,\u201d said Fisher-Quann. \u201cIt\u2019s always very heartening to see when a candidate is able to tap into hope \u2013 and make people feel like their voices can matter.\u201d",

          "bodyText": "Robyn Moser still remembers the bidding wars for mansions when Calgary\u2019s oil economy roared. In her best years \u2013 the decade before a 2014 crash in petroleum prices \u2013 Moser would sell more than 75 luxury homes, including estates with spectacular views of the Rocky Mountains. Last year she sold just 40 properties \u2013 and all at reduced prices. \u201cWhen people list their home, what we say is: what\u2019s your hurt price?\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then we need to go lower from there.\u201d Canadians go to the polls on 21 October in a federal election still considered too close to call. A CBC poll tracker shows the opposition Conservatives holding a slim lead over the ruling Liberals \u2013 though neither is projected to win a majority government. But the same poll tracker projects a Tory landslide in Alberta, where the Conservatives hold a nearly 45-point lead over Justin Trudeau\u2019s Liberals. Albertans have long been wary of the Trudeau name \u2013 Justin\u2019s father Pierre forced the province to sell petroleum at a discount to the rest of Canada \u2013 but they did give the younger Trudeau the benefit of the doubt in 2015. In the last federal election, the Liberals took four of the province\u2019s 34 seats. But even then, the provincial economy was starting to slow down. The drop in oil and gas prices the previous year sent unemployment soaring to north of 10%. The local economy has stayed sluggish ever since \u2013 and many Albertans hold the prime minister responsible, accusing him of showing indifference to their plight and pandering to other parts of the country. \u201cI think the federal government has a specific hate on\u201d for Alberta, Moser said. \u201cWe have a federal government that wants to choke the Alberta economy for its own political reasons.\u201d Meanwhile, the province\u2019s oil sands \u2013 some of the largest petroleum deposits in the world \u2013 have come under attack from environmentalists who argue that extraction of the carbon-heavy fuel is incompatible with fighting climate change Trudeau has tried to play both sides of the climate issue. He promises to make Canada a climate leader and marched in recent climate protests. But his government has also purchased the Trans Mountain pipeline, to ensure the completion of a project to carry Alberta oil to the west coast despite intense opposition from Indigenous groups and the government of neighbouring British Columbia. Little of that impresses Albertans, who complain that the Trans Mountain project remains in limbo and and point to a pair of recently approved bills increasing environmental controls on megaprojects and banning tanker traffic off the west coast. Trudeau\u2019s stated ambition to \u201cphase out\u201d the oil sands and transition away from fossil fuels has reinforced the antipathy. \u201cIf he had said, \u2018I wish we could phase out the auto sector faster because of the emissions it creates\u2019 and then put forward two bills to essentially make that happen \u2026 the entire country would have been lit on fire on,\u201d said the Conservative MP Michelle Rempel Garner, who represents a Calgary electoral district. The economic downturn is especially dramatic in Calgary\u2019s downtown, where the vacancy rate in office towers still tops 20%. Total income in Alberta crashed by 20% between 2014 and 2016, while 130,000 jobs were lost in a province of 4.3 million, according to Trevor Tombe, an economist at the University of Calgary. In the boom years, Alberta\u2019s prosperity attracted workers from across Canada and high school dropouts earned C$100,000 in boomtowns such as the oil sands hub Fort McMurray. Lloyd George moved to Alberta from Nova Scotia in 2001 with little more than ambition and two suitcases. Nearly 20 years later, he runs an oil supply company, providing specialty pipes for petroleum projects. He\u2019s staying profitable, he says, though business would be \u201cdouble or triple\u201d with a better economy \u2013 and more pipelines. \u201cIt\u2019s been four years of kicking someone while they\u2019re down,\u201d he said of the Trudeau government\u2019s treatment. \u201cWe\u2019re in an abusive relationship and we can\u2019t leave because there\u2019s nowhere else to go.\u201d Long the malcontents of the Canadian confederation, Albertans complain the province\u2019s oil bounty is spread to other provinces through equalisation payments. Trudeau\u2019s home province has been the largest recipient of such payments \u2013 a fact not lost on Albertans, who note that Quebec opposes pipelines, even as tankers transport oil down the St Lawrence River. Amid the perceptions of antipathy from the federal government, some in the province have even revived the idea of separating from Canada. \u201cI\u2019d support it,\u201d George said. \u201cBut I\u2019ll hate it every step of the way.\u201d Elsewhere in Canada, the environment has emerged as a key issue for voters, but in Alberta \u2013 a region whose economy depends on fossil fuels, voters seem indifferent to the climate crisis, despite the wildfires that tore through Fort McMurray in 2016, and record floods which inundated Calgary in 2013. The disasters \u201chad little impact on public sentiment\u201d, said Keith Brownsey, professor at Mount Royal University in Calgary. \u201cDependence on oil and natural gas has led to a focus on the economy,\u201d he said. \u201cClimate change is a secondary issue here.\u201d",

          "body": "<p>The year 2019 might still have some surprises in store for us \u2013 Donald Trump is yet to ask the Queen if she has any dirt on Joe Biden \u2013 but we know the general shape of it: global chaos, lies and Love Island. We also know many of its words. We are approaching the moment when the great dictionaries pick those that sum up our times, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/nov/15/toxic-oxford-dictionaries-word-of-2018\" title=\"\">following on from last year\u2019s \u201ctoxic\u201d</a> (Oxford English Dictionary), \u201cjustice\u201d (Merriam Webster) \u201csingle use\u201d (Collins) and \u201cme too\u201d (Macquarie). The words might not have been coined in 2019, but will have acquired new meaning, risen to prominence, or somehow distil our preoccupations. In advance of the lexicographers\u2019 big reveal, here are my top 10 candidates.</p> \n<h2><strong>People</strong></h2> \n<p>A pretty ordinary word \u2013 and one with a long history (its origins are murky once you get past Latin, where populus meant a community or nation). But the way the idea of \u201cthe people\u201d has been used over the past year, often cynically, makes it thoroughly contemporary. Supporters of Brexit constantly invoke the \u201cwill\u201d of the people, likening the nation to an individual with desires and motives. Their opponents agitate for a \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d. Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1179179573541511176?lang=en\" title=\"\">makes it</a> a proper noun: \u201cI am coming to the conclusion that what is taking place is not an impeachment, it is a COUP, intended to take away the Power of the People.\u201d Back in Britain we nervously await a \u201cpeople versus parliament\u201d election, with Boris Johnson eager to paint MPs who oppose his strategy as anti-democrats at odds with the popular mood.</p> \n<h2><strong>Prorogue</strong></h2> \n<p>Like one of the aged vellum documents stowed in parliament\u2019s <a href=\"https://londonist.com/london/history/the-victoria-tower\" title=\"\">Victoria tower</a>, this word was unfurled in August to widespread incomprehension. But it is an important part of the creaking apparatus of the British constitution and refers to the act of ending a parliamentary session. It comes from the Latin verb to extend and contains the element rogare (to ask). As it turned out, there wasn\u2019t much asking involved \u2013 Johnson\u2019s government, in the vampiric form of Jacob Rees-Mogg, told the Queen that parliament needed to be suspended and she complied. But, as the supreme court concluded, this instruction was unlawful. As MPs re-entered the chamber on 25 September, the only trace of the prorogation was the imprint of its lugubrious syllables in our minds.</p> \n<h2><strong>Femtech</strong></h2> \n<p>Startup culture hasn\u2019t always seemed like the most <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/04/why-is-silicon-valley-so-awful-to-women/517788/\" title=\"\">welcoming </a>place for women, so the idea of femtech might seem like a breath of fresh air. Investment in digital technology designed to improve women\u2019s health and wellbeing \u2013 like Bluetooth enabled pelvic-floor training<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jun/02/pelvic-floor-bladder-urinary-leakage-incontinence-women-bluetooth-elvie\" title=\"\"> devices</a> or fertility apps \u2013 has been steadily building. In the first quarter of 2019, $241m (\u00a3190m) was ploughed into femtech companies, leading some to predict the sector\u2019s first <a href=\"https://consent.yahoo.com/collectConsent?brandType=nonEu&amp;.done=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2019%2F04%2F03%2Ffemtechs-billion-dollar-year%2F%3Fguccounter%3D1&amp;sessionId=3_cc-session_c8c06e99-3244-4f53-94e8-00d104a2efbe&amp;lang=&amp;inline=false\" title=\"\">billion-dollar year</a>. But the term isn\u2019t without controversy. \u201cWhen it\u2019s about men and men\u2019s health, it\u2019s not mentech, right?\u201d one analyst recently <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-49880017\" title=\"\">told</a> the BBC. \u201cWelcome to the world of 21st-century technological advancements, where brand new innovations give us the chance to \u2026 create exactly the same stupid sexist divides all over again,\u201d <a href=\"https://qz.com/1586815/why-femtech-is-a-sexist-category/\" title=\"\">wrote</a> Quartz\u2019s Olivia Goldhill. It\u2019s a good question: why are products aimed at half the population deemed niche?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b15463e5-19ff-4660-87d6-dab6896c1144\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PzKIGXRGgPc?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Sadfishing</strong></h2> \n<p>One of those rare words whose origin can be precisely pinpointed to an <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2019/01/21/sadfishing-social-media-trend-making-misery-profitabl-8367931/\">opinion piece</a> \u2013 in Metro in January. \u201cSadfishing,\u201d wrote Rebecca Reid, \u201cis when someone uses their emotional problems to hook an audience on the internet\u201d. She was attacking an Instagram post by Kris Jenner that teased followers with the promise of a confession by her daughter Kendall about some personal trauma: in fact, it was a marketing campaign for a skincare range. Sadfishing roared back into the news in September after a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-49883030\" title=\"\">report</a> commissioned by British headteachers suggested children who posted about their problems on social media were having the word thrown at them by bullies. It takes its place next to a series of terms relating to online behaviour that uses the suffix \u201cfishing\u201d, including <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-46427180\" title=\"\">blackfishing</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-39078201\" title=\"\">catfishing.</a></p> \n<h2><strong>Opioid</strong></h2> \n<p>Synthetic molecules that mimic the effects of natural opiates \u2013 chemicals derived from the opium poppy \u2013 are called opioids and they include now-familiar names such as oxycodone and fentanyl. They can be 100 times stronger than morphine and have rarely been out of the news in 2019 because of an explosion in the number of people killed by them, particularly in the US. Fatal overdoses now occur at a <a href=\"https://www.drugabuse.gov/drugs-abuse/opioids/opioid-overdose-crisis\" title=\"\">rate</a> of 130 a day, making the \u201copioid crisis\u201d or \u201copioid epidemic\u201d America\u2019s great contemporary public health crisis. It has also led to the fall of one of its richest families \u2013 the Sacklers, whose company Purdue Pharma produced OxyContin. Use of the search term \u201copioid\u201d <a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=opioid\" title=\"\">spiked</a> in August, when Purdue <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/purdue-pharma-offers-10-12-billion-settle-opioid-claims-n1046526\" title=\"\">agreed</a> to settle lawsuits against it to the tune of $10-$12bn.</p> \n<h2><strong>Pronoun</strong></h2> \n<p>Previously an innocuous piece of linguistic plumbing, the pronoun \u2013 a grammatical device used to refer back to a noun you have already mentioned \u2013 is having a moment. The word itself has become a signifier of the new gender politics: it is now not unusual to see the note \u201cpronouns: he/him\u201d or \u201cshe/her\u201d alongside job title and address at the end of emails or on social media profiles. In September, the singer Sam Smith told their Instagram followers \u201cMy pronouns are they/them\u201d, adding: \u201cAfter a lifetime of being at war with my gender, I\u2019ve decided to embrace myself for who I am, inside and out.\u201d The use of \u201cthey\u201d to refer to a singular noun, although it has a long history, has traditionally been discouraged by grammarians. The most recent edition of the famed Chicago Manual of Style, however, says: \u201cWhen referring specifically to a person who does not identify with a gender-specific pronoun ... they and its forms are often preferred.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>Woke</strong></h2> \n<p>Woke, meaning \u201cwell-informed\u201d, <a href=\"https://public.oed.com/appeals/woke/\" title=\"\">first appeared</a> in print in a glossary of \u201cwords you might hear in Harlem\u201d in 1962. It finally entered the Oxford English Dictionary in 2017, with the definition \u201calert to racial or social discrimination and injustice\u201d. So what makes it a potential word of the year 2019? Put simply, woke has gone mainstream and in doing so has been subject to a bizarre transformation. At the end of 2018, African American broadcaster <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/12/30/680899262/opinion-its-time-to-put-woke-to-sleep?t=1569314402606&amp;t=1570784464119\" title=\"\">Sam Sanders</a> made a plea \u201cto put woke to sleep\u201d. He argued that any authenticity it once had was being lost due to overuse by white liberals, leading to its co-option by businesses keen to burnish their progressive credentials \u2013 so-called \u201cwokewashing\u201d \u2013 and ultimately to a backlash. A new ironic use of woke has exploded and two books published this year exemplify the boomerang effect: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/mar/10/titania-mcgrath-woke-is-no-joke\" title=\"\">Woke by comedian Andrew Doyle</a>, writing as the PC parody Titania McGrath and Anti-Woke by professional contrarian Brendan O\u2019Neill. Woke is dead; \u201cwoke\u201d is alive and kicking.</p> \n<h2><strong>Nanoinfluencer</strong></h2> \n<p>Over the past few years a new economy has sprung up, its workers \u201crelatable\u201d personalities who are ostensibly letting you peek into their private lives, its products whatever they pose with on Instagram. It has proved fertile ground for new words, including \u201cinfluencer\u201d for the people involved and \u201csponcon\u201d, for sponsored content they post (a label seen more frequently since watchdogs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/16/social-media-stars-face-crackdown-over-money-from-brands\" title=\"\">cracked down</a> on stealth ads in 2017). Subcategories of influencer have been delineated: the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2019/08/meet-the-unfluencers.html\" title=\"\">unfluencer</a>\u201d, the \u201c<a href=\"https://dictionaryblog.cambridge.org/2019/06/10/new-words-10-june-2019/\" title=\"\">outfluencer</a>\u201d the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/barrettwissman/2018/03/02/micro-influencers-the-marketing-force-of-the-future/#5e5bb0f86707\" title=\"\">microinfluencer</a>\u201d. The latest is <a href=\"https://medium.com/swlh/nano-influencers-who-they-are-and-why-they-matter-c4278cc95d8f\" title=\"\">nanoinfluencer</a> \u2013 someone who may have only a thousand or so followers. They are supposed to be like you and me (and their endorsements come cheap for the brands that target them). As the digital economy penetrates deeper, some people you know might already fall into this category: maybe next year, you will too.</p> \n<h2><strong>Cancelled</strong></h2> \n<p>The fear that most preoccupies modern-day public figures is that of cancellation: being dumped in the basket of deplorables after a trial by a jury of millions of strangers.

          "bodyText": "The year 2019 might still have some surprises in store for us \u2013 Donald Trump is yet to ask the Queen if she has any dirt on Joe Biden \u2013 but we know the general shape of it: global chaos, lies and Love Island. We also know many of its words. We are approaching the moment when the great dictionaries pick those that sum up our times, following on from last year\u2019s \u201ctoxic\u201d (Oxford English Dictionary), \u201cjustice\u201d (Merriam Webster) \u201csingle use\u201d (Collins) and \u201cme too\u201d (Macquarie). The words might not have been coined in 2019, but will have acquired new meaning, risen to prominence, or somehow distil our preoccupations. In advance of the lexicographers\u2019 big reveal, here are my top 10 candidates. People A pretty ordinary word \u2013 and one with a long history (its origins are murky once you get past Latin, where populus meant a community or nation). But the way the idea of \u201cthe people\u201d has been used over the past year, often cynically, makes it thoroughly contemporary. Supporters of Brexit constantly invoke the \u201cwill\u201d of the people, likening the nation to an individual with desires and motives. Their opponents agitate for a \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d. Trump makes it a proper noun: \u201cI am coming to the conclusion that what is taking place is not an impeachment, it is a COUP, intended to take away the Power of the People.\u201d Back in Britain we nervously await a \u201cpeople versus parliament\u201d election, with Boris Johnson eager to paint MPs who oppose his strategy as anti-democrats at odds with the popular mood. Prorogue Like one of the aged vellum documents stowed in parliament\u2019s Victoria tower, this word was unfurled in August to widespread incomprehension. But it is an important part of the creaking apparatus of the British constitution and refers to the act of ending a parliamentary session. It comes from the Latin verb to extend and contains the element rogare (to ask). As it turned out, there wasn\u2019t much asking involved \u2013 Johnson\u2019s government, in the vampiric form of Jacob Rees-Mogg, told the Queen that parliament needed to be suspended and she complied. But, as the supreme court concluded, this instruction was unlawful. As MPs re-entered the chamber on 25 September, the only trace of the prorogation was the imprint of its lugubrious syllables in our minds. Femtech Startup culture hasn\u2019t always seemed like the most welcoming place for women, so the idea of femtech might seem like a breath of fresh air. Investment in digital technology designed to improve women\u2019s health and wellbeing \u2013 like Bluetooth enabled pelvic-floor training devices or fertility apps \u2013 has been steadily building. In the first quarter of 2019, $241m (\u00a3190m) was ploughed into femtech companies, leading some to predict the sector\u2019s first billion-dollar year. But the term isn\u2019t without controversy. \u201cWhen it\u2019s about men and men\u2019s health, it\u2019s not mentech, right?\u201d one analyst recently told the BBC. \u201cWelcome to the world of 21st-century technological advancements, where brand new innovations give us the chance to \u2026 create exactly the same stupid sexist divides all over again,\u201d wrote Quartz\u2019s Olivia Goldhill. It\u2019s a good question: why are products aimed at half the population deemed niche? Sadfishing One of those rare words whose origin can be precisely pinpointed to an opinion piece \u2013 in Metro in January. \u201cSadfishing,\u201d wrote Rebecca Reid, \u201cis when someone uses their emotional problems to hook an audience on the internet\u201d. She was attacking an Instagram post by Kris Jenner that teased followers with the promise of a confession by her daughter Kendall about some personal trauma: in fact, it was a marketing campaign for a skincare range. Sadfishing roared back into the news in September after a report commissioned by British headteachers suggested children who posted about their problems on social media were having the word thrown at them by bullies. It takes its place next to a series of terms relating to online behaviour that uses the suffix \u201cfishing\u201d, including blackfishing and catfishing. Opioid Synthetic molecules that mimic the effects of natural opiates \u2013 chemicals derived from the opium poppy \u2013 are called opioids and they include now-familiar names such as oxycodone and fentanyl. They can be 100 times stronger than morphine and have rarely been out of the news in 2019 because of an explosion in the number of people killed by them, particularly in the US. Fatal overdoses now occur at a rate of 130 a day, making the \u201copioid crisis\u201d or \u201copioid epidemic\u201d America\u2019s great contemporary public health crisis. It has also led to the fall of one of its richest families \u2013 the Sacklers, whose company Purdue Pharma produced OxyContin. Use of the search term \u201copioid\u201d spiked in August, when Purdue agreed to settle lawsuits against it to the tune of $10-$12bn. Pronoun Previously an innocuous piece of linguistic plumbing, the pronoun \u2013 a grammatical device used to refer back to a noun you have already mentioned \u2013 is having a moment. The word itself has become a signifier of the new gender politics: it is now not unusual to see the note \u201cpronouns: he/him\u201d or \u201cshe/her\u201d alongside job title and address at the end of emails or on social media profiles. In September, the singer Sam Smith told their Instagram followers \u201cMy pronouns are they/them\u201d, adding: \u201cAfter a lifetime of being at war with my gender, I\u2019ve decided to embrace myself for who I am, inside and out.\u201d The use of \u201cthey\u201d to refer to a singular noun, although it has a long history, has traditionally been discouraged by grammarians. The most recent edition of the famed Chicago Manual of Style, however, says: \u201cWhen referring specifically to a person who does not identify with a gender-specific pronoun ... they and its forms are often preferred.\u201d Woke Woke, meaning \u201cwell-informed\u201d, first appeared in print in a glossary of \u201cwords you might hear in Harlem\u201d in 1962. It finally entered the Oxford English Dictionary in 2017, with the definition \u201calert to racial or social discrimination and injustice\u201d. So what makes it a potential word of the year 2019? Put simply, woke has gone mainstream and in doing so has been subject to a bizarre transformation. At the end of 2018, African American broadcaster Sam Sanders made a plea \u201cto put woke to sleep\u201d. He argued that any authenticity it once had was being lost due to overuse by white liberals, leading to its co-option by businesses keen to burnish their progressive credentials \u2013 so-called \u201cwokewashing\u201d \u2013 and ultimately to a backlash. A new ironic use of woke has exploded and two books published this year exemplify the boomerang effect: Woke by comedian Andrew Doyle, writing as the PC parody Titania McGrath and Anti-Woke by professional contrarian Brendan O\u2019Neill. Woke is dead; \u201cwoke\u201d is alive and kicking. Nanoinfluencer Over the past few years a new economy has sprung up, its workers \u201crelatable\u201d personalities who are ostensibly letting you peek into their private lives, its products whatever they pose with on Instagram. It has proved fertile ground for new words, including \u201cinfluencer\u201d for the people involved and \u201csponcon\u201d, for sponsored content they post (a label seen more frequently since watchdogs cracked down on stealth ads in 2017). Subcategories of influencer have been delineated: the \u201cunfluencer\u201d, the \u201coutfluencer\u201d the \u201cmicroinfluencer\u201d. The latest is nanoinfluencer \u2013 someone who may have only a thousand or so followers. They are supposed to be like you and me (and their endorsements come cheap for the brands that target them). As the digital economy penetrates deeper, some people you know might already fall into this category: maybe next year, you will too. Cancelled The fear that most preoccupies modern-day public figures is that of cancellation: being dumped in the basket of deplorables after a trial by a jury of millions of strangers. Notable cancellees this year included the beauty YouTuber James Charles, whose followers turned against him for reasons too arcane for most outsiders to understand, and Justin Trudeau, whose offences in blackface are a bit easier to discern. Redemption can only be achieved through (ideally multiple rounds of) rehab, as satirised by Lolly Adefope in this year\u2019s BBC comedy short Sorry, in which an imperious actress on the brink of superstardom is felled by a 12-year-old tweet. If you are concerned about your own status, a new website, Am I Cancelled?, uses an algorithm to determine whether you are still fit to show your face on social media. Crisis Every age has predicted that the end of the world is nigh. But it increasingly feels as though inhabitants of early-21st century Earth may be on to something. From the environmental to the political and the economic, our times are defined by a worsening of conditions to the point of emergency. This year Britain and the US\u2019s serial constitutional crises have dominated the news, but a far bigger catastrophe, the climate crisis, has begun to seem more and more real, too. In May, the Guardian changed the language it uses to describe the situation, preferring climate crisis or breakdown to the less-urgent seeming climate change. In some of its earliest-recorded uses, the word referred to a \u201cturning point in a disease, that change which indicates recovery or death\u201d. It remains to be seen what course our own crisis will take. David Shariatmadari is the author of Don\u2019t Believe a Word: The Surprising Truth About Language",

Promising to slash income tax, cut fuel prices and repeal carbon pricing, Doug Ford took 41% of the vote and ended 15 years of Liberal rule in Ontario. In the weeks after his win, Conservative leaders flocked to his side, bathing in reflected electoral glory \u2013 and speculating that similar tactics might take them to victory over Justin Trudeau. But as the federal election draws near, Canada\u2019s Conservatives have adopted a very different tactic: avoiding Ford at all costs. In less than a year, Ford\u2019s stock as an electoral asset has plummeted: the Conservative leader, Andrew Scheer, hasn\u2019t appeared at a single campaign event with the premier, even when canvassing in Ford\u2019s own neighbourhood. Meanwhile, the Conservatives have struggled to build momentum outside their base. Scheer has failed to draw crowds to his campaign events, and has been forced to defend past remarks on same-sex marriage and abortion. And even after the prime minister became entangled in two scandals \u2013 ethics violations and images showing him in racist blackface, polls show Scheer and Trudeau locked in a dead heat. Conservative strategists worry that Scheer has failed to galvanize voters \u2013 and that Ford has become so toxic that he is hampering the party\u2019s chances of forming a government. As recently as late spring, Conservatives were basking in poll numbers that put them comfortably ahead of Trudeau\u2019s party. And in Ontario \u2013 where the Conservatives were overturning the legacy of an unpopular Liberal provincial government \u2013 the federal party was confident they had a strong ally. Ford was a relatively new face to mainstream conservative politics: his early political career was overshadowed by his younger brother Rob, the notorious former Toronto mayor who admitted smoking crack while in office. Despite several years as a city councillor, the elder Ford only entered provincial politics after his brother\u2019s death, and his candidacy was initially viewed with skepticism. But his blunt language and appeal to \u201cthe common folk\u201d soon drew comparisons with Donald Trump. And after he became premier of Ontario, Ford was quickly elevated to celebrity status within conservative circles, often appearing with Scheer at party events. \u201cI\u2019m putting the prime minister on notice,\u201d Ford told a cheering crowd last year. \u201cJustin Trudeau, you\u2019re next.\u201d In recent months, however, Ford has experienced a stunning reversal of fortune. His government has been dogged by protests over steep cuts to education, patronage scandals and looming labour strikes. Ford has also gone to war with the federal government over a carbon tax, spending millions on a legal fight the majority of Ontario residents oppose. His approval rating has dropped to 25%, making him the second-most disliked premier in the country. \u201cHe came in really wanting to quickly undo a lot of the signature policies of the previous government,\u201d said Omar Yan Khan, a political strategist in Toronto. \u201c[Ford\u2019s government] have been getting quite a bit of blowback from some of those decisions and it\u2019s led to a little bit of buyer\u2019s remorse on the part of many in the Ontario electorate.\u201d A recent poll from the Angus Reid Institute found that 85% of Ontario says the \u201cpolicies and actions\u201d of Ford\u2019s government would make them less likely to vote for Scheer\u2019s Conservatives in the federal election \u2013 and 71% suggested it would direct them towards the Liberals. Because of Ontario\u2019s electoral weight, it is virtually impossible for a party to win a general election in Canada without success in the province. Conservatives have traditionally done well in the region\u2019s rural areas, but the 21 October election is likely to hinge on the ethnically diverse suburbs of Toronto, a suburban sprawl known as the 905 (for its dialing code). 905 voters can be fickle: they granted the Conservatives a majority in 2011 \u2013 only to snatch it back in 2015, when Trudeau swept the province. Earlier this year, the Conservatives held a 10-point lead over the Liberals in Ontario \u2013 but that has now become a 10-point deficit, driven largely by Ford\u2019s unpopularity, said Frank Graves, head of polling firm Ekos Research. \u201cThat\u2019s an enormous transfer of seats from one side of the ledger to the other,\u201d he said. The cold math of parliament suggests Scheer, who has no viable allies on the right, needs to win an outright majority to have any hope of forming a government. Anything short of this allows Trudeau to strike deals with left-of-centre parties to stay in power. \u201cOntario is now turning into something of a political proxy war,\u201d said Shachi Kurl, executive director at Angus Reid. \u201cAnd Scheer is dealing with the Ford factor, which is a drag on the Conservative\u2019s political fortunes.\u201d Before Trudeau swept to power in 2015, the Conservatives governed Canada for nearly a decade and they retain immense support in rural areas and the western heartlands of the country\u2019s oil industry. But in an election taking place amid a climate emergency and rising income inequality, the party\u2019s pledge to quash carbon pricing legislation and cut taxes have not resonated with voters. Meanwhile, Scheer, who narrowly won control of the party in 2017, has struggled to carve out a distinct identity, lacking the charisma \u2013 and name recognition of Trudeau.

          "bodyText": "On a crowded stage where debate often devolved into a cacophony of crosstalk, Canada\u2019s federal leaders \u2013 including a fringe far-right candidate \u2013 have sought to sway voters before the country\u2019s election. Over two hours, federal political leaders lobbed the majority of their attacks at the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, in the only official English language debate before 21 October. Held in Gatineau, Quebec, the event marked the first time leaders from all six parties \u2013 Liberal, Conservative, New Democratic, Green, Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois and People\u2019s party \u2013 have appeared on stage together. \u201cThe choice tonight is between two parties that have very different views on climate change,\u201d said Trudeau, making his pitch for a second majority government, and positioning his re-election campaign around the looming climate crisis. \u201cPlease God you don\u2019t get a majority this time around,\u201d Green party leader Elizabeth May told Trudeau, arguing the Liberal plan was not ambitious enough. The wildcard coming into the evening was Maxime Bernier, leader of the far-right populist party the People\u2019s party of Canada. Formed amid a feud between Bernier and the Conservative party, its platform is defined by restrictive immigration politics and climate change denial. Activist groups had protested against his presence on stage, arguing it was wrong to give his policies a highly visible platform. But the Leaders\u2019 Debates Commission found Bernier \u2013 once a foreign minister under the Conservatives \u2013 had a \u201clegitimate chance\u201d of electing more than one candidate in the election. Throughout the evening he played the spoiler, frequently interrupting each candidate as they spoke.\u201cI think, within a few minutes tonight, Canadians can see why I didn\u2019t think you had a place on this stage,\u201d Jagmeet Singh, leader of the New Democratic party, told Bernier. Despite the number of candidates on stage, only two have emerged as clear frontrunners: Trudeau and the Conservative leader, Andrew Scheer. Polling suggests that while Trudeau\u2019s Liberal party has an edge in seat projections, after weeks of campaigning the prime minister and Scheer are tied in popular opinion. Scheer used the opening moments of the debate to attack Trudeau for wearing blackface, reviving a scandal that damaged the prime minister\u2019s progressive image. Scheer also accused the prime minister of wearing a \u201cmask\u201d when it comes to his feminist credentials and attempts at reconciliation with indigenous peoples. \u201cMr Trudeau, you are a phoney and you\u2019re a fraud and you do not deserve to govern this country,\u201d said Scheer in his opening remarks. Trudeau repeatedly attacked Scheer on perceptions of credibility, accusing the Conservative leader of dishonesty and obfuscation on taxes and abortion. Despite running a largely gaffe-free campaign, Scheer was put on the defensive last week after the Globe and Mail reported he held dual citizenship with the United States. Scheer\u2019s troubles were exacerbated given his history \u2013 as well as his party\u2019s \u2013 of criticising elected representatives who are dual nationals, including the former governor general Micha\u00eblle Jean. Singh, the first non-white leader of a major political party in the country\u2019s history, worked to cast himself as a third option for Canadian voters, accusing both Conservatives and Liberals of kowtowing to affluent donors and corporate interests. \u201cYou vote New Democrats, we\u2019re going to make sure we\u2019re going to make these things happen because we don\u2019t work for the powerful and wealthy,\u201d said Singh. \u201cWe work for you.\u201d In a debate that often became confusing with its numerous formats and moderators, Singh scored moments of levity.

Shared widely on anti-Trudeau Facebook pages earlier this year, the clumsy montage was presented as evidence that Canada\u2019s 23rd prime minister is bent on subverting the judicial system to please Islamists \u2013 probably because he is a closeted Muslim himself. Trudeau was pilloried when images emerged of at least three instances in which he had donned blackface. Yet as Canada heads toward a general election, the prime minister has also become the subject of racist and Islamophobic conspiracy theories. And unlike the 2016 US election \u2013 in which a significant portion of online misinformation was created on Russian troll farms \u2013 much of the anti-Muslim propaganda aimed at Trudeau is produced and disseminated by Canadians. The video of the YouTube imam, for example, was uploaded by a prominent Ontario anti-Muslim activist, and then viewed, shared and liked on at least three anti-Trudeau Facebook pages with a collective reach exceeding 185,000. Dozens of videos on these pages are a conspiratorial pastiche in which Trudeau coddles Muslim extremists and throws open Canada\u2019s borders at the behest of George Soros. And they have been clicked almost 700,000 times. The eddies of such online outrage sometimes spread into the real world. At a town hall meeting in January, an audience member accused Trudeau of supporting Sharia law \u2013 before intimating that he should be hanged for treason. More recently, the Conservative party candidate Cameron Ogilvie stepped down after the activist group Press Progress unearthed social media posts in which Ogilvie shared a post accusing Trudeau of wanting to turn Canada into an \u201cIslamic state\u201d. Such conspiracies date back to Trudeau\u2019s 2015 campaign pledge to bring in 25,000 mostly Muslim refugees from war-torn Syria by the end of the year. The move was a dramatic reversal from the previous Conservative government, which only agreed to increase the number of Syrian refugees admitted into Canada, from 1,300 to 10,000, provided Syria\u2019s non-Muslim religious and ethnic minorities were prioritized. Soon after, the anti-Trudeau conspiracies began in earnest, echoing US \u201cbirthers\u201d who alleged Barack Obama was ineligible for office or was secretly a Muslim. By early 2016, a Toronto-based Facebook group was already speculating that Trudeau wanted to flood Canada\u2019s borders with immigrants from majority Muslim countries, either because he was ignorant to the dangers of radical Islam \u2013 or because he was a radical Islamist himself. \u201cThe best non-confidence statement,\u201d one site member opined, would be for Trudeau to be shot. Neither the conspiracy-mongering nor the threats have hampered the site\u2019s popularity. In 2016, it had 25,000 followers. Today it has nearly 235,000. The conspiracies only heightened when the Liberals introduced a non-binding motion condemning \u201cIslamophobia and all forms of systemic racism and religious discrimination\u201d \u2013 a move which Trudeau\u2019s opponents on the fringe right were convinced was proof of his government\u2019s fealty to radical Islam. Liberal MP Iqra Khalid, the motion\u2019s sponsor, was inundated with hate mail and death threats. Meanwhile, Canada\u2019s statistical agency, found that police-reported hate crime targeting Muslims increased by 151% in 2017. Now Muslim groups found themselves in a unique situation: criticizing both Trudeau for donning brownface, as well as his enemies on the far right who say he is secretly Muslim. \u201cIt was disheartening to see the prime minister engage in blackface/brownface,\u201d said Mustafa Farooq, Executive Director of the National Council of Canadian Muslims. \u201cThat said, mislabelling someone as Muslim to castigate them is despicable.

One poll,found 41% of Canadians believe there are too many immigrants in the country \u2013 and more than 60% of self-described Conservatives say there are too many visible minorities here. Many of the far right\u2019s most prominent provocateurs are Canadians, including Faith Goldy, Stefan Molyneux and Lauren Southern \u2013 who was banned from Facebook earlier this year. A 2018 report by the country\u2019s intelligence agency found that Canadians who hold extreme rightwing views \u2013 including Islamophobia, anti-immigration and white nationalism \u2013 actively use chat forums and social media. \u201cThese individuals leverage online chats and forums in attempt to create an online culture of fear, hatred and mistrust by exploiting real or imagined concerns,\u201d the report found. \u201cWe strongly expect much of this kind of content to be domestic,\u201d said Taylor Owen, director of the Digital Democracy Project, which is monitoring instances of mis- and disinformation ahead of the election. \u201cAs in the EU parliamentary elections, domestic groups saw the tools and tactics which worked for Russia in the US election and simply co-opted them.\u201d All of this has kept fact-checkers busy. The CBC, the country\u2019s public broadcaster, has devoted seven journalists to fact check stories, ads, posts and other media that could have an impact on the election. Earlier this year, the Agence France-Presse news agency debunked a widely circulated story which said the Trudeau government had \u201cpleaded\u201d the Nigerian government to send one million immigrants to Canada. (The same site had Trudeau making similar requests of six other countries.) Yet the tide of anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant rhetoric persists, seemingly spurring the nativist impulses of some mainstream Canadian politicians. In Quebec, Canada\u2019s second-most populous province, the government led by the populist Coalition Avenir Qu\u00e9bec has reduced the number of incoming immigrants by 20%, despite the province\u2019s aging population and corresponding labour shortage. The CAQ also passed a \u201claicity\u201d law banning religious symbols from the bodies of certain government workers, which many see as disproportionately affecting Muslim women in the workplace. Last fall, the former Conservative MP Maxime Bernier launched a populist party that will field a full slate of candidates in the upcoming election. Bernier regularly berates Trudeau\u2019s \u201ccult of diversity\u201d, wants to \u201cmake Canada great again\u201d and shares videos from advocates of the baseless \u201cQAnon\u201d conspiracy theory that Donald Trump is battling a global cabal of elite liberal paedophiles. Bernier recently made the evidence-free claim that Islamic extremists have infiltrated Canadian politics, a contention pushed by one of the largest anti-Trudeau sites in the country. In less than a year, his thinly concealed dog-whistling has attracted notorious white nationalists and Canada\u2019s alt-right movement \u2013 as well as 5% of Canadian voters, according to one poll.",

Yet again, Boris Johnson swears blind he\u2019s going to withdraw on schedule. A promise an unspecified number of single mothers have heard before.</p> <p>Unfortunately, this conference contained adult themes from the outset. Welcome to the errordome, where by day three it had been established that a table seating plan constitutes sexual consent; where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/01/police-called-tory-conference-mp-geoffrey-clifton-brown\" title=\"\">the 1922 Committee treasurer had been sent home for an altercation with security staff</a> right before the home secretary\u2019s speech on law and order; and where Dominic Cummings was still apparating in unexpected places wearing the same grey tracksuit. He\u2019s not so much an eminence grise as a tracksuit grise. Cummings now edits at least three of this country\u2019s newspapers, and had to leave the conference bar to escape all the young Tory dudes who wanted selfies with him. You\u2019ve heard of crisis-of-masculinity podcasts? You live in one.</p> <p>Instead of \u201cGet Brexit done\u201d, the Tories should really have co-opted the deathless title of that Succession episode <a href=\"https://tv.avclub.com/succession-invites-us-into-the-war-room-in-its-overwhel-1836321593\" title=\"\">Shit Show at the Fuck Factory</a>. Those words would have been a way more appropriate backdrop to the spectacle of various <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/30/boris-johnson-groping-a-womans-thigh-i-can-believe-that\" title=\"\">cabinet ministers squirming over whether the PM groping the upper inner thigh of a woman would be one of their personal red lines</a>. Pressed on the Charlotte Edwardes claims, Matt Hancock blathered that he did have red lines that would force his cabinet resignation, but he wasn\u2019t going to say them out loud. Oh, Matt. Is one of them \u201c<a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/culture/andy-king-fyre-festival-meme-netflix-blowjob-king-world-112190\" title=\"\">blowing a customs official to secure the release of the Fyre festival\u2019s Evian water</a>\u201d? Because, you know \u2026 convince me you wouldn\u2019t. Hancock went on to imply that unwanted touching of women was OK because Johnson has \u201cnever lectured other people on their private lives\u201d. Yup, shit show at the fuck factory.</p> <p>Still, here he comes, Sex Wonka, raising hopes and denying gropes. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ODN/status/1178962307302481921\" title=\"\">Boris Johnson\u2019s most amusing viral moment</a> from Manchester featured one aide passing him a cup, only for another aide to snatch it back with the hissed words: \u201cNo. Disposable. Cups.\u201d I suppose it\u2019s very remotely possible this is something to do with \u201cthe environment\u201d, though the cup didn\u2019t even get a single use. But surely the more likely theory is that the prime minister never uses a hairbrush or drinks out of disposable cups because he daren\u2019t risk a DNA test.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3ca79c83536cae52e70327436bc0ff6211d75a9f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ca79c83536cae52e70327436bc0ff6211d75a9f/0_228_4848_2909/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tracksuit grise \u2026 Dominic Cummings.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tracksuit grise \u2026 Dominic Cummings.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Veysey/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of the No 10 aides in question was Rob Oxley, a chap whose other eyecatching move at the conference was to enter the press room on Sunday evening with an imperious: \u201cOne from each, one from each.\u201d Once one reporter from each paper had been martialled, Oxley told them the Edwardes allegations were untrue. No questions permitted. Had he been under the dinner table in question at the time? Inquiring minds want to know.</p> <p>Britain is now basically governed by a Jeremy Kyle villain who knows the ancient Greek for humbug. Boris Johnson\u2019s own foreword to the conference programme declared that he felt, in Manchester, \u201cthe same throb of possibility every time I visit\u201d. As you\u2019d expect from someone whose personal philosophy is \u201cno throb unyielded to\u201d. Beyond the security cordon in the real country \u2013 all those wonderful people out there in the dark \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/04/election-polls-boris-johnson-jeremy-corbyn\" title=\"\">Johnson\u2019s latest polling puts him on a minus 18 approval rating</a>. He\u2019s as popular as ebola on a chemo ward \u2013 and yet, he is still 42 (FORTY-TWO) points ahead of Jeremy Corbyn.</p> <p>Having not seen a policy since three Christmases ago, the Tories now hallucinate five before breakfast. To kick off conference, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/sep/29/from-40-hospitals-to-six-tories-nhs-numbers-dont-add-up\" title=\"\">Johnson announced he would be building 40 new hospitals</a>. (With what? Playmobil? Wine crates? We didn\u2019t hear; the figure later seems to have been commuted to six.) Andrew Bridgen literally proposed a monorail. Also being promised was limitless cheap nuclear energy within 20 years. This really is fully automated luxury WTFery. I\u2019m amazed they didn\u2019t float mining the asteroid belt. Maybe during the election.</p> <p>And so to the programme of events. Given where we are with Brexit, never has the usual portentous timetable looked more absurd. You could attend endless panels with titles such as \u201cAI: Could we? Should we?\u201d or \u201cThe future of capitalism\u201d. JUST TELL US WHAT\u2019S GOING TO HAPPEN IN FOUR WEEKS, YOU MAD BASTARDS. Johnson and Cummings\u2019 commitment to a no-spoilers Brexit is so total that they haven\u2019t even told Jacob Rees-Mogg or Arlene Foster their plan. But don\u2019t worry. As John Redwood put it: \u201cIt will work because we\u2019ve got some technology.\u201d</p> <p>But what technology? The Conservatives couldn\u2019t even update their conference app. Throughout the four days, it still showed a welter of what we might call ghost ship events, such as a big Q&amp;A with Rory Stewart, who was not in Manchester on account of not being in the Conservative party any more. Guys, you know if it\u2019s digital, you can update it at any time, yes? Maybe it\u2019s because the prime minister thinks \u201ctechnology lessons\u201d involve dancing poles. So they did try to change the app, but thought the way you did that was by twirling seductively into an inverted splits hold, while tossing your hair to Donna Summer\u2019s She Works Hard for the Money.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b70863be172f209ccff53232692875ba22b98e78\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b70863be172f209ccff53232692875ba22b98e78/0_528_4912_2947/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Feeling the strain \u2026 Johnson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Feeling the strain \u2026 Johnson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You could learn a lot from freeze-framing the conference at exactly the same point a year apart. On the Tuesday morning last year, prime minister Theresa May was asked in a radio interview about the manner in which Boris Johnson had stolen all her conference headlines. She replied: \u201cI\u2019m concentrating on what is important, which is getting a good deal for the UK.\u201d On the Tuesday morning this year, prime minister Boris Johnson was asked in a radio interview about Edwardes\u2019 headline account of his grope. He replied: \u201cI think what the public want to hear is about what we are doing to level up and unite the country.\u201d I wonder where we\u2019ll be in 2020. Maybe cabinet minister Nigel Farage will deflect from the emergence of his financial ties to the Russian government\u2019s covert sex robot building programme with the words: \u201cI am focused on what people want, which is delivering our domestic agenda.\u201d</p> <p>Like all his other urges, the PM can\u2019t suppress his irritation at even being asked about such things. How can this still be happening to him, now he is king of the gods? I do feel Johnson has been historically hampered by his inability to conduct assignations with mortal women by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leda_and_the_Swan\" title=\"\">disguising himself as a swan</a>, say, or <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana%C3%AB\" title=\"\">a shower of gold</a>. He has only ever taken the form of Boris Johnson. That said, there is an enchanting picture of Jennifer Arcuri \u2013 the grant-receiving model/tech entrepreneur in whose pole-dancing-equipped flat Johnson is reported to have had afternoon technology lessons \u2013 in which <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarinaHyde/status/1179289978951671808\" title=\"\">Arcuri is shown looming over a London mayor-themed cake</a>. In an image that might be captioned Attack of the 50 Foot Infosec Woman, Jennifer is gleefully biting the head of one of three fondant Boris Johnsons to adorn it. Did Zeus ever appear as an icing figurine? I must look it up before Priti Patel announces a book-burning initiative.</p> <p>In general, the hall reaction to speakers was muted. This is a revenue-gathering sort of gathering. In recent years, the dwindling band of elderly activists has been gradually replaced by an army of lobbyists for one form of Big Shittery or another. Even cabinet emoji Liz Truss could barely raise a laugh, while Patel should slap a whole life tariff on Northern Powerhouse minister Jake Berry for the following: \u201cThe only homes we are not going to build in the north of England is Sherlock Holmes!\u201d Jake, you can\u2019t even build a joke. It feels incredibly unlikely that you\u2019re going to be up to renewing the north.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d158009aa120397114c137de8368652cc3734653\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d158009aa120397114c137de8368652cc3734653/0_327_5644_3387/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Priti Patel.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Priti Patel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even Johnson didn\u2019t really do the business, and they missed yet another trick not making his entrance music Shaggy\u2019s It Wasn\u2019t Me. Declaiming welcome lies about having cleared up Britain\u2019s debt, and eyebrow-raisers like \u201cthe cocaine habits of the bourgeoisie\u201d, the prime minister looks like a man who answered a casting call searching for \u201ca Gary Busey type\u201d. He still dresses like someone who was last night banished to sleep in the car. Having said that, what was once a careless affectation increasingly begins to look essential. Not having a stylish uniform is one of the crucial bulwarks between Boris Johnson and a number of unfortunate historical #inspo<strong> </strong>associations.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just the use of terms like \u201csurrender act\u201d, which have to be said 437 times every day. This was a conference at which you could also repeatedly hear that parliament was illegitimate, the Benn Act was constitutionally illegitimate, and that the government could and should, in the words of one Brexiter, \u201csubvert it by any means necessary\u201d.</p> <p>On the fringe, panel composition tended toward the Sartrean. One completely packed event by the Bruges Group, held at Manchester\u2019s Comedy Store \u2013 leave it, it\u2019s not worth it \u2013 featured John Redwood, Mark Francois and Arlene Foster. All killers, no fillers. I\u2019m kidding, of course. There was actually a fourth panellist, in the form of a Brexit QC. But the main draw was Francois, who now gets the sort of reception you might expect Galatasaray fans to give Sergio Ramos if he signed for them. \u201cI\u2019ve got a feeling one or two of you might have heard Mark Francois speak before,\u201d trilled the chair, who went on to say that Mark \u201chas used his experience in the territorial army and his MA in war studies to great effect\u201d. A reminder that the definition of politics as the art of the possible is no substitute for wriggling through Epping Forest on your tummy dreaming of Rommel every second weekend.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c900572921219c5ac26987a826de3ae05224c6fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c900572921219c5ac26987a826de3ae05224c6fa/0_72_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Getting territorial \u2026 Mark Francois.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Getting territorial \u2026 Mark Francois.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Henry Nicholls/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In fact, put like that it\u2019s incredible that we STILL haven\u2019t Brexited, until you remember that Mark has voted a full three times, and at every time of asking, not to leave the EU. Once he\u2019d announced his forthcoming book - it will be called You Couldn\u2019t Make It Up, a title previously used by both Jeremy Kyle and Richard Littlejohn \u2013 Mark\u2019s Bruges Group headline appearance concluded with a stark warning to parliamentarians. \u201cAsk not for whom the bell tolls,\u201d ran this thundering salvo. \u201cIt tolls for them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s amazing, isn\u2019t he?\u201d sighed the woman in the row behind me. I would estimate that at the Bruges Group, a scientific 83% of the women in the audience own cooking aprons printed with the torso of a French maid, would regard Boris Johnson disturbing their cobwebs as \u201ca bit of fun\u201d, and estimate there are between three and four units in an entire wine box. All of the above is the fault of 100% of the men at said event. \u201cI\u2019ve actually discovered we would have more sovereignty as a province of Canada,\u201d one stood up to drone. \u201cCould we apply to be a province of Canada?\u201d Do run along and have a crack, sir. I\u2019ll time you.</p> <p>Other personal lowlights? Watching someone who used to be David Cameron\u2019s adviser defending a Johnson grope. Over to this Alex Deane, who told Sky News: \u201cAs the late Alan Clark said: \u2018How do I know my advances are unwanted until I have made them?\u2019\u201d So glad we\u2019re ceding control of our boundaries to a deceased man, born in 1928, who named his dogs after Hitler and Leni Riefenstahl. Listen up, girls: you are getting a full house in crap sex bingo if Alex goes straight for your inner thigh, at the same time as honking: \u201cAnd THEN he said that Michael Heseltine had to buy his own furniture! Yes! Absolute legend!\u201d</p> <p>As it so happened, Alex woke up the next morning and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ajcdeane/status/1178967763093790721\" title=\"\">tweeted his regret</a> at having raised Clark\u2019s point: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t reflect my views, as anyone who knows me will know.\u201d Righto. Even so, one of my very strongest impressions from Manchester was that variations of the phrase \u201cThis is not the man I am\u201d will be used less and less. The Tory MP Sir Desmond Swayne has just got five unapologetic days of publicity out of wearing blackface. First came his column defending Justin Trudeau for doing it, and revealing he himself had worn blackface and would again. Next came the emergence of the pictures in question, at which Desmond took another bite of the apple and <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/desmond-swayne-blackface-tory-mp-racist-james-brown-justin-trudeau-a9123006.html\" title=\"\">again refused to apologise</a>. Meanwhile, outside of Johnson\u2019s speech, the biggest reaction I heard during entire conference was at the Bruges Group event, when a reporter asked the two MPs how they felt about Johnson saying Jo Cox would want Brexit to get done. People were actually baying at the journalist in support of Johnson. With the Charlotte Edwardes disclosure, a quick HazMat dive into social media will confirm that far from giving Johnson\u2019s base pause, it positively energised them.</p> <p>Releasing new polling on Monday, Michael Ashcroft\u2019s summary of his research over the past few weeks was that those making the comparison between Johnson and Donald Trump \u201cwere increasingly likely to mean it in a good way\u201d. Or as one of the PM\u2019s biggest fans, Katie Hopkins, put it: \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/kthopkins/status/1178589278311522304\" title=\"\">Better to be grabbed by the pussy than have a pussy as prime minister</a>.\u201d A real banquet of options, there.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b5e59430fb45d80a6d0f7dc63526964b22131d23\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b5e59430fb45d80a6d0f7dc63526964b22131d23/0_439_6585_3951/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Drowning in his own suit \u2026 Jacob Rees-Mogg.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Drowning in his own suit \u2026 Jacob Rees-Mogg.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Everywhere, Tories seemed to be trying out their new ironicidal style. Rees-Mogg, who still hasn\u2019t noticed his own tailor is trying to drown him, declared: \u201cBut as I grew up in the British establishment, I know how awful it is. I see its faults perhaps more clearly than most do, and its determination, its anti-democratic wish to cling to its power come what may.\u201d I am afraid the phrase \u201cDo me a favour\u201d is simply not up to the task of addressing that. See also John Redwood\u2019s claim that: \u201cAs good democrats we accepted the [EU referendum] result in 1975 and got on with making the best of it.\u201d</p> <p>Language is becoming unmoored from reality. An event called Challenging \u201cIslamophobia\u201d (scare quotes: Tories\u2019 own) turned out to be primarily concerned with ensuring the term wasn\u2019t used at all. The Taxpayers\u2019 Alliance ran two panels called \u201cIs the state killing free speech?\u201d and \u201cAm I allowed to say that?\u201d, featuring people who earn six-figure sums for saying whatever they like on prominent media platforms. Meanwhile, following an increasingly representative statement from Daniel Hannan, positively frothing with terms like \u201cjunta\u201d and \u201ccoup\u201d, the eminent war historian Lawrence Freedman <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LawDavF/status/1178974200788336643\" title=\"\">tweeted a reply</a>: \u201cWords like \u2018coup\u2019 and \u2018junta\u2019 have specific meanings. The Greeks were ruled by a real military junta from 1967 to 1974. These words have no meaning in situations where you just don\u2019t like what an elected parliament is doing.\u201d</p> <p>After these four days in Manchester, it\u2019s difficult to escape the impression that this kind of rationality is going rapidly out of fashion. We are firmly through the looking glass now, and the prime minister is playing ever more dangerously with the political matches. That IS the man he is. It DOES reflect the person those who know him would recognise. And a lot of people currently love him very much for it. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floreat_Etona!\" title=\"\">Floreat shitbird</a>.</p>",

Those words would have been a way more appropriate backdrop to the spectacle of various cabinet ministers squirming over whether the PM groping the upper inner thigh of a woman would be one of their personal red lines. Pressed on the Charlotte Edwardes claims, Matt Hancock blathered that he did have red lines that would force his cabinet resignation, but he wasn\u2019t going to say them out loud. Oh, Matt. Is one of them \u201cblowing a customs official to secure the release of the Fyre festival\u2019s Evian water\u201d? Because, you know \u2026 convince me you wouldn\u2019t. Hancock went on to imply that unwanted touching of women was OK because Johnson has \u201cnever lectured other people on their private lives\u201d. Yup, shit show at the fuck factory. Still, here he comes, Sex Wonka, raising hopes and denying gropes. Boris Johnson\u2019s most amusing viral moment from Manchester featured one aide passing him a cup, only for another aide to snatch it back with the hissed words: \u201cNo. Disposable. Cups.\u201d I suppose it\u2019s very remotely possible this is something to do with \u201cthe environment\u201d, though the cup didn\u2019t even get a single use. But surely the more likely theory is that the prime minister never uses a hairbrush or drinks out of disposable cups because he daren\u2019t risk a DNA test. One of the No 10 aides in question was Rob Oxley, a chap whose other eyecatching move at the conference was to enter the press room on Sunday evening with an imperious: \u201cOne from each, one from each.\u201d Once one reporter from each paper had been martialled, Oxley told them the Edwardes allegations were untrue. No questions permitted. Had he been under the dinner table in question at the time? Inquiring minds want to know. Britain is now basically governed by a Jeremy Kyle villain who knows the ancient Greek for humbug. Boris Johnson\u2019s own foreword to the conference programme declared that he felt, in Manchester, \u201cthe same throb of possibility every time I visit\u201d. As you\u2019d expect from someone whose personal philosophy is \u201cno throb unyielded to\u201d. Beyond the security cordon in the real country \u2013 all those wonderful people out there in the dark \u2013 Johnson\u2019s latest polling puts him on a minus 18 approval rating. He\u2019s as popular as ebola on a chemo ward \u2013 and yet, he is still 42 (FORTY-TWO) points ahead of Jeremy Corbyn. Having not seen a policy since three Christmases ago, the Tories now hallucinate five before breakfast. To kick off conference, Johnson announced he would be building 40 new hospitals. (With what? Playmobil? Wine crates? We didn\u2019t hear; the figure later seems to have been commuted to six.) Andrew Bridgen literally proposed a monorail. Also being promised was limitless cheap nuclear energy within 20 years. This really is fully automated luxury WTFery. I\u2019m amazed they didn\u2019t float mining the asteroid belt. Maybe during the election. And so to the programme of events. Given where we are with Brexit, never has the usual portentous timetable looked more absurd. You could attend endless panels with titles such as \u201cAI: Could we? Should we?\u201d or \u201cThe future of capitalism\u201d. JUST TELL US WHAT\u2019S GOING TO HAPPEN IN FOUR WEEKS, YOU MAD BASTARDS. Johnson and Cummings\u2019 commitment to a no-spoilers Brexit is so total that they haven\u2019t even told Jacob Rees-Mogg or Arlene Foster their plan. But don\u2019t worry. As John Redwood put it: \u201cIt will work because we\u2019ve got some technology.\u201d But what technology? The Conservatives couldn\u2019t even update their conference app. Throughout the four days, it still showed a welter of what we might call ghost ship events, such as a big Q&amp;A with Rory Stewart, who was not in Manchester on account of not being in the Conservative party any more. Guys, you know if it\u2019s digital, you can update it at any time, yes? Maybe it\u2019s because the prime minister thinks \u201ctechnology lessons\u201d involve dancing poles. So they did try to change the app, but thought the way you did that was by twirling seductively into an inverted splits hold, while tossing your hair to Donna Summer\u2019s She Works Hard for the Money. You could learn a lot from freeze-framing the conference at exactly the same point a year apart. On the Tuesday morning last year, prime minister Theresa May was asked in a radio interview about the manner in which Boris Johnson had stolen all her conference headlines. She replied: \u201cI\u2019m concentrating on what is important, which is getting a good deal for the UK.\u201d On the Tuesday morning this year, prime minister Boris Johnson was asked in a radio interview about Edwardes\u2019 headline account of his grope. He replied: \u201cI think what the public want to hear is about what we are doing to level up and unite the country.\u201d I wonder where we\u2019ll be in 2020. Maybe cabinet minister Nigel Farage will deflect from the emergence of his financial ties to the Russian government\u2019s covert sex robot building programme with the words: \u201cI am focused on what people want, which is delivering our domestic agenda.\u201d Like all his other urges, the PM can\u2019t suppress his irritation at even being asked about such things. How can this still be happening to him, now he is king of the gods? I do feel Johnson has been historically hampered by his inability to conduct assignations with mortal women by disguising himself as a swan, say, or a shower of gold. He has only ever taken the form of Boris Johnson. That said, there is an enchanting picture of Jennifer Arcuri \u2013 the grant-receiving model/tech entrepreneur in whose pole-dancing-equipped flat Johnson is reported to have had afternoon technology lessons \u2013 in which Arcuri is shown looming over a London mayor-themed cake. In an image that might be captioned Attack of the 50 Foot Infosec Woman, Jennifer is gleefully biting the head of one of three fondant Boris Johnsons to adorn it. Did Zeus ever appear as an icing figurine? I must look it up before Priti Patel announces a book-burning initiative. In general, the hall reaction to speakers was muted. This is a revenue-gathering sort of gathering. In recent years, the dwindling band of elderly activists has been gradually replaced by an army of lobbyists for one form of Big Shittery or another. Even cabinet emoji Liz Truss could barely raise a laugh, while Patel should slap a whole life tariff on Northern Powerhouse minister Jake Berry for the following: \u201cThe only homes we are not going to build in the north of England is Sherlock Holmes!\u201d Jake, you can\u2019t even build a joke. It feels incredibly unlikely that you\u2019re going to be up to renewing the north. Even Johnson didn\u2019t really do the business, and they missed yet another trick not making his entrance music Shaggy\u2019s It Wasn\u2019t Me. Declaiming welcome lies about having cleared up Britain\u2019s debt, and eyebrow-raisers like \u201cthe cocaine habits of the bourgeoisie\u201d, the prime minister looks like a man who answered a casting call searching for \u201ca Gary Busey type\u201d. He still dresses like someone who was last night banished to sleep in the car. Having said that, what was once a careless affectation increasingly begins to look essential. Not having a stylish uniform is one of the crucial bulwarks between Boris Johnson and a number of unfortunate historical #inspo associations. It\u2019s not just the use of terms like \u201csurrender act\u201d, which have to be said 437 times every day. This was a conference at which you could also repeatedly hear that parliament was illegitimate, the Benn Act was constitutionally illegitimate, and that the government could and should, in the words of one Brexiter, \u201csubvert it by any means necessary\u201d. On the fringe, panel composition tended toward the Sartrean. One completely packed event by the Bruges Group, held at Manchester\u2019s Comedy Store \u2013 leave it, it\u2019s not worth it \u2013 featured John Redwood, Mark Francois and Arlene Foster. All killers, no fillers. I\u2019m kidding, of course. There was actually a fourth panellist, in the form of a Brexit QC. But the main draw was Francois, who now gets the sort of reception you might expect Galatasaray fans to give Sergio Ramos if he signed for them. \u201cI\u2019ve got a feeling one or two of you might have heard Mark Francois speak before,\u201d trilled the chair, who went on to say that Mark \u201chas used his experience in the territorial army and his MA in war studies to great effect\u201d. A reminder that the definition of politics as the art of the possible is no substitute for wriggling through Epping Forest on your tummy dreaming of Rommel every second weekend. In fact, put like that it\u2019s incredible that we STILL haven\u2019t Brexited, until you remember that Mark has voted a full three times, and at every time of asking, not to leave the EU. Once he\u2019d announced his forthcoming book - it will be called You Couldn\u2019t Make It Up, a title previously used by both Jeremy Kyle and Richard Littlejohn \u2013 Mark\u2019s Bruges Group headline appearance concluded with a stark warning to parliamentarians. \u201cAsk not for whom the bell tolls,\u201d ran this thundering salvo. \u201cIt tolls for them.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s amazing, isn\u2019t he?\u201d sighed the woman in the row behind me. I would estimate that at the Bruges Group, a scientific 83% of the women in the audience own cooking aprons printed with the torso of a French maid, would regard Boris Johnson disturbing their cobwebs as \u201ca bit of fun\u201d, and estimate there are between three and four units in an entire wine box. All of the above is the fault of 100% of the men at said event. \u201cI\u2019ve actually discovered we would have more sovereignty as a province of Canada,\u201d one stood up to drone. \u201cCould we apply to be a province of Canada?\u201d Do run along and have a crack, sir. I\u2019ll time you. Other personal lowlights? Watching someone who used to be David Cameron\u2019s adviser defending a Johnson grope. Over to this Alex Deane, who told Sky News: \u201cAs the late Alan Clark said: \u2018How do I know my advances are unwanted until I have made them?\u2019\u201d So glad we\u2019re ceding control of our boundaries to a deceased man, born in 1928, who named his dogs after Hitler and Leni Riefenstahl. Listen up, girls: you are getting a full house in crap sex bingo if Alex goes straight for your inner thigh, at the same time as honking: \u201cAnd THEN he said that Michael Heseltine had to buy his own furniture! Yes! Absolute legend!\u201d As it so happened, Alex woke up the next morning and tweeted his regret at having raised Clark\u2019s point: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t reflect my views, as anyone who knows me will know.\u201d Righto. Even so, one of my very strongest impressions from Manchester was that variations of the phrase \u201cThis is not the man I am\u201d will be used less and less. The Tory MP Sir Desmond Swayne has just got five unapologetic days of publicity out of wearing blackface. First came his column defending Justin Trudeau for doing it, and revealing he himself had worn blackface and would again. Next came the emergence of the pictures in question, at which Desmond took another bite of the apple and again refused to apologise. Meanwhile, outside of Johnson\u2019s speech, the biggest reaction I heard during entire conference was at the Bruges Group event, when a reporter asked the two MPs how they felt about Johnson saying Jo Cox would want Brexit to get done. People were actually baying at the journalist in support of Johnson. With the Charlotte Edwardes disclosure, a quick HazMat dive into social media will confirm that far from giving Johnson\u2019s base pause, it positively energised them. Releasing new polling on Monday, Michael Ashcroft\u2019s summary of his research over the past few weeks was that those making the comparison between Johnson and Donald Trump \u201cwere increasingly likely to mean it in a good way\u201d. Or as one of the PM\u2019s biggest fans, Katie Hopkins, put it: \u201cBetter to be grabbed by the pussy than have a pussy as prime minister.\u201d A real banquet of options, there. Everywhere, Tories seemed to be trying out their new ironicidal style. Rees-Mogg, who still hasn\u2019t noticed his own tailor is trying to drown him, declared: \u201cBut as I grew up in the British establishment, I know how awful it is. I see its faults perhaps more clearly than most do, and its determination, its anti-democratic wish to cling to its power come what may.\u201d I am afraid the phrase \u201cDo me a favour\u201d is simply not up to the task of addressing that. See also John Redwood\u2019s claim that: \u201cAs good democrats we accepted the [EU referendum] result in 1975 and got on with making the best of it.\u201d Language is becoming unmoored from reality. An event called Challenging \u201cIslamophobia\u201d (scare quotes: Tories\u2019 own) turned out to be primarily concerned with ensuring the term wasn\u2019t used at all. The Taxpayers\u2019 Alliance ran two panels called \u201cIs the state killing free speech?\u201d and \u201cAm I allowed to say that?\u201d, featuring people who earn six-figure sums for saying whatever they like on prominent media platforms. Meanwhile, following an increasingly representative statement from Daniel Hannan, positively frothing with terms like \u201cjunta\u201d and \u201ccoup\u201d, the eminent war historian Lawrence Freedman tweeted a reply: \u201cWords like \u2018coup\u2019 and \u2018junta\u2019 have specific meanings. The Greeks were ruled by a real military junta from 1967 to 1974. These words have no meaning in situations where you just don\u2019t like what an elected parliament is doing.\u201d After these four days in Manchester, it\u2019s difficult to escape the impression that this kind of rationality is going rapidly out of fashion. We are firmly through the looking glass now, and the prime minister is playing ever more dangerously with the political matches. That IS the man he is. It DOES reflect the person those who know him would recognise. And a lot of people currently love him very much for it. Floreat shitbird.",

The prime minister is said to be furious at the claims by journalist Charlotte Edwardes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/29/no-10-denies-claims-boris-johnson-squeezed-thigh-journalist-charlotte-edwardes\">that at a private lunch in 1999</a>, Johnson touched her leg under a table, grabbing \u201cenough inner flesh beneath his fingers\u201d to make her \u201csit upright\u201d. Downing Street insiders privately described the claims as \u201cbollocks\u201d and \u201cnonsense\u201d. Edwardes tweeted on Sunday night: \u201cIf the prime minister doesn\u2019t recollect the incident then clearly I have a better memory than he does.\u201d Johnson also remains under pressure over his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/29/boris-johnson-no-interest-to-declare-in-arcuri-firm\">relationship with American tech entrepreneur Jennifer Arcuri</a>, whose company received a public grant. Conference delegates, meanwhile, can expect plenty of references <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/29/ex-minister-rejects-allegations-rebels-colluded-with-eu-to-stop-no-deal\">to the \u201csurrender act\u201d</a> after the PM refused to moderate his language and repeated the phrase a dozen times on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr programme yesterday.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Whistleblower safety</strong> \u2013 Lawyers acting for the whistleblower at the centre of the impeachment scandal say President Trump\u2019s remarks are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/30/donald-trump-has-put-whistleblower-in-danger-lawyers-say-ukraine-impeachment\">putting their client in danger</a>. Andrew Bakaj said Trump\u2019s demands to know the identity of the whistleblower have led to safety concerns, and a $50,000 reward for information that would identify him or her. Bakaj has called on senior Democratic and Republican leaders to \u201cspeak out in favour of whistleblower protection\u201d. On Sunday night, Trump tweeted: \u201cI deserve to meet my accuser, especially when this accuser, the so-called \u2018Whistleblower\u2019, represented a perfect conversation with a foreign leader in a totally inaccurate and fraudulent way\u201d. He also quoted a Fox News guest who said \u201cremoving the President from office (which they will never be), it will cause a Civil War like fracture in this Nation from which our Country will never heal\u201d. It followed a weekend of Trump defenders,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/29/rudy-giuliani-donald-trump-ukraine-impeachment-inquiry\"> led by his lawyer Rudy Guiliani</a>, attacking the unnamed whistleblower in an attempt to push back against the rapidly intensifying impeachment inquiry.

Williamson, who will announce the policy at the party conference, will say courses could become more popular than universities and that the new institutes of technology are intended to end the sector\u2019s image as a poor relation. They come on top of an additional \u00a3400m in funding for further education and sixth-form colleges announced at the end of last month.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Far-right vote collapses</strong> \u2013 Austria\u2019s Freedom party has lost <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/29/austrian-elections-exit-polls-collapse-far-right-support-sebastian-kurz-victory\">more than a third of its support</a>, in elections in which it was punished over a corruption scandal that brought down the government. The former chancellor Sebastian Kurz, 33, looks certain to reclaim his position as the youngest leader in the world after his conservative People\u2019s party (\u00d6VP) secured 37.1% of the vote \u2013 its best result since 2002. The Freedom party\u2019s vote fell to 16%, while the Green party jumped to its best result at national elections with 14%. Kurz signalled on Sunday night that he was willing to enter coalition talks with both the Freedom party and the Green party.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Heart attacks</strong> \u2013 Women are dying from heart attacks unnecessarily because of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/sep/30/women-are-dying-needlessly-from-heart-attacks-says-charity\">mistaken perception that they mostly happen to men</a>. Inequalities at every stage lead to women being diagnosed late and not getting the prompt treatment and aftercare they need to survive a heart attack, according to the British Heart Foundation. Research shows that more than 8,000 women died between 2002 and 2013 in England and Wales because they did not receive the same standard of care as men.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Asleep at the wheel? </strong>\u2013 There are calls for truck drivers to be routinely tested for sleep apnoea after an Italian study found that half <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/sep/30/truck-drivers-should-be-routinely-tested-for-sleep-apnoea\">suffer from breathing disorders. </a>The survey of 905 truck drivers found that approximately half suffered from at least one sleep-related breathing problem that could potentially cause them to fall asleep at the wheel. Researchers found that 77% were overweight or obese. According to Luca Roberti, president of the Italian sleep apnoea patient association, \u201cthis is due to a lifestyle that forces the drivers to sit for several hours a day, with little physical activity and a poor diet, leading to a greater risk of excessive daytime sleepiness and of dozing off unexpectedly while driving.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Today in Focus podcast: Is it over for Justin Trudeau?</h2> \n<p>Justin Trudeau achieved a historic victory in 2015 but as he nears the end of his first term a series of scandals are making his political future far less certain.

They come on top of an additional \u00a3400m in funding for further education and sixth-form colleges announced at the end of last month. * * * Far-right vote collapses \u2013 Austria\u2019s Freedom party has lost more than a third of its support, in elections in which it was punished over a corruption scandal that brought down the government. The former chancellor Sebastian Kurz, 33, looks certain to reclaim his position as the youngest leader in the world after his conservative People\u2019s party (\u00d6VP) secured 37.1% of the vote \u2013 its best result since 2002. The Freedom party\u2019s vote fell to 16%, while the Green party jumped to its best result at national elections with 14%. Kurz signalled on Sunday night that he was willing to enter coalition talks with both the Freedom party and the Green party. * * * Heart attacks \u2013 Women are dying from heart attacks unnecessarily because of the mistaken perception that they mostly happen to men. Inequalities at every stage lead to women being diagnosed late and not getting the prompt treatment and aftercare they need to survive a heart attack, according to the British Heart Foundation. Research shows that more than 8,000 women died between 2002 and 2013 in England and Wales because they did not receive the same standard of care as men. * * * Asleep at the wheel? \u2013 There are calls for truck drivers to be routinely tested for sleep apnoea after an Italian study found that half suffer from breathing disorders. The survey of 905 truck drivers found that approximately half suffered from at least one sleep-related breathing problem that could potentially cause them to fall asleep at the wheel. Researchers found that 77% were overweight or obese. According to Luca Roberti, president of the Italian sleep apnoea patient association, \u201cthis is due to a lifestyle that forces the drivers to sit for several hours a day, with little physical activity and a poor diet, leading to a greater risk of excessive daytime sleepiness and of dozing off unexpectedly while driving.\u201d Today in Focus podcast: Is it over for Justin Trudeau? Justin Trudeau achieved a historic victory in 2015 but as he nears the end of his first term a series of scandals are making his political future far less certain. With Canada going to the polls next month, journalist Leyland Cecco discusses how likely it is Trudeau will repeat his initial success And: Kaitlyn Regehr on why new sex education lessons in schools are already outdated. Lunchtime read: \u2018Now it\u2019s just ghosts\u2019 Four years of war has devastated Yemen, bringing suffering beyond recognition, writes Bethan McKernan, who has travelled on a rare 6,000km journey through the country\u2019s patchwork of factions in its bitter civil war: \u201cDeath comes from above at any time. Over a lunch of chicken, rice and sweet honeyed fatteh, the unmistakable thud of a nearby missile shook the windows of a restaurant. The diners paid no attention to the whine of the Saudi warplane even as it circled back for a second, third and fourth hit. \u201cBut the regional power\u2019s scorched earth policy in this proxy war has brought it no closer to victory. With Iran\u2019s help, the Houthi forces now possess sophisticated drone technology and can launch cross-border rocket attacks deep into Saudi Arabia, targeting assets such as oilfields, military bases and airports. Some call this the Kingdom\u2019s Vietnam, but it could be much, much worse. The victims are ordinary Yemenis, who are paying an extraordinary price.\u201d Sport Dina Asher-Smith was able to savour a stunning 100m personal best, a new national record of 10.83sec and, most of all, a sparkling silver medal after finishing behind the legendary Jamaican Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce at the World Athletics Championships in Doha. Australia\u2019s rugby vice-captain, Samu Kerevi, has called on authorities to bring in players to advise on the regulations covering the contact area, fearing that the game will cease to be a collision sport and become \u201csoft\u201d, after he was penalised in the game against Wales on Sunday. Beauden, Jordie and Scott Barrett will become the first trio of brothers to appear for the All Blacks in a World Cup match after they were named to start for the three-times world champions against Canada. Riyad Mahrez decorated Manchester City\u2019s victory against Everton on Saturday with a glittering display that left Pep Guardiola purring over his \u201cgift\u201d. And cycling\u2019s world time trial champion Rohan Dennis, who defended his crown just last week in Harrogate, has had his contract with race team Bahrain-Merida terminated with immediate effect. Business Sir Philip Green\u2019s Miss Selfridge chain posted a \u00a317.5m loss last year as sales fell and it wrote down the value of loss-making stores. Sales at the youth fashion chain fell more than 15% to \u00a3102m in the year to 1 September 2018, while pretax losses more than quadrupled from \u00a34.3m a year before. Losses widened after more than \u00a312m in one-off costs mostly related to property writedowns were added, as well as redundancies. The pound is buying $1.229 and \u20ac1.124. The papers Boris Johnson remains front and centre on many of today\u2019s papers, with the Telegraph reporting a \u201cPlot to force Johnson into Brexit extension\u201d, in a story that claims opposition leaders will meet to see how they can force him into requesting an extension of Article 50. The Mirror says the PM\u2019s connection with US businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri is an \u201cabuse of power\u201d. The FT has \u201cDUP balks at Johnson plans\u201d. The Mail also carries a picture of Johnson with the headline: \u201cBoris\u2019s blonde \u2018told her friends they DID have an affair\u201d (but saves the most space for \u201cWomen driven to the brink by care crisis\u201d). The Guardian has \u201cPrime minister forced into denial of claims he groped two women\u201d, but it saves its splash for the devastating civil war in Yemen. The Express gives Johnson some support before his party\u2019s conference: \u201cBoris rally cry: get Brexit done to fix divided Britain\u201d but leads on \u201cBumper rise for pensions\u201d. The Times ignores Johnson and and Brexit altogether and opts for \u201cChildren face ban from school if not vaccinated\u201d. The i also splashes on that story with \u201cCompulsory vaccinated targeted for UK children\u201d. And the Sun has splashed on an \u201cexclusive\u201d about the \u201cPurrminator\u201d, a \u201cmonster puss(cat)\u201d on the loose in Hampstead.

Trump also attacked the anonymous intelligence official responsible for bringing the conversation to light, a move intended to dissuade future whistleblowers. Risky business. Trump\u2019s aura of invincibility at last appears to have been dented, writes Tom McCarthy. But, as Lauren Gambino reports, the impeachment process also carries risks for the Democrats. Unintended comedy. Trump came face to face with a seemingly bewildered Zelenskiy at the UN general assembly in New York, where the two former TV stars met on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the White House mistakenly emailed its talking points on the scandal to Democratic leaders. Fired EPA scientists to reconvene in snub to Trump An advisory panel of 20 air pollution scientists dismissed from the Environmental Protection Agency by the Trump administration intends to reconvene and continue its work outside government, assembling at a Washington DC hotel a year to the day since its official disbandment. The Guardian has learned Trump\u2019s pick to lead the Fish and Wildlife Service, Aurelia Skipwith, has ties to agricultural groups opposed to protections for endangered species. Indigenous representative. An indigenous representative has addressed the UN climate summit in a formal capacity for the first time. Tuntiak Katan of the Ecuadorian Shuar people told the event indigenous peoples \u201cprotect 80% of the world\u2019s biodiversity\u201d. Climate deniers. A group of Australian mining engineers and business figures has signed up to a declaration claiming \u201cthere is no climate emergency\u201d and insisting \u201cCO2 is plant food\u201d. LA police enabled Ed Buck by \u2018ignoring gay black men\u2019 Ed Buck, a prominent Los Angeles political activist who stands accused of forcibly injecting black gay men with fatal doses of methamphetamine, got away with his crimes because the police ignored evidence and the testimony of the black gay men who spoke up, the mother of one of his victims has claimed. LaTisha Nixon\u2019s 26-year-old son, Gemmel Moore, died from an overdose at Buck\u2019s West Hollywood apartment in July 2017. \u201cI\u2019m a grieving mother, but [law enforcement treated us like criminals,\u201d she said. \u2018Violent predator\u2019. Buck, 65, was arrested last week. Prosecutors called him a \u201cviolent sexual predator\u201d who had at least 11 victims, two of whom died, including Timothy Dean, who had a fatal overdose at Buck\u2019s home in January. Boris Johnson urged to calm \u2018inferno of rhetoric\u2019 British MPs on the left and right have urged the prime minister, Boris Johnson, to temper his rhetoric over Brexit after an acrimonious return to the House of Commons on Wednesday. Following the UK supreme court\u2019s ruling that the prime minister\u2019s advice to the Queen to suspend parliament was unlawful, an unrepentant Johnson dismissed the suggestion his use of inflammatory language such as \u201csurrender\u201d and \u201cbetrayal\u201d was dangerous as \u201chumbug\u201d. Jo Cox. Johnson drew gasps of shock in the Commons when he referred to the Labour MP Jo Cox, an ardent remainer murdered in the run-up to the Brexit vote in 2016. Johnson claimed the best way to honour Cox\u2019s memory was to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d. Cheat sheet Pakistan\u2019s prime minister, Imran Khan, has said he is trying to draw international attention to the danger of war breaking out between his country and India, which both have nuclear weapons, over the disputed territory of Kashmir. Israel\u2019s president, Reuven Rivlin, has asked Benjamin Netanyahu to try to form a coalition government, in an effort to break the deadlock between the incumbent prime minister and opposition leader Benny Gantz, after the country\u2019s inconclusive election. Elizabeth Warren has topped a national poll of Democratic presidential candidates for the first time, in a Quinnipiac survey that puts the Massachusetts senator on 27% to Biden\u2019s 25%, with Bernie Sanders trailing on 16%. Samuel L Jackson has signed up to be the first celebrity voice of Alexa, Amazon\u2019s virtual personal assistant, allowing users to interact with an AI version of the Pulp Fiction star, developed using the company\u2019s neural text-to-speech technology. Must-reads Zero stars for Zeroville, the worst film of 2019 James Franco had directed several little-seen literary adaptations, including two based onbooks by William Faulkner, before tackling the dense Hollywood novel Zeroville in 2014. Finally released on three US screens this month, his film version is \u201ca work of rarefied and powerful badness,\u201d says Charles Bramesco. Life as a cancer patient When Anne Boyer was diagnosed with highly aggressive breast cancer, she was offered a cure so poisonous that, if she survived, she could lose her eyesight, speech and memory. \u201cMy body feels like it is dying as a side-effect of what is promised to keep it alive,\u201d she writes. Buttigieg faces new criticism from South Bend\u2019s black leaders The South Bend mayor, Pete Buttigieg, was the rising star of the Democratic presidential primary, until his progress was hindered by the fallout from a police shooting in his city in March. Now, he is again being criticised by some of the city\u2019s black leaders over policing-related controversies, as Tom Perkins reports. Trudeau\u2019s poor constituents \u2018pushed out\u2019 by development As if Justin Trudeau were not facing enough controversy on the national stage, trouble is brewing in his Montreal constituency, too. Parc-Extension is one of the poorest neighbourhoods in Canada. Now, writes Flavie Halais, some fear a new C$348m ($263m) university campus will gentrify the district beyond recognition. Opinion Women still earn less than men, but the work environment is changing slowly for the better, says Gene Marks. And nothing sends that message more clearly than a survey that found 42% of US businesses are owned by women. In what could be a response to lower pay at their place of employment, more women than ever \u2013 particularly women of color \u2013 are also starting up side businesses. Sport England\u2019s plan for their Rugby World Cup tie against the USA in Japan on Thursday is to get the job done as simply and effectively as possible. But the Eagles, featuring several seasoned pros such as Joe Taufete\u2019e, will not necessarily make it easy for them, says Robert Kitson. The former New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski recently claimed to have ameliorated his CTE \u2013 a result of the 20 concussions he received while playing \u2013 using CBD products. But he was dangerously wrong to suggest the condition is \u201cfixable\u201d, says Ian McMahan. Sign up The US morning briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes every weekday.

Of the approximately 30,000 people who live in Parc-Ex, 61% were born outside Canada. The area is one of the country\u2019s poorest: 43% of households live below the poverty line, perhaps a somewhat surprising fact given that it is also part of the Papineau electoral district represented by Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau .</p> <p>Despite being located in the centre of bustling Montreal, Parc-Ex feels isolated and is physically closed off from the rest of the city by borders on all sides. There\u2019s a highway to the north, a large park to the east, train tracks to the south and a fence to the west, built by a posher neighbouring borough.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The arrival of the University of Montreal has created havoc</p> <footer> <cite>Parc-Ex resident</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This month, however, Parc-Ex is being plugged back into the heart of the city in a project that some are hailing as transformative but othersfear will gentrify the district beyond recognition, pushing out current residents.</p> <p>The project, dubbed Mil, is a C$348m (\u00a3210m) development by the University of Montreal which will transform a 38 hectare site that was formerly old rail yard into a vast new campus. Mil stands for Montreal Innovation Laboratory, but also plays on the word <em>milieu</em> (middle), a nod to its city centre location.</p> <p>The first stage of the development is now open: a new complex for the university\u2019s science department, which hosts a daily influx of 2,200 students, faculty and staff. The next stage of development will include condominiums, office buildings and public spaces.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9926c94c9f7b41d212fc08edadcee082110aa211\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9926c94c9f7b41d212fc08edadcee082110aa211/0_93_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The first stage of the Mil development is now open and hosts 2,200 students, faculty and staff daily.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The first stage of the Mil development is now open and hosts 2,200 students, faculty and staff daily.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marc Bruxelle/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Beyond the rare opportunity for a city to develop 53 football pitches\u2019 worth of prime real estate, Mil is intended to bolster Montreal\u2019s reputation as a hub for AI research. The new campus will be located close to the university\u2019s AI research centre, Mila, in the nearby industrial Marconi-Alexandra area. The hope is that Parc-Ex will become the next Mile End, a Montreal neighbourhood transformed by the arrival of game giant Ubisoft.</p> <p>The government is investing C$84m into the Mil project, and Trudeau has promoted the plan as a way of boosting Montreal\u2019s intellectual capital as a cornerstone of economic growth.</p> <p>In turn, the university is portraying Mil as a lifeline for Parc-Ex. The development will see the district connected to the well-off, mostly Francophone, borough of Outremont via a pedestrian bridge over the tracks.</p> <p>\u201cWe believe that opening up neighbourhoods and sectors contributes to improving people\u2019s quality of life,\u201d says university spokesperson Genevi\u00e8ve O\u2019Meara.</p> <p>But as the campus opens, Parc-Ex residents are grappling with the consequences of their neighbourhood\u2019s newfound attractiveness. New condo developments are multiplying near the subway station, and homeowners report being pressured into selling their properties by developers. In recent months, the community group Comit\u00e9 d\u2019Action de Parc-Extension (Cape) has documented a spike in evictions and unlawful rent increases.</p> <p>To make matters worse, Montreal is in the midst of a housing crunch, and vacancy rates in Parc-Ex are <a href=\"https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/gentrification-brings-rising-rent-to-notoriously-affordable-park-ex-1.4489018\">at an all-time low</a>, leaving displaced residents scrambling to find affordable housing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4a36caf92b5204a6e7678e7cda7990e09c308301\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a36caf92b5204a6e7678e7cda7990e09c308301/0_161_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The science complex on the University of Montreal\u2019s new Mil campus.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The science complex on the University of Montreal\u2019s new Mil campus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marc Bruxelle/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One resident of Parc-Ex who was evicted earlier this year found herself in a frantic search for new housing for her two sons, one of whom has a disability and attends a special school. \u201cIt was just a horrible, horrible experience being in this mad rush of people just panicking and trying to get a place,\u201d she says. Eventually she found an apartment. It costs C$400 (\u00a3242) more per month than her previous residence, and is roughly half the size.</p> <p>\u201cI just became desperate,\u201d she says of her decision to accept the new, worse reality. \u201cI was so afraid of becoming homeless.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018Parc-Ex was an anomaly\u2019</h2> <p>Until now, Parc-Ex has remained mostly immune to the gentrification forces that have filled Montreal with hip coffee shops, cocktail bars and yoga studios. It is a lively, unassuming neighbourhood, with tree-lined residential streets filled with low-rise apartments, shops catering to multiple ethnic groups, and numerous places of worship. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Most people here earn the minimum wage, some are on welfare. If the university brings improvements, they won\u2019t benefit those people</p> <footer> <cite>Parc-Ex resident</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It is also a precarious place. While older generations of immigrants (notably a large Greek population) were able to buy their homes, 78% of today\u2019s residents are renters. Many of the newcomers from south-east Asia, Africa and the Caribbean are those seeking refugee status, undocumented migrants, temporary workers and immigrants of colour \u2013 all groups who face higher barriers to integration.</p> <p>\u201cParc-Ex was sort of an anomaly,\u201d says Rachel Shugart, a Parc-Ex resident and former program director of the <a href=\"https://www.welcomecollective.org/\">Welcome Collective</a>, a nonprofit group that helps refugee claimants through their first few months in Montreal.</p> <p>\u201cThe apartments that are available for the poorest, most vulnerable families are only low-price, despite their central position, despite their walkability, because the buildings are in such bad shape. They\u2019re really terrible apartments, and nobody else would take them if they had any other options.\u201d</p> <p>In 2011, the city\u2019s public health department found that 25.9% of Parc-Ex families with young children were<a href=\"https://santemontreal.qc.ca/fileadmin/fichiers/professionnels/DRSP/Directeur/Rapports/Rapport_ISS-2011.pdf\"> living in housing infested with cockroaches</a>. Bugs, mice, rats, mould and other problems are common, and the city has launched a campaign to send more inspectors after neglectful landlords.</p> <p>But while Montreal had until now avoided the worst of the housing inflation that has seized other large Canadian cities, thanks in part to generous tenant laws that cap rent increases and restrict evictions, times are changing. Property prices are <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/montreal-rental-market-cmhc-1.4925890\">rising</a>, putting additional pressure on Parc-Ex.</p> <p>\u201cThe real estate market has been gaining momentum for a dozen years, but in the past two years, it\u2019s been disproportionate,\u201d says Faiz Abhuani. Abuhani runs <a href=\"http://www.briqueparbrique.com/en/brickbybrick/\">Brick by Brick</a>, which raises community bonds to purchase properties and turn them into affordable housing in Parc-Ex. The spike in prices, he says, has dashed his hopes of making deals any time soon.</p> <p>Now, the Mil project is bringing that pressure directly into the heart of Parc-Ex.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"699a22a947e9a9b6420820a096647eec32b31272\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/699a22a947e9a9b6420820a096647eec32b31272/0_7_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Is the new university development a lifeline for isolated, impoverished Parc-Ex or problematic gentrification?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Is the new university development a lifeline for isolated, impoverished Parc-Ex or problematic gentrification?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Hughes/The Canadian Press/PA Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are no official statistics on rent increases or evictions, but Cape says it helped close to 500 tenants in the first half of 2019. Of those, 21 were being pushed out illegally and 16 had been pressured to leave. Since last year there has been \u201ca significant increase in the number of people coming to see us for questions relating to rent increases, repossessions, and major renovations,\u201d says Cape\u2019s Amy Darwish.</p> <p>The tension is also being ratcheted up by Montreal\u2019s long-time effort to create jobs and raise the tax base by attracting the tech, creative and knowledge industries. Mile End quickly gentrified after Ubisoft moved in, aided by tax credits. As Mil opens there is also a push to attract AI companies to the Marconi-Alexandra area where the University of Montreal\u2019s Mila research centre is located, as well as companies such as Element AI; in September Microsoft will <a href=\"https://news.microsoft.com/en-ca/features/microsoft-research-montreal-moves-to-montreal-ai-hub/\">move into a new research lab</a> a short walk away from Mil.</p> <p>Mil itself represents a \u201cquick fix\u201d for the city to raise revenue, says Norma Rantisi, professor in the geography, planning and environment department at Montreal\u2019s Concordia University.</p> <p>\u201cWhat this Montreal campus represents is a heavily publicly subsidised institution that\u2019s serving the commercialisation of knowledge in ways that are supporting private sector endeavours,\u201d she says, \u201cbut at the same time putting at risk a lot of the lower-income residents and lower-income establishments.\u201d</p> <p> Critics say the university should be paying more attention to its immediate impact on the neighbourhoods where it is located.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7a72a925b42f4574922c69902f0cc1664ac7e7ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a72a925b42f4574922c69902f0cc1664ac7e7ae/0_139_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A coffee shop for self-employed workers, in Mile End, an area that rapidly gentrified with the arrival of games giant Ubisoft.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A coffee shop for self-employed workers, in Mile End, an area that rapidly gentrified with the arrival of games giant Ubisoft.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alice Chiche/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Research has shown that large institutions can<a href=\"https://democracycollaborative.org/higher-ed-anchor-mission\"> leverage their economic power</a> to spur inclusive growth in surrounding communities. The University of Toronto has launched an <a href=\"https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/partnerships/sites/utsc.utoronto.ca.partnerships/files/docs/Community_Partnerships_2017.pdf\">Anchor Strategy</a> for its campus in Scarborough, one of Canada\u2019s most multicultural areas, which includes reforming its procurement process to bring in more diverse and local enterprises on campus, and increasing employment and training opportunities for nearby residents. Drexel University in Philadelphia, US, found that its <a href=\"https://drexel.edu/civicengagement/centers-initiatives/economic-inclusion/step-by-step/hire-local/\">Hire Local</a> initiative led to <a href=\"https://www.cupahr.org/hew/files/Building-Community-Partnerships-for-Local-Hiring.pdf\">decreased turnover rates</a> among staff.</p> <p>By contrast, O\u2019Meara says the University of Montreal hiring process is regulated by collective agreements that prevent it from setting jobs aside for workers from specific parts of the city.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the way campuses used to be built half a century ago,\u201d says Ted Howard of the Democracy Collaborative, which researches the issue. \u201cIf the University of Montreal wants to be a world-class, renown[ed] institution, it can\u2019t simply rely on its teaching and its research, and the intellectual aspect of the institution, as important as that is.

          "bodyText": "Parc-Extension in Montreal, Quebec, is one of Canada\u2019s most ethnically diverse neighbourhoods. Of the approximately 30,000 people who live in Parc-Ex, 61% were born outside Canada. The area is one of the country\u2019s poorest: 43% of households live below the poverty line, perhaps a somewhat surprising fact given that it is also part of the Papineau electoral district represented by Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau . Despite being located in the centre of bustling Montreal, Parc-Ex feels isolated and is physically closed off from the rest of the city by borders on all sides. There\u2019s a highway to the north, a large park to the east, train tracks to the south and a fence to the west, built by a posher neighbouring borough. This month, however, Parc-Ex is being plugged back into the heart of the city in a project that some are hailing as transformative but othersfear will gentrify the district beyond recognition, pushing out current residents. The project, dubbed Mil, is a C$348m (\u00a3210m) development by the University of Montreal which will transform a 38 hectare site that was formerly old rail yard into a vast new campus. Mil stands for Montreal Innovation Laboratory, but also plays on the word milieu (middle), a nod to its city centre location. The first stage of the development is now open: a new complex for the university\u2019s science department, which hosts a daily influx of 2,200 students, faculty and staff. The next stage of development will include condominiums, office buildings and public spaces. Beyond the rare opportunity for a city to develop 53 football pitches\u2019 worth of prime real estate, Mil is intended to bolster Montreal\u2019s reputation as a hub for AI research. The new campus will be located close to the university\u2019s AI research centre, Mila, in the nearby industrial Marconi-Alexandra area. The hope is that Parc-Ex will become the next Mile End, a Montreal neighbourhood transformed by the arrival of game giant Ubisoft. The government is investing C$84m into the Mil project, and Trudeau has promoted the plan as a way of boosting Montreal\u2019s intellectual capital as a cornerstone of economic growth. In turn, the university is portraying Mil as a lifeline for Parc-Ex. The development will see the district connected to the well-off, mostly Francophone, borough of Outremont via a pedestrian bridge over the tracks. \u201cWe believe that opening up neighbourhoods and sectors contributes to improving people\u2019s quality of life,\u201d says university spokesperson Genevi\u00e8ve O\u2019Meara. But as the campus opens, Parc-Ex residents are grappling with the consequences of their neighbourhood\u2019s newfound attractiveness. New condo developments are multiplying near the subway station, and homeowners report being pressured into selling their properties by developers. In recent months, the community group Comit\u00e9 d\u2019Action de Parc-Extension (Cape) has documented a spike in evictions and unlawful rent increases. To make matters worse, Montreal is in the midst of a housing crunch, and vacancy rates in Parc-Ex are at an all-time low, leaving displaced residents scrambling to find affordable housing. One resident of Parc-Ex who was evicted earlier this year found herself in a frantic search for new housing for her two sons, one of whom has a disability and attends a special school. \u201cIt was just a horrible, horrible experience being in this mad rush of people just panicking and trying to get a place,\u201d she says. Eventually she found an apartment. It costs C$400 (\u00a3242) more per month than her previous residence, and is roughly half the size. \u201cI just became desperate,\u201d she says of her decision to accept the new, worse reality. \u201cI was so afraid of becoming homeless.\u201d \u2018Parc-Ex was an anomaly\u2019 Until now, Parc-Ex has remained mostly immune to the gentrification forces that have filled Montreal with hip coffee shops, cocktail bars and yoga studios. It is a lively, unassuming neighbourhood, with tree-lined residential streets filled with low-rise apartments, shops catering to multiple ethnic groups, and numerous places of worship. It is also a precarious place. While older generations of immigrants (notably a large Greek population) were able to buy their homes, 78% of today\u2019s residents are renters. Many of the newcomers from south-east Asia, Africa and the Caribbean are those seeking refugee status, undocumented migrants, temporary workers and immigrants of colour \u2013 all groups who face higher barriers to integration. \u201cParc-Ex was sort of an anomaly,\u201d says Rachel Shugart, a Parc-Ex resident and former program director of the Welcome Collective, a nonprofit group that helps refugee claimants through their first few months in Montreal. \u201cThe apartments that are available for the poorest, most vulnerable families are only low-price, despite their central position, despite their walkability, because the buildings are in such bad shape. They\u2019re really terrible apartments, and nobody else would take them if they had any other options.\u201d In 2011, the city\u2019s public health department found that 25.9% of Parc-Ex families with young children were living in housing infested with cockroaches. Bugs, mice, rats, mould and other problems are common, and the city has launched a campaign to send more inspectors after neglectful landlords. But while Montreal had until now avoided the worst of the housing inflation that has seized other large Canadian cities, thanks in part to generous tenant laws that cap rent increases and restrict evictions, times are changing. Property prices are rising, putting additional pressure on Parc-Ex. \u201cThe real estate market has been gaining momentum for a dozen years, but in the past two years, it\u2019s been disproportionate,\u201d says Faiz Abhuani. Abuhani runs Brick by Brick, which raises community bonds to purchase properties and turn them into affordable housing in Parc-Ex. The spike in prices, he says, has dashed his hopes of making deals any time soon. Now, the Mil project is bringing that pressure directly into the heart of Parc-Ex. There are no official statistics on rent increases or evictions, but Cape says it helped close to 500 tenants in the first half of 2019. Of those, 21 were being pushed out illegally and 16 had been pressured to leave. Since last year there has been \u201ca significant increase in the number of people coming to see us for questions relating to rent increases, repossessions, and major renovations,\u201d says Cape\u2019s Amy Darwish. The tension is also being ratcheted up by Montreal\u2019s long-time effort to create jobs and raise the tax base by attracting the tech, creative and knowledge industries. Mile End quickly gentrified after Ubisoft moved in, aided by tax credits. As Mil opens there is also a push to attract AI companies to the Marconi-Alexandra area where the University of Montreal\u2019s Mila research centre is located, as well as companies such as Element AI; in September Microsoft will move into a new research lab a short walk away from Mil. Mil itself represents a \u201cquick fix\u201d for the city to raise revenue, says Norma Rantisi, professor in the geography, planning and environment department at Montreal\u2019s Concordia University. \u201cWhat this Montreal campus represents is a heavily publicly subsidised institution that\u2019s serving the commercialisation of knowledge in ways that are supporting private sector endeavours,\u201d she says, \u201cbut at the same time putting at risk a lot of the lower-income residents and lower-income establishments.\u201d Critics say the university should be paying more attention to its immediate impact on the neighbourhoods where it is located. Research has shown that large institutions can leverage their economic power to spur inclusive growth in surrounding communities. The University of Toronto has launched an Anchor Strategy for its campus in Scarborough, one of Canada\u2019s most multicultural areas, which includes reforming its procurement process to bring in more diverse and local enterprises on campus, and increasing employment and training opportunities for nearby residents. Drexel University in Philadelphia, US, found that its Hire Local initiative led to decreased turnover rates among staff. By contrast, O\u2019Meara says the University of Montreal hiring process is regulated by collective agreements that prevent it from setting jobs aside for workers from specific parts of the city. \u201cThat\u2019s the way campuses used to be built half a century ago,\u201d says Ted Howard of the Democracy Collaborative, which researches the issue. \u201cIf the University of Montreal wants to be a world-class, renown[ed] institution, it can\u2019t simply rely on its teaching and its research, and the intellectual aspect of the institution, as important as that is. It has got to take account of the kind of neighbour it is, and how it uses its economic strength to creatively help solve problems in the community where it\u2019s going to be based.\u201d The University of Montreal says it was careful to plan for negative impacts the Mil campus may have. O\u2019Meara says that of the 1,300 new housing units planned, 15% will match affordability guidelines and another 15% will be social housing. There will be new bike lanes and parks, all made accessible by the new footbridge. The campus is aiming for a LEED for Neighborhood Development (LEED ND) certification, which rates urban projects on the basis of environmental sustainability, and a portion of the new land was made temporarily available to community gardens while construction unfolds. A mobile health clinic was set up for low-income children in Parc-Ex. But none of the housing is reserved for current Parc-Ex residents, and it is unclear when any of it will be built; the roughly 1,000 households in Parc-Ex on a waiting list for social housing will not get first rights on the new Mil units. \u201cThe arrival of the University of Montreal has created havoc,\u201d says one resident who has lived in Parc-Ex for 28 years. \u201cMost people here are immigrants, they earn the minimum wage, some are on welfare. If the University of Montreal brings improvements, they won\u2019t benefit those people. We\u2019ve seen it happen in other neighbourhoods.\u201d Concerns about the project\u2019s ability to integrate seamlessly with surrounding neighbourhoods were voiced early on. The former dean of the architecture school, Jean-Claude Marsan, argued for the university to densify its existing campus rather than build a second one, out of fears the new campus wouldn\u2019t be economically viable. In 2006 Montreal\u2019s other French-speaking university, UQAM, barely escaped bankruptcy when funds for its own new science campus and student housing project were mismanaged. Undeterred, the University of Montreal launched a vast public consultation of residents and community actors. That process and statements from university representatives led the community to believe that decisions would be made transparently, says Gonzalo Lizarralde, a professor in the university\u2019s architecture school, but in the end most decisions were made behind closed doors, he says. \u201cA lot of expectations were created, for instance on the integration of the two neighbourhoods, on the revitalisation of Parc-Extension, on the improvements for residents.

And it shouldn\u2019t teach Trudeau only how incredibly unacceptable and upsetting blackface is. </p> <p>The first big takeaway is that, contrary to popular liberal opinion, the right cares deeply about racism. It has been wonderful to see Andrew Scheer, the Canadian Conservative leader, take this so seriously and insist, with no ulterior motives whatsoever, that Trudeau \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/07/justin-trudeau-says-erosion-of-trust-at-centre-of-political-scandal\" title=\"\">has lost the moral authority to govern</a>\u201d. It has been heartwarming to watch the likes of Tomi Lahren, a Fox News commentator who has been described as a \u201cwhite power Barbie\u201d, decry Trudeau\u2019s transgressions and <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/trudeau-blackface-media-double-standard-tomi-lahren\" title=\"\">insist he take proper responsibility</a>. \u201cDude, you were almost 30 years old \u2026 you should have known better,\u201d she said in response to his lacklustre apology. This is the same woman, by the way, who once called Black Lives Matter \u201cthe new KKK\u201d.</p> <p>The right gets incredibly worked up about social justice issues when there is an opportunity to use them for political gain. Just look at the bad-faith way in which US Republicans have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/06/ilhan-omar-weaponisation-of-anti-semitism\" title=\"\">weaponised antisemitism to attack Ilhan Omar</a> and curtail criticism of the Israeli government, while ignoring or even stoking antisemitism in their own ranks. Look at how outraged about sexual harassment Donald Trump got when the person accused of it was the <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/17/selective-outrage-trump-criticizes-franken-silent-on-moore.html\" title=\"\">Democratic </a><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/17/selective-outrage-trump-criticizes-franken-silent-on-moore.html\" title=\"\">senator Al Franken</a>. You almost have to admire the right for being so shamelessly hypocritical.</p> <p>Progressives must get better at calling out double standards instead of constantly being manipulated by them. However, we must take a critical look at selective outrage in liberal circles, too. Trudeau\u2019s blackface photos are awful; there is no way you could look away from them. But there has been a lot of looking away by some progressives regarding Trudeau\u2019s problematic policies and less in-your-face bigotry. Trudeau has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/21/justin-trudeau-defends-canada-arms-sales-to-saudi-arabia\" title=\"\">defended arms sales to Saudi Arabia</a>, one of the world\u2019s worst human rights violators. He has approved an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/18/canada-trans-mountain-pipeline-expansion-approved-trudeau\" title=\"\">oil pipeline expansion opposed by many environmental and Indigenous groups</a>. He has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/28/justin-trudeau-indigenous-activist-apology-thank-you-donation\" title=\"\">publicly belittled </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/28/justin-trudeau-indigenous-activist-apology-thank-you-donation\" title=\"\">Indigenous activists</a>. He has <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/8/15/20806133/justin-trudeau-snc-lavalin-ethics-report-canada-elections\" title=\"\">violated ethics laws</a>. He has avoided questions about whether a Liberal government would comply with a human rights tribunal ruling <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/trudeau-town-hall-child-welfare-1.5292200\" title=\"\">ordering compensation for First Nations children</a>.</p> <p>Trudeau is no monster; he has spent the past few years upholding refugee rights in Canada and should be commended for it. But he has also spent years basking in a progressive image he doesn\u2019t deserve. For too long, too many people have given him too many passes, preferring to focus on his feelgood soundbites rather than interrogate his less-than-feelgood actions. But the current controversy has made the poster boy of progressivism\u2019s ugly side impossible to ignore. </p> <p>\u2022Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist</p>",

It has been heartwarming to watch the likes of Tomi Lahren, a Fox News commentator who has been described as a \u201cwhite power Barbie\u201d, decry Trudeau\u2019s transgressions and insist he take proper responsibility. \u201cDude, you were almost 30 years old \u2026 you should have known better,\u201d she said in response to his lacklustre apology. This is the same woman, by the way, who once called Black Lives Matter \u201cthe new KKK\u201d. The right gets incredibly worked up about social justice issues when there is an opportunity to use them for political gain. Just look at the bad-faith way in which US Republicans have weaponised antisemitism to attack Ilhan Omar and curtail criticism of the Israeli government, while ignoring or even stoking antisemitism in their own ranks. Look at how outraged about sexual harassment Donald Trump got when the person accused of it was the Democratic senator Al Franken. You almost have to admire the right for being so shamelessly hypocritical. Progressives must get better at calling out double standards instead of constantly being manipulated by them. However, we must take a critical look at selective outrage in liberal circles, too. Trudeau\u2019s blackface photos are awful; there is no way you could look away from them. But there has been a lot of looking away by some progressives regarding Trudeau\u2019s problematic policies and less in-your-face bigotry. Trudeau has defended arms sales to Saudi Arabia, one of the world\u2019s worst human rights violators. He has approved an oil pipeline expansion opposed by many environmental and Indigenous groups. He has publicly belittled Indigenous activists. He has violated ethics laws. He has avoided questions about whether a Liberal government would comply with a human rights tribunal ruling ordering compensation for First Nations children. Trudeau is no monster; he has spent the past few years upholding refugee rights in Canada and should be commended for it. But he has also spent years basking in a progressive image he doesn\u2019t deserve. For too long, too many people have given him too many passes, preferring to focus on his feelgood soundbites rather than interrogate his less-than-feelgood actions. But the current controversy has made the poster boy of progressivism\u2019s ugly side impossible to ignore. \u2022Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist",

First, if you\u2019ll allow me to point out the obvious, Trudeau is the only person in makeup! The other partygoers who are pictured are barely costumed, yet Trudeau looks like he just walked out of an old Tintin comic book as the stereotypical Arab villain.</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t end there. The makeup that Trudeau is wearing in the photos is not limited to his face but is liberally applied across his breastbone and completely covers his hands. Imagine how much thought and action (and make up!) must have gone into planning and painting young Justin Trudeau brown.</p> <p>Third, Justin Trudeau wasn\u2019t young! He was 29-years-old at the time of this party. Like the rest of us mortals (his image in the US notwithstanding), Trudeau is bound to the rules of space and time, which means that, when this party was thrown, Trudeau was not acting in some minstrel show in the American south in 1901. On the contrary, he was 29 years-old, in Vancouver, and living in the year 2001. By 2001, minstrelsy was already recognized as socially unacceptable behavior.</p> <p>Fourth, Justin Trudeau seems to have a blackface/brownface problem, with earlier examples now coming to light. The now world-famous and debonair Canadian politician has, on at least two occasions, been recorded in blackface, surely disappointing legions of his fans across the globe. Just think about it. While so people in the US seem <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/26/melania-trump-trudeau-photo-memes-g7\">ready</a> to believe that Melania or Ivanka (or both) are ready to ditch Trump and hitch a universal-health-care ride to Trudeau-land due to the young leader\u2019s good looks and suave manners, Trudeau seems to want to play out some deep-level desire to leave his whiteness behind and become\u2026an Arab.</p> <p>Justin Trudeau wants to be me.</p> <p>I\u2019m joking, of course, to make a point. I doubt Trudeau wants to be an Arab man or a black man or an Indian man, though he has dressed up as all three. But what such racial pantomimes do is exaggerate the distance between white people and non-white people for the amusement of the dominant culture. Nothing underlines whiteness more than a white person temporarily and exaggeratedly leaving whiteness behind and acting like a person of some other race.</p> <p>Why? Because racial pantomimes are not really about costumes or humor but are about power, the power to degrade the people of another race, the power to ridicule the manners of another ethnicity, and the power to make racism look like it\u2019s all just good fun.</p> <p>Nor is this kind of racism limited to the politicians in Canada. I grew up in Canada (I hold both American and Canadian citizenship) and what I see in these photos feels personal. I remember very clearly the bullying and taunts that the few non-white kids, myself included, routinely faced in school. As a Muslim kid, I was forced to leave my elementary school classroom and wait in the hall while the Lord\u2019s Prayer was read aloud over the school speakers. As a brown kid, I was constantly told by other kids that I was dirty because my knees and elbows were a darker color than the rest of my skin. In my high-school gym\u2019s locker room, I was regularly ridiculed and beaten because I was a \u201cPaki,\u201d and any brown kid in Canada when I was growing up was pejoratively called a \u201cPaki.\u201d My feeble response at the time was to tell my attackers: \u201cI\u2019m not from Pakistan.\u201d That would sometimes elicit a pause. Then a chuckle. Then the beating would continue.</p> <p>Now, it\u2019s true that things have improved in Canada since I was growing up in the 1970s and 80s, but it\u2019s also true that Canadians still aren\u2019t all that good at confronting their own racisms. This is partly because the American behemoth to the south had for a long time convinced many Canadians that racism was limited to the anti-black bigotry of the American variety. Today, many Americans (and a few Canadians) still believe the myth of a non-racist Canada. But Canadian racism is real, and it\u2019s still as pernicious, systemic and psychologically damaging as any other. Indigenous communities in particular are still forced to battle Canadian racism in the most profound ways conceivable. And until there is a real movement to confront and eliminate it in all of its varieties, racism will live on in Canada and these incidents and injustices will keep occurring.</p> <p>The immediate question in front of us is what Canadians should do today. Trudeau and his Liberal Party are now in the final weeks of a re-election campaign, and the main challenger, the Conservative Party, headed by Andrew Scheer, is already exploiting the scandal. Scheer has called Trudeau \u201cnot fit\u201d to be prime minister. But just days earlier, Scheer was <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/8xw8eb/andrew-scheer-had-a-very-bad-weekend\">excusing</a> the rampant and excessive racism and homophobia found among members of his own party. And while the Liberals have disappointed indigenous communities on several fronts since assuming power, the Conservatives haven\u2019t even offered an indigenous policy or strategy.</p> <p>Which leads us to the clear answer. Justin Trudeau\u2019s racist pantomimes are reprehensible. But let\u2019s make sure that what we are examining is not only Trudeau but also Canada and its racism. Otherwise, the solutions we come up with will be not even skin deep but simply made-up.</p> <ul> <li><p>Moustafa Bayoumi is the author of the award-winning books How Does It Feel To Be a Problem?: Being Young and Arab in America and This Muslim American Life: Dispatches from the War on Terror.

Greta Thunberg and school students lead worldwide protest Students and adults across America are joining a worldwide day of protest over the climate crisis on Friday, with strikes planned at more than 1,000 schools and workplaces in the US, the country\u2019s largest ever mass climate demonstration. The global movement\u2019s young figurehead, Greta Thunberg, will speak at a march in New York. The Guardian\u2019s view: her message is simple and unignorable. In case you\u2019re still not convinced, here is the climate crisis explained in 10 charts \u2013 and here\u2019s how you can get involved. Global health. The climate crisis is the biggest threat to global health over the next quarter-century, and governments are failing to prepare, according to a survey of the top medics who make up the membership of Britain\u2019s Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. Waterfront woes. New York City is taking action to protect the Lower Manhattan waterfront from the looming impact of climate change. But low-income residents who live by the water in other boroughs will have to fend for themselves, as Emily Nonko reports. US and Canada have lost one in four birds since 1970 The US and Canada have lost more than one in four of their birds \u2013 3 billion animals in total \u2013 since 1970, a \u201cwidespread ecological crisis\u201d outlined by scientists from both countries in a new study.

The study, published in the journal Science, did not identify a specific reason for the decline, but bird populations and their habitats are thought to have been harmed by agriculture, urbanisation, climate change and cats. Whistleblower rumours focus on Ukraine amid Giuliani claims A whistleblower complaint submitted by a US intelligence official, who was unusually troubled by a promise Donald Trump had made to a foreign leader in a phone call, was connected to Ukraine, according to reports in the Washington Post and New York Times. The foreign leader in question has not been identified, but the complaint was reportedly filed weeks before Trump spoke to the new Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Digging for dirt. Speaking to CNN on Thursday, the president\u2019s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, admitted asking Ukraine to investigate the former vice-president and 2020 presidential hopeful, Joe Biden, whose son once had a role in a Ukrainian gas company. Iran rhetoric. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has dialled down the administration\u2019s aggressive rhetoric in the wake of the recent attack on a Saudi oil facility, saying Washington wants a \u201cpeaceful resolution\u201d with Iran, whom it blames for the attack. Trudeau \u2018can\u2019t recall\u2019 how many times he wore blackface Justin Trudeau has admitted he is \u201cwary of being definitive\u201d about the number of times he donned blackface as a young man, as the Canadian prime minister fights for his political life following the emergence of three separate, historical images of him wearing the racist makeup.

Cheat sheet Two people have died and at least 1,000 needed rescuing after the remnants of Tropical Storm Imelda brought an estimated 40in of rain to parts of Texas in less than 72 hours, making it the seventh-wettest tropical cyclone in US history. The Los Angeles political activist and Democratic donor Ed Buck had at least 10 victims and preyed on gay, black homeless men, forcibly injecting them with fatal doses of drugs, according to court records released after his arrest this week. A study suggests the mystery illness known as Havana syndrome, which afflicted US and Canadian diplomats in Cuba between 2016 and 2018, may have been caused by mosquito fumigation \u2013 and not, as the Trump administration claimed, by \u201csonic attacks\u201d. Grassroots progressive organisers in partnership with the Guardian will on Saturday host their first \u201cpeople\u2019s forum\u201d in Iowa, featuring Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and several other Democratic 2020 candidates \u2013 though not the frontrunner, Joe Biden.

On Thursday, new video emerged of a third instance of Trudeau in blackface \u2013 just hours after he had apologized for wearing what he described as \u201cracist\u201d makeup to a costume party in 2001.

A spokesman for the prime minister said he had spent the morning calling Liberal candidates and community leaders to fully apologize for what he did \u201cknowing how racist and hurtful this type of thing was\u201d. The scandal erupted late on Wednesday, when Time magazine published an image of Trudeau dressed as Aladdin \u2013 complete with dark skin makeup and a turban \u2013 at a 2001 function at a private school where he was then working as a 29-year-old teacher. Trudeau immediately apologized, and acknowledged that he had previously blacked up at a high school talent show, when he had sung Day-O, the traditional Jamaican song. \u201cI apologise profoundly,\u201d Trudeau told reporters aboard his campaign plane. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was racist at the time, but now I see, it was a racist thing to do. \u201cI\u2019m pissed off at myself.

          "bodyText": "Ministers from across the Commonwealth are meeting in Kenya this week to discuss ways to accelerate efforts to end gender inequality. Gender and women\u2019s affairs ministers from 53 states will explore the gains and the gaping holes in progress in several key areas, including women in leadership, ending violence and increasing access to family planning services. In June, a global report found that no country in the world was on track to achieve gender equality by the UN-agreed 2030 deadline. Decisions from the two-day meeting, which begins in Nairobi on Thursday, will feed into a wider Commonwealth strategy designed to end inequality and meet the 17 UN sustainable development goals (SDGs). The strategy will be adopted at the Commonwealth heads of government meeting next year. The secretary general of the Commonwealth, Lady Patricia Scotland, said this week\u2019s meeting offered \u201can immensely valuable opportunity for our member countries collectively to monitor and evaluate progress towards achieving Commonwealth priorities\u201d. The Commonwealth\u2019s annual report on gender equality, expected to be published later this year, shows existing efforts are not effecting significant, lasting change. Despite improvements in maternal health, primary education and women\u2019s participation in the labour force in Commonwealth states, there is still a dearth of women in political leadership. Only Rwanda has achieved gender parity in its parliament, with women making up more than 60% of MPs in the lower house. Just 12 other Commonwealth countries have parliaments where more than 30% of MPs are women. Despite a greater presence in the workforce, women remain more likely than men to work in the informal sector, while huge gaps endure between the prevalence of gender-based violence across Commonwealth countries and the initiatives in place to tackle such abuse.

The incident comes as Trudeau is locked in a fight to maintain his parliamentary majority. Canadians vote on 21 October, in what many expect to be a tight race. Polling suggests Trudeau and Scheer are deadlocked in the popular vote, but that the Liberals hold an edge when it comes to winning seats in parliament. The election will be fought against the backdrop of a protracted political scandal for the incumbent prime minister, with accusations \u2013 including from the country\u2019s ethics commissioner \u2013 that Trudeau acted improperly when he requested his attorney general to halt criminal prosecution of the Quebec-based engineering giant SNC Lavalin. After his election in 2015, Trudeau was hailed for naming a young and ethnically-diverse cabinet, with a ministerial team that for the first time in the country\u2019s history was equally balanced between men and women. His cabinet included Maryam Monsef, who fled Afghanistan as a refugee 20 years ago and will oversee the democratic reform portfolio, as well as two Indigenous members of parliament and three Sikh politicians. \u201cIt\u2019s important to be here before you today to present to Canada a cabinet that looks like Canada,\u201d Trudeau said after he was sworn in. However, the Canadian leader has also been criticised for his treatment of Indigenous peoples, particularly in relation to the Trans Mountain pipeline project that the Liberal government has supported despite environmental and Indigenous groups fiercely opposing the project. It is unclear how the image will impact the prime minister, who has cultivated a tightly-controlled social media image. When asked by reporters if he would eject a member of his own party for a similar image, he said he wouldn\u2019t entertain \u201chypotheticals\u201d and that each incident would be viewed on a \u201ccase-by-case basis\u201d.

This level of access is appropriate given the positions he held.\u201d</p> <p>Lucki did not say which foreign organisations may have been exposed by Ortis, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/canada\">Canada</a> \u2013 alongside the United States, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Australia \u2013 is part of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance.</p> <p>Ortis faces five charges under Canada\u2019s Security of Information Act, as well as the two under the Criminal Code, all in relation to alleged incidents that occurred between 2015 and 2019.</p> <p>The charges show that Ortis is accused of communicating covert operational information in 2015. He also faces charges of sharing secret information with a terrorist group or foreign entity \u2013 but it remains unclear if he had interacted with a state or individual.</p> <p>\u201cWe are aware of the potential risk to agency operations of our partners in Canada and abroad and we thank them for their continued collaboration,\u201d Lucki said.</p> <p>\u201cWe assure you that mitigation strategies are being put in place as required.\u201d</p> <p>Lucki would not confirm, but did not deny, reports Canadian authorities were led to Ortis while investigating Ramos, saying only the RCMP was working with the FBI in 2018 when they \u201ccame across certain documents that led us to believe that there might be some internal corruption\u201d.</p> <p>The RCMP, FBI, Australian federal police and other law enforcement agencies were involved in the probe of Ramos.</p> <p>Ramos\u2019s Phantom Secure phones \u2013 promoted as \u201cuncrackable\u201d \u2013 were used by criminal syndicates around the world. At his trial, a San Diego court was told US, Australian and Canadian authorities could not find one Phantom Secure customer who was not a criminal.</p> <p>Ramos sold Phantom Secure devices to Owen Hanson, the kingpin who created the drug trafficking network ODOG, that shipped massive quantities of cocaine to Australia. Hanson was sentenced in 2017 to 21 years in prison.</p> <p>The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, citing an assessment by Canada\u2019s Communications Security Establishment cybersecurity agency, reported Ortis had allegedly reached out to Ramos.</p> <p>\u201cI have information that I am confident you will find very valuable,\u201d one email from Ortis to Ramos allegedly said, according to the CSE documents.</p> <p>Lucki conceded intelligence agencies around the world had been \u201cshaken\u201d by Ortis\u2019s arrest and that the allegations were \u201cextremely unsettling\u201d.</p> <p>Lucki said no Canadian ally had made any moves to limit or suspend intelligence-sharing with Canada but conceded there was \u201calways the possibility\u201d that partner agencies might lose trust in the RCMP.</p> <p>\u201cI would definitely imagine that there is concern amongst our Five Eyes community as well as within Canada,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Andrew Little, the minister responsible for the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service and Government Communications Security Bureau, said he had been made aware of the charges and that he \u201cexpected to be kept informed of developments in the ongoing investigation\u201d.</p> <p>The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and the Department of Home Affairs both refused to comment.</p> <p><em>With AAP</em></p>",

He had access to classified information from Canada\u2019s Five Eyes global allies, including Australia. It has been reported Canadian authorities were led to Ortis\u2019s alleged corruption while investigating Vincent Ramos, the Vancouver-based head of encrypted phone company Phantom Secure, used by drug-trafficking networks. Ramos was a significant player in the Australian criminal underworld. The FBI estimated that of the 20,000 Phantom Secure devices in service around the world, 10,000 were used by Australian criminals. In May, Ramos was jailed for nine years in a San Diego court for \u201cleading a criminal enterprise that facilitated the transnational importation and distribution of narcotics through the sale of encrypted communication devices and services\u201d. As global intelligence agencies reeled from the revelation of Ortis\u2019s arrest, the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, sought to reassure allies that Canada was treating the leak \u2013 said to be the largest of secret information in Canadian history \u2013 \u201cvery seriously\u201d. \u201cWe are in direct communications with our allies on security,\u201d Trudeau said while campaigning for re-election. \u201cWe are also working with them to reassure them, but we want to ensure that everyone understands that we are taking this situation very seriously.\u201d The commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Brenda Lucki, said Ortis had access to highly classified information by virtue of his senior position in the force. \u201cHe also had access to intelligence coming from our allies both domestically and internationally. This level of access is appropriate given the positions he held.\u201d Lucki did not say which foreign organisations may have been exposed by Ortis, but Canada \u2013 alongside the United States, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Australia \u2013 is part of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance. Ortis faces five charges under Canada\u2019s Security of Information Act, as well as the two under the Criminal Code, all in relation to alleged incidents that occurred between 2015 and 2019. The charges show that Ortis is accused of communicating covert operational information in 2015. He also faces charges of sharing secret information with a terrorist group or foreign entity \u2013 but it remains unclear if he had interacted with a state or individual. \u201cWe are aware of the potential risk to agency operations of our partners in Canada and abroad and we thank them for their continued collaboration,\u201d Lucki said. \u201cWe assure you that mitigation strategies are being put in place as required.\u201d Lucki would not confirm, but did not deny, reports Canadian authorities were led to Ortis while investigating Ramos, saying only the RCMP was working with the FBI in 2018 when they \u201ccame across certain documents that led us to believe that there might be some internal corruption\u201d. The RCMP, FBI, Australian federal police and other law enforcement agencies were involved in the probe of Ramos. Ramos\u2019s Phantom Secure phones \u2013 promoted as \u201cuncrackable\u201d \u2013 were used by criminal syndicates around the world. At his trial, a San Diego court was told US, Australian and Canadian authorities could not find one Phantom Secure customer who was not a criminal. Ramos sold Phantom Secure devices to Owen Hanson, the kingpin who created the drug trafficking network ODOG, that shipped massive quantities of cocaine to Australia. Hanson was sentenced in 2017 to 21 years in prison. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, citing an assessment by Canada\u2019s Communications Security Establishment cybersecurity agency, reported Ortis had allegedly reached out to Ramos. \u201cI have information that I am confident you will find very valuable,\u201d one email from Ortis to Ramos allegedly said, according to the CSE documents. Lucki conceded intelligence agencies around the world had been \u201cshaken\u201d by Ortis\u2019s arrest and that the allegations were \u201cextremely unsettling\u201d. Lucki said no Canadian ally had made any moves to limit or suspend intelligence-sharing with Canada but conceded there was \u201calways the possibility\u201d that partner agencies might lose trust in the RCMP. \u201cI would definitely imagine that there is concern amongst our Five Eyes community as well as within Canada,\u201d she said. Andrew Little, the minister responsible for the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service and Government Communications Security Bureau, said he had been made aware of the charges and that he \u201cexpected to be kept informed of developments in the ongoing investigation\u201d. The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and the Department of Home Affairs both refused to comment. With AAP",

In a series of internal documents obtained by the CBC, Canada\u2019s intelligence service outlined fears that details of the country\u2019s spycraft could have been comprised after the theft of sensitive information by Cameron Ortis, 47, a director general with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police\u2019s intelligence unit. \u201cThis type of information is among the most highly protected of national security assets, by any government standard and goes to the heart of Canada\u2019s sovereignty and security,\u201d the documents read.

A clearer picture has also emerged of the internal RCMP investigation \u2013 dubbed Project Ace \u2013 that led police to arrest Ortis, the highest-ranking civilian in the organization. The search for the mole began after US police arrested Canadian citizen Vincent Ramos, the CEO of a Vancouver company which sold modified Blackberry devices to organized crime rings, including the Sinaloa drug cartel.

Here are some of the night\u2019s key takeaways:</p> \n  <ol> \n   <li><strong>Joe Biden </strong>turned in an overall solid performance that was a far cry from his disastrous first debate. But the former vice president\u2019s reference to \u201crecord player\u201d prompted, along with many Twitter jokes, yet another moment of, \u201cWhat is he talking about?\u201d And the debate\u2019s most divisive moment came when <strong>Juli\u00e1n Castro </strong>accused Biden of flip-flopping on healthcare by repeatedly asking him, \u201cAre you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?\u201d Castro later denied the remark was an attack on Biden\u2019s age, but the question elicited gasps from the audience and immediately recalled Biden\u2019s repeated gaffes in recent weeks. He has, for example, mixed up the locations of recent mass shootings and misidentified the state he was campaigning in. (But it later appeared Castro had <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ABCWorldNews/status/1172345537598615552\">mischaracterized</a> Biden\u2019s original comments.)<br></li> \n   <li>The biggest question going into the debate was whether Biden and <strong>Elizabeth Warren</strong>, two front-runners who were meeting on a debate stage for the first time, would go after each other. The answer turned out to be: not really. With the exception of Biden\u2019s fumbled reference to \u201cthe senator to my left\u201d at the beginning of the debate, the pair focused on defending their proposals more than anything else. Meanwhile, the other top-polling candidate, <strong>B</strong><strong>ernie Sanders, </strong>successfully inserted himself into many of the night\u2019s most policy-driven discussions on healthcare and foreign policy.</li> \n   <li>The narrowed debate field undeniably changed the dynamics of the event. Without the 10 additional candidates spread across two nights, there appeared to be fewer desperate attempts for attention and more calls to unify as one Democratic field. That suggestion didn\u2019t sit well with Castro, who told <strong>Pete Buttigeg </strong>at one point, \u201cThat\u2019s called an election.\u201d </li> \n   <li>Of the lower-polling candidates, <strong>Beto O\u2019Rourke </strong>appeared to have the most standout moments. His answers about gun control, coming just a month after the mass shooting in his hometown of El Paso, attracted enthusiastic applause from the audience, and O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign said it had the best hour of fundraising this quarter during the debate.</li> \n   <li>One clear winner of tonight\u2019s debate: <strong>Barack Obama. </strong>Candidates like <strong>Kamala Harris </strong>and Castro started several answers by applauding the work done by the former president\u2019s administration \u2013 which was quite a contrast from the second debate, after which Biden complained that some of his opponents were disparaging Obama\u2019s robust legacy.<br></li> \n  </ol> \n  <p>That\u2019s it from me on this debate night.

The last time a Democrat was elected statewide in Texas was 1994. <br></p> \n  <p>Down ballot, Democrats flipped two congressional seats in the state and made major gains at the local level, sweeping Harris County and picking up House and Senate seats. <br></p> \n  <p>The party is gaining traction in the once-reliably Republican suburbs, where college-educated voters and particularly women recoiled from Trump as well as from an expanding Latino electorate that trends overwhelmingly Democratic. <br></p> \n  <p>Five Republican members of Congress from Texas have announced their retirement in recent weeks, a trend Democrats have gleefully dubbed the \u201cTexodus\u201d. They say the Republican departures are indicative of Democrats growing strength in the state. Not all the congressional districts are competitive - but it is a sign that their hope of recapturing the House is increasingly unlikely. House Speaker <strong>Nancy Pelos</strong><strong>i</strong> has said she considers Texas \u201cground zero for us next election\u201d. <br></p> \n  <p>Two Texans are running for president: O\u2019Rourke and <strong>Juli\u00e1n Castro</strong>. Both have suggested that Texas\u2019s electoral treasure chest would be up for grabs if they were on the ticket.</p> \n  <p>But demographic shifts won\u2019t happen overnight and the odds remain long that the state will turn the state blue in 2020. <br></p> \n  <p>Still, Democrats are poised to make some gains \u2013 and if everything\u2019s bigger in Texas, the political fight here will be one to watch. <br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-09-12T23:34:58.268Z\">at 12.34am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d7ad1868f082514879f32d8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-12T23:16:35.777Z\">12.16am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>We may have an answer to what big, unprecedented surprise <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2019/sep/12/debate-democratic-2019-live-latest-news-biden-bernie-sanders-elizabeth-warren-yang-2019-updates?page=with:block-5d7ac8bf8f08143ee1ae5542#block-5d7ac8bf8f08143ee1ae5542\">Andrew Yang</a> </strong>will reveal at tonight\u2019s debate, and it is ... rather underwhelming.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/rubycramer/status/1172286221822902275\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Earlier this week, Yang's campaign promised he\u2019ll do something that\u2019s never been seen before at the debate.<br><br>Tonight, the answer: Yang will announce a contest where 10 people will get his proposed Freedom Dividend of $1K a month for one year, according to a senior adviser.</p>\u2014 Ruby Cramer (@rubycramer) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rubycramer/status/1172286221822902275?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 12, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d7acf568f08143ee1ae555b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-09-12T23:13:09.373Z\">12.13am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>But the Democratic presidential candidates who missed the debate stage this time around \u2013 including <strong>Steve Bullock, Tom Steyer </strong>and <strong>Tim Ryan</strong>\u2013 are showing no signs of calling it quits.</p> \n  <p>Bullock, the Montana governor, offered this oh-so-subtle Twitter message earlier today:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GovernorBullock/status/1172178986970931201\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">See you in Iowa today, and over the next 143 days!</p>\u2014 Steve Bullock (@GovernorBullock) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GovernorBullock/status/1172178986970931201?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 12, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>And Ryan and Steyer are holding events in the early voting states of New Hampshire and Iowa.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TaheraTV/status/1172270179767783426\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Media is all set up and ready to go for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TomSteyer?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@TomSteyer</a> here at Davenport\u2019s River Center. <a href=\"https://t.co/lJFwKgttPt\">pic.twitter.com/lJFwKgttPt</a></p>\u2014 Tahera Rahman (@TaheraTV) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TaheraTV/status/1172270179767783426?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 12, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TimRyan/status/1172284321362845697\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">While many eyes will be on the stage in Houston tonight, I'm doing things the old-fashioned way\u2014talking with voters directly.

          "bodyText": "It was a long night that frequently dove into the weeds of candidates\u2019 specific proposals with a couple explosive moments thrown in along the way. Here are some of the night\u2019s key takeaways: Joe Biden turned in an overall solid performance that was a far cry from his disastrous first debate. But the former vice president\u2019s reference to \u201crecord player\u201d prompted, along with many Twitter jokes, yet another moment of, \u201cWhat is he talking about?\u201d And the debate\u2019s most divisive moment came when Juli\u00e1n Castro accused Biden of flip-flopping on healthcare by repeatedly asking him, \u201cAre you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?\u201d Castro later denied the remark was an attack on Biden\u2019s age, but the question elicited gasps from the audience and immediately recalled Biden\u2019s repeated gaffes in recent weeks. He has, for example, mixed up the locations of recent mass shootings and misidentified the state he was campaigning in. (But it later appeared Castro had mischaracterized Biden\u2019s original comments.) The biggest question going into the debate was whether Biden and Elizabeth Warren, two front-runners who were meeting on a debate stage for the first time, would go after each other. The answer turned out to be: not really. With the exception of Biden\u2019s fumbled reference to \u201cthe senator to my left\u201d at the beginning of the debate, the pair focused on defending their proposals more than anything else. Meanwhile, the other top-polling candidate, Bernie Sanders, successfully inserted himself into many of the night\u2019s most policy-driven discussions on healthcare and foreign policy. The narrowed debate field undeniably changed the dynamics of the event. Without the 10 additional candidates spread across two nights, there appeared to be fewer desperate attempts for attention and more calls to unify as one Democratic field. That suggestion didn\u2019t sit well with Castro, who told Pete Buttigeg at one point, \u201cThat\u2019s called an election.\u201d Of the lower-polling candidates, Beto O\u2019Rourke appeared to have the most standout moments. His answers about gun control, coming just a month after the mass shooting in his hometown of El Paso, attracted enthusiastic applause from the audience, and O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign said it had the best hour of fundraising this quarter during the debate. One clear winner of tonight\u2019s debate: Barack Obama. Candidates like Kamala Harris and Castro started several answers by applauding the work done by the former president\u2019s administration \u2013 which was quite a contrast from the second debate, after which Biden complained that some of his opponents were disparaging Obama\u2019s robust legacy. That\u2019s it from me on this debate night. Thanks for following along with the live blog, and be sure to read the Guardian\u2019s other coverage of the night. The question of whether Castro\u2019s attack on Biden was fair appears to be dominating the post-debate chatter, with Cory Booker becoming the latest to weigh in. Booker offered a more mild reproach than Amy Klobuchar, emphasizing that \u201ctone and tenor\u201d are important when having such conversations. But interestingly, Booker heavily implied that he has his own concerns about Biden\u2019s ability to \u201cget the ball over the line.\u201d When specially asked if he was concerned about Biden\u2019s age, Booker offered an emphatic \u201cno,\u201d but the whole answer seems to have a heavy \u201cwink and a nudge\u201d element to it. Here\u2019s an interesting take from the conservative writer Rich Lowry, editor of National Review. He suggests that all three of the Democratic frontrunners represent an electoral risk and if that he was a Democrat he\u2019d be urging the party to look elsewhere. Stacy Abrams, perhaps? Juli\u00e1n Castro claimed his attack on Joe Biden\u2019s healthcare proposals, in which he accused the former vice president of flip-flopping by sarcastically asking if he was \u201cforgetting\u201d what he had said moments before, was not a criticism of Biden\u2019s age. Castro\u2019s repeated question of whether Biden was forgetting what he had said elicited gasps from the audience, who assumed (pretty understandably) that Castro was referencing Biden\u2019s repeated gaffes in recent weeks. The former vice president has, for example, mixed up the sites of recent mass shootings and misidentified the state he was currently campaigning in. The group Sunrise Movement has issued a damning statement on tonight\u2019s debate and what they say is a failure to adequately address the climate crisis. In a statement on Twitter, they said \u201cI don\u2019t know how @DNC leaders can look themselves in the mirror tonight [...] they promised us that they would ensure this issue got the attention it deserved. Tonight their check bounced.\u201d You can read the full statement via their thread here: Pete Buttigieg\u2019s final debate answer on coming out while running for office reminded many viewers of his history-making candidacy as the first major openly gay presidential candidate. And Buttigieg\u2019s own husband applauded his \u201ccourage\u201d in discussing the experience: Here is Buttigieg\u2019s answer, which came in response to a question on the meaning of resilience, in case you missed it: Beto O\u2019Rourke is already moving to capitalize on his biggest line of the night, when he pledged to enact a mandatory buyback of assault weapons. Donald Trump was uncharacteristically silent during the debate, but that\u2019s probably because he spent the beginning of it addressing a House Republican retreat in Baltimore. That didn\u2019t stop his campaign spokesperson from mocking all the Democratic presidential candidates and calling the debate an \u201cinfomercial\u201d for Trump\u2019s re-election. The debate may be over but Joe Biden\u2019s latest gaffe is still spinning. After urging viewers to visit a non-existent website called \u201cJoe 30330\u201d at the end of the last debate, he\u2019s now told children to \u201cmake sure you have the record player on at night\u201d in response to a question about how families should spend their evenings. You can watch it here: And here\u2019s how people have responded Amy Klobuchar said she found Juli\u00e1n Castro\u2019s criticism of Joe Biden, when he appeared to criticize the former vice president\u2019s age, \u201cnot cool\u201d and compared it to a Trumpian line of attack. Most of the attention going into tonight\u2019s debate was on whether Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren would directly confront each other as they met for the first time on a debate stage. But with the exception of a somewhat haphazard effort by Biden at the beginning to criticize \u201cthe senator to my left,\u201d the two leading candidates remained focused on defending their policies more than anything else. The only candidate who directly confronted Biden was Juli\u00e1n Castro, but that effort didn\u2019t seem to land and may have even be misleading, an ABC News reporter said. Update: the demonstrators who interrupted Joe Biden during the final question of the debate appear to have been immigration protesters, according to a Daily Mail reporter. Moderator Jorge Ramos pushed Biden on the high number of deportations under the Obama administration, but the former vice president defended Obama, arguing the president had done the best he could at the time. Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s team appears to be taking a victory lap after his debate performance, which has attracted donors and plaudits. From his rapid response director: O\u2019Rourke\u2019s answers on gun control, in which he repeatedly mentioned the recent mass shooting in his hometown of El Paso, in particular attracted enthusiastic applause from the Houston crowd. The debate has concluded \u2013 about 15 minutes earlier than expected, but this blogger is not complaining. We\u2019ll have more post-debate analysis and spin as it comes in, so stay tuned. Beto O\u2019Rourke gave a stirring answer on resiliency by honoring his hometown of El Paso as it continues to heal from the mass shooting that killed 22. He referenced those who are still recovering from their injuries. Amy Klobuchar talked about pushing her state legislature to change the law on hospital stays for mothers with ill newborns after her daughter was born unable to swallow. Juli\u00e1n Castro recounted quitting his high-paying law firm job so that he could vote against a controversial land deal as a member of San Antonio\u2019s city council. A bizarre advert showing a burning photo of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has prompted outrage after playing during an earlier debate break. Paid for by the group New Faces GOP, the ad describes the progressive congresswoman as \u201cthe face of socialism\u201d while issuing a very morbid warning against the economic model. You can see the advert here: Here\u2019s how Ocasio-Cortez has responded: Many others have also expressed their alarm at the advert: Meanwhile, the debate has passed by without any question on reproductive rights, which was a central campaign plank of senator Kirsten Gillibrand. The New York senator dropped out of the race late last month. A former adviser to Gillibrand argued the oversight demonstrated the need for a candidate focused on those issues. This question of what resiliency means to each candidate has given them the chance to dive more into their personal histories. Elizabeth Warren spoke about being discriminated against as a teacher because she was pregnant. Bernie Sanders talked about repeatedly losing races and finally seeing his vision prevail with voters. Kamala Harris repeated her common line of being the first African-American woman to hold several offices and not listening to people telling her it wasn\u2019t her time. Pete Buttigieg talked about coming out as gay while running for office and learning to trust voters with that knowledge. Joe Biden was just beginning his answer on resilience when he was interrupted by a group of protesters in the Houston audience. Once the protesters were cleared out, Biden spoke about his personal tragedies, losing his wife and daughter before being sworn in as a senator and later seeing his son die from brain cancer while he was serving as vice president. A Daily Beast reporter said the optics weren\u2019t the best for the protesters. Moderator Linsey Davis, who previously asked Kamala Harris a tough question about her record on criminal justice, has now posed a similarly difficult question to Joe Biden. Davis specifically asked about Biden\u2019s 1975 comment that he didn\u2019t \u201cfeel responsible for the sins of my father and grandfather\u201d when it came to segregation. \u201cThere is institutional segregation in this country,\u201d Biden acknowledged off the bat, claiming he has worked against such discrimination from the beginning of his career. But the former senator has attracted criticism for his past opposition to government-mandated busing to racially integrate schools. When Davis tried to cut off Biden, he said he was going to blow past the time limit like all of his opponents, prompting laughter. But he then oddly segued into an answer on Venezuela, which came up about 20 minutes ago. Kamala Harris used her education answer to trumpet the importance of historically black colleges and universities, one of which she attended (Howard University in Washington). The site of tonight\u2019s debate, Texas Southern University, is also a historically black university \u2013 which may partly explain the healthy applause Harris\u2019 answer attracted. The audience was similarly receptive to Harris\u2019 citations of statistics showing that black children with black teachers are more likely to go on to college. The discussion has turned toward education. Andrew Yang was pressed about his stance toward public education, and the tech entrepreneur emphasized he was \u201cpro-good school\u201d. Pete Buttigieg emphasized teachers need to be better paid so that the positions can attract the best possible candidates. And Elizabeth Warren dismissed claims that she was \u201cin bed with the teacher unions.\u201d Warren emphasized she was the person onstage who has previously been a teacher and argued that educational funding needs to stay in public schools. Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign is trying to capitalize on his gun-control answers, which attracted some of the loudest applause of the debate so far, by spinning Elizabeth Warren\u2019s catchphrase, \u201cI\u2019ve got a plan.\u201d The first climate question has arrived two hours into the debate, much to the chagrin of environmental activists no doubt. Beto O\u2019Rourke pledged to spend $5 trillion to combat the crisis and pursue policies that may be politically unpopular. He referenced the site of the debate, Houston, which suffered devastating losses from Hurricane Harvey in 2017. The former congressman said he would pursue disaster relief grants to aid cities like Houston. After O\u2019Rourke completed his answer, many candidates wanted to offer their own plans, so Jorge Ramos said he would try to \u201cquickly\u201d get through them. That sound you hear is every climate activist banging their head against the wall. Along with the climate crisis there\u2019s another topic the candidates haven\u2019t been questioned on tonight: LGBT rights. From Trump\u2019s ban of trans people in the military to his push to allow employers to fire employees based on sexuality and gender identity, the White House\u2019s discriminatory policies have caused huge alarm. Yet so far the issue hasn\u2019t come up once in the debate. The organization Glaad has pointed this out and taken the opportunity to promote its upcoming LGBT forum for candidates. Continuing with the foreign policy discussion, Juli\u00e1n Castro argued the Trump administration should offer Temporary Protected Status to Venezuelans fleeing Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s regime. Trump\u2019s government has backed the opposition government in Venezuela but has refrained from offering TPS, even as it has struggled to oust Maduro. Bernie Sanders went after Joe Biden for voting in favor of authorizing the 2003 invasion of Iraq, with the Vermont senator boasting he \u201cnever believed\u201d George W. Bush or Dick Cheney. Biden recently acknowledged he \u201cmisspoke\u201d in an interview when he claimed he quickly came around to opposing the Iraq War. Okay, back to policy. Discussing the potential withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, Elizabeth Warren said the United States needed to stop using the military to address problems that cannot be solved militarily. Pete Buttigieg, the only veteran onstage, accused Congress of ignoring its responsibility to determine the necessity of military action. And he criticized Trump for using troops as \u201cprops.\u201d And Cory Booker just used a foreign-policy question involving Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau to make a crack about his baldness, so things are getting a little loose on the debate stage. A PBS NewsHour reporter predicted Kamala Harris\u2019 comparison of Trump to the \u201csmall dude\u201d in \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d would likely provoke a response from the president. It reminded some of Republican senator Marco Rubio\u2019s reference to Trump\u2019s \u201csmall hands\u201d during a 2016 primary debate. The candidates have been debating for about an hour and a half now, and there have so far been no questions on the climate crisis. This hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed: Kamala Harris seems determined to direct all of her criticism toward Trump after confronting Joe Biden in the first debate. Directly asked how her trade policy would differ from Barack Obama\u2019s, Harris instead immediately pivoted to saying how her policy would be different from Trump, criticizing him for navigating a trade war over Twitter. She then referenced \u201cThe Wizard of Oz.\u201d \u201cYou know, when you pull back the curtain, it\u2019s a really small dude?\u201d Harris said. Host George Stephanopoulos, who is about 5\u20195\u201d, replied in a deadpan manner, \u201cOkay. I\u2019m not going to take the bait.\u201d Here\u2019s how long each candidate has spoken so far tonight (we\u2019re now halfway through). The candidates are being asked about tariffs and whether they would repeal them on day one of their administrations. Andrew Yang said he wouldn\u2019t. Pete Buttigieg took the opportunity to criticize Trump for fumbling at a crucial moment for \u201cAmerican leadership.\u201d He referenced the president skipping a climate session at the G-7 summit. Asked again about Trump\u2019s trade policy, Buttigieg said he would use the tariffs as leverage as part of his broader strategy. (So that seems like a \u201cno\u201d on the day one question.) Here\u2019s where things stand at halftime: Candidates are directing more of their criticisms toward Trump and away from Barack Obama. Joe Biden had complained after the second debate that some of his opponents were disparaging the former president\u2019s robust legacy. Beto O\u2019Rourke attracted a lot of applause for discussing his gun policies after the mass shooting in his hometown of El Paso. Juli\u00e1n Castro has repeatedly attacked Biden, a potentially risky gamble for a lower-polling candidate. The debate has just returned from its commercial break, so here we go again. The debate has reached its first commercial break, much to the relief of your blogger. About an hour and a half down, an hour and a half to go. Juli\u00e1n Castro\u2019s repeated attacks on Joe Biden are definitely attracting the attention of political reporters, but it\u2019s very difficult to say whether the gamble will pay off. Juli\u00e1n Castro is striking a notably different tone on Barack Obama\u2019s legacy this time around. During the second debate, Castro, who served as Obama\u2019s housing and urban development secretary, argued the former president had fallen short on immigration. But tonight, Castro began his answer on immigration by emphasizing that Obama was nothing like Trump on the issue. Castro went on to argue that he was continuing the true legacy of Obama. Moderator Jorge Ramos asked Joe Biden about the high number of deportations under the Obama administration. \u201cAre you prepared to say tonight that you and President Obama made a mistake on deportations?\u201d Ramos asked. \u201cWhy should Latinos trust you?\u201d Biden initially deflected, arguing that Obama is nothing like Trump on immigration -- citing the heart-wrenching images of migrant children being held in apparent cages. When pressed by Ramos to answer the initial question, Biden said. \u201cThe president did the best thing that was able to be done.\u201d Ramos asked, \u201cWhat about you?\u201d Biden simply replied, \u201cI\u2019m the vice president of the United States.\u201d (Well, he was, but you get the idea.) Elizabeth Warren is calling for the end of the Senate filibuster to enact gun-control legislation. If the filibuster was done away with, it would only take 50 Senate votes to pass a bill; legislation can currently be blocked if it attracts less than 60 votes. Bernie Sanders said he would not end the filibuster but argued there were other legislative means to pass major legislation on issues like gun control and climate change. O\u2019Rourke did not shy away from saying he would require citizens to turn in their military-style weapons, despite Republicans\u2019 frequent accusations that Democrats are coming to take Americans\u2019 guns. \u201cHell yes, we\u2019re going to take your AK-47,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said in one of the biggest lines of the night so far. The moderators specifically turned to Beto O\u2019Rourke to answer a question on gun policy, given that his hometown just suffered a mass shooting. Discussing his policy for a mandatory buyback program for assault weapons, the former congressman received some of the biggest applause of the night. Kamala Harris took a question on gun control and also applauded Beto O\u2019Rourke for his attention to El Paso after the mass shooting there. The California senator then implicated Trump in the white nationalist shooting, saying that the president may not have pulled the trigger but has been \u201ctweeting out the ammunition.\u201d Joe Biden is taking a question on gun control and once again arguing he has the best (and certainly the longest) record on the issue. \u201cI\u2019m the only one up here who\u2019s ever beat the NRA,\u201d the former vice president and senator said. Biden then similarly applauded Beto O\u2019Rourke for his efforts to help his hometown of El Paso heal from the mass shooting that killed 22. Biden originally referred to the former congressman as \u201cBeto.\u201d He then apologized and O\u2019Rourke interjected, \u201cBeto is good.\u201d In the midst of a discussion on race and criminal justice, Ari Berman, author of Give Us the Ballot, has made this important point: Here\u2019s the tense moment Castro went after Biden over his healthcare proposals \u2013 and accused him of contradicting himself onstage. Amy Klobuchar was similarly asked about her record on criminal justice reform, demonstrating how multiple candidates (including Joe Biden) have complicated histories on the issue. Kamala Harris was asked about how her criminal justice plan does not match with the policies she pursued as San Francisco\u2019s district attorney and California\u2019s attorney general. Moderator Linsey Davis asked this searing question: \u201cWhen you had the power, why didn\u2019t you try to affect change then?\u201d The question attracted applause, and Harris thanked Davis for asking it. She went on to say her plan has been praised by criminal justice advocates and arguing she tried to affect change from the inside as a prosecutor. Harris cited certain changes she made in her past roles, but the question itself demonstrated how this is a lingering controversy hanging over her candidacy. Beto O\u2019Rourke pledged to sign a reparations bill into law as president, something that Marianne Williamson spoke of in the last debate. (But Williamson is not onstage tonight.) O\u2019Rourke also touched on the white nationalist shooting in his hometown of El Paso, prompting a compliment from Castro about how eloquently the former congressman has spoken about the violence that impacted his community. Castro went after O\u2019Rourke, his fellow Texan, in the first debate, so the compliment was noteworthy. Andrew Yang has unveiled his surprise announcement of the night to mixed reviews. During his opening remarks he told the audience his campaign is giving 10 American families $1,000 a month for a year \u2013 mirroring his plan to roll out a universal basic income scheme nationwide. His competition has been welcomed by his supporters but received quite a cynical response from other camps: After Castro and Biden\u2019s tense exchange, Pete Buttigieg tried to bring the candidates together by saying that moments like these are why primary debates are becoming \u201cunwatchable.\u201d But Castro interjected, \u201cThat\u2019s called an election.\u201d Harris then tried to also strike a note of harmony by saying, \u201cA house divided cannot stand.\u201d But that comment did not seem to elicit much applause. Biden and Castro just got into a tense exchange about health care, in which Castro accused the former vice president of flip-flopping from what he said just moments ago. In a moment that elicited gasps from the audience, Castro asked Biden, \u201cAre you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?\u201d The repeated question likely struck a chord, given Biden\u2019s repeated gaffes in recent weeks where he has mixed up, for example, the sites of mass shootings. Juli\u00e1n Castro continued with the Obama praise, saying the American people owe the former Democratic president a debt of gratitude. Castro, Obama\u2019s former housing and urban development secretary, distanced himself from the president\u2019s immigration policy in the last debate. Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders continue to dive into the weeds of their health care plans. When Sanders specifically referenced the potential case of a cancer patient, Biden interjected, \u201cI know a lot about cancer, and let me tell you something.\u201d Biden lost his son, Beau, to brain cancer in 2015. Okay, so this is a notable and clearly purposeful shift from the second debate. Biden complained after that debate that he felt his opponents were too critical of Obama\u2019s legacy, a gripe that seemed to register with some Democratic voters. So this time around, candidates are making a point to thank Obama for his contribution. Kamala Harris started her answer on health care by thanking Obama and Sanders for their contribution to the US health care system before calling out Trump\u2019s efforts to gut the Affordable Care Act. But that allowed her to sidestep a question on why she rescinded her support for Medicare-for-all. Buttigieg said Medicare-for-all doesn\u2019t \u201ctrust the American people\u201d because it takes options away, such as private insurance. Sanders replied that private insurance can be unstable because of its connection to employment, resulting in people losing health coverage if they lose their jobs. Klobuchar, who slammed some of her opponents for being too extreme in her opening statement, used her answer on health care to note she and Sanders have worked together to lower prescription drug prices. But then she went in for the kill. \u201cWhile Bernie wrote the bill, I read the bill,\u201d Klobuchar said of Medicare-for-all. She emphasized the tens of millions of people who would lose their private insurance under the plan. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a bold idea; I think that\u2019s a bad idea,\u201d Klobuchar said. Biden asserted his plan, which would expand upon Obamacare, would give Americans more options than Medicare-for-all. He noted people would have the option to stay with their plans if they liked it. Warren replied with this line that could be one of her biggest of the night: \u201cI\u2019ve never actually met anybody who likes their health-insurance company,\u201d she said. Sanders, taking his first question on health care, reiterated his line from the second debate writing \u201cthe damn bill\u201d on Medicare-for-all. It seemed to get a bigger response last time. The Vermont senator said America could not afford to continue with the \u201cstatus quo\u201d and argued that it would cost less money over time to go with a single-payer system. Warren defended her health care proposals, saying they would allow middle-class families to pay less for their insurance. She emphasized that costs would go up for wealthy Americans and corporations, but they would go down for average families. Joe Biden took his first question, on health care, to tie Elizabeth Warren to Bernie Sanders while linking himself to Barack Obama. The former vice president said Warren is \u201cfor Bernie,\u201d while he is \u201cfor Barack.\u201d Biden oddly avoided saying either Warren or Sanders\u2019 names, repeatedly referring to them as \u201cthe senator.\u201d Joe Biden touted the message of American exceptionalism, arguing opportunities will be limitless once the country removes its current president. \u201cThere\u2019s enormous, enormous opportunities once we get rid of Donald Trump,\u201d Biden said. After an awkwardly long pause, Bernie Sanders launched into his opening statement, which was somewhat hobbled by his apparent cold. That could be a problem over the next three hours as the Vermont senator debates his opponents. Elizabeth Warren referenced her history to the University of Houston just down the road from the debate site and promised to offer the same opportunities to American families. Pete Buttigieg referenced the September 11 anniversary in his opening statement. The Indiana mayor is a veteran of the war in Afghanistan. Kamala Harris directly addressed Trump in her opening statement, saying the only reason he was not indicted was because of a policy warning against indicting a sitting president. The California senator said she knew Trump was watching the debate. When she concluded, Harris told the president he could \u201cgo back to watching Fox News.\u201d Presidential candidate or game show host? Andrew Yang just followed through on his promise to offer a year of his promised universal basic income to 10 people if they go to his campaign website. The offer was met with laughter \u2013 both in the media room here in Houston and apparently onstage, as one of the other candidates could be heard chuckling. Beto O\u2019Rourke used his opening statement to remind the audience of the mass shooting that shook his hometown of El Paso last month. The attack by a white nationalist left 22 people dead, and O\u2019Rourke has since been even more vocal about his support for gun control, including a mandatory buyback of assault weapons. Juli\u00e1n Castro, a former mayor of San Antonio, pledged in his opening statement that Texas would turn blue next year. Amy Klobuchar offered this punny warning about Trump\u2019s presidency: \u201cHouston, we have a problem.\u201d Get it? Because we\u2019re in Houston, guys! Brilliant. But Klobuchar also took aim at the more progressive candidates onstage, offering a \u201cbetter way\u201d to combat the nation\u2019s problems. ABC News host George Stephanopoulos opened the debate by emphasizing that it is a first for the 2020 Democratic primary. \u201cA single debate in a single night with all the top candidates facing off,\u201d the host said. Anchor Jorge Ramos, another moderator, offered a Spanish introduction that he then translated into English. Ramos said in his translation that Latinos in America were facing \u201cdifficult times,\u201d but he added, \u201cThis is our country, too.\u201d The candidates have taken the stage, and ABC News\u2019 montage of the participating candidates has started. Stay tuned for the opening statements. ABC News made a point to emphasize to candidates before the debate that this is a family network, folks. \u201cWe wanted to take this opportunity to remind you that, as the debate will air on the ABC broadcast network, we are governed by Federal Communications Commission indecency rules,\u201d Rick Klein, the network\u2019s political director, wrote in a memo forwarded to the campaigns. Klein added: \u201cCandidates should therefore avoid cursing or expletives in accordance with federal law.\u201d One candidate in particular, Beto O\u2019Rourke, has made headlines for repeatedly cursing to express his frustration with inaction on gun control. Maybe if he says it in Spanish, the network won\u2019t bleep him? The format of tonight\u2019s debates will be very similar to the first two with candidates receiving one minute and 15 seconds for direct responses to questions and 45 seconds for responses and rebuttals. The candidates will deliver opening statements, but no closing statements \u2013 which is a change from the second debate. And the debate will be moderated by four of ABC News\u2019 hosts: George Stephanopoulos, David Muir, Linsey Davis and Jorge Ramos. Most debate viewers\u2019 eyes will be glued to center stage tonight, where two front-runners will confront each other for the first time: Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren. Despite a number of recent gaffes, Biden has held on to his polling edge, but Warren has recently chipped away at his advantage as the Massachusetts senator has repeatedly finished neck-and-neck with Bernie Sanders. But unlike Sanders, whose polling has been relatively stagnant, Warren has enjoyed a steady rise over the summer. The contrast between Biden and Warren reflects the question at the heart of this primary race: should Democrats play it safe with a well-known establishment candidate promising to build on Barack Obama\u2019s legacy, or bet the house with a more progressive candidate demanding systematic change? Moderators will likely ask this very question tonight in an attempt to bait Biden and Warren into a fight over their grander vision for the future. If they do, will Sanders try to jump into the fray by presenting himself as the truer progressive? Or will he and Warren tag-team the more moderate candidates, as they did during the second debate? We\u2019ll find out in the next couple of hours. Many environmental activists are hoping climate change will be a central theme of tonight\u2019s debate, particularly given that the city hosting the debate has experienced the most devastating effects of extreme weather. Hurricane Harvey struck Houston two years ago, destroying thousands of homes and claiming at least 68 lives. In recent years, such \u201c500-year\u201d storms have become increasingly common. The Bahamas are the latest tragic example of that trend, as the country wrestles with the devastation wrought by Hurricane Dorian. Environmental activists complained that the first two debates spent too little time discussing what they consider the defining crisis of our time. And they have lost their greatest champion in the 2020 field, Washington governor Jay Inslee \u2013 who based his campaign around combating the climate crisis but dropped out last month. In the time since, more candidates have released their climate proposals, and CNN hosted a seven-hour (yes, seven-hour) town hall solely dedicated to the issue. But many who fear time is running out on halting the earth\u2019s warming hope the issue will receive more coverage in tonight\u2019s debate. She occupied a unique space in the first two debates, framing the problem of taking on Donald Trump as a national psychic challenge, asking America to let love rule and making a powerful call for slavery reparations. But tonight, self-help author Marianne Williamson, not having garnered the requisite polling and donor numbers to make the cut, will be watching the debate from home. Assuming she doesn\u2019t TiVo it. If the point of the presidential debates is to showcase the range of ideas about how to lead the country and in which direction, it\u2019s tempting to wonder what good it does to have seven members or former members of Congress onstage \u2013 with all the repetitive and dull political speech that mix is bound to produce \u2013 but to exclude a candidate who made herself a standout, and was a clear crowd-pleaser, back in July with lines like this: \u201cIf you think any of this wonkiness is going to deal with this dark psychic force of the collectivized hatred that this president is bringing up in this country, then I\u2019m afraid that the Democrats are going to see some very dark days. We need to say it like it is... \u201c Maybe next time? Williamson hit the debate\u2019s donor threshold, so she could still appear in No.4 if she gets those polling numbers up. We\u2019re about a half an hour away from the debate\u2019s start time, so here is a refresher on who will appear onstage tonight. Joe Biden, the former vice president who continues to lead in polls despite a number of recent gaffes. But Biden\u2019s polling advantage appears to be narrowing in recent weeks. Can he pick up lost supporters tonight? Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator who enjoyed a steady climb in the polls this summer. Warren has already turned in two solid debate performances, so expectations will be high for the third debate. And it\u2019s the first time she\u2019s faced Biden, but more on that later. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator and two-time presidential candidate running on a progressive platform based around Medicare-for-all. But Sanders has had trouble getting ahead of his fellow progressive senator, Warren. Kamala Harris, the California senator who has slipped back to single-digits in polls after a bump from her first debate performance. Harris appears to have slipped from the top tier of candidates and might need a bold move tonight to recover lost ground. Pete Buttigieg, the millennial mayor from Indiana who enjoyed a burst of enthusiasm this spring. But the military veteran has been relatively stagnant since then and could benefit from a standout performance. Andrew Yang, the tech entrepreneur who has crept ahead of more \u201cestablishment\u201d candidates with his campaign promise of enacting universal basic income. But the real question is: will he wear a tie? Beto O\u2019Rourke, the former congressman who is back in his home state for this debate. O\u2019Rourke took time away from the campaign trail to help his home town of El Paso heal from a mass shooting that left 22 dead. He will likely reference the shooting tonight to demand action on gun control. Cory Booker, the New Jersey senator who has struggled to break past 2 percent in polls. He and Biden had a heated discussion about criminal justice reform in the last debate, and the topic is likely to resurface tonight. Amy Klobuchar, the Minnesota senator who has argued she has the right message and profile to appeal to Midwestern voters who went for Trump in 2016. But she has so far been largely unable to pull voters away from Biden, who has made a similar \u201celectability\u201d argument. Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former housing and urban development secretary who has put immigration at the center of his campaign. The former San Antonio mayor will almost certainly be asked tonight about his plan to decriminalize border crossings, a proposal that has now drawn the support of several of his competitors. All ten of those candidates will soon take the stage, so stay tuned. The Democrats have visions of turning the Lone Star state blue. They point to 2018, when now-presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke came within 3 percentage points of beating incumbent senator Ted Cruz. The last time a Democrat was elected statewide in Texas was 1994. Down ballot, Democrats flipped two congressional seats in the state and made major gains at the local level, sweeping Harris County and picking up House and Senate seats. The party is gaining traction in the once-reliably Republican suburbs, where college-educated voters and particularly women recoiled from Trump as well as from an expanding Latino electorate that trends overwhelmingly Democratic. Five Republican members of Congress from Texas have announced their retirement in recent weeks, a trend Democrats have gleefully dubbed the \u201cTexodus\u201d. They say the Republican departures are indicative of Democrats growing strength in the state. Not all the congressional districts are competitive - but it is a sign that their hope of recapturing the House is increasingly unlikely. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said she considers Texas \u201cground zero for us next election\u201d. Two Texans are running for president: O\u2019Rourke and Juli\u00e1n Castro. Both have suggested that Texas\u2019s electoral treasure chest would be up for grabs if they were on the ticket. But demographic shifts won\u2019t happen overnight and the odds remain long that the state will turn the state blue in 2020. Still, Democrats are poised to make some gains \u2013 and if everything\u2019s bigger in Texas, the political fight here will be one to watch. We may have an answer to what big, unprecedented surprise Andrew Yang will reveal at tonight\u2019s debate, and it is ... rather underwhelming. But the Democratic presidential candidates who missed the debate stage this time around \u2013 including Steve Bullock, Tom Steyer and Tim Ryan\u2013 are showing no signs of calling it quits. Bullock, the Montana governor, offered this oh-so-subtle Twitter message earlier today: And Ryan and Steyer are holding events in the early voting states of New Hampshire and Iowa. Ryan has said he may continue on with his bid even if he doesn\u2019t make the cut for the fourth debate, so he\u2019s definitely in this for the long haul. \u201cIf I\u2019m doing well in September, October in polling, we\u2019ll probably just keep going,\u201d Ryan told Bloomberg News last week. Ten candidates! Three hours! One night only! How we got from 20 candidates over two nights to 10 candidates over a single night says a lot about where we are in the Democratic primary race. The stakes are getting higher and the threshold for qualifying is getting tougher. To qualify for the debate in Houston and the next one in Ohio, candidates had to amass 130,000 individual donors and capture 2% in four qualifying polls. The threshold is the same for the October debate. To be sure, this isn\u2019t an impossibly hard task, especially considering the position they\u2019re running for and how jazzed Democrats are about 2020. But a massive field and a Trump-obsessed media landscape have made it difficult for candidates to break through. Four candidates bowed to that reality and left the race after it was clear they wouldn\u2019t qualify for the debates: Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, John Hickenlooper, Jay Inslee and Seth Moulton. There are still 10 candidates running for president who did not qualify for the debate. Among them, Tom Steyer, the activist billionaire, says he has met the threshold for the October debate and congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard is close to qualifying. Their inclusion could push the debates back to two nights. The remaining candidates spend much of their time on the trail defending their continued presence in a race that many primary voters believe is simply too big. Democrats like Montana Governor Steve Bullock and Ohio Congressman Tim Ryan, both Democrats elected in states that voted for Trump, are testing new ways to draw attention. Bullock published a BuzzFeed listicle of \u201cdad jokes that are just as groan-worthy as they are funny\u201d while Ryan released a Spotify playlist of his key policy planks. The Democratic presidential candidates participating in tonight\u2019s debate have been preparing for the big event with their families. Amy Klobuchar and Juli\u00e1n Castro both posted tweets with their children in the hours before the debate: And Kamala Harris\u2019 husband shared a photo of the California senator before she hits the stage: It\u2019s well known that healthcare was the biggest issue among voters in the 2018 midterms. But it\u2019s still astonishing to see just how much this is the case when measured in Google search interest. In the below maps, which show the most searched for issues in three early-voting states in the Democratic primary, you can see how much healthcare (colored grey) dominates almost every district in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. Iowa New Hampshire South Carolina Senator, senator, mayor, senator, ex-veep, senator, senator, former congressman, former secretary, Andrew Yang. One of these things is not like the other, and he is Yang, an entrepreneur and philanthropist whose personal charisma and unique platform \u2013 curb automation, add a universal basic income \u2013 have produced a surprisingly potent presidential bid. Yang not only racked up the poll numbers and donor totals to win a place in the third debate \u2013 he is noticeably, and remarkably, closer to the center of the stage than some pretty big names like Beto O\u2019Rourke and Cory Booker. Positions onstage are awarded by polling average, with the best performers in the middle. Here\u2019s the order: senator Amy Klobuchar, Booker, mayor Pete Buttigieg, senator Bernie Sanders, former vice president Joe Biden, senator Elizabeth Warren, senator Kamala Harris, Andrew Yang, O\u2019Rourke and former HUD secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro. Will Yang take advantage of tonight\u2019s debate to move even closer to the middle next time? Apparently he has a plan in store for tonight: And he\u2019s not offering any spoilers before the big event: Good evening, live blog readers! I\u2019m here in Houston waiting for the third Democratic debate to kick off in about an hour and half at Texas Southern University, a historically black university. As a reminder, tonight is the only night of the third debate \u2013 unlike the first two, which were two-night events. Because only 10 candidates qualified this time around, the stage has shrunk considerably. But don\u2019t worry: ABC News has kindly scheduled the debate to last for three hours to make up for that loss. The blog will dive more into who missed the debate stage \u2013 and why \u2013 a bit closer to the event\u2019s 8pm ET start time, but for now, enjoy this video of senator Cory Booker preparing for the debate by repeatedly trying to adjust his podium. All the fireworks are still to come, so stay tuned.",

Trudeau, who swept to office in November 2015 promising \u201csunny ways\u201d and stressing the importance of gender equality and the environment, faces an electorate which will be much more focused on the economy. The country\u2019s 43rd election also comes against the backdrop of protracted political scandal for the incumbent prime minister. For months, Trudeau has faced accusations \u2013 including from the country\u2019s ethics commissioner \u2013 that he acted improperly when he requested his attorney general to halt criminal prosecution of the Quebec-based engineering giant SNC Lavalin. Trudeau and his Liberals are widely expected to use the election to shore up support for his government\u2019s climate change policies, including a nationwide carbon tax. His main opponent, the Conservative leader, Andrew Scheer, has pledged to repeal the Liberals\u2019 marquee environmental legislation. Scheer, the youngest federal leader and running in his first federal campaign as head of the party, has consistently used the prime minister\u2019s ethical lapses to paint the government as unable to govern effectively.

President says he \u2018disagreed strongly\u2019 with hawkish Bolton Donald Trump has fired his national security adviser, John Bolton, saying he \u201cdisagreed strongly\u201d with his hawkish attitude to foreign affairs. The two men also appeared to disagree on whether he jumped or was pushed, with Bolton claiming he had offered to resign before the president announced his dismissal. Trump is expected to name a new national security adviser \u2013 his fourth in less than three years \u2013 next week. Personality clash. The bellicose Bolton might have buried the achievements of the Obama administration, but he was never going to give Trump the diplomatic wins he\u2019d like to brandish on the campaign trail, writes Julian Borger. Foreign policy. Bolton\u2019s dismissal will very likely lead to a change of emphasis in foreign policy, says Patrick Wintour, with the president\u2019s anti-interventionist instincts and preference for personal diplomacy potentially coming to the fore. How Rick Scott\u2019s Florida refused $70m to tackle HIV crisis Florida\u2019s HIV crisis reached a severity almost without equal in the US under Rick Scott, the state\u2019s governor from 2011 to 2019. Now, a Guardian investigation has revealed his administration effectively blocked $70m in federal funds to fight the epidemic. From 2015 to 2017, Florida sent back $54m for combating HIV to the US government after health chiefs failed to secure legislative permission to spend it. And in 2015, Scott\u2019s administration blocked grants worth a total of $16m for two counties with unusually high HIV rates. HIV rates. HIV diagnoses were declining in Florida until 2013, only to increase by nearly 11% through 2017. Of the 10 states that account for 65% of new HIV cases nationally, Florida was the only one to experience an increase between 2010 and 2017. Budget authority. Now a Republican senator, Scott made it a bedrock principle of his governorship to refuse federal dollars. In a statement, a Scott spokeswoman said \u201cthe state could only spend the money that it had the budget authority to spend\u201d. Trump-backed Republican wins North Carolina special election A Trump-endorsed Republican has won a fiercely contested congressional special election in North Carolina, a race seen as a bellwether for the president\u2019s 2020 re-election hopes. The conservative state senator Dan Bishop had been running almost neck and neck with the Democrat Dan McCready, a former Marine and Harvard graduate, in the state\u2019s traditionally Republican 9th district. But Bishop declared victory late on Tuesday after securing 50.8% of the vote to McCready\u2019s 48.8%. Bathroom bill. Bishop was previously best known for co-sponsoring North Carolina\u2019s \u201cbathroom bill\u201d, which forced transgender people to use bathrooms matching the gender on their birth certificates in state buildings. The law was subsequently repealed after a national outcry. Arab leaders decry Netanyahu\u2019s West Bank annexation plan Arab foreign ministers convened in Cairo late on Tuesday for an emergency meeting to denounce Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s new plan to annex further swaths of the Palestinian West Bank if he is re-elected next week. The Israeli prime minister, who is battling to build a governing coalition in the country\u2019s elections on 17 September, held a live press conference on Tuesday to unveil the plan that, if implemented, would effectively sink Palestinian hopes for statehood.

The Arab League said Netanyahu\u2019s proposal would \u201c[undermine] the chances of any progress in the peace process and will torpedo all its foundations\u201d. Cheat sheet Three Australians, two of them dual UK citizens, have been imprisoned in Iran amid rising tensions with a US-led coalition that includes the UK and Australia. The UK on Tuesday accused Iran of selling oil to Syria from a tanker British forces had previously seized and released. Californian lawmakers have passed a landmark bill designed to make it significantly more difficult for companies such as Uber and Lyft to classify gig economy workers as independent contractors rather than employees. Russian authorities initially investigated the 2017 disappearance of the Kremlin official Oleg Smolenkov as a murder, before concluding he was still alive and living abroad. Smolenkov is now suspected of being a CIA mole who was spirited away to the US. Justin Trudeau will on Wednesday request the dissolution of the Canadian parliament, as campaigning begins for the 21 October election, at which the prime minister will seek a second term despite an increasingly divided electorate.
