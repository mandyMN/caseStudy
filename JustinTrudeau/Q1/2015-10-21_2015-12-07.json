          "bodyText": "A recording has emerged purporting to be of police radio as the shoot out unfolded. You can read our latest coverage of the unfolding story in San Bernardino here. Our latest news story is here: A couple have been killed in a police gun battle hours after they took part in a mass shooting that left at least 14 people dead and 17 wounded in San Bernardino, California. The couple, named as Syed Farook and his partner Tashfeen Malik, were shot dead by police officers following a car chase through the streets of the city. Police said Farook and Malik, aged 28 and 27 respectively, were intercepted and a gun battle with more than 20 officers left their dark SUV riddled with bullets and both suspects dead. The chase came about four hours after Farook had left a gathering of fellow public health employees of San Bernardino county where he worked. Police said he was angry and left early only to return with his partner. Both were heavily armed. The attack at the Inland Regional Center, which lies 60 miles (95km) east of Los Angeles, was the deadliest shooting on US soil since the Sandy Hook school massacre in 2012. According to San Bernardino police chief Jarrod Burguan, one officer was shot and transported to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries after the pursuit. Two rifles and two handguns were found in the SUV that had been stopped. During the hunt for the couple a third person was taken into custody, police said, although they said they were confident the couple were the only ones responsible for the killings. Read the full article: Following the latest police news conference, here is what we now know about Wednesday\u2019s deadly attack in San Bernardino: 14 people have been killed and 17 injured in a mass shooting at the Inland Regional Center, a community center for people with disabilities. The two attackers were named as Syed Rizwan Farook, a 28-year-old man, and Tashfeen Malik, a 27-year-old woman. Police said they were in a relationship and possibly married. Both suspects were killed after engaging in a shootout with police while fleeing in a dark-coloured SUV. The two suspects were armed with assault rifles and handguns, and were dressed in dark clothing \u201cloaded with magazines for a gunfight\u201d. A third person who was detained close to the shoot-out has not been identified and it is not certain he was involved in the attack on the center. Police chief Jarrod Burguan said \u201cthere had to be some degree of planning in this\u201d and multiple explosive devices have been found at the Inland Regional Center. Farook, an employee of the environmental health team, was involved in a dispute at a Christmas party being held at the center on Wednesday morning, and left before returning to open fire, police said. Farhan Khan, Farook\u2019s brother-in-law, said he had \u201cabsolutely no idea\u201d why his relative would have carried out the massacre. An FBI official, David Bowdich, said it was too early to class this as an act of terrorism: I am still not willing to say if we know that for sure \u2026 It is a possibility but we don\u2019t know that yet and we\u2019re not willing to go down that road yet. FBI agents are still searching a house in Redlands, south-east of San Bernardino, which is connected to Farook. That police press conference is over, with the key announcement that the two dead suspects have been identified as Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik. I\u2019ll post a summary shortly. Burguan says that based on the armour and level of preparation, \u201cthere had to be some degree of planning in this\u201d. Multiple explosive devices have been disposed of, he says. He says investigators think they were a \u201cpipe bomb-type design\u201d but he can\u2019t confirm that at this stage. Burguan says police have not ruled out terrorism as a motive. He doesn\u2019t know what the motive was at this point. He says police have spent some hours working on what they believe to be explosive devices at the center. None of the victims have been identified yet, he says, as police have only just gained access to the scene. Burguan says he\u2019s \u201cpretty comfortable\u201d that the two shooters in the center are the two suspects who are now dead. Burguan says there was a relationship between the two suspects, but it\u2019s not clear if they were married or engaged. He says it\u2019s also unclear if a third person, who was detained at the scene of the gun battle with police, is involved. Burguan says a meeting, or party, was taking place at the Inland Regional Center. Farook has been employed at the public health department for five years and was at the meeting. He was involved in a dispute, left and returned to shoot, Burguan says. The two suspects are named by Burguan: Syed Rizwan Farook, 28, US born Tashfeen Malik, 27 San Bernardino police chief Jarrod Burguan is speaking again. He says 14 people are confirmed dead, 17 wounded. He doesn\u2019t know the status of the wounded at this point. Hussam Ayloush, executive director of Cair in the Los Angeles area, is still briefing reporters. Police and FBI are due to give their own news conference shortly; so far none of the information relating to the identification of the suspects \u2013 beyond the fact that a man and a woman were killed in a shoot-out with officers \u2013 has been officially confirmed. Police have not yet confirmed the identity of any of the suspects involved in the attack. But at the Cair press conference, Syed Farook was named as one of them by his brother-in-law, Farhan Khan. Reuters reports that Farook and his wife have been missing since Wednesday morning, citing Hussam Ayloush, executive director of Cair in the Los Angeles area. A person by the name of Syed Farook was listed on county documents as an employee of the San Bernardino county environmental health department, Reuters said. Staff members from that department had gathered on Wednesday for the party where the shooters opened fire. Some more details from that Cair press conference. Farhan Khan, who identified himself as the brother-in-law of one of the suspects, said he has no idea what might have motivated the attack. Khan, who said his sister was married to one of the people suspected of carrying out the massacre in San Bernardino, offered his condolences to the victims. \u201cWhy would he do that? Why would he do something like this? I have absolutely no idea, I am in shock myself,\u201d Khan said at a news conference in Anaheim, California. Khan says he last spoke to Farook about a week ago. He is reported to be married to Saira Khan, sister of Syed Farook, who has been named in media reports as one of the suspects. The police news conference due to be happening now has been pushed back for an hour: That\u2019s 10pm PST (6am GMT/5pm AEDT). Khan says he cannot tell reporters anything about the suspect but wanted to convey his and his family\u2019s sadness and condolences to the victims. The brother-in-law of a suspect speaks now. (It is not clarified which suspect they are referring to; I will add this when I find out. Edit 9pm PST: local media reports say Farhan Khan is the brother-in-law of Syed Farook, and is married to Farook\u2019s sister.) Farhan Khan says he cannot express how sad he is: I am in shock that something like this can happen. He says he has \u201cno idea \u2026 why he would do something like this\u201d. The LA Cair (Council on American\u2013Islamic Relations) press conference is starting now. Chair of the Islamic Council of South California Muzammil Siddiqi speaks. He expresses his \u201csadness and sorrow\u201d for those killed and injured: \u201cWe are in solidarity with them.\u201d He condemns this \u201chorrible violence\u201d. Please do not condemn Islam, he says. CNN reports that ATF has confirmed that at least one of the four firearms retrieved by investigators was legally purchased. The name of the purchaser, or the location, has not been made public. As well as the Cair press conference, due imminently, we are also due to hear from police and FBI officials again within the next 15 minutes. I\u2019ll have updates from both on this live blog. The Los Angeles branch of Cair (Council on American\u2013Islamic Relations) is due to hold a press conference at which it says the relative of a suspect named in media reports will speak. Executive director Hussam Ayloush said in a statement: We condemn this horrific and revolting attack and offer our heartfelt condolences to the families and loved ones of all those killed or injured. Here is what we know so far about the deadliest mass shooting in the US since Sandy Hook in 2012: 14 people have been killed and 17 injured in a mass shooting at the Inland Regional Center, a community center for people with disabilities. Two suspects were killed after engaging in a shootout with police: one male, one female. Both were travelling in a dark-coloured SUV. The two suspects were armed with assault rifles and handguns, and were dressed in dark clothing \u201cloaded with magazines for a gunfight\u201d. A third person who was seen leaving the area of the shootout was detained. He has not been identified and it is not certain he was directly involved in the attack on the center. Several media outlets have named one of the suspects in the mass shooting as Syed Farook, but the Guardian has not been able to verify this. Police are still searching the Inland Regional Center, where a potentially explosive device has been found. An FBI official, David Bowdich, said it was too early to class this as an act of terrorism: I am still not willing to say if we know that for sure \u2026 It is a possibility but we don\u2019t know that yet and we\u2019re not willing to go down that road yet. FBI agents are still searching a house in Redlands, south-east of San Bernardino, which is reportedly connected to at least one of the suspects. Police said there was a dispute at a Christmas party being held at the center, after which someone left, but cannot confirm if this alleged argument is connected to the attack. Several media outlets \u2013 including the Los Angeles Times, New York Times and Associated Press \u2013 have named one of the suspects in the mass shooting as Syed Farook, citing anonymous law enforcement officials. The Guardian has not yet been able independently to verify this claim. It has not been officially confirmed. Reuters has this latest update: US Muslim advocacy group Cair (Council on American\u2013Islamic Relations) condemns California shooting, says a relative of one of the suspects named in media reports will take part in news conference. Several media outlets have reported a name in connection with the shooting. The Guardian is working to verify these reports. Carey Davis says he understands that the shooting took place at a Christmas party at the Inland Regional Center. The mayor of San Bernardino, Carey Davis, is speaking now. He says the community is coming together, and thanks those who have supported others caught up in the shooting. We as a city will do all we can for the victims of this violent crime. Davis says details of the investigation will be relayed by police and FBI officials, but confirms it is still an active situation. He says there will be a vigil in the coming days. Earlier, shortly after news broke of the attack, Barack Obama sent his sympathies to the families of those who were killed, adding that there is a \u201cpattern of mass shootings\u201d in the US that has \u201cno parallel anywhere else in the world\u201d. You can watch his comments here: Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau has also offered his condolences to the victims: The perimeter outside the Redlands property being searched by the FBI is being moved back, local reports say, and a mandatory evacuation of the surrounding area is beginning. There were reports earlier that the suspects had thrown a pipe bomb from their vehicle during the police pursuit, but the ATF now says that pipe did not contain explosives. The ATF\u2019s Meredith Davis said the thick-gauge copper pipe was equipped with a piece of material made to look like a wick, Associated Press reports. Davis said the man and woman were each armed with a long gun and a handgun, and wearing clothing \u201cloaded with magazines for a gunfight\u201d. Authorities are tracing the serial numbers on the guns and authorities will be dispatched to the related addresses, Davis said. Associated Press has some more detail of the ongoing raid in Redlands: Law enforcement officers are calling for people to come to the front door of a home in Redlands, California, where tips led authorities investigating the deadly shooting. One of them called out: \u201cThis is the FBI.\u201d Officers in riot gear, a bomb squad unit and armoured vehicles are outside. They appear to have brought in robot devices. It\u2019s unclear if anyone is inside the home. San Bernardino police chief Jarrod Burguan said an SUV was seen leaving the residence earlier, leading to a police pursuit and a gunbattle that killed two suspects in the shooting that left 14 people dead in neighbouring San Bernardino. This map shows the key locations involved in today\u2019s mass shooting: An attack on the Inland Regional Center leaves 14 people dead and 17 wounded. Two suspects \u2013 one male and one female \u2013 die after engaging police in a gun battle. An FBI search is ongoing at a property in Redlands believed to be connected to the attack. The ATF (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives) has confirmed that four weapons \u2013 two rifles and two handguns \u2013 have been recovered. Police chief Jarrod Burguan earlier said the two dead suspects were armed with assault rifles and handguns. The FBI operation at the Redlands home is ongoing. It is still not been confirmed what the relationship is between the property and the shooting or suspects. Several reporters say they saw a robot \u2013 possibly for bomb disposal \u2013 going into the house, after which a loud noise was heard. The San Bernardino police chief, Jarrod Burguan, said officers were working with caution in Redlands and the center that was the target of the shooting because of the possibility of explosive devices. The footage shows the police pursuit of the shooting suspects. We now know that two people were killed in the resulting gun battle, one male and one female. A police officer was also wounded, although the injuries are not life-threatening. The New York Daily News has just tweeted out its Thursday front page and it\u2019s not holding back, as several Republican presidential candidates call for prayers for the victims: The latest update from the San Bernardino police and FBI has shed a lot of light on the unfolding situation. Here is what we now know: Two suspects were killed after engaging in a shootout with police: one male, one female. Both were armed with assault rifles and handguns, and were dressed in dark clothing. A third person who was seen leaving the area of the shootout was detained. He has not been identified and it is not certain he was directly involved in the attack on the center. Police are still searching the Inland Regional Center, where 14 people were killed. A potentially explosive device has been found. An FBI official, David Bowdich, said it was too early to class this as an act of terrorism: I am still not willing to say if we know that for sure \u2026 It is a possibility but we don\u2019t know that yet and we\u2019re not willing to go down that road yet. FBI agents are searching a house in Redlands, south-east of San Bernardino. Police said there was a dispute at a Christmas party being held at the center, after which someone left, but cannot confirm if this is connected to the attack. Burguan says there will be another press conference about 8.30pm-9pm PST (in about an hour and 45 minutes). I\u2019ll post a summary of that key police and FBI update very shortly. The man and woman who died were engaged in a gun battle with police officers, Burguan says. The person who has been detained was leaving the area of the shootout, he says. It is not clear if he was directly involved. He has not been identified. Burguan says there was a dispute at a Christmas party being held at the center, after which someone left. He says he cannot confirm if this is connected to the later attack. Burguan says he does not know the motive for the attack. Police are taking a very cautious approach, he says. We feel confident about the neighbourhood \u2026 that we have secured that and there is nobody outstanding there. We are tracking down that information \u2026 to identify if there was a third person involved [in the shooting]. He says it is not confirmed if the person detained was involved in the shooting. We are back to police chief Burguan. He says a third person has been detained. Bowdich says he has been asked if this is terrorism: I am still not willing to say if we know that for sure \u2026 It is a possibility but we don\u2019t know that yet and we\u2019re not willing to go down that road yet. The relationship between the two suspects isn\u2019t known, he says. He says there is a third suspect. David Bowdich, an FBI official, is speaking now. He says officials will apply \u201call the resources necessary \u2026 to assure we have chased down every lead\u201d. FBI agents are searching the house in Redlands now, he says. Police are treating the vehicle with caution as it might contain explosives, Burguan says. The news conference is starting now. The San Bernardino police chief, Jarrod Burguan, is updating us. He says police are still searching the building. There is potentially an explosive device inside and they are taking a slow, cautious approach. Burguan says the two suspects were killed in the shootout: one male, one female. Both were armed with assault rifles and handguns. After updating reporters on the condition of five shooting victims, a spokeswoman for the Loma Linda University medical center said: We\u2019re all shaken by this. We\u2019re all bothered by this. I think we should all go home to our loved ones and understand this could happen any time and we have to be prepared for it. Seventeen people were wounded in the shooting at the Inland Regional Center and are being cared for in a number of hospitals. Five \u2013 all adults \u2013 are being treated at the Loma Linda University medical center. Two are critical but stable, two \u201cfair\u201d and one is still being assessed, hospital officials said. Families have been informed. A police officer was also wounded in the later shootout but it has not been confirmed at which hospital the officer is being treated. Associated Press has this latest from Redlands, south-east of San Bernardino: \u201cPolice are serving a search warrant on a home in Redlands, California, in connection with the deadly shooting at a social services facility in neighbouring San Bernardino. \u201cCity spokesman Carl Baker says Redlands police are assisting San Bernardino police in the search connected to the Wednesday morning shooting that killed at least 14 people and wounded more than a dozen others. \u201cAn Associated Press reporter watched as a half-dozen vehicles carrying helmeted police drove into the area. One officer carrying an assault rifle ordered reporters to clear the area, and an armoured vehicle parked outside a row of homes. \u201cThe action followed a gun battle between occupants of an SUV and San Bernardino police not far from the original shooting scene.\u201d The news conference with the San Bernardino police chief hasn\u2019t yet started. It\u2019s not unusual for these things to run late in such a dynamic unfolding situation. I will bring you the latest as soon as it begins. Local media reports that the lockdown on San Bernardino schools has been lifted. Staff and students are allowed to leave, and parents have been encouraged to collect their children. It is not clear yet if this indicates that police believe the situation with the suspect(s) to be under control. We are still awaiting a news conference, which is imminent. Edit 5pm PST: road closures mean parents are now being asked to wait before collecting their children. We are expecting another news conference from the San Bernardino police chief, Jarrod Burguan, in about five minutes. We\u2019ll have live updates on this blog. The Association of Regional Center Agencies \u2013 Inland Regional Center, site of today\u2019s shooting, was part of its network \u2013 has put out a statement. There are no known threats against other any locations, it says, but eight centres closed early as a precautionary measure. It does not know the motivation for the attack, it says: What we do have are heavy hearts, knowing innocent lives were cut short. Regional centers connect families and people with developmental disabilities to services and supports. They are places of connection and community. Any act of violence is a tragedy. But in a place focused on service to people with developmental disabilities, it is even harder to comprehend. Police say two suspects have been \u201cdealt with\u201d and one is \u201cdown\u201d. Sgt Vicki Cervantes told reporters that one suspect was shot in a battle with officers, but could not confirm if that suspect had died. The dark SUV with shattered windows remains on a residential street surrounded by armoured police vehicles. Local TV channels report that police officers are moving from door-to-door in search of a possible third suspect. It is not confirmed that there is a suspect on the loose, although earlier reports said up to three attackers had been seen at the scene of the mass shooting. The governor of California, Jerry Brown, has issued a statement: California will spare no effort in bringing these killers to justice. Brown was scheduled to light the Capitol Christmas tree on Wednesday evening, Associated Press reports, but his office said the ceremony would be cancelled. This is Claire Phipps picking up the live blog for continuing coverage. Police are warning residents of San Bernardino to stay indoors: Police have confirmed that two suspects have been \u201cdealt with\u201d \u2013 there are no further details. They say it is possible a third suspect is on the loose. One police officer has been injured but police say his condition \u201cis not life-threatening\u201d. 14 people are confirmed to have been killed and at least 17 injured Two suspects are reported to be \u201cdown\u201d, and police say \u201cthere is still possibly a suspect outstanding\u201d. There are unconfirmed reports of police pursuing a third suspect in a residential neighbourhood. The LA Times justice and FBI reporter, Rick Serrano: In a residential area two miles east of the shooting site, at least three Swat vehicles have surrounded a black SUV where one suspect is believed to have been killed. According to NBC Bay Area news, which is broadcasting live pictures via helicopter, a second suspect is lying in the street. Sgt Vicki Cervantes, a spokeswoman for the San Bernardino police, has told reporters there are now at least 17 people being treated for injuries. She said that as far as police know there are 14 people dead. The bearcat trucks have crawled slightly closer to the disabled vehicle, parking along its front and back as officers crowd around behind the armored cars. The officers appear to be looking for an angle to see into the dark-colored SUV, whose windows were blown out by bullets. San Bernadino police have confirmed an \u201cactive scene\u201d with more gunfire which appears to have broken out in the past hour, not far from where the shooting took place four hours ago. Local TV reports show a dark SUV-type vehicle parked beside a suburban road, jammed between two Swat vehicles, minutes after reports of an outbreak of gunfire. \u201cI believe there is a suspect down,\u201d Sgt Vicki Cervantes told reporters, stressing she did not know whether the incident was related to the earlier shooting. She dismisssed reports a police officer had been killed. \u201cIt is my understanding the officer is OK.\u201d Cervantes also said the number of injured victims had risen to 17. Update from San Bernadino police department, Sgt Vicki Cervantes: Confirmed 14 killed 17 injured Active scene with one suspect confirmed down Three armored cars are approaching the disabled SUV, which stands near an exposed police car. Heavily armed officers have taken up position behind the bearcats, weapons pointed toward the SUV. A large rifle lies on the street between the various vehicles. A police spokeswoman, Sgt Vicki Cervantes, has confirmed that the standoff is an active shooter situation. \u201cIt\u2019s an ongoing scene. They believe there may be a suspect there.\u201d She cannot confirm it is related to the shooting. \u201cWe believe there is one suspect down; it\u2019s very active.\u201d She believes an officer involved in a shootout is uninjured: \u201cThe only thing I know is there was shots fired, officers were involved, and there is a suspect down.\u201d Officers are now manoeuvring so as not to stand in each others\u2019 lines of fire, angling their weapons toward the disabled SUV. There appears to be at least one person lying prone at the disabled SUV, which footage shows to be shot through with bullet holes. Dozens of officers in small teams have gathered at a distance around the car, whose windshields were smashed out with gunshots. The SUV\u2019s driver-side and passenger door are hanging open. San Bernadino Mayor R Carey Davis said in a statement that the community has experienced \u201csevere loss and severe shock today\u201d and praised the response of the fire department and other agencies. \u201cIt is critical that in moments like these, our City unites in supporting the victims, their families, and the effort against crime in our City. We will continue to utilize all safety resources available to the San Bernadino community to deal with this tragedy. \u201cI pray that our community will join hands in an effort to uplift and support those who suffered loss, fear and shock today. We will continue to strive to be a safe and secure city in California.\u201d Police have disabled a black SUV and have surrounded it with armored cars and cruisers \u2013 they do not know whether the suspect car is related to the shooting but shots have been fired. Separately they have stopped one man in a parking lot after he tried to flee on foot. They similarly do not know whether this suspect has any relation to the shooting. Police are pursuing dark SUVs in the roads and highways in the San Bernardino area, but do not know whether any of the cars are related to the shooting. Meanwhile California governor Jerry Brown has cancelled a tree lighting due to the shooting. A bleak update from Rob McMillan of local ABC7 news, who\u2019s heard what police implied during their press conference almost an hour ago. A witness to the shooting\u2019s aftermath has described a \u201cnightmare\u201d of death, flight and fear to my colleague Rory Carroll, who is in San Bernardino. Alex Vasquez, an NBC4 cameraman who was driving nearby when a call from his newsdesk redirected him to the scene, said he had arrived as shooting still resounded through the building. \u2018They were the last shots fired,\u2019 he said, speaking hours later a mile from the scene. \u2018People were running. People had been shot inthe back, arms, chest. I saw a woman who was badly injured. She was on the ground, struggling. I saw her take her last breath.\u2019 Vasquez shook his head. \u2018These were people who got up in the morning and went to work and ended up in their worst nightmare.\u2019 Connecticut senator Chris Murphy, one of the most outspoken advocates for gun control in Congress, has released a statement on the shooting, which is the worst mass shooting since a gunman killed 26 people at a school in his state in 2012. My heart aches for the people of San Bernardino. I cannot express the profound sadness I feel each time a new community grieves and endures the same pain that brought Newtown to its knees three years ago this month. \u201cAs we await the facts from the chaos on the ground, I can only pray that America\u2019s leaders will do something \u2013 anything \u2013 that prevents more communities from knowing this sorrow. \u201cCongress\u2019 number one responsibility is to keep our constituents safe, and not a single senator or member of Congress can go back to their state this weekend and claim that they are doing their job.\u201d Activists from Everytown for Gun Safety, a pro-gun control group, have also commented on the shooting. Shannon Watts, the founder of one of the gun control coalition groups, exhorted Congress to action. \u201cThoughts and prayers \u2013 particularly from our lawmakers \u2013 are simply not enough. To reduce the gun violence that kills 88 Americans and injures hundreds more each day, we must demand our lawmakers act,\u201d she said. \u201cThe phrase \u2018another mass shooting\u2019 doesn\u2019t have to be a part of the American vocabulary.\u201d Police have a provided a destination for family to reunite with relatives who were trapped inside the Regional Center and then evacuated by school bus away from the complex. San Bernardino county police have asked the public to call with information about the three suspects believed to have attacked the Inland Regional Center. The suspects may have left in a darkly colored SUV, police said, and used \u201clong guns\u201d. \u201cThey were dressed in a way that indicated they were prepared,\u201d police chief Jarrod Burguan said. San Bernardino police and an FBI official held a press conference about the shooting at the Inland Regional Center. At least 14 people were killed, mostly in a conference center, when a shooter or shooters opened fire at about 11am PST. Police believe as many as three gunmen fled the scene in a dark SUV. They arrived with \u201clong guns\u201d and not handguns, police chief Jarrod Burguan said, and may have worn body armor. \u201cThey were dressed in a way that indicated they were prepared.\u201d At least 14 people have been injured and are being treated at regional hospitals. Scores of people were evacuated from the three-building complex, meeting with state and federal investigators for interviews and treatment. \u201cWe do not know if this was a terrorist incident,\u201d an FBI spokesperson told reporters. \u201cWe do not have any identification of who these suspects were,\u201d Burguan said, but added: \u201cat minimum we have a domestic terrorist type situation that occurred.\u201d Burguan said police are sweeping through the complex, area and city, and are working with schools and other officials to keep the area safe. He asked residents to be on high alert and report suspicious activity. My colleague Rory Carroll is on the scene in San Bernardino, where the press conference has just ended. \u201cI\u2019m just going to say it was a long gun, not a handgun,\u201d Burguan says when asked about the weapons of the gunmen. \u201cThey came in with a purpose, they came in with an intent.\u201d Burguan concludes the press conference: \u201cWe will be back on the hour every hour,\u201d at least for the afternoon and evening. Burguan answers a questions about why federal investigators are already \u201cWe have no information at this point to indicated that this is terrorism \u2026 in the traditional sense\u201d, he says. But since investigations \u201ccan turn into a potential federal prosecution type thing,\u201d he says the county asked for federal assistance immediately. \u201cAt minimum we have a domestic terrorist type situation that occurred.\u201d Burguan says that he has heard reports of as many as three suspects that have fled the scene, but that the situation remains \u201cfluid\u201d and that information could still change as the investigation continues. He says that police are at a \u201cheightened state of alert and \u201cwe would ask the public that they would be at a heightened sense of alert.\u201d A reporter asks about explosive technicians who are on the site. \u201cAs the teams were going through and searching \u2026 there were some things in the building that were not immediately identifiable,\u201d Burguan says. \u201cAs a result of that we do have some bomb techs on site \u2026 we do not know if they were brought in by the suspects \u2026 just things that as our teams were moving through said \u2018that needs to be looked at a little more closely.\u2019\u201d \u201cI do not have any information that any children were involved,\u201d Burguan says when asked about possible patients at the treatment center developmental disability center. \u201cThey were dressed in a way that indicated they were prepared,\u201d Burguan says of the suspects, after a question about reports that they were wearing body armor. \u201cThey had \u2026 long guns, not handguns,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a meeting to like a luncthime gathering, maybe for the holidays \u2026 it\u2019s my understanding that most of the people that were wounded, most of the victims, were all centrally located in the facility.\u201d An FBI spokesman takes the microphone briefly, saying agents are on hand \u201cessentially to assure that all the wounded are extracted,\u201d and make sure that the people are safe. \u201cI will tell you right now we do not know if this is a terrorist incident,\u201d he says. \u201cWe do not have any identification of who these suspects are,\u201d Burguan concludes, saying that officers continue tos sweep through the area in search of victims and suspects. \u201cThat search is still ongoing,\u201d Sheriff John McMahon continues. He says that police are working with the school district, coordinating with the city\u2019s board of supervisors. \u201cWe will work together to investigate this case once the scene is secure.\u201d The San Bernardino sherrif\u2019s department is holding a press conference. County chief Jarrod Burguan begins. \u201cThis originally started off at 11 this morning, we received a call at the Inland Regional center.\u201d He says officers responded quickly and they had a \u201cmassive\u201d regional response as the scope of the shooting became clear. What we have so far is information to the effect that up to three people had entered the building and opened fire on the people in the building. We have preliminary numbers of upwards of 14 people that are dead and up to 14 people that are injured. At least 10 people total were injured and are being treated at area hospitals, county officials say. Loma Linda Medical Center has four patients so far, Arrowhead Regional Medical Center has six; spokespeople for both have said they expect more. Schools throughout the San Bernardino area, more than 70 in the district, have been locked down as a precaution, the officials have added. Father Terry Pettit recounts the text his daughter sent inside the Inland Regional Center when the shooting began: \u201c\u2018Shooting at my work. People shot. In the office waiting for cops. Pray for us. I am locked in an office.\u2019\u201d Barack Obama has remarked on the shooting during a previously planned interview with CBS News, saying: \u201cIt does appear that there are going to be some casualties, and obviously our hearts go out to the victims and the families.\u201d He continued: \u201cWe have a pattern now of mass shootings in this country which has no parallel anywhere in the world.\u201d Obama went on to say that \u201cthere are steps\u201d that Congress can take to reduce gun violence in the US, even if the government cannot eliminate shootings entirely. The US can \u201ctake [steps] to improve the odds that they don\u2019t happen as frequently,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should never think that this is something that just happens in the ordinary course of events.\u201d He added that the FBI are on the scene, which the agency has itself reported. There are \u201cpossibly 12\u201d fatalities, an official at the San Bernardino county sheriff\u2019s office has told my colleague Nicky Woolf. Asked to elaborate, the official said: \u201cthat\u2019s all we\u2019ve got\u201d. San Bernardino police chief Jarrod Burguan will give a press conference within the next half hour. Linda Loma Medical Center has confirmed four adult patients are being treated, and a spokesperson there said she expects more. President Obama has reiterated that there are too many shooting incidents in the US, commenting during an interview with CBS News filmed within the last hour. The event where the shooting began was intended to honor county officials, witnesses have told ABC\u2019s Marc Brown. \u201cIt\u2019s a great agency and I don\u2019t know why somebody would want to do this,\u201d center worker Brandon Hunt said. Police and tactical units are still spreading around the area in search for as many as three gunmen. Police are taking witnesses away from the scene on school buses to an undisclosed \u201csecure\u201d location in order to interview them about the shooting. Meanwhile police are locking down public centers throughout the San Bernardino area, NBC\u2019s Gadi Schwartz tweets, including the Waterman Mall. \u201cEnough is enough,\u201d Democrat representative Nancy Pelosi has said in a statement about the San Bernardino shooting. She adds that Congress has \u201ca moral responsibility\u201d to act on gun violence. Today, yet another American community is reeling from the horror of gun violence. Our thoughts and prayers are with the people of San Bernardino. As the families of the victims grieve and the survivors focus on healing, the entire American family mourns. \u201cGun violence is a crisis of epidemic proportions in our nation. Congress has a moral responsibility to vote on common sense measures to prevent the daily agony of gun violence in communities across America. Enough is enough.\u201d Congress last voted on gun control measures in April 2013, several months after a gunman killed 26 people, including 20 children, in Sandy Hook, Connecticut. Senate Democrats were unable to secure the votes to override a filibuster, and the bill to close loopholes for background checks never reached the House for a vote. \u201cMultiple shooters\u201d targeted a function in the conference center, Sergeant Vicki Cervantes has told an ABC7 reporter. The Inland Regional Center hosted \u201csome kind of function today, an event, and during that event is when multiple shooters came in and just started shooting,\u201d Cervantes said. She confirmed that police have heard a report that \u201cat least one of the shooters may have left in a black SUV from the location. We were told that but that\u2019s the only information I have on that.\u201d Cervantes declined to give any numbers on victims, saying that officers were now \u201ctrying to remove all of the victims and witnesses from the building so we can take them to a secure location to be interviewed. \u201cThere are multiple casualties and there are confirmed fatalities.\u201d At least seven people have been injured, NBC reporter Marin Austin tweets from the Loma Linda Health center, one of several area hospitals that is preparing to receive patients. Yvette Cabrera, reporting for the Guardian from San Bernardino, sends some background on the Inland Regional Center: The center is one of 21 nonprofit agencies throughout California funded by the state Department of Developmental services. The agencies are charged with serving children and adults with developmental disabilities such as autism and cerebral palsy, and have been forced to slash services to clients over the last decade due to cuts in state funding during the economic downturn. This is a closer look at the location of the Inland Regional Center, where the shooting took place: Lieutenant Rich Lawhead has confirmed to a local NBC station that there are fatalities, but did not say how many people may have been shot or killed. He also declined to confirm reports that the suspect or suspects may have worn body armor. Reporters for local NBC4 have said they saw three people dead at the scene, and local ABC7 has cited witnesses as saying as many as 12 have died. Police have not given any official numbers. Police are looking for suspects who may have fled the scene in an SUV, an official at the San Bernardino County Sheriff\u2019s Department has confirmed to the Guardian. The official said that law enforcement officers are acting on intelligence that three suspects were seen fleeing the scene in an SUV vehicle. The official said the information was \u201cintelligence received by the command post\u201d set-up by San Bernardino Police, which is actively pursuing the lead. They said they had no current information about the color of the vehicle or description of the suspects and the radius of the secure perimeter set-up around the center remains unchanged. They have shut down several roadways in the area. President Barack Obama has been briefed on the shooting by homeland security adviser Lisa Monaco, the AP reports. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has already commented on the shooting, tweeting: Republican candidate Donald Trump has also tweeted about the shooting: Several hospitals are on standby for patients, a spokesperson for the Loma Linda Medical Center has told the Guardian. Police have moved reporters away from the Center but continue to close in on the building, with tactical teams and explosives technicians going room to room in the search for civilians and suspects. Photographer Micah Escamilla has overheard a police officer say: \u201cAll we can tell you is it\u2019s pretty bad.\u201d She\u2019s also filmed evacuations. San Bernardino police believe the suspect or suspects are well armed and possibly wearing body armor, a spokesperson has told the LA Times, in line with accounts heard by local reporters. Sergeant Vicky Cervantes told reporters that officers are going door to door. \u201cIt\u2019s a very active scene,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very fluid.\u201d Araksya Karapetyan of the local Fox affiliate has heard similar accounts. Local ABC7 has spoken with a man who\u2019s wife was in the center when the shooting began, and who managed to escape the building. \u201cThey locked themselves in her office. They seen bodies on the floor,\u201d Aguilera said, adding that his wife saw ambulances taking people out of the building on stretchers. Bomb technicians have arrived and are working with police to clear the buildings, and accounts from inside the office complex are trickling out through loved ones and cellphones. One woman texted her father, CBS news reported, with a message that read: \u201cPeople shot. In the office waiting for cops. Pray for us. I\u2019m locked in an office.\u201d The nearby Loma Linda University Hospital and Arrowhead Regional Medical Center have told the Desert Sun and other outlets that they are preparing to receive patients. A worker at the Inland Regional Center has spoken with the Guardian\u2019s Ryan Felton. She provides some background on the center. Nancy Lungren, assistant director of communications for the California department of developmental services, said the Inland Regional Center is one of 21 facilities in the state that help coordinate services and support people with developmental disabilities, like autism and cerebral palsy. \u201cAnd it can make all the difference,\u201d Lungren told the Guardian, adding: \u201cThey try to keep them in a community, living at home or living in an apartment.\u201d Heavily armed officers continue to gather and set up stations around the large complex, where more than 600 people usually work. San Bernardino police have warned emphatically on Facebook that the area is \u201cvery active\u201d and should be avoided. Live footage of the scene shows continued evacuations and police coordinating, and local reporters say that teams are working to clear the complex\u2019s buildings room by room. Police have asked local TV affiliates not to broadcast close footage of the Inland Regional Center, which dozens of officers from various departments have formed a perimeter around. Police are responding to an \u201cactive shooter\u201d in San Bernardino, California, reporting \u201cone to three possible suspects\u201d and \u201cmultiple victims\u201d. The sheriff\u2019s department, fire units and a Swat team have all responded to the scene and are trying to lock down the area around the Inland Regional Center, a nonprofit that helps people with developmental disabilities. Police have warned residents to stay away from the nearby golf course and the area of Orange Show Road and Waterman Avenue. Live footage of the scene shows dozens of people evacuating from the area under police guidance, as well as some people, their conditions unclear, taken on stretchers toward emergency vehicles. The fire department tweeted that they have had reports of as many as 20 victims, but authorities have not confirmed any reports of suspects, fatalities or injuries.",

The marvellous thing about this live blog is you rarely wonder for long. For that I\u2019m insanely grateful.</p> <p>The bill makes technical adjustments. It enables, for instance, Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) to publish a public notice on its website rather than having to publish a notice in a newspaper. It also amends the composition and appointment process of the FSANZ board.</p> <p>Labor isn\u2019t happy with the government\u2019s proposal on the board and will seek to amend it. According to a Labor man, the government proposal significantly weakens the appointment criteria to the board of FSANZ, exposing the board to risk of capture by interest groups. The minister is able to appoint seven members of the 11 member board, plus the chairperson. The New Zealand minister may appoint three members of the board. The CEO (appointed by the board) is also a member of the board. The bill prescribes minimum numbers of appointments by categories of expertise and removes the requirement that the board must include an appointment by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC).</p> <p>Bottom line? Too much ministerial discretion over the appointments in Labor\u2019s estimation.</p> <p>Given the events of the morning, backflips, amendments, amendments on amendments, hand shakes, grimaces \u2013 all part of the predictable end of year race to the door \u2013 we\u2019ll watch this space.</p> <p>The hour of glower, it cometh.

She noted Turnbull\u2019s \u201cbiggest mistake\u201d was raising the spectre of a GST increase so close to Christmas when voters were concerned with cost of living pressures. She also said the ALP had released 50 policies over 2015 (which readers with long memories will know Shorten dubbed the \u201cyear of ideas\u201d).</p> <p>She ended thus.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s been a year where the caucus has shown loyalty, discipline and unity of purpose.

He\u2019s been underwhelmed by the Turnbull commitments. But he\u2019s not proposing anything different when it comes to protecting the diesel fuel rebate.</p> <p>You know you are not exactly in cut through political territory when the response to this question .. </p> <p><em>Q: Can I ask you about some of the specifics that have come from Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s intervention in Paris \u2013 one is that the government has opted out of signing an international agreement to phaseout fossil fuel subsidies. How do you feel about that decision by the government? </em></p> <p><em>... </em>is<em> ...</em></p> <p><strong>Bill Shorten:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I can see both sides of that argument.</p> </blockquote> <p>Shorten went on to say he supported keeping the diesel fuel rebate.</p> <p>But ..</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The question is Australia pretending to do climate change reform, or is it fair dinkum? This conference is about setting out the global action on climate change from 2020 onwards, post the Kyoto conference goals. And yet, today the Australian government has fronted up and announced that they are going to implement the second stage of the Kyoto goals and Labor had announced that three years ago. My point is, leave aside the technicalities, Australia needs to be acting on climate change, gaining some of the investment opportunities and job opportunities that come with that, and we need to pull our weight. Having seen what other countries are doing, I am not convinced that Malcolm Turnbull is on the right track by keeping Tony Abbott\u2019s policies. </p> </blockquote> <p>Points for persistence.</p> <p><em>Q: But just to clarify on that one on phasing out fossil fuel subsidies, the government are saying it will not do that and that would endanger the diesel rebate among others, you are with the government on that?</em></p> <p><strong>Bill Shorten:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I don\u2019t think when you look at all the policies, I think there are other ways to achieve meaningful change on climate and that\u2019s why we have committed that by 2050 we believe Australia can be a net zero emitter of carbon pollution. We believe that we should be guided by Climate Change Authority policies which keep temperature rises within 2 degrees increase and that\u2019s why Mark Butler will be consulting with industry, with community on the Climate Change Authority\u2019s proposals. The Climate Change Authority was set up to be an independent body, it was set up to do the best practice research. Ever since they have made a recommendation on what policies should be in Australia for the long term, the Liberals in power have studiously ignored it. We won\u2019t ignore the best science. People can vote for Labor in the complete assurance that we are backing the science and that we are not interested in the short-term politics.</p> </blockquote> <p>Good we cleared that up.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-565ce29be4b0cf03a46245f0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-12-01T00:01:24.770Z\">12.01am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In the spirit of this timely prompt from <strong>Zac Spitzer </strong>...</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/zackster/statuses/671469401485406209\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Still waiting for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/murpharoo\">@murpharoo</a> to mention &quot;what a time it is to be alive&quot; over on the live blog</p>&mdash; Zac Spitzer (@zackster) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zackster/status/671469401485406209\">November 30, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>... let me share this quite marvellous opening of the prime minister\u2019s press conference in Paris overnight.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Hi, I\u2019m Malcolm Turnbull and I\u2019m here with Greg Hunt and we are here in Paris in a spirit of realistic optimism and commitment to ensuring that we have a global agreement.</p> </blockquote> <p>Realistic optimism could be the new excitement.</p> <p>Give it time. <br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-12-01T00:12:42.295Z\">at 12.12am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-565ce18fe4b037ebb2b00035\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-11-30T23:55:56.550Z\">11.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Sorry!

She\u2019s conducting them in a spirit I\u2019d call end-of-lease cleaning.</p> <p>As well as reassuring colleagues that Turnbull on climate policy is contained in a locked box called the cabinet and partyroom mandate, she\u2019s also out hosing down <strong>Peter Hartcher\u2019s</strong> latest instalment for Fairfax chronicling the demise of the Abbott government. <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/interactive/2015/Shirtfronted/PartTwoPeta.html\">Today\u2019s Hartcher instalment</a> can be summed up at <strong>Peta Credlin</strong> is/was wicked, with copious anecdotes underscoring the wickedness.</p> <p>It is truly amazing how endless the appetite is in my parts for \u201cPeta is wicked\u201d content. I know <strong>Credlin</strong> was a chief of staff who fatally undermined her own boss by over-reaching and under-delivering in terms of sensible advice to him. Who doesn\u2019t know that? We were all here, and she made herself public enough for her failings and misjudgments to occur periodically in the public domain. It\u2019s not even the stuff of deep Canberra lore. You all saw her snarling in the advisers box, doing selfies on the floor of the UN, berating a minister on camera during an election campaign.</p> <p>But strangely I never seem to read a version of history that puts the blame where it actually lies, with the boss.</p> <p>Surely the story is that <strong>Tony Abbott</strong>, the occupant of the most powerful office in the land, allowed himself to be a sock puppet for reasons that remain hard to comprehend. Anyone who thinks there is no gender dimension to the way Credlin is judged \u2013 \u201cthat unbearable witch in the office\u201d \u2013 need only reflect on that point. Any power Credlin had was derived from Abbott\u2019s power. When he lost his power she lost her job.</p> <p>Anyway back to Bishop, who was a public critic of Credlin in the late Abbott period. In one of her interviews this morning she\u2019s noted that people can view recent history through their own prisms, but Australians have moved on. She\u2019d also like people to move on from Peta watch. She notes Credlin no longer has a job. It would be good if people in that position could be permitted to get on with their lives, she says.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-11-30T23:31:12.554Z\">at 11.31pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-565cbe4ae4b0fd56932e3054\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-11-30T21:33:12.681Z\">9.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Interesting that <strong>Julie Bishop</strong> is trying to convey the impression nothing changes on the target for five years. I strongly suspect Turnbull\u2019s timetable for iterations on the climate policy is much sooner than that \u2013 after the next election, assuming of course he wins in 2016. Turnbull has been flagging the use of international permits for some time (a practice considered a thought crime in the Abbott period) and I wouldn\u2019t see that as the end of the tinkering. Key people around Turnbull suggest the current deficiencies can be fixed after the election.</p> <p>But worthy aspiration isn\u2019t concrete progress. He\u2019s going to have to drag the whole government with him.

Turnbull also said $1bn from Australia\u2019s existing aid budget will be directed towards projects that reduce emissions or help countries adapt, including the $200m already committed by the Abbott government to the Green Climate Fund.</p> </blockquote> <p>While Turnbull attempted to unfurl his wings in Paris, back at home, as I reported throughout yesterday on Politics Live, a group of Coalition MPs thought they might have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/30/signing-paris-fossil-fuel-statement-may-doom-diesel-rebate-coalition-mps-warn\">a little proxy war</a> on climate policy by insisting the government not sign a communique on fossil fuel subsidies that they argued might foreshadow the death of the diesel fuel rebate used by farmers and miners. The Minerals Council had stamped its well-shod foot.</p> <p>The end result is Australia won\u2019t sign that communique. Turnbull in Paris blamed a \u201cgratuitous\u201d communique reference to an IMF report to explain the non-signing. The environment minister, <strong>Greg Hunt,</strong> told the ABC the important story is that Australia will sign Kyoto2 \u2013 not the fate of a more obscure communique. \u201cWe actually have endorsed precisely that principle [winding back fossil fuel subsidies] in the G20. There was one element, a reference to an IMF report, that we didn\u2019t agree with. There are numerous communiques here that we are endorsing. Forests, clean energy, solar, Kyoto.\u201d</p> <p>Hunt is quite right, of course, on the substantive judgment. As I noted yesterday, this was a fight about two fifths of bugger all. But when it comes to issues such as climate change, the fractious internal politics are as they are.</p> <p>Apart from climate, last night the House of Representatives passed the citizenship revocation bill and the Senate passed, with Labor\u2019s support, legislation to scrap family tax benefit part B for couples whose youngest child has turned 13.</p> <p>The social services minister, <strong>Christian Porter,</strong> has hit the air waves this morning to say the government was willing to compromise to get the rest of its reforms through, provided it could also secure necessary savings.</p> <p>And last night the government\u2019s former Senate leader, <strong>Eric Abetz</strong>, was getting his cranky on, as you can detect from this sequence from <strong>Mike Bowers</strong>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"66ab5fbd3e41e5de9fe44c00f80e4738cd78d330\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66ab5fbd3e41e5de9fe44c00f80e4738cd78d330/0_0_4500_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Senator Eric Abetz questions the ABC\u2019s managing director, Mark Scott, at the Senate environment and communications committee on Monday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Senator Eric Abetz questions the ABC\u2019s managing director, Mark Scott, at the Senate environment and communications committee on Monday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Bowers for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8a5ab40dfcc5f09201e0f715f4dfce958cb7f5cb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a5ab40dfcc5f09201e0f715f4dfce958cb7f5cb/0_0_4500_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The ABC\u2019s managing director, Mark Scott, fronts the committee on Monday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The ABC\u2019s managing director, Mark Scott, fronts the committee on Monday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Bowers for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aebb9f75f73dba64f7607c0355a3391e687b2daf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aebb9f75f73dba64f7607c0355a3391e687b2daf/0_0_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The communications minister, Mitch Fifield, during the committee meeting on Monday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The communications minister, Mitch Fifield, during the committee meeting on Monday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Bowers for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I do love the communications minister\u2019s face in this shot.</p> <p>The ABC\u2019s managing director, <strong>Mark Scott,</strong> was in Canberra last night to make what we expect will be his last appearance before Senate estimates before he leaves the job.

          "bodyText": "Time to fold the Politics Live tent in anticipation of a lively day tomorrow. Malcolm Turnbull will be back in the country. How delightful that will be for him. Let\u2019s wrap today. The special minister of state Mal Brough is facing a sustained interrogation about his role in the Ashby affair, and today, the pressure showed in a couple of exchanges. It is notable that no senior minister or Liberal colleague rode to his defence in a matter of public importance debate about his conduct. I suspect Brough may have to explain tomorrow why he said 60 Minutes had edited a question that it really didn\u2019t edit very much at all, assuming transcripts are accurate. The government was firmly in get it in or chuck it out mode with various legislative proposals. It hit pause on its medicare safety net legislation and agreed to fundamentally rework separate legislation covering the VET sector in an effort to secure Labor\u2019s support. The senate will sit later tonight to try and pass the citizenship legislation \u2013 the one that revokes citizenship for dual nationals involved in terrorism. In Paris Malcolm Turnbull laid out Australia\u2019s global climate commitments. At home the foreign minister Julie Bishop took the fire hose to conservatives worried that Turnbull was about to unveil one world government by emphasising that the government had worked out a climate policy, and would stick to it. Stick to it. Over. And out. That\u2019s Tuesday. Thanks for your company. I will see you Wednesday. A senate inquiry in halal certification has found that \u201clacklustre\u201d regulation has given rise to scammers, and that the federal government needs to step in and set minimum standards for certification. In a report tabled in the Senate on Tuesday afternoon, the committee recommended that the federal government work with the halal certification industry on setting minimum standards which certifiers would be forced to comply with. The standards would be monitored by the Department of Agriculture. \u201cIt is an inescapable fact that halal certification is poorly understood, and arguably under-regulated, certainly in the domestic market,\u201d the former chairman of the committee, Sam Dastyari, said. \u201cThis compromises the integrity of the system and has allowed questionable conduct by certifiers of questionable expertise and questionable intent. \u201cLet me be clear: some certifiers are nothing more than scammers.\u201d The point of posting the full 60 Minutes transcript is to allow you to determine whether Mal Brough was on the money when he told parliament this afternoon: In relation to the 60 Minutes interview, what was put to air was not the full question. The relevant question for our purposes is question one in the 60 Minutes transcript. In a strict lawyerly sense this is true. The program did edit out \u201cUm why then also did you assis, seek, well [plane noise]\u201d. But if this transcript is accurate, I think the substance of the question was, in fact broadcast. Just another piece in our Brough in the rough puzzle. I\u2019m indebted to my colleague Daniel Hurst for securing the transcript in full. 60 Minutes has released the full transcript now of its interview with Mal Brough. I\u2019ll post it in full. Q: Um why then also did you um assis, seek well, [plane noise] did you ask James Ashby to procure um copies of Peter Slipper\u2019s diary for for you? M: [10:32:19] Yes I did. Q: Why did you do that? M: [10:32:22] Because I believed Peter Slipper had committed a crime. I believed he was defrauding the Commonwealth and the courts have\u2026 Q: [10:32:26] When did you become the police? M: [10:32:27] \u2026 and the, and the courts have fundamentally [plane noise] have actually now proven that to be the case. Q: [10:32:33] When did you become the police? M: [10:32:35] Well Liz if you don\u2019t think it\u2019s right, if you believe someone\u2019s defrauding someone [noise still] and you have the capacity to uncover that\u2026 Q: [10:32:43] Why didn\u2019t you go to the police? M: [10:32:44] [plane louder] I had no evidence. Q: Why didn\u2019t you ask them to investigate? Why did you get James Ashby and his ah colleague to do ah your work for you? M: [10:32:53] Well Liz the fact is that they had been asked via many different media outlets to have the Commonwealth investigate and many people had asked for where Mr Slipper was and why he was in places and we couldn\u2019t get the answers Q: [10:33:10] So you you decided that it would be appropriate to ah surreptitiously ah procure that information. M: Yeah that\u2019s your call. Q: [10:33:20] Do you feel good about that? M: Um\u2026 Q: Is that the right thing to do? M: [10:33:24] Ah I felt that Mr Slipper had for a very long time done the wrong thing in, in a criminals action and that has proven to be true in a court of law. Q: [10:33:33] Was that the right thing to secretly\u2026 M: Well that\u2019s .. Q: \u2026 get copies of his diary? M: [10:33:36] Liz that\u2019s for others to judge. You can judge and [over talk]. Q: [10:33:39] You believe it was the right thing to do. M: [10:33:40] Well I\u2019ll let others to judge that. Q: [10:33:41] You believe it\u2019s the right thing to do? M: I will let others judge that. Q: [10:33:44] Well you did it, does that mean you still believe it was the right thing to do? M: [10:33:48] I will let others judge that. Q: Would you have done it to Tony Abbott who\u2019s had to repay more than ten thousand dollars in travel allowances? Would you have asked for copies of his diary secretly? Would you have done that to Barnaby Joyce? M: [10:34:01] See it\u2019s interesting how we like to draw these analogies when the reality is that one person has been found, found by a court of law to have actually altered documents to create a profit for themselves at the cost of the Commonwealth. No one Q: [10:34:16] If you, if if you .. M: Liz\u2026 Q: \u2026 thought, if you thought\u2026 M: \u2026 no one has\u2026 Q: \u2026 Tony Abbott had been misusing his\u2026 M: [10:34:20] \u2026 Liz no one has \u2026 Q: \u2026 travel allowance, would you have asked a member of his staff to \u2026 M: [10:34:23] \u2026 Liz no one .. Q: \u2026 surreptitiously get a copy of his diary\u2026 M: [10:34:26] Liz no one .. Q: \u2026 would you have done that? M: [10:34:27] Liz no one is making those suggestions and I think it\u2019s quite wrong of you to make that assumption. Q: [10:34:32] My point is that why would you do that to Peter Slipper in that manner and not do it to other? M: [10:34:39] Because Peter Slipper had been on the public record for year after year of doing things which could not be answered and ultimately the Commonwealth and the taxpayer has been paid and you know if don\u2019t, if we just want to turn a blind eye to these things, well that\u2019s a decision for you. Q: [10:34:58] My point is that you decided to become the police. M: [10:35:00] No I didn\u2019t decide to become the police, I decided to become a concerned\u2026 Q: You did the investigation. M: \u2026 a concerned individual. Q: [10:35:04] You did the investigation. You didn\u2019t go to the police with certain dates and concerns, you did the investigation yourself. M: [10:35:12] You can draw that conclusion. Q: Well you did. M: [10:35:14] Well you can draw that conclusion Liz, that\u2019s fine. Q: [10:35:17] Well is that appropriate? M: [10:35:17] Oh absolutely it\u2019s appropriate. Q: [10:35:20] You don\u2019t think for a minute that was out of order? M: No I don\u2019t believe that was out of order. Good grief. Lovely frame of Kenneth Branagh .. sorry Clive Palmer .. from our visiting picture editor, Jonny Weeks. Labor\u2019s Terri Butler is picking up the friendless point. Why no Liberals? Why no ministers? Why Nationals? She thinks she can hear the distant sound of a bus, and suspects someone might be about to be thrown under one. Almost like the special minister of state is a bit friendless. It is mildly interesting that its fallen to the Nationals to defend Brough in this MPI. I know we are under the Truss regime until the return of the prime minister tomorrow, but even still. Also notable in this MPI is the lack of any specific defence by government speakers of the special minister of state. I can still hear the boos the member for Fisher received on that cold morning ... This is Palmer, weaving a midly elaborate tale of woe, which I don\u2019t think contains any significant new facts. He\u2019s harking back to a big internal barney over the merger of the Liberal and National parties in Queensland. Brough wanted to be president. He didn\u2019t end up as president. There was foot stamping and so on. Hard to see a direct connection to the specific matters currently in dispute. Clive Palmer is on his feet. He appears determined to bring a Shakespearean affect to his contribution in the MPI. There is much pointing skyward. Looks like 60 Minutes isn\u2019t taking its representation by Brough in question time today lying down. Darren Chester is defending Brough for the government. While we have a nation building program, they [Labor] have a gutter building program. Chester says listening to the party of Eddie Obeid and Craig Thomson talk about integrity is way rich, like hearing a lecture on fidelity from Tiger Woods. Couple more. Dreyfus, continuing the contribution in the MPI, says there\u2019s no way on earth Brough has been exonerated in any court proceedings. He was not the focus of the litigation. He was only lurking in the shadows. Question time in one frame. Here\u2019s the matter of public importance. Dreyfus opens subtly. It is past time for the special minister of state to go. (Yes, that was a small joke.) Further questions have been placed on the notice paper. Stay tuned for whatever the Palmer theatrics will be. Dreyfus asks now about a story in the Australian this morning, quoting James Ashby, that reports he had a document that would show it was Queensland Liberal MP and frontbencher Wyatt Roy who had told him he should copy the Slipper diary. Is this becoming conduct? Mal Brough I am aware of the media reports and I have nothing further to add. A Dorothy Dixer allowing the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, to conclude the CPSU is wrecking Christmas. Then .. . Dreyfus refers to the text correspondence between himself and Ashby. If he wasn\u2019t asking for the diary, what on earth is the parliament to think he was asking for? Mal Brough Mr Speaker, despite the best efforts of the opposition, they have not put one thing forward that was not already in the federal court, that has been dealt with by the federal court. I stand by all of my actions as being entirely appropriate and entirely honest. Dreyfus: Q: My question is to the special minister of state. I refer to the minister\u2019s previous answers. I refer to comments made by James Ashby in today\u2019s Australian: \u2018I went home and pulled a copy of the diary out of my cupboard, took pictures of the relevant dates and sent them to Mal. He couldn\u2019t read them and texted me and asked if I could send them again.\u2019 Did the minister receive those unauthorised copies of the former Speaker\u2019s diary? Is conduct of this nature consistent with the standard this government applies to the minister\u2019s portfolio. Mal Brough The question is \u2013 did I receive any further correspondence of any kind from Mr Ashby? The answer is no. Call it whatever you like. I say to the shadow attorney general I refer to him to a radio interview today on 2GB between Alan Jones and Mr James Ashby where Mr Jones asked: \u2018Did Mal Brough ever ask you for copies of Slipper\u2019s diary?\u2019 No. Dreyfus: Q: My question is again to the special minister of state. Yesterday and today the minister has referred to paragraphs 122-124 of the full federal court\u2019s judgment in the matter of Ashby and Slipper. Paragraph 124 states that the minister was: \u2018The recipient of copies of some of Slipper\u2019s diary entries.\u2019 Given the judgment, the minister mistakenly clings to as some sort of defence, finds he receives copies of the Speaker\u2019s official diary, isn\u2019t it time the minister resigned? Brough, really irritated now. A truly remarkable statement from a QC, \u201cclinging\u201d to the judgment of the full bench. Did you read the rest of that paragraph which said there was nothing inappropriate about me having any diary notes or has that slipped your memory? (So, I had the diary notes, but that\u2019s OK?) Dreyfus: Q: My question is to the special minister of state. I refer to the minister\u2019s previous answer. Isn\u2019t it true that the federal court judgment was handed down before the minister admitted on national television to procuring copies of the former Speaker\u2019s official diary? By claiming the judgment exonerated him, hasn\u2019t the minister misled the parliament? Mal Brough: I have two things for the member. In relation to the 60 Minutes interview, what was put to air was not the full question. He then reads out the section of the judgment he just read out a moment ago. Brough\u2019s irritation shows in his final flourish. Do go on in your year of ideas. Dreyfus: Q: My question is again to the special minister of state. If the federal court judgment found that the minister acted appropriately, why did the Australian federal police raid his home? The Speaker, Tony Smith, rules that one out of order on the basis that it requires the minister to answer for someone else, namely the AFP. This gives me a moment for reflection. Smith has done a very good job with these Brough questions thus far \u2013 he\u2019s played the straightest of straight bats. Imagine Madam Speaker permitting a rolling interrogation like the one we\u2019ve seen over the past few days? The horror. The horror. Dreyfus again. Q: My question is to the special minister of state. On Thursday last week during question time the minister said: \u2018I refer you to the findings of the full bench of the federal court which dealt with all of the evidence put before it and found entirely that I acted appropriately.\u2019 I have read that judgment from beginning to end, including paragraphs 122-124. Can the minister name the paragraph which he finds acted appropriately? If there is not one, hasn\u2019t the minister misled the parliament? Special minister of state, Mal Brough This is what the full bench of the federal court judgment says. \u2018We are of the opinion that there was no basis for the primary judge to conclude that Brough was part of any combination with anyone to the commencement of these proceedings with the predominant purpose of damaging Slipper in the way alleged, or at all.\u2019 Furthermore, I conclude by continuing with the findings of the full bench of the federal court: \u2018Despite Brough\u2019s hesitation at seeing Ashby, he did so and referred him to Russell QC. There is absolutely nothing untoward about these matters.\u2019 After a Dorothy Dixer on mango exports, Dreyfus is back. Q: My question is to the minister for justice. Given the minister was informed of the Australian federal police\u2019s intention to execute a search warrant at the home of the special minister of state, did the minister or his office inform any of his ministerial colleagues, including but not limited to the prime minister, the attorney general, the special minister of state, other ministers or any of their respective offices? The justice minister, Michael Keenan. Thank you very much. After the warrants were executed, as I would normally do in a matter like this, I informed the prime minister\u2019s chief of staff and the attorney general as the cabinet minister in the portfolio. We are hitting the Brough in the rough segment of question time. Shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus. Q: My question is to the minister for justice. When was the minister for justice or his office first informed of the Australian federal police\u2019s intention to execute a search warrant at the home of the special minister of state? The justice minister, Michael Keenan. Thank you for the question. As is usual practice, the Australian federal police informed me prior to it being executed. Innovation minister, Christopher Pyne, digressing. They are always dealing with the big issues, aren\u2019t they? On the other side of the House, focusing on my tie is apparently the big issue for the shadow treasurer, apart from replacing the member for Fowler, the other issue he is concerned about is my tie. Is it a Hogwarts tie? (It isn\u2019t.) I got a pocket full of quarters/ And I\u2019m headed to the arcade/ I don\u2019t have a lot of money/ But I\u2019m bringing everything I made/ I got a callous on my finger/ And my shoulder\u2019s hurting too/ I\u2019m gonna eat \u2018em all up/ Just as soon as they turn blue \u2018Cause I got Pac-Man fever \u2013 (Pac-Man fever) It\u2019s driving me crazy \u2013 (Driving me crazy) I got Pac-Man Fever \u2013 (Pac-Man Fever) I\u2019m going out of my mind \u2013 (Going out of my mind) I got Pac-Man fever \u2013 (Pac-Man fever) I\u2019m going out of my mind \u2013 (Going out of my mind) Never a truer word. The Greens MP, Adam Bandt. Q: Will you commit here and now to retaining the Australian renewable energy agency and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and doubling their budgets? Scott Morrison says the government\u2019s policy remains unchanged. Then there is a retro gaming reference which might mean something to somebody. You never know. Morrison: The opposition and the Greens, when it comes to this issue, is like a Pacman going around gobbling up jobs, the economy and gobbling up the budget. You know what happens at the end of Pacman. It is game over and that is what it will be for the economy if you\u2019re ever let near it again. Labor is back linking the report to the GST. Q: I refer to the treasurer\u2019s previous answer. Given the treasurer just ruled out including the family home in the pension assets test by affirming the government\u2019s policy will not change, why won\u2019t he also rule out increasing the GST to 15% which will push up the price of everything for pensioners? Scott Morrison: The members opposite make reference to the goods and services tax. We are going back to where we were a few weeks ago, last week even. The government has no such proposal, has not put forward any such preferred option or set of options. What the government has done has responded to the request from states and territories who have raised the issue of the GST. On that report, my colleague, Shalailah Medhora. Including the family home in the pension asset test or allowing retirees to use its equity would help make Australia\u2019s taxation system more fair, and unlock the $926bn worth of home equity held by older Australians, a new report has found. Labor\u2019s Jenny Macklin has a question on a report from the Productivity Commission that I haven\u2019t had time to look at yet. Q: The Productivity Commission report released today recommends the family home be included in the pension assets test. Will the treasurer give pensioners certainty in their retirement by ruling out, including the family home, in the pension assets test? The treasurer, Scott Morrison: I note that the Productivity Commission report to which she refers to was a report to government, not from government. It was also a report that was initiated by the Productivity Commission not by the government. The government\u2019s policy on this issue is well-known. There is no change to the government\u2019s policy. Here we are. It being 2pm ... Labor opens on climate policy. The question is from Labor\u2019s deputy leader, Tanya Plibersek, to the foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop. Q: Yesterday the prime minister failed to mention the government\u2019s woefully inadequate 26 to 28% carbon pollution target even once in his speech to the climate conference in Paris. Is the government leaving room for a more ambitious target or, like the foreign minister, is the government saying one thing in the conference room in Paris and another thing entirely in the party room in Canberra? Bishop by way of retort feels Plibersek is prone to over-statements. We are hearing about Plibersek over-statements about Aneco Island. (Aneco? Forgive me, but I\u2019ve ever heard of this island. Pressing on.) Bishop: The island that she says has literally disappeared into the sea has in fact got a residence on it. It has got a beautiful and accessible beach getaway. You can rent a bungalow for $50 a night. It is in good condition, we\u2019re told. There are houses, lawns, gardens, there is a toilet block and there are picnic tables. It seems to me that when the deputy leader of the opposition makes a claim, people had better test it very carefully. The Senate has amended today\u2019s sitting hours. This is the government motion. I move\u2014That, on Tuesday, 1 December 2015: (a) the hours of meeting shall be 12.30 pm to adjournment; (b) any proposal pursuant to standing order 75 shall not be proceeded with; (c) the routine of business from not later than 7.20 pm, shall be government business order of the day no. 2 (Australian Citizenship Amendment (Allegiance to Australia) Bill 2015); (d) government business be called on after consideration of the bill listed in paragraph (c) and considered till not later than 9.30 pm today; and (e) the question for the adjournment of the Senate shall be proposed at 9.30 pm. So the red room sits til 9.30pm and citizenship is the priority, which is in line with the guidance I gave you all earlier today. Phew for that. Labor supported the extension of today\u2019s business, the Greens opposed it. Green senator Rachel Siewart: Yesterday we had five rearrangements of government business. How many other times is the business of the Senate going to be rearranged while the government makes up its mind on what it wants? Still no clarity on what happens for the rest of the week. Earlier today I wondered what the food standards bill was. The marvellous thing about this live blog is you rarely wonder for long. For that I\u2019m insanely grateful. The bill makes technical adjustments. It enables, for instance, Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) to publish a public notice on its website rather than having to publish a notice in a newspaper. It also amends the composition and appointment process of the FSANZ board. Labor isn\u2019t happy with the government\u2019s proposal on the board and will seek to amend it. According to a Labor man, the government proposal significantly weakens the appointment criteria to the board of FSANZ, exposing the board to risk of capture by interest groups. The minister is able to appoint seven members of the 11 member board, plus the chairperson. The New Zealand minister may appoint three members of the board. The CEO (appointed by the board) is also a member of the board. The bill prescribes minimum numbers of appointments by categories of expertise and removes the requirement that the board must include an appointment by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC). Bottom line? Too much ministerial discretion over the appointments in Labor\u2019s estimation. Given the events of the morning, backflips, amendments, amendments on amendments, hand shakes, grimaces \u2013 all part of the predictable end of year race to the door \u2013 we\u2019ll watch this space. The hour of glower, it cometh. Refresh the teapot. Here comes 2pm. Rightio, let\u2019s take stock. The government has just announced it will completely overhaul the loans scheme for private training courses from 2017 and in the meantime freeze payments to existing providers at current levels. This is part of last minute government amendments to its VET Fee-Help bill, which is first cab off the Senate rank this afternoon. To less freshly minted content. The government has pulled its medicare safety net legislation for now at least, having failed to come to agreed terms with various senators in the required time. Liberal senator Cory Bernardi has joined the chorus of Coalition folks with strong feelings that Islam is a problem, and anyone who thinks otherwise is likely an appeaser. Clive Palmer has taken to Twitter to say, \u201clook at moi\u201d at 3.30pm. This tease relates to the special minister of state, Mal Brough, who remains in the rough over his past dealings in the Ashby/Slipper saga of the last parliament. Malcolm Turnbull has delivered Australia\u2019s climate commitments to the Paris summit, including ratifying Kyoto2 and redirecting aid money to emissions reduction projections. Labor says meh to all that. Onwards. Sideways. Roundabout. There\u2019s a conspiracy against this summary quite clearly. Sorry, just before that summary. The government is about to announce it will amend its VET bill, which I mentioned earlier is first up on the Senate notice paper for consideration. I described this legislation earlier as not deeply controversial. Now, presumably, the controversy will evaporate entirely. This man must be stopped. Yes, yes. I will stop wisecracking and post a summary next. Meanwhile, the Nationals leader Warren Truss is intensifying his naked grab for power by delivering an infrastructure statement to a packed chamber. Standing room only. The Liberal senator Cory Bernardi is taking his turn in \u2018Islam: straight talk.\u2019 He\u2019s on Sky News now defending the western tradition and our way of life. Readers with me yesterday will know that various government types have been out sharing their feelings on radicalisation and extremism. Bernardi is somewhat late to this party. The South Australian senator is backing in the resources minister Josh Frydenberg\u2019s weekend criticism of the Grand Mufti. I salute him for it and commend him for it. If you really feel passionately you need to go in and say it. Bernardi also notes \u201cCaptain\u201d Andrew Hastie \u2013 one of the MPs out and about on this topic in the last 48 hours \u2013 has a lived experience in this. Which sounds a little like Hastie (a former SAS soldier who served in Afghanistan) may have been a participant in the crusades. Which of course he wasn\u2019t. But let\u2019s not sweat the hyperbowl. Bernardi, continuing: They are discussing what needs to be discussed. Their motivations are entirely pure. Bernardi is asked about the counter view \u2013 the view that inflaming the situation with idle water cooler chatter actually makes Australians less safe. Bernardi isn\u2019t buying that analysis. Appeasers have been around since Neville Chamberlain, he notes. [Ed: Possibly before that, even.] Apologies, I shouldn\u2019t assume you are across the detail of the now paused measure. The safety net legislation would have lowered the thresholds needed to access benefits for out-of-hospital services while capping the amount payable for individual services once these have been reached. Medical groups \u2013 including mental health practitioners, cancer specialists and IVF providers \u2013 were vociferous in their opposition. The concern was patients would be left with substantial out-of-pocket costs. I flagged earlier on today the government had pulled the Medicare safety net bill from the notice paper. The health minister, Sussan Ley, has just confirmed that measure is officially over and out, for now at least. The health minister: I am announcing today the government will be pausing discussions on the Medicare safety net measure while we develop our broader Medicare and primary care reform package. This is a good measure that aims to address significant inequities in a system failing to help the very people it\u2019s designed to protect \u2013 our most vulnerable patients with complex and costly medical needs. We have also had constructive discussions with both the Greens and crossbench in recent months about the need to address the current safety net failings. However, at the end of the day I was unwilling to compromise over the fundamental integrity of the policy\u2019s intention and design in favour of a quick political solution. The current measure will remain on the table while we continue to work with our parliamentary colleagues from all sides over the coming months on an agreeable solution as part of our broader discussions on Medicare and primary care reform. The red room will open today\u2019s proceedings shortly and has this agenda. Higher education support amendment (VET FEE-HELP reform) bill 2015 \u2013 resumption of second reading debate; Australian citizenship amendment (allegiance to Australia) bill 2015 \u2013 resumption of second reading debate; Food Standards Australia New Zealand amendment (forum on food regulation and other measures) bill 2015 \u2013 resumption of second reading debate; Labor 2013-14 budget savings (measures No 2) bill 2015 (subject to introduction and exemption from the bills cut-off order). The first bill is not deeply controversial. We expect it will pass. The second, citizenship, will also pass due to the agreement between the Coalition and Labor. I\u2019m not sure about food standards \u2013 I\u2019ll need to check that when time permits. That final bill is the one Daniel has just briefed us about. Double backflip. Hold the pike. Tidying up caucus. Labor has performed its second U-turn on Gillard-era higher education cuts in the past two years. The opposition caucus meeting decided this morning to support two elements of a bill the Coalition government has quaintly titled the \u201cLabor 2013-14 budget savings (measures No 2) bill 2015\u201d. Those who have been closely watching the university funding debate will remember the Gillard government proposed more than $2bn in savings from the higher ed sector \u2013 including an efficiency dividend \u2013 to help pay for the Gonski school funding reforms. But Labor did not legislate the budget measures before the 2013 election and Tony Abbott\u2019s newly elected Coalition failed to get Senate support for the changes. Labor resolved in December 2013 to oppose the Gillard budget measures on the basis that the Coalition was undermining the Gonski reforms, a charge led by the Labor senator Kim Carr. Now Labor has agreed to pass two elements: changes to the student start-up scholarships that are available to help people with the upfront costs of study: they are to be replaced with income-contingent loans that will need to be repaid after graduates start earning a decent income (saving the budget $920m over four years); changes to incentives for early repayment of Hecs-Help loans: the 10% discount for upfront payments of $500 or more is to be scrapped, as is the 5% voluntary repayment bonus ($200m). But it continues to oppose the other elements of the bill, most notably: adjusting university funding as if an efficiency dividend of 2% had been applied in 2014 and 1.25% in 2015 ($920m over four years). Labor is presenting its new stance as being in the context of its recently announced policy to increase university funding at a total cost to the budget of $14bn over a decade. Just before Daniel and caucus, the justice minister, Michael Keenan, has just refused to back comments from some on the conservative side of the Coalition who have called on the Muslim community in Australia to do more to fight radicalisation. Keenan, whose portfolio takes in responsibility for the Australian federal police, was careful to note that individuals are the problem, not whole chunks of society. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to constantly reassure the Muslim community in Australia that they are a valuable part of our community, and they are. We don\u2019t seek to target any group of Australians in any circumstances,\u201d he said. Readers may recall the Liberal backbencher and part-time UN Facebooker Craig Kelly stood in Parliament yesterday and said the \u201ctyranny of political correctness\u201d was holding the community back from having a frank discussion on the link between Islam and radicalisation. Daniel will have a jot more on caucus shortly but in the meantime, here\u2019s how the Liberal MP Craig Kelly views UN climate summits. UN CLIMATE TALKS - THE RITUAL 1. The Hopes 2. Last Chance 3. Time is Running out 4. The Circus 5. The Deadlock 6. The 5 minutes to midnight breakthrough 7. The cold light of day 8. And we\u2019ll all be back at another exotic location to do it all over again reall soon !! Not a great deal of realistic optimism to be seen here. My colleague Daniel Hurst is back from the Labor caucus briefing. Labor\u2019s deputy leader Tanya Plibersek took today\u2019s session give Shorten is in the other hemisphere. Plibersek told colleagues Malcolm Turnbull was in Paris with Tony Abbott\u2019s climate policy baggage. She noted Turnbull\u2019s \u201cbiggest mistake\u201d was raising the spectre of a GST increase so close to Christmas when voters were concerned with cost of living pressures. She also said the ALP had released 50 policies over 2015 (which readers with long memories will know Shorten dubbed the \u201cyear of ideas\u201d). She ended thus. It\u2019s been a year where the caucus has shown loyalty, discipline and unity of purpose. Bill\u2019s done a terrific job hunting down Tony Abbott and Joe Hockey, he\u2019ll now do the same job against Malcolm Turnbull. Readers with me yesterday will know the Labor leader Bill Shorten is in Paris as well. He\u2019s been underwhelmed by the Turnbull commitments. But he\u2019s not proposing anything different when it comes to protecting the diesel fuel rebate. You know you are not exactly in cut through political territory when the response to this question .. Q: Can I ask you about some of the specifics that have come from Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s intervention in Paris \u2013 one is that the government has opted out of signing an international agreement to phaseout fossil fuel subsidies. How do you feel about that decision by the government? ... is ... Bill Shorten: I can see both sides of that argument. Shorten went on to say he supported keeping the diesel fuel rebate. But .. The question is Australia pretending to do climate change reform, or is it fair dinkum? This conference is about setting out the global action on climate change from 2020 onwards, post the Kyoto conference goals. And yet, today the Australian government has fronted up and announced that they are going to implement the second stage of the Kyoto goals and Labor had announced that three years ago. My point is, leave aside the technicalities, Australia needs to be acting on climate change, gaining some of the investment opportunities and job opportunities that come with that, and we need to pull our weight. Having seen what other countries are doing, I am not convinced that Malcolm Turnbull is on the right track by keeping Tony Abbott\u2019s policies. Points for persistence. Q: But just to clarify on that one on phasing out fossil fuel subsidies, the government are saying it will not do that and that would endanger the diesel rebate among others, you are with the government on that? Bill Shorten: I don\u2019t think when you look at all the policies, I think there are other ways to achieve meaningful change on climate and that\u2019s why we have committed that by 2050 we believe Australia can be a net zero emitter of carbon pollution. We believe that we should be guided by Climate Change Authority policies which keep temperature rises within 2 degrees increase and that\u2019s why Mark Butler will be consulting with industry, with community on the Climate Change Authority\u2019s proposals. The Climate Change Authority was set up to be an independent body, it was set up to do the best practice research. Ever since they have made a recommendation on what policies should be in Australia for the long term, the Liberals in power have studiously ignored it. We won\u2019t ignore the best science. People can vote for Labor in the complete assurance that we are backing the science and that we are not interested in the short-term politics. Good we cleared that up. In the spirit of this timely prompt from Zac Spitzer ... ... let me share this quite marvellous opening of the prime minister\u2019s press conference in Paris overnight. Hi, I\u2019m Malcolm Turnbull and I\u2019m here with Greg Hunt and we are here in Paris in a spirit of realistic optimism and commitment to ensuring that we have a global agreement. Realistic optimism could be the new excitement. Give it time. Sorry! I\u2019m spending entirely too much time on social media with people who think only progressive women face gender stereotyping. This choose-your-own-facts world really must be a lot of fun. Need to get back to business. The Labor caucus briefing is under way now. Back to the other hemisphere, it\u2019s interesting that the US president, Barack Obama, has met the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, on the sidelines of the climate summit in Paris. The two also held a very public meeting in a hotel foyer at the G20, a public display of \u201cthaw\u201d in an effort to get to a political solution in Syria. The second meeting overnight in Paris follows the downing of a Russian jet by Turkey last week, a development with the potential to derail the nascent diplomatic progress made at the G20. Obama reportedly expressed regret about that incident, and urged Putin to turn his military force against Islamic State, not the enemies of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad. I\u2019ve just been told today\u2019s Coalition party room meeting was procedural only, just ticking legislation. The full discussion has been reserved for when the prime minister is back in the building tomorrow. Interesting development but, like all \u201clast-week-of-parliament\u201d developments, all things liable to change without notice. The word downstairs is that the government has pulled from the Senate the bill to amend the Medicare safety nets. The changes are worth $257m to the budget, and are due to commence on 1 January, so if they don\u2019t get through this week that\u2019s a small problem. Labor opposes the bill. The Medicare bill was not in the list of priority bills circulated yesterday in the context of a possible extension of sitting hours over the next few days. I flagged just before I don\u2019t know whether or not the government will press ahead with an extension of sitting hours, but there is some expectation the government will lodge a motion to extend sittings from 7.20pm to 10.30pm today. I mentioned first up the citizenship revocation bill passed the House last night. Perhaps an extension tonight (if it\u2019s forthcoming) will focus exclusively on passing that legislation. Lot of ifs in this post. When things firm up I\u2019ll let you know. Before going to the party room meeting, the Liberal MP Ewen Jones shaved off his Movember thatch with a couple of his closest camera-wielding friends hovering at the bathroom door. Which could be weird, except it was great. No pressure, Ewen. Thanks to Jonny Weeks for converting Mike\u2019s stills into a fun GIF. It being Tuesday, there will be party room meetings. I\u2019d like to tell you whether or not the sitting hours will be extended in order to drive through the last remaining government business but, sadly, I can\u2019t right now. First lady MP home \u2013 Liberal Fiona Scott. From Nats in Hats to Amazing Race. This morning the fit cohort of Australia\u2019s elected representatives (curse them) raced around the building. The winner was Liberal MP Andrew Laming, pictured below. Mr Bowers has been doing his rounds of the building. A couple of lovely sequences, including Nats in Hats. Bishop has done a round of interviews this morning. She\u2019s conducting them in a spirit I\u2019d call end-of-lease cleaning. As well as reassuring colleagues that Turnbull on climate policy is contained in a locked box called the cabinet and partyroom mandate, she\u2019s also out hosing down Peter Hartcher\u2019s latest instalment for Fairfax chronicling the demise of the Abbott government. Today\u2019s Hartcher instalment can be summed up at Peta Credlin is/was wicked, with copious anecdotes underscoring the wickedness. It is truly amazing how endless the appetite is in my parts for \u201cPeta is wicked\u201d content. I know Credlin was a chief of staff who fatally undermined her own boss by over-reaching and under-delivering in terms of sensible advice to him. Who doesn\u2019t know that? We were all here, and she made herself public enough for her failings and misjudgments to occur periodically in the public domain. It\u2019s not even the stuff of deep Canberra lore. You all saw her snarling in the advisers box, doing selfies on the floor of the UN, berating a minister on camera during an election campaign. But strangely I never seem to read a version of history that puts the blame where it actually lies, with the boss. Surely the story is that Tony Abbott, the occupant of the most powerful office in the land, allowed himself to be a sock puppet for reasons that remain hard to comprehend. Anyone who thinks there is no gender dimension to the way Credlin is judged \u2013 \u201cthat unbearable witch in the office\u201d \u2013 need only reflect on that point. Any power Credlin had was derived from Abbott\u2019s power. When he lost his power she lost her job. Anyway back to Bishop, who was a public critic of Credlin in the late Abbott period. In one of her interviews this morning she\u2019s noted that people can view recent history through their own prisms, but Australians have moved on. She\u2019d also like people to move on from Peta watch. She notes Credlin no longer has a job. It would be good if people in that position could be permitted to get on with their lives, she says. Interesting that Julie Bishop is trying to convey the impression nothing changes on the target for five years. I strongly suspect Turnbull\u2019s timetable for iterations on the climate policy is much sooner than that \u2013 after the next election, assuming of course he wins in 2016. Turnbull has been flagging the use of international permits for some time (a practice considered a thought crime in the Abbott period) and I wouldn\u2019t see that as the end of the tinkering. Key people around Turnbull suggest the current deficiencies can be fixed after the election. But worthy aspiration isn\u2019t concrete progress. He\u2019s going to have to drag the whole government with him. Given allies at home are busy battening down the hatches, all you can say on that point is good luck. We\u2019ve just published some analysis from Lenore Taylor on the Turnbull pledges. There\u2019s nice contrast in Lenore\u2019s piece between a constrained Turnbull and an unconstrained Justin Trudeau. [The Paris commitment] wasn\u2019t anywhere near big enough for Turnbull to stride to the lectern like Canada\u2019s new prime minister, Justin Trudeau, who declared: \u201cCanada is back, my friends. We\u2019re here to help.\u201d Tony Abbott and Trudeau\u2019s predecessor, Stephen Harper, combined in international forums to defeat pro-climate change motions but, unlike Trudeau, Turnbull does not yet have the comfort of his own election victory to forge his own policy path. You can read her analysis here. With bonus gravitas filter. The foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, is on the AM program on ABC radio and she\u2019s asked what happened with the fossil fuel communique. She says the issue (meaning the controversy) came to her late last week. Bishop says she had some concerns about the wording in the New Zealand-initiated communique but changes \u201ccouldn\u2019t be negotiated in time so we didn\u2019t sign up to it\u201d. She says Australia had already made a very similar commitment in the G20. She is also pressed on the conservative resistance to beefing up Australia\u2019s anaemic climate commitments. Bishop says the government has a settled policy on emissions reductions \u2013 a target of 26% to 28% % \u2013 and that is locked in until a review in five years. That is the cabinet agreement and the party room agreement. No one has a mandate to go beyond that until the review. But don\u2019t people have fears Turnbull will expand the envelope? Julie Bishop: People can have fears about all sorts of things.The reality is our target is 26 to 28%. Bishop is also asked whether the aid funding commitment is new money. No, it\u2019s not new money. Bonjour and welcome to the second day of politics in two hemispheres. It\u2019s delightful to have your company. While some of us were sleeping, Malcolm Turnbull delivered his contribution to the climate talks in Paris. As my colleague Lenore Taylor reports, Australia will ratify the second stage of the Kyoto protocol, a move that underlines Australia\u2019s change in attitude towards international climate talks but is unlikely to make any practical difference to reductions in emissions. Turnbull also said $1bn from Australia\u2019s existing aid budget will be directed towards projects that reduce emissions or help countries adapt, including the $200m already committed by the Abbott government to the Green Climate Fund. While Turnbull attempted to unfurl his wings in Paris, back at home, as I reported throughout yesterday on Politics Live, a group of Coalition MPs thought they might have a little proxy war on climate policy by insisting the government not sign a communique on fossil fuel subsidies that they argued might foreshadow the death of the diesel fuel rebate used by farmers and miners. The Minerals Council had stamped its well-shod foot. The end result is Australia won\u2019t sign that communique. Turnbull in Paris blamed a \u201cgratuitous\u201d communique reference to an IMF report to explain the non-signing. The environment minister, Greg Hunt, told the ABC the important story is that Australia will sign Kyoto2 \u2013 not the fate of a more obscure communique. \u201cWe actually have endorsed precisely that principle [winding back fossil fuel subsidies] in the G20. There was one element, a reference to an IMF report, that we didn\u2019t agree with. There are numerous communiques here that we are endorsing. Forests, clean energy, solar, Kyoto.\u201d Hunt is quite right, of course, on the substantive judgment. As I noted yesterday, this was a fight about two fifths of bugger all. But when it comes to issues such as climate change, the fractious internal politics are as they are. Apart from climate, last night the House of Representatives passed the citizenship revocation bill and the Senate passed, with Labor\u2019s support, legislation to scrap family tax benefit part B for couples whose youngest child has turned 13. The social services minister, Christian Porter, has hit the air waves this morning to say the government was willing to compromise to get the rest of its reforms through, provided it could also secure necessary savings. And last night the government\u2019s former Senate leader, Eric Abetz, was getting his cranky on, as you can detect from this sequence from Mike Bowers. I do love the communications minister\u2019s face in this shot. The ABC\u2019s managing director, Mark Scott, was in Canberra last night to make what we expect will be his last appearance before Senate estimates before he leaves the job. Abetz was displeased by a number of ABC transgressions, including coverage of same-sex marriage, and the performance of the Middle East correspondent, Sophie McNeill. Blah blah blah. Yadda yadda yadda. Outrage outrage outrage. You lucky ducks, of course, have a daily avenue to highlight my transgressions \u2013 you don\u2019t have to wait for estimates. The comments thread is open for your business. And we are up and at \u2019em on the Twits as well. I\u2019m @murpharoo, he\u2019s @mpbowers Strap on your parachute.

          "bodyText": "Malcolm Turnbull came to the Paris climate meeting with good intentions but no political room to do much to prove them. His big pledge \u2013 to ratify Kyoto 2 \u2013 was an almost perfect example of his dilemma. It did send a signal to the international community that Australia brings a new attitude to the international talks. The change isn\u2019t just a line from the government\u2019s spinners, it is acknowledged by veteran negotiators. But while it was heralded as a \u201cvery important symbol\u201d in Paris, at home it had to be sold to the Coalition party room on the basis that \u2013 because it would allow Australia to \u201ccarry over\u201d reductions from an earlier period \u2013 it would help meet our 2020 target without doing much at all. The promise won a smattering of applause in the auditorium, although the enthusiasm of the audience might also have been waning after five hours of three minute speeches by world leaders. But it wasn\u2019t anywhere near big enough for Turnbull to stride to the lectern like Canada\u2019s new prime minister Justin Trudeau who declared \u201cCanada is back, my friends. We\u2019re here to help.\u201d Tony Abbott and Trudeau\u2019s predecessor Stephen Harper combined in international forums to defeat pro-climate change motions, but unlike Trudeau Turnbull does not yet have the comfort of his own election victory to forge his own policy path. And so, despite the fact the government has just released figures showing it is already on track to meet the minimum 2020 target \u2013 a 5% reduction in emissions based on 2000 levels \u2013 Turnbull can\u2019t do the logical thing and announce he intends to achieve more. And despite the Australian government\u2019s strong push for other countries to review and ramp up their targets every five years, Turnbull would not explicitly say that\u2019s what the Australian government would also do, instead muttering something vague about the \u201cmood of the global community\u201d. And even though and more and more global leaders and institutions are calling for an internationally linked carbon price in Paris \u2013 like German chancellor Angela Merkel, French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, Trudeau, the World Bank (including its president Jim Yong Kim), the International Monetary Fund and scores of chief executives \u2013 Turnbull doesn\u2019t even utter the name of the policy he once believed in so firmly he lost his job over it. He has to choke out something about Direct Action being really very effective. A re-elected Turnbull government almost certainly would be open to a tougher target \u2013 especially after it allows the purchase of international permits when it reviews its policy in 2017, after the next federal election. It will have to find a better policy then too, unless it wants to be winding down its 2030 target while arguing that everybody else\u2019s should be increasing. And the state of the budget means Turnbull was unable to bring to Paris the other thing that gets noticed \u2013 big wads of money. Australia joined the US initiative for countries to double their spending on clean energy research and development \u2013 the details will come in the innovation statement \u2013 but the $1bn on climate financing will somehow be found from the already stretched international aid budget. Turnbull\u2019s reception in Paris wasn\u2019t so much about what he said or pledged, as the fact that he wasn\u2019t Tony Abbott.",

          "bodyText": "At the Copenhagen climate summit in 2009 world leaders arrived at the end and could not save it from failure. In Paris, 150 leaders came at the beginning and were confident of success. That is partly because the negotiators have reset what qualifies as a success \u2013 and not just to allow the leaders to pat themselves on the back. They decided that, counter-intuitively, they might achieve more by demanding less. But the new plan comes with a risk. For more than 20 years, the world has been struggling to tackle climate change, worried about the cost of acting but always knowing it would cost unthinkably more to leave the problem unattended. Now \u2013 in a deal to decide how far emissions are cut until 2030 \u2013 rather than horse-trading during the negotiations over what carbon cuts each country will offer, countries were allowed to pledge what they feel is a reasonable contribution to the accepted goal of limiting global warming to 2C. Those pledges are in. That in itself is a remarkable achievement and the job of the leaders in Paris was to give some momentum to the negotiations on the deal that will surround them. Leader after leader took to that task with passion in two simultaneous sessions on Monday that continued into the night to fit them all in. The US president, Barack Obama, came with a message of hope and urgency, saying climate change would \u201cdefine the contours of this century more dramatically than any other\u201d. The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, set out the big steps his country had taken since its intransigent stance in 2009. Canada\u2019s new premier, Justin Trudeau, declared that his country was \u201cback\u201d, in clear contrast to the less helpful attitude of his predecessor Stephen Harper. The leaders of small island states pleaded, as they always do, for the world to think about what it felt like to face inundation. The Paris attacks were used as a rallying point. \u201cThrough our presence here today we show we are stronger than the terrorists,\u201d the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, declared. Global leaders delivered the familiar warnings. \u201cA political moment like this may not come again,\u201d said the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon. But even though the mood was optimistic and the words were full of purpose, the attention of the 40,000 assembled officials and media drifted a bit when each leader got down to the details of exactly what their country was actually doing \u2013 even at the beginning when there were still plenty of them watching. And that\u2019s the danger. The pledges made so far will still result in global warming of at least 2.7 degrees, even if they are all met \u2013 much better than the 5C rise we might expect without action but still short of the 2C goal. Experience suggests there is a very big \u201cif\u201d, and negotiators have virtually given up on the idea that the pledges should be legally binding. Shirkers will face no real sanction, other than international opprobrium. And that means a system to check and report what each country does is critical. But the rules for monitoring remain unfinished. The plans to regularly review and ratchet up the pledges to contain global warming to 2C or lower are not finalised either and will be critical. Developing countries argue they still need more finance. Those details matter. Once the leaders are on their jets back home, sorting out the details will be the job of the same negotiators who have been talking about them for the past 21 years at scores and scores of these conferences. The same things will divide. The developed world will demand verifiable commitments from developing countries like China, India and Brazil \u2013 who over decades of talking have become, or are becoming, the world\u2019s major emitters. And the developing world will demand money to help deal with the climate crisis. A weak agreement could still be hailed a success in two weeks\u2019 time because the bar has been lowered and much of the work has already been done.

It\u2019s an opportunity to stand in solidarity with our oldest ally, just two weeks removed from the barbaric attacks there, and reaffirm our commitment to protect our people and our way of life from terrorist threats. It\u2019s also an opportunity for the world to stand as one and show that we will not be deterred from building a better future for our children.</p> <p>What makes this gathering different is that more than 180 nations have already submitted plans to reduce the harmful emissions that help cause climate change. And America\u2019s leadership is helping to drive this progress. In fact, our businesses and workers have shown that it\u2019s possible to make progress towards a low-carbon future while creating new jobs and growing the economy. Our economic output is at all-time highs, but our greenhouse gas emissions are down towards 20-year lows.</p> <p>So what we\u2019re trying to do in Paris is put in place a long-term framework for further emissions reductions - targets set by each nation, but transparent enough to be verified by other nations. And we\u2019ll work to mobilize support to help the most vulnerable countries expand clean energy and adapt to the effects of climate change we can no longer avoid.</p> <p>I\u2019m optimistic about what we can achieve - because I\u2019ve already seen America take incredible strides these past seven years.

Here\u2019s an excerpt:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is an opportunity to address inequality; for powerful people and nations to acknowledge that their environmental wellbeing, their security and sustainability, is dependent on the wellbeing, security and sustainability of others. To acknowledge our inter-dependence, and the strengths and vulnerabilities we share.</p> <p>If we \u201ccarry on as usual\u201d, there may not be another opportunity.</p> <p>The days of not understanding the disastrous human and environmental consequences of rampant consumerism and greed are gone. Our leaders can no longer claim not to know. If they don\u2019t take action they will be saying very clearly that they don\u2019t care.</p> <p>Should they grasp the opportunity, and develop a legally binding treaty to mitigate climate change, it will signal the end of the age of reckless consumption, exploitation and greed.</p> <p>But failing to grasp the nettle will send a direct message of contempt to poorer nations and people, who cannot afford the costs of mitigating the impacts of increasing temperatures. It will trigger unprecedented economic and refugee crises, and dramatically deepen global insecurity.</p> <p>It\u2019s a simple equation, really. Agree on mechanisms to enforce adherence to environmental justice, or consciously embrace injustice and add fuel to the fire of human division and pain.</p> <p>We know that the only answer is to reduce carbon emissions, and the only way we can do that is by reducing our dependency on carbon fuels.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-11-29T16:20:27.632Z\">at 4.20pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-565b1e86e4b0fbf505ff9353\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/emma-e-howard\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-11-29T15:53:57.780Z\">3.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>I\u2019ve been talking with actor and Greenpeace supporter Emma Thompson. \u201cUnfortunately we live in a world which is absolutely in the pockets of fossil fuel companies,\u201d she said as we walked through London.

If however, they listen to the words of millions all around the world: it is possible to reduce the level of emissions, it is possible to slow the rate of temperature change, it is possible to protect large parts fo the environment of this planet, then they will have done something useful. Our message today is to them: do what you are sent there to do.</p> </blockquote> <p>Videos to come shortly.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-11-29T14:23:01.074Z\">at 2.23pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-565afb1be4b03bf401a0be97\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/emma-e-howard\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-11-29T13:22:53.733Z\">1.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Cecelia Anim, president of the Royal College of Nursing, tells me: <br></p> <blockquote> <p>Climate change is one of the greatest challenges we face.

I\u2019ll update this post when I know exactly when and where along the march - there\u2019s a rally at 1pm at Millbank and speeches later at 2.45pm by parliament.</p> <p>Corbyn\u2019s attendance looks like a last-minute decision, given his name wasn\u2019t on lists of speakers even two days ago. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/28/cop21-carbon-capture-uk-climate-change-george-osborne\">According to my colleague <strong>Robin McKie</strong></a>, he will attack the Conservative party\u2019s leadership on climate change, following <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/24/the-9-green-policies-killed-off-by-tory-government\">a series of green policies being cancelled over the summer</a>, saying \u201cThere are no more hugs for the husky, instead it\u2019s a passionate embrace for the carbon polluters.\u201d </p> <p>It\u2019s the first time I can think of a leading Labour politician speaking at a big climate march - the most high profile politician <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/mar/07/time-to-act-climate-change-protest-london\">is usually Green party MP, Caroline Lucas</a>.</p> <p>Other speakers from 2.45pm include NUS vice-president, Piers Telemacque, and musician and activist Charlotte Church who is singing with a 12-piece choir.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-11-29T10:08:24.575Z\">at 10.08am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-565ac7f4e4b0fbf505ff92b4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-11-29T09:43:15.441Z\">9.43am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>People are gathering in Cape Town\u2019s Keizergracht Street.

But thousands of shoes have been left in the Place de la Republique as an installation instead, among them a pair with Pope Francis\u2019s name on and the the inscription <em>Laudato Si\u2019</em> (Praised be). </p> <p>Cardinal Turkson, seen as a potential future Pope, said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>All members of the Catholic community are warmly invited to offer their support in prayer, word and action. And we\u2019re inviting all the bishops and priests around the world to offer the celebration of the Eucharist, on 29 November, for a responsible and successful international conference and summit.

The voices of ordinary people are primarily heard in grassroots gatherings parallel to the summit, as well as in marches and protests, which in turn attract media coverage.</p> <p>Now the French government has decided to take away the loudest of these megaphones, claiming that securing marches would compromise its ability to secure the official summit zone where politicians will meet. <br></p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/20/paris-climate-talks-protesters-hollande-violence\">What\u2019s really at stake at the Paris climate conference now marches are banned | Naomi Klein</a> </p> </aside> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/26/quel-est-le-veritable-enjeu-de-la-conference-sur-le-climat-de-paris-maintenant-que-les-manifestations-sont-interdites-\">Quel est le v\u00e9ritable enjeu de la conf\u00e9rence sur le climat de Paris maintenant que les manifestations sont interdites ?</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-565ab326e4b0fbf505ff92a4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-11-29T08:14:20.745Z\">8.14am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Summary: Australia marches for climate action</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change\">Climate change</a> rallies rolled on across Australia on Sunday, following well attended protests in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/27/victorians-take-to-the-streets-to-demand-urgent-action-on-climate-change\">Melbourne on Friday</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/28/thousands-march-over-climate-change-in-brisbane-and-across-new-zealand\">Darwin and Brisbane on Saturday</a>.</p> <p>On Sunday, it was the turn of Sydney, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/canberra\">Canberra</a>, Adelaide, Hobart and Perth.</p> <p>Australia\u2019s climate-sensitive neighbours in the Pacific were a key focus for the climate change rally in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/sydney\">Sydney</a>, with representatives of communities from Pacific nations \u2013 including Tuvalu, Nauru, Kiribati and Tonga \u2013 prominent at the front of the march from the Domain to Circular Quay.</p> <p>More than 40,000 people braved Sydney\u2019s heat for the rally on Sunday afternoon, calling on Australia to play a lead role in brokering binding emissions targets for the world to keep global temperature rise below 2C, and to commit to greater domestic emissions cuts than the 26% to 28% the government is currently proposing.</p> <p>In Canberra, people brought their children to march with them from Parliament House to the tent embassy, near Old Parliament House.</p> <p>Police estimate about 3,000 people showed up, while protesters think the number was closer to 6,000</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/perth-news\">Perth</a> event started sombrely.

That threshold is estimated as a temperature rise of 2C above pre-industrial levels, and on current emissions trajectories <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/21/record-co2-emissions-committing-world-to-dangerous-climate-change\">we are heading for a rise of about 5C</a>.</p> <p>That may not sound like much, but the temperature difference between today\u2019s world and the last ice age was about 5C, so seemingly small changes in temperature can mean big differences for the Earth.</p> <h2>Will world leaders go to Paris?</h2> <p>Yes. The heads of state or government of more than 130 countries have already said they will come.

          "bodyText": "As the last of the day\u2019s climate marches get underway in the western reaches of North America, we will wrap up our live coverage of what has been a record-breaking day in global activism ahead of the COP21 talks in Paris tomorrow. More than 600,000 people have taken to the streets in 175 countries around the world to call for a strong deal in Paris that will see a swift transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy. Melbourne and London led the way, with 60,000 people and 50,000 people, respectively, joining marches. Figures including Thom Yorke, Emma Thompson, Charlotte Church and Jeremy Corbyn attended the London gathering. Pope Francis and Ban Ki-moon were among the people to donate 10,000 pairs of shoes to an installation in Paris to represent people who could not march because of orders imposed by authorities after the 13 November attacks. Protests in Paris turned violent, with police arresting around 200 people after clashes with anti-capitalists and anarchists. Some activists allegedly hurled candles and bouquets from memorials to victims of the 13 November attacks. Organisers of the climate marches have condemned the violence. Barack Obama boarded a flight to Paris, where he said he will reaffirm the US\u2019s support for France in the face of \u201cbarbaric attacks\u201d as well as forge a deal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and avert the worst ravages of climate change. Climate talks will go on until 11 December, amid optimism among negotiators that an effective agreement can be reached. Let\u2019s hope Paris can finish the year on a positive note. Climate events are now underway on the west coast, with people gathering in Los Angeles and Vancouver. There are tentative estimates of 25,000 people attending the climate march in Ottawa. Organisers expect more than 600,000 people worldwide have attended marches calling for fossil fuels to remain in the ground and for nations to shift to 100% renewable energy use. May Boeve, executive director of organiser 350.org, said: \u201cThe scale and diversity of today\u2019s events are astounding. Worldwide people are ready for the end of fossil fuels and the dawn of renewables. World leaders can no longer ignore this urgent call for action as the climate crisis continues to unfold. It is time for them to stand on the right side of history.\u201d The rather sedate gatherings taking place in the US and Canada are in contrast to the clashes between protestors and police seen in Paris earlier this week. French newspaper La Figaro has reported that some activists hurled objects from the memorial to those killed in the 13 November attacks at police. Candles and bouquets were launched in the direction of police, the newspaper said. Others responded, as \u201cmany people managed to form a human chain around the memorial to protect flowers and candles\u201d, La Figaro reported (in French). 350.org, one of the major organisers of the climate marches, said that the clashes had violated a \u201cnonviolent pledge that every group involved in the climate coalition here in France has agreed to.\u201d It has distanced itself from violence but said it opposes any attempt to \u201cunnecessarily clamp down on civil liberties.\u201d The official climate march in Paris was banned due to security concerns. Around 200 people were arrested during the subsequent clashes, with police using tear gas to disperse protestors. Climate activists in the US and Canada haven\u2019t been able to muster the kinds of numbers seen at marches in Europe and Australia (in particular), nor is there the celebrity impact of, say, Radiohead\u2019s Thom Yorke DJ-ing for the crowd, as happened in London earlier. But hundreds of people have shown their support for a shift to renewables across North America, including the White House, New York and the Texas capitol building in Austin. Ottawa and Vancouver will vie for the largest turnout of climate marchers in Canada. Several thousand people have gathered in Ottawa to hear environmentalist David Suzuki demand the \u201cnecessity\u201d of a fully renewable energy system. Prior to the march, Suzuki said he was glad to see the back of Stephen Harper, the pro fossil fuels former prime minister who was defeated earlier this month by Justin Trudeau and his Liberal party. \u201cWe\u2019ve had nine-and-a-half years of a Harper government that has basically not confronted the issue of climate change,\u201d Suzuki said. \u201cI believe that it is wilful blindness.\u201d Back in New York, a series of speakers have called for a greater effort to move towards 100% renewable energy. Among them is Bill Nye, aka the science guy. Organisers have announced that early estimates show the global climate marches are the largest ever held, with a likely total of more than 600,000 people. Around 570,000 people have already marched in 2,300 events in 175 countries around the world. Further marches in Vancouver, Ottawa and Mexico City are anticipated to push this number over 600,000, more than double the record set in last year\u2019s series of marches. All this was achieved despite the largest march, in Paris, called off due to security concerns. Instead, thousands of shoes were laid out to symbolise the missing protesters. According to organisers Avaaz, the largest marches took place in Melbourne (60,000 people) and London (50,000 people). Singer and activist Charlotte Church was one of those to attend the London march. She spoke to my colleague James Randerson about why she turned up - you can listen to their conversation here. Climate marches have started in Chicago, where participants were asked to paint the world on their faces, and Ottawa. Climate activists in Canada and the US were recently buoyed by Barack Obama\u2019s blocking of the controversial Keystone pipeline project. There will be no repeat of the enormous climate march that took place in New York in September last year. That gathering of more than 400,000 people featured plenty of stardust - UN secretary general Ban Ki Moon, former US vice president Al Gore, New York City mayor Bill de Blasio and actors Mark Ruffalo and Leonardo DiCaprio were among the hordes. Thanksgiving, which happened on Thursday, has somewhat clipped the wings of organisers in the US. There will, however, be events across the country. In New York, de Blasio will be the target, rather than participant, of a protest, with activists marching around City Hall at 2pm to demand greater investment in renewable energy and full divestment from fossil fuels. Obama\u2019s comments on the Paris talks, posted on Facebook two hours ago, unsurprisingly laments the recent attacks in the French city before delving into the purpose of his trip: I\u2019m heading to Paris today to join nearly 200 countries for a global conference on climate change. It\u2019s an opportunity to stand in solidarity with our oldest ally, just two weeks removed from the barbaric attacks there, and reaffirm our commitment to protect our people and our way of life from terrorist threats. It\u2019s also an opportunity for the world to stand as one and show that we will not be deterred from building a better future for our children. What makes this gathering different is that more than 180 nations have already submitted plans to reduce the harmful emissions that help cause climate change. And America\u2019s leadership is helping to drive this progress. In fact, our businesses and workers have shown that it\u2019s possible to make progress towards a low-carbon future while creating new jobs and growing the economy. Our economic output is at all-time highs, but our greenhouse gas emissions are down towards 20-year lows. So what we\u2019re trying to do in Paris is put in place a long-term framework for further emissions reductions - targets set by each nation, but transparent enough to be verified by other nations. And we\u2019ll work to mobilize support to help the most vulnerable countries expand clean energy and adapt to the effects of climate change we can no longer avoid. I\u2019m optimistic about what we can achieve - because I\u2019ve already seen America take incredible strides these past seven years. And with that - I\u2019ll see you in Paris. Hello from a crisp New York afternoon as events to mark the start of the Paris climate talks start to unfold in the US and Canada. US president Barack Obama won\u2019t be in the country to see any of them as he is enroute to Paris for the start of COP21. Obama will attend a series of meetings, opening with Xi Jinping, president of China. The White House hopes the meeting of the leaders of the two largest emitters of greenhouse gases will provide a helpful early shove to proceedings, helping avert the kinds of chaos seen at the Copenhagen talks in 2009. Obama will also meet French president Francois Hollande, where the threat of terrorism is likely to be a topic of conversation as well as global warming. Afterwards, the US president is expected to sit down with leaders of low-lying island nations that are considered particularly vulnerable to climate change. Leaders of countries such as Kiribati and the Marshall Islands hope the Paris talks not only provide a firm commitment to capping global temperature increases to just 1.5C but also to ensure the delivery of $100 billion in climate finance to help adaptation. Some island leaders aren\u2019t too hopeful over any of this. A record-breaking 50,000 people have marched in London. 20,000 people marched in Madrid and a similar number in Rome Climate marches in Australia and New Zealand were the biggest ever Pope Francis and Ban Ki-moon were among the people to donate 10,000 pairs of shoes to an installation in Paris to represent people who could not march because of orders imposed by authorities after the 13 November attacks Protests in Paris turned violent when hundreds of anti-capitalists clashed with police there Archbishop has warned world leaders of the consequences if they don\u2019t act at the Paris climate summit I\u2019m signing off for now but my colleague in New York, Oliver Milman, will shortly be taking over the live blog reins. Please keep sharing your photos of the marches via Guardian Witness. Here\u2019s a lighter video from London, of Charlotte Church singing: We\u2019ve just posted some video of the protests turning ugly in Paris: Environmental group 350.org has issued a statement distancing itself from the violent protests: Starting around 2:30pm, a small group of protesters unaffiliated with the climate movement arrived at Republique and began to clash with the police there, violating the nonviolent pledge that every group involved in the climate coalition here in France has agreed to. Police responded with tear gas and pepper spray. The protest dispersed by around 3:45pm. Events on the other side of the Atlantic are underway. Here are a series of photos from Rio de Janeiro, by author Jules Boykoff: I\u2019m still stuck in a corner of the square [Place de la Republique] with about 400 protesters. The space is cramped. About 50mx50m. People are being pulled occasionally from the crowd and dragged into police vans. People here are angry and frustrated that the police have swept everyone up. Some of them are core anarchists. Others are people just caught up in the police clearing of the square. \u201cIt seems like they are taking us randomly and just waiting for some of us to turn violent,\u201d said one protester who initially wanted to march for the climate. Police are still sporadically hitting the most confrontational activists with tear gas. The protesters had a sound system that was pumping out heavy dance music for a while. But police moved in and arrested a bunch of those dancing. \u201cWe are imprisoned, call the police!\u201d They are yelling. Charlotte Church brought a choir from Wales to perform a song written for the march. She suggested people on the march should name it. \u201cIt\u2019 s an absolute priviledge and honour to march with you today. What we have done here today is stage the biggest climate march in UK history,\u201d she said. Here are the lyrics to the song: Way before I was born we knew we had learned we should be concerned or we\u2019re doomed But chose to laugh in this face of an escapable fate...how brave To pass on the buck to the unborn, how brave Politics to one little fish means nothing but the opinion of all of us millions must count for something Despite facts irrefutable it\u2019s business as usual Here\u2019s a great gallery of events around the world today, put together by my colleague Eric Hilaire: Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who has previously called for people to divest from fossil fuel companies, has issued a statement calling on world leaders in Paris to act on climate change before it\u2019s too late. Here\u2019s an excerpt: It is an opportunity to address inequality; for powerful people and nations to acknowledge that their environmental wellbeing, their security and sustainability, is dependent on the wellbeing, security and sustainability of others. To acknowledge our inter-dependence, and the strengths and vulnerabilities we share. If we \u201ccarry on as usual\u201d, there may not be another opportunity. The days of not understanding the disastrous human and environmental consequences of rampant consumerism and greed are gone. Our leaders can no longer claim not to know. If they don\u2019t take action they will be saying very clearly that they don\u2019t care. Should they grasp the opportunity, and develop a legally binding treaty to mitigate climate change, it will signal the end of the age of reckless consumption, exploitation and greed. But failing to grasp the nettle will send a direct message of contempt to poorer nations and people, who cannot afford the costs of mitigating the impacts of increasing temperatures. It will trigger unprecedented economic and refugee crises, and dramatically deepen global insecurity. It\u2019s a simple equation, really. Agree on mechanisms to enforce adherence to environmental justice, or consciously embrace injustice and add fuel to the fire of human division and pain. We know that the only answer is to reduce carbon emissions, and the only way we can do that is by reducing our dependency on carbon fuels. I\u2019ve been talking with actor and Greenpeace supporter Emma Thompson. \u201cUnfortunately we live in a world which is absolutely in the pockets of fossil fuel companies,\u201d she said as we walked through London. Here are some brief clips of the interview: Organisers are saying more than 50,000 people have turned out for a march in the UK capital. That\u2019s far more than attended the London \u2018Wave\u2019 march in 2009, before the Copenhagen climate summit, and the 27,000 at last year\u2019s London climate march. Alex Wilks, campaign director at Avaaz, said: \u201cThis is the biggest climate march in British history with over 50,000 people marching today in London and thousands more in other cities across Britain. Our footsteps are echoing around the world alongside hundreds of thousands have taken to the streets calling for a transition to 100% clean energy.\u201d A Met Police spokeswoman told me they would not be commenting on numbers on the march. Campaign group Avaaz said 20,000 people had marched in Rome. Asad Rehman, a fixture at previous climate talks and Friends of the Earth\u2019s senior international climate campaigner, tells the London march: There is something deeply wrong with our world...the great injustice is that those who are least response for our crisis have to deal with its impacts. We live with a broken economic system that says that black lives don\u2019t matter, poor lives don\u2019t matter.... And it\u2019s people power that is going to defeat this climate crisis. We have the solutions but we just have politicians who lack the political will. Here are a group of S\u00e1mi, an indigenous people in Sweden who say their way of life is threatened by climate change, singing on the stage in London. Footage by James Randerson. Speaking in London, Friends of the Earth\u2019s new CEO, Craig Bennett, says: This is a fantastic display of people power with thousands upon thousands taking to the streets to demand urgent action on climate change. From Australia to Mozambique and the Philippines, as well as here in London, millions of our fellow citizens are urging our leaders to stand up to the global crisis of more floods, storms, droughts and rising seas. We know the challenge we face, we know the solutions: now is the time to act. Meanwhile in London, marchers have reached parliament, where a second round of speeches is taking place. Here is the (slightly blurry) view from the stage: I\u2019m now stuck in a corner of the plaza surrounded by hundreds of police and a few hundred protesters who have been systematically pushed back. No one can get in or out. The day of action in Paris has completely disintegrated into a stand off between groups of anarchist protesters and riot police. The large crowd who showed up to campaign for a positive outcome at COP21 left long ago. Police moved into la place de la Republique and kettling those left. About 500 anarchists, including many from the \u201cBlack Bloc\u201d, are pelting police with glass bottles. Police responding with flash-bang bombs and tear gas. An unauthorised demonstration at Place de la Republique degenerated into violence on Sunday afternoon. Hundreds of riot police sealed off the whole square and the roads around as clashes broke out with protestors. The protesters began by throwing missiles at police. There were several very large explosions, thought to be fireworks. Police began using tear gas to clear the area that has been a symbolic place of gathering since the Friday 13 November attacks in Paris. Police have now cleared the square. Still a helicopter overhead and sirens. Many of the flowers and candles left in tribute to the 130 people who died in the attacks have been trampled on and destroyed. The Guardian\u2019s Nabeelah Shabbir is near the front of the London march, near musician Charlotte Church. Here are some of her photos of a \u2018die-in\u2019 over the impacts of climate change on the developing world. Here\u2019s a short film from our video team of the marches, including the shoes in Paris. Organisers are saying that around 20,000 people marched in the Spanish capital. The future of the world may be decided inside a dozen or more vast, anonymous, rigid white structures on the edge of Paris. The convention centre at Le Bourget airport has been officially declared UN property for the duration of the meeting. It boasts a mini Eiffel tower constructed of red chairs, the main street is lined with 30 or more plastic animals and the 195 countries\u2019 offices are empty and little is expected to happen until tomorrow morning. Meanwhile Paris city centre is almost empty of traffic and all public transport has been made free for two days to discourage cars and allow nearly 150 world leaders to whizz around unhindered between bilateral meetings in five star hotels and embassies. And in the meantime, here some are some photos from James Randerson and Emma Howard on marchers who are staying sunny despite the diabolical weather: More soon from Paris, where Karl Mathiesen is among those caught up in the teargas used by police after people with an apparently anti-capatalist agenda clashed with police. From Geneva and Barcelona to Paris and Lyon, and Laikipia in Kenya, here are some of your march photos: Caroline Lucas, Green party MP, told crowds in London: To change everything we need everyone. That\u2019s why people are gathering in cities around this country and the world. We are already so far ahead of the governments and the private corporations who block us....We already know that what\u2019s on offer in Paris is nowhere near enough.we know that business as usual will take us towards a world of 4C warming....that is a future of droughts desertification and disease. We refuse to leave our future in the hands of those inside the secure zone in a conference centre in Paris... We already know what needs to be done. We need a massive investment in renewable energy and efficiency to create hundreds of thousands of jobs...we need to be serious about agriculture because meat production creates more emissions than all the card and trains and planes out together. Special shout out to divestment campaign who with all their inspiration have showed us the way David Cameron is taking a wreaking ball to environmental policy....We are here to say the fight against fracking and nuclear is only just beginning. Here\u2019s some video of Corbyn\u2019s speech, via James Randerson. Apologies for it being split into four parts: Corbyn, standing atop a fire engine in London next to shadow chancellor John McDonnell, tells his audience to send a message to the more than 147 world leaders expected to attend the Paris climate talks: Those who are sitting around the tables in Paris have an enormous opportunity in front of them. Do not let them flake it or fool us. Make them understand that if we are to bequeath to future generations a world of flooding, a world of environmental disaster, a world where our children will not be able to live or eat properly, then they will do nothing and allow the pollution of this planet to continue. If however, they listen to the words of millions all around the world: it is possible to reduce the level of emissions, it is possible to slow the rate of temperature change, it is possible to protect large parts fo the environment of this planet, then they will have done something useful. Our message today is to them: do what you are sent there to do. Videos to come shortly. Cecelia Anim, president of the Royal College of Nursing, tells me: Climate change is one of the greatest challenges we face. If it goes unchecked climate changewill be devastating for human health and will put a huge strain on our health system. Every healthcare professional has a duty to raise awareness of climate change. Health professionals must lead the way. In Paris a group of socialist activists who have been circling La Place de la Republique have confronted police at one of the exits of the famous roundabout. Tear gas and batons are being used to push them back. It appears to be a high jacking of the climate march by those with another agenda. \u201cIt is more to against capitalism [than a call for climate action],\u201d said one. Police just set off large bangs to deter the crowd. Which incensed them because of the resemblance to bombs. Fashion designer Vivienne Westwood is in London; she said: It looks great. We are the people. Politicians are criminals. They are trapped in the rotten financial system which is the cause of poverty war and climate change....Politicians just talk about how they are going to deal with it....How are they going to deal with what will be absolute horror? These idiots accept it. We need to stop it! There is no choice between the green economy and mass extinction. All parties were invited to speak in London but the Conservative party did not provide anyone. Lynne Featherstone is here from the Liberal Democrats. \u201cWe never find enough words to convey the cataclysm ahead. Unless we mitigate and adapt, the world will be in the greatest trouble we have ever seen,\u201d she said. Caroline Lucas is there for the Greens and Corbyn for Labour. The wind is blowing hard, the rain is coming down but still the people have come to London in their thousands. People have travelled here from Wales, Scotland and fracking communities in Lancashire who are standing right at the front. One group from Brighton travelled here on a bus powered by chip fat, according to organisers. There are people from the S\u00e1pmi indigenous community in Sweden, where the melting arctic is having a big impact on their daily lives. The Press Association is reporting that tens of thousands of people have gathered in central London for the march. I\u2019ll update you on numbers later, based on what organisers and police say. And here\u2019s Corbyn in London, where he\u2019s due to speak shortly (see 12:03). Next to him is Lisa Nandy MP, shadow energy and climate change secretary. Our reporter Karl Mathiesen is in Paris where the police are still out in numbers following the attacks just over a fortnight ago: The march in London is attracting some big crowds, colourful outfits and famous faces (I\u2019ve seen at least one Instagrammed selfie with musician Peter Gabriel. Actor Emma Thompson and singer/activist Charlotte Church are also out there somewhere). Emma Howard is on the ground for the Guardian and will be reporting live throughout the day. Even the BT tower is joining in: Here\u2019s an excerpt of what Corbyn is expected to say in around half an hour\u2019s time: The greener world I know is possible is a more just, a more equal, and a more productive world To tackle climate change, we must tackle global inequality, we must show that defeating the menace of global warming will not only improve the prospects of our children and grandchildren, but will improve lives here and now Britain should be at the forefront of that argument, leading global efforts to a political solution to climate change at the Paris conference. People have marched across Asia, the Middle East, and Africa, in Yemen, Tanzania, Singapore, South Africa and Benin among many other countries. Around 70 people reportedly turned up in Sanaa in Yemen, despite reported bombing by airplanes just a few miles away. Walid Yehia Hassan Al-Hashef, an Avaaz member in Sanaa has written in to say: Airstrike targets crowds of people and today early morning an airstrike hit around 4km from our protest location. We expected 150 people because of the airstrike only around 70 people showed up. Yes, I have a message to every human being on our planet... In Yemen we are peaceful people we do not have place in our behaviors or culture for terror. We in Yemen love all people christians, jews, muslims and others. Marches are getting underway in Berlin and Amsterdam: Latvian President Raimonds Vejonis, Europe\u2019s first Green party head of state, tells Reuters that because most countries have already submitted their climate plans, a deal in Paris in two weeks\u2019 time is close. \u201c...We are quite close to... an accord and a new Kyoto agreement, which would be a Paris agreement, hopefully will be reached,\u201d he said in reference to the 1997 Kyoto protocol, the only previous legally-binding international climate treaty. Vejonis also said he hoped all leaders would agree on a \u201clegally-binding document\u201d in Paris, apparently putting him at odds with the US, which has made clear it does not want a treaty. In case you were wondering (like me) what was going to happen to all the shoes in Place de la Republique, Avaaz tells me that they are being given to a social enterprise called Relais 75 Emmaus that works with homeless people. Tributes have been paid to Maurice Strong, the first executive director at the UN environment programme (Unep), who has died aged 86. He was also the secretary general at the Stockholm environment meeting in 1972 and Rio Earth Summit in 1992, which paved the way for the Paris climate summit that people are marching for today. The current Unep chief, Achim Steiner, said: \u201cStrong will forever be remembered for placing the environment on the international agenda and at the heart of development. He shepherd global environmental governance processes.\u201d Steiner added that a strong deal at Paris would be a \u201cfitting tribute\u201d to Strong\u2019s legacy. We\u2019ll have more on this later from my colleague John Vidal, who knew Strong. In his last interview with the Guardian, in 2010, Strong said of the state of the world\u2019s environment and the challenge of climate change: Analytically, I\u2019m pessimistic. I believe the odds are against us for making the changes we need to make in time. But, operationally, I\u2019m optimistic because I believe that it is still possible. Tougher the longer we delay it. The march that was expected to attract hundreds of thousands of people on the streets of Paris today may have been forbidden, but there are still plenty of people out calling for action on climate change in the French capital today. Tweets and live streams on Periscope show what appears to be hundreds of people forming a human chain in central Paris, holding placards calling for \u201cclimate justice\u201d and to \u201ckeep it [fossil fuels] in the ground\u201d. As well as the Pope, UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon has donated his shoes (a pair of new-looking running trainers), to the Paris shoe installation: Want to know what these marches are all about? If you can make it to London on Thursday, there\u2019s a Guardian Live event on the Paris climate summit with Australian Tim Flannery (former chief commissioner of the Climate Commission there), former UK climate diplomat John Ashton and Friends of the Earth CEO Craig Bennett. Find out more on the event listing. Our climate talks expert, Fiona Harvey, has also written a guide on everything you need to know about the Paris summit. Or you can watch our 60-second video explainer: March organisers say there were at least 140,000 people marching in Australia and 33,000 in New Zealand, both of which they say are the highest ever turn-outs for climate marches in both countries. The Guardian is unable to independently verify the numbers. Climate Home, part of the Guardian Environment Network, is in Paris this morning interviewing Emma Ruby-Sachs, acting executive director at Avaaz, which has been heavily involved in organising the marches. You can watch the interview here: Of the shoes installation in Paris, she says: It\u2019s kind of an incredible monument both to the voices that have been silenced but also to that hope for action that comes out of this city. Remember, you can share your photos and videos of the marches via Guardian Witness (just click the blue button above on this blog). Here are some already submitted, from Australia to Dublin: Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is among the public figures attending the London march later today, a spokeswoman has just confirmed to me. I\u2019ll update this post when I know exactly when and where along the march - there\u2019s a rally at 1pm at Millbank and speeches later at 2.45pm by parliament. Corbyn\u2019s attendance looks like a last-minute decision, given his name wasn\u2019t on lists of speakers even two days ago. According to my colleague Robin McKie, he will attack the Conservative party\u2019s leadership on climate change, following a series of green policies being cancelled over the summer, saying \u201cThere are no more hugs for the husky, instead it\u2019s a passionate embrace for the carbon polluters.\u201d It\u2019s the first time I can think of a leading Labour politician speaking at a big climate march - the most high profile politician is usually Green party MP, Caroline Lucas. Other speakers from 2.45pm include NUS vice-president, Piers Telemacque, and musician and activist Charlotte Church who is singing with a 12-piece choir. People are gathering in Cape Town\u2019s Keizergracht Street. The weather for the march there looks a lot better than London, where 40mph gusts are forecast this afternoon. Good morning from London, where march organisers are hoping to beat the turn-out of last year\u2019s climate march which attracted around 27,000 people. The march starts at noon (local time) at Park Lane. In Paris, as Claire pointed out, the planned march was forbidden over security fears. But thousands of shoes have been left in the Place de la Republique as an installation instead, among them a pair with Pope Francis\u2019s name on and the the inscription Laudato Si\u2019 (Praised be). Cardinal Turkson, seen as a potential future Pope, said: All members of the Catholic community are warmly invited to offer their support in prayer, word and action. And we\u2019re inviting all the bishops and priests around the world to offer the celebration of the Eucharist, on 29 November, for a responsible and successful international conference and summit. We want to encourage the faithful and many others to exercise their ecological citizenship. The BBC\u2019s David Shukman is at the scene in Paris: Among those who are bringing their shoes is Yeb Sano, the former Philippines climate negotiator who famously broke down in tears at several summits. He\u2019s just finished a weeks-long pilgrimage from Rome to Paris for the climate talks - hence the pilgrim shoes. There\u2019s also a group of indigenous people meeting in Paris for a \u2018healing ceremony\u2019 in solidarity with those who lost their lives in the recent terror attacks. I\u2019m now handing over the live blog to my colleague Adam Vaughan in London, who\u2019ll continue the coverage of marches across the globe today. Thanks for reading and for all your contributions here, on Twitter and via GuardianWitness. A reminder: you can share your pictures and videos from any of these marches \u2013 or any others taking place across the globe \u2013 via GuardianWitness or the blue button at the top of the live blog. Here are some from readers across the globe: Bangladesh Kenya New Zealand Which countries are doing the most to stop global warming? Check out how different nations compare in our interactive: Despite the rain, Lebanese protesters are currently marching the streets of the capital, Beirut: This year, marchers will not be able to rally in Paris, the home of the climate talks starting on Monday \u2013 demonstrations were cancelled in the wake of the 13 November terror attacks. Instead, others have been encouraged by Parisians to #March4Me; we\u2019ll be keeping an eye on that campaign throughout the day. Demonstrators who had planned to come to Paris have instead sent shoes in a sign of solidarity: Writing in the Guardian last week, Naomi Klein argued that the banning of the Paris march was silencing the very voices that need to be heard at the climate summit: For just two weeks every few years, the voices of the people who are getting hit first and worst get a little bit of space to be heard at the place where fateful decisions are made. That\u2019s why Pacific islanders and Inuit hunters and low-income people of colour from places like New Orleans travel for thousands of miles to attend. The expense is enormous, in both dollars and carbon, but being at the summit is a precious chance to speak about climate change in moral terms and to put a human face to this unfolding catastrophe. Even in these rare moments, frontline voices do not have enough of a platform in the official climate meetings, in which the microphone is dominated by governments and large, well-funded green groups. The voices of ordinary people are primarily heard in grassroots gatherings parallel to the summit, as well as in marches and protests, which in turn attract media coverage. Now the French government has decided to take away the loudest of these megaphones, claiming that securing marches would compromise its ability to secure the official summit zone where politicians will meet. Climate change rallies rolled on across Australia on Sunday, following well attended protests in Melbourne on Friday and Darwin and Brisbane on Saturday. On Sunday, it was the turn of Sydney, Canberra, Adelaide, Hobart and Perth. Australia\u2019s climate-sensitive neighbours in the Pacific were a key focus for the climate change rally in Sydney, with representatives of communities from Pacific nations \u2013 including Tuvalu, Nauru, Kiribati and Tonga \u2013 prominent at the front of the march from the Domain to Circular Quay. More than 40,000 people braved Sydney\u2019s heat for the rally on Sunday afternoon, calling on Australia to play a lead role in brokering binding emissions targets for the world to keep global temperature rise below 2C, and to commit to greater domestic emissions cuts than the 26% to 28% the government is currently proposing. In Canberra, people brought their children to march with them from Parliament House to the tent embassy, near Old Parliament House. Police estimate about 3,000 people showed up, while protesters think the number was closer to 6,000 The Perth event started sombrely. At 3.25pm, at least 5,000 people sat in silence in Hay Street Mall to mark people who have lost their lives, homes and livelihoods to the effects of climate change. The group, in their colour blocks, had marched 2km from Wellington Square and stretched the whole 300-metre length, watched by bemused Christmas shoppers clutching plastic bags and taking photos of the crowd. The march was led by a group from the Noongar Whadjuk nation and addressed by Christian, Islamic, Jewish, and Hindu faith leaders. You can read the full report here: The Seoul march is underway, with protesters making use of some inventive props: And of course it\u2019s not just Europe that is yet to march: here\u2019s a selection of other cities that will be on the move today. Please do get in touch below the line to share details of others you know or are going to. Again, all times are local. Durban, South Africa 10am at Suncoast Boulevard. Cape Town, South Africa 11am from Cape Peninsula University of Technology. Beirut, Lebanon Leaving Horsh Beirut at 9am, marchers will take the Damascus Road to reach Beirut Downtown at 12.30pm.

Japan Today reported that around 1,000 people marched in Tokyo on Saturday, but that organisers had hoped for many more: Some demonstrators were disappointed that the number of participants was not as many as expected, with Chigusa Okano, a 22-year-old university student in Tokyo, saying: \u201cI especially want young people to show interest in this matter.\u201d Alex Brodie, a 41-year-old company worker living in Tokyo, said he finds Japanese people\u2019s lack of interest in the issue \u201cpathetic\u201d. \u201cJapan needs to wake up. We need to have solar power on every roof top,\u201d he said as he marched with his wife and child, while calling on the Japanese government to push for policies to introduce more renewable energy. The issue of clean, renewable energy has been a key one since a tsunami swamped the Fukushima nuclear plant in 2011, sending three reactors into meltdown. \u201cJapan must take the lead in the summit to promote renewable energy because Japan is a rare country that has experienced such a big disaster,\u201d rally organiser Daigo Ichikawa told AFP news agency. AFP reports that more than 5,000 people took part in climate marches on Saturday across 30 different locations in Bangladesh \u2013 a country on the front line of climate change, exposed to rising seas, superstorms and expanding deserts. Unity is the theme of the People\u2019s Climate rally in Perth. Led by Noongar Whadjuk MCs, and kicked off with a Whadjuk dance to clear the bad spirits, the crowd then listened in silence to a multi-faith speech led by Perth Anglican assistant Bishop Tom Wilmot. Wilmot introduced Jewish, Hindu and Sikh leaders and made a point of referring to Rateb Jneid, president of the Islamic Council of Western Australia, as his \u201cbrother in the faith\u201d, repeating: \u201cAnd he is my brother.\u201d There has been no mention of the Paris attacks, but the group of more than 1000 people, which has now left Wellington Square to march on the city, will sit for a minute\u2019s silence in Hay Street Mall to mark those who have already lost their lives, homes and livelihoods from climate-related events. In particular the minute\u2019s silence will honour those affected by bushfires, which have killed six people in Australia this November. Kevin Jolley, president of the firefighters\u2019 union of WA, said that anyone who had spent time on a fire line knew that the effects of man-made climate change were devastating and real. \u201cThere are no sceptics on the end of a fire hose,\u201d Jolly said. Activists in the Philippines marched on Saturday, with Rappler reporting that thousands took to the streets across several cities, including the capital, Manila. Agence France-Presse reported: Some 3,000 people including religious clergy, students and activists marched through the Philippine capital of Manila demanding curbs on emissions to mute the impact of climate change, which is blamed for a spike in disastrous extreme weather. \u201cProtect our common home\u201d and \u201cclimate justice\u201d were written on the placards held aloft by the surging crowd. \u201cWe want to send a message to the rest of the world, especially the world leaders at the climate talks, to say that our survival is not negotiable,\u201d said Denise Fontanilla, spokeswoman for the Asian People\u2019s Movement on Debt and Development. The Perth marchers are getting ready to go. (Take a look at this post to get up to speed on the colour-coding.) They have been asked to \u201cstay classy\u201d as they march through the city streets, Calla Wahlquist reports. Indonesian president Joko Widodo left Jakarta for Paris this morning. His country has pledged to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 29% by 2030. But activists say Indonesia could be doing more to reduce its use of fossil fuels. In September, after months of raging forest fires, Indonesia overtook China and the US to become the world\u2019s biggest climate polluter.

Here are some of the pictures readers have shared so far. From Sydney, Australia: From New Zealand: From Edinburgh, Scotland: From Geneva, Switzerland: From San Luis Obispo, California, US: All roads in Sydney\u2019s CBD that were closed for the march have now reopened and there are no traffic delays reported. Safe journey home, Sydney marchers. Keep reading the blog, though. There\u2019s plenty more to come \u2026 Noongar Whadjuk man Noel Nannup gives the welcome, saying: \u201cOur planet is dying.\u201d Protesters say the fight for the climate can\u2019t be separated from the right of Indigenous people to country, Calla Wahlquist reports from the Perth rally. More than 300 people are gathered in coloured clumps under the trees that line Perth\u2019s Wellington Square, ahead of the people\u2019s climate rally. One of those is Gerard Siero, an ecological urbanism researcher at UWA (the University of Western Australia), who is wearing a yellow linen suit and leaning against his folding bike, which collapsed down to a 10kg stick for ease of commuting. He\u2019s marching for the solutions to climate change. \u201cWe have all the solutions we need to solve the problem,\u201d Siero said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the will on behalf of our politicians, but we have the will on behalf of the people. \u201cWhat we are really trying to march with today is to let the politicians know that they have to get out of the way.\u201d Siero said Australia had the capacity and technology to switch off carbon, but it was fast running out of time. \u201cWe\u2019re at the point where if we don\u2019t so something it will be too late to do anything but get out the ambulances,\u201d he said. Clover Moore, Sydney\u2019s lord mayor, says these numbers would make today the biggest climate march ever held in the city: My colleague Calla Wahlquist is in Perth, where marchers will be setting off in later today: We\u2019ll be following the progress of that march once it gets underway too, plus you can keep an eye on updates @callapilla. With the march in Paris \u2013 host of the COP21 climate summit \u2013 cancelled after the terrorist attacks of 13 November, activists have turned to other ways of showing their support for the global climate march, Reuters reports: Activists plan to join arms and form a \u201chuman chain\u201d in Paris on Sunday to urge action on global warming, in a muted rally after attacks on the city by Islamic State. More than 2,000 climate events are planned in cities including Sydney, Jakarta, Berlin, London, Sao Paulo and New York, making it one of the biggest days of action on climate change in history, organisers say. Activists in France scaled back their plans when the government imposed a state of emergency after the attacks two weeks ago killed 130 people, banning the planned demonstration in Paris, meant as the biggest of all. In France, activists plan to form a static human chain, formed by about 3,400 people joining arms along what had been the original 3km (1.9 miles) route through central Paris from the Place de la Republique to Place de la Nation. \u201cThis is a moment for the whole world to join hands,\u201d said Iain Keith, campaign director for Avaaz, one of the organisers. Separately, more than 10,000 demonstrators who had planned to come to Paris have instead sent shoes to form a big pile in a sign of solidarity. Organisers said the Vatican even sent a pair to represent Pope Francis. Alix Mazounie of French Climate Action Network said the activists reckoned a human chain would not violate the state of emergency. \u201cThis is not civil disobedience,\u201d she said. The chain would break, for instance, wherever it crossed a road to avoid disrupting traffic. But, underscoring security worries, France put 24 green activists under house arrest before the summit, interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve said on Saturday, saying they were suspected of planning violent protests at the talks. Foreign minister Laurent Fabius welcomed the worldwide demonstrations. \u201cIt is very positive,\u201d Fabius said, for governments to feel public pressure to act. While Australian PM Malcolm Turnbull heads to Paris for the climate summit, Puppet Malcolm decided to take a turn in the Sydney march: And it seems he brought an old, um, pal with him: The Sydney march is well and truly on the move, reports Ben Doherty: Playing \u2018Hot, Hot, Hot\u2019 as they march down Macquarie St towards the Opera House. Jubilant, boisterous mood. The Canberra march has wrapped up without incident, and ACT Policing has issued Guardian Australia with this statement from operation commander Jo Cameron: There was a large, well-behaved crowd and it was a peaceful event. There were no arrests and no incidents. There were some road closures during the march, which were opened as soon as possible. As you were, Canberra. Carry on with your weekend. My colleague Janine Israel has also been at the Sydney rally, and reports that many Islander and Indigenous communities are represented at the march. She spoke to members of Australia\u2019s Tongan community. One protester told her: Our islands are drowning. Where are we going to go? Australia\u2019s prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, will arrive in Paris later tonight for key international climate talks, armed with a climate target that\u2019s lower than many other developed countries. The Australian government has committed to cutting emissions by 26%-28% of 2005 levels by 2030. By comparison, the United States has vowed to cut emissions by 26%-28% too \u2013 but five years earlier than Australia, by 2025. Canada has committed to a 30% cut and so has New Zealand, while the European Union has vowed to reduce emissions by 40% of 1990 levels by 2030. The Labor party released its own targets on Friday. It wants a 45% cut by 2030, a figure Turnbull has criticised as \u201cheroic\u201d and expensive. But modelling by leading economist Warwick McKibbon, did not find a large difference in the economic impacts of the targets. A reduction of 26% would shave between 0.2% and 0.3% of the GDP, while a 45% reduction would see between 0.5% and 0.7% lost. Helpful reminder for those marching in Sydney right now: The crowds in Sydney have observed one minute\u2019s silence to reflect upon those most affected by climate change, ended by the sounding of a didgeridoo. Many of those there are saying that the Domain \u2013 no small space \u2013 is almost full to capacity. Once the speeches and songs are finished, the rally is set to march through the streets of Sydney in colour-coordinated blocks: yellow for \u201csolutions\u201d, eg renewables. orange for \u201cjust transitions\u201d, advocating for fair jobs. red to stand with those already on the front line of climate change. purple for diversity of faith and cultures. blue to represent future generations. white for those in healthcare and science. blue to stand up for threatened ecosystems. and a group marching for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Although it is very hot in Sydney today, with protesters \u2013 those who weren\u2019t canny enough to bring their umbrellas \u2013 seeking out whatever shade they can find, activists are well aware that the real front line against climate change lies further west, in the Pacific islands. A good primer on that situation is this report by my colleague Oliver Milman: The cause for concern is clear \u2013 Nasa recently reported the world\u2019s sea level has risen nearly 8cm since 1992, with the Pacific experiencing a more rapid increase than other oceans. A rise of around a metre by the end of the century now looks likely. For low-lying islands in the Pacific, this means coastal erosion, saltwater seeping into precious rainwater catchments and ruined crops. Meanwhile, rising temperatures will heighten the risk of diseases, including those carried by mosquitos. Cyclones are expected to become more severe. The World Health Organisation estimates climate change will cause around 250,000 deaths globally between 2030 and 2050. My colleague Ben Doherty is in Sydney\u2019s Domain, sheltering from the sun and hearing from Professor Tim Flannery, one of Australia\u2019s leading climate change activists, who says today \u201clooks like the largest climate march ever in Australia\u201d. The Paris talks, he said, are the last chance to save \u201cmany things we care about, like the Great Barrier Reef \u2026 We are coming to this issue very late.\u201d There are no easy fixes to the climate problem, he warned, but Australia needs to close down polluting industries and dependence on fossil fuels: We are meeting in the home city of the Australian prime minister. We need to send a very powerful message to him: do what the people demand. He said the Australian people would not accept anything less than a successful outcome at Paris. It was a very peaceful, family-oriented affair in Canberra, as people brought their children to march with them from Parliament House to the tent embassy, near Old Parliament House. Police estimate around 3,000 people showed up, while protesters think the number is closer to 6,000. Canberrans are fairly cautious about protesting, as many are public servants and are often reluctant to make political statements. One of the coordinators of the event, Emma Robinson from the Conservation Council, said she was not surprised that so many showed up in the capital. \u201cClimate change is and has always been everyone\u2019s business,\u201d she said. The event was staffed by about 80 volunteers, most of whom are Canberra locals who are part of the Conservation Council. Former chief scientist of Australia, Penny Sackett, said that protests like Sunday\u2019s make people feel as though they are taking action on climate change. \u201cPeople can become discouraged because it appears as though [political] change does not happen swiftly enough,\u201d she told Guardian Australia. She said the march was a message from voters to world leaders who are about to meet on climate change in Paris: \u201cWe\u2019re watching.\u201d The Canberra Times now estimates there are more than 5,000 people taking part in the march there. Attendance numbers are always a tricky thing with marches, with totals from organisers and police often varying wildly. Police estimates for Melbourne, for example, put the crowd numbers by the end of Friday night at about 40,000, but organisers said 60,000 turned out. Similarly, estimates for Brisbane on Saturday came in at between 5,000 and 10,000. We\u2019re yet to hear estimates for the Sydney crowd but organisers already seem overwhelmed by the numbers who have shown up so far. An enterprising cyclist at the Adelaide rally: Meanwhile, some Sydney marchers seek out the shade: The Sydney rally is underway, with thousands already in attendance and many more still arriving: Ben Doherty is now in the Domain, from where the march is leaving, and reports \u201cmassive numbers\u201d: Much more multi-coloured than the Hyde Park beginnings, people in all manner of colours, lots of associated causes: anti-nuclear, church groups, refugee groups. One guy has a mallard on his head, and a tree growing out of his backpack. Sydney lord mayor Clover Moore tells the crowd that COP21 in Paris will be the most important meeting of our lifetime. \u201cOn it depends the future of our planet,\u201d she says. Hello Hobart! Tasmanian marchers are also assembling, with a minute\u2019s silence for Paris, which is hosting this week\u2019s climate talks, but \u2013 after the terrorist attacks of 13 November \u2013 will not be holding its own climate march: My colleague Ben Doherty is with the Sydney marchers and sends this dispatch from the start line: At the Sydney march, there are red shirts everywhere. Solid, if not yet spectacular numbers are gathering at the north end of Hyde Park, and marching into the Domain in bright sunshine. Labor deputy leader Tanya Plibersek, who brought her own phalanx of rosily-attired Young Laborites, gave a rangy press conference at which she rejected the \u2018heroic\u2019 label Malcolm Turnbull affixed to Labor\u2019s emissions targets (it wasn\u2019t meant as a compliment, Plibersek seems to suspect). She condemned Turnbull for \u201cstopping off on the way to Paris to lecture other heads of government to do more on climate change, while he is doing less\u201d. Plibersek said Labor\u2019s targets would require significant change in Australia, but that the country had already seen, and embraced, change aimed at reducing emissions. She said the $1m Australia has offered to contribute to the Commonwealth\u2019s new Climate Finance Access Hub (established at the CHOGM meeting in Valetta) was \u201cpathetically puny\u201d. The hub will be set up to help small island nations vulnerable to climate change access global funds for mitigation and adaptation. Plibersek said Australia, given its role as a leader in the Pacific region, needed to do more to help its neighbours, some of whom face \u201can existential threat\u201d from climate change. Sydney marchers are also warming up \u2013 as is the weather, with that blue sky deciding to put in an appearance after all \u2013 and is expected to be the biggest Australian march of the day. Will NSW be able to best Melbourne\u2019s 40,000+ from Friday? Reader Tim Senior and friends are well stocked with placards for the Sydney rally: A reminder: do keep your pictures, videos, thoughts and headcounts coming, to me directly @Claire_Phipps or via the blue GuardianWitness button at the top of the blog. Thank you! My colleague Shalailah Medhora is at the Canberra march, which has just started. She estimates there are around 3,000 people there so far: I\u2019ll be tracking the progress of the Canberra march \u2013 along with the others today \u2013 on this live blog, plus you can keep an eye on it via @shalailah. Many thousands of people marched in New Zealand on Saturday, with more events today: check here for those listings. An estimated 7,000 turned out in Wellington: And there were around 15,000 marchers in Auckland, with 8,000 more in Christchurch: We know already what the biggest emitters have committed to: The EU will cut its emissions by 40%, compared with 1990 levels, by 2030. The US will cut its emissions by 26% to 28%, compared with 2005 levels, by 2025. China will agree that its emissions will peak by 2030. Nations responsible for more than 90% of global emissions have now come up with their targets \u2013 known in the UN jargon as intended nationally determined contributions, or INDCs. These include all of the major developed and developing countries, though their contributions vary: in the case of developed countries, actual cuts in emissions, but for developing countries a range of targets including limits on emissions compared to \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d, and pledges to increase low-carbon energy or preserve forests. Analysis of the INDCS, endorsed by the UN, has suggested that these pledges are enough to hold the world to about 2.7C or 3C of warming. That is not quite enough to meet the scientific advice. However, that is not the end of the story. One of the key components of any Paris agreement would be to institute a system of review of the emissions targets every five years, with a view to ratcheting them upwards. Another, and complementary, approach is to make more effort to bring down emissions outside the UN process, for instance by engaging \u201cnon-state actors\u201d such as cities, local governments and businesses to do more. It\u2019s Canberra\u2019s turn now, and again it looks to be a very healthy turnout under a beautiful blue sky (it\u2019s rather grey here in Sydney, not that that should put anyone off): The Adelaide rally is underway and it\u2019s a good turnout, estimated in the thousands: A reminder: you can contribute your own pictures and videos via the blue GuardianWitness button at the top of this live blog, and/or to me @Claire_Phipps. Avaaz, the campaign group behind the march, says more than 120,000 people have already taken part \u2013 with thousands of rallies yet to take place on Sunday, the main day of action. Thousands of people marched in Brisbane on Saturday \u2013 organisers put it at 10,000 \u2013 and more in Darwin, following Friday\u2019s 40,000-strong rally in Melbourne. Organisers said thousands took part in 35 New Zealand locations \u2013 the smallest being on Raoul Island, where the island\u2019s entire population of seven turned out. My colleague Melissa Davey was at the Melbourne march on Friday evening and sent this report: Thousands of people were marching through Melbourne\u2019s CBD on Friday evening in what is expected to the largest in a series of climate change protests being held throughout Australia over the weekend. They gathered in front of the state library and, as the lawns filled with protesters putting finishing touches on their placards, they took to the surrounding roads just in time for peak hour. Environmentalists, unionists, religious organisations, youth groups, doctors, Indigenous organisations, and people from the aid and development sector were part of the crowd. Police estimates put the crowd numbers by the end of the night at about 40,000, but organisers said 60,000 turned out for the event. After the terrorist attacks of 13 November, the meeting of world leaders in the French capital beginning on Monday has an added poignancy. But the COP 21 talks \u2013 it stands for conference of the parties, the yearly United Nations climate change conference; this is the 21st \u2013 will focus on hammering out a new global agreement to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions and with them the threat of climate change. Here are a couple of key questions answered by the Guardian\u2019s environment reporter Fiona Harvey: Why now? Current commitments on greenhouse gas emissions run out in 2020, so at Paris governments are expected to produce an agreement on what happens for the decade after that at least, and potentially beyond. Why is this important? Scientists have warned that if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, we will pass the threshold beyond which global warming becomes catastrophic and irreversible. That threshold is estimated as a temperature rise of 2C above pre-industrial levels, and on current emissions trajectories we are heading for a rise of about 5C. That may not sound like much, but the temperature difference between today\u2019s world and the last ice age was about 5C, so seemingly small changes in temperature can mean big differences for the Earth. Will world leaders go to Paris? Yes. The heads of state or government of more than 130 countries have already said they will come. These include French president Francois Hollande, Barack Obama of the US, Xi Jinping of China, Narendra Modi of India, Angela Merkel of Germany, Australia\u2019s Malcolm Turnbull, John Key of New Zealand and David Cameron of the UK. Unlike the Copenhagen talks in 2009, however, at which world leaders turned up at the last minute of the two weeks of talks, this time the leaders will arrive at the beginning of the conference, give their negotiating teams clear instructions, and expect a fully formed agreement at the end of it. Some Australian cities have already met and marched, with Melbourne getting in first on Friday evening, and Darwin and Brisbane on Saturday. I\u2019ll have reports and pictures from those marches on this live blog shortly, along with news from New Zealand, which held most of its events on Saturday too. Here\u2019s the line-up for today: Adelaide: Action started from 11am local (11.30am AEDT) at Ester Lipman Gardens, adjacent to the Torrens Parade Ground. Canberra: Speakers from 12 midday at Parliament Lawns before the march to the Tent Embassy grounds and West Lawns. Sydney: Marchers are asked to gather at 12.30 for a 1pm start from the Domain. Hobart: March begins at 1pm from Parliament Lawns. Perth: Another 1pm start (4pm AEDT), from Wellington Square. Plus a heap of other marches \u2013 if one can heap a march \u2013 in other towns and cities: check out the list on the People\u2019s Climate March website. Welcome to live coverage of the global climate march \u2013 a continent-spanning series of rallies which organisers hope will see millions of people join to highlight the need for a worldwide consensus on tackling climate change ahead of the COP21 talks in Paris, which open tomorrow. I\u2019ll be kicking off this live blog from Sydney, handing over later to colleagues in London and New York, and aiming to bring you updates from marches in all those places and everywhere in between. Last year, tens of thousands of people demonstrated in London, Paris, Berlin and Brussels; thousands more turned out in Sydney and Brisbane, with 30,000 thronging the streets of Melbourne. In New York, more than 300,000 marchers took part, on a day of 2,700 simultaneous climate events worldwide. This year, marchers will not be able to rally in Paris, the home of the climate talks starting on Monday \u2013 demonstrations were cancelled in the wake of the 13 November terror attacks. Instead, others have been encouraged by Parisians to #March4Me; we\u2019ll be keeping an eye on that campaign throughout the day. If you\u2019re taking part in the marches and want to share a story, an observation, a pun or a picture, please do get in touch below the line or give me a shout on Twitter @Claire_Phipps. I\u2019ll tweet key developments from there too. You can also share your pictures and videos of the march via GuardianWitness here or the blue button at the top of the blog, just up there.",

          "bodyText": "Canada\u2019s new Liberal government has announced that it will not meet its target of bringing 25,000 Syrian refugees into the country by the end of this year \u2013 but pledged to resettle the full number by February with a focus on accepting families, women at risk, and members of the LGBTQ community. \u201cThis is a happy day and this is an important day for Canada,\u201d said the immigration minister, John McCallum, who released details of the plan on Tuesday, saying the country will \u201cwelcome them with a smile\u201d. After a landslide electoral victory in October, the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, was left scrambling to meet a campaign pledge to resettle 25,000 refugees by 31 December. McCallum conceded that only 10,000 refugees will arrive by that date, but said a further 15,000 will reach the country by the end of February, adding that the government was taking the extra time to \u201cdo it right\u201d. \u201cA smile alone is not sufficient. We want them to have a roof over their head. We want them to have support,\u201d he said. Canada\u2019s announcement stands in contrast to the alarming political rhetoric from politicians in the US, where at least 30 state governors have said they will refuse to accept Syrian refugees, and Republican frontrunner Donald Trump has described those fleeing civil war violence as a potential \u201cTrojan horse\u201d for Islamist militants. But the Liberal plan has also drawn some criticism after it emerged that single men will \u2013 at least initially \u2013 only be accepted if they were traveling with their family or could prove that they had been targeted due to their sexual orientation. The executive director of the Canadian Council of Refugees, Janet Dench, said Tuesday\u2019s announcement was \u201clong overdue\u201d. But she said she had misgivings about the exclusion of unaccompanied men, which she suggested reinforced stereotypes about Syrian men as \u201cinherently dangerous\u201d. Refugees will be vetted by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and by a handful of Canadian agencies \u2013 a process the federal public safety minister, Ralph Goodale, called a \u201crobust, multi-layered\u201d verification. The refugees will be identified and processed overseas by the UNHCR and Canadian officials in Jordan and Lebanon. Those two countries will also assist in the resettlement, including by securing exit visas. Privately chartered planes \u2013 with military transport assisting if necessary \u2013 will bring them to Canada. On arrival, they will be resettled in communities across the country. Temporary housing on military bases is available for short-term housing if needed. It is estimated the plan will cost C$678m over six years. Despite initial misgivings about the fast-tracked intake from politicians in Saskatchewan and Quebec, provincial premiers have supported the government plan. \u201cThis is not a federal project, this is not even a government project, it\u2019s a national project for all Canadians,\u201d said McCallum. Trudeau\u2019s predecessor Stephen Harper had refused to accept more Syrian refugees, even after the issue became a key electoral issue when it emerged that Alan Kurdi \u2013 the Syrian boy whose body washed ashore in Turkey attracted worldwide attention \u2013 had family in Canada. During the campaign Harper\u2019s Conservative party was accused of attempting to use Muslim immigration as a wedge issue, but opinion polls have shown that Canadian attitudes towards refugees are still somewhat more welcoming than those in the US and UK. James Hollifield, an expert on refugees and immigration with the Washington-based Wilson Center, said that Canada tends to be a \u201cbig outlier\u201d compared with other western nations in its openness to accepting immigrants and refugees. Hollifield said that contrast was due to a broadly successful immigration policy, a clear demand for immigrants in the workforce, and a geography that buffers it from the effects of illegal immigration. But he warned that adding national security concerns to the ramped-up rhetoric of a US presidential election cycle had created a \u201cperfect storm\u201d to politicize the refugee debate. \u201cAnything that brings chaos, uncertainty, division in the west and pits a large Muslim community against western societies in which they have settled, that\u2019s exactly what [Islamists] want,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately, a lot of politicians have taken the bait hook, line and sinker.\u201d Trudeau has called on Canadians to reject racism, but the country has seen a spike in anti-Muslim hate incidents in recent weeks. An Ontario mosque was firebombed. A Muslim woman in Toronto was attacked, punched in the stomach and verbally assaulted by two men. An Ottawa woman received a note in her mailbox with the message: \u201cCanada is no place for immigrants and terrorists. Go back home.\u201d Amira Elghawaby, with the National Council of Canadian Muslims, said that Canada has an \u201cundercurrent\u201d of Islamophobia which surfaces in the wake of events like those in Paris. \u201cA small minority of people will act on their ignorance,\u201d she said. But she said that many Canadians are ready to open their arms to the waves of refugees about to start arriving in the country next week. \u201cWhat I\u2019m seeing right now across Canada is an incredible groundswell of love and compassion and support for the refugees,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really quite incredible.\u201d",

          "bodyText": "British and American public opinion towards refugees has hardened following the terrorist attacks in Paris. More than four in ten (44%) Britons now believe that the UK should close its borders to refugees entirely, up five points since October, according to new research by Ipsos Mori. The view is shared by nearly one in two (48%) Americans, up two points compared with last month. Opinions in the two countries are in stark contrast to opinion in Canada, where a third of voters want to see borders shut to refugees, which represents a one point drop on October. The debate in the US after the attacks in Paris has centred around the security checks and processes that Syrian refugees go through before being resettled, with the rhetoric among Republican presidential candidates turning particularly explosive and the House of Representatives passing a bill that would make it even more difficult for refugees from Syria and Iraq to enter the country. Meanwhile, the Canadian government of recently elected prime minister Justin Trudeau has reaffirmed its commitment of increasing to the 25,000 the number of Syrian refugees it aims to welcome by the end of the year. In all three countries surveyed there is strong agreement for putting refugees through proper security screening regardless of their situation, with 83% of Americans, 80% of Canadians and 86% of Britons saying that this should be the case. Far fewer \u2013 28% in the US, 25% in the UK and 30% in Canada \u2013 believe refugees should be admitted as quickly as possible when a humanitarian emergency takes place, a 10-point drop across all three countries on views held before last weekend\u2019s events. Canadians also have a different perspective to Britons and Americans when it comes to perceiving refugees as a threat; 67% believe there are terrorists posing as refugees. This compares to eight in 10 in both the UK and the US who believe that terrorists are pretending to be refugees, up nine and four points respectively compared with the month before events in Paris. But all three countries have seen a double digit increase in how dangerous they view the threat of terrorism, with 95% of Britons, 91% of Americans and 75% of Canadians now saying that the threat of an attack in their own country in the next 12 months is real and 84%, 89% and 66% respectively fearing an international war. However, nearly two thirds of respondents in all three countries have confidence in their respective government\u2019s ability to provide the appropriate levels of security and protection in the event of a terrorist attack. A smaller proportion \u2013 but still a majority in Britain, the US and Canada \u2013 believes there is a real threat of an inter-minority conflict or an WMD attack within the next 12 months. In the case of a nuclear, biological or chemical attack, the proportion of those that feels protected by their government falls to around 50% in all three countries. Another area of debate has been the alleged failures of Europe\u2019s intelligence services and their ability to keep the European Union\u2019s open Schengen area borders secure. This may explain, in part at least, why confidence in security forces to identify potential terrorists has dropped in all three countries surveyed. One in two Canadians (48%), a third of Britons (34%) and four in 10 Americans (39%) are confident in their country\u2019s respective security forces ability to identify potential terrorists who pretend to be refugees. One aspect that is clear from the UK data is that the events of the past week have increased a belief among the British public that the government needs to do \u201csomething\u201d: A majority of Britons (54%) now says that doing nothing in Syria would be worse than taking military action, a 14 point increase since September 2013 when parliament rejected UK military action against Syria. One in two back the use of military intervention in areas of conflict, up 16 points since October. More than eight in 10 want to see an increase in border controls and checks, up 11 points over the past month. Two thirds want to see an increase in aid to refugees in UN camps on the border of Syria, up four points. Just over four in 10 believe Britain should help other European countries who are taking refugees, such as Germany, Italy and Greece, up seven points compared to the weeks prior to the Paris attacks. However, less than a quarter of Britons want the UK to increase the number of refugees accepted into Britain by more than the existing commitment (20,000 people), which represents a four point drop over the same period. In contrast, the proportion of the public that believes the problems of Syria are none of Britain\u2019s business and the UK should not interfere has dropped by 28 points to 30% since the 2013 House of Commons vote. There are important nuances in the data though. Eight Britons in 10 believe that taking military action in Syria will encourage attacks on the UK and the west, while other attitudes towards the refugee crisis remain at largely similar levels to before the Paris attacks. Just over a half of British respondents in the Ipsos survey have sympathy for refugees coming to Europe (up three points on October), a third believes that refugees should not count towards the government\u2019s immigration targets and 28% say that Britain has responded well to the refugee crisis (also up three points on last month). The proportion that believes immigration has generally had a positive impact on Britain is also relatively unchanged by events in Paris. It is up three points since last month, on 34%, and higher, for example, than in November 2010, when fewer than a fifth of Britons shared this view. However, it is unclear how the public\u2019s understanding of immigration weighs on many of its views. The Ipsos data reveals that Britons believe 23% of migrants are coming to UK to seek asylum while the actual proportion is less than 5%. The Paris attacks appear to have had little effect on British views on EU membership. Some 30% believe the EU\u2019s poor response to the refugee crisis shows that Britain needs to leave the EU, up only two points over the past four weeks. Among the respondents of the three countries surveyed, British citizens are the most pessimistic around prospects for the future integration of refugees. Only 43% are confident that refugees will integrate into British society compared to 52% in the US and 57% in Canada. Methodology: Ipsos Mori interviewed 1,002 adults aged 16-75 in Canada, 1,007 in Great Britain, 1,002 in the USA. Interviews were carried out online 18-19 November 2015 and weighted to national profiles. The results are compared with previous surveys also carried out online by Ipsos.",

          "body": "<h2><strong>Jakarta, 12 November</strong></h2> <p>Departure from the Royal Australian Air Force base in Canberra. The media flies before the prime minister who catches up later in a faster plane. The uniformed chaps with the high-gloss shoes greet everyone, this time at 3am, with a cheery good morning. Because it happens to be 3am this greeting is accompanied with laughter. The \u201cat you\u201d kind, not the \u201cwith you\u201d kind.</p> <p>It\u2019s a typical departure in that everyone has a stress point. You can feel the centres of stress pulsing around the terminal. One colleague\u2019s dog has vomited profusely in the kitchen. Another frets this is the best we are going to feel for at least a week.</p> <p>In the blink of an eye we are wheels up, then a brief panic ensues when it appears two passports have been left behind. No drama, the passports are located.</p> <p>TV crews huddle in the aisles and talk logistics. Fitful sleep is had. In what feels a short space of time we are thudding on the tarmac in the Indonesian capital. The heat hits like a fan-forced oven.</p> <p>Our liaison person from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, hovering with intent at the bottom of the stairs, is from the take-no-prisoners school, cheerful and practical, all precision, like the RAAF. We are blasting through Jakarta traffic with a police escort with a program in our hands which is locked down to the footnotes.</p> <p>Pretty shortly it\u2019s obvious why. Everything in Jakarta contains an element of mystery. The government and its apparatus does what it does. There is always the potential for things to slide off the rails. A fixed program must be reassuring in a post where mild incomprehension or outright frustration is occupational risk.</p> <p>Having spent weeks nailing the program, DFAT (of course) thinks we are doing the program. Malcolm Turnbull (of course) has a different idea. When he lands, he\u2019d like to do a short press conference. One senses the distinct sound of silent screams from the advancers. One can only sense the scream because the poker face is absolute.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f8ebcf823855c0f1ad6535a3cfdad22f23f83699\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f8ebcf823855c0f1ad6535a3cfdad22f23f83699/527_173_4401_2994/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Malcolm Turnbull and wife Lucy (right) arrive at the Fairbairn RAAF Base in Canberra, before nine days of travel through Asia and Europe.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"680\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Malcolm Turnbull and wife Lucy (right) arrive at the Fairbairn RAAF Base in Canberra, before nine days of travel through Asia and Europe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dean Lewins/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s an odd call by the prime minister. By speaking to the media before the events today, and with the time difference, at least for print editions and the TV news, he\u2019s just made our one day in Jakarta actually about the rats-and-mice domestic political issues back at home. I wonder if he gets that? New boy. Rookie error. Given we are in Jakarta so the Australian government can reset one of our most important foreign policy relationships, you\u2019d think we\u2019d keep our collective line of sight on that.</p> <p>We roar on to the presidential palace, which is a marvellous building in the grand colonial style. No-one in our media entourage is entirely sure what is happening because guidance is vague. The Indonesian media have been well briefed and swim like a school of fish in elegant formation. We visitors try to plug into the slipstream but lack a certain confidence. Confusion is inevitable.</p> <p>There will be no remarks by Turnbull and his Indonesian host, someone tells us, which is awkward, given that\u2019s actually what we came for. On the strength of that advice, most of the Australian press pack departs the scene. Later we learn there have indeed been remarks, which have to be chased.</p> <p>David Bold, Turnbull\u2019s senior media adviser, is a young man but an old soul. He\u2019s from the human shock absorber school of press secretary, which in the combative world of Canberra in recent years, is a bit of a throwback. One suspects Bold could emerge from a nuclear blast, straighten his tie, and suggest we all go to the bar for a martini, but even he\u2019s looking mildly disconcerted by Jakarta\u2019s lack of fixed points, nothing is shared, but a little wrinkle forms between the eyes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"93feccae763822b819b5cc24fa5f75f704d33516\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/93feccae763822b819b5cc24fa5f75f704d33516/0_242_3827_2298/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Malcolm Turnbull with the Indonesian President Joko Widodo at the Tanah Abang retail market in Jakarta. \u2018Been for a bit of shopping?\u2019 he asked our reporter.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Malcolm Turnbull with the Indonesian President Joko Widodo at the Tanah Abang retail market in Jakarta. \u2018Been for a bit of shopping?\u2019 he asked our reporter.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adek Berry/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After the formalities at the palace, Joko Widodo and Turnbull go to a local textile market for a walk through \u2013 a \u201cdown with the people\u201d opportunity the Indonesian president has never offered another world leader. <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/david-cameron/11767386/David-Cameron-poses-for-selfie-with-Indonesian-singer.html\">David Cameron walked here, but on his own.</a></p> <p>Much is made of this generosity. \u201cWonderful. Totemic.\u201d</p> <p>Less is made of the fact the walk was actually the idea of the Australian ambassador, Paul Grigson, and the Indonesians have agreed, doubtless for their own domestic motivations. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/nov/12/market-forces-help-turnbull-to-build-warmer-relations-with-indonesia\">Market forces help Turnbull to build warmer relations with Indonesia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Arriving at the market is a shock. Turnbull\u2019s police detail take one look at the market and their profound objection to this outing is written all over their stony faces. You feel their attentiveness level climb by several notches.</p> <p>I wait for the politicians at the bottom of a flight of steps. The crowd is swelling all around me, like a rising tide. It keeps coming, filling, spilling outwards, lapping the corners. The smart phones are out, children are being thrust forward. </p> <p>There are too many people in this space. Too many blind corners. In theory, in the program, this event is a choreographed media opportunity, benign as hell. In reality we are right on the edge of the unknowable.</p> <p>Turnbull senses the deep crazy as soon as he arrives. It\u2019s baking hot. The leaders\u2019 jackets come off. The Indonesian foreign minister grabs some paper towels for Turnbull, who is erupting like a drinking fountain. Jokowi of course is dry as a desert, and serene, executing one of his rituals.</p> <p>The Indonesian security presence suddenly materialises and asserts itself, (where did they come from, so many of them) pushing people back, aggressively, particularly Australian cameras. I\u2019m pushed back courtesy of someone being pushed into me and lose control of my own motion. It\u2019s like being dumped in the surf.</p> <p>The prime minister catches sight of me being tossed about. I can see his range of emotions immediately. Right now he is hovering on the edge of this sortie being complete insanity and the absolute best thing he\u2019s ever experienced. Both feelings are there, behind his smiling sweaty face.</p> <p>\u201cBeen for a bit of shopping Murpharoo?\u201d Turnbull says, drolly.</p> <p>A TV man swings in an arc to get out of the way of the people tide and clocks a security man with his camera. There\u2019s a sharp collective intake of breath, we all freeze for a moment, but instead of getting handcuffs, the Indonesian extends his hand in forgiveness.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Turnbull is ebullient. Disaster or best thing ever? Well, it\u2019s the latter of course</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We make it out, and settle ourselves with a quick drink in the holding hotel. Turnbull is ebullient. Disaster or best thing ever? Well, it\u2019s the latter of course. And it was an incredible experience. </p> <p>He tells us he was so moved when a little boy in the crowd raised his hand to Jokowi to have the president hold it.</p> <p>Turnbull is moved. The story is swelling within him.</p> <p>Why is he moved I wonder? Probably because he\u2019s a sentimental man. You do see this often. Turnbull\u2019s emotions are pretty close to the surface.</p> <p>But I wonder whether this is actually a politician and a bit of wish fulfilment. Hasn\u2019t he, after all, just articulated the secret wish of every person in elected office, to be adored by the people? The hand of the willing supplicant, raised in adoration to the great man of history? It\u2019s unknowable.</p> <p>There\u2019s no real time to wonder. We are doing what we always do on these trips. We are hurrying, only to wait. Out at the airport terminal, Jokowi regards us serenely from the wall. One of our party has fallen asleep on a coffee table. He is roused. Then we are flying through the night.</p> <h2>Berlin, 13-14 November</h2> <p>It\u2019s been 53 hours since we left our beds in Australia. Our clothes from Jakarta wear the smell of the city and ourselves and our proximity to each other.</p> <p>Our descent into Berlin brings a cluster of what Joe Hockey would have once described as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/02/wind-turbines-are-utterly-offensive-joe-hockey-tells-alan-jones\">offensive wind farms</a>. The order of the city below us reassures after the chaos of Jakarta. Doors open brings a blast of late autumn cool air that feels like a tonic.</p> <p>It also brings our new DFAT liaison person, who looks like he\u2019s stepped from the pages of a conservative gentleman\u2019s magazine: a caricature of a middle aged, cultured European. We are no longer in a hardship post. The plush mini vans purr on the tarmac.</p> <p>Into the city, and we tumble out like a group of house bound pups at the Brandenburg Gate.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bd33668f778f1bbbc462c6a453358f2c428019c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd33668f778f1bbbc462c6a453358f2c428019c5/0_200_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Malcolm Turnbull and Angela Merkel in Berlin.

We are ignoring that, politely of course. He stands aloof, but censures us with his body, which he\u2019s arranged in a stance suggestive of the hotel entrance, like a human sign.</p> <p>Finally we comply. In the foyer, colleagues bump in to <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3317718/Tom-Hanks-suits-Berlin-premiere-new-film-Bridge-Spies-wife-Rita-Wilson-shows-skin-stunning-shredded-gown.html\">Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg in Berlin for a press junket for Bridge of Spies</a>. I bump into the prime minister and his wife Lucy who are in from their power walk. Both look pleased with the morning, and our digs, and the promise of our day. Neither has seen Tom Hanks.</p> <p>Having refreshed, we are on the move to the chancellery to meet Angela Merkel, the most important figure on the continent. The Chancellery architecture is elegant. The Reichstag looms regally in the background.</p> <p>Turnbull is slightly late. Merkel, being German, is early. She walks fast with a business-like gait. Turnbull lingers, taking it all in. You can see him commit it carefully to memory.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/nov/13/malcolm-turnbull-grips-the-zeitgeist-in-his-berlin-whirl\">Malcolm Turnbull grips the zeitgeist in his Berlin whirl</a> </p> </aside>  <p>They do their talking, all build for the G20, signing off on the work that\u2019s been done for months by an advisory group intent on improving the bilateral relationship. One person in the room tells me that in their tete-a-tete Merkel reasons and explains to Turnbull with experience and emotional intelligence, which I find an interesting observation about leadership in general and about Merkel in particular given the cliche about the German chancellor being dour and impassive.</p> <p>Turnbull talks, inside and then outside at their press conference, a bit too much. There has never been a more exciting time to do anything and everything.</p> <p>Lucy Turnbull stands as sentry, elegant, formidable. What she\u2019s making of the Aussie stump speech in the chancellery is anyone\u2019s guess. Does she ever think: for God\u2019s sake, just shut up Malcolm?</p> <p>We work, then we prepare for an evening at the embassy \u2013 a standard pit stop on these trips. Turnbull pulls us down to the lobby first for an aperitif. He\u2019s full of the discoveries of the day. Collective energy is high, but our poor DFAT liaison is looking as though his world is about to end. We are due to be at the function, and these uncouth Australians are not proceeding in orderly fashion to the transport. Eventually we all bow to his acute personal discomfort. As we depart the lobby, well-heeled Germans look up from the low chairs where they are dining and socialising. We are so oversized and performative in pack formation they probably conclude we are Americans.</p> <p>The night rolls on. Business people circulate at the embassy \u2013 the suits who want to build our submarines, career diplomats, spooks, movers and shakers perverse enough to be interested in the island continent far, far away.</p> <p>Turnbull is shaking hands and eating finger food and talking about excitement, agility and disruption. I keep an eye on his circulation around the room, the deliberate arcs he\u2019s making, the habits of a lifelong networker.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"16ba7536c3b085801e85deaa38b710d04ceb63b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/16ba7536c3b085801e85deaa38b710d04ceb63b4/0_0_4267_2840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Francois Hollande addresses France after the deadly gun and bomb attacks in Paris.

We land in a pub with tall beers and meat off the bone and stodgy dumplings. We walk back to the digs to clear our heads of the day. The streets are cool and calm and full of the distant hum of a great European capital. The cool of the night soothes the wooze of the jetlag. It\u2019s so peaceful. We break in different directions in the lobby.</p> <p>In my room, and in all our rooms, the televisions would have gone on at roughly the same moment.</p> <p>And there is Paris. Another set of streets in another great European capital suddenly seized with panic and carnage.</p> <p>We are immediately in a different trip. Everything will be recast. It is not yet clear we will go to Turkey in the morning. Nothing is clear to anyone.</p> <p>A photographer friend in our party promptly packs his bag and goes to Paris, chasing the story. His alternative is dull summit shots, so a human story wins every time.</p> <p>The TV guys are required for live crosses and suit up and wire up. The rest of us watch, and wait and try to sleep.</p> <p>Turnbull, jolted out of one set of imperatives and thrust into another, works through the night.</p> <h2>Turkey, 14-16 November</h2> <p>In a room at 5am, one of Turnbull\u2019s senior advisers is telling us to be alert to the prospect of Australian casualties in Paris. No reporting yet please, this is not facts, this guidance is just prudent background. Very shortly afterwards, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/14/australian-woman-injured-in-paris-attacks-named-as-emma-jane-parkinson\">the injury of the young Tasmanian woman, Emma Grace Parkinson</a>, is confirmed.</p> <p>We are pushing on to Antalya and the G20. The only leader who is not is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/13/paris-attacks-shootings-explosions-hostages\">Francois Hollande</a>. Turnbull will take flowers to the French embassy in Berlin before we go. The prime minister records some quick reactive grabs about Paris for TV consumption back at home. No questions. He forgets to tell us about the trip to the embassy. We see the gesture later recorded in the Twitter feed of the finance minister.</p> <p>We\u2019ve lost Bold on our plane and have been given one of the young media advisers to mind shop.</p> <p>Team Turnbull is battening down the hatches to deal with events. Our collective rhythm \u2013 the trip tempo that lists intermittently between collegiality and carping, harmony and hostility \u2013 has fractured by necessity. We are in our separate spheres. We are flying into summit land.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/14/malcolm-turnbull-arrives-in-turkey-for-g20-summit\">Malcolm Turnbull arrives in Turkey for G20 summit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s not just our trip that has been recast. All the entourages flying in to Antalya airport are now flying into a different G20. The airport has been purged of all humanity in order to provide a hermetic seal to protect the visitors.</p> <p>It turns out Turnbull is staying at a hotel called the Titanic. We can\u2019t help but laugh. Later, when we clear the elaborate security, and approach the prime ministerial accommodation, it proves to be a substantial five star pile with a waterslide bolted on the edge.</p> <p>I think my eyes might be playing tricks so I ask whether anyone else sees a waterslide. I\u2019m relieved they do. All the better for those spontaneous bombs into the pool performed by visiting world leaders. The laughter punctures the lingering sense of dislocation about the last few days.</p> <p>When we see Turnbull again, his level of exhaustion is obvious. The angular planes of his face are like cliff sheers. In his first G20 bilateral with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/shinzo-abe\">Shinzo Abe</a>, he plays with his water bottle absently during a translation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d848e33ae0f395162cb7df3008f1b09cffe6a25a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d848e33ae0f395162cb7df3008f1b09cffe6a25a/167_0_2740_1745/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018When we see Turnbull again, his level of exhaustion is obvious.

What, I shriek, sitting bolt upright on the row of chairs where I have been, two minutes ago, dead to the world. What the hell? The cameraman roars laughing, mission accomplished. Serves me right.</p> <p>Turnbull is going to do a live cross to Insiders very late in the evening. We are waiting to file in time for Australians sitting down to their breakfast.</p> <p>Presumably he wants to get his post-Paris message out at home. Presumably too he wants to get his words into the domestic news cycle before <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/nov/15/malcolm-turnbull-confronts-act-of-war-message-inclusion-paris-attacks\">Tony Abbott, who is doing the Bolt Report later on Sunday morning</a>, and could easily be spoiling for trouble.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s moments like this where politicians can make real mistakes: moments of pure fatigue</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We pack up our makeshift camp and move out so the prime minister can move in to speak to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/nov/14/how-barrie-cassidy-the-ultimate-insider-charmed-his-way-to-number-one\">Barrie Cassidy</a> in Melbourne. Turnbull sweeps down the hall and past us into the recording room, staff trailing him, very slightly dishevelled, pale as the boss.</p> <p>It\u2019s moments like this where politicians can make real mistakes: moments of pure fatigue. But he doesn\u2019t make any slips. Turnbull has either been ordered by the backroom to keep relentlessly to the agreed messages, to avoid the digressions that are the function of how his head works \u2013 or he\u2019s bone tired and intuits the risks of extemporising in a time where tiredness intersects with terror.<br></p> <p>We ask for a brief press conference. In an hour the interview will be broadcast in Australia and we will already be in a fresh news cycle by the time our words fly home across the internet. Such is the relentlessness of the modern news cycle we have to push him past his as yet unbroadcast comments.</p> <p>As we\u2019ve waited for Turnbull a diligent wire reporter in our group has noticed foreign ministers in Vienna have just managed to issue a set of principles for a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/15/paris-attacks-galvanise-international-efforts-to-end-syria-war\">political transition in Syria</a>. The roadmap apparently has Russia\u2019s acquiescence.</p> <p>This is precisely what the G20 summit needs. There is a big push on for a political transition in Syria. I read this, not from Australian background briefings, but in the important newspapers of the world.</p> <p>Australia meanwhile has been gearing up for another summit, one about trade and the economy, one superseded by the existential challenge of civil war and a bloodthirsty terrorist movement and humans fleeing the cauldron of horrors.</p> <p>We mainly ask Turnbull about Vienna, and a news line emerges: we could send peacekeepers in the event the Vienna accord ever translates into reality.</p> <p>I want to ask whether Merkel or Cameron have asked him to lobby Vladimir Putin, given he is a fresh face who has never publicly threatened to shirtfront the Russian president, but the advisers shut the press conference down.</p> <p>Turnbull\u2019s policy people have not yet seen the report out of Vienna, which is mildly odd, and registers as odd, but we are tired, and racing to file, and I for one make an assumption the attention of the backroom has been diverted elsewhere. None of us are sharp enough to ask why this is news to the Turnbull backroom.</p> <p>The \u201cwhy\u201d emerges the next day in a report from The Conversation\u2019s Michelle Grattan. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/nov/16/australia-excluded-from-syria-peace-talks-after-russian-objection\">The Russians did not want us in the room at Vienna</a>. Just regional powers and the big boys, thanks very much. It\u2019s a good insight, which while not a snub, neatly underscores our middle power status.</p> <p>Turnbull\u2019s people won\u2019t blab about machinations behind the scenes \u2013 no-one in international relations tends to speak before Washington has spoken \u2013 but logical deduction suggests we are using our military contribution in the Middle East to prise our way back in to the Syrian conversation. Or we\u2019re trying, in any case.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This Turnbull office is arriving with the carpe diem tempo of the Kevin Rudd office in 2007</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There\u2019s a faint whiff of Kevin Rudd in that kind of Aussie audacity. A bit more Rudd in the arduous nature of this program.</p> <p>A bit more still in Turnbull\u2019s full tilt race for the future. Another time zone surfing internationalist with big ambitions for the country and his moment in it.</p> <p>There\u2019s a bit more Rudd in the fatigued faces of the Turnbull backroom riding the momentum of a leader with a cathartic sort of initial connection with the Australian public.</p> <p>Once, years ago, I wrote a piece where I compared Kevin Rudd\u2019s young political staff to the Lost Boys of Peter Pan. They rode into government with such energy. Not all political offices have energy. Some have stature. Some have dysfunction. Some have incompetence. This Turnbull office is arriving with the carpe diem tempo of the Rudd office in 2007.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to shake the sense I\u2019ve seen this before, except the Turnbull office has considerably more grey hair in key roles, and I suspect there\u2019s more personal loyalty here among the stayers who have seen Turnbull through his various professional bumps in the road. The stayers in his entourage can anticipate his needs and translate them from across a room.</p> <p>But it\u2019s a perishable business. I think of the Rudd office, who lived through the miserable Rudd/Gillard divorce before scattering back out into the world. Only by virtue of being round long enough to see cycles repeat, you can sense these Turnbull people trying not to look too far ahead, yet wondering all the same.</p> <p>The rest of the G20 is on the bus, off the bus, to the bilateral, from the bilateral.</p> <p>I make one big sortie into the heart of the summit zone. Barack Obama\u2019s \u201cbeast\u201d is idling in the driveway and snipers prowl on on the rooftops.</p> <p>Speeding though a designated meeting zone, I spot Cameron gripping and grinning with Abe. There\u2019s a sudden commotion in the hallway. In sweeps Putin and Xi Jinping, followed by a fawning delegation so cartoonishly large it looks like a subway attendant may be called up to shove people into the commuter tram. How the door shuts is anyone\u2019s guess.</p> <p>Turnbull barely makes eye contact with our reporter\u2019s pool as he powers through to meet Modi of India.</p> <p>They have really disappeared into the locked box of this place. Communication is a bit erratic, and incipient fractiousness between the spinners and the scribes starts to bubble.</p> <p>Bold, the human shock absorber, absorbs the angst and all the gratuitous advice about how he could be a better slave to our whims with his usual implacable calm.</p> <p>I step briefly out of my transactional self to make a mental note that he\u2019s strictly humouring here \u2013 he will stick with the program of the boss without feeling the pressure of conforming to our rituals and our demands, many of them petty and perishable.</p> <p>Then I notice Bold is swaying, ever so slightly, his thumb twitching over his phones. His professional mask is fixed, the affability unshakeable, but his body is starting to give him feedback that this is all a bit stretched tight.</p> <p> He\u2019s just waiting patiently, presumably in the entirely reasonable hope we will shut up and leave.</p> <p>We leave him with the snipers standing with his two smart phones by an oversized water park which looks a little like Disney World on the Mediterranean.</p> <p>I give him the dignity of not turning around to check whether he sits down once we are safely away.</p> <h2>Manila, 17-19 November</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"02d3b95370cbbda88ca7ad32ea33e7578eca474d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/02d3b95370cbbda88ca7ad32ea33e7578eca474d/0_0_4928_3280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Justin Trudeau waves to members of the media and summit volunteers as he leaves after a press conference at the Apec summit in Manila.

In Manila, it is <a href=\"http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2015/11/19/justin-trudeau-mobbed-by-shrieking-fans-in-manila.html\">the new Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau</a>.</p> <p>Australian journalists are idling like parked cars in the foyer of the Peninsula Hotel, which is festooned with premature Christmas decorations. A small orchestral ensemble pumps out carols and pop ballads on a mezzanine balcony above our heads. Right now they are playing Bryan Adams.</p> <p>We are waiting for Turnbull but soon learn everyone else milling about in the foyer is WFT: waiting for Trudeau. Soon enough the doors sweep open and the new man in Canada strides in to the foyer in the full expectation that a crowd will be waiting for his entrance. Trudeau pauses momentarily like royalty before lifting his arm high in salutation.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Trudeau hasn\u2019t even scanned the room before the royal wave</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Trudeau hasn\u2019t even scanned the room before the royal wave. As far as he knows, he could be gesturing to no one, but here is a person entirely conditioned to public life, like a supermodel who knows how to work the light or an actor hitting his mark.</p> <p>I burst out laughing at this supreme self-confidence. An Australian prime minister would never approach a room with such a relaxed sense of entitlement.</p> <p>I remember Turnbull, back in Jakarta with that anecdote about the child\u2019s spontaneous devotion to Jokowi. <em>My people, my people</em>. Eva Perons in their secret hearts, all of them.</p> <p>At the other end of the spectrum is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/key-john\">John Key.</a> I miss this event but colleagues later report that shortly after Trudeau, a hotel guest is spotted in the foyer in his bathrobe.</p> <p>This guest turns out to be the New Zealand prime minister, who is coming back barefoot, terry towelling loosely knotted, from the hotel pool.</p> <p>After they recover their equanimity (prime ministers in bathrobes in public thoroughfares are, let\u2019s face it, a reasonably rare sight), my colleagues subject Key to a quick interrogation. How do you like Turnbull, one asks? \u201cHe\u2019s a bolter,\u201d Key replies, cheerfully.</p> <p>Languid in different fashion is Barack Obama, our first official port of call in Manila. To get to him we must enter the Apec security zone, then enter the American security zone, which includes an x-ray truck the Americans have flown in to inspect any vehicle with the temerity to enter their locked down area near the Soffitel.</p> <p>Then we must enter the enormous purpose built tent the Americans have constructed on the grounds of the Sofitel to conduct their business. The Americans have arrived for Apec en masse like nomadic desert princes making camp on Manila Bay, except this is not conformance with ancient custom, my working assumption is they are avoiding any prospect of being bugged.</p> <p>The Americans want us all to line up for the bilateral in single file, with cameras first, then TV journalists then print. I don\u2019t tell them I\u2019m digital for fear of any abstract unintended consequences, ranging from extraordinary rendition to being told to sit in the foyer until after the bilat.</p> <p>Orderliness is a worthy aspiration. Problem is Australians just don\u2019t line up. I ask our fresh faced American wrangler whether this is some quaint American custom: a daily procession of obedience. His presence in a hardship post, coupled with the resigned expression, suggests I\u2019m not the first Australian smart arse he\u2019s encountered. \u201cIt just looks nicer on the broadcast,\u201d he says, patiently.</p> <p>Naturally it is beyond our collective capacity to be orderly. A few more attempts are made, with added shooshing, before the process is abandoned. To be fair, the Americans are not obeying either. They, like us, have flown in overnight from Turkey. Perhaps we are all wandering around like Brown\u2019s cows to stave off deep vein thrombosis. \u201cChrist I need a shower,\u201d one rumpled print man says to another.</p> <p>We burst in as the door opens. Obama has that elegant looped limb position you\u2019ve seen a thousand times in bilaterals from around the world. His hands don\u2019t open, the long fingers rather unfurl and frame a cheekbone.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/video/2015/nov/19/malcolm-turnbull-holds-discussions-with-barack-obama-in-manila-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4ebhh\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2409821\"            data-video-name=\"Obama catches Malcolm Turnbull off-guard with invitation to Washington \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"ABC\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-564d745ae4b0e0595dc6cafe\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/11/19/151119TunrbullObama_1_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2015/11/19/151119TunrbullObama_1_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/11/19/151119TunrbullObama_1.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2015/11/19/151119TunrbullObama_1_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/11/19/151119TunrbullObama_1_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/video/2015/nov/19/malcolm-turnbull-holds-discussions-with-barack-obama-in-manila-video\">Obama catches Malcolm Turnbull off-guard with invitation to Washington</a>. Source: ABC</figcaption> </figure>   <p>When we are all in position, the US president speaks very quietly, like it is our job to lean in in order to hear what is being said. The American president is always heard, with or without amplification, because the world has been conditioned to lean in.</p> <p>Turnbull listens politely and doesn\u2019t fidget. But as soon as the Obama spiel has concluded he smiles, flicking the hem of his suit coat as if he might leap up and deliver a closing submission to an international tribunal.</p> <p>Turnbull then projects like an operatic tenor to the back of the room. This is the only way an Australian prime minister ever gets heard: by speaking up.</p> <p>Obama, like everyone, gets the Turnbull stump speech. As usual, he speaks too long. The president responds with absolute poker face, and periodic nod of affirmation. Lecturing an American about the wonders of technological disruption is a little like lecturing Eskimos about the utility of ice, but that\u2019s the spiel. I picture Obama and Merkel texting one another. BO: What is it about this new Aussie and the obsession with the relative youthfulness of Microsoft? AM: You tell me, Barrie. PS: Take your bugs when you leave this time.</p> <p>Later that night, Turnbull is back with us at the hotel. He looks much better, out of the worst of that gruelling time between Berlin and Antayla. The effort they are making to keep in touch during the trip shouldn\u2019t be underestimated. Speaking to us regularly costs him preparation time, or rest. The contact with him is not even really spin, for him these sessions runs like live feedback. What did we all think, how did it look. Rather than framing his actions, he\u2019s surveilling us in a way, watching our habits. Individuals he knows, the valuable intelligence for him is the dynamic of the group.</p> <p>The foreign minister, Julie Bishop, is by his side. They are dining together tonight.</p> <p>Bishop is attentive and rigorously on the clock while feigning she\u2019s participating in a spontaneously convivial social wind down. Politicians spend their lives in these social situations with everyone wanting a piece of them so they learn to both project and withhold, usually simultaneously. Women always have to be better, sharper, more guarded, more dexterous than the men in line before them.<br></p> <p>A beverage slips and drenches her shoes. She doesn\u2019t miss a beat, continuing the conversation while dabbing at the shoe, which comes off to dry. She balances on one stiletto with ease.</p> <p>Turnbull talks, she regards him out of the corner of her eye while maintaining her own flow of conversation. I suspect this multi-channelling is a skill she\u2019s acquired in her diplomatic portfolio, although it\u2019s got a touch of the managing partner about it as well. Does he know she\u2019s watching him and and talking to someone else at the same time? Does he feel her attention, or is this something only another woman would detect because a man, particularly a powerful one, would just assume all the attention is trained on him.</p> <p>I wonder if her affable vigilance is a kind of shorthand between them, a constant reminder not to overshare. Standing in this room in Manila, they are a human check and balance.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/18/apec-summit-malcolm-turnbull-says-syria-solution-hinges-on-power-sharing\">Apec summit: Malcolm Turnbull says Syria solution hinges on power sharing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Neither over share, nothing out of school, but they set up various arguments they will make publicly and in some detail the next day about the political transition in Syria. Nothing explosive. All pretty obvious, but when surrounded by the great powers, it\u2019s always best for the middle powers to mind their manners and let the grownups speak first. Probably best too to have journalists prepared if you want to launch into complex material they may or may not be across.</p> <p>The subject of the Thucydides trap \u2013 where an existing superpower feels threatened by an emerging power \u2013 comes up. This might seem odd but in any conversation with the prime minister, the Athenian general is often not far away. Great power and rising power tensions is the highly specific universe we are inhabiting at this particular Apec, wedged between China and America, and the ancient Greeks knew something of that dynamic.</p> <p>President Xi has made speeches referencing the phenomenon known as the Thucydides trap in analysing China\u2019s place in the world. Last year Xi said \u201cwe all need to work together to avoid the Thucydides trap \u2013 destructive tensions between an emerging power and established powers\u201d. </p> <p>Xi\u2019s public statements prompt me to wonder whether Turnbull and the Chinese president could, bizarrely, bond over something as random as Thucydides. It\u2019s a funny universe, the highly managed and mediated universe world leaders inhabit.</p> <p>We are all searching for our various connection points, managing our competing imperatives and friction points.

He wanders past with his staff. As I\u2019m bidding farewell to an Australian official Key knows well, the NZ PM stops and I have opportunity introduce myself. Culturally he\u2019s very familiar.</p> <p>He has a laugh about the internet going crazy with a comment from Obama that was picked up by a boom mic during the leaders meeting. \u201cSo, you, er, actually talk to the New Zealanders,\u201d Obama is heard saying to Turnbull. Turnbull responds earnestly. Of course he does. Key is a role model. Obama cracks up, telling the Australian he and Key are great pals. Golfing buddies in fact.</p> <p>Key thinks this is hilarious. He whips out his smart phone to show me this story is currently the lead on the major news website in New Zealand. A good day, the New Zealander thinks, quite the lark. Well fed and internet famous, Key moves on.</p> <p>Turnbull is on his way to the final summit. Key is about the follow him. The Australian officials are folding their camp in Manila.

          "bodyText": "Jakarta, 12 November Departure from the Royal Australian Air Force base in Canberra. The media flies before the prime minister who catches up later in a faster plane. The uniformed chaps with the high-gloss shoes greet everyone, this time at 3am, with a cheery good morning. Because it happens to be 3am this greeting is accompanied with laughter. The \u201cat you\u201d kind, not the \u201cwith you\u201d kind. It\u2019s a typical departure in that everyone has a stress point. You can feel the centres of stress pulsing around the terminal. One colleague\u2019s dog has vomited profusely in the kitchen. Another frets this is the best we are going to feel for at least a week. In the blink of an eye we are wheels up, then a brief panic ensues when it appears two passports have been left behind. No drama, the passports are located. TV crews huddle in the aisles and talk logistics. Fitful sleep is had. In what feels a short space of time we are thudding on the tarmac in the Indonesian capital. The heat hits like a fan-forced oven. Our liaison person from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, hovering with intent at the bottom of the stairs, is from the take-no-prisoners school, cheerful and practical, all precision, like the RAAF. We are blasting through Jakarta traffic with a police escort with a program in our hands which is locked down to the footnotes. Pretty shortly it\u2019s obvious why. Everything in Jakarta contains an element of mystery. The government and its apparatus does what it does. There is always the potential for things to slide off the rails. A fixed program must be reassuring in a post where mild incomprehension or outright frustration is occupational risk. Having spent weeks nailing the program, DFAT (of course) thinks we are doing the program. Malcolm Turnbull (of course) has a different idea. When he lands, he\u2019d like to do a short press conference. One senses the distinct sound of silent screams from the advancers. One can only sense the scream because the poker face is absolute. It\u2019s an odd call by the prime minister. By speaking to the media before the events today, and with the time difference, at least for print editions and the TV news, he\u2019s just made our one day in Jakarta actually about the rats-and-mice domestic political issues back at home. I wonder if he gets that? New boy. Rookie error. Given we are in Jakarta so the Australian government can reset one of our most important foreign policy relationships, you\u2019d think we\u2019d keep our collective line of sight on that. We roar on to the presidential palace, which is a marvellous building in the grand colonial style. No-one in our media entourage is entirely sure what is happening because guidance is vague. The Indonesian media have been well briefed and swim like a school of fish in elegant formation. We visitors try to plug into the slipstream but lack a certain confidence. Confusion is inevitable. There will be no remarks by Turnbull and his Indonesian host, someone tells us, which is awkward, given that\u2019s actually what we came for. On the strength of that advice, most of the Australian press pack departs the scene. Later we learn there have indeed been remarks, which have to be chased. David Bold, Turnbull\u2019s senior media adviser, is a young man but an old soul. He\u2019s from the human shock absorber school of press secretary, which in the combative world of Canberra in recent years, is a bit of a throwback. One suspects Bold could emerge from a nuclear blast, straighten his tie, and suggest we all go to the bar for a martini, but even he\u2019s looking mildly disconcerted by Jakarta\u2019s lack of fixed points, nothing is shared, but a little wrinkle forms between the eyes. After the formalities at the palace, Joko Widodo and Turnbull go to a local textile market for a walk through \u2013 a \u201cdown with the people\u201d opportunity the Indonesian president has never offered another world leader. David Cameron walked here, but on his own. Much is made of this generosity. \u201cWonderful. Totemic.\u201d Less is made of the fact the walk was actually the idea of the Australian ambassador, Paul Grigson, and the Indonesians have agreed, doubtless for their own domestic motivations. Arriving at the market is a shock. Turnbull\u2019s police detail take one look at the market and their profound objection to this outing is written all over their stony faces. You feel their attentiveness level climb by several notches. I wait for the politicians at the bottom of a flight of steps. The crowd is swelling all around me, like a rising tide. It keeps coming, filling, spilling outwards, lapping the corners. The smart phones are out, children are being thrust forward. There are too many people in this space. Too many blind corners. In theory, in the program, this event is a choreographed media opportunity, benign as hell. In reality we are right on the edge of the unknowable. Turnbull senses the deep crazy as soon as he arrives. It\u2019s baking hot. The leaders\u2019 jackets come off. The Indonesian foreign minister grabs some paper towels for Turnbull, who is erupting like a drinking fountain. Jokowi of course is dry as a desert, and serene, executing one of his rituals. The Indonesian security presence suddenly materialises and asserts itself, (where did they come from, so many of them) pushing people back, aggressively, particularly Australian cameras. I\u2019m pushed back courtesy of someone being pushed into me and lose control of my own motion. It\u2019s like being dumped in the surf. The prime minister catches sight of me being tossed about. I can see his range of emotions immediately. Right now he is hovering on the edge of this sortie being complete insanity and the absolute best thing he\u2019s ever experienced. Both feelings are there, behind his smiling sweaty face. \u201cBeen for a bit of shopping Murpharoo?\u201d Turnbull says, drolly. A TV man swings in an arc to get out of the way of the people tide and clocks a security man with his camera. There\u2019s a sharp collective intake of breath, we all freeze for a moment, but instead of getting handcuffs, the Indonesian extends his hand in forgiveness. We make it out, and settle ourselves with a quick drink in the holding hotel. Turnbull is ebullient. Disaster or best thing ever? Well, it\u2019s the latter of course. And it was an incredible experience. He tells us he was so moved when a little boy in the crowd raised his hand to Jokowi to have the president hold it. Turnbull is moved. The story is swelling within him. Why is he moved I wonder? Probably because he\u2019s a sentimental man. You do see this often. Turnbull\u2019s emotions are pretty close to the surface. But I wonder whether this is actually a politician and a bit of wish fulfilment. Hasn\u2019t he, after all, just articulated the secret wish of every person in elected office, to be adored by the people? The hand of the willing supplicant, raised in adoration to the great man of history? It\u2019s unknowable. There\u2019s no real time to wonder. We are doing what we always do on these trips. We are hurrying, only to wait. Out at the airport terminal, Jokowi regards us serenely from the wall. One of our party has fallen asleep on a coffee table. He is roused. Then we are flying through the night. Berlin, 13-14 November It\u2019s been 53 hours since we left our beds in Australia. Our clothes from Jakarta wear the smell of the city and ourselves and our proximity to each other. Our descent into Berlin brings a cluster of what Joe Hockey would have once described as offensive wind farms. The order of the city below us reassures after the chaos of Jakarta. Doors open brings a blast of late autumn cool air that feels like a tonic. It also brings our new DFAT liaison person, who looks like he\u2019s stepped from the pages of a conservative gentleman\u2019s magazine: a caricature of a middle aged, cultured European. We are no longer in a hardship post. The plush mini vans purr on the tarmac. Into the city, and we tumble out like a group of house bound pups at the Brandenburg Gate. Sure there\u2019s a monument there, but our local liaison would very much like us to keep moving. We are ignoring that, politely of course. He stands aloof, but censures us with his body, which he\u2019s arranged in a stance suggestive of the hotel entrance, like a human sign. Finally we comply. In the foyer, colleagues bump in to Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg in Berlin for a press junket for Bridge of Spies. I bump into the prime minister and his wife Lucy who are in from their power walk. Both look pleased with the morning, and our digs, and the promise of our day. Neither has seen Tom Hanks. Having refreshed, we are on the move to the chancellery to meet Angela Merkel, the most important figure on the continent. The Chancellery architecture is elegant. The Reichstag looms regally in the background. Turnbull is slightly late. Merkel, being German, is early. She walks fast with a business-like gait. Turnbull lingers, taking it all in. You can see him commit it carefully to memory. They do their talking, all build for the G20, signing off on the work that\u2019s been done for months by an advisory group intent on improving the bilateral relationship. One person in the room tells me that in their tete-a-tete Merkel reasons and explains to Turnbull with experience and emotional intelligence, which I find an interesting observation about leadership in general and about Merkel in particular given the cliche about the German chancellor being dour and impassive. Turnbull talks, inside and then outside at their press conference, a bit too much. There has never been a more exciting time to do anything and everything. Lucy Turnbull stands as sentry, elegant, formidable. What she\u2019s making of the Aussie stump speech in the chancellery is anyone\u2019s guess. Does she ever think: for God\u2019s sake, just shut up Malcolm? We work, then we prepare for an evening at the embassy \u2013 a standard pit stop on these trips. Turnbull pulls us down to the lobby first for an aperitif. He\u2019s full of the discoveries of the day. Collective energy is high, but our poor DFAT liaison is looking as though his world is about to end. We are due to be at the function, and these uncouth Australians are not proceeding in orderly fashion to the transport. Eventually we all bow to his acute personal discomfort. As we depart the lobby, well-heeled Germans look up from the low chairs where they are dining and socialising. We are so oversized and performative in pack formation they probably conclude we are Americans. The night rolls on. Business people circulate at the embassy \u2013 the suits who want to build our submarines, career diplomats, spooks, movers and shakers perverse enough to be interested in the island continent far, far away. Turnbull is shaking hands and eating finger food and talking about excitement, agility and disruption. I keep an eye on his circulation around the room, the deliberate arcs he\u2019s making, the habits of a lifelong networker. A bunch of us eventually move on to eat. We land in a pub with tall beers and meat off the bone and stodgy dumplings. We walk back to the digs to clear our heads of the day. The streets are cool and calm and full of the distant hum of a great European capital. The cool of the night soothes the wooze of the jetlag. It\u2019s so peaceful. We break in different directions in the lobby. In my room, and in all our rooms, the televisions would have gone on at roughly the same moment. And there is Paris. Another set of streets in another great European capital suddenly seized with panic and carnage. We are immediately in a different trip. Everything will be recast. It is not yet clear we will go to Turkey in the morning. Nothing is clear to anyone. A photographer friend in our party promptly packs his bag and goes to Paris, chasing the story. His alternative is dull summit shots, so a human story wins every time. The TV guys are required for live crosses and suit up and wire up. The rest of us watch, and wait and try to sleep. Turnbull, jolted out of one set of imperatives and thrust into another, works through the night. Turkey, 14-16 November In a room at 5am, one of Turnbull\u2019s senior advisers is telling us to be alert to the prospect of Australian casualties in Paris. No reporting yet please, this is not facts, this guidance is just prudent background. Very shortly afterwards, the injury of the young Tasmanian woman, Emma Grace Parkinson, is confirmed. We are pushing on to Antalya and the G20. The only leader who is not is Francois Hollande. Turnbull will take flowers to the French embassy in Berlin before we go. The prime minister records some quick reactive grabs about Paris for TV consumption back at home. No questions. He forgets to tell us about the trip to the embassy. We see the gesture later recorded in the Twitter feed of the finance minister. We\u2019ve lost Bold on our plane and have been given one of the young media advisers to mind shop. Team Turnbull is battening down the hatches to deal with events. Our collective rhythm \u2013 the trip tempo that lists intermittently between collegiality and carping, harmony and hostility \u2013 has fractured by necessity. We are in our separate spheres. We are flying into summit land. It\u2019s not just our trip that has been recast. All the entourages flying in to Antalya airport are now flying into a different G20. The airport has been purged of all humanity in order to provide a hermetic seal to protect the visitors. It turns out Turnbull is staying at a hotel called the Titanic. We can\u2019t help but laugh. Later, when we clear the elaborate security, and approach the prime ministerial accommodation, it proves to be a substantial five star pile with a waterslide bolted on the edge. I think my eyes might be playing tricks so I ask whether anyone else sees a waterslide. I\u2019m relieved they do. All the better for those spontaneous bombs into the pool performed by visiting world leaders. The laughter punctures the lingering sense of dislocation about the last few days. When we see Turnbull again, his level of exhaustion is obvious. The angular planes of his face are like cliff sheers. In his first G20 bilateral with Shinzo Abe, he plays with his water bottle absently during a translation. The TV crews come back from the Abe bilateral and one cameraman tells me there was nothing in the conversation, except something about the awarding of a multibillion dollar submarine contract but he didn\u2019t quite catch it. What, I shriek, sitting bolt upright on the row of chairs where I have been, two minutes ago, dead to the world. What the hell? The cameraman roars laughing, mission accomplished. Serves me right. Turnbull is going to do a live cross to Insiders very late in the evening. We are waiting to file in time for Australians sitting down to their breakfast. Presumably he wants to get his post-Paris message out at home. Presumably too he wants to get his words into the domestic news cycle before Tony Abbott, who is doing the Bolt Report later on Sunday morning, and could easily be spoiling for trouble. We pack up our makeshift camp and move out so the prime minister can move in to speak to Barrie Cassidy in Melbourne. Turnbull sweeps down the hall and past us into the recording room, staff trailing him, very slightly dishevelled, pale as the boss. It\u2019s moments like this where politicians can make real mistakes: moments of pure fatigue. But he doesn\u2019t make any slips. Turnbull has either been ordered by the backroom to keep relentlessly to the agreed messages, to avoid the digressions that are the function of how his head works \u2013 or he\u2019s bone tired and intuits the risks of extemporising in a time where tiredness intersects with terror. We ask for a brief press conference. In an hour the interview will be broadcast in Australia and we will already be in a fresh news cycle by the time our words fly home across the internet. Such is the relentlessness of the modern news cycle we have to push him past his as yet unbroadcast comments. As we\u2019ve waited for Turnbull a diligent wire reporter in our group has noticed foreign ministers in Vienna have just managed to issue a set of principles for a political transition in Syria. The roadmap apparently has Russia\u2019s acquiescence. This is precisely what the G20 summit needs. There is a big push on for a political transition in Syria. I read this, not from Australian background briefings, but in the important newspapers of the world. Australia meanwhile has been gearing up for another summit, one about trade and the economy, one superseded by the existential challenge of civil war and a bloodthirsty terrorist movement and humans fleeing the cauldron of horrors. We mainly ask Turnbull about Vienna, and a news line emerges: we could send peacekeepers in the event the Vienna accord ever translates into reality. I want to ask whether Merkel or Cameron have asked him to lobby Vladimir Putin, given he is a fresh face who has never publicly threatened to shirtfront the Russian president, but the advisers shut the press conference down. Turnbull\u2019s policy people have not yet seen the report out of Vienna, which is mildly odd, and registers as odd, but we are tired, and racing to file, and I for one make an assumption the attention of the backroom has been diverted elsewhere. None of us are sharp enough to ask why this is news to the Turnbull backroom. The \u201cwhy\u201d emerges the next day in a report from The Conversation\u2019s Michelle Grattan. The Russians did not want us in the room at Vienna. Just regional powers and the big boys, thanks very much. It\u2019s a good insight, which while not a snub, neatly underscores our middle power status. Turnbull\u2019s people won\u2019t blab about machinations behind the scenes \u2013 no-one in international relations tends to speak before Washington has spoken \u2013 but logical deduction suggests we are using our military contribution in the Middle East to prise our way back in to the Syrian conversation. Or we\u2019re trying, in any case. There\u2019s a faint whiff of Kevin Rudd in that kind of Aussie audacity. A bit more Rudd in the arduous nature of this program. A bit more still in Turnbull\u2019s full tilt race for the future. Another time zone surfing internationalist with big ambitions for the country and his moment in it. There\u2019s a bit more Rudd in the fatigued faces of the Turnbull backroom riding the momentum of a leader with a cathartic sort of initial connection with the Australian public. Once, years ago, I wrote a piece where I compared Kevin Rudd\u2019s young political staff to the Lost Boys of Peter Pan. They rode into government with such energy. Not all political offices have energy. Some have stature. Some have dysfunction. Some have incompetence. This Turnbull office is arriving with the carpe diem tempo of the Rudd office in 2007. It\u2019s hard to shake the sense I\u2019ve seen this before, except the Turnbull office has considerably more grey hair in key roles, and I suspect there\u2019s more personal loyalty here among the stayers who have seen Turnbull through his various professional bumps in the road. The stayers in his entourage can anticipate his needs and translate them from across a room. But it\u2019s a perishable business. I think of the Rudd office, who lived through the miserable Rudd/Gillard divorce before scattering back out into the world. Only by virtue of being round long enough to see cycles repeat, you can sense these Turnbull people trying not to look too far ahead, yet wondering all the same. The rest of the G20 is on the bus, off the bus, to the bilateral, from the bilateral. I make one big sortie into the heart of the summit zone. Barack Obama\u2019s \u201cbeast\u201d is idling in the driveway and snipers prowl on on the rooftops. Speeding though a designated meeting zone, I spot Cameron gripping and grinning with Abe. There\u2019s a sudden commotion in the hallway. In sweeps Putin and Xi Jinping, followed by a fawning delegation so cartoonishly large it looks like a subway attendant may be called up to shove people into the commuter tram. How the door shuts is anyone\u2019s guess. Turnbull barely makes eye contact with our reporter\u2019s pool as he powers through to meet Modi of India. They have really disappeared into the locked box of this place. Communication is a bit erratic, and incipient fractiousness between the spinners and the scribes starts to bubble. Bold, the human shock absorber, absorbs the angst and all the gratuitous advice about how he could be a better slave to our whims with his usual implacable calm. I step briefly out of my transactional self to make a mental note that he\u2019s strictly humouring here \u2013 he will stick with the program of the boss without feeling the pressure of conforming to our rituals and our demands, many of them petty and perishable. Then I notice Bold is swaying, ever so slightly, his thumb twitching over his phones. His professional mask is fixed, the affability unshakeable, but his body is starting to give him feedback that this is all a bit stretched tight. He\u2019s just waiting patiently, presumably in the entirely reasonable hope we will shut up and leave. We leave him with the snipers standing with his two smart phones by an oversized water park which looks a little like Disney World on the Mediterranean. I give him the dignity of not turning around to check whether he sits down once we are safely away. Manila, 17-19 November In Berlin, the resident hotel celebrities were Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg. In Manila, it is the new Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau. Australian journalists are idling like parked cars in the foyer of the Peninsula Hotel, which is festooned with premature Christmas decorations. A small orchestral ensemble pumps out carols and pop ballads on a mezzanine balcony above our heads. Right now they are playing Bryan Adams. We are waiting for Turnbull but soon learn everyone else milling about in the foyer is WFT: waiting for Trudeau. Soon enough the doors sweep open and the new man in Canada strides in to the foyer in the full expectation that a crowd will be waiting for his entrance. Trudeau pauses momentarily like royalty before lifting his arm high in salutation. Trudeau hasn\u2019t even scanned the room before the royal wave. As far as he knows, he could be gesturing to no one, but here is a person entirely conditioned to public life, like a supermodel who knows how to work the light or an actor hitting his mark. I burst out laughing at this supreme self-confidence. An Australian prime minister would never approach a room with such a relaxed sense of entitlement. I remember Turnbull, back in Jakarta with that anecdote about the child\u2019s spontaneous devotion to Jokowi. My people, my people. Eva Perons in their secret hearts, all of them. At the other end of the spectrum is John Key. I miss this event but colleagues later report that shortly after Trudeau, a hotel guest is spotted in the foyer in his bathrobe. This guest turns out to be the New Zealand prime minister, who is coming back barefoot, terry towelling loosely knotted, from the hotel pool. After they recover their equanimity (prime ministers in bathrobes in public thoroughfares are, let\u2019s face it, a reasonably rare sight), my colleagues subject Key to a quick interrogation. How do you like Turnbull, one asks? \u201cHe\u2019s a bolter,\u201d Key replies, cheerfully. Languid in different fashion is Barack Obama, our first official port of call in Manila. To get to him we must enter the Apec security zone, then enter the American security zone, which includes an x-ray truck the Americans have flown in to inspect any vehicle with the temerity to enter their locked down area near the Soffitel. Then we must enter the enormous purpose built tent the Americans have constructed on the grounds of the Sofitel to conduct their business. The Americans have arrived for Apec en masse like nomadic desert princes making camp on Manila Bay, except this is not conformance with ancient custom, my working assumption is they are avoiding any prospect of being bugged. The Americans want us all to line up for the bilateral in single file, with cameras first, then TV journalists then print. I don\u2019t tell them I\u2019m digital for fear of any abstract unintended consequences, ranging from extraordinary rendition to being told to sit in the foyer until after the bilat. Orderliness is a worthy aspiration. Problem is Australians just don\u2019t line up. I ask our fresh faced American wrangler whether this is some quaint American custom: a daily procession of obedience. His presence in a hardship post, coupled with the resigned expression, suggests I\u2019m not the first Australian smart arse he\u2019s encountered. \u201cIt just looks nicer on the broadcast,\u201d he says, patiently. Naturally it is beyond our collective capacity to be orderly. A few more attempts are made, with added shooshing, before the process is abandoned. To be fair, the Americans are not obeying either. They, like us, have flown in overnight from Turkey. Perhaps we are all wandering around like Brown\u2019s cows to stave off deep vein thrombosis. \u201cChrist I need a shower,\u201d one rumpled print man says to another. We burst in as the door opens. Obama has that elegant looped limb position you\u2019ve seen a thousand times in bilaterals from around the world. His hands don\u2019t open, the long fingers rather unfurl and frame a cheekbone. When we are all in position, the US president speaks very quietly, like it is our job to lean in in order to hear what is being said. The American president is always heard, with or without amplification, because the world has been conditioned to lean in. Turnbull listens politely and doesn\u2019t fidget. But as soon as the Obama spiel has concluded he smiles, flicking the hem of his suit coat as if he might leap up and deliver a closing submission to an international tribunal. Turnbull then projects like an operatic tenor to the back of the room. This is the only way an Australian prime minister ever gets heard: by speaking up. Obama, like everyone, gets the Turnbull stump speech. As usual, he speaks too long. The president responds with absolute poker face, and periodic nod of affirmation. Lecturing an American about the wonders of technological disruption is a little like lecturing Eskimos about the utility of ice, but that\u2019s the spiel. I picture Obama and Merkel texting one another. BO: What is it about this new Aussie and the obsession with the relative youthfulness of Microsoft? AM: You tell me, Barrie. PS: Take your bugs when you leave this time. Later that night, Turnbull is back with us at the hotel. He looks much better, out of the worst of that gruelling time between Berlin and Antayla. The effort they are making to keep in touch during the trip shouldn\u2019t be underestimated. Speaking to us regularly costs him preparation time, or rest. The contact with him is not even really spin, for him these sessions runs like live feedback. What did we all think, how did it look. Rather than framing his actions, he\u2019s surveilling us in a way, watching our habits. Individuals he knows, the valuable intelligence for him is the dynamic of the group. The foreign minister, Julie Bishop, is by his side. They are dining together tonight. Bishop is attentive and rigorously on the clock while feigning she\u2019s participating in a spontaneously convivial social wind down. Politicians spend their lives in these social situations with everyone wanting a piece of them so they learn to both project and withhold, usually simultaneously. Women always have to be better, sharper, more guarded, more dexterous than the men in line before them. A beverage slips and drenches her shoes. She doesn\u2019t miss a beat, continuing the conversation while dabbing at the shoe, which comes off to dry. She balances on one stiletto with ease. Turnbull talks, she regards him out of the corner of her eye while maintaining her own flow of conversation. I suspect this multi-channelling is a skill she\u2019s acquired in her diplomatic portfolio, although it\u2019s got a touch of the managing partner about it as well. Does he know she\u2019s watching him and and talking to someone else at the same time? Does he feel her attention, or is this something only another woman would detect because a man, particularly a powerful one, would just assume all the attention is trained on him. I wonder if her affable vigilance is a kind of shorthand between them, a constant reminder not to overshare. Standing in this room in Manila, they are a human check and balance. Neither over share, nothing out of school, but they set up various arguments they will make publicly and in some detail the next day about the political transition in Syria. Nothing explosive. All pretty obvious, but when surrounded by the great powers, it\u2019s always best for the middle powers to mind their manners and let the grownups speak first. Probably best too to have journalists prepared if you want to launch into complex material they may or may not be across. The subject of the Thucydides trap \u2013 where an existing superpower feels threatened by an emerging power \u2013 comes up. This might seem odd but in any conversation with the prime minister, the Athenian general is often not far away. Great power and rising power tensions is the highly specific universe we are inhabiting at this particular Apec, wedged between China and America, and the ancient Greeks knew something of that dynamic. President Xi has made speeches referencing the phenomenon known as the Thucydides trap in analysing China\u2019s place in the world. Last year Xi said \u201cwe all need to work together to avoid the Thucydides trap \u2013 destructive tensions between an emerging power and established powers\u201d. Xi\u2019s public statements prompt me to wonder whether Turnbull and the Chinese president could, bizarrely, bond over something as random as Thucydides. It\u2019s a funny universe, the highly managed and mediated universe world leaders inhabit. We are all searching for our various connection points, managing our competing imperatives and friction points. Turnbull in his bilaterals. The scribes with the prime minister and officials \u2013 them with us. Working through these social rituals. Apec, meanwhile, rolls on. Trudeau continues with his spectacular hotel entrances. When I glance up from a conversation, he\u2019s indulging a mass selfie in front of the hotel Christmas tree. I get my own moment with John Key, fully clothed, in a restaurant at the hotel. He wanders past with his staff. As I\u2019m bidding farewell to an Australian official Key knows well, the NZ PM stops and I have opportunity introduce myself. Culturally he\u2019s very familiar. He has a laugh about the internet going crazy with a comment from Obama that was picked up by a boom mic during the leaders meeting. \u201cSo, you, er, actually talk to the New Zealanders,\u201d Obama is heard saying to Turnbull. Turnbull responds earnestly. Of course he does. Key is a role model. Obama cracks up, telling the Australian he and Key are great pals. Golfing buddies in fact. Key thinks this is hilarious. He whips out his smart phone to show me this story is currently the lead on the major news website in New Zealand. A good day, the New Zealander thinks, quite the lark. Well fed and internet famous, Key moves on. Turnbull is on his way to the final summit. Key is about the follow him. The Australian officials are folding their camp in Manila. Some are returning to Australia. It\u2019s time to go home.",

More than 230,000 Syrians have applied for asylum across the EU this year, and nearly 45% of these applications have been lodged in Germany alone. Nearly 80,000 Syrians have been granted asylum in the EU so far this year. But the figure for migrants granted asylum does not reveal the full scale of the number of people that some European countries are welcoming. Filing and processing paperwork takes time. For example, between January and October, Germany registered the arrival of 243,721 asylum seekers from Syria. The country expects to receive more than a million asylum seekers this year. Canada resettled 3,089 Syrian refugees between 1 January 2014 and 3 November 2015. However, recently elected prime minister Justin Trudeau has committed to resettling 25,000 Syrians by the end of the year. Are Syrian refugees likely to be Isis sympathizers? Syrian refugees are generally afraid of exactly the same thing that Americans are: Islamist terrorism. Many are fleeing areas held by the Islamic State, and they are doing so in contravention of Isis edicts. On a dozen occasions, Isis has condemned refugees for fleeing Isis areas. \u201cFor those who want to blame the attacks on Paris on refugees, you might want to get your facts straight,\u201d wrote Aaron Zelin, an analyst of jihadis, in a blogpost. \u201cThe reality is, [Isis] loathes that individuals are fleeing Syria for Europe. It undermines [Isis\u2019s] message that its self-styled Caliphate is a refuge.\u201d By rejecting Syrian refugees, American governors are in fact helping Isis, because they are proving Isis\u2019s argument that the west does not want to assist Syrian Muslims, and that their only salvation lies in Isis. \u201cSyrian and Iraqi refugees are the victims of terrorism, fleeing the same type of atrocities that we\u2019ve recently witnessed,\u201d said Shelly Pitterman, of the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) on Wednesday. \u201cThey\u2019ve rejected the ideology of extremism and share the values of freedom and tolerance.\u201d Are governors able to ban Syrian refugees? More than half of the US\u2019s governors have said they will not relocate refugees in their state, even though it is not within their power to do so. The US government has sole authority over whether immigrants and refugees of any nationality enter the US. Yet because of the way the government works with states to resettle refugees, there are actions states could take to disrupt the process. States can wield the power they do have to block funding from funneling through to programs that serve refugees, such as English language classes and job training programs designed to help them integrate into society. \u201cThere is some soft power being exerted by the states here even if there\u2019s not hard legal ground for the state to stand on,\u201d said Pratheepan Gulasekaram, an associate professor of law at Santa Clara University. \u201cIf this becomes a trend, I think it sets an extremely dangerous precedent.\u201d To distinguish which refugees will or will not be resettled based on their religion or national origin raises constitutional and legal problems, Gulasekaram said, adding: \u201cStates can\u2019t pick and choose amongst refugees.\u201d \u201cAccepting refugees into the United States is one of our grandest traditions. And we\u2019ve been doing it since the beginning even before we were a nation,\u201d said Lee Williams, vice-president and chief financial officer of US Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, one of the nine nine national agencies that handle refugee resettlement in the US. \u201cIt would be a real black mark on the United States\u2019s reputation were we to stop this process, though I hope we won\u2019t get to that point.\u201d This article was amended on 19 November 2015 to correct the percentage difference were the US to take in an additional 10,000 Syrians per year.",

Mais je ne suis ni surpris, ni incr\u00e9dule. Je connais l\u2019\u00c9tat islamique dont j\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019otage pendant dix mois et j\u2019ai une certitude : notre douleur, notre tristesse, nos espoirs, nos vies ne les touchent pas. Leur monde est \u00e0 part. La plupart des gens ne connaissent les djihadistes de l\u2019\u00c9tat islamique qu\u2019\u00e0 travers leurs documents de propagande. Moi, je les ai vus de l\u2019int\u00e9rieur. Lorsque j\u2019\u00e9tais en captivit\u00e9, j\u2019ai rencontr\u00e9 sans doute une dizaine de djihadistes, y compris Mohammed Emwazi. Jihadi John \u00e9tait l\u2019un de mes ge\u00f4liers. \u00ab Il m\u2019appelait Baldy \u00bb. Il m\u2019arrive encore maintenant de parler \u00e0 certains d\u2019entre eux sur les r\u00e9seaux sociaux, et je peux vous dire que l\u2019id\u00e9e que vous vous faites d\u2019eux est pour l\u2019essentiel le r\u00e9sultat d\u2019une campagne de marketing et de relations publiques. Ils se pr\u00e9sentent comme des super h\u00e9ros. Cependant, hors cam\u00e9ra, ils sont path\u00e9tiques \u00e0 bien des \u00e9gards. Ce sont des enfants des rues ivres d\u2019id\u00e9ologie et de pouvoir. En France, nous dirions qu\u2019ils sont \u2013 b\u00eates et m\u00e9chants. Ils sont sans doute plus b\u00eates que m\u00e9chants, m\u00eame s\u2019il ne faut pas minimiser le potentiel meurtrier de la b\u00eatise. Tous les otages d\u00e9capit\u00e9s l\u2019an dernier \u00e9taient mes compagnons de cellule. Nos ge\u00f4liers se jouaient de nous de mani\u00e8re pu\u00e9rile \u2013 torture psychologique. Un jour, ils disaient que nous serions lib\u00e9r\u00e9s, puis quinze jours apr\u00e8s, ils nous disaient d\u2019un air joyeux : \u00ab Demain, nous vous tuerons \u00bb . Les premi\u00e8res fois, nous les avons crus, mais peu \u00e0 peu, nous avons r\u00e9alis\u00e9 que la plupart d\u2019entre eux disaient n\u2019importe quoi, pour s\u2019amuser. Ils proc\u00e9daient \u00e0 des simulacres d\u2019ex\u00e9cution. Une fois, ils m\u2019ont chloroform\u00e9, une autre, ils ont mis en sc\u00e8ne une d\u00e9capitation. Un groupe de djihadistes francophones criaient : \u00ab On va vous couper la t\u00eate, vous la mettre sur le cul et sur YouTube \u00bb. Ils avaient un cimeterre antique. Ils riaient et j\u2019ai jou\u00e9 le jeu en hurlant, mais ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pour eux qu\u2019un amusement. \u00c0 peine partis, je me suis retourn\u00e9 vers un autre otage fran\u00e7ais et j\u2019ai ri. C\u2019\u00e9tait tellement ridicule. J\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9ellement impressionn\u00e9 par leur niveau de connexion technologique. Ils suivent l\u2019actualit\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re obsessive, mais tout passe au travers de leur propre prisme. Ils sont totalement endoctrin\u00e9s, s\u2019accrochent \u00e0 toutes sortes de th\u00e9ories du complot sans jamais en relever les contradictions. Ils sont convaincus d\u2019\u00eatre du bon c\u00f4t\u00e9. Pour eux, nous sommes dans un processus d\u2019apocalypse qui aboutira \u00e0 une confrontation entre les musulmans du monde entier et les autres, les crois\u00e9s, les Romains. Selon eux, tout va dans ce sens. Par cons\u00e9quent, tout est une b\u00e9n\u00e9diction d\u2019Allah. Ils vont suivre l\u2019actualit\u00e9 et les r\u00e9seaux sociaux, \u00e0 l\u2019aff\u00fbt des r\u00e9percussions que pourront avoir leurs attaques meurtri\u00e8res \u00e0 Paris. Je les imagine, en ce moment m\u00eame, scander : \u00ab Nous sommes en train de gagner \u00bb. Ils seront encourag\u00e9s par tous les signes de r\u00e9action excessive, de division, de peur, de racisme, de x\u00e9nophobie. Ils seront attentifs aux monstruosit\u00e9s qu\u2019ils pourront lire sur les m\u00e9dias sociaux. Au centre de leur vision du monde se trouve la croyance selon laquelle les autres communaut\u00e9s ne peuvent pas vivre en harmonie avec les musulmans.

Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said that in an effort to warn the truck drivers to leave the area in advance of Sunday\u2019s attacks, leaflets were dropped and coalition planes conducted low-level \u201cshow of force\u201d flights over the site.</p> <p>Davis said the coalition had determined that more needed to be done to inhibit the Islamic State\u2019s generation of oil revenues in Syria and Iraq. </p> <p>The Treasury Department said last year that the group earned nearly $1 million a day from illicit oil sales; the Pentagon believes that sum has risen to nearly $1.4 million a day. Since the earliest days of the U.S.-led bombing campaign, some parts of the Islamic State\u2019s oil infrastructure have been attacked, but the effort is now intensifying.</p> <p>\u201cThis part of it was designed to attack the distribution component of Isil\u2019s oil smuggling operation,\u201d Davis said, referring to attacking the fuel trucks. \u201cIsil is stealing oil from the people of Iraq and Syria to fund its campaign of terror.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-564a8360e4b0e0595dc6c450\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-11-17T01:44:39.083Z\">1.44am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Tragic details of the attacks continue to emerge, as the identities of more victims become public.

But, despite the power that such releases might have, they are nothing new, and we shouldn\u2019t mistake rhetoric for legitimate intelligence.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>Read her piece in full <a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/paris-attack-islamic-states-pledge-attack-washington-little-more-boast-1529036\">here</a>.</em></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-564a55a2e4b0e0595dc6c430\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-11-16T22:28:07.945Z\">10.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More pictures of the Tricolore in Paris ... </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/USEmbassyFrance/statuses/666361452878553088\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"fr\" dir=\"ltr\">Le Secr\u00e9taire d&#39;Etat <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JohnKerry\">@JohnKerry</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/USAmbFrance\">@USAmbFrance</a> illuminent <a href=\"https://twitter.com/USEmbassyFrance\">@USEmbassyFrance</a> aux couleurs de la France <a href=\"https://t.co/BNNqaUzotD\">pic.twitter.com/BNNqaUzotD</a></p>&mdash; U.S. Embassy France (@USEmbassyFrance) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/USEmbassyFrance/status/666361452878553088\">November 16, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>... and Brussels</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RymMomtaz/statuses/666377089621340161\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Brussels?src=hash\">#Brussels</a> City Hall lit up in Bleu Blanc Rouge, French flag colors tonight <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ParisAttacks?src=hash\">#ParisAttacks</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Molenbeek?src=hash\">#Molenbeek</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Belgium?src=hash\">#Belgium</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/France?src=hash\">#France</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/Qln2ShWarB\">pic.twitter.com/Qln2ShWarB</a></p>&mdash; Rym Momtaz (@RymMomtaz) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RymMomtaz/status/666377089621340161\">November 16, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-564a3d55e4b0e98c91b0d01c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-11-16T22:09:09.513Z\">10.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">UN hits back at worldwide calls to turn back refugees</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The UN has said that refusing refugees after the Paris attacks is not the \u201cway to go\u201d, amid calls to scale back plans to accept refugees by politicians from eastern Europe to North America.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"417a11edb7fe43cee66f281b917300b887ff37c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/417a11edb7fe43cee66f281b917300b887ff37c1/0_149_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"German police lead arriving migrants across a field to a transport facility after gathering them at the border to Austria on October 28, 2015 near Wegscheid, Germany.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">German police lead arriving migrants across a field to a transport facility after gathering them at the border to Austria on October 28, 2015 near Wegscheid, Germany.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johannes Simon/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>European countries, Canada and the United States are facing calls to deny entry to refugees after French investigators said one of the Paris attackers was a Syrian national who may have slipped into Europe as part of a wave of migrants.<br></p> <p><strong>In Canada</strong>, Prime Minister <a href=\"http://www.theghttp//www.theguardian.com/world/justin-trudeauhttp://www.theguardian.com/world/justin-trudeauuardian.com/world/justin-trudeau\">Justin Trudeau</a> has faced calls to delay bringing in 25,000 Syrian refugees by the end of the year due to security concerns prompted by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/paris-attacks\">Paris terror attacks</a>.

He nicknamed me \u201cBaldy\u201d.</p> <p>Even now I sometimes chat with them on social media, and can tell you that much of what you think of them results from their brand of marketing and public relations. They present themselves to the public as superheroes, but away from the camera are a bit pathetic in many ways: street kids drunk on ideology and power. In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/france\">France</a> we have a saying \u2013 stupid and evil. I found them more stupid than evil. That is not to understate the murderous potential of stupidity.</p> <p>[...] Why France?

But everything I know tells me this is a mistake. The bombardment will be huge, a symbol of righteous anger. Within 48 hours of the atrocity, fighter planes conducted their most spectacular munitions raid yet in Syria, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/16/raqqa-activists-french-airstrikes-syria-isis-paris-attacks\">dropping more than 20 bombs on Raqqa</a>, an Isis stronghold. Revenge was perhaps inevitable, but what\u2019s needed is deliberation. My fear is that this reaction will make a bad situation worse.</p> <p>While we are trying to destroy Isis, what of the 500,000 civilians still living and trapped in Raqqa? What of their safety? What of the very real prospect that by failing to think this through, we turn many of them into extremists? The priority must be to protect these people, not to take more bombs to<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/syria\">Syria</a>. We need no-fly zones \u2013 zones closed to Russians, the regime, the coalition.

In particular, CloudFlare appears to be providing its security services to the militants\u2019 media centre, al-Furqan.

On the other hand, a tempting conversational gambit like \u201chow was your day?\u201d may not reveal the whole truth. In my experience, that moment before lights out is the moment when some really searing observation can upset your equilibrium as well as theirs.</p> <p>At that point you have to stop and listen. Try to get them to explain what they know, and why it\u2019s scary. Acknowledge that it is reasonable to be scared and horrified. Only after, with your help and encouragement, they have talked through all their anxieties do you come back with the message you may have been bursting to hit them with from the beginning, the one about probability and risk. After all, you are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/shortcuts/2015/jun/03/why-fishing-more-dangerous-than-riding-rollercoaster-alton-towers\">much more likely to be run over by a car</a> than to be the victim of a terror attack.</p> <p>Even the irrational horror of a school shooting can touch on the need for compassion and empathy. Paris, with all its tricky questions about terrorism, religion and the slaughter of people not much older than them, is in a way easier to talk about as well as more difficult.

          "bodyText": "This live blog will be ending shortly, but coverage will continue with my London colleague, Jessica Elgot. New round of airstrikes against Isis The French military dropped 16 bombs on Isis targets in the stronghold of Raqqa, hitting a command centre and a training centre, the country\u2019s defence ministry said. US strikes earlier hit 116 oil trucks in Eastern Syria, the first attack of its kind since US-led forces began targeting Isis in Syria. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said he would back parts of the Syrian opposition with air support in a joint fight against Islamic State in northern Syria. Belgium - Spain friendly football match cancelled Citing security concerns for players and fans, the Belgian football association announced Tuesday\u2019s friendly match, scheduled to be played in Brussels, had been cancelled. The France - England match at Wembley stadium is going ahead, with vastly increased security. UN, Obama hit back at worldwide calls to turn back refugees The UN has said that refusing refugees after the Paris attacks is not the \u201cway to go\u201d, as politicians in US, Canada and eastern Europe call to scale back plans to accept refugees. About 25 US state governors have resisted or refused to take Syrian refugees, but their legal right to do so has been called into question. Anonymous has vowed retaliatory cyber-attacks against Isis Fran\u00e7ois Hollande calls for change to French constitution The French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, said France would intensify strikes against Islamic State in the coming days, as France \u201cwas at war\u201d with Isis France demands a rapid implementation of \u201ccoordinated and systematic controls\u201d of the EU\u2019s internal and external borders, he said. Hollande said he wanted French law to allow dual nationals to be stripped of their French citizenship if they were convicted of terrorism and called for the French constitution to be rewritten. Obama rules out boots on the ground The US president, Barack Obama, has said he will defy critics who have called for him to send in ground troops to defeat Isis, saying it would go against the advice of his military strategists. Isis has released what appears to be a new propaganda video, warning of an attack in Washington DC John Kerry will meet with French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande tomorrow. Arrests made and suspects tracked across Europe Serbian authorities have arrested a man with a Syrian passport matching one found near the body of a Paris attacker. French forces raided the north-eastern city of Strasbourg, after witnesses claimed to have seen fugitive suspect Salah Abdeslam.The raid did not yield Abdeslam. A French official has identified the alleged mastermind of the Paris attacks as Belgian-born Abdelhamid Abu Oud. Two of the seven people detained in Belgium on Saturday are being held on terrorism charges, Belgian federal prosecutors have said. Five have been released, including the brother of two of the suspected attackers. After being released by Belgian police along with five others, Mohamed Abdeslam, said his family is unaware of his brother (fugitive suspect) Salah\u2019s whereabouts. German authorities have arrested an Algerian asylum seeker, who they allege told associates early last week that bomb attacks were coming to Paris. French police name more attackers Paris prosecutors have identified two more suicide bombers from Friday\u2019s attacks as Ahmad Almohammad and Samy Amimour, a French national. Syrian passport holder Almohammad, who is said to have blown himself up at the Stade de France, reportedly passed with refugees through the Greek island of Leros. A Turkish official has told the Guardian that Turkey twice informed French authorities about the suicide bomber Omar Isma\u00efl Mostefai, but only received an information request about him from France after the Paris attacks. French police continue to hunt for Salah Abdeslam, believed to beone of three brothers involved in Friday night\u2019s attack, who is on the run. A major Belgian raid on a street in Molenbeek, in the Brussels suburbs, did not locate him. Echoing a call to arms from French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, on Monday night, Ash Carter, the US defence secretary, said America was continuing to look for opportunities to strike at the terrorists but needs its European allies to make bolder moves to defeat the group militarily. In his first public comments since 129 were killed in the coordinated assault on the French capital, Carter said the attacks had \u201cgalvanised\u201d France into taking bolder action against Isis and cooperating further with the US and that he hoped it would have the same effect on other European partners. \u201cWe\u2019re looking to do more, we\u2019re looking for every opportunity we can to get in there and go at [Isis], but we need others to ... get in the game as well,\u201d Carter said. \u201cI\u2019m hoping that this tragedy has the effect of galvanising others as it has galvanised the French,\u201d Carter said, speaking at a forum in Washington. Read the article in full here. I posted earlier that around 25 US governors were now refusing or resisting Syrian refugees being resettled in their states, with some calling for a reevaluation of security and screening processes. Others have gone further in their reasoning. New Jersey governor Chris Christie said no Syrian refugees should be allowed into the US - even orphaned babies and toddlers. \u201cI don\u2019t think orphans under 5... should be admitted into the United States at this point. But you know, they have no family here. How are we going to care for these folks?\u201d Christie said in an interview. \u201cBut in the end, I don\u2019t trust this administration to effectively vet the people that they\u2019re asking us to take in.\u201d Governor of Minnesota, Mark Dayton hasn\u2019t objected to Syrian refugees in his state as long as they undergo rigorous screening, but presidential hopeful Mike Huckabee disagrees. Huckabee has told Fox News radio Syrians shouldn\u2019t be brought to Minnesota because it\u2019s cold. \u201cCan you imagine bringing in a bunch of Syrian refugees who\u2019ve lived in the desert their whole lives that are suddenly thrown into an English speaking community? WHere it\u2019s maybe in Minnesota where it is 20 degrees below zero? I mean I just don\u2019t understand what we possibly can be thinking.\u201d Huckabee\u2019s concern for the warmth of refugees followed comments he made in another Fox interview, that \u201cit\u2019s time to wake up and smell the felafel\u201d and that the US is \u201cimporting terrorism.\u201d Butch Otter, governor of Idaho, said it made no sense to allow people \u201cwho have the avowed desire to harm our communities, our institutions and our people\u201d into his community. Massachusetts governor Charlie Baker said he was \u201cnot interested in accepting refugees from Syria.\u201d We have more details of the French military airstrikes against Isis. The French defence ministry has confirmed the raid, which occurred shortly after midnight GMT, according to AFP. A total of 16 bombs were dropped from 10 Rafale and Mirage 2000 fighters, destroying a command centre and a training centre in Raqqa. \u201cConducted in coordination with US forces, the raid was aimed at sites identified during reconnaissance missions previously carried out by France,\u201d a statement from the ministry said. AFP are reporting France has launched a new round of air raids against Isis in Raqqa \u2013 a stronghold of the group. It follows Sunday\u2019s raids in which a dozen Isis targets \u2013 including a command centre, recruitment centre for jihadis, a munitions depot, and a training camp for fighters \u2013 were bombed by fighter jets launched from the United Arab Emirates and Jordan. French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande on Monday vowed to intensify airstrikes against Isis. The Philippines is on high alert as world leaders, including US president Barack Obama, Chinese president Xi Jinping and Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe, arrived in Manila for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit. While Philippines officials have said there is no intelligence suggesting an attack on the two-day summit, about 30,000 police and soldiers have been deployed, military aircraft is on standby, and a number of navy vessels are moored in Manila Bay, Reuters reports. The impending summit has been clouded by the attacks, and the just-finished G20 talks in Turkey were dominated by discussions of violence emanating from Syria\u2019s civil war, the report said. Scottish paper, the National, not following US governors\u2019 lead, then. Security is extremely tight ahead of Tuesday night\u2019s football match between England and France at Wembley stadium. More than 80,000 people are expected to show up to watch the game in a show of defiance following the Paris attacks, and authorities have stepped up their presence. Armed police officers manned the tunnel and stands during the French team\u2019s traning session on Monday. Players will wear black armbands in memory of the victims, the Guardian\u2019s Dominic Fifield reported earlier. Rooney and the France captain, Hugo Lloris, together with the referee, will lay a floral tribute on the pitch before the kick-off. The words to La Marseillaise are to be emblazoned across the screens in the stadium in the hope the whole arena sings the French national anthem, which will be sung after God Save The Queen. \u201cI believe that tomorrow night it\u2019s going to be more about us showing solidarity rather than what necessarily happens on the field,\u201d England coach Roy Hodgson said on Monday. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said on Monday he would back parts of the Syrian opposition with air support in a joint fight against Islamic State in northern Syria, in the first concrete sign that Russia and the west can set aside their differences over the political future of President Bashar al-Assad in order to defeat Isis. Hinting at the Russian change of policy, David Cameron said there were \u201csome signs\u201d during talks with Putin on the margins of the G20 summit that Russia would no longer focus bombing raids on moderate Syrian forces. Putin\u2019s offer, if it turns into reality, is potentially the biggest military breakthrough in Syria for some months, and allied with the pressure being applied to Isis in Iraq, could start to change the military equation in Syria.

Following the Paris attacks, a number of US governors are threatening to attempt to block the acceptance of Syrian refugees into their states, reports the AP, however the legality of such action has been called into question. Among the state governors who have made their positions clear, leaders from Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Wisconsin have all either refused to take Syrian refugees, called for an end to the national resettlement program, or called for a postponement while screening and security processes are re-evaluated. New Jersey\u2019s Chris Christie said he was opposed to any Syrian refugees - even infant orphans - entering the country, and South Carolina\u2019s Nikki Haley said she supported allowing refugees into her state as long as they\u2019re not from Syria. Vermont\u2019s governor, Peter Shumlin accused governors threatening to refuse refugees were \u201cstomping on the qualities that make America great. The governor of Washington, Jay Inslee, also criticised them. California, Connecticut, Delaware, Rhode Island and Hawaii were among the states which said they would continue to accept Syrian refugees. This report from the Guardian\u2019s Milan Dinic in London and Amanda Holpuch in New York: Serbian police have arrested a man carrying a Syrian passport with the same details as one found near the body of one of the Paris suicide bombers, police sources have told the Guardian. The passport bears the same name and details \u2013 but a different photograph \u2013 as the document found near one of the men who attacked the Stade de France. Serbian officials said that they believe both passports are fake, but added that they are working with French investigators to establish the origin of the documents. Read the full report from Dinic and Holpuch here. The US secretary of defense says the most immediate Isis threat to the US is of a \u201clone wolf\u201d style attack, Reuters is reporting. In his first public appearance since the Paris attacks, secretary Ash Carter said the US would continue to look for opportunities to strike Isis. In a Wall Street Journal forum, Carter said it included hitting oil infrastructure, and aiding ground forces. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for opportunities to get at them, and we\u2019ll continue to do that until they\u2019re defeated,\u201d said Carter. Congress will on Tuesday (for the House) and Wednesday (for the Senate) receive classified briefings from the FBI and Homeland Security on the Paris attacks. In an attack which was the first of its kind since US-led forces began airstrikes in Syria, US warplanes have destroyed 116 oil-hauling trucks in eastern Syria that were a key part of a smuggling operation that brings the group an estimated $1.4 million a day, the AP reports. The trucks were clustered near Abu Kamal, a town close to the Iraqi border. US officials previously had said they avoided attacking fuel trucks out of concern for civilian casualties. Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said that in an effort to warn the truck drivers to leave the area in advance of Sunday\u2019s attacks, leaflets were dropped and coalition planes conducted low-level \u201cshow of force\u201d flights over the site. Davis said the coalition had determined that more needed to be done to inhibit the Islamic State\u2019s generation of oil revenues in Syria and Iraq. The Treasury Department said last year that the group earned nearly $1 million a day from illicit oil sales; the Pentagon believes that sum has risen to nearly $1.4 million a day. Since the earliest days of the U.S.-led bombing campaign, some parts of the Islamic State\u2019s oil infrastructure have been attacked, but the effort is now intensifying. \u201cThis part of it was designed to attack the distribution component of Isil\u2019s oil smuggling operation,\u201d Davis said, referring to attacking the fuel trucks. \u201cIsil is stealing oil from the people of Iraq and Syria to fund its campaign of terror.\u201d Tragic details of the attacks continue to emerge, as the identities of more victims become public. The Daily Mail has spoken with the brothers of two women killed at La Belle Equipe where 19 people died - 11 from a party celebrating the birthday of one of the sisters, Tunisian waitress Houda Saadi. Five of the party, including Saadi, were staff members from the nearby Cafe des Ange, it said. \u201cThey killed everybody, My two sisters, my friends and my sister\u2019s friends that were there,\u201d said Saadi\u2019s brother, Khaled, who was inside the restaurant when the shooting began. \u201cIt lasted a minute in total, but it was very long. I then went out of the restaurant and they were all dead or suffering.\u201d Halima Saadi, 36-years-old and a mother of two, died on the spot. Houda was also shot and died in hospital of her injuries. The shield of a member of the BRI - a French police force special unit - after the assault on Bataclan. UN humanitarian chief Stephen O\u2019Brien has urged members of the Security Council not to squander momentum to end the Syrian conflict, AP reports. O\u2019Brien pointed to the 13.5m people in need of aid, the more than 4m Syrians seeking refuge, and the continuing indiscriminate use of weapons. He said some 400,000 Syrians have made the perilous journey across the Mediterranean this year representing over 50% of those heading to Europe by sea and without a political settlement, more will follow every day even as winter approaches. He urged world leaders to seize the momentum from this weekend\u2019s international talks in Vienna to put an end to \u201cthis horrendous war\u201d that has cost an estimated 250,000 lives, given rise to extremist and terrorist groups, and reduced much of what was once a middle-income country \u201cto rubble.\u201d O\u2019Brien addressed the council hours after the United Nations and the leaders of Britain, Germany, Norway and Kuwait issued a joint announcement saying they will host a conference in London in February to step up funding for the Syrian humanitarian crisis. Katie Healy, the girlfriend of Irishman David Nolan, who was shot and injured at the Eagles of Death Metal concert, has told RT\u00c9 News of their ordeal at the Bataclan. I felt a splash on my shoulder while I was watching the concert and I turned to David thinking it was someone spilling a drink. We then heard gunfire and [saw] sparks and flashing. We realised what was happening and the crowd fell to the side. Everybody got up to run and gunshots started again, so we lay on the ground among the bodies of everyone who stood with us and just played dead. We\u2019re not sure exactly at what point David was shot. He threw himself on top of me twice - both times when we fell - and covered me making sure my head and chest was covered as best as he could. It became quiet and you could hear everybody moaning, and single shots started to fire and we realised the gunmen were walking around killing everyone laying there with us. We saw the foot of a gunman who walked past us, and we said out goodbyes and as we realised what was about to happen to us, someone opened a door somewhere and we just ran.\u201d You can listen to Healy\u2019s account in full in the embedded video below. A friendly international football match between Belgium and Spain has been cancelled due to the attacks. The already sold-out game was scheduled for Tuesday in Brussels, but the Belgian Football Association has said the security risk to players and fans was too great. \u201cWe regret very much that such a friendly match between two highly motivated teams must be canceled so late and understand that many fans will be disappointed,\u201d said a statement on the Belgian FA website. \u201cHowever in these exceptional circumstances, we can not take risks with the safety of our players and supporters.\u201d A match between France and England is still set to go ahead at Wembley on Tuesday night. Here is what we know so far: UN hits back at worldwide calls to turn back refugees The UN has said that refusing refugees after the Paris attacks is not the \u201cway to go\u201d, as politicians in US, Canada and eastern Europe call to scale back plans to accept refugees. Anonymous has vowed retaliatory cyber-attacks against Isis Fran\u00e7ois Hollande calls for change to French constitution The French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, said France would intensify strikes against Islamic State in the coming days, as France \u201cwas at war\u201d with Isis France demands a rapid implementation of \u201ccoordinated and systematic controls\u201d of the EU\u2019s internal and external borders, he said. Hollande said he wanted French law to allow dual nationals to be stripped of their French citizenship if they were convicted of terrorism and called for the French constitution to be rewritten. Obama rules out boots on the ground The US president, Barack Obama, has said he will defy critics who have called for him to send in ground troops to defeat Isis, saying it would go against the advice of his military strategists. Isis has released what appears to be a new propaganda video, warning of an attack in Washington DC John Kerry will meet with French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande tomorrow. Arrests made and suspects tracked across Europe French forces raided the north-eastern city of Strasbourg, after witnesses claimed to have seen fugitive suspect Salah Abdeslam. The raid did not yield Abdeslam. A French official has identified the alleged mastermind of the Paris attacks as Belgian-born Abdelhamid Abu Oud. Two of the seven people detained in Belgium on Saturday are being held on terrorism charges, Belgian federal prosecutors have said. Five have been released, including the brother of two of the suspected attackers. After being released by Belgian police along with five others, Mohamed Abdeslam, said his family is unaware of his brother (fugitive suspect) Salah\u2019s whereabouts. German authorities have arrested an Algerian asylum seeker, who they allege told associates early last week that bomb attacks were coming to Paris. French police name more attackers Paris prosecutors have identified two more suicide bombers from Friday\u2019s attacks as Ahmad Almohammad and Samy Amimour, a French national. Syrian passport holder Almohammad, who is said to have blown himself up at the Stade de France, reportedly passed with refugees through the Greek island of Leros. A Turkish official has told the Guardian that Turkey twice informed French authorities about the suicide bomber Omar Isma\u00efl Mostefai, but only received an information request about him from France after the Paris attacks. French police continue to hunt for Salah Abdeslam, believed to beone of three brothers involved in Friday night\u2019s attack, who is on the run. A major Belgian raid on a street in Molenbeek, in the Brussels suburbs, did not locate him. That\u2019s it from me in New York. Helen Davidson will be taking over the live blog from Sydney. Two weeks ago, the mayor of Molenbeek ordered the closure of a neighbourhood bar where Brussels police had found young men dealing drugs and smoking dope over the summer, Reuters reports. Brahim Abdeslam\u2019s journey from barkeeper to suicide bomber remains a mystery, along with the whereabouts of his younger brother Salah, now on the run as Europe\u2019s most wanted man but until recently the manager of Brahim\u2019s bar, Les Beguines. The brothers sold the business just six weeks ago. There is a seeming disconnect between the ownership by Muslims \u2013 whose religion forbids the use of alcohol and tobacco\u2013 of a bar, where drugs were being dealt, on a quiet street in the low-rent Brussels borough of Molenbeek who have become the focus of a manhunt for violent Islamists with ties to Syria. Yet time and again, investigations after attacks like those that killed 129 people in Paris have uncovered tales of workaday Arab immigrant lives, assimilated to the profane daily cares and pleasures of European cities, that have turned, unseen to family and friends, into explosions of pious, suicidal fanaticism. More on the attackers here. Twitter account @EnM\u00e9moire (In memory) has been posting the names, ages, nationalities and photos of the victims of Friday\u2019s attacks, with short tributes to them: We have been documenting what we know about the victims here: How Jean Jullien\u2019s simple doodle spread around the world The first thing Jean Jullien did when he heard about the Paris attacks was reach for paper and his paintbrush, and sketch a simple image on his lap. Late on Friday evening, he posted it on to his Instagram and Twitter pages: a quick doodle of the Eiffel tower inside a circle, in an adaption of the peace symbol originally used by the nuclear disarmament movement. Jullien is a graphic designer originally from Nantes but based in London. It wasn\u2019t particularly an illustrator\u2019s response, he said, \u201cmore an instinctive, human reaction\u201d. But the simplicity of his design, rendered in just a few brush strokes, did not diminish its power. In the days since the atrocities, his arresting image, captioned \u201cPeace for Paris\u201d, has been shared many thousands of times on social media worldwide, becoming a global expression of solidarity, resistance and hope for peace. In the US, privacy advocates reacted with outrage after NYPD commissioner Bill Bratton and CIA director John Brennan separately declared that the attacks in Paris ought to encourage tech companies to create \u201cback doors\u201d into encryption. Brennan cited \u201ctechnological capabilities\u201d that made it difficult \u201cfor intelligence services to have the insight they need\u201d and said he hoped the events in Paris would be \u201ca wake-up call\u201d. Bratton told MSNBC host and former Republican congressman Joe Scarborough that \u201cYou have to be on the offense. Offense is intelligence\u201d on MSNBC, and said that encryption was a problem. \u201cWe are losing a lot of that intelligence momentum because of that issue.\u201d Privacy advocate Lauren Weinstein, who worked on the Department of Defense\u2019s proto-internet project Arpanet, said secure encryption backdoors are a pure impossibility. \u201cIf there was a scientifically provable way to do this, we could have the discussion,\u201d Weinstein told the Guardian, \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t make sense to have the discussion when everybody who\u2019s looked at this and is honest about it says that it would make us more vulnerable. \u201cThe math will get you every time.\u201d \u201cAt this point there is no confirmation that end-to-end encryption was used by the attackers, much less that the use of that encryption is what led the world\u2019s intelligence services to fail to detect the plot before the tragedy,\u201d wrote Electronic Frontier Foundation executive director Cindy Cohn. \u201cAny \u2018backdoor\u2019 into our communications will inevitably (and perhaps primarily) be used for illegal and repressive purposes rather than lawful ones,\u201d said Cohn. Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s historic Versailles speech \u2013 in which he hammered home that France was \u201cat war\u201d and promised to \u201ceradicate terrorism\u201d \u2013 was the most martial performance he has ever given. It marked the completion of an intriguing transformation that has taken place over several years: of the socialist who was once derided as a soft, conflict-avoidant, blancmange-like \u201cmarshmallow\u201d into a self-styled \u201cchief of war\u201d. Hollande\u2019s blistering war-talk, security clampdown, and vow to destroy Islamic State across the world marks a sharp turnaround for the French left and will inevitably be compared to George W Bush\u2019s political rhetoric after America\u2019s September 11 attacks. But the Bush comparison does not stand up entirely \u2013 the French context of homegrown terrorism makes matters far more complex and nuanced. \u201cWe\u2019re not in a war of civilisation because these killers don\u2019t represent one,\u201d said Hollande. \u201cWe\u2019re at war against jihadi terrorism.\u201d Yet it is clear that the coordinated Paris terrorist attacks that left 129 dead and 352 injured in the worst assault on French soil since the second world war have changed the direction of Hollande\u2019s politics. This was the speech of a leader fighting for his own political survival. The least popular French president in modern history, Hollande had very few arms at his disposal, having already pulled out all the stops after January\u2019s attackson the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo and a Paris kosher grocery store. In the wake of those attacks, he had already introduced a raft of draconian surveillance powers, put thousands of soldiers on the streets of France, hardened laws on hate-speech, cracked down on \u201cspeech that glorified terrorism\u201d and launched airstrikes on Isis targets in Syria. And yet, still France was hit once again. After earlier reports that Isis had threatened an attack on Washington, right-wing terrorism analyst Rita Katz has \u2013 surprisingly \u2013 called for calm: Such rallying threats are routine in ISIS releases after it pulls off attacks (and even when it doesn\u2019t). IS releases, as well as chatter from its fighters, have long called for lone wolf operations inside of America, claiming that they will eventually place the group\u2019s black flag atop of the White House. [...]Given the magnitude of the Paris attacks, I\u2019m sure there are plenty of similar releases yet to come from the group. There is no doubt a strong link between words and actions when it comes to IS, and these threats that must be taken seriously. But, despite the power that such releases might have, they are nothing new, and we shouldn\u2019t mistake rhetoric for legitimate intelligence. Read her piece in full here. More pictures of the Tricolore in Paris ... ... and Brussels The UN has said that refusing refugees after the Paris attacks is not the \u201cway to go\u201d, amid calls to scale back plans to accept refugees by politicians from eastern Europe to North America. European countries, Canada and the United States are facing calls to deny entry to refugees after French investigators said one of the Paris attackers was a Syrian national who may have slipped into Europe as part of a wave of migrants. In Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has faced calls to delay bringing in 25,000 Syrian refugees by the end of the year due to security concerns prompted by the Paris terror attacks. While an online petition against fast-tracking Syrian asylum seekers\u2019 bids to relocate to Canada gained steam, the premier of Saskatchewan province, Brad Wall, urged the prime minister to \u201csuspend\u201d the move. Read more on Canada\u2019s response to Paris attacks here. Meanwhile, in the US, a growing list of governors and lawmakers are moving to block US acceptance of Syrian refugees, inciting outrage from the Muslim and immigrant communities who say it is Muslims who have suffered the most from Isis attacks, write my colleagues Ryan Felton, Tom Dart and Matthew Teague: At least 15 states have expressed resistance to accepting Syrian refugees attempting to flee their country\u2019s civil war, and the list is rapidly expanding. Several governors are working to prevent refugee resettlement in their state directly, while other governors and several members of Congress are urging federal action. Michigan governor Rick Snyder was among the first to initiate the resistance campaign, suspending his state\u2019s Syrian refugee resettlement program. The move was an about-face for the governor, who had held out his state as a haven for resettling refugees, particularly those from Syria. Read the piece in full here. In Hungary, Prime Minister Viktor Orban said, \u201cIn a deliberate and organised way, terrorists have exploited mass migration by mingling in the mass of people leaving their homes in the hope of a better life\u201d. His right-wing government has taken a hard line against migrants, sealing the country\u2019s southern borders with razor-wire fence and repeatedly claiming that the influx of mostly Muslim refugees threatened the continent\u2019s Christian identity. Orban slammed the European Union for being \u201cadrift, weak and incompetent\u201d, saying top officials should have done more to prevent the attacks in the French capital. In Poland, the new right-wing, eurosceptic government was sworn signalling it would take a hard line on Europe\u2019s biggest migrant crisis since World War II - even floating the idea of sending Syrians back to \u201cliberate\u201d their country. A French Muslim students association, \u00c9tudiants Musulmans de France, released a video on Sunday condemning the deadly Paris attacks, and expressing solidarity with those affected by the violence. The video has been making the rounds on social media using the hashtag, #NousSommesUnis (We Are United, in English), and has been viewed more than 200,000 times. The words spoken in the video are available in the comments under the video on Youtube in French, here\u2019s a rough translation in English: One for all and all for Humanity Nearly 120 dead. One Hundred wounded. 3 days of mourning because of 8 suspected terrorists. France is plunged into chaos and fright. And me, I remain speechless. They think they can lead a war against the Crusaders And invoke the Qu\u2019ran while relying on its verses But shedding the blood of an innocent does not correspond to any laws If they don\u2019t understand that, I don\u2019t understand them. Will my heart be left enough time to scar? Between Charlie Hebdo, the Thalys and Paris submerged \u2018My France hurts\u2019, my heart cries out As my faith follows my heart. My faith, whose foundations have been shaken By 120 dead and millions of broken hearts By the acts of the terrorists, who were convinced of their choice But true faith will always condemns these attacks. They wanted to weaken France. They reinforced the hearts of the French One cry will be loudest: that of fraternity One for all and all for humanity We are and will always stay united, forevermore. \u201cI was held hostage by Isis. They fear our unity more than our airstrikes\u201d, writes Nicholas Henin, a French journalist who was held captive by Isis for 10 months: As a proud Frenchman I am as distressed as anyone about the events in Paris. But I am not shocked or incredulous. I know Islamic State. I spent 10 months as an Isis hostage, and I know for sure that our pain, our grief, our hopes, our lives do not touch them. Theirs is a world apart. Most people only know them from their propaganda material, but I have seen behind that. In my time as their captive, I met perhaps a dozen of them, includingMohammed Emwazi: Jihadi John was one of my jailers. He nicknamed me \u201cBaldy\u201d. Even now I sometimes chat with them on social media, and can tell you that much of what you think of them results from their brand of marketing and public relations. They present themselves to the public as superheroes, but away from the camera are a bit pathetic in many ways: street kids drunk on ideology and power. In France we have a saying \u2013 stupid and evil. I found them more stupid than evil. That is not to understate the murderous potential of stupidity. [...] Why France? For many reasons perhaps, but I think they identified my country as a weak link in Europe \u2013 as a place where divisions could be sown easily. That\u2019s why, when I am asked how we should respond, I say that we must act responsibly. And yet more bombs will be our response. I am no apologist for Isis. How could I be? But everything I know tells me this is a mistake. The bombardment will be huge, a symbol of righteous anger. Within 48 hours of the atrocity, fighter planes conducted their most spectacular munitions raid yet in Syria, dropping more than 20 bombs on Raqqa, an Isis stronghold. Revenge was perhaps inevitable, but what\u2019s needed is deliberation. My fear is that this reaction will make a bad situation worse. While we are trying to destroy Isis, what of the 500,000 civilians still living and trapped in Raqqa? What of their safety? What of the very real prospect that by failing to think this through, we turn many of them into extremists? The priority must be to protect these people, not to take more bombs toSyria. We need no-fly zones \u2013 zones closed to Russians, the regime, the coalition. The Syrian people need security or they themselves will turn to groups such as Isis. Read more about Henin\u2019s experiences in his piece below: Citing a government source, AFP has said that French nationals returning from Syria may be put under house arrest: French police have just conducted a raid in the Neudorf neighbourhood of Strasbourg in northeastern France, where witnesses were thought to have spotted Salah Abdeslam, the fugitive suspect. The residents of the building were confined to the gymnasium, but Abdeslam wasn't found, according to local radio France Bleu Alsace. Le Figaro is reporting that French police have found an apartment has been found in Bobigny, a northern suburb of Paris which was also the site of pre-dawn raids on Monday morning. According to our information, after having searched the GPS on the Seat Leon, investigators located an apartment in Bobigny which was rented, according to the landlord, to Brahim Abdeslam, one of the named perpetrators of Friday night\u2019s attacks. He had been using it for a week prior to the attacks. The police found mobile phones and sim cards, indicating this could be the location where the attackers came together before launching the attacks on Friday. (Original in French here). With every new piece of information that has come to light about the perpetrators of the Paris attacks, it has become clearer that the intelligence services in France and Belgium knew about their jihadi backgrounds. Several had dossiers identifying them as radicals. At least five had travelled to fight in Syria and returned to homes in France or Belgium. They were dots on the radar screen but the security services failed to join them up and so overlooked the gathering conspiracy. \u201cWhat we know is that most of these people came back from Syria and nobody stopped them,\u201d said Natalie Goulet, a member of the French senate foreign and defence committee. \u201cWhatever the reform that has been implemented [in the intelligence agencies] it\u2019s not working.\u201d In Belgium, the parliamentary committee with oversight of the country\u2019s intelligence services has opened an inquiry into the failings in the run-up to the attacks. A Green MP, Stefaan Van Hecke said: \u201cIt appears that the terrorists managed to evade the intelligence radar and the police. The question is to know what more we can do now.\u201d Abdel-Hamid Abu Oud, who French authorities said on Monday was the mastermind behind the attack, had been identified as an accomplice of two jihadis who were killed in a shootout at a house in the eastern Belgian town of Verviers in January. By his own account, they had travelled back from Syria with him the previous year and set up a safe house there. Read Julian\u2019s piece in full here. US secretary of state John Kerry arrived in Paris on Monday to pay respects to the victims of the Paris terror attacks, and to highlight Washington\u2019s support for a key ally in the way against Isis. Saying the United States and France were \u201cnot only friends, we are family,\u201d Kerry vowed to keep up the fight against Islamic State. Kerry said the conflict against the Islamic State militants is not a clash of civilizations. \u201cThey are in fact psychopathic monsters. There\u2019s nothing civilized about them,\u201d Kerry said. State Department spokesman John Kirby said Kerry will meet and thank U.S. Embassy staffers and hold talks with French officials. Kerry landed in the French capital under unusual security precautions that precluded journalists accompanying with him from reporting his planned visit \u2013 believed to be the first such restriction for a secretary of state\u2019s travel to a European capital. The UN security council observed a minute of silence for victims of the Paris attacks: One stateless group has declared war on another: Anonymous has said it will launch cyber-attacks on Isis. \u201cExpect us,\u201d said a figure wearing a Guy Fawkes mask in a French-language video uploaded to YouTube on Monday. Through its many social media arms, the hackers\u2019 collective has claimed to be \u201cbetter hackers\u201d than Isis, and accused companies including San Francisco-based CloudFlare of providing technical assistance to Islamic State. In particular, CloudFlare appears to be providing its security services to the militants\u2019 media centre, al-Furqan. On Monday, a pop-up appeared on an al-Furqan site saying that it was \u201ccurrently offline\u201d. \u201cHowever, because the site uses CloudFlare\u2019s Always Online\u2122 technology you can continue to surf a snapshot of the site.\u201d Security analyst Evan Kohlmann accused CloudFlare of supporting Isis in January before a congressional subcommittee held in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo attacks. \u201c[H]ow does Isis manage to reliably operate its own official proprietary dot-com social media platform on the internet in order to disseminate videos such as the beheading of James Foley and the \u2018martyrdom\u2019 will of Amedy Coulibaly?\u201d Kohlmann asked rhetorically. \u201cThe answer is another San Francisco-based American tech security company called CloudFlare, which aims to shield internet websites and resources from being targeted by spammers, cybercriminals, and frustrating denial-of-service attacks.\u201d Kohlmann also listed social messaging applications from Twitter and Facebook to Skype, many of which have terms of service that prohibit incitement to violence and take steps to shut down accounts disseminating it. CloudFlare, asked by online publication The Kernel about its policies, posted a long response in 2013 by CEO Matthew Prince in which he said his service wasn\u2019t responsible for its users. \u201cA website is speech. It is not a bomb,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThere is no imminent danger it creates and no provider has an affirmative obligation to monitor and make determinations about the theoretically harmful nature of speech a site may contain.\u201d A spokesperson for CloudFlare did not immediately respond to requests for comment. This is the second \u201cattack\u201d by Anonymous on a militant organisation this month: earlier in November the group published a list of names it alleged to be members of the Ku Klux Klan. The alleged mastermind of the Paris attacks, Abdel-Hamid Abu Oud, was born to a Moroccan immigrant family 28 years ago in Brussels, write my colleagues Ian Black and Josh Halliday. His real name was not widely known until it was publicised by French officials on Monday allegedhe was the mastermind of Friday\u2019s attacks in Paris. [...] In an interview this year Abu Oud spoke confidently of the battle to \u201cterrorise the crusaders waging war against the Muslims\u201d. For a man at the centre of global manhunt, he was already something of a celebrity. On social media he is referred to by his nom de guerre, Abu Umar al-Belgiki \u2013 combining a resonant Sunni Muslim first name with his country of origin. Confusingly, he also called himself Abu Omar Soussi, suggesting a Tunisian connection. Abu Oud reportedly joined Isis in 2013 along with hundreds of other young Belgian Muslims seeking to fight the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad. He returned home, via Greece, at the end of that year. In March 2014 he appeared in a video in a pickup truck dragging four mutilated corpses behind it to a mass grave. Read the profile of Abu Oud here: Watch a video about the alleged attackers here: The only Irish national shot and wounded in the Bataclan Theatre has been named as 32-year-old David Nolan from Cork City. He has had surgery for a gunshot wound to his leg but is now described as being in a stable condition. Nolan and his girlfriend were attending the Eagles of Death Metal concert on Friday night. Ireland\u2019s Foreign Minister Charles Flanagan confirmed the only Irish victim of the shooting and suicide bomb attacks at the gig was in a stable condition in hospital. Flanagan said officials from the Irish Embassy in Paris and his department in Dublin were in close contact with the man and his family. The Minister added: \u201cI also appeal for full respect be shown at all times for the privacy of the injured Irish citizen and their family following what has been a hugely traumatic experience.\u201d Wondering how to talk to your children about the Paris attacks? My colleague Anne Perkins has written an insightful how-to: It depends on their age, of course, but it seems to me that if a 9-year-old seems not to have heard about Paris, then leave it that way. On the other hand, a tempting conversational gambit like \u201chow was your day?\u201d may not reveal the whole truth. In my experience, that moment before lights out is the moment when some really searing observation can upset your equilibrium as well as theirs. At that point you have to stop and listen. Try to get them to explain what they know, and why it\u2019s scary. Acknowledge that it is reasonable to be scared and horrified. Only after, with your help and encouragement, they have talked through all their anxieties do you come back with the message you may have been bursting to hit them with from the beginning, the one about probability and risk. After all, you are much more likely to be run over by a car than to be the victim of a terror attack. Even the irrational horror of a school shooting can touch on the need for compassion and empathy. Paris, with all its tricky questions about terrorism, religion and the slaughter of people not much older than them, is in a way easier to talk about as well as more difficult. Easier, because there is an explanation, harder because it is complex. Lib\u00e9ration, the French daily, has done this brilliant but not simplistic explanation for kids on Le P\u2019tit Lib\u00e9 (in French). With French jets pounding the Islamic State stronghold of Raqqa, US planes targeting its oil tankers and Kurdish forces splitting a supply line from Mosul to Raqqa, the past three days have been among the most difficult that the terror group has faced in its self-declared caliphate. As the dust settles, Isis\u2019s hold on its original territory and revenues is, perhaps for the first time, showing signs of slipping. The group has lost control of the highway linking the two main hubs of its heartland. And the parallel oil trade, which had generated as much as $40m (\u00a326m) a month even while refineries were being bombed, is now in jeopardy. The Raqqa strikes, 20 in total, targeted parts of the city that had not been hit before, including a sports stadium, a museum, an equestrian centre and several administration buildings. Residents questioned the usefulness of the strikes, suggesting they had no military purpose, a claim countered by French officials who said planners of the Paris attacks on Friday had given final instructions to the suicide bombers from within Raqqa and that training camps were a primary target. Read the piece in full below and see here for more Guardian reads on Isis: Buried in President Hollande\u2019s earlier sombre speech to both Houses of Parliament is a warning that the European Union could unravel under the twin impact of the terrorism and immigration crises. France has already re-erected national border controls within the 26-country free-travel Schengen zone which has never been under greater stress. Hollande announced a further 1,000 national border control staff, underlining that Schengen has been suspended and raising questions about its survival as one of the biggest acts of European integration. \u201cIf Europe does not control its external borders, then it\u2019s back to national borders. This would be the dismantling of the European Union,\u201d Hollande warned. This is precisely the outcome sought by his likely opponent in the next presidential contest in 2017, Marine Le Pen, leader of the anti-EU, anti-immigration rightwing Front National. Rightwing nationalists all over Europe are seeking to capitalise on the Paris atrocities to deal a fatal blow to the EU - Nigel Farage in Britain, Geert Wilders in the Netherlands, Heinz-Christian Strache in Austria. None of these are in government, but the new rightwing government in Poland also says Paris means Warsaw has to regain national control of its borders, a view that is supported by the Slovak and Hungarian governments. Le Pen argued in \u2018I-told-you-so\u2019 remarks that the Paris attacks vindicated her nationalist and anti-immigrant demands. \u201cOur fears and warnings on the possible presence of jihadis among the migrants have now been turned into tangible reality unfortunately.\u201d EU interior ministers are to meet in emergency session on Friday in response to the Paris attacks, with robust arguments expected over the borders issue. The crisis puts Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany in a particularly tough spot as the main exponent of open borders and generous immigration policies. Welcome to our continuing coverage of the aftermath of the attacks in Paris. Here\u2019s what we know so far: Fran\u00e7ois Hollande calls for change to French constitution The French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, said France would intensify strikes against Islamic State in the coming days. France demands a rapid implementation of \u201ccoordinated and systematic controls\u201d of the EU\u2019s internal and external borders, he said. Hollande said he wanted French law to allow dual nationals to be stripped of their French citizenship if they were convicted of terrorism and called for the French constitution to be rewritten. Obama rules out boots on the ground The US president, Barack Obama, has said he will defy critics who have called for him to send in ground troops to defeat Isis, saying it would go against the advice of his military strategists. He also criticised the Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush for suggesting that refugees to the US should be primarily Christian. Obama said he had not been briefed on any intelligence indicating an attack in Paris was likely. Arrests made and suspects tracked across Europe A French official has identified the alleged mastermind of the Paris attacks as Belgian-born Abdelhamid Abu Oud. Two of the seven people detained in Belgium on Saturday are being held on terrorism charges, Belgian federal prosecutors have said. Five have been released, including the brother of two of the suspected attackers. After being released by Belgian police along with five others, Mohamed Abdeslam, said his family is unaware of his brother (fugitive suspect) Salah\u2019s whereabouts. Italian police in Turin have been told to look out for a black Seat that may have entered the country from France on Saturday and could be connected to the attacks in Paris. German authorities have arrested an Algerian asylum seeker, who they allege told associates early last week that bomb attacks were coming to Paris. Isis has released what appears to be a new propaganda video, warning of an attack in Washington DC. French police name more attackers Paris prosecutors have identified two more suicide bombers from Friday\u2019s attacks as Ahmad Almohammad and Samy Amimour, a French national. Syrian passport holder Almohammad, who is said to have blown himself up at the Stade de France, reportedly passed with refugees through the Greek island of Leros. A Turkish official has told the Guardian that Turkey twice informed French authorities about the suicide bomber Omar Isma\u00efl Mostefai, but only received an information request about him from France after the Paris attacks. French police continue to hunt for Salah Abdeslam, believed to be one of three brothers involved in Friday night\u2019s attack, who is on the run. A major Belgian raid on a street in Molenbeek, in the Brussels suburbs, did not locate him. Below are some posts from the previous live blog, which has now closed. The French prime minister, Manuel Valls, said on Monday that France will limit the events to core negotiations and will cancel planned marches and concerts in the wake of the attacks. This despite the fact that no foreign leaders had asked France to postpone the 30 November-11 December summit, which would amount to \u201cabdicating to the terrorists\u201d, Valls said. Environmental activists are due to meet later on Monday, Reuters reports, to rethink plans for a march on 29 November, the eve of the summit, that they had hoped would attract perhaps 200,000 people to put pressure on governments to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Mainstream groups say they will respect any bans, decreed under emergency powers in France after the attacks on Friday that France blamed on Islamic State. Uefa has announced that the Euro 2016 football tournament will remain in France. The country\u2019s hosting of the tournament has come under scrutiny since Friday\u2019s terrorist attacks in Paris. \u201cThe Euro final draw will go ahead as scheduled on 12 December at the Palais des Congres in Paris and the final tournament will be played in France from 10 June to 10 July 2016.\u201d But a statement from Uefa on Monday read: \u201cFor over three years now, [the tournament organising committee] Euro 2016 SAS has been working closely with the relevant authorities to develop the most appropriate mechanisms in order to guarantee there is a safe and secure tournament and we are confident that the necessary measures will be taken to ensure that is the case for all involved. France\u2019s 1958 World Cup star Just Fontaine was one prominent figure to call on the country to give up hosting rights, claiming: \u201cIt is simply too dangerous.\u201d Fontaine, 82, was present at the Stade de France on Friday night when the stadium was one of the venues targeted in what appeared to be coordinated attacks across the French capital. Mohamed Abdeslam, the brother of two suspects linked to the attacks on Friday in Paris was released by Belgian police this afternoon after several hours in custody. He spoke to the press in the eastern Brussels suburb of Molenbeek: He grew up here, He studied here,\u201d Mohamed said of his brother Salah, the fugitive suspect, in Molenbeek, Belgium. \u201cHe\u2019s a completely normal boy.\u201d Mohamed said he had been accused of taking part in terrorist acts after his arrest on Saturday, but that the investigating magistrate had believed his alibi for Friday evening. \u201cThere are plenty of people in the borough who know me, who know what I\u2019m capable of and what not.\u201d His parents, he added, were \u201cin shock.\u201d He said that like everyone else he had learnt of the atrocities from television. \u201cI am affected by what happened ... I think of the victims, of the families of the victims. But you will also understand that we have a mother, we have a family.\u201d More on his comments here. (via my colleague Ian Traynor)",

They killed with vengeance in their hearts and the words \u201cSyria\u201d and \u201cIraq\u201d on their lips. They brought a war that has raged unchecked in a distant region to the doorsteps and tables and bar counters of a faraway city that until now, despite previous attacks, had remained largely detached.</p> <p>That sense of separateness ended on Friday evening. If there was complacency, it too has disappeared entirely. Isis brought their fight to their enemy. As President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande declared on Saturday, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/nov/14/paris-terror-attacks-attackers-dead-mass-killing-live-updates\">France has been the target of an act of war</a>.</p> <p>France is not alone. The frightening sense of vulnerability that the attack has induced is shared by every citizen and every government in the alliance of countries \u2013 European, American and Arab \u2013 that vowed to purge Syria and Iraq of the Isis menace. There will be inquests among France\u2019s security establishment. There will be many questions to answer.</p> <p>Where did the eight gunmen come from? Were they French born and raised? How did they come by their weapons and their training \u2013 for well trained and disciplined they certainly were? Did they have accomplices among France\u2019s large Muslim community? Were they acting on their own initiative, as part of an unknown France-based cell, or were they following orders from Raqqa in Syria or from another Isis stronghold?</p> <p>Yet even if all these questions are answered fully and conclusively, this sense of a shared vulnerability, arising from Friday\u2019s horrors, will not be dispelled. In the final analysis, it is not possible to completely protect cities such as Paris, London, Brussels or Rome from suicidal, marauding, rolling assaults of this kind. To try to do so would be to risk destroying the very freedoms, the lifestyles and the open, tolerant cultures that the terrorists, with their twisted creed of hate and bigotry, detest so much. It would be to do the killers\u2019 job for them.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>France cannot afford an emotional descent into prejudice, ostracism and racism</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Increased surveillance measures may be necessary. Greater official intrusiveness into the private lives of citizens through expanded data and internet access laws may come to be seen as unavoidable. But total security is an illusion. And so, as France tries to learn the lessons and picks over the bones of this latest atrocity, every democratic country in the world has an intimate interest in its findings \u2013 and in knowing what more might be done to strike an acceptable balance between safety and liberty.</p> <p>France is not alone. In its grief and anger, there is a very real risk Friday\u2019s outrage may inflame political tensions, and not only in France. The solidarity shown by a million marchers after the killings at <em>Charlie Hebdo</em> magazine in Paris in January was impressive, but fleeting. There were similar outpourings across Europe. The real danger now is that, as the sharp pang of fear subsides, many will start looking for somebody or something to blame.</p> <p>Members of France\u2019s substantial Muslim minority are obvious targets in a country where policies of assimilation, preferred to British-style multiculturalism, have failed in significant respects. Often consigned to low-paid jobs and desolate housing projects, offended by the secular republic\u2019s inflexible disdain for the veil and other symbols of the Islamic faith, insecure in their standing as equal citizens, and volubly abused by extremist and far-right groups, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/14/france-the-secular-seat-of-europe-to-lose-so-many-to-radical-islam\">France\u2019s Muslims</a> will fear a backlash.</p> <p>Confrontation on the streets is a possibility. But also at the ballot box. Next month will see regional elections across France in which the xenophobic, always divisive Front National led by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/marine-le-pen\">Marine Le Pen</a> was already expected to do exceptionally well. What happened in Paris may now fuel the FN\u2019s rise. Politicians from Hollande\u2019s Socialist party and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/nicolas-sarkozy\">Nicolas Sarkozy</a>\u2019s centre-right bloc thus face an urgent challenge in ensuring, together, that the broadly moderate centre holds.</p> <p>France cannot afford an emotional descent into prejudice, ostracism and racism. Nor can Europe. In Germany, in Britain, in Poland and elsewhere, rightwing extremist parties that habitually target and scapegoat Muslims, particularly Muslim refugees from Syria, would like nothing better than to see France lapse into polarisation, recrimination and deepening division. It would suit the purposes of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/isis\">Isis</a> and al-Qaida, too, should Friday\u2019s events serve further to radicalise and divide. How else may fanatics of their ugly stripe hope to impose their will? For these reasons, all of Europe\u2019s political class must now stand with France.</p> <p>France is not alone. For neither France alone, nor any other single country, could now begin to master the enormous challenges posed by the spreading Isis cancer. Since the <em>Charlie Hebdo</em> attacks, Isis gunmen and suicide bombers have struck repeatedly and over a large area. Last month, they killed more than 100 people in Turkey. Last summer, they sprayed beaches with bullets in Tunisia. Last week, they <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/12/beirut-bombings-kill-at-least-20-lebanon\">caused carnage</a> in a Shia Muslim neighbourhood in Beirut.</p> <p>Isis also destroyed a Russian airliner over Sinai this month, killing all 224 people on board, apparently in retaliation for President Vladimir Putin\u2019s decision to intervene militarily in Syria. Although Moscow has yet to officially confirm that an Isis bomb caused the disaster, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3317361/Russia-bans-EgyptAir-flights-Nov-14-airport-official-says.html\">there seems little doubt that it did</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7a9019e6b4aed83e4cf48ca30b3b042ca3c8e958\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a9019e6b4aed83e4cf48ca30b3b042ca3c8e958/0_137_4096_2456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lebanese mourner, funeral, Beirut\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Lebanese mourner fires into the air at a funeral for victims of an attack by an Isis suicide bomber last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wael Hamzeh/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The attack on the Russian plane indicated that Isis now presents a higher level of threat than had been previously understood. If Isis was able to circumvent all the elaborate security measures introduced by airlines and airports since the 9/11 attacks, then at this point, no future flight, train or tube journey seems wholly safe.</p> <p>If that alarming conclusion is to be overturned, concerted international action is needed on this and on other aspects of co-operative security. In Europe, the EU commission could play a crucial co-ordinating role. After its abject failure to manage the migrant crisis, helping to reassure the French and improve safety standards in Europe\u2019s public places could be a major plus.</p> <p>France is not alone. It is part of a coalition formed to \u201cdegrade and destroy\u201d Isis, in Barack Obama\u2019s words. Its combat aircraft have been in action over Syria and Iraq for several months. Hollande recently dispatched an aircraft carrier to the eastern Mediterranean. In its statement claiming responsibility on Saturday, Isis said it was France\u2019s role in these operations that led to the Paris attacks.</p> <p>Even so, it is the Americans who perform most of the air combat missions. Britain, to the annoyance of Washington and to the evident chagrin of David Cameron and his defence secretary, Michael Fallon, is involved in Iraq, but not in Syria. The Arab members of the coalition, including Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Qatar, have largely diverted their planes to the war against Iranian-backed rebels in Yemen.</p> <p>The Turks are more interested in bombing Kurds than jihadis. Canada\u2019s new prime minister, Justin Trudeau, is pulling out of the campaign altogether. The Russians, meanwhile, do their own thing, which is more about propping Syria\u2019s embattled president, Bashar al-Assad, than defeating Isis.</p> <p>It must be plain even to the inexpert eye that such a chaotic, incoherent military effort is unlikely to meet with any great success, even if it includes credible ground forces, which at present it does not. Again, what is needed, more urgently than ever, is a more co-ordinated approach. A common strategy with common objectives and a common approach is what is required to make the air war against Isis more effective. And after Paris, there will be pressure on Jeremy Corbyn to reconsider Labour\u2019s opposition to extending RAF operations into Syria.</p> <p>Crucially, this stepped-up effort must include greater command and operational integration with the Russians. This is not to say Crimea\u2019s annexation is suddenly forgiven. Putin\u2019s vandalism in eastern Ukraine is not forgotten either. Moscow under current management is a difficult and unreliable partner. But the urgency of the present threat demands that these concerns be set aside, for the time being at least, in order to defeat the greater evil.</p> <p>In the end, however, more war is not the answer. If other European and Middle Eastern cities are to avoid the agony experienced by Paris, the international community must finally tackle head on the problem that lies at the heart of this rolling, expanding terrorist crisis \u2013 Syria.</p> <p>The civil war has now been raging for more than four years. More than half the country\u2019s population is displaced. Millions have fled to Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon. Hundreds of thousands are now heading for Europe, a massively destabilising event that daily threatens the unity of the EU itself.</p> <p>The anarchy inside Syria has allowed Isis, and other groups linked to al-Qaida, to seize territory and wealth. They feed on the chaos caused by the war. And yet half-baked international peace efforts have repeatedly floundered. Building on the recent, more inclusive peace process sponsored by the UN, it is high time to <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/11/14/us-syria-crisis-talks-idUSKCN0T22HN20151114#yveX0OO1WtqfoU1i.97\">end this impasse</a>.</p> <p>The US, Russia, Britain, France, the leading Arab states and Iran, too, all now have an ever more obvious, shared interest in ending an incredibly destructive conflict that threatens us all. They must act together \u2013 and so prove, conclusively, that France, at this time of terrible anguish, is not alone.</p> <p>\u2022 Comments will be opened later today</p> <h2>TERRORISM</h2>",

To try to do so would be to risk destroying the very freedoms, the lifestyles and the open, tolerant cultures that the terrorists, with their twisted creed of hate and bigotry, detest so much. It would be to do the killers\u2019 job for them. Increased surveillance measures may be necessary. Greater official intrusiveness into the private lives of citizens through expanded data and internet access laws may come to be seen as unavoidable. But total security is an illusion. And so, as France tries to learn the lessons and picks over the bones of this latest atrocity, every democratic country in the world has an intimate interest in its findings \u2013 and in knowing what more might be done to strike an acceptable balance between safety and liberty. France is not alone. In its grief and anger, there is a very real risk Friday\u2019s outrage may inflame political tensions, and not only in France. The solidarity shown by a million marchers after the killings at Charlie Hebdo magazine in Paris in January was impressive, but fleeting. There were similar outpourings across Europe. The real danger now is that, as the sharp pang of fear subsides, many will start looking for somebody or something to blame. Members of France\u2019s substantial Muslim minority are obvious targets in a country where policies of assimilation, preferred to British-style multiculturalism, have failed in significant respects. Often consigned to low-paid jobs and desolate housing projects, offended by the secular republic\u2019s inflexible disdain for the veil and other symbols of the Islamic faith, insecure in their standing as equal citizens, and volubly abused by extremist and far-right groups, France\u2019s Muslims will fear a backlash. Confrontation on the streets is a possibility. But also at the ballot box. Next month will see regional elections across France in which the xenophobic, always divisive Front National led by Marine Le Pen was already expected to do exceptionally well. What happened in Paris may now fuel the FN\u2019s rise. Politicians from Hollande\u2019s Socialist party and Nicolas Sarkozy\u2019s centre-right bloc thus face an urgent challenge in ensuring, together, that the broadly moderate centre holds. France cannot afford an emotional descent into prejudice, ostracism and racism. Nor can Europe. In Germany, in Britain, in Poland and elsewhere, rightwing extremist parties that habitually target and scapegoat Muslims, particularly Muslim refugees from Syria, would like nothing better than to see France lapse into polarisation, recrimination and deepening division. It would suit the purposes of Isis and al-Qaida, too, should Friday\u2019s events serve further to radicalise and divide. How else may fanatics of their ugly stripe hope to impose their will? For these reasons, all of Europe\u2019s political class must now stand with France. France is not alone. For neither France alone, nor any other single country, could now begin to master the enormous challenges posed by the spreading Isis cancer. Since the Charlie Hebdo attacks, Isis gunmen and suicide bombers have struck repeatedly and over a large area. Last month, they killed more than 100 people in Turkey. Last summer, they sprayed beaches with bullets in Tunisia. Last week, they caused carnage in a Shia Muslim neighbourhood in Beirut. Isis also destroyed a Russian airliner over Sinai this month, killing all 224 people on board, apparently in retaliation for President Vladimir Putin\u2019s decision to intervene militarily in Syria. Although Moscow has yet to officially confirm that an Isis bomb caused the disaster, there seems little doubt that it did. The attack on the Russian plane indicated that Isis now presents a higher level of threat than had been previously understood. If Isis was able to circumvent all the elaborate security measures introduced by airlines and airports since the 9/11 attacks, then at this point, no future flight, train or tube journey seems wholly safe. If that alarming conclusion is to be overturned, concerted international action is needed on this and on other aspects of co-operative security. In Europe, the EU commission could play a crucial co-ordinating role. After its abject failure to manage the migrant crisis, helping to reassure the French and improve safety standards in Europe\u2019s public places could be a major plus. France is not alone. It is part of a coalition formed to \u201cdegrade and destroy\u201d Isis, in Barack Obama\u2019s words. Its combat aircraft have been in action over Syria and Iraq for several months. Hollande recently dispatched an aircraft carrier to the eastern Mediterranean. In its statement claiming responsibility on Saturday, Isis said it was France\u2019s role in these operations that led to the Paris attacks. Even so, it is the Americans who perform most of the air combat missions. Britain, to the annoyance of Washington and to the evident chagrin of David Cameron and his defence secretary, Michael Fallon, is involved in Iraq, but not in Syria. The Arab members of the coalition, including Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Qatar, have largely diverted their planes to the war against Iranian-backed rebels in Yemen. The Turks are more interested in bombing Kurds than jihadis. Canada\u2019s new prime minister, Justin Trudeau, is pulling out of the campaign altogether. The Russians, meanwhile, do their own thing, which is more about propping Syria\u2019s embattled president, Bashar al-Assad, than defeating Isis. It must be plain even to the inexpert eye that such a chaotic, incoherent military effort is unlikely to meet with any great success, even if it includes credible ground forces, which at present it does not. Again, what is needed, more urgently than ever, is a more co-ordinated approach. A common strategy with common objectives and a common approach is what is required to make the air war against Isis more effective. And after Paris, there will be pressure on Jeremy Corbyn to reconsider Labour\u2019s opposition to extending RAF operations into Syria. Crucially, this stepped-up effort must include greater command and operational integration with the Russians. This is not to say Crimea\u2019s annexation is suddenly forgiven. Putin\u2019s vandalism in eastern Ukraine is not forgotten either. Moscow under current management is a difficult and unreliable partner. But the urgency of the present threat demands that these concerns be set aside, for the time being at least, in order to defeat the greater evil. In the end, however, more war is not the answer. If other European and Middle Eastern cities are to avoid the agony experienced by Paris, the international community must finally tackle head on the problem that lies at the heart of this rolling, expanding terrorist crisis \u2013 Syria. The civil war has now been raging for more than four years. More than half the country\u2019s population is displaced. Millions have fled to Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon. Hundreds of thousands are now heading for Europe, a massively destabilising event that daily threatens the unity of the EU itself. The anarchy inside Syria has allowed Isis, and other groups linked to al-Qaida, to seize territory and wealth. They feed on the chaos caused by the war. And yet half-baked international peace efforts have repeatedly floundered. Building on the recent, more inclusive peace process sponsored by the UN, it is high time to end this impasse. The US, Russia, Britain, France, the leading Arab states and Iran, too, all now have an ever more obvious, shared interest in ending an incredibly destructive conflict that threatens us all. They must act together \u2013 and so prove, conclusively, that France, at this time of terrible anguish, is not alone. \u2022 Comments will be opened later today TERRORISM",

          "bodyText": "World leaders have condemned Friday\u2019s terror attacks in Paris, as cities across the world stepped up security in response to the killings. The UK prime minister, David Cameron, warned the country to be prepared for the possibility that Britons could be among the casualties, while the Queen expressed her shock and sadness at the killings. In a message to her fellow head of state, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, she said: \u201cPrince Philip and I have been deeply shocked and saddened by the terrible loss of life in Paris. We send our most sincere condolences to you, the families of those who have died and the French people.\u201d The US president, Barack Obama, condemned the atrocities, in which at least 127 people died. And on Friday night, the United Nations security council called the attacks \u201cbarbaric and cowardly\u201d. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and Pope Francis were also among the world leaders to express their condolences. They were joined by the London mayor, Boris Johnson, who said he had written to his Parisian counterpart, Anne Hidalgo. In an address at the White House, Obama said: \u201cIt\u2019s an attack not just on the people of France. But this is an attack on all of humanity and the universal values we share. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do whatever it takes to work with the French people and with nations around the world to bring these terrorists to justice and to go after any terrorist networks that go after our people.\u201d The US secretary of state, John Kerry, called the attacks \u201cheinous, evil\u201d and \u201cvile\u201d and \u201can assault on our common humanity\u201d. Kerry said the American embassy in Paris was trying to confirm the safety of US citizens, adding that Washington was ready to provide whatever support the French government may require. Putin sent his deep condolences to Hollande and the people of France following the \u201chorrible terrorist attacks in Paris\u201d, the Kremlin said in a statement. \u201cRussia strongly condemns this inhumane killing and is ready to provide any and all assistance to investigate these terrorist crimes.\u201d Pope Francis added his condemnation, telling the Catholic television channel TV2000 the attacks were \u201cnot human\u201d and \u201cthere is no religious or human justification for it\u201d. He said: \u201cI am close to the people of France, to the families of the victims, and I am praying for all of them. I am moved and I am saddened. I do not understand, these things hard to understand.\u201d The leaders of other countries that have been targeted by terrorism joined the chorus of condemnation. Jos\u00e9 Manuel Garc\u00eda-Margallo, the Spanish foreign minister, where 191 people were killed in train bombings in 2004, warned of possible repeat attacks by jihadis. \u201cAll of this confirms that we are facing an unprecedented challenge, a hugely cruel challenge\u201d, he told public television TVE. India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, whose country was hit by two attacks in 2006 and 2008, tweeted: The Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, said: \u201cIsrael stands shoulder to shoulder with French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and with the people of France in our common battle against terrorism.\u201d Angela Merkel said she was \u201cprofoundly shocked by the news and images from Paris\u201d.

          "bodyText": "Trade and economic ties are expected to be the focus of Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s first visit to Jakarta as prime minister on Thursday. The prime minister will miss the final sitting day of parliament to hold the first face-to-face meeting with the Indonesia president, Joko Widodo, since the execution by firing squad in April of the Bali Nine duo, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran. Turnbull\u2019s visit is an attempt to reset one of Australia\u2019s most important regional relationships and to move on deepening economic ties before next week\u2019s visit by the trade minister, Andrew Robb. Tony Abbott came to government declaring he would pursue a foreign policy which prioritised \u201cJakarta, not Geneva\u201d, but the bilateral relationship was buffeted by tensions over asylum boat turnbacks, revelations Australia had spied on, or attempted to spy on, the president Susilo Yudhoyono, his wife and nine members of their inner circle in 2009 and, later, the executions of Chan and Sukumaran. While cooperation continued at the diplomatic level throughout the fracture prompted by the Bali Nine executions, ministerial visits between the two countries only resumed in August. Widodo began his term by implementing a raft of protectionist measures but more recent signs suggest the government in Jakarta is rethinking its initial populist, anti-liberalisation trade stance. Indonesia has signalled it now wants to join the trans-Pacific partnership, the controversial trade pact between 12 economies including Australia, Canada, Japan, Mexico, Vietnam and the US. The TPP, if formalised, will create the world\u2019s largest free trade area. The US-led deal, as well as prompting trade liberalisation, is seen by many analysts as a strategic counterbalance to growing Chinese economic power and influence in the region. Robb will follow up Turnbull\u2019s visit to Jakarta, taking a trade delegation after the meeting in Manila of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation \u2013 a grouping of 21 Pacific Rim economies. Apec\u2019s core objective is trade liberalisation. Turnbull will continue on from Jakarta to visit Berlin \u2013 meeting the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, on Friday. That visit will also have a business focus but, given the proximity of looming UN-led climate talks in Paris, and Europe\u2019s continuing migration crisis, international climate policy and immigration are also expected to be addressed during the one-day visit. Turnbull will round out his trip by attending the G20 summit in Turkey, the Apec talks in Manila, and the east Asia summit in Kuala Lumpur. Over the course of the summits, the Australian prime minister is expected to hold his first bilateral meetings with major counterparts, including Barack Obama, Britain\u2019s prime minister, David Cameron, the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, and the new Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau. Turnbull will be accompanied for much of the visit by his wife, Lucy, and the finance minister, Mathias Cormann.",

Ironically, the <a href=\"http://ozone.unep.org/en/treaties-and-decisions\" title=\"\">Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer (1987)</a> encouraged the use of HFCs to replace the more toxic, ozone-depleting HCFCs (hydrochlorofluorocarbons) and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) then being used in refrigerants and aerosols.</p> <p>But, as production of HFCs increased exponentially, it was discovered that they generate greenhouse gases even more potent than the HCFCs and CFCs they were used to replace. Meanwhile, the ozone layer keeps shrinking, and the ultraviolet rays from the sun it is there to protect us from are still causing skin cancers, and undermining the growth of ocean plankton.</p> <p>As a consequence, at last month\u2019s 27th Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol in Dubai, the participating 197 member countries <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/30/worlds-climate-pledges-likely-to-lead-to-less-than-3c-of-warming-un\" title=\"\">agreed to launch to launch new negotiations on phasing out some HFCs worldwide</a>.<br><strong>Richard Orlando</strong><br>Westmount, Quebec, Canada</p> <h2><strong>Injustice in Chicago</strong><br></h2> <p>The shocking disclosures of the clandestine interrogation and detention of predominantly marginalised African-American and Latino residents of Chicago, thanks to the moral and legal persistence of the Guardian, is reminiscent of the dehumanising intimidatory practices of the Nazis, Stalin\u2019s police and Apartheid South Africa\u2019s Special Branch unit <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/19/homan-square-chicago-police-disappeared-thousands\" title=\"\">(23 October)</a>.</p> <p>This story would certainly not have been investigated by a largely corporate-dominated American media, which often chooses to dismiss the dysfunctional characteristics of what is a shadow of a democratic society. The compelling evidence presented in the article exposes an attitude of plausible deniability frequently adopted by those who exercise authority and power. Unfortunately, this dangerous Orwellian spectre will continue, in spite of the valiant efforts to further expose these draconian methods.<br><strong>Michael Herman</strong><br>Brampton, Ontario, Canada</p> <p>\u2022 Spencer Ackerman\u2019s report says \u201cpolice allowed lawyers access to Homan Square for only 0.94% of the 7,185 arrests\u201d. Figures stated in that form fairly beg to be rechecked. If there were 67 cases, that would be 0.9325% or, rounded to two significant figures, 0.93%. And if there were 68, that would be 0.9464%, rounded (up, standardly) to 0.95%.</p> <p>Either the raw number or \u201cless than 1%\u201d would have inspired more confidence.<br><strong>Lee Hartman</strong><br>Carbondale, Illinois, US</p> <h2><strong>Catholic church and women</strong><br></h2> <p>Your leader Choose what\u2019s best for women <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/23/the-guardian-view-on-the-popes-divisions-he-should-choose-whats-best-for-women\" title=\"\">(30 October)</a> contains at least two false premises. The first is that the influence of the pope and the Catholic church is universally beneficial to women. The second is that this influence should be preserved, and that this can only happen by the pope attempting to juggle the seemingly incompatible demands for religious acceptance, guidance and redemption in the new and old worlds.</p> <p>In the first place, the church\u2019s dogmatic tenet is that sex is only permissible in a sanctified relationship between a man and a woman. The church also strongly suggests that a woman\u2019s primary role in such a marriage is to bear more Catholic children. Both men and women are increasingly rejecting these strictures, with their reproductive organs and with their&#xa0;hearts.</p> <p>The second premise is a plea for the impossible, and your conclusion that it should at least be tried is flawed in more ways than one. The sooner the pernicious influence of this paternalistic institution is diminished, the more it will benefit humanity, as well as protect this increasingly fragile planet by encouraging control of our burgeoning population.<br><strong>Noel Bird</strong><br>Boreen Point, Queensland, Australia</p> <h2><strong>Independence for Scotland</strong><br></h2> <p>Martin Kettle <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/15/scottish-independence-snp-pro-union\" title=\"\">(23 October)</a> continues to disappoint on the subject of Scotland and the SNP. Kettle\u2019s most recent effort purported to be about Scotland, but was actually about the UK. His columns use the SNP as a coat hanger for his ideas about pro-union strategy. That is not a problem if it is honest.</p> <p>However, I expect a more nuanced analysis of social democracy, nationalism and separation from the Guardian. It is not \u201ca mistake to imagine that the SNP\u2019s appeal is \u2018really\u2019 about social democracy and not nationalism\u201d. That bald statement of his was unsupported by evidence, probably because it is unsupportable. Were it true, the SNP would have come to power a long time ago. It has taken a long time for Scots to become so disheartened by the neglect of their concerns to finally opt for separation.</p> <p>Nationalism comes in many guises: some ugly, most problematic. Social democracy is, however, something earnestly desired by many people in Scotland \u2013 and indeed beyond. The concept of civil society and the public good has been under threat since free market economics took over in the UK.</p> <p>If Nicola Sturgeon can bring it into being in Scotland, but requires separation to do that, good luck to her! That is not nationalism; it is separation from a Westminster government that does not care about ordinary people.<br><strong>Rosemary Ommer</strong><br>Salt Spring Island, British Columbia, Canada</p> <p>\u2022 The article Scots aren\u2019t destined to break free draws on the Canada/Quebec experience and suggests that defeating a second Scottish secession referendum \u201cis critical\u201d. However, an important point learned here in North America is that the threat of a repeat referendum is a continuum, with the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois simply biding its time until it feels that conditions are opportune for the result desired.</p> <p>This political football match is governed by different rules to those of sport: no matter how many referendums decide for maintaining the status quo, one win by the separatists triggers separation. So, the actuality is a sequence of referendums, all of which have to be defeated to keep Scotland in the&#xa0;Union.<br><strong>Anthony Walter</strong><br>Surrey, British Columbia, Canada</p> <h2><strong>Briefly</strong><br></h2> <p>\u2022 It\u2019s been very encouraging to see the Guardian take on such an active role in addressing the challenges involved in achieving outcomes at the Paris climate negotiations which will prevent the disastrous scenario the planet is now facing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/30/worlds-climate-pledges-likely-to-lead-to-less-than-3c-of-warming-un\" title=\"\">(6&#xa0;November)</a>. It\u2019s been disappointing, however, to see you picking up expressions like \u201cdeal\u201d and \u201cgame changer\u201d to describe the negotiations.</p> <p>These are surely more appropriate to business negotiations or sporting events, and fail to capture the significance of climate change for the thousands of people facing the devastation of their livelihoods and even death because of the atmospheric and oceanic dynamics already in progress.<br><strong>Wendy Flannery</strong><br>Brisbane, Australia</p> <p>\u2022 The <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/m/touch/news/story/1.3281191\" title=\"\">eulogy Justin Trudeau gave</a>, at age 28, at his father\u2019s funeral included the following: \u201cSimple tolerance, mere tolerance, is not enough; we need genuine and deep respect for each and every human being, notwithstanding their thoughts, their values, their beliefs, their origins. That\u2019s what my father demanded of his sons and that\u2019s what he demanded of his country.\u201d</p> <p>More important than talk of a Trudeau dynasty is the hope that as Canada\u2019s new prime minister, Justin Trudeau can deliver on his father\u2019s belief.<br><strong>Tom Edmonds</strong><br>Cowansville, Quebec, Canada</p> <p>\u2022 The whole point of the Odyssey was trying against all odds to get home <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/24/syrians-refugees-migrants-lesbos-winter\" title=\"\">(30 October)</a>.

Consumption of processed meat can only account for a very small proportion of cases, and mentioning this risk in the same context as tobacco smoking is hugely misleading, as cigarette smoking accounts for the vast majority of lung cancers.</p> <p>But perhaps there\u2019s a clue here as to what the culprit might be: passive consumption of processed meat \u2013 that mouth-watering aroma of sizzling bacon can\u2019t be doing any of us any good!<br><strong>Malcolm Faddy</strong><br>Maleny, Queensland, Australia</p> <p><em>Email letters for publication to </em><a href=\"mailto:weekly.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><em>weekly.letters@theguardian.com</em></a><em> </em></p>",

As a consequence, at last month\u2019s 27th Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol in Dubai, the participating 197 member countries agreed to launch to launch new negotiations on phasing out some HFCs worldwide. Richard Orlando Westmount, Quebec, Canada Injustice in Chicago The shocking disclosures of the clandestine interrogation and detention of predominantly marginalised African-American and Latino residents of Chicago, thanks to the moral and legal persistence of the Guardian, is reminiscent of the dehumanising intimidatory practices of the Nazis, Stalin\u2019s police and Apartheid South Africa\u2019s Special Branch unit (23 October). This story would certainly not have been investigated by a largely corporate-dominated American media, which often chooses to dismiss the dysfunctional characteristics of what is a shadow of a democratic society. The compelling evidence presented in the article exposes an attitude of plausible deniability frequently adopted by those who exercise authority and power. Unfortunately, this dangerous Orwellian spectre will continue, in spite of the valiant efforts to further expose these draconian methods. Michael Herman Brampton, Ontario, Canada \u2022 Spencer Ackerman\u2019s report says \u201cpolice allowed lawyers access to Homan Square for only 0.94% of the 7,185 arrests\u201d. Figures stated in that form fairly beg to be rechecked. If there were 67 cases, that would be 0.9325% or, rounded to two significant figures, 0.93%. And if there were 68, that would be 0.9464%, rounded (up, standardly) to 0.95%. Either the raw number or \u201cless than 1%\u201d would have inspired more confidence. Lee Hartman Carbondale, Illinois, US Catholic church and women Your leader Choose what\u2019s best for women (30 October) contains at least two false premises. The first is that the influence of the pope and the Catholic church is universally beneficial to women. The second is that this influence should be preserved, and that this can only happen by the pope attempting to juggle the seemingly incompatible demands for religious acceptance, guidance and redemption in the new and old worlds. In the first place, the church\u2019s dogmatic tenet is that sex is only permissible in a sanctified relationship between a man and a woman. The church also strongly suggests that a woman\u2019s primary role in such a marriage is to bear more Catholic children. Both men and women are increasingly rejecting these strictures, with their reproductive organs and with their hearts. The second premise is a plea for the impossible, and your conclusion that it should at least be tried is flawed in more ways than one. The sooner the pernicious influence of this paternalistic institution is diminished, the more it will benefit humanity, as well as protect this increasingly fragile planet by encouraging control of our burgeoning population. Noel Bird Boreen Point, Queensland, Australia Independence for Scotland Martin Kettle (23 October) continues to disappoint on the subject of Scotland and the SNP. Kettle\u2019s most recent effort purported to be about Scotland, but was actually about the UK. His columns use the SNP as a coat hanger for his ideas about pro-union strategy. That is not a problem if it is honest. However, I expect a more nuanced analysis of social democracy, nationalism and separation from the Guardian. It is not \u201ca mistake to imagine that the SNP\u2019s appeal is \u2018really\u2019 about social democracy and not nationalism\u201d. That bald statement of his was unsupported by evidence, probably because it is unsupportable. Were it true, the SNP would have come to power a long time ago. It has taken a long time for Scots to become so disheartened by the neglect of their concerns to finally opt for separation. Nationalism comes in many guises: some ugly, most problematic. Social democracy is, however, something earnestly desired by many people in Scotland \u2013 and indeed beyond. The concept of civil society and the public good has been under threat since free market economics took over in the UK. If Nicola Sturgeon can bring it into being in Scotland, but requires separation to do that, good luck to her! That is not nationalism; it is separation from a Westminster government that does not care about ordinary people. Rosemary Ommer Salt Spring Island, British Columbia, Canada \u2022 The article Scots aren\u2019t destined to break free draws on the Canada/Quebec experience and suggests that defeating a second Scottish secession referendum \u201cis critical\u201d. However, an important point learned here in North America is that the threat of a repeat referendum is a continuum, with the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois simply biding its time until it feels that conditions are opportune for the result desired. This political football match is governed by different rules to those of sport: no matter how many referendums decide for maintaining the status quo, one win by the separatists triggers separation. So, the actuality is a sequence of referendums, all of which have to be defeated to keep Scotland in the Union. Anthony Walter Surrey, British Columbia, Canada Briefly \u2022 It\u2019s been very encouraging to see the Guardian take on such an active role in addressing the challenges involved in achieving outcomes at the Paris climate negotiations which will prevent the disastrous scenario the planet is now facing (6 November). It\u2019s been disappointing, however, to see you picking up expressions like \u201cdeal\u201d and \u201cgame changer\u201d to describe the negotiations. These are surely more appropriate to business negotiations or sporting events, and fail to capture the significance of climate change for the thousands of people facing the devastation of their livelihoods and even death because of the atmospheric and oceanic dynamics already in progress. Wendy Flannery Brisbane, Australia \u2022 The eulogy Justin Trudeau gave, at age 28, at his father\u2019s funeral included the following: \u201cSimple tolerance, mere tolerance, is not enough; we need genuine and deep respect for each and every human being, notwithstanding their thoughts, their values, their beliefs, their origins. That\u2019s what my father demanded of his sons and that\u2019s what he demanded of his country.\u201d More important than talk of a Trudeau dynasty is the hope that as Canada\u2019s new prime minister, Justin Trudeau can deliver on his father\u2019s belief. Tom Edmonds Cowansville, Quebec, Canada \u2022 The whole point of the Odyssey was trying against all odds to get home (30 October). Rashid al-Shabai, like all refugees sharing his \u201codyssey\u201d, is fleeing home. Another word, please. Warwick Ruse Brunswick, Victoria, Australia \u2022 After admitting that the increase in cancer risk from eating processed meats is small (30 October), the question remains as to what else causes colorectal cancer. Consumption of processed meat can only account for a very small proportion of cases, and mentioning this risk in the same context as tobacco smoking is hugely misleading, as cigarette smoking accounts for the vast majority of lung cancers. But perhaps there\u2019s a clue here as to what the culprit might be: passive consumption of processed meat \u2013 that mouth-watering aroma of sizzling bacon can\u2019t be doing any of us any good!

A <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/25/justin-trudeau-conservative-canada-canadians-stephen-harper\">snappy response</a>, but an odd one.</p> <p>You could only say that and believe it if you thought that time inevitably brings moral advancement, that history points in one direction, and that the mere passage of the years is enough to deliver certain the political outcomes you find congenial.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/25/justin-trudeau-conservative-canada-canadians-stephen-harper\">Justin Trudeau is shiny yet familiar \u2013 perfect for conservative Canada | Leah McLaren</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s the reason that liberals like Trudeau and Obama like to call themselves \u201cprogressives\u201d. Deep down they think that modernity delivers not only change, but also betterment, and at worst needs a helpful nudge from time to time.</p> <p>As a counterpoint, consider that there are other things that have happened to women in 2015 which are awful and not very progressive at all. If we could ask Isis brides, the women and girls fleeing the Middle East and Central America, those killed by their partners, or those whose real incomes are steadily falling in Canada, Australia and throughout the developed world, they may have a different story to tell about the inevitability of progressive change.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t just nit-picking; it goes to a highly contestable theory of change that is deeply embedded in liberalism, and shared more broadly as a kind of post-Enlightenment common sense.</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t reflect the way in which political victories are made, though. Whatever victories feminism and other social movements have achieved are as a result of people successfully articulating and pressing particular political demands. When this takes place, it does so in particular places, times and political contexts, and is always reversible.</p> <p>Gender parity in government is both just and laudable, but putting it down to the inevitable march of history does a disservice to those who have struggled for it to happen. More importantly, it blinds us to the fact that every such victory is contingent. History can always hare off in a direction we don\u2019t like.</p> <p>Rightwingers understands this, and never stop trying to roll things back. If you look at the condition of the welfare state, voting rights, or recent recruitment among online antifeminists and the \u201calt-right\u201d, you\u2019ll see that they frequently succeed.</p> <p>Even those religious fundamentalists who are most convinced of the looming apocalypse are rarely so complacent as to leave anything to history.</p> <p>Despite all this, Trudeau\u2019s remark seemed to create as much excitement on the liberal left as the diversity he had implemented. Perhaps, despite everything modernity has taught us about the savagery that lurks just under the surface of even the most technologically advanced societies, or which is built into their structures, we want politicians to testify to their belief that human history has a singular, forward momentum.</p> <p>Perhaps liberals like Trudeau make us feel good in these moments of victory because they allow us to suspend our political disbelief. Maybe they allow us to think that stern conservatives like Trudeau\u2019s predecessor, Stephen Harper, are mere mistakes, wrong turns on the journey to a better tomorrow.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2015/nov/05/canada-justin-trudeau-introduces-new-gender-equal-cabinet-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4evca\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2401660\"            data-video-name=\"Canada's Justin Trudeau introduces new gender-equal cabinet \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/11/5/1446704527418/KP_590425_crop_640x480.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-563af59ae4b08cd6489b7158\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/11/5/1446704527418/KP_590425_crop_640x480.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/11/05/151105TrudeauPresser_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2015/11/05/151105TrudeauPresser_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/11/05/151105TrudeauPresser.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/11/05/151105TrudeauPresser_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2015/11/05/151105TrudeauPresser_large.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption>Justin Trudeau and cabinet.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>In this mood, conservatives may appear as less the persistent, integral part of modernity that they are and more as a holdover from the past, which will soon pass.</p> <p>Will Trudeau-mania be one of those repeated episodes of misplaced relief, where we talk and act as if the forces of reaction have finally been consigned to the past, where we think they belong?</p> <p>If any of this is true, it may explain the dream run that Malcolm Turnbull is having in Australia at the moment. Just as Trudeau rubbed out Harper, Turnbull consigned Harper\u2019s bosom pal, Tony Abbott, to political oblivion.</p> <p>By shifting the tone of the political discussion, through a difference in emphasis, and by virtue of being considerably less rigid and strange, Turnbull has won over the vast majority of the Australian people, including large elements of the liberal left.</p> <p>Like Trudeau, and unlike the men they respectively replaced, Turnbull has the air of someone who lives in the present and is oriented to the future.

          "bodyText": "Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau says that half his cabinet are women \u201cbecause it\u2019s 2015\u201d. A snappy response, but an odd one. You could only say that and believe it if you thought that time inevitably brings moral advancement, that history points in one direction, and that the mere passage of the years is enough to deliver certain the political outcomes you find congenial. It\u2019s the reason that liberals like Trudeau and Obama like to call themselves \u201cprogressives\u201d. Deep down they think that modernity delivers not only change, but also betterment, and at worst needs a helpful nudge from time to time. As a counterpoint, consider that there are other things that have happened to women in 2015 which are awful and not very progressive at all. If we could ask Isis brides, the women and girls fleeing the Middle East and Central America, those killed by their partners, or those whose real incomes are steadily falling in Canada, Australia and throughout the developed world, they may have a different story to tell about the inevitability of progressive change. This isn\u2019t just nit-picking; it goes to a highly contestable theory of change that is deeply embedded in liberalism, and shared more broadly as a kind of post-Enlightenment common sense. It doesn\u2019t reflect the way in which political victories are made, though. Whatever victories feminism and other social movements have achieved are as a result of people successfully articulating and pressing particular political demands. When this takes place, it does so in particular places, times and political contexts, and is always reversible. Gender parity in government is both just and laudable, but putting it down to the inevitable march of history does a disservice to those who have struggled for it to happen. More importantly, it blinds us to the fact that every such victory is contingent. History can always hare off in a direction we don\u2019t like. Rightwingers understands this, and never stop trying to roll things back. If you look at the condition of the welfare state, voting rights, or recent recruitment among online antifeminists and the \u201calt-right\u201d, you\u2019ll see that they frequently succeed. Even those religious fundamentalists who are most convinced of the looming apocalypse are rarely so complacent as to leave anything to history. Despite all this, Trudeau\u2019s remark seemed to create as much excitement on the liberal left as the diversity he had implemented. Perhaps, despite everything modernity has taught us about the savagery that lurks just under the surface of even the most technologically advanced societies, or which is built into their structures, we want politicians to testify to their belief that human history has a singular, forward momentum. Perhaps liberals like Trudeau make us feel good in these moments of victory because they allow us to suspend our political disbelief. Maybe they allow us to think that stern conservatives like Trudeau\u2019s predecessor, Stephen Harper, are mere mistakes, wrong turns on the journey to a better tomorrow. In this mood, conservatives may appear as less the persistent, integral part of modernity that they are and more as a holdover from the past, which will soon pass. Will Trudeau-mania be one of those repeated episodes of misplaced relief, where we talk and act as if the forces of reaction have finally been consigned to the past, where we think they belong? If any of this is true, it may explain the dream run that Malcolm Turnbull is having in Australia at the moment. Just as Trudeau rubbed out Harper, Turnbull consigned Harper\u2019s bosom pal, Tony Abbott, to political oblivion. By shifting the tone of the political discussion, through a difference in emphasis, and by virtue of being considerably less rigid and strange, Turnbull has won over the vast majority of the Australian people, including large elements of the liberal left. Like Trudeau, and unlike the men they respectively replaced, Turnbull has the air of someone who lives in the present and is oriented to the future. He also appears to have learned Trudeau\u2019s knack of wearing his privilege relatively lightly. In the way both speak and act they seem to offer the promise that the curtains will be drawn to admit the light of the future: technology, secularism, equality. Relief at the demise of Abbott has shaded into optimism about Turnbull. The problem is that for now, it\u2019s completely groundless. Whatever we might say about Trudeau\u2019s theory of history, he has at least delivered a cabinet filled with women, indigenous Canadians, and some who arrived as migrants or refugees. It may be easy to get too carried away with the prospects of top down reform, but Trudeau has made decisions to ensure that the government approximates the country\u2019s demographic diversity. Turnbull, so far, has received a lot of credit and political capital for running a government that looks pretty similar to the last one. We\u2019ve been given a striking reminder by our Commonwealth cousins that our rulers are overwhelming old, white and male. Neither has he done much to shift its emphasis or its agenda. And time is marching on. Perhaps he\u2019s being careful, but perhaps that\u2019s another way of saying that he will always be forced to work within the constraints set for him by his party\u2019s right. There\u2019s no reason that 2015, or any other year, is obliged to reflect a particular set of political values. Justin Trudeau was able to make changes because he handed conservatives a political defeat. If Malcolm Turnbull doesn\u2019t start moving soon, we\u2019ll be entitled to wonder whether he really prevailed over the conservatives in his midst at all.",

Before launching his political career \u2013 he was first elected in 2008 \u2013 Garneau logged over 675 hours in space on Space Shuttle missions in 1984, 1996, and 2000. But Garneau is not the only member of Justin Trudeau\u2019s cabinet \u2013 the first in the country\u2019s history to have equal numbers of men and women \u2013 to have made history.

          "bodyText": "Canada\u2019s new prime minister Justin Trudeau has named a young and ethnically diverse cabinet, with a ministerial team that for the first time in the country\u2019s history is equally balanced between men and women. The ministers \u2013 15 women and 15 men \u2013 are mostly aged under 50, in a team marking both a generational change and a commitment to reflecting Canada\u2019s diversity. \u201cIt\u2019s important to be here before you today to present to Canada a cabinet that looks like Canada,\u201d Trudeau, 43, told reporters on Wednesday soon after he was officially sworn-in as the country\u2019s 23rd prime minister \u2013 the second-youngest in its history. Asked to explain his gender parity promise, he answered: \u201cBecause it\u2019s 2015.\u201d Many of the incoming female ministers have been given key roles, including former journalist Chrystia Freeland \u2013 now in charge of international trade \u2013 and Maryam Monsef, who fled Afghanistan as a refugee 20 years ago and will oversee the democratic reform portfolio. Trudeau\u2019s cabinet also includes two aboriginal members of parliament and three Sikh politicians. But the prime minister also included some of the Liberal party\u2019s old guard, putting former party leader St\u00e9phane Dion in foreign affairs and giving one of his closest advisers, MP Dominic LeBlanc, the role of government leader in the House of Commons. Trudeau is the son of Pierre Elliott Trudeau, one of Canada\u2019s most recognizable and longest serving prime ministers. But he said he wasn\u2019t reflecting on his father\u2019s legacy during Wednesday\u2019s swearing-in. \u201cMy thoughts today \u2013 sorry Dad \u2013 aren\u2019t mostly on him, they\u2019re very much on my own kids and the kids across this country that we are going to work very, very hard for to ensure they have a better future,\u201d he said. An MP since 2008, Trudeau led the centrist Liberals to a resounding victory in October\u2019s federal election, replacing Stephen Harper\u2019s Conservatives, who held power for nine years. The mandate gives him the opportunity to undo some of the former prime minister\u2019s record, including amending sections of controversial anti-terror legislation and pulling Canadian forces out of the US-led coalition against Islamic State. In a dig at his predecessor, Trudeau promised cabinet members would have significant independence with their files. \u201cGovernment by cabinet is back,\u201d he said. Harper was known for centralizing power around the prime minister\u2019s office during his tenure and dominating the policy decisions being implemented by his own ministers. Trudeau had repeatedly promised his government would be more open and transparent than the previous one. That promise extended to Wednesday\u2019s swearing-in, as hundreds of people took up the Liberals\u2019 open invitation to watch the ceremony on large screens set up on the grounds of Rideau Hall. Eschewing the customary black cars that carry soon-to-be ministers to the doors of the official residence of Canada\u2019s governor-general, Trudeau and his family and the new cabinet arrived on the grounds in a bus. Trudeau later greeted the crowds and took selfies with fans lining the long driveway to the entrance of the governor general\u2019s official residence. During the ceremony, cheers from the crowd came in support of some of his cabinet picks, including for new justice minister Jody Wilson Raybould, a former Crown prosecutor and First Nations leader from British Columbia. The portfolios of a number of newly appointed cabinet ministers will demand immediate attention as the Liberals push to quickly follow through on their campaign commitments. Immigration minister John McCallum will oversee the Liberal campaign promise to bring 25,000 Syrian refugees into Canada by the end of this year. Catherine McKenna, a lawyer by training, will join Trudeau in Paris at the end of the month for the COP 21 conference as the new minister of environment and climate change. And indigenous affairs minister Carolyn Bennett, a longtime Liberal MP who has worked extensively on First Nations issues, will oversee the implementation of a national inquiry into the cases of hundreds of missing and murdered indigenous women.",

          "body": "<p>After almost a decade of deep-right conservatism, Canada\u2019s political landscape experienced a major shift on 19 October with a dramatic come-from-behind <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/oct/19/canada-election-justin-trudeau-stephen-harper\" title=\"\">national election win by Justin Trudeau\u2019s Liberal party</a>. Trudeau\u2019s Liberals started the 2015 campaign as the third party with only 36 seats and sprinted to a strong majority win with 184 seats \u2013 a novel electoral accomplishment in Canada.</p> <p>Unique, also, was how this was achieved. Trudeau\u2019s commitment to run modest deficits (of $10bn a year for three years) to stimulate the economy through infrastructure spending was a game-changer in the campaign. This was particularly so given aggressive attacks from his political opponents on both the left and right labelling the Liberal leader as fiscally irresponsible.</p> <p>While Canada is hitting the pause button on austerity, the UK chancellor, is on fast-forward. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jul/21/spending-review-george-osborne-20bn-savings-clear-deficit\" title=\"\">George Osborne\u2019s 2015 spending review will see a further \u00a320bn cut from public spending </a>to achieve balance by 2019, a move which follows a halving of the deficit over the course of the last parliament. Heavyweight economic commentators are coalescing around the view that with interest rates low and unemployment high it\u2019s the right time to invest in public programs and infrastructure. Even the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/19/imf-uk-boost-spending-save-economy\" title=\"\"> International Monetary Fund says it\u2019s time to open the taps of government spending</a>. Trudeau caught the wave.</p> <p>Canada is no stranger to austerity. The Chretien Liberal government in the 1990s saw finance minister Paul Martin wrestle down massive deficits and the size of the federal public service. The hallmark of Martin\u2019s strategy though was the rejection of across-the-board spending cuts in favour of an evaluation of the relative importance of programmes and services within the fiscal plan. Privatisation and contracting out were in the mix but used sparingly. In 2010, Martin, having retired from politics, was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/jan/13/paul-martin-budget-deficit-trailblazer\" title=\"\">consulted by some European leaders and the then Tory opposition in Britain for advice on some non-inflammatory approaches to deficit cutting</a>, but it is unclear whether his messages had much impact. Austerity under the ousted Conservative government led by Stephen Harper came in the form of a smaller role for the state partly by stepping back from major policy spheres such as public pensions, health, aboriginal policy and climate change. Alongside this, deep tax cuts, including spousal income-splitting and new child benefits all targeted towards wealthy Canadians, in combination with the mantra of balanced budgets, had the desired impact of shrinking available revenues in other programme areas.</p> <p>What can we expect from Trudeau? An increased focus on social policy is expected, with aboriginal issues and income inequality back on the table. There has been an immediate shift from the intensely command-and-control style of the Harper government, starting with much more access for the media and a collaborative approach to working with provincial political leaders. Regional leaders now find themselves invited to join Trudeau in upcoming climate change talks in Paris. This would have been unthinkable under the Harper regime which had directed government tax auditors to target pro-environment charities.</p> <p>There will be some fresh air for a beleaguered public service too, which has seen its diplomatic corps and federal scientists placed under tight gagging orders. In an open letter to the public services, Trudeau said that unlike Harper, who saw public servants as an adversary, \u201cI see a partner. I believe that in order to have a public service that is valued by Canadians, and a source of pride for its members, it must be valued by its government. That begins with \u2013 and necessitates \u2013 respecting the labour rights of public servants, and trusting in their ability to provide effective, independent, and professional services for Canadians.\u201d</p> <p>We can also expect newly found political support for an ambitious, but nascent, public service reform agenda. Reports indicate the creation of several results teams organised around the PM\u2019s key prioritiesand modelled on delivery teams introduced in Ontario in 2003.These involved a balanced relationship between a central monitoring and challenge function, and line ministries, which maintained the lion\u2019s share of responsibility for delivery. It was highly successful in Ontario and is therefore a helpful incubator for the more challenging effort of driving results through a large and highly dispersed, dispirited, but likely hopeful, public service.</p>",

          "bodyText": "After almost a decade of deep-right conservatism, Canada\u2019s political landscape experienced a major shift on 19 October with a dramatic come-from-behind national election win by Justin Trudeau\u2019s Liberal party. Trudeau\u2019s Liberals started the 2015 campaign as the third party with only 36 seats and sprinted to a strong majority win with 184 seats \u2013 a novel electoral accomplishment in Canada. Unique, also, was how this was achieved. Trudeau\u2019s commitment to run modest deficits (of $10bn a year for three years) to stimulate the economy through infrastructure spending was a game-changer in the campaign. This was particularly so given aggressive attacks from his political opponents on both the left and right labelling the Liberal leader as fiscally irresponsible. While Canada is hitting the pause button on austerity, the UK chancellor, is on fast-forward. George Osborne\u2019s 2015 spending review will see a further \u00a320bn cut from public spending to achieve balance by 2019, a move which follows a halving of the deficit over the course of the last parliament. Heavyweight economic commentators are coalescing around the view that with interest rates low and unemployment high it\u2019s the right time to invest in public programs and infrastructure. Even the International Monetary Fund says it\u2019s time to open the taps of government spending. Trudeau caught the wave. Canada is no stranger to austerity. The Chretien Liberal government in the 1990s saw finance minister Paul Martin wrestle down massive deficits and the size of the federal public service. The hallmark of Martin\u2019s strategy though was the rejection of across-the-board spending cuts in favour of an evaluation of the relative importance of programmes and services within the fiscal plan. Privatisation and contracting out were in the mix but used sparingly. In 2010, Martin, having retired from politics, was consulted by some European leaders and the then Tory opposition in Britain for advice on some non-inflammatory approaches to deficit cutting, but it is unclear whether his messages had much impact. Austerity under the ousted Conservative government led by Stephen Harper came in the form of a smaller role for the state partly by stepping back from major policy spheres such as public pensions, health, aboriginal policy and climate change. Alongside this, deep tax cuts, including spousal income-splitting and new child benefits all targeted towards wealthy Canadians, in combination with the mantra of balanced budgets, had the desired impact of shrinking available revenues in other programme areas. What can we expect from Trudeau? An increased focus on social policy is expected, with aboriginal issues and income inequality back on the table. There has been an immediate shift from the intensely command-and-control style of the Harper government, starting with much more access for the media and a collaborative approach to working with provincial political leaders. Regional leaders now find themselves invited to join Trudeau in upcoming climate change talks in Paris. This would have been unthinkable under the Harper regime which had directed government tax auditors to target pro-environment charities. There will be some fresh air for a beleaguered public service too, which has seen its diplomatic corps and federal scientists placed under tight gagging orders. In an open letter to the public services, Trudeau said that unlike Harper, who saw public servants as an adversary, \u201cI see a partner. I believe that in order to have a public service that is valued by Canadians, and a source of pride for its members, it must be valued by its government. That begins with \u2013 and necessitates \u2013 respecting the labour rights of public servants, and trusting in their ability to provide effective, independent, and professional services for Canadians.\u201d We can also expect newly found political support for an ambitious, but nascent, public service reform agenda. Reports indicate the creation of several results teams organised around the PM\u2019s key prioritiesand modelled on delivery teams introduced in Ontario in 2003.These involved a balanced relationship between a central monitoring and challenge function, and line ministries, which maintained the lion\u2019s share of responsibility for delivery. It was highly successful in Ontario and is therefore a helpful incubator for the more challenging effort of driving results through a large and highly dispersed, dispirited, but likely hopeful, public service.",

          "bodyText": "Usually a spot for stuffy official receptions, one April evening of last year the official residence of Canadian prime ministers briefly turned into a teenager\u2019s party house. In the early hours, paramedics were called to 24 Sussex, following reports of a drunk teenage girl near the property\u2019s outside gate. She had allegedly taken ill after a pool party celebrating the 18th birthday of outgoing prime minister Stephen Harper\u2019s son, Ben. A terse media statement from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, in charge of protecting the prime minister and his family, confirmed only that it \u201cwas a medical call and not a police matter. It did not involve any of our protectees\u201d. It was still a rare glimpse for the public behind the curtains of the state-subsidized mansion on the bank of the Ottawa river, a place where Canadian heads of government raise their families and go home after a day at the office, as well as a heritage property used to host foreign dignitaries and the political elite. 24 Sussex was back in Canadian headlines this week after prime minister-designate Justin Trudeau \u2013 who spent his own childhood there as the son of former prime minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau \u2013 announced he will not move his family into the residence. The fact is, the property is a drafty wreck. A 2008 report from the federal auditor general tallied it needed some C$10m (about $7.5m) in extensive repairs that would take at least a year to complete \u2013 everything from cracked windows and caulking to failing air conditioning and \u201cdeficient\u201d plumbing. \u201cThe only element of the exterior at 24 Sussex that is in good condition is the roof,\u201d the government spending watchdog added. It was bad enough that some pundits urged the Harpers to vacate the building to allow for its refurbishment. Now, even low-tax advocacy groups like the Canadian Taxpayers Federation are on board with the Trudeaus allowing for the renovations to take place, as long as costs are reasonable and transparent. \u201cWe\u2019re not anarchists,\u201d Aaron Wudrick, the organization\u2019s federal director said. \u201cMost of us wouldn\u2019t move into a house that hasn\u2019t seen significant repairs for 50 years.\u201d The 24 Sussex renovation controversies that dogged another prime minister, former Tory leader Brian Mulroney, probably made Harper gun-shy about pulling the trigger on spending millions from the public purse for repairs during his time in office, Wudrick noted. If Canada\u2019s new Liberal government manages to keep the renovations tab in check, Trudeau will avoid the fate of other politicians and dignitaries who faced a sticker-shocked public fretting over cost of housing their leaders. Last November, the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, angered Turks and had opposition parties pouncing as the costs for the lavish new presidential palace \u2013 with 1,150 rooms spread over 3.1 million square feet (288,000 square metres) and reportedly filled with imported Italian trees \u2013 spiked to nearly twice its official estimate to $615m. Erdogan defended the spending, saying it was \u201cthe nation\u2019s palace\u201d, not his, and pointing to the costs of refurbishing Britain\u2019s Buckingham Palace. The cost of urgent repairs to that crumbling palace were recently estimated at \u00a3150m (about $229m). The Queen\u2019s London residence hasn\u2019t had a major refurbishment since the 1950s and she may be forced to move out during the overhaul. Those costs have led some to question why British taxpayers are on the hook for repairs and whether the royals should open the palace to the public more often to help pay the bills.

          "body": "<p>Turkey is a pivotal sort of place. A bridge between continents and cultures. A western ally perched on the edges of war, and now a major transit point for those fleeing conflict and strife. As international events swirl, the political focus is also very much on domestic affairs: issues such as security, economy and human rights. So an election this coming weekend is not only crucial \u2013 for Turks and for the international community \u2013 it is equally fascinating.</p> <p>Our cover this week considers the many factors in play before the ballots are cast and counted.</p> <p>Internationally, it felt like an all-election weekend, as voters in Poland, Guatemala and Tanzania, among others, went to the polls. On our international news pages we capture some of the results, which we will fill out as more detailed analysis is written.</p> <p>Following up on a federal election in Canada, meanwhile, that saw Liberal Justin Trudeau elected prime minister, the Guardian\u2019s executive editor of opinion, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/jonathanfreedland\" title=\"\">Jonathan Freedland</a>, provides some interesting reflections on the nature of dynasties.</p> <p>We bring you a page of coverage on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/libya\" title=\"\">Libya</a>, a failed state that\u2019s been a departure point for many in Europe\u2019s refugee crisis. Bringing stability is critical, and extremely difficult, as Guardian opinion writer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/yasmina-khadra\" title=\"\">Yasmina Khadra</a> and our partner paper the Washington Post write. Meanwhile, on the shores of Greece, the race is on for the displaced as winter draws closer and the Mediterranean passages become more deadly.</p> <p>On the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/environment\" title=\"\">environment</a> front, with a climate conference in Paris looming in late November, we give over two pages of coverage to solar energy in Morocco, the global \u201ccold crunch\u201d as cooling needs soar, and European greenhouse gas emissions. Not all of this is doom and gloom, I\u2019m happy to say. Watch in the weeks ahead for beefed up environment coverage.</p> <p>Elsewhere, presidential contender <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton\" title=\"\">Hillary Clinton</a> shines in an upbeat October and the British prime minister <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron\" title=\"\">David Cameron</a> finds plans for tax credit cuts thwarted by the House of Lords.</p> <p>After Chinese leader <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/xi-jinping\" title=\"\">Xi Jinping</a>\u2019s visit to Britain, we assess the economic value of the trip. We also take a look at the state of the Middle Kingdom\u2019s economy after the People\u2019s Bank of China lowered interest rates, yet again.</p> <p>The rise of technology is a theme throughout the edition. In our World roundup experts sound an alarm on stupid \u2018AI\u2019, on our UK pages a teenager is arrested in connection with a cyber-attack on UK telecom TalkTalk, and on the Comment pages Paul Mason warns of allowing tech giants to rule our emerging smart cities.

          "bodyText": "Turkey is a pivotal sort of place. A bridge between continents and cultures. A western ally perched on the edges of war, and now a major transit point for those fleeing conflict and strife. As international events swirl, the political focus is also very much on domestic affairs: issues such as security, economy and human rights. So an election this coming weekend is not only crucial \u2013 for Turks and for the international community \u2013 it is equally fascinating. Our cover this week considers the many factors in play before the ballots are cast and counted. Internationally, it felt like an all-election weekend, as voters in Poland, Guatemala and Tanzania, among others, went to the polls. On our international news pages we capture some of the results, which we will fill out as more detailed analysis is written. Following up on a federal election in Canada, meanwhile, that saw Liberal Justin Trudeau elected prime minister, the Guardian\u2019s executive editor of opinion, Jonathan Freedland, provides some interesting reflections on the nature of dynasties. We bring you a page of coverage on Libya, a failed state that\u2019s been a departure point for many in Europe\u2019s refugee crisis. Bringing stability is critical, and extremely difficult, as Guardian opinion writer Yasmina Khadra and our partner paper the Washington Post write. Meanwhile, on the shores of Greece, the race is on for the displaced as winter draws closer and the Mediterranean passages become more deadly. On the environment front, with a climate conference in Paris looming in late November, we give over two pages of coverage to solar energy in Morocco, the global \u201ccold crunch\u201d as cooling needs soar, and European greenhouse gas emissions. Not all of this is doom and gloom, I\u2019m happy to say. Watch in the weeks ahead for beefed up environment coverage. Elsewhere, presidential contender Hillary Clinton shines in an upbeat October and the British prime minister David Cameron finds plans for tax credit cuts thwarted by the House of Lords. After Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s visit to Britain, we assess the economic value of the trip. We also take a look at the state of the Middle Kingdom\u2019s economy after the People\u2019s Bank of China lowered interest rates, yet again. The rise of technology is a theme throughout the edition. In our World roundup experts sound an alarm on stupid \u2018AI\u2019, on our UK pages a teenager is arrested in connection with a cyber-attack on UK telecom TalkTalk, and on the Comment pages Paul Mason warns of allowing tech giants to rule our emerging smart cities. The books pages rounds things off, reviewing a book that questions whether mobile technology is destroying our ability to communicate. Technology can\u2019t be ignored. But can it be so readily, easily embraced? Something to consider. On our letters page, you shared views on trade, Middle East politics, North American divides and procrastination (something I can be rather good at!). Ready for a deeper read?

          "body": "<h2><strong>Toward the next intifada</strong><br></h2> <p>I found Peter Beaumont\u2019s piece <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/10/israel-palestinians-violence-fears\" title=\"\">(Dark clouds form over Israel and Palestine, 16&#xa0;October)</a> very insightful. I hope that recent events in the Israeli occupied West Bank have awakened more people to what\u2019s really going on in Palestine and have helped them to see who are the oppressors and who are the oppressed in this situation. And that this will embolden more people to speak up and do something to help and support the Palestinian people. Because Palestinians have already suffered far too much, for far too long, the loss of their homeland, displacement, ethnic cleansing, dispossession, cruel abuses, atrocities and hundreds of thousands of deaths.</p> <p>The west cannot remain indifferent to the plight of the Palestinian people and be silent because Jews were persecuted by others during the second world war. Why must Palestinians continue to pay the terrible price for this past tragedy, which was nothing to do with them? An injustice committed against one people does not justify an injustice inflicted against another people. Without justice, respect and the restoration of Palestinian rights there will be no real peace in Palestine. Let\u2019s not ignore cruel repression or allow the maiming and deaths of thousands more Palestinian children, women and men to go unnoticed and without doing something to stop this gross mistreatment. <br><strong>Steven Katsineris</strong><br>Hurstbridge, Victoria, Australia</p> <p>\u2022 If young girls \u201cjoining in clashes\u201d with Israelis are wearing keffiyehs to hide their identities, then the Guardian isn\u2019t doing them any favours by publishing a photograph of a girl who I would instantly recognise as my daughter if I were her mother. Or do all almond-eyed women wearing a head covering look the same?</p> <p>And why, then, are the boys wearing keffiyehs as well? The reason is that they help protect from the teargas systematically fired by Israeli soldiers in any situation they construe as threatening.</p> <p>This may seem a trivial point given the horrors of what\u2019s going on, but it\u2019s the kind of toxic detail \u2013 suggesting that Arab girls are afraid of their parents \u2013that spreads biased perceptions about human beings involved in any conflict. And quoting the opinion that these girls are acting out of \u201cromantic\u201d ideas doesn\u2019t help: were the women resisting occupation in the second world war being \u201cromantic\u201d? And how would they be feeling now, if that occupation were still in place 60 years on?<br><strong>Ilona Bossanyi</strong><br>St Sardos, France</p> <h2><strong>TPP, business and democracy</strong><br></h2> <p>Thank you for allowing Brenda the Civil Disobedience Penguin to explain the Trans-Pacific Partnership (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/picture/2015/oct/07/the-trans-pacific-partnership-will-shut-down-all-your-kitten-hospitals\" title=\"\">First Dog on the Moon, 16&#xa0;October</a>). Whereas one can understand the need for industrial and technical standards between countries to be harmonised, thus promoting better trade relationships, it does seem the agreements currently under discussion go far beyond mere technicalities. Thus the TTP and its big brother, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, seem set to undermine the democratic processes of nations concerned. This surely cannot be right. We must be on our guard to ensure that, to paraphrase Abraham Lincoln: government of the people, by big business, for big business, shall not be allowed to take over the world.<br><strong>Derek Malpass</strong><br>Hohenthann, Germany</p> <h2><strong>Dawkins\u2019s human failings</strong><br></h2> <p>With attention brought to Richard Dawkins in particular and atheists in general, the review of Dawkins\u2019s book, Brief Candle in the Dark <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/26/brief-candle-in-the-dark-richard-dawkins-science-review\" title=\"\">(2&#xa0;October)</a> may be the crack in the door to attract balanced comments from the silent throngs of people who understand what the gaping hole in Dawkins\u2019s life is and how he can be a challenging scientist to other scientists but has next to nothing to offer people in general.</p> <p>With his well-developed intellect he has produced theories and books but neither the ideas nor the books address the matrix of his humanness within which they were created: feelings, emotions, intuition, spirit and inner truth. The Unknown has been squeezed out completely! The Tao symbol, a circle divided with a gently s-shaped line into equal halves, symbolises life and its pairs of opposites that we work, play and create with every day of our lives.<br><strong>Mary MacMakin</strong><br>Kabul, Afghanistan</p> <h2><strong>US and campaign financing</strong><br></h2> <p>I wonder if Timothy Garton Ash has been in hibernation, given how out-of-date and limited his comments on campaign financing were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/01/us-presidential-election-america-damaged-democracy-campaign-spending\" title=\"\">(9&#xa0;October)</a>. He missed the bigger picture: that one of the key problems holding the US back is the wilful misreading of its own constitution. This produces not only the idiotic Citizens United decision, but also the crazy political stance on unrestricted personal access to guns.</p> <p>I don\u2019t doubt that scheming politicians are trying to find \u201cbendable\u201d phrases in the constitution that will help to abort any action on climate change or the mass extinction of fauna and flora that is under way.</p> <p>The supreme court reflects the biases and lack of foresight of the presidents who appointed them. One answer to the question at the top of the article is: the US will repair its damaged democracy only when the present supreme court is replaced by a sensible group of thinkers with human perspective.</p> <p>I doubt Churchill would still make the optimistic remark about America doing the right thing. Instead he might say \u201cWorld: don\u2019t hold your breath\u201d.<br><strong>David Hinkley</strong><br>Santa Barbara, California, US</p> <h2><strong>Canada doesn\u2019t need a wall</strong><br></h2> <p>Canada doesn\u2019t need to build a wall along its border with the United States <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/10/09/the-extreme-lengths-canadians-will-go-to-keep-americans-out/\" title=\"\">(16 October)</a>. One exists already \u2013 the wall of indifference.</p> <p>Americans, for example, are far more interested at the moment in Donald Trump and its own coming election than they were in ours, which resulted in the young and attractive Liberal Justin Trudeau being elected prime minister by a vast majority, after the long 10-year reign of staid Conservative Stephen Harper.</p> <p>Perhaps now with the re-emergence of the Trudeau name, which harks back to the heady era from the 60s, 70s, and early 80s, with all its pizzazz and glamour, American indifference may change to perhaps a passing squint.<br><strong>Richard Orlando</strong><br>Westmount, Quebec, Canada</p> <h2><strong>Saving the Cornish language</strong><br></h2> <p>I read Jessica Elgot\u2019s recent article Pride of Piran <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/oct/07/cornwall-council-plans-to-encourage-staff-to-speak-cornish\" title=\"\">(23 October)</a>, about efforts to preserve and promote the Cornish language. Here in Australia minority languages have withered and died at a rate that rivals, I would guess, that of animal species\u2019 extinction. Six extinct Aboriginal languages are listed on a single page of my Australian Oxford Dictionary.</p> <p>Let me suggest two practical solutions. First, call global tenders for Cornish call-centre contracts. Within a year there will be hundreds of Cornish speakers in India, the Philippines and other countries that specialise in this service. Second, establish a special immigration quota for which applicants must pass a written and oral examination in Cornish.<br><strong>John Standingford</strong><br>Adelaide, South Australia</p> <h2><strong>Hope for humanity yet</strong><br></h2> <p>I read Oliver Burkeman\u2019s columns before meeting him recently at my son\u2019s wedding in upstate New York. His <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/sep/18/are-machines-making-humans-obsolete\" title=\"\">review of Geoff Colvin\u2019s book</a> Humans are Underrated (9 October), about things we should never yield to computers, reaffirms my loyalty.</p> <p>Burkeman rightly agrees with the author that cheek-by-jowl contact between judge and accused, therapist and patient, teacher and student, is irreplaceable. But does being beaten down by the meaninglessness of existence preclude striving for greater humanness? If so, why? If we\u2019re certain of defeat, why resist the beating? Why don\u2019t we jaded adults emulate our children\u2019s hopefulness? Must there be a point when we give up fighting to become more human?</p> <p>Weddings and other feasts with the friendly give hope all is not relinquished to computer technology.<br><strong>Gerald Mikkelson</strong><br>Lawrence, Kansas, US</p> <p>\u2022 The juxtaposition of Oliver Burkeman\u2019s musings on human redundancy in the jobs market with the Shortcut <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/28/no-sex-with-robots-says-japanese-android-firm-softbank\" title=\"\">Humans told not to have sex with robots</a> (9 October) suggests that at least the oldest profession will continue to provide job security in the future.<br><strong>Kirsten King</strong><br>Cologna Veneta, Italy</p> <h2><strong>Briefly</strong><br></h2> <p>\u2022 Procrastination is indeed a waste of time <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/06/procrastination-waste-time-work-facebook\" title=\"\">(16 October)</a>.

Ilona Bossanyi St Sardos, France TPP, business and democracy Thank you for allowing Brenda the Civil Disobedience Penguin to explain the Trans-Pacific Partnership (First Dog on the Moon, 16 October). Whereas one can understand the need for industrial and technical standards between countries to be harmonised, thus promoting better trade relationships, it does seem the agreements currently under discussion go far beyond mere technicalities. Thus the TTP and its big brother, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, seem set to undermine the democratic processes of nations concerned. This surely cannot be right. We must be on our guard to ensure that, to paraphrase Abraham Lincoln: government of the people, by big business, for big business, shall not be allowed to take over the world. Derek Malpass Hohenthann, Germany Dawkins\u2019s human failings With attention brought to Richard Dawkins in particular and atheists in general, the review of Dawkins\u2019s book, Brief Candle in the Dark (2 October) may be the crack in the door to attract balanced comments from the silent throngs of people who understand what the gaping hole in Dawkins\u2019s life is and how he can be a challenging scientist to other scientists but has next to nothing to offer people in general. With his well-developed intellect he has produced theories and books but neither the ideas nor the books address the matrix of his humanness within which they were created: feelings, emotions, intuition, spirit and inner truth. The Unknown has been squeezed out completely! The Tao symbol, a circle divided with a gently s-shaped line into equal halves, symbolises life and its pairs of opposites that we work, play and create with every day of our lives. Mary MacMakin Kabul, Afghanistan US and campaign financing I wonder if Timothy Garton Ash has been in hibernation, given how out-of-date and limited his comments on campaign financing were (9 October). He missed the bigger picture: that one of the key problems holding the US back is the wilful misreading of its own constitution. This produces not only the idiotic Citizens United decision, but also the crazy political stance on unrestricted personal access to guns. I don\u2019t doubt that scheming politicians are trying to find \u201cbendable\u201d phrases in the constitution that will help to abort any action on climate change or the mass extinction of fauna and flora that is under way. The supreme court reflects the biases and lack of foresight of the presidents who appointed them. One answer to the question at the top of the article is: the US will repair its damaged democracy only when the present supreme court is replaced by a sensible group of thinkers with human perspective. I doubt Churchill would still make the optimistic remark about America doing the right thing. Instead he might say \u201cWorld: don\u2019t hold your breath\u201d. David Hinkley Santa Barbara, California, US Canada doesn\u2019t need a wall Canada doesn\u2019t need to build a wall along its border with the United States (16 October). One exists already \u2013 the wall of indifference. Americans, for example, are far more interested at the moment in Donald Trump and its own coming election than they were in ours, which resulted in the young and attractive Liberal Justin Trudeau being elected prime minister by a vast majority, after the long 10-year reign of staid Conservative Stephen Harper. Perhaps now with the re-emergence of the Trudeau name, which harks back to the heady era from the 60s, 70s, and early 80s, with all its pizzazz and glamour, American indifference may change to perhaps a passing squint. Richard Orlando Westmount, Quebec, Canada Saving the Cornish language I read Jessica Elgot\u2019s recent article Pride of Piran (23 October), about efforts to preserve and promote the Cornish language. Here in Australia minority languages have withered and died at a rate that rivals, I would guess, that of animal species\u2019 extinction. Six extinct Aboriginal languages are listed on a single page of my Australian Oxford Dictionary. Let me suggest two practical solutions. First, call global tenders for Cornish call-centre contracts. Within a year there will be hundreds of Cornish speakers in India, the Philippines and other countries that specialise in this service. Second, establish a special immigration quota for which applicants must pass a written and oral examination in Cornish. John Standingford Adelaide, South Australia Hope for humanity yet I read Oliver Burkeman\u2019s columns before meeting him recently at my son\u2019s wedding in upstate New York. His review of Geoff Colvin\u2019s book Humans are Underrated (9 October), about things we should never yield to computers, reaffirms my loyalty. Burkeman rightly agrees with the author that cheek-by-jowl contact between judge and accused, therapist and patient, teacher and student, is irreplaceable. But does being beaten down by the meaninglessness of existence preclude striving for greater humanness? If so, why? If we\u2019re certain of defeat, why resist the beating? Why don\u2019t we jaded adults emulate our children\u2019s hopefulness? Must there be a point when we give up fighting to become more human? Weddings and other feasts with the friendly give hope all is not relinquished to computer technology. Gerald Mikkelson Lawrence, Kansas, US \u2022 The juxtaposition of Oliver Burkeman\u2019s musings on human redundancy in the jobs market with the Shortcut Humans told not to have sex with robots (9 October) suggests that at least the oldest profession will continue to provide job security in the future. Kirsten King Cologna Veneta, Italy Briefly \u2022 Procrastination is indeed a waste of time (16 October). It\u2019s called Parkinson\u2019s Law: \u201cWork expands so as to fill the time available for its completion\u2019\u2019 (1955). Priscilla Trench London, UK \u2022 Your article about small snails found in China with shells only 0.86mm high (9 October) suggests that 10 of them could fit in the eye of a needle. At 8.6mm that eye, although not large enough for a camel, would be quite sizeable. Did you mean a bodkin?

          "body": "<p>There can be little doubt which political party will win Sunday\u2019s general election in Poland. Even if, due to arcane coalition machinations, it is unable to form a government, the Law and Justice party (PiS) looks certain to emerge as the largest single parliamentary group.<a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/10/22/us-poland-election-coalition-idUSKCN0SG24Z20151022\" title=\"\"> Pre-election polls </a>gave it a lead of up to 14 points over its nearest rival, the ruling Civic Platform. By any measure, PiS won the argument, and the campaign, and it will be odd if it is denied power.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>A Poland under PiS could make all of Europe\u2019s myriad problems look just that much more difficult to solve</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For a watching, apprehensive Europe, the vagaries of Poland\u2019s system of representative democracy are not the salient issue. The issue is what PiS and its eminence grise, the former prime minister, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2013/08/05/world/europe/06POLAND.html\" title=\"\">Jaroslaw Kaczynski</a>, appear to stand for: a divisive Euroscepticism, pugilistic nationalism, anti-migrant populism, old-school statist economics, Russophobia and alleged fiscal irresponsibility. A Poland under PiS could make Europe\u2019s myriad problems look just that much more difficult to solve.</p> <p>Yet it would be both harsh and foolish to pin the blame for such a worrying prospective regression on Polish shoulders alone.

          "bodyText": "There can be little doubt which political party will win Sunday\u2019s general election in Poland. Even if, due to arcane coalition machinations, it is unable to form a government, the Law and Justice party (PiS) looks certain to emerge as the largest single parliamentary group. Pre-election polls gave it a lead of up to 14 points over its nearest rival, the ruling Civic Platform. By any measure, PiS won the argument, and the campaign, and it will be odd if it is denied power. For a watching, apprehensive Europe, the vagaries of Poland\u2019s system of representative democracy are not the salient issue. The issue is what PiS and its eminence grise, the former prime minister, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, appear to stand for: a divisive Euroscepticism, pugilistic nationalism, anti-migrant populism, old-school statist economics, Russophobia and alleged fiscal irresponsibility. A Poland under PiS could make Europe\u2019s myriad problems look just that much more difficult to solve. Yet it would be both harsh and foolish to pin the blame for such a worrying prospective regression on Polish shoulders alone. In the wake of the global financial slump, after the near meltdown of the eurozone and the Greek financial crisis, after years of punishing austerity (which Poles largely escaped) and in the midst of the biggest inward migration surge in living memory, Polish voters are merely the latest electorate to face the watershed choice that is confronting Europe as a whole. It is a choice between steady adherence to the progressively democratic, consensual, socially responsible and inclusive values ostensibly embodied in the EU and a descent into polarising tribalism in international affairs, societal introspection and xenophobia at home, and intolerant, hard-right, hard-left political warfare. Looked at another way, it is a choice between Europe\u2019s 20th-century past and what could and should be its 21st-century future.

It\u2019s not something that really interests him.

Their budget bill will include an increase childcare benefits for the poor and middle-income Canadian families.<br></p> <p>But details remain vague on how a number of other promises \u2013 a reformed Canadian senate, legalized marijuana \u2013 will be implemented.<br></p> <p>The party says further details will come when Trudeau and his new cabinet are sworn in on 4 November. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b19357871766ab84f3ff5265d2b16aa64a74be0f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b19357871766ab84f3ff5265d2b16aa64a74be0f/0_93_4376_2625/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Liberal leader Justin Trudeau family\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Liberal leader, Justin Trudeau, watches election night coverage with his mother Margaret Trudeau, from left, his wife Sophie, daughter Ella Grace and sons Hadrien (foreground) and Xavier, right.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Wattie/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Freeland said everyone in the party is feeling of the weight of expectations.</p> <p>\u201cI feel very acutely myself, I know Trudeau feels this and everyone on the team feels this, an intense and a heavy sense of responsibility,\u201d she said.</p> <h2>The Trudeau file</h2> <p><strong>Born:</strong> Justin Pierre James Trudeau, 25 December 1971, in Ottawa. His father, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, served as Canada\u2019s prime minister from 1968 to 1979 and again from 1980 to 1984.

His body was never recovered and Trudeau has linked Michel\u2019s death to his father\u2019s subsequent decline in health.<br></p> <p><strong>What he says:</strong> \u201cSo much of politics is fleeting and ephemeral. But the connections you make with the people who invest their hope and trust in you, that\u2019s what gets you through all of the rest. That\u2019s what makes it worth doing.\u201d</p> <p><strong>What others say: </strong> \u201cTrudeau probably reads more than any other politician I know. And yet you wouldn\u2019t know this from the way he talks about ideas: his boyish, eager-to-please personality leads him to project publicly in a way that can seem intellectually unsophisticated. Political oratory always sounds best when it\u2019s relaxed and natural. Trudeau\u2019s hyperactive personality makes that a difficult act for him to pull off.\u201d \u2013 Canadian journalist and editor-in-chief of the Walrus magazine Jonathan Kay. </p>",

          "bodyText": "Just a few months ago, it seemed that Canada\u2019s Liberal party, and its leader, Justin Trudeau, were facing a bleak future. The party was trailing third in opinion polls after backing unpopular new anti-terror legislation introduced by the governing Conservatives and it risked being outflanked on the left by the insurgent New Democratic party. After a relentless campaign of Conservative attack adverts saying that he was \u201cjust not ready\u201d for government, the leader was struggling to shake off the perception that he was a floppy-haired dauphin with no real political experience. As a federal election loomed, it seemed that the son of one of Canada\u2019s most famous and influential prime ministers was set to lead the party which has long seen itself as Canada\u2019s \u201cnatural governing party\u201d into political irrelevance. This week, however, Trudeau led the Liberals to a stunning federal election victory, sweeping 184 of 338 seats in Canada\u2019s House of Commons and driving the Conservatives out of government after nearly a decade in power. Finally, it seemed, this was dynastic politics you could believe in. It was the apparent fulfillment of destiny for Trudeau \u2013 but one he seemed at times to approach warily. His father, Pierre Trudeau, was Canada\u2019s most intellectual and flamboyant politician, who modernised laws on divorce, homosexuality and abortion, and was responsible for some of the country\u2019s landmark legislation, including its Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Justin Trudeau spent much of his childhood at 24 Sussex - the official residence of Canadian prime ministers \u2013 and it is hard to pinpoint a time in his life when someone wasn\u2019t trying to anoint him as the country\u2019s future leader. He was just four months old when in 1972 the then US president Richard Nixon toasted him as \u201cthe future prime minister of Canada\u201d. In 2000 he delivered an emotional eulogy at the state funeral of his father, former prime minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau, before an audience that included Fidel Castro and Jimmy Carter. The address spoke both to the memory of a beloved father, and to the future of the country \u2013 and immediately stoked speculation over the younger Trudeau\u2019s future political ambitions. But despite those early years on the periphery of power, he was largely unschooled in the nuts and bolts of statecraft when he launched his own political career. Alex Lanthier, Trudeau\u2019s campaign manager on his successfully runs for election as an MP in Montreal in 2008 and 2011, was surprised when the neophyte politician was stumped by a standard briefing book. \u201cHe said: \u2018So imagine I\u2019ve never seen one of these \u2013 what do I do with it?\u201d Lanthier said. \u201cPeople thought because of his upbringing he knew everything about politics.\u201d Lanthier told the newcomer that he would only work with Trudeau if he committed to the grind of old-fashioned, shoe-leather politics. \u201cHe didn\u2019t flinch. He said: \u2018I can do this, I want to connect,\u2019\u201d Lanthier said. Under Lanthier\u2019s watch, Trudeau spent the next year and a half knocking on thousands of doors in central Montreal and attending up to 10 community events each week. The former prime minister\u2019s son soon showed an innate ability to connect with people, though he initially was awkward and shy with crowds, said Lanthier, now a senior adviser with lobbying firm Summa Strategies. He also started a tradition of greeting constituents the morning after each election \u2013 one he carried over after Monday\u2019s national win and he appeared at a Montreal metro station to snap selfies with morning commuters. In 2012, aged 40 and member of parliament, Trudeau won a charity boxing match against a Conservative senator in a hotel ballroom filled with Ottawa politicians \u2013 an upset victory that came less than a year after the Liberals went down an historic federal election defeat. It was just the kind of technical knockout against a political rival that bruised Liberals needed, and one that kickstarted serious buzz around his potential. After winning the leadership in 2013, Trudeau oversaw an root-and-branch overhaul of the Liberal ground game, developing a platform, rebooting its fundraising ability and recruiting talented candidates after three successive electoral defeats. The party also consulted with veterans of President Obama\u2019s US campaigns on how to use data to identify voters and recruit volunteers. They credit that army of volunteers for nearly 12 million door knocks and phone calls the party says they managed over the course of the 11-week election campaign. Monday\u2019s vote was largely seen as a referendum on the the nine-year government of the Conservative Stephen Harper, and the Liberals were also boosted by the collapse of their sometimes allies sometimes rivals in the leftwing New Democratic party. But according to senior Trudeau adviser Robert Asselin, the Liberal victory also owed much to the figure of Trudeau himself, both his personal charisma and his policy platform with an emphasis on retail politics. Canada\u2019s hope Canadian journalist Jonathan Kay, who worked as an editorial assistant on Trudeau\u2019s recent memoir, Common Ground, said comparisons between the Canadian leader and Obama are not inaccurate.

And like Obama, Kay foresees Trudeau struggling with the disappointment from voters that dogged the president\u2019s administration in his first term in office as he faced the challenge of high expectations. The Liberal leader\u2019s achilles heel is that \u201che is morbidly afraid of disappointing people,\u201d said Kay. \u201cIt\u2019s a dangerous quality in a politician.\u201d Progressive Canadian voters in particular could be disillusioned by his support for international trade deals and the controversial Alberta-to-Texas Keystone XL pipeline project.

Certainly, Trudeau has not seemed wary of the limelight: he is happy to mug for cameras and pose with his wife, Sophie Gr\u00e9goire, a Quebec TV and radio personality with whom he has three young children and who appears to enjoy the attention as much as her husband. \u201cHe told me it\u2019s a real problem to create boundaries,\u201d said Kay, recalling a story Trudeau told him about taking his wife out to a romantic dinner in Ottawa, only to have it interrupted by a supporter who eventually tried to join them at their table. \u201cWith Trudeau, there\u2019s this sense he\u2019s so completely and constantly extroverted, it\u2019s almost like there are no boundaries,\u201d he said. Trudeau has given critics further ammunition with a series of flippant public remarks. At a conference at an Ottawa thinktank, he joked about Harper\u2019s decision to join the US-led combat mission in Iraq, saying Canada shouldn\u2019t \u201ctrying to whip out our CF-18s [fighter jets] and show them how big they are\u201d. At another event, asked about which nation\u2019s governance he admired, he responded: \u201cThere\u2019s a level of admiration I actually have for China because their basic dictatorship is allowing them to actually turn their economy around on a dime.\u201d Kay said that Trudeau has suffered from unfair comparisons with his father\u2019s fierce intellect, but he said: \u201cIt is quite true that if someone like [Vladimir] Putin or Angela Merkel or any of the dozens of different leaders were with Trudeau, he would probably be the least cosmopolitan person in the room, he would be the least savvy in terms of great affairs of state. It\u2019s not something that really interests him. I could see him largely leaving that to the professional diplomatic corps.\u201d One issue that does resonate with Trudeau is income inequality. Party insiders say the Liberal policies that directly bear his fingerprints are those related to public infrastructure spending and Canada\u2019s struggling middle class. \u201cJustin is really committed to acting on this issue,\u201d said newly re-elected Liberal MP Chrystia Freeland, a former journalist who was courted by Trudeau to run for the party after he read her book on the growing income gap. The first bill the Liberals plan to introduce in parliament will fulfill their promise to cut taxes for the middle class and to raise it for the wealthiest Canadians. Their budget bill will include an increase childcare benefits for the poor and middle-income Canadian families. But details remain vague on how a number of other promises \u2013 a reformed Canadian senate, legalized marijuana \u2013 will be implemented. The party says further details will come when Trudeau and his new cabinet are sworn in on 4 November. Freeland said everyone in the party is feeling of the weight of expectations. \u201cI feel very acutely myself, I know Trudeau feels this and everyone on the team feels this, an intense and a heavy sense of responsibility,\u201d she said. The Trudeau file Born: Justin Pierre James Trudeau, 25 December 1971, in Ottawa. His father, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, served as Canada\u2019s prime minister from 1968 to 1979 and again from 1980 to 1984. His mother, Margaret, is now an author and advocate for people struggling with mental illness. Trudeau is a schoolteacher by training and has worked an advocate for youth and environmental issues. Best of times: This Monday, shepherding the Liberals to a majority federal election win in a historic turnaround that swept the party from third place into power. Worst of times: In 1998, when his younger brother Michel died in an avalanche while back-country skiing in British Columbia. His body was never recovered and Trudeau has linked Michel\u2019s death to his father\u2019s subsequent decline in health. What he says: \u201cSo much of politics is fleeting and ephemeral. But the connections you make with the people who invest their hope and trust in you, that\u2019s what gets you through all of the rest. That\u2019s what makes it worth doing.\u201d What others say: \u201cTrudeau probably reads more than any other politician I know. And yet you wouldn\u2019t know this from the way he talks about ideas: his boyish, eager-to-please personality leads him to project publicly in a way that can seem intellectually unsophisticated. Political oratory always sounds best when it\u2019s relaxed and natural. Trudeau\u2019s hyperactive personality makes that a difficult act for him to pull off.\u201d \u2013 Canadian journalist and editor-in-chief of the Walrus magazine Jonathan Kay.",

But Canada now has a fighting chance | Martin Lukacs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The birth of such a dynasty is new for Canada, but not elsewhere. For the dynasty is the franchise movie of politics: the reliable brand that brought in the crowds before and enjoys an automatic box-office advantage over all rivals. Where Bond, Superman and the Transformers are the titans of cinema, so the Clintons and Bushes, the Gandhis, Kenyattas and now Trudeaus dominate politics around the globe.</p> <p>It\u2019s one of the more unexpected features of modern democracy. Those who demanded popular self-rule centuries ago partly did so as an explicit rejection of heredity as a qualification for power. Gone would be the ruling families of the ancien regime, replaced by elected representatives of the entire people. The spirit of that earlier age is captured by article 1, section 9, clause 8 of the US constitution: \u201cNo title of nobility shall be granted by the United States.\u201d</p> <p>She may not be the Duchess of Little Rock, but Hillary Clinton surely belongs to the very nobility America\u2019s founders wanted to prevent. Power and wealth is concentrated in her clan. So it is with&#xa0;the&#xa0;Cuomo family, holders past and present of the governorship of New&#xa0;York, or the Daleys, who held Chicago as tightly as any medieval baron&#xa0;once ruled a fief.</p> <p>Hillary took a further step towards her destiny this week, thanks to the announcement by vice-president Joe Biden that he will <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/21/joe-biden-presidential-run-speech\" title=\"\">not be a rival</a> for the Democratic nomination, and to a promised <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/22/hillary-clinton-benghazi-attack-hearing\" title=\"\">congressional grilling</a> on the&#xa0;Benghazi affair that sputtered without catching a spark.

In Indonesia, rule-by-dynasty is so rife, parliament passed a law in March <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/whats-wrong-with-dynastic-politics\" title=\"\">to bar anyone holding major office within five years of a relative</a> \u2013 a kind of genetic cooling-off period. (The law was later thrown out as unconstitutional.) In some regions, a single clan can hold up to a dozen political posts at once. Presumably, when one resigns, they say they\u2019re quitting politics so they can spend less time with their family.</p> <p>Britain seems less susceptible to the electoral lure of bloodline than most, despite the fact that, or maybe because, we still give heredity a formal place in our constitution \u2013 guaranteeing the headship of state to a single family. Nevertheless, after the double Miliband era there is now a junior Kinnock in the Commons, with perhaps a Straw and even a Blair on the way. And the new politics is not immune: John McDonnell\u2019s chief of staff is Seb&#xa0;Corbyn,&#xa0;son of Jeremy.</p> <p>Not that we should single out politics.&#xa0;The corporate world is similarly&#xa0;the domain of dominant families, whether it\u2019s the Murdoch empire or beleaguered Volkswagen. The&#xa0;Economist recently estimated that <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21648639-enduring-power-families-business-and-politics-should-trouble-believers\" title=\"\">90% of the world\u2019s businesses are family-managed or controlled</a>, with one&#xa0;in three of America\u2019s biggest, billion-dollar firms in family hands. And the media of course is not immune, whether it\u2019s the Russerts of the US, the Lapids of Israel or our very own Dimblebys.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/22/hillary-clinton-benghazi-attack-hearing\">Hillary Clinton deflects conservative jabs in 11-hour House Benghazi hearing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So why does the dynasty live on, even&#xa0;in this supposedly democratic age? The answer is paradoxical. The powerful family may seem an ancient idea but it&#xa0;boasts two ultra-modern features: such clans have a strong brand, essential&#xa0;in cutting through the noise; and they come equipped with rich, intricate networks, dense with connections and social capital. When the time comes, Chelsea Clinton will inherit not just wealth but the mother and father of all Rolodexes.</p> <p>You can defend dynasty. There\u2019s evidence to suggest such families think more of the long term than other politicians. They want their plans to look good in decades to come, otherwise their children might never succeed them.</p> <p>And the bias towards established families has arguably helped women reach a pinnacle that might otherwise have remained elusive. Would India have elected a woman who was not Nehru\u2019s daughter? Is it a coincidence that the first woman on the brink of the White House has lived there before?</p> <p>Of course, everyone should be judged on their individual merits: they should not be disqualified because of their parents. And yet the stubborn grip of dynasticism epitomises social immobility at the highest level, a clustering of one group at the top of the ladder crowding out everyone else. Politics becomes a kind of Shakespearean clashing of clans&#xa0;at court \u2013 surely one day, a Clinton&#xa0;will fall in love with a Bush&#xa0;\u2013&#xa0;leaving the country behind.</p> <p>You can\u2019t legislate to stop this happening, but we can insist on a wider, more fluid, more genuine social mobility. Otherwise politics will become ever more like the cinema \u2013 new faces, perhaps, but telling the same old story.</p>",

          "bodyText": "Will you be among those queuing to see Spectre next week? If you are, you don\u2019t need to explain why. It\u2019s simple. It\u2019s the new Bond movie and you like Bond movies. The tidal wave of publicity \u2013 the magazine covers, the posters at bus-stops, the song on the radio \u2013 none of it needs to persuade you of the merits of this particular film. It just needs to remind you that the film is out \u2013 that \u201cBond is back\u201d \u2013 and its job is done. Effortlessly, the glamour and excitement of the past rubs off on the present. This week Justin Trudeau, handsome enough to play James Bond, as it happens, was elected as the new prime minister of Canada. He succeeded where his Liberal party had failed four years earlier. Even his greatest admirers do not deny that part of his appeal resides in his last name. He is the son of the former PM Pierre Trudeau and his much younger wife, Margaret, and some of the glamour and excitement of that past era has rubbed off on him. The birth of such a dynasty is new for Canada, but not elsewhere. For the dynasty is the franchise movie of politics: the reliable brand that brought in the crowds before and enjoys an automatic box-office advantage over all rivals. Where Bond, Superman and the Transformers are the titans of cinema, so the Clintons and Bushes, the Gandhis, Kenyattas and now Trudeaus dominate politics around the globe. It\u2019s one of the more unexpected features of modern democracy. Those who demanded popular self-rule centuries ago partly did so as an explicit rejection of heredity as a qualification for power. Gone would be the ruling families of the ancien regime, replaced by elected representatives of the entire people. The spirit of that earlier age is captured by article 1, section 9, clause 8 of the US constitution: \u201cNo title of nobility shall be granted by the United States.\u201d She may not be the Duchess of Little Rock, but Hillary Clinton surely belongs to the very nobility America\u2019s founders wanted to prevent. Power and wealth is concentrated in her clan. So it is with the Cuomo family, holders past and present of the governorship of New York, or the Daleys, who held Chicago as tightly as any medieval baron once ruled a fief. Hillary took a further step towards her destiny this week, thanks to the announcement by vice-president Joe Biden that he will not be a rival for the Democratic nomination, and to a promised congressional grilling on the Benghazi affair that sputtered without catching a spark. Soon, it seems, Clinton will be facing a Republican field that features Rand Paul, inheritor of the libertarian movement galvanised by his father Ron, and Jeb Bush, bidding to be the third US president in his immediate family. Despite the constitution\u2019s best efforts, the American electorate have been drawn from the start to the de facto nobility formed by its power dynasties. One study found that 11% of those who served in the US Congress between 1789 and 1858 had lawmaker relatives. As late as 1966, the figure stood at 7%. Even today, the son of a senator is 8,500 times more likely to become a senator than the average male of baby-boom age. It turns out the Roosevelts and Kennedys were not exceptions. They were just the ones we had heard of. And it\u2019s like that everywhere. This week\u2019s feted visitor to Britain, Chinese president Xi Jinping, is the son of the country\u2019s former vice-premier. The democratic world is not much better. In France, the Front National is being fought over like a precious item of family silver by the warring Le Pens, p\u00e8re et fille. The president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, has four children with the defeated presidential candidate of 2007, S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal. In India, the Gandhis lost last time but are still a fixture on the electoral landscape. In Kenya, the son sits in the presidential chair first occupied by his father. A likely contender for Peru\u2019s 2016 election is Keiko Fujimori, whose now-jailed father ruled the country until 2000. In Indonesia, rule-by-dynasty is so rife, parliament passed a law in March to bar anyone holding major office within five years of a relative \u2013 a kind of genetic cooling-off period. (The law was later thrown out as unconstitutional.) In some regions, a single clan can hold up to a dozen political posts at once. Presumably, when one resigns, they say they\u2019re quitting politics so they can spend less time with their family. Britain seems less susceptible to the electoral lure of bloodline than most, despite the fact that, or maybe because, we still give heredity a formal place in our constitution \u2013 guaranteeing the headship of state to a single family. Nevertheless, after the double Miliband era there is now a junior Kinnock in the Commons, with perhaps a Straw and even a Blair on the way. And the new politics is not immune: John McDonnell\u2019s chief of staff is Seb Corbyn, son of Jeremy. Not that we should single out politics. The corporate world is similarly the domain of dominant families, whether it\u2019s the Murdoch empire or beleaguered Volkswagen. The Economist recently estimated that 90% of the world\u2019s businesses are family-managed or controlled, with one in three of America\u2019s biggest, billion-dollar firms in family hands. And the media of course is not immune, whether it\u2019s the Russerts of the US, the Lapids of Israel or our very own Dimblebys. So why does the dynasty live on, even in this supposedly democratic age? The answer is paradoxical. The powerful family may seem an ancient idea but it boasts two ultra-modern features: such clans have a strong brand, essential in cutting through the noise; and they come equipped with rich, intricate networks, dense with connections and social capital. When the time comes, Chelsea Clinton will inherit not just wealth but the mother and father of all Rolodexes. You can defend dynasty. There\u2019s evidence to suggest such families think more of the long term than other politicians. They want their plans to look good in decades to come, otherwise their children might never succeed them. And the bias towards established families has arguably helped women reach a pinnacle that might otherwise have remained elusive. Would India have elected a woman who was not Nehru\u2019s daughter? Is it a coincidence that the first woman on the brink of the White House has lived there before? Of course, everyone should be judged on their individual merits: they should not be disqualified because of their parents. And yet the stubborn grip of dynasticism epitomises social immobility at the highest level, a clustering of one group at the top of the ladder crowding out everyone else. Politics becomes a kind of Shakespearean clashing of clans at court \u2013 surely one day, a Clinton will fall in love with a Bush \u2013 leaving the country behind. You can\u2019t legislate to stop this happening, but we can insist on a wider, more fluid, more genuine social mobility. Otherwise politics will become ever more like the cinema \u2013 new faces, perhaps, but telling the same old story.",

But the website On Islam counted at least 10 Muslim candidates among those who were elected on Monday, which would be a record for the country according to Al Jazeera.

Harper has been on the other side of the microphone too when he interviewed Wayne Gretzky and Gordie Howe at a charity event in 2010. </p> <h2>Company spokesman</h2> <p>Harper\u2019s ability to keep journalists at bay over the years makes him the ideal candidate for a public relations position. The company he works for would never release unwanted information to journalists again with him on the payroll. Harper was awarded the Canadian Association of Journalists Code of Silence award in 2007. \u201cHarper\u2019s white-knuckled death grip on public information makes this the easiest decision the cabal of judges has ever rendered,\u201d said CAJ president Mary Agnes Welch. \u201cHe\u2019s gone beyond merely gagging cabinet ministers and professional civil servants, stalling access to information requests and blackballing reporters who ask tough questions. He has built a pervasive government apparatus whose sole purpose is to strangle the flow of public information.\u201d</p>",

He even posted a video during his campaign assuring voters that he \u201cloves movies and TV shows\u201d. \u201cOne of my all time favorites is Breaking Bad,\u201d Harper said. \u201cIt\u2019s even available on some online streaming services if you\u2019ve never seen it.\u201d Sports commentator The outgoing prime minister is a long-time hockey fan. He wrote a book on the growth of professional hockey in Toronto titled A Great Game: The Forgotten Leafs and the Rise of Professional Hockey. He was also interviewed by the Sports Network during the 2007 World Junior Ice Hockey championships between Canada and Russia. Harper has been on the other side of the microphone too when he interviewed Wayne Gretzky and Gordie Howe at a charity event in 2010. Company spokesman Harper\u2019s ability to keep journalists at bay over the years makes him the ideal candidate for a public relations position. The company he works for would never release unwanted information to journalists again with him on the payroll. Harper was awarded the Canadian Association of Journalists Code of Silence award in 2007. \u201cHarper\u2019s white-knuckled death grip on public information makes this the easiest decision the cabal of judges has ever rendered,\u201d said CAJ president Mary Agnes Welch. \u201cHe\u2019s gone beyond merely gagging cabinet ministers and professional civil servants, stalling access to information requests and blackballing reporters who ask tough questions. He has built a pervasive government apparatus whose sole purpose is to strangle the flow of public information.\u201d",

(Canadians are already over that, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0e9D2rBN9w\">having seen him doff his shirt in stripteases and boxing matches for charity over the years</a>.)</p> <p>So, is it time for Cool Canadiana? </p> <p>I\u2019m not so sure: Drake and Justin Bieber and even relative newcomer the Weeknd are products of what\u2019s called the <a href=\"http://www.theharperdecade.com/\">Harper Decade</a> \u2013 the nine and two-thirds years Conservative Stephen Harper sat in the prime minister\u2019s office, the last four holding a majority government and a tight leash on the country\u2019s scientists, statisticians and public servants of all stripes. </p> <p>But these chart-toppers do tell about the election \u2013 because Canada\u2019s power struggle at the ballot box and on Billboard is concentrated in the exact same part of the country.</p> <p>Both races for No 1 were both fought almost entirely in Ontario.</p> <p>The Weeknd, Drake and Bieber all hail from Canada\u2019s most populous province, where more than a third of the seats in the House of Commons of Canada are elected.</p> <p>The road to Trudeau\u2019s victory went through Toronto \u2013 a city that\u2019s been redubbed and mythologized as <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/we-the-6-why-the-name-drake-gave-us-is-here-to-stay/article25421112/\">the 6ix</a> by local hero Drake on his recent albums \u2013 and into the surrounding area. His Liberals captured all 25 of Toronto\u2019s seats, and all but five seats in what\u2019s known as the Greater Toronto area. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79AR0VC5wCA\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/79AR0VC5wCA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>There was a time when the Liberal party running through the 6ix with Trudeau (apologies to Drake) would not have seemed unusual. But over the Harper decade, the city and province\u2019s demographics and politics became unpredictable. The Conservatives found their slim majority here in 2011, and Toronto, of course, became known internationally as home to the crack-smoking rightwing (thank God, now former) mayor <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/13/crack-smoking-toronto-mayor-rob-ford-epitomises-canada\">Rob Ford</a> in recent years. </p> <p>If you want to see where Trudeau won his majority, you have to visit where the Weeknd grew up. Abel Tesfaye, the son of Ethiopian immigrants, is from Scarborough, the former city that now forms the eastern end of Toronto. </p> <p>It\u2019s the most diverse part of a city where roughly half of residents are foreign-born and visible minorities \u2013 and it was also prime Ford Nation territory. Forty-eight per cent of residents voted for Rob Ford\u2019s brother in the last municipal election, and that\u2019s after the scandals.</p> <p>But Harper\u2019s last-ditch effort to win Scarberians and other like-minded voters over by holding a rally with the Fords was for naught. Going into Monday\u2019s election, two of Scarborough\u2019s ridings were held by the NDP, the party to the left of the Liberals, and the other two were held by Conservatives. By the end of the night, it was all Trudeau. </p> <p>And that Liberal support bled right out of the 6ix and into next-door Mississauga \u2013 what Drake calls \u201cSauga City\u201d on 2015\u2019s If You\u2019re Reading This It\u2019s Too Late \u2013 and other diverse cities nearby like Brampton. </p> <p>Where the Trudeau triumph stopped was almost exactly at home of Justin Bieber, who hails from the conservative Ontario small town of Stratford. </p> <p>During a drive there from Toronto, about an hour and a half by car, the shift in political climate and local priorities is abundantly clear as a giant billboard comparing abortion to the Holocaust greets visitors on the highway into town.</p> <p>And, indeed, Stratford tells the second story of this 2015 election \u2013 which is that, despite Harper alienating whole swaths of electors with his petty approach to politics, the Conservatives still managed to hold on to 99 seats and about 30% of the popular vote; it was not a rout by any means.</p> <p>In Bieber\u2019s hometown, Conservative candidate <a href=\"http://www.stratfordbeaconherald.com/2015/10/19/door-to-door-canvassing-key-for-nater\">John Nater</a> was elected by just under 3,000 votes, with the local Liberal and NDP candidates splitting the Anyone But Harper vote. That\u2019s the type of divided centre-left that led to the last Conservative majority \u2013 and could lead to another one if the party finds a charismatic new leader. </p> <p>By the way, if you look at the Canadian Billboard charts from Monday, you see a list slightly different from the US version. It perfectly echoes the election results \u2013 the Weeknd on top with The Hills, but Justin Bieber in second place. What Do You Mean?, indeed.</p>",

          "bodyText": "There was a pair of battles between Canadians for first, second and third place on Monday. While the country\u2019s main political parties \u2013 the Liberals, the Conservatives and the NDP \u2013 were fighting it out in the federal election, our three mega music stars of the moment \u2013 the Weeknd, Drake and Justin Bieber \u2013 were jostling for position at the top of the pop charts in the US. Justin Trudeau \u2013 son of former prime minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau and no longer the second most-famous Justin in Canada \u2013 was the winner at the polls, sweeping his Liberal party from third-place, left for dead, to a majority government on Monday in a closer-than-it looked result. But it was the Weeknd who won the Billboard Hot 100 \u2013 his single The Hills at No 1 for the fifth week in a row. Drake\u2019s Hotline Bling came in second for a second week, while Bieber\u2019s What Do You Mean? was in third. There\u2019s a temptation to compare this Canadian peak moment of optimism and poptimism to the rise of Cool Britannia \u2013 when a young prime minister named Tony Blair took office as Britpop was all over the charts. After all, our new 43-year-old prime minister has a certain poster-boy charm \u2013 dubbed by a PMILF by international observers just spying his handsome, youthful face for the first time. (Canadians are already over that, having seen him doff his shirt in stripteases and boxing matches for charity over the years.) So, is it time for Cool Canadiana? I\u2019m not so sure: Drake and Justin Bieber and even relative newcomer the Weeknd are products of what\u2019s called the Harper Decade \u2013 the nine and two-thirds years Conservative Stephen Harper sat in the prime minister\u2019s office, the last four holding a majority government and a tight leash on the country\u2019s scientists, statisticians and public servants of all stripes. But these chart-toppers do tell about the election \u2013 because Canada\u2019s power struggle at the ballot box and on Billboard is concentrated in the exact same part of the country. Both races for No 1 were both fought almost entirely in Ontario. The Weeknd, Drake and Bieber all hail from Canada\u2019s most populous province, where more than a third of the seats in the House of Commons of Canada are elected. The road to Trudeau\u2019s victory went through Toronto \u2013 a city that\u2019s been redubbed and mythologized as the 6ix by local hero Drake on his recent albums \u2013 and into the surrounding area. His Liberals captured all 25 of Toronto\u2019s seats, and all but five seats in what\u2019s known as the Greater Toronto area. There was a time when the Liberal party running through the 6ix with Trudeau (apologies to Drake) would not have seemed unusual. But over the Harper decade, the city and province\u2019s demographics and politics became unpredictable. The Conservatives found their slim majority here in 2011, and Toronto, of course, became known internationally as home to the crack-smoking rightwing (thank God, now former) mayor Rob Ford in recent years. If you want to see where Trudeau won his majority, you have to visit where the Weeknd grew up. Abel Tesfaye, the son of Ethiopian immigrants, is from Scarborough, the former city that now forms the eastern end of Toronto. It\u2019s the most diverse part of a city where roughly half of residents are foreign-born and visible minorities \u2013 and it was also prime Ford Nation territory. Forty-eight per cent of residents voted for Rob Ford\u2019s brother in the last municipal election, and that\u2019s after the scandals. But Harper\u2019s last-ditch effort to win Scarberians and other like-minded voters over by holding a rally with the Fords was for naught. Going into Monday\u2019s election, two of Scarborough\u2019s ridings were held by the NDP, the party to the left of the Liberals, and the other two were held by Conservatives. By the end of the night, it was all Trudeau. And that Liberal support bled right out of the 6ix and into next-door Mississauga \u2013 what Drake calls \u201cSauga City\u201d on 2015\u2019s If You\u2019re Reading This It\u2019s Too Late \u2013 and other diverse cities nearby like Brampton. Where the Trudeau triumph stopped was almost exactly at home of Justin Bieber, who hails from the conservative Ontario small town of Stratford. During a drive there from Toronto, about an hour and a half by car, the shift in political climate and local priorities is abundantly clear as a giant billboard comparing abortion to the Holocaust greets visitors on the highway into town. And, indeed, Stratford tells the second story of this 2015 election \u2013 which is that, despite Harper alienating whole swaths of electors with his petty approach to politics, the Conservatives still managed to hold on to 99 seats and about 30% of the popular vote; it was not a rout by any means. In Bieber\u2019s hometown, Conservative candidate John Nater was elected by just under 3,000 votes, with the local Liberal and NDP candidates splitting the Anyone But Harper vote. That\u2019s the type of divided centre-left that led to the last Conservative majority \u2013 and could lead to another one if the party finds a charismatic new leader. By the way, if you look at the Canadian Billboard charts from Monday, you see a list slightly different from the US version. It perfectly echoes the election results \u2013 the Weeknd on top with The Hills, but Justin Bieber in second place. What Do You Mean?, indeed.",

Drastic cuts to funding and constraints on scientific freedom have significantly damaged Canadian research and its capacity to develop science-based public health and environmental policies.</p> <p>Harper\u2019s assault on science was <a href=\"http://scienceblogs.com/confessions/2013/05/20/the-canadian-war-on-science-a-long-unexaggerated-devastating-chronological-indictment/\">extensive</a>: with government scientists censored, budgets chopped, data monitoring programs eliminated, scientific libraries shuttered and the contents thrown into dumpsters. The <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/we-havent-forgotten-the-long-form-census/article22819338/ \">long form census was axed</a>, depriving decision makers of vital information about their citizens.</p> <p>The cumulative consequences for government scientists were profound. \u201cYou don\u2019t become a biologist to get rich or powerful,\u201d says <a href=\"http://mnr-ards.academia.edu/JayFitzsimmons\">Jay Fitzsimmons</a> Fitzsimmons was speaking in a personal capacity as a former Environment Canada science adviser, but is currently a biologist with the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources. \u201cYou become a biologist because you love nature and science. To work under a government that tries to silence scientists is pretty demoralizing.\u201d</p> <p>The issue that received the most attention was the so-called \u201cmuzzling\u201d of government scientists. This week, Liberal MP Marc Garneau said that these restrictions <a href=\"https://twitter.com/margaretmunro/status/656337183025045504?lang=en\">would be eliminated</a> \u201cright away.\u201d </p> <p>The chilling of speech extended beyond the walls of government labs to environmental organizations (which quickly found that any criticism of the government would lead to <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/article/heres-why-environmental-groups-are-afraid-to-speak-out-in-canadas-election\">investigations of their tax status</a>) and university scientists who receive government funding. \u201cFinally I feel I can openly follow certain politicians and speak publicly on issues without fear it will result in cuts to my research funding,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SJC_fishy/status/656298967395758080\">says Carleton University fish ecologist Steven Cooke</a>.</p> <p>Things got so bad that scientists and their supporters took to the streets. They <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/stand-up-for-science-rallies-target-federal-government-1.1855977\">demonstrated in Ottawa</a>. They formed an organization, <a href=\"https://evidencefordemocracy.ca/\">Evidence for Democracy</a>, to bring push back on political interference in science. Awareness-raising forums were held at campuses throughout Canada. And the onslaught on science was <a href=\"http://scienceblogs.com/confessions/2013/05/20/the-canadian-war-on-science-a-long-unexaggerated-devastating-chronological-indictment/\">painstakingly documented</a>, which tends to happen when you go after librarians. </p> <p>The union that represents many government scientists, the Professional Institute of the Public Service, surveyed its members and published <a href=\"http://www.pipsc.ca/portal/page/portal/website/issues/science/bigchill\">damning evidence</a> of problems in government departments. Its is now making scientific integrity the centerpiece of its <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/federal-scientists-push-for-protection-from-political-interference/article24473222/\">current round of collective bargaining</a>. </p> <p>All of these efforts began to attract significant domestic and international attention. There were numerous stories in the media. Opposition MPs took to the Parliament floor to denounce attacks on science. <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/fifth/episodes/2013-2014/the-silence-of-the-labs\">CBC ran a documentary</a>, cleverly titled \u201cThe Silence of the Labs.\u201d There was even a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ei50lM6ab1c\">folk song, Harperman, which went viral</a> after Environment Canada suspended geographer Tony Turner for performing it. \u201cI knew the song was a little edgy but I believe I was within my rights to sing that song,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/02/canadaman-protest-song-harperman-stephen-harper\">he told the Guardian</a>. </p> <p>Eight hundred scientists from thirty-two countries <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/foreign-scientists-call-on-stephen-harper-to-restore-science-funding-freedom-1.2806571\">wrote an open letter</a> urging the prime minster to ease restrictions on scientists and data. In October 2014, a Ryerson University professor <a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/content/350/6257/139.full\">wrote in <em>Science </em>magazine</a> that the election presented an \u201copportunity to reboot the federal government\u2019s controversial approach to science policy and research.\u201d</p> <p>All of this advocacy worked. Science became a major campaign issue during the election. There were all-party <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/radio/quirks/quirks-quarks-for-oct-10-2015-1.3264916/all-party-election-science-debate-1.3264954\">debates</a> on science policy and extensive <a href=\"http://thechronicleherald.ca/opinion/1314615-mcilveen-scientists-leave-labs-to-fight-for-change-at-ballot-box#.VhLSiAiMj1M.twitter\">media coverage</a>.

Fortunately, Canada now has a <a href=\"http://scienceintegrity.ca/\">Scientific Integrity Project</a>, which has put a lot of thought into these issues, and the new government would be wise to consult them. </p> <p>Appointing a science adviser and removing speech restrictions should be pretty straightforward. Cultural change will come more slowly. And there\u2019s not a moment to lose. \u201cTo maintain the status quo would be to leave the festering wound to rot, leaving no option but to cut off the limb,\u201d says freshwater ecologist <a href=\"https://www.lakeheadu.ca/academics/departments/biology/news-events/news/node/24202 \">Michael Rennie of Ontario\u2019s Lakehead University</a>. He calls for immediate reinvestment in government-based research, as well as the scrapping of bureaucratic rules that make it difficult for departments to hire scientists and for scientists to travel to scientific conferences.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a lot of work to be done to keep the pressure on to make sure that they prioritize science once in office and make good on these election promises,\u201d says <a href=\"https://evidencefordemocracy.ca/en/users/katie-gibbs\">Evidence for Democracy\u2019s executive director Katie Gibbs</a>. \u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to keeping the scientific community mobilized to make these campaign commitments a reality.\u201d</p> <p>In the United States, many celebrated the end of the Bush administration in 2008, thinking that its restrictions on science would evaporate the moment that the Obama administration took office. It wasn\u2019t true. There has been significant progress in protecting scientists from political influence. But the public has still lacked access to scientific information on multiple environmental and public health issues. </p> <p>So who will keep watch over the new government, as it\u2019s forced to choose among its many priorities? Canadian unions, scientists, policy experts and activists need to continue to push for real change. It\u2019s up to those who care most about science and democracy to keep Trudeau on his toes.</p> <p>This piece was edited on 27 October 2015 to reflect the fact that Jay Fitzsimmons was commenting in a private capacity and not on behalf the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources.</p> <p><em><a href=\"http://www.ucsusa.org/about/staff/staff/michael-halpern.html\">Michael Halpern</a></em><em> </em><em>(<a href=\"https://twitter.com/halpsci\">@halpsci</a>) is manager of strategy and innovation for the Center for Science and Democracy at the</em><em> </em><em><a href=\"http://www.ucsusa.org/\">Union of Concerned Scientists</a>.</em></p>",

          "bodyText": "There was a palpable outpouring of relief from Canadian scientists as the Liberal Party won a majority on Monday night, bringing to an end nine years of escalating hostility by the Harper government towards its own research base. Drastic cuts to funding and constraints on scientific freedom have significantly damaged Canadian research and its capacity to develop science-based public health and environmental policies. Harper\u2019s assault on science was extensive: with government scientists censored, budgets chopped, data monitoring programs eliminated, scientific libraries shuttered and the contents thrown into dumpsters. The long form census was axed, depriving decision makers of vital information about their citizens. The cumulative consequences for government scientists were profound. \u201cYou don\u2019t become a biologist to get rich or powerful,\u201d says Jay Fitzsimmons Fitzsimmons was speaking in a personal capacity as a former Environment Canada science adviser, but is currently a biologist with the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources. \u201cYou become a biologist because you love nature and science. To work under a government that tries to silence scientists is pretty demoralizing.\u201d The issue that received the most attention was the so-called \u201cmuzzling\u201d of government scientists. This week, Liberal MP Marc Garneau said that these restrictions would be eliminated \u201cright away.\u201d The chilling of speech extended beyond the walls of government labs to environmental organizations (which quickly found that any criticism of the government would lead to investigations of their tax status) and university scientists who receive government funding. \u201cFinally I feel I can openly follow certain politicians and speak publicly on issues without fear it will result in cuts to my research funding,\u201d says Carleton University fish ecologist Steven Cooke. Things got so bad that scientists and their supporters took to the streets. They demonstrated in Ottawa. They formed an organization, Evidence for Democracy, to bring push back on political interference in science. Awareness-raising forums were held at campuses throughout Canada. And the onslaught on science was painstakingly documented, which tends to happen when you go after librarians. The union that represents many government scientists, the Professional Institute of the Public Service, surveyed its members and published damning evidence of problems in government departments. Its is now making scientific integrity the centerpiece of its current round of collective bargaining. All of these efforts began to attract significant domestic and international attention. There were numerous stories in the media. Opposition MPs took to the Parliament floor to denounce attacks on science. CBC ran a documentary, cleverly titled \u201cThe Silence of the Labs.\u201d There was even a folk song, Harperman, which went viral after Environment Canada suspended geographer Tony Turner for performing it. \u201cI knew the song was a little edgy but I believe I was within my rights to sing that song,\u201d he told the Guardian. Eight hundred scientists from thirty-two countries wrote an open letter urging the prime minster to ease restrictions on scientists and data. In October 2014, a Ryerson University professor wrote in Science magazine that the election presented an \u201copportunity to reboot the federal government\u2019s controversial approach to science policy and research.\u201d All of this advocacy worked. Science became a major campaign issue during the election. There were all-party debates on science policy and extensive media coverage. The Green, Liberal and NDP platforms included significant commitments to restore science to its rightful place in society and public policy. \u201cWe\u2019ll reverse the $40 million cut that Harper made to our federal ocean science and monitoring programs,\u201d said Liberal leader Justin Trudeau at a September campaign stop. \u201cThe war on science ends with the liberal government.\u201d In tweet after tweet after tweet, opposition candidates argued that they were best positioned to defend scientific integrity. Now that it\u2019s been elected with a healthy majority, the Liberal Party says it will make data openly available, unmuzzle scientists, bring back the long form census, appoint a chief science officer, and make the agency Statistics Canada fully independent. Of course, more is required to make this agenda complete. Fortunately, Canada now has a Scientific Integrity Project, which has put a lot of thought into these issues, and the new government would be wise to consult them. Appointing a science adviser and removing speech restrictions should be pretty straightforward. Cultural change will come more slowly. And there\u2019s not a moment to lose. \u201cTo maintain the status quo would be to leave the festering wound to rot, leaving no option but to cut off the limb,\u201d says freshwater ecologist Michael Rennie of Ontario\u2019s Lakehead University. He calls for immediate reinvestment in government-based research, as well as the scrapping of bureaucratic rules that make it difficult for departments to hire scientists and for scientists to travel to scientific conferences. \u201cThere is a lot of work to be done to keep the pressure on to make sure that they prioritize science once in office and make good on these election promises,\u201d says Evidence for Democracy\u2019s executive director Katie Gibbs. \u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to keeping the scientific community mobilized to make these campaign commitments a reality.\u201d In the United States, many celebrated the end of the Bush administration in 2008, thinking that its restrictions on science would evaporate the moment that the Obama administration took office. It wasn\u2019t true. There has been significant progress in protecting scientists from political influence. But the public has still lacked access to scientific information on multiple environmental and public health issues. So who will keep watch over the new government, as it\u2019s forced to choose among its many priorities? Canadian unions, scientists, policy experts and activists need to continue to push for real change. It\u2019s up to those who care most about science and democracy to keep Trudeau on his toes. This piece was edited on 27 October 2015 to reflect the fact that Jay Fitzsimmons was commenting in a private capacity and not on behalf the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources.
