          "bodyText": "The US and Canada declared they would help lead the transition to a low-carbon global economy on Thursday, in a dramatic role reversal for two countries once derided as climate change villains. The shared vision unveiled by Barack Obama and Justin Trudeau ahead of a meeting at the White House commits the two countries to a range of actions to shore up the historic climate agreement reached in Paris last December. The two leaders committed to rally G20 countries behind the accord, promote North American carbon markets, cap emissions from hundreds of thousands of existing oil and gas wells, and protect indigenous communities in a region which is warming beyond the point of no return, according to a statement from the White House. The initiative announced on Thursday brings the US a big step closer to meeting its own Paris target by committing for the first time to cut emissions of methane - a powerful greenhouse gas responsible for about a quarter of warming - from existing oil and gas wells. The biggest news however might be the final break with the policies of their predecessors who obstructed global efforts to fight climate change.

          "bodyText": "Barack Obama will welcome his Canadian counterpart Justin Trudeau to Washington on Thursday for an official state visit likely to stoke comparisons between two leaders who came to power as fresh, charismatic liberal darlings with star power. The president and prime minister will hold talks on issues including energy and climate change, security, and trade. A glimpse of them together at the White House may provide fleeting solace to those in North America fearful of the rise of Donald Trump and fellow climate change naysayers. \u201cI think there is a developing special relationship between this president and the prime minister,\u201d said Mark Feierstein, the White House National Security Council\u2019s senior director for the western hemisphere. \u201cBoth young leaders with similar visions. Both have a progressive vision of governing. Both are very much committed to the appropriate use of multilateral tools. Both are committed to diversity. \u201cAnd I think there is a coincidence very much in terms of the agendas that both administrations have. And I think we\u2019re seeing that reflected, for example, on the issues of climate change and refugees and other issues. So this will be a good opportunity for the president and prime minister to expand that relationship and build on that.\u201d Like the Obamas, Trudeau and his equally telegenic wife, Sophie Gregoire-Trudeau, have captured the public imagination and earned comparisons with the Kennedys. \u201cJustin Fever hits Washington,\u201d said a headline this week on the Politico website, nodding to the 44-year-old\u2019s pop-star looks. After years in which Canadians were fascinated by Obama, the tables have finally been turned, observed Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, which borders Canada. \u201cObviously they both came in on platforms of change and they came in at a time when the countries wanted to see something different and a new approach,\u201d she said at a Politico event in Washington on Tuesday. \u201cBut there is one thing that\u2019s different beside the fact the president notes that his hair is a little greyer now. President Obama came in at a time of crisis: we were in the worst economic freefall since the depression. Trudeau is coming in at a time where at least the economy is stable, giving him this moment where he can do some of the things Obama wishes he had done at the beginning.\u201d Yet not so long ago, Trudeau, a former teacher, was better known for his famous father Pierre, also prime minister, and beating Conservative senator Patrick Brazeau in a charity boxing match in 2012. He also posed topless for photos showing off his trim figure and upper-arm tattoo. He entered politics with a bang and last year his Liberal party defeated Canada\u2019s long-ruling Conservatives by promising a new era of \u201csunny ways\u201d. He swiftly gave half the seats in his cabinet to women \u201cbecause it\u2019s 2015\u201d and named a defense minister who is a leading member of Canada\u2019s Sikh community. Trudeau also kept some of his more contentious promises, including welcoming 25,000 Syrian refugees when other nations were closing their borders. Senate Republicans have raised concerns that refugees reaching Canada could cross the \u201cporous border\u201d and put Americans at risk, even holding a committee hearing on Capitol Hill about the issue. Alan Bersin, assistant secretary for international affairs at the Department of Homeland Security, told the Politico event: \u201cEntry-exit, pre-clearance, enhanced information sharing \u2013 I think all of those we should expect will be the subject of announcements during the course of the visit.\u201d Although the countries share innumerable family and cultural ties, this will be the first Canadian state visit to the US for 19 years. When Trudeau\u2019s outspoken mother, Margaret, attended a White House state dinner in 1977, she ruffled fashion critics by wearing a dress that ended above the knee. Relations between Obama and Trudeau\u2019s predecessor, Stephen Harper of the Conservatives, were strained over Washington\u2019s unwillingness to support the Keystone XL pipeline.

A deal governing Canadian softwood lumber exports expired last year, and the two nations are talking about a new arrangement, Feierstein said. \u201cWe\u2019re open to exploring all options with Canada at this point.\u201d Another possible bone of contention has been Trudeau\u2019s decision to pull his country\u2019s fighter jets out of the US-led coalition\u2019s bombing campaign against Isis earlier this year. Some American liberals might also keep a close on eye on Trudeau out of naked self-interest: Trump\u2019s march towards the Republican nomination has coincided with a a sharp rise in Google searches for how to move to Canada.",

          "body": "<p>I hardly ever get to say this, but when it comes to faceswapping, I was an early adopter. I have proof. In late 2011, I posted a Facebook album called SWAPPED FACES, which consisted of 36 pictures of friends and family with their mugs superimposed on each other. As meme pioneering went, it was pretty impeccable. Founded on the app iSwap Faces, it featured your classic male-female and child-adult switches, and took an early, improvised step towards the more surreal variations that have lately become commonplace with a particularly uncanny shot of my friend Ross holding a dog, or, at least, my friend dog holding a Ross. Commenters were quick to recognise the importance of my work. \u201cThis is just one of the best things I have ever seen,\u201d one said. \u201cAgain, thank you.\u201d \u201cHoly fuck,\u201d said someone else. \u201cI\u2019m speechless. The taller one is particularly revolting.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c05e82c3a2783f7692cc1fa7d641f40081bb76ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c05e82c3a2783f7692cc1fa7d641f40081bb76ac/0_47_861_676/500.jpg\" alt=\"A faceswap of Jerry Hall and Rupert Murdoch.\" width=\"500\" height=\"393\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A faceswap of Jerry Hall and Rupert Murdoch.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the intervening years, maybe frustrated at a broader cultural failure to seize on this moment and run with it, or maybe conscious that it wasn\u2019t always cool to interrupt two people having a good time and make an image of them looking unsettlingly awful, I let faceswapping slide. I didn\u2019t want to just be known as the faceswap guy. I had other strings to my bow, apps that made people look older or hairier or otherwise a bit shonky, and the world seemed more able to appreciate those contributions. My own life was changing, too. I turned 30. I got a new job. For a while, I had a cat, which never seemed amenable to the practice. Faceswapping, I supposed, was behind me.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c4a1f7285309282f83cbbe488bb9de616e25d7fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c4a1f7285309282f83cbbe488bb9de616e25d7fa/102_14_1163_698/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Faceswap of William and Kate.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Royal mix-up: William and Kate.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lately, though, as I\u2019ve sought to establish my own personal brand on Instagram and discovered that the technology has caught up with my vision, I\u2019ve felt the tug of facial reassignment once again. And this time around, it seems, you idiots have caught up. Faceswapping (we should, I think, write it as one word) is everywhere now. Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau <a href=\"https://twitter.com/salutbonjour/status/677983941555449858\">has given it a whirl</a>, and there are any number of <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/11/13/kanye-west-and-north-wests-face-swap-would-give-kim-kardashian-an-aneurysm_n_8102754.html\">marvellous shots</a> of Kanye West morphed onto his daughter North, being coddled by his wife-mother Kim Kardashian. Faceswap Live, a definitive app that has revolutionised the field with its ability to record videos of people with each others\u2019 features, is the number-one paid app on the iPhone; MSQRD, a twist on the form that superimposes celebrities, animals and Iron Man helmets, is number three in the free category.

          "bodyText": "I hardly ever get to say this, but when it comes to faceswapping, I was an early adopter. I have proof. In late 2011, I posted a Facebook album called SWAPPED FACES, which consisted of 36 pictures of friends and family with their mugs superimposed on each other. As meme pioneering went, it was pretty impeccable. Founded on the app iSwap Faces, it featured your classic male-female and child-adult switches, and took an early, improvised step towards the more surreal variations that have lately become commonplace with a particularly uncanny shot of my friend Ross holding a dog, or, at least, my friend dog holding a Ross. Commenters were quick to recognise the importance of my work. \u201cThis is just one of the best things I have ever seen,\u201d one said. \u201cAgain, thank you.\u201d \u201cHoly fuck,\u201d said someone else. \u201cI\u2019m speechless. The taller one is particularly revolting.\u201d In the intervening years, maybe frustrated at a broader cultural failure to seize on this moment and run with it, or maybe conscious that it wasn\u2019t always cool to interrupt two people having a good time and make an image of them looking unsettlingly awful, I let faceswapping slide. I didn\u2019t want to just be known as the faceswap guy. I had other strings to my bow, apps that made people look older or hairier or otherwise a bit shonky, and the world seemed more able to appreciate those contributions. My own life was changing, too. I turned 30. I got a new job. For a while, I had a cat, which never seemed amenable to the practice. Faceswapping, I supposed, was behind me. Lately, though, as I\u2019ve sought to establish my own personal brand on Instagram and discovered that the technology has caught up with my vision, I\u2019ve felt the tug of facial reassignment once again. And this time around, it seems, you idiots have caught up. Faceswapping (we should, I think, write it as one word) is everywhere now. Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau has given it a whirl, and there are any number of marvellous shots of Kanye West morphed onto his daughter North, being coddled by his wife-mother Kim Kardashian. Faceswap Live, a definitive app that has revolutionised the field with its ability to record videos of people with each others\u2019 features, is the number-one paid app on the iPhone; MSQRD, a twist on the form that superimposes celebrities, animals and Iron Man helmets, is number three in the free category. People younger than me do it with a Snapchat filter. (iSwap Faces is barely a player any more, which I guess is how it goes.) Viral content websites have published ever more compilations of the best work out there, from men with babies for noses to people singing Drake\u2019s I\u2019m the Plug with the face of a plug, work that makes me feel as if I finally have peers.

          "bodyText": "Barack Obama and Justin Trudeau will commit to work together to fight climate change and protect an Arctic experiencing the mildest winter ever recorded, sources familiar with the initiatives said. The two leaders were expected to announce a number of common climate measures at a meeting at the White House this week, from a 45% cut in methane emissions from the oil and gas industry to protections for a rapidly warming Arctic. The state visit on Thursday is seen as an important moment for Trudeau to break with his Conservative predecessor, Stephen Harper, who was accused of muzzling government scientists and backtracking on climate promises. The visit \u2013 four months after Trudeau\u2019s election and 11 months before Obama leaves the White House \u2013 offered a rare window of opportunity to advance the cause that is important to both leaders, the Canadian prime minister said. \u201cThere is a nice alignment between a Canadian prime minister who wants to get all sorts of things done right off the bat and an American president who is thinking about the legacy he is going to leave in his last year in office,\u201d Trudeau told a Huffington Post town hall. \u201cThe issues that are important to him and to me are climate change \u2026 We\u2019re talking about border issues, as well \u2013 making sure there is a smooth flow of goods and people across our shared border that isn\u2019t putting our security at risk.\u201d Taking prime position among those issues was the Arctic \u2013 where winter temperatures are 7C above normal this year and the sea ice cover is also dwindling towards a new record low. In Alaska, the winter was so unseasonably warm that the authorities were forced to import freight cars full of snow for the launch of the annual Iditarod dog sledding race. The US took over from Canada last year as leader of the Arctic Council, the group of polar regional countries. The US and Canadian leaders were expected to use the Washington visit to announce a number of measures to protect remote communities and ecologically sensitive marine areas in the Arctic, sources familiar with the initiatives said. Some of those initiatives involved efforts to reduce reliance on diesel fuel \u2013 which is transported by barge into remote native Alaskan villages. With the melting of the Arctic summer sea ice, the region faces sweeping changes in the years and decades ahead. Shipping traffic in the North-west Passage and the Bering Sea is projected to rise by a factor of seven over the next decade \u2013 which could disrupt hunting and fishing by native Alaskan communities. The two leaders are also expected to announce joint initiatives in Arctic science research. Scientists have blamed the warming of the Arctic for changes in global weather patterns. Obama and Trudeau are also expected to announce common positions on reducing methane emissions from the oil and gas industry. Both countries have been edging towards a common 45% target for cutting emissions from methane \u2013 which is more than 80 times as warming as carbon dioxide. On Tuesday, the US State Department\u2019s climate envoy, Todd Stern, told reporters that methane emissions reductions would be an area the countries could work together on. In November last year, Alberta, Canada\u2019s main energy-producing province, unveiled a new climate plan proposing to reduce methane emissions from oil wells by 45% from 2014 levels by 2025. Two months later, Obama proposed new rules cutting methane emissions 45% from 2012 levels by 2025. Campaigners saw the curbs on methane as a chance to cap one of the fastest growing sources of climate pollution in recent years \u2013 because of the boom in oil and gas drilling. \u201cMethane is a very significant climate pollutant,\u201d said Erin Flanagan, the federal policy director for the Pembina Institute, a Canadian environmental thinktank.",

I disagreed with him,\u201d Romney said. </p> <p>\u201cThere are political views where we\u2019re going to disagree. But what he has said during this campaign - that George W. Bush is a liar, that John McCain isn\u2019t a hero - he said some things that are completely, totally outrageous.\u201d </p> <p>CNN\u2019s Gloria Borger continued to prod Romney further, pointing out that Obama would find it offensive that Trump insisted he wasn\u2019t born in the US. Romney again dismissed it as a futile exercise.</p> <p>\u201cThe funny thing about Donald Trump\u2019s whole birther thing is, it would have made no difference - Barack Obama\u2019s mother was American,\u201d Romney said. \u201cIt was a whole ridiculous thing that Donald Trump was pursuing, and it\u2019s, I think, characteristic of what you see now.\u201d</p> <p>Romney secured Trump\u2019s endorsement in February of 2012, even as Trump had aggressively pushed the idea that Obama was a Muslim and born in Kenya. The controversy even saw the reality TV star dispatch a private investigator to Hawaii, where Obama was born, and release an infamous YouTube video calling on the president to release both his birth certificate and college transcripts.</p> <p>Romney\u2019s campaign sought to distance itself from Trump\u2019s comments at the time, although it did not do so forcefully. Four years later, Romney placed himself at the forefront of the so-called #NeverTrump movement by vowing to stop at nothing to prevent his one-time ally from being the Republican nominee.</p> <p>Romney told CNN on Friday he would not vote for Trump even if he is the nominee, and was moved to take action when thinking of what he would tell his grandchildren one day about what he did to try and stop the brash billionaire.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56da14fae4b0fd1a8c7d0b17\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/ben-jacobs\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-03-04T23:16:18.696Z\">11.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><em>The Guardian\u2019s <strong>Ben Jacobs</strong> has more on Ben Carson\u2019s suspension of his presidential campaign:</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f5c2707fe7ff3023c5dd5ea59bfb58a92dfef5ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5c2707fe7ff3023c5dd5ea59bfb58a92dfef5ed/0_0_4096_2732/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ben Carson announces that he is suspending his presidential bid.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ben Carson announces that he is suspending his presidential bid.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The decision marked a fall from grace for Carson, the only Republican candidate besides Donald Trump to have led in multiple national polls since the current frontrunner\u2019s emergence over the summer. Carson has also raised more money than any other Republican candidate for the White House.</p> <p>The mild-mannered neurosurgeon, famed for being the first person to separate twins conjoined at the head, became a prominent political figure in 2013. Then, as the keynote speaker at the National Prayer Breakfast, he launched a furious diatribe against Barack Obama and the Affordable Care Act as the president sat just feet away. The speech turned the 64-year-old African American doctor into a beloved figure among conservatives and fueled his insurgent presidential bid, which began last year.</p> <p>However, Carson, a first time candidate for elected office, was plagued by a disorganized campaign that never built up the political apparatus necessary to win. There was never the political and press operation necessary to mount a winning effort in a campaign plagued by infighting and in which Carson confidant Armstrong Williams played an outsized role and often undermined paid staffers. But many of the issues came from a campaign where even the candidate admitted that his staffers \u201cdidn\u2019t really seem to understand finances\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/04/ben-carson-ends-republican-presidential-campaign\">Ben Carson drops out of presidential race: 'I'm leaving the campaign trail'</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56da105de4b0fd1a8c7d0b13\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/sabrina-siddiqui\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-03-04T22:58:33.431Z\">10.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Marco Rubio on Friday dubbed Donald Trump as the most vulgar person to ever run for president of the United States, <em>writes the Guardian\u2019s <strong>Sabrina Siddiqui:</strong></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"87d9b6702e8a3676cc6581f649d05429700a3d4f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/87d9b6702e8a3676cc6581f649d05429700a3d4f/0_0_4498_3045/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marco Rubio speaks at a campaign rally in Wichita, Kansas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"677\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marco Rubio speaks at a campaign rally in Wichita, Kansas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Sancya/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Speaking on the morning after yet another nasty presidential debate, Rubio lambasted the Republican frontrunner. \u201cDonald Trump has been perhaps the most vulgar - no, I don\u2019t think perhaps - the most vulgar person to ever aspire to the presidency in terms of how he\u2019s carried out his candidacy,\u201d the Florida senator told CNN.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s cut into a lot of these debates and some of the things we are asked about,\u201d Rubio added. \u201cI would love to have a policy debate and I think that is important. We\u2019re talking about the presidency of the United States here.\u201d </p> <p>Rubio and Trump were at the center of several contentious exchanges in the debate, the eleventh of the Republican primary. Rubio insisted it was Trump who was responsible for injecting \u201ca level of vulgarity into the political discourse that we\u2019ve never seen.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt has come to a point, where voters deserve better what they are getting out of these debates and this campaign.\u201d</p> <p>After struggling to secure more than one victory in the nominating contests thus far, Rubio is going all in on his home state of Florida - which will hold its primary on March 15. There, too, he is trailing Trump by double digits but has earned the backing of more than 80 former and current elected Florida officials.</p> <p>On Friday, Rubio was also endorsed by the Orlando Sentinel, the largest newspaper in the central Florida region. </p> <p>\u201cUnlike Trump, Rubio has the knowledge and judgment to be president,\u201d the paper\u2019s editorial board wrote in an op-ed that was nothing short of scathing in its assessment of Trump.</p> <p>\u201cWhere to begin on Trump\u2019s judgment? His idea of political discourse is hurling or tweeting insults at anyone who dares question him,\u201d the board wrote. \u201cHe has maligned Mexican immigrants and Muslims. He has mocked people with disabilities and prisoners of war. He has disparaged and degraded women.\u201d</p> <p>The Orlando Sentinel also lent its support to Rubio in his long-shot 2010 Senate bid. While acknowledging in its 2016 endorsement that it did not agree with Rubio on many issues - namely his hardline stance against abortion - the paper contended that the fresh-faced senator remained \u201cthe best hope\u201d of the remaining Republican candidates.</p> <p>The Miami Herald, the most widely circulated newspaper in Rubio\u2019s hometown of south Florida, gave the senator its stamp of approval earlier this week.</p> <p>Florida is now shaping up to be a do-or-die moment for Rubio\u2019s presidential ambitions. But while Governor John Kasich has pledged to bow out of the race if he loses his home state of Ohio, also holding its primary on March 15, Rubio declined to do the same.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to win Florida,\u201d he told reporters while campaigning in Kansas on Friday. \u201cWe\u2019re very confident about that. We\u2019re prepared for a campaign that goes beyond Florida, as well.\u201d</p> <p>Despite his projection of confidence, Rubio acknowledged the contest would be close, \u201cespecially with something like Donald Trump going on and the amount of national attention he\u2019s gotten.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56da0f07e4b0a02aed206113\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-03-04T22:42:13.482Z\">10.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <h2>Ben Carson, on last night\u2019s debate:</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You would\u2019ve thought it was Netflix.

Beck makes clear there are \u201cmoderate Muslims\u201d, though he writes that that sounds \u201coverly political correct\u201d. His book mostly focuses on \u201cthe true origins of Islamic extremism as well as the deadly theological motivations behind these agencies of destruction\u201d. If you\u2019re looking for a nice, relaxing beach read for the summer \u2026 this probably isn\u2019t it.</p> <h2><strong>Rush Revere and the First Patriots, by Rush Limbaugh</strong></h2> <p>There is no better way to learn American history than through a time-travelling Rush Limbaugh and a talking horse named Liberty. In this tale, teacher Rush Revere takes Liberty and a group of children back to the eve of the American revolution.

Those core objections included that \u201chis embrace of the expansive use of torture is inexcusable.\u201d </p> <p>The letter pointed up the question of whether the military would or could follow potential extra-legal orders made by a hypothetical president Trump to, say, torture a detainee, or kill the family of a suspected terrorists without going through the secret process they use now to claim it\u2019s legal. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ad3d6b08b10d7b8a9f84d6c1eaedcee965d75d5d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad3d6b08b10d7b8a9f84d6c1eaedcee965d75d5d/0_180_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"He\u2019s flexible.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">He\u2019s flexible.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlos Barria/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The question of whether or how the military could follow a President Trump\u2019s orders came up at the debate last night. Trump \u2013 dare we say arrogantly \u2013 said he was a great leader and \u201cfrankly, when I say they\u2019ll do as I tell them, they\u2019ll do as I tell them.\u201d He also said, </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>They won\u2019t refuse. They\u2019re not going to refuse me. Believe me.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>and</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m a leader. If I say do it, they\u2019re going to do it, that\u2019s what leadership is about.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>But now, the Wall Street Journal reports, Trump has reversed that position. He would not order the military to do illegal things with the expectation that they would break the law to follow his orders after all, Trump <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-reverses-his-stance-on-torture-1457116559\">said in a statement</a> to the WSJ:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Mr. Trump, in a statement to The Wall Street Journal, said he would \u201cuse every legal power that I have to stop these terrorist enemies. I do, however, understand that the United States is bound by laws and treaties and I will not order our military or other officials to violate those laws and will seek their advice on such matters. I will not order a military officer to disobey the law. It is clear that as president I will be bound by laws just like all Americans and I will meet those responsibilities.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>The jarring reversal might seem bad enough, but it looks even worse given that Trump\u2019s flip-flops were a major theme of last night\u2019s debate and a major point of attack for his rivals. Fox News host Megyn Kelly even <a

href=\"http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/nj/2015/2/27/cpac-straw-poll-winners-dont/cpac-port2.png\">won the CPAC straw poll in 2010 and 2011</a>, and his son, libertarian-leaning Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/234211-can-pauls-straw-poll-streak-be-stopped\">won in 2013, 2014 and 2015</a> before entering (and dropping out) of the Republican primary race.</p> <p>But Johnson has a theory about why the younger Paul\u2019s CPAC support didn\u2019t translate on the ground in the Republican race: \u201cAt the end of the day, Rand Paul is a Republican.\u201d He added: \u201cAll sorts of people, all sorts of young people, were showing up in droves to hear what he had to say and that the collective takeaway was \u2018This is just a Republican\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think that most people in this country are Libertarian, they just don\u2019t know it\u201d, he said. \u201cSpeaking with a broad brush stroke, that\u2019s being fiscally responsible \u2013 conservative \u2013 and socially liberal \u2013 let people make decisions that only affect their lives, as long as those decisions don\u2019t adversely affect others.\u201d</p> <p>Johnson knows that he has a hard road ahead to November, especially given the focus of the Republican on undocumented immigrants from Mexico and Central America. \u201cI\u2019ve seen that 30% of Republicans believe that the scourge of the Earth has to do with Mexican immigration\u201d he said, but that didn\u2019t dissuade him from speaking up against the demagoguery he\u2019s seen. </p> <p>\u201cMy voice was out there saying \u2018This is a political boogeyman. It\u2019s made up.\u2019 The benefits of immigration far outweigh the negatives. We\u2019re getting the cream of the crop when it comes to workers from Mexico, and I speak as a border governor.\u201d</p> <p>So what does he think should be the focus of libertarian-leaning and conservative voters? \u201cThe main issue [in this campaign] is government spending \u2013 government\u2019s too big, it tries to do too much, and so it taxes too much \u2013 and the unsustainable debt that we have.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLook\u201d, he said, \u201cisn\u2019t this country about personal choices and freedom and my own life? Freedom gets impacted by government and by the money that the government takes from me that I could be applying to my passions.\u201d</p> <p>It should be a resonant message at CPAC, where a huge banner hangs over the exhibit hall proclaiming \u201c#BigGovSucks\u201d.

It\u2019s been a long week, is what we\u2019re saying. From the suspension of a once-powerful presidential campaign to drama at the Conservative Political Action Conference, here\u2019s a summary of some of today\u2019s more dramatic political news: Jim Webb, a former senator from Virginia and briefly a Democratic presidential candidate, declared on TV this morning that he would not vote for Hillary Clinton, who\u2019s making a very strong run for the Democratic nomination. (But he might vote for Trump.) Republican national committee chair Reince Priebus, onstage at CPAC, said that he\u2019s \u201c85-90% sure\u201d there won\u2019t be a contested convention this year, although if Florida senator Marco Rubio has anything to say about it... Donald Trump\u2019s campaign announced that the billionaire frontrunner for the Republican nomination would not attend the Conservative Political Action Conference in Fort Washington, Maryland, and would instead stick around Wichita, Kansas, for a rally prior to the caucuses there on Saturday. Protests were being openly planned for Trump\u2019s speech in front of the group, which he has courted assiduously for the past five years. In the statement released by the campaign, Trump\u2019s communications team misspelled both \u201cWichita\u201d and \u201cKansas.\u201d Two days after prominent Republican national security and military figures published an open letter stating \u201cwe are united in our opposition to a Donald Trump presidency,\u201d in large part due to his stance on torture and war crimes, Trump reversed that position in a statement to the Wall Street Journal, saying that he would not order members of the military to break the law. Speaking of CPAC, retired pediatric neurosurgeon Ben Carson officially suspended his campaign for the Republican nomination in a speech at the conference, calling his candidacy \u201can experience that I will never forget.\u201d Carson did not endorse any remaining candidates for his party\u2019s nomination, but promised that \u201cI will still continue to be heavily involved in trying to save our nation.\u201d That\u2019s it from the Guardian\u2019s liveblog desk in New York - tune in tomorrow for our coverage of the Republican and Democratic caucuses in Kansas and primaries in Louisiana, Democratic caucuses in Nebraska and the Republican caucuses in Maine and Kentucky - and on Sunday for our coverage of the Democratic caucus in Maine and Republican primary in Puerto Rico. Plus the Democratic presidential primary debate on Sunday night in Flint, Michigan. Until then... As conservatives gathered in Maryland for the Conservative Political Action Conference, the Guardian asked attendees to rate the Republican frontrunner on a scale of Bernie Sanders to Rick Santorum in terms of conservatism \u2013 with mixed results. The conference, which is one of the biggest in the Republican calendar, featured speeches from presidential candidates Ted Cruz, John Kasich and Ben Carson. When Mitt Romney delivered a scathing speech against Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy on Thursday, many were quick to point out that the former Republican presidential nominee courted the business mogul\u2019s endorsement in 2012 - even as Trump pushed the conspiracy that Barack Obama was born in Kenya. Defending himself on Friday, Romney insisted Trump\u2019s birtherism against Obama was \u201cvery different\u201d than what the Republican frontrunner is saying today. \u201cI think that\u2019s very different than calling Mexicans rapists, than saying Muslims are not going to be allowed into the country as immigrants, than mocking a disabled reporter, than going after women and saying, \u2018Oh, she asks tough questions because she was in her menstrual cycle,\u2019\u201d Romney told CNN in an interview. \u201cThis is highly offensive,\u201d he added. Pressed on the fact that it was similarly offensive to raise doubts over Obama\u2019s birthplace, Romney continued to downplay Trump\u2019s fixation with the president\u2019s birth certificate. \u201cHe had a belief President Obama wasn\u2019t born in this country. I disagreed with him,\u201d Romney said. \u201cThere are political views where we\u2019re going to disagree. But what he has said during this campaign - that George W. Bush is a liar, that John McCain isn\u2019t a hero - he said some things that are completely, totally outrageous.\u201d CNN\u2019s Gloria Borger continued to prod Romney further, pointing out that Obama would find it offensive that Trump insisted he wasn\u2019t born in the US. Romney again dismissed it as a futile exercise. \u201cThe funny thing about Donald Trump\u2019s whole birther thing is, it would have made no difference - Barack Obama\u2019s mother was American,\u201d Romney said. \u201cIt was a whole ridiculous thing that Donald Trump was pursuing, and it\u2019s, I think, characteristic of what you see now.\u201d Romney secured Trump\u2019s endorsement in February of 2012, even as Trump had aggressively pushed the idea that Obama was a Muslim and born in Kenya. The controversy even saw the reality TV star dispatch a private investigator to Hawaii, where Obama was born, and release an infamous YouTube video calling on the president to release both his birth certificate and college transcripts. Romney\u2019s campaign sought to distance itself from Trump\u2019s comments at the time, although it did not do so forcefully. Four years later, Romney placed himself at the forefront of the so-called #NeverTrump movement by vowing to stop at nothing to prevent his one-time ally from being the Republican nominee. Romney told CNN on Friday he would not vote for Trump even if he is the nominee, and was moved to take action when thinking of what he would tell his grandchildren one day about what he did to try and stop the brash billionaire. The Guardian\u2019s Ben Jacobs has more on Ben Carson\u2019s suspension of his presidential campaign: The decision marked a fall from grace for Carson, the only Republican candidate besides Donald Trump to have led in multiple national polls since the current frontrunner\u2019s emergence over the summer. Carson has also raised more money than any other Republican candidate for the White House. The mild-mannered neurosurgeon, famed for being the first person to separate twins conjoined at the head, became a prominent political figure in 2013. Then, as the keynote speaker at the National Prayer Breakfast, he launched a furious diatribe against Barack Obama and the Affordable Care Act as the president sat just feet away. The speech turned the 64-year-old African American doctor into a beloved figure among conservatives and fueled his insurgent presidential bid, which began last year. However, Carson, a first time candidate for elected office, was plagued by a disorganized campaign that never built up the political apparatus necessary to win. There was never the political and press operation necessary to mount a winning effort in a campaign plagued by infighting and in which Carson confidant Armstrong Williams played an outsized role and often undermined paid staffers. But many of the issues came from a campaign where even the candidate admitted that his staffers \u201cdidn\u2019t really seem to understand finances\u201d. Marco Rubio on Friday dubbed Donald Trump as the most vulgar person to ever run for president of the United States, writes the Guardian\u2019s Sabrina Siddiqui: Speaking on the morning after yet another nasty presidential debate, Rubio lambasted the Republican frontrunner. \u201cDonald Trump has been perhaps the most vulgar - no, I don\u2019t think perhaps - the most vulgar person to ever aspire to the presidency in terms of how he\u2019s carried out his candidacy,\u201d the Florida senator told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s cut into a lot of these debates and some of the things we are asked about,\u201d Rubio added. \u201cI would love to have a policy debate and I think that is important. We\u2019re talking about the presidency of the United States here.\u201d Rubio and Trump were at the center of several contentious exchanges in the debate, the eleventh of the Republican primary. Rubio insisted it was Trump who was responsible for injecting \u201ca level of vulgarity into the political discourse that we\u2019ve never seen.\u201d \u201cIt has come to a point, where voters deserve better what they are getting out of these debates and this campaign.\u201d After struggling to secure more than one victory in the nominating contests thus far, Rubio is going all in on his home state of Florida - which will hold its primary on March 15. There, too, he is trailing Trump by double digits but has earned the backing of more than 80 former and current elected Florida officials. On Friday, Rubio was also endorsed by the Orlando Sentinel, the largest newspaper in the central Florida region. \u201cUnlike Trump, Rubio has the knowledge and judgment to be president,\u201d the paper\u2019s editorial board wrote in an op-ed that was nothing short of scathing in its assessment of Trump. \u201cWhere to begin on Trump\u2019s judgment? His idea of political discourse is hurling or tweeting insults at anyone who dares question him,\u201d the board wrote. \u201cHe has maligned Mexican immigrants and Muslims. He has mocked people with disabilities and prisoners of war. He has disparaged and degraded women.\u201d The Orlando Sentinel also lent its support to Rubio in his long-shot 2010 Senate bid. While acknowledging in its 2016 endorsement that it did not agree with Rubio on many issues - namely his hardline stance against abortion - the paper contended that the fresh-faced senator remained \u201cthe best hope\u201d of the remaining Republican candidates. The Miami Herald, the most widely circulated newspaper in Rubio\u2019s hometown of south Florida, gave the senator its stamp of approval earlier this week. Florida is now shaping up to be a do-or-die moment for Rubio\u2019s presidential ambitions. But while Governor John Kasich has pledged to bow out of the race if he loses his home state of Ohio, also holding its primary on March 15, Rubio declined to do the same. \u201cWe\u2019re going to win Florida,\u201d he told reporters while campaigning in Kansas on Friday. \u201cWe\u2019re very confident about that. We\u2019re prepared for a campaign that goes beyond Florida, as well.\u201d Despite his projection of confidence, Rubio acknowledged the contest would be close, \u201cespecially with something like Donald Trump going on and the amount of national attention he\u2019s gotten.\u201d Ben Carson, on last night\u2019s debate: You would\u2019ve thought it was Netflix. It\u2019s kinda funny, but it\u2019s very sad that we\u2019ve reached that point. After officially suspending his campaign for the Republican nomination, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson urged voters to coalesce around a presidential candidate who will \u201cpreserve the greatness of America.\u201d \u201cWe are the ones who will be making the decisions, but in order to do that, we have to become active,\u201d Carson said. \u201cWe must become informed. We cannot allow ourselves to be influenced... by the political class and by the media.\u201d He also gave a warning to members of the political media to be \u201cmore fair\u201d to conservative candidates. \u201cDo not to allow yourselves to be captured by those who are attempting to impose an agenda upon America,\u201d Carson said. \u201cRemember, that you, too, are a part of us. And if the whole country goes over the cliff, you go over with it.\u201d \u201cThis is not about any individual person - this is about us collectively as a nation,\u201d Carson said. Speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Fort Washington, Maryland, retired pediatric neurosurgeon Ben Carson officially suspended his campaign for the Republican nomination, calling his candidacy \u201can experience that I will never forget.\u201d \u201cI am leaving the campaign trail,\u201d he said, to boos, and then a loud wave of applause. \u201cI will still continue to be heavily involved in trying to save our nation. We have to save it.\u201d As for potential presidential candidates for his own endorsement, Carson was cryptic. \u201cYou need to look at how they treat others, and how they treat their family, because that\u2019s how they\u2019re gonna treat the American people,\u201d Carson said. \u201cWhat we need now in America is trickle-down ethics.\u201d After a long riff on the role of the federal government in alleviating poverty, crime rates and \u201ctaking care of the indigent\u201d - \u201cthey need to read the constitution; that is not their jobs\u201d - Carson declared that he will continue to push for conservatives to register and vote for whomever wins the Republican nomination. Carson decried the negative, petty tone of the campaign in recent weeks. \u201cI left that stuff in high school,\u201d Carson said, to loud cheers. Citing his experience as a brain surgeon, Carson declared that pure reaction is something that any animal can do - \u201clizards can do that\u201d - but says only higher-level thinking will help the next president in the White House. Retired pediatric neurosurgeon Ben Carson has begun speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Fort Washington, Maryland, where he is expended to suspend his campaign for the Republican nomination. In his opening remarks, Carson decried the negative, petty tone of the campaign in recent weeks. \u201cI left that stuff in high school,\u201d Carson said, to loud cheers. Citing his experience as a brain surgeon, Carson declared that pure reaction is something that any animal can do - \u201clizards can do that\u201d - but says only higher-level thinking will help the next president in the White House. Ted Cruz has warnedthat a brokered convention would lead to \u201cmanifest revolt\u201d among voters, the Guardian\u2019s Ben Jacobs reports from Fort Washington, Maryland: In a interview with Sean Hannity on Friday at the CPAC conference of conservative activists outside Washington DC, Cruz warned that talk of a brokered convention comes from \u201cthe Washington establishment in a fevered frenzy because all their chosen candidates, all their golden children, the voters keep rejecting.\u201d He warned there was a \u201cmaster plan\u201d for \u201cDC power brokers . . .[to] drop someone in who is exactly to the liking of the Washington establishment.\u201d He added, \u201cif that happens there will be manifest revolt on our hands across the country.\u201d Cruz, who has won four of the first fifteen nominating contests, argued \u201cif you want to beat Donald Trump, this is how you do it, you beat Donald Trump with the voters.\u201d The Texas senator\u2019s statements came just over an hour after rival John Kasich said he expected there to be a brokered convention. Mitt Romney, the GOP\u2019s nominee in 2012, also stoked talk of a brokered convention on Thursday, when he suggested voters back whichever rival to Trump was strongest in their states. The Texas senator made the comments to an adoring audience, which repeatedly stood and gave him standing ovations. Before being interviewed by Hannity, Cruz gave an abbreviated version of his stump speech where he took repeated shots at Donald Trump\u2019s decision to pull out of the event, Cruz jibed \u201cSo Donald Trump is skipping CPAC. I think someone told him Megyn Kelly I going to be here.\u201d The Texas senator who has been vocally criticizing Trump for the past two months then elevated his rhetoric. \u201cOr even worse, he was told there are conservatives going to be here, or even worse libertarians going to be here or even worse young people going to be here,\u201d Cruz said as the crowd built to a crescendo of applause. The US supreme court has temporarily blocked a Louisiana law imposing regulations on doctors who perform abortions in a move that would allow two of the state\u2019s four clinics to reopen. In a brief order, the court granted a request by abortion providers seeking to reinstate a lower-court injunction that blocked the law, which required doctors to obtain a formal affiliation with a local hospital. The order noted that one of the eight justices, conservative Clarence Thomas, said he would have denied the application. The order said the court\u2019s action was in line with its decision in June to temporarily block part of a Texas abortion law that was challenged by abortion providers in a high-profile case. The eight justices heard oral arguments in that case on Wednesday. The Louisiana law mandates that physicians who perform abortions have \u201cadmitting privileges\u201d at a hospital within 30 miles (48 km) of the facility where abortions are performed. The regulation matches one in the Texas law. \u201cGod bless CPAC!\u201d Texas senator Ted Cruz took to the main stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Maryland and immediately launched into a critique of a fellow Republican presidential candidate who didn\u2019t show up to the event: billionaire frontrunner Donald Trump. \u201cI think somebody told him Megyn Kelly was gonna be here,\u201d joked Cruz, \u201cor even worse, he was told that there were conservatives that were gonna be here; or even worse, he was told that there was gonna libertarians who were gonna be here; or even worse he was told there were gonna be young people here!\u201d the senator said, to mixed applause and laughter. He was immediately interrupted by a small but vocal \u201cTrump! Trump! Trump!\u201d chant, which itself was interrupted by a chorus of boos from the rest of the audience. Florida senator Marco Rubio has further \u201cclarified\u201d his #NeverTrump stance. On the heels of conceding in last night\u2019s debate that he would vote for whichever candidate wins the nomination, even Donald Trump, Rubio elaborated on the subject in a radio interview today. \u201cFor me, I\u2019m never voting for Donald Trump in the Republican primary,\u201d Rubio told Kentucky Sports Radio. \u201cThat\u2019s the point that I was making.\u201d Which technically means that Rubio doesn\u2019t plan on voting for Trump in the upcoming winner-take-all Florida Republican primary on March 15. So he\u2019s got that going for him, which is nice. But what\u2019s he going to do with all of the #NeverTrump swag his campaign is selling? After being repeatedly interrupted by protesters at a rally in Cadillac, Michigan, Republican frontrunner Donald Trump called on his security officers to arrest one of the protesters for his \u201cfilthy, dirty mouth.\u201d The protester had broken out into a chant that involved Trump\u2019s delayed disavowal of the endorsement of David Duke, a former grand wizard in the Ku Klux Klan, which prompted Trump to interrupt his speech and call for the man\u2019s arrest. \u201cGet that guy out of here. Get him out of here!\u201d shouted Trump, Trump, who yesterday said that he could have gotten former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney to \u201cget down on [his] knees\u201d in exchange for Trump\u2019s endorsement and defended the size of his genitals during a presidential debate on Fox News. \u201cI think he should be arrested. Arrest him for what he just did and for the fresh mouth he\u2019s got. I don\u2019t want to give any recommendations, officer, but I would arrest him for a filthy, dirty mouth. And then we\u2019ll see what his mommy and daddy say when they have to go and bail him out.\u201d Whether it\u2019s Barack Obama\u2019s hereditary communism, the nefarious Fed or the prospect of being \u201cablaze for God\u201d, CPAC\u2019s bookstore has it all, reports the Guardian\u2019s Ben Jacobs: The Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) is a conservative carnival, attended by presidential hopefuls, students and guys who dress up in colonial-era outfits. One perennial feature is the bookstore, which sells fringe texts and conservative staples. For those looking for some spring-break reading, here is a selection of some of the more intriguing books available this year. Ablaze For God, by Wesley L Duewel Photograph: Ben Jacobs for the Guardian A religious book, which tries to teach people how they too can be \u201cAblaze for God\u201d. It turns out that \u201cyour personality [is] so suffused with the presence and beauty of the Lord that others instinctively sense that God is with you!\u201d Like Billy Joel, the text makes clear: \u201cWe didn\u2019t start the fire, it was always burning since the world\u2019s been turning.\u201d It Is About Islam, by Glenn Beck Islam is the world\u2019s second-largest religion and radio host Glenn Beck owns George Washington\u2019s copy of Don Quixote so, of course, he\u2019s an expert on the subject. Beck makes clear there are \u201cmoderate Muslims\u201d, though he writes that that sounds \u201coverly political correct\u201d. His book mostly focuses on \u201cthe true origins of Islamic extremism as well as the deadly theological motivations behind these agencies of destruction\u201d. If you\u2019re looking for a nice, relaxing beach read for the summer \u2026 this probably isn\u2019t it. Rush Revere and the First Patriots, by Rush Limbaugh There is no better way to learn American history than through a time-travelling Rush Limbaugh and a talking horse named Liberty. In this tale, teacher Rush Revere takes Liberty and a group of children back to the eve of the American revolution. They go on a series of adventures. There\u2019s a rumble brewing in Traverse City, Michigan... Republican leaders are fighting to restore confidence in their process for picking a presidential nominee after an establishment backlash against Donald Trump and another insult-strewn television debate left the party facing unprecedented, and possibly existential, challenges to its unity, reports the Guardian\u2019s Dan Roberts, Ben Jacobs and Sabrina Siddiqui: \u201cWe are in territory that our party hasn\u2019t seen,\u201d conceded Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee (RNC), at a meeting of conservative activists gathered outside Washington, when he was asked what would happen if there was no clear winner by the time of this summer\u2019s GOP convention. Priebus insisted the chances of the race needing to be decided by a so-called \u201cbrokered convention\u201d \u2013 at which delegates would be freed from voting in line with state primary election results \u2013 were just 10-15%, but discussion of an apparent attempt by former nominee Mitt Romney to engineer such a scenario was met with loud boos from the crowd at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). Though strongly supportive of Texas senator Ted Cruz and mostly suspicious of Trump, the audience at CPAC appeared even more skeptical of any attempt to rig the nomination process by party leaders in Washington. \u201cThere is no way that the people are not going to decide,\u201d a defensive Priebus told CPAC. \u201cWhoever the nominee is of our party, they are going to get the full backing and 100% support of the Republican party.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Ben Jacobs is watching CPAC and Kasich, who is stoked at the prospect of a brokered convention (maybe because he has only 25 delegates by most counts so far): Cruz to pro-Sanders protesters: \u2018you are only helping Wall Street\u2019 - video Ohio governor John Kasich is speaking at CPAC, and you may watch him from the comfort of your own home, or office, or home office, or wired beachview cabana, here: This will take some explaining. Two days ago prominent Republican national security and military figures published an open letter stating \u201cwe are united in our opposition to a Donald Trump presidency\u201d and \u201cobligated to state our core objections clearly\u201d. Those core objections included that \u201chis embrace of the expansive use of torture is inexcusable.\u201d The letter pointed up the question of whether the military would or could follow potential extra-legal orders made by a hypothetical president Trump to, say, torture a detainee, or kill the family of a suspected terrorists without going through the secret process they use now to claim it\u2019s legal. The question of whether or how the military could follow a President Trump\u2019s orders came up at the debate last night. Trump \u2013 dare we say arrogantly \u2013 said he was a great leader and \u201cfrankly, when I say they\u2019ll do as I tell them, they\u2019ll do as I tell them.\u201d He also said, They won\u2019t refuse. They\u2019re not going to refuse me. Believe me.\u201d and I\u2019m a leader. If I say do it, they\u2019re going to do it, that\u2019s what leadership is about.\u201d But now, the Wall Street Journal reports, Trump has reversed that position. He would not order the military to do illegal things with the expectation that they would break the law to follow his orders after all, Trump said in a statement to the WSJ: Mr. Trump, in a statement to The Wall Street Journal, said he would \u201cuse every legal power that I have to stop these terrorist enemies. I do, however, understand that the United States is bound by laws and treaties and I will not order our military or other officials to violate those laws and will seek their advice on such matters. I will not order a military officer to disobey the law. It is clear that as president I will be bound by laws just like all Americans and I will meet those responsibilities.\u201d The jarring reversal might seem bad enough, but it looks even worse given that Trump\u2019s flip-flops were a major theme of last night\u2019s debate and a major point of attack for his rivals. Fox News host Megyn Kelly even played three video clips showing Trump blatantly reversing himself on the war in Afghanistan, Syrian refugees and on Bush\u2019s lying \u2013 or not \u2013 to get the US into the Iraq war. Trump defended himself last night by saying like all successful people he\u2019s \u201cflexible.\u201d Read more here: Video: CPAC attendees put Donald Trump in his place (on our homemade spectrum) As conservatives have begun to openly speculate (including from the stage at CPAC) about someone making a third party run for president if Donald Trumps wins the Republican nomination, the candidate for the existing third party \u2013 former New Mexico governor and former Republican Gary Johnson, the libertarian candidate for president \u2013 said \u201cI\u2019m glad to have had the opportunity to make my pitch\u201d to the conservative attendees. \u201cI think that Donald Trump fully alienates more than half of Republicans\u201d he said. CPAC has long been considered fertile ground for libertarian conservatives: libertarian-leaning Texas Congressman Ron Paul won the CPAC straw poll in 2010 and 2011, and his son, libertarian-leaning Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, won in 2013, 2014 and 2015 before entering (and dropping out) of the Republican primary race. But Johnson has a theory about why the younger Paul\u2019s CPAC support didn\u2019t translate on the ground in the Republican race: \u201cAt the end of the day, Rand Paul is a Republican.\u201d He added: \u201cAll sorts of people, all sorts of young people, were showing up in droves to hear what he had to say and that the collective takeaway was \u2018This is just a Republican\u2019.\u201d \u201cI think that most people in this country are Libertarian, they just don\u2019t know it\u201d, he said. \u201cSpeaking with a broad brush stroke, that\u2019s being fiscally responsible \u2013 conservative \u2013 and socially liberal \u2013 let people make decisions that only affect their lives, as long as those decisions don\u2019t adversely affect others.\u201d Johnson knows that he has a hard road ahead to November, especially given the focus of the Republican on undocumented immigrants from Mexico and Central America. \u201cI\u2019ve seen that 30% of Republicans believe that the scourge of the Earth has to do with Mexican immigration\u201d he said, but that didn\u2019t dissuade him from speaking up against the demagoguery he\u2019s seen. \u201cMy voice was out there saying \u2018This is a political boogeyman. It\u2019s made up.\u2019 The benefits of immigration far outweigh the negatives. We\u2019re getting the cream of the crop when it comes to workers from Mexico, and I speak as a border governor.\u201d So what does he think should be the focus of libertarian-leaning and conservative voters? \u201cThe main issue [in this campaign] is government spending \u2013 government\u2019s too big, it tries to do too much, and so it taxes too much \u2013 and the unsustainable debt that we have.\u201d \u201cLook\u201d, he said, \u201cisn\u2019t this country about personal choices and freedom and my own life? Freedom gets impacted by government and by the money that the government takes from me that I could be applying to my passions.\u201d It should be a resonant message at CPAC, where a huge banner hangs over the exhibit hall proclaiming \u201c#BigGovSucks\u201d. But, like everything else, it\u2019ll probably get lost in all the back and forth over what to do about Donald Trump. Do tell: Liz Mair is an accomplished Republican campaign communications type. She was dropped from the Scott Walker campaign this cycle for tweeting ill of Iowans. Well THAT was quick. Retired neurosurgeon and retiring presidential candidate Ben Carson plans to announce at CPAC this afternoon that he\u2019s taken a job as chairman of a Christian get-out-the-vote group called My Faith Votes. Politico flags a Carson statement on the group\u2019s web site: Nothing is more important to me than my personal faith, and it is my faith that motivated me to be involved in the political process to begin with. I believe Christians in this country can easily determine the next president of the United States and all other national and local leaders, should they simply show up at the polls. When we do vote, We The People will once again solidify our commitment to the Judeo-Christian values upon which our nation was founded. Carson is already on their web site described as \u201cnational chairman\u201d: For now, Carson\u2019s still a candidate, meaning he still has secret service protection \u2013 meaning CPAC has just become a pedestrian traffic snarl of doom: What\u2019s happening in the comments? Dissecting Trump ditching CPAC Cheers for Trudeau Who won the debate? \u2013 Trump edition Marco Rubio is heading to Puerto Rico on Saturday, the Guardian\u2019s Sabrina Siddiqui reports. Sounds like a good idea to us: The influential producer businessman and activist endorses Hillary Clinton: Reince Priebus is so much as guaranteeing there won\u2019t be a brokered convention in July. But the Cleveland cops know which way the wind blows. The city plans to buy 2,000 riot-control suits with collapsible batons for the occasion, the AP says, picking up on a Cleveland.com report. The city posted a notice this week seeking providers for that gear: The request comes as Cleveland has ramped up its public process to spend the $50 million federal security grant for the event. The federal money was approved by Congress in December. Bid paperwork shows the city also wants to buy more than 300 sets of long-sleeve jackets, gloves and shin guards. That equipment would serve as riot-control gear for police officers riding bicycles. The city previously sought to buy 300 bicycles, 15 motorcycles, 25 sets of tactical armor and enough 3.5-foot-high interlocking steel barriers to cover about 3 miles. The city is slated to have thousands of police officers on hand for the convention, which is expected to draw 50,000 visitors. Can he do that? That\u2019s like crossing Roger Ailes or refusing to commit early not to run as an independent or assessing John McCain as a wimp or saying endorsements don\u2019t matter. So apparently... yes. Here\u2019s a statement from the Trump campaign announcing he\u2019ll stick around Kansas for a rally prior to the caucuses Saturday and then fly to Florida instead of CPAC-ing: The Donald J. Trump for President Campaign has just announced it will be in Witchita*, Kanasas** for a major rally on Saturday prior to Caucus. He will also be speaking at the Kansas Caucus and then departing for Orlando, Florida and a crowd of approximately 20,000 people or more. Because of this, he will not be able to speak at CPAC as he has done for many consecutive years. Mr. Trump would like to thank Matt Schlapp and all of the executives at CPAC and looks forward to returning to next year, hopefully as President of the United States. * The city is spelled Wichita. Is this the misstep that will sink Trump? H/T @BENCJACOBS ** The state is spelled Kansas. We give up. The CPAC organizers are really not happy. Whoever uploaded this to YouTube misspelled Wichita, too. Could Donald Trump secretly be behind the \u201cToni Davey\u201d YouTube account? If so he\u2019s heavy into vintage vinyl. Looks like we\u2019re going to need a second wall. Canadian premier Justin Trudeau has given an interview to 60 Minutes and he told them \u201cit might be nice if [Americans] paid a little more attention to the world.\u201d He apparently didn\u2019t sit through the trade policy or Russia policy sections of last night\u2019s debate. Must of tuned out after the penis part. \u201cHaving a little more of an awareness of what\u2019s going on in the rest of the world, I think is, is what many Canadians would hope for Americans,\u201d Trudeau said in a transcript released to The Associated Press on Thursday. He\u2019s due for a state visit to Washington on 10 March, a week from yesterday. Trudeau said Canadians must be aware of at least one other country, the United States, because of its importance. \u201cI think we sometimes like to think that, you know, Americans will pay attention to us from time to time, too,\u201d he said. Read the full report here. Playing for classical American heroic appeal, in a black-and-white image via Rubio\u2019s press secretary. The photography\u2019s so good it makes deathly unpopular governor Sam Brownback standing next to Rubio look like Reagan (squint!): Last night\u2019s Republican debate was significantly more widely watched than the last few, coming in as the fourth-highest-rated primary debate on record, CNN reports: The two-hour debate averaged a 11.6 household rating in Nielsen\u2019s metered markets -- a higher rating than practically everything else on television this week. Household ratings are an indication of how many American homes tuned in. Actual viewership numbers will be released later on Friday. For perspective: Fox\u2019s January 28 debate -- the one Trump snubbed -- had an 8.4 household rating. Read the full piece here. \u201cOK, it\u2019s amazing right now with Isis, I tell you what? I don\u2019t want them to vote, the worst very social people. I love me.\u201d Donald Trump may be a \u201creally smart person\u201d by his own estimation, but his speeches are now fuelling a really smart Twitter bot, which uses artificial-intelligence technology to copy the Republican frontrunner. The quote above comes from \u201cDeep Drumpf\u201d rather than the real Trump, with the account running on algorithms created at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab. Marco Rubio is holding a rally at Topeka regional airport in Kansas, which caucuses on Saturday. Shouldn\u2019t he be in Florida? Here\u2019s a live stream if you\u2019d like to watch: Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson is scheduled to speak this afternoon at CPAC, where he is expected to make it official that he is suspending his campaign. Carson failed to compete in any state, but he led the field in one significant respect: he raised more money than any of his Republican rivals \u2013 $58 million since he began his bid last May, by the AP\u2019s tally. There\u2019s a big \u201cbut\u201d: But Carson\u2019s campaign burned through much more of that money on fundraising and consultants than on mass media advertising, on-the-ground employees and other things that could have swayed voters, an Associated Press review of his campaign finance reports found. Carson\u2019s campaign is an extreme example of the big-money business of presidential politics. The candidate himself, a soft-spoken retired Baltimore neurosurgeon, has wondered aloud whether his campaign aides took advantage of him. He did so in an interview with CNN last week and again Thursday in a Yahoo News interview with Katie Couric, who questioned Carson on whether his campaign had spent so much on fundraising to gather a list of donors for a future business venture. \u201cMistakes were made,\u201d Carson said. \u201cWe probably had the wrong team in place, people who probably had different objectives than I did. And once we discovered that and rectified it, the situation changed dramatically.\u201d Some people who worked with Carson\u2019s presidential campaign are positioned to continue profiting from his elevated profile even after he officially ends his bid. Read the full piece here. Republican national committee chair Reince Priebus, onstage at CPAC, says he\u2019s \u201c85-90% sure\u201d there won\u2019t be a contested convention this year. A national convention at which a nominee is chosen through truly competitive rounds of voting, ear-bending, back-patting and who knows what else could result if no one candidate captures the majority of delegates at stake in the run-up to the convention. It\u2019s possible. Fox News guy Sean Hannity is interviewing Priebus, trying to get him to take a stand against a contested convention. Trying to get Reince Priebus to take a stand is implicitly heroic. Jim Webb, the brief Democratic presidential candidate, former senator from Virginia, decorated combat veteran and Emmy-winning journalist, declared on TV this morning that he would not vote for Hillary Clinton, who\u2019s making a very strong run for the Democratic nomination. But he might vote for Trump, Webb said. \u201cI would not vote for Hillary Clinton,\u201d Webb said on MSBNC. And Trump? \u201cI\u2019m not sure yet,\u201d Webb said. \u201cI don\u2019t know who I\u2019m going to vote for.\u201d Webb went on to explain, \u201cIf you\u2019re voting for Hillary Clinton, you\u2019re going to be getting the same thing,\u201d wheres if you vote for Trump, you might get something \u201cvery good or very bad\u201d but who knows? Update: good to point out: Webb has dabbled as an independent and was a Reagan appointee before branding himself as a Democrat in 2006: See, and then every once in awhile he speaks daylight perfect sense. \u201cIn 1972, a few weeks into my first job as a reporter at the Burlington Free Press, I was sent to check out reports of a demonstration in one of the city\u2019s poorer neighborhoods,\u201d writes Fred Bayles for the Guardian: The scene was somewhat chaotic. Three or four people were highly exercised about some housing-related issue, but it was hard to get past the rhetoric to understand the details. To add to my rookie confusion, the group was led by a wild-haired, wild-eyed 30-something with an incongruent Brooklyn accent. I took notes and retreated to the newsroom. \u201cWho is this guy ... Bernard Sanders?\u201d I asked the city editor, reading from my notebook. He took on the expression of a man who had just bit into a lemon. \u201cOh, Bernie,\u201d he said. \u201cForget it. No story.\u201d He sent me back to my desk, where I took obits from LaVigne\u2019s funeral home for the rest of my shift. More than 40 years later, that first Bernie experience \u2013 and the others that followed \u2013 feels like today. Sanders has physically aged; the dark curly hair is straighter and white, the voice softer, the tone less strident. But his message has remained remarkably consistent for a former neighborhood rabble-rouser who became a US senator and a serious presidential candidate. Read the full piece here. \u201cImagine, if it\u2019s possible, that you are a serious American conservative,\u201d begins the Guardian\u2019s Megan Carpentier, encamped in Maryland at the conservative political action conference: You feel strongly about the right to life, perhaps; you certainly believe in a smaller, less expensive government; you hate Obamacare, not because it offers many previously-uninsured Americans a way to avoid crippling debt and bankruptcy, but because it punishes anyone who, in the American way, chooses to be uninsured. After more than seven years of Barack Obama in the White House, you want a serious statesman who represents conservative principles like limited government and free market capitalism. The Republican debate on Thursday night between the final four candidates who could possibly capture the party\u2019s presidential nomination, numerically speaking, was, for many remaining primary voters, the last possible opportunity to look at each candidate\u2019s policies and demeanor and begin to make a choice for who they might want representing their party \u2013 their ideas \u2013 to the rest of the nation and the world in November and hopefully beyond. Instead, the debate managed to focus, albeit briefly, on the (alleged) size of Donald Trump\u2019s penis, and nearly every conservative news site covered that \u201cbreaking\u201d news. (Former Republican congressman and current MSNBC morning show host Joe Scarborough even tweeted about it, with pearls firmly clutched.) Read the full piece here. And Update: for further reading: Hello, and welcome to our live-wire coverage of the 2016 race for the White House. Did you see last night\u2019s Republican debate? Senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz strapped on their flamethrowers to try and scorch frontrunner Donald Trump, while token adult in the room John Kasich patiently waited his turn and told people that when they got to know him they\u2019d vote for him. Here\u2019s where to read all about it: There was enough superficial action in the presidential race yesterday (not to be confused with actual voting or vote-counting) \u2013 Mitt Romney calling Trump a burgeoning fascist, Trump replying that Romney begged him for a 2012 endorsement, old Romney campaign hands piling on to say it was Trump who was doing the begging \u2013 that it was possible to lose sight of the events unfolding at the Gaylord National Harbor Hotel in Maryland, where the right has gathered for the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). The Guardian\u2019s Megan Carpentier, Dan Roberts and Ben Jacobs are there for the fun: Speaking of Romney, he\u2019s been on the Today show this morning and kind of gently pushed back against a report yesterday that his advisers are exploring what it might mean to navigate a contested national convention to select a presidential nominee. CNN reported that \u201cimplicit\u201d in the exploration was the possibility that Romney would try to nab the nom. \u201cNo, no, the people who can save this party are Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio or John Kasich,\u201d Romney said, according to a Politico write-up. \u201cThere are no circumstances I can foresee where that would possibly happen.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no question I\u2019m going to do everything within the normal political bounds to make sure we don\u2019t nominate Donald Trump ... After March 15 I think you\u2019ll see it narrow down ... I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if I endorse one of those guys.\u201d \u2022\u2022\u2022 \u201cAsking for a friend\u201d LOL ha Who do you think won the debate last night? Or are you over it already? Thanks for reading and weigh in in the comments please!",

A party torn by Trump\u2019s unstoppable rise Trump said he had to spend more time in Kansas, one of five states to vote on Saturday, and Florida, where he\u2019s hoping to wipe the floor with Marco Rubio. \u201cWe are in territory that our party hasn\u2019t seen,\u201d said Republican national committee chair Reince Priebus. But he was \u201c85%-90% sure\u201d the party would elect a nominee cleanly. Reassuring! Republicans are supposed to elevate a nominee at a convention in July in Cleveland. On Friday, the city\u2019s police force announced plans to buy 2,000 riot-control suits with collapsible batons and shin guards. Republican hopeful John Kasich predicted a chaotic convention with no foretold nominee. \u201cCan you think of anything cooler than a convention?\u201d he said. With only 25 delegates so far, he would say that. The Republican sturm und drang grew after a poisonously contentious debate showdown in Detroit a night earlier. Trump called his rivals \u201clittle Marco\u201d and \u201clyin\u2019 Ted\u201d and guaranteed his penis was ample. Talk of Trump junk a disservice to voters Impresario and activist Russell Simmons endorsed Hillary Clinton for president, saying Bernie Sanders was \u201coverstating what he can deliver to underserved communities\u201d. It seems like only yesterday that Ben Carson was actively running for president. In fact it was three days ago. But Carson landed well: he\u2019s the new head of a Christian get-out-the-vote group. \u201cThis time it\u2019s life and death,\u201d he said. After insisting at the debate that the military would not hesitate to carry out orders he might give as president \u2013 even orders to break torture laws \u2013 Trump backpedaled. I do, however, understand that the United States is bound by laws and treaties and I will not order our military or other officials to violate those laws and will seek their advice on such matters. \u2013Donald J Trump, in an about-face \u201cHaving a little more of an awareness of what\u2019s going on in the rest of the world, I think is, is what many Canadians would hope for Americans,\u201d Canadian PM Justin Trudeau said.

We gave you the great Samantha Bee and John (\u201cprivate wealth and public squalor\u201d) Kenneth Galbraith, so give us Jon Stewart and Noam Chomsky (we\u2019ll take Calgary-born Cruz back, sorry about that) and we\u2019re square. But who are we to rub salt in your political wound? We recently recovered from 10 years of rule by a nasty paranoid Conservative named Harper. We\u2019ve since elected a normal, intelligent, kindly human. You, America, will do the same this fall.",

          "body": "<p>Within a few minutes of meeting the actor <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/ellenpage\">Ellen Page</a> near her Los Angeles home, we\u2019re talking about what she enjoys doing around here, which is going surfing with her girlfriend, <a href=\"http://www.samanthathomasart.com\">artist Samantha Thomas</a>. She likes to watch Thomas, the more experienced surfer, examine the waves. Thomas tells her which way to turn, based on movements in the water that Page can\u2019t even see. \u201cParticularly on days where there are onshore winds, so it\u2019s kind of rough, she\u2019ll say, \u2018Oh, a wave\u2019s coming at you, it\u2019s a right, go right\u2019 and I\u2019m just like, \u2018What are you looking at? You can read the ocean like that?\u2019 It\u2019s really hot,\u201d she adds, the excitement in her gentle voice suggesting that she is quietly, but madly, in love.</p> <p>There is nothing hugely remarkable about any of this, especially here in California, except that until February 2014 Page would have been unable to have such a conversation with a journalist. The actor who starred in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/juno\">Juno</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/110886/hard.candy\">Hard Candy</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/134817/whip-it\">Whip It</a>, all films about tough young women who go against the grain, was living a lie. She was pretending to be straight, or at least \u201clying by omission\u201d, as she puts it, intent on fulfilling her acting ambitions without any adverse attention, even though she had been out of the closet with her loved ones for years. But the double life had started to take its toll on her sanity, so she decided, a month before the event, that she would come out during <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/15/ellen-page-comes-out-speech-human-rights-campaign\">a speech at a Las Vegas</a> conference for counsellors of young LGBT people. \u201cI\u2019m here today because I am gay,\u201d she revealed, halfway through <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hlCEIUATzg\">an eight-minute talk</a>, to a standing ovation that began before she had even finished. It was Valentine\u2019s Day.</p> <p>Page was only 26, but had been acting professionally since the age of 10; at 20, she was nominated for an Academy Award for best actress for her role as the eponymous pregnant high-school student in Juno. The gulf between her public and private lives had been growing long enough. \u201cI felt, let\u2019s just please be done with this chapter of discomfort and sadness and anxiety, and hurting my relationships, and all those things that come with it,\u201d she says now, sitting in the corner of a restaurant, in a baseball cap, sipping a green tea. \u201cI felt guilty for not being a visible person for the community, and for having the privilege that I had and not using it. I had got to the point where I was telling myself, you know, you <em>should</em> feel guilty about this. I was an active participant in an element of Hollywood that is gross. I would never judge somebody else for not coming out, but for me, personally, it did start to feel like a moral imperative.\u201d</p> <p>The day after the speech, she flew straight to Montreal to do reshoots for her role as Kitty Pryde in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/22/xmen-days-of-future-past-review-hugh-jackman-peter-bradshaw\">X-Men: Days Of Future Past</a>, and everyone there told her she seemed totally different. \u201cAnd I <em>was</em> totally different! Just the immediacy of how much better I felt. I felt it in every cell of my body.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I'm very proud of the movie [Freeheld], and one of the things I'm most proud about is how it's so not de-gayed</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Videos of her confessional moment soon hit YouTube, and have now been viewed by more than 5 million people around the world. It seems extraordinary that the sexuality of one young person in a secular democracy can still make headline news, but then Hollywood is an extraordinary place. As Page herself says, \u201cIt\u2019ll be amazing, the day when it\u2019s not a thing, when an actress doesn\u2019t feel like she needs to make a speech. That\u2019s obviously the goal.\u201d</p> <p>When we meet, she has just finished shooting a film called <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/freeheld\">Freeheld</a>, which she both co-starred in and helped produce; it has been her passion project to get the story behind it turned into a movie. She and Julianne Moore play real-life couple Stacie Andree and Laurel Hester who, in 2005, fought to have their relationship officially recognised so that Hester, a New Jersey police detective who was dying of cancer, could leave her pension to Andree. Page plays Andree, the upfront young car mechanic who gets angry with her older lover for keeping their relationship a secret.</p> <p>The film got a mixed reception on its US release last year. The New York Times review called it <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/02/movies/review-in-freeheld-a-dying-detective-fights-for-gay-rights.html?_r=0\">\u201cas generic as the bullet points in a gay rights brochure\u201d</a> and declared that \u201cthe lives behind this movie deserve better\u201d, laying some of the blame with screenwriter <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0638913/\">Ron Nyswaner</a>. Nyswaner responded in a speech at a Los Angeles awards ceremony, claiming that the final production was not true to his script, that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/12/freeheld-screenwriter-ron-nyswaner-degaying\">it had been \u201cde-gayed\u201d to make queer lives look more mainstream</a>: \u201cThe gay characters were idealised, their edges were smoothed out, the conflict between them was softened.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5f0b7b917a3f5d81aeefe0d78c2921f5e53178b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f0b7b917a3f5d81aeefe0d78c2921f5e53178b9/0_0_5632_3383/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ellen Page\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I felt guilty for not being a visible person for the community, and for having the privilege that I had and not using it.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amanda Friedman/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Page and I meet the morning after Nyswaner\u2019s speech, and when I bring it up, it is the only time I see her upset. She says Nyswaner has already apologised personally, \u201cbut it was a hard day yesterday\u201d. Her speech falters. \u201cSorry, it clearly affected me. I\u2019m glad he wrote the apology, because\u2026 sorry, it was such a shock to me. I mean, I love the movie, I\u2019m very proud of the movie, and one of the things I\u2019m most proud about is how it\u2019s so <em>not</em> de-gayed. Look, it\u2019s hard to make any independent movie, particularly one that stars two women, and this one also happens to be two, you know, gay women. You will never be able to please everybody, but I cannot even begin to speculate why he would have said that.\u201d</p> <p>Does Page wish more people had seen the film?</p> <p>\u201cOf course! But the thing about movies now is they can have really, really long lives.\u201d She points out that people can find it later online, and that if it didn\u2019t have \u201cthe life in the American theatre that I wish\u201d, that\u2019s not the end of the story.</p> <p>I have to ask her what it was like being married to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/juliannemoore\">Julianne Moore</a>, which, despite the whole terminal cancer thing, must have been pretty great.

After shooting Whip It, directed by Drew Barrymore, Page retreated for a month \u2013 not to a Caribbean beach, but to an eco-village in Oregon with total strangers, where she studied permaculture and went to sleep and woke up with the sun. \u201cWe created giant composts. We\u2019d pee in a bucket with hay in it, then put the pee buckets on the compost.\u201d</p> <p>Did she ever think, I\u2019m a movie star now: I could just press a button and get out of here?</p> <p>\u201cNo! I loved it. When I left and everyone in the class was holding hands in a circle, I was fully sobbing. One of those kinds of cries where you\u2019re just\u2026 I would not have anticipated that\u2019s what my response would have been. I was ugly crying. There was something really special about it, because I\u2019d gone from shooting Juno to Whip It, and then straight there. And all of that was so incredible, but I was clearly desiring something that really felt connected to the earth. And that\u2019s where I met my best friend, Ian Daniel, who\u2019s been my soul twin ever since.\u201d Daniel is a gay man from Indiana, who had driven to Oregon in an old school bus powered by vegetable oil; he describes their friendship as a \u201clove story\u201d, but not a love affair.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I think my gayness was already playing its role in regards to my career</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The soul twins now have a job together, presenting <a href=\"http://www.out.com/popnography/2015/11/06/get-taste-ellen-pages-travel-show-gaycation-viceland\">Gaycation for Viceland</a>. The series was Page\u2019s idea, and it involves them going to parts of the world where coming out doesn\u2019t win you a standing ovation: Jamaica, Japan, or lunch with a US Republican senator. In a Brazilian favela, they visit a man who prides himself on murdering gay people. \u201cHe said things like, \u2018If I\u2019m in my car and I see a gay person, I run them over.\u2019 The moment he walked into the room, it felt like a black hole sucking something out of me. I haven\u2019t experienced anything like it. He didn\u2019t know that we were gay.\u201d Did the thought cross her mind that she could kill him, right then? \u201cYeah, you do stand there thinking, well, what am I doing?\u201d The man left the room before they could say any more. Other encounters have been more aggressive, with people screaming in Page\u2019s face. \u201cAnd then the cameras turn off and they hit on the lesbian: that happens a lot. They\u2019re like, \u2018You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re missing.\u2019 Fuck off!\u201d</p> <p>They made another film with a young man who \u201cfor whatever reason, wanted us to be there when he came out to his mother, which was one of the most intense experiences of my life.\u201d Did his mother not wonder why there was a camera crew in her kitchen? \u201cHe told her that his media friends were here, and she was just sort of like, \u2018Cool.\u2019 It was weird, and believe me, we had a conversation about it: is this OK? It was really what he wanted. But before his mother got there, he asked me, \u2018How did you do it?\u2019 So I shared that with him. But when I\u2019m looking at the edits of the show, if it\u2019s me talking about myself, it makes me cringe a little. The goal is to go and look at the LGBT culture, at the joy and the liberation.\u201d</p> <p>In recent years, Page has spoken publicly about domestic violence, trans rights, gay suicides, inequality. \u201cAnd the thing that I would say you get the most hate about, on social media, in my experience, is if you <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EllenPage\">tweet anything about women\u2019s rights or feminism</a>. It blows my mind. But it\u2019s the thought of <em>not</em> being a feminist that actually blows my mind. I feel that, at least now, there seem to be more women who are willing to say, \u2018Yes, I\u2019m a feminist.\u2019 It\u2019s shocking to me that that would ever be an issue, to <em>not</em> say that. I really struggle to wrap my head around that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"afdd879fb1df9af70874dd97e75130f8e6757b6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/afdd879fb1df9af70874dd97e75130f8e6757b6e/83_139_3073_4615/666.jpg\" alt=\"Ellen Page with girlfriend Samantha Thomas\" width=\"666\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With girlfriend, the artist Samantha Thomas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gregory Pace/BEI/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Otherwise, life is pretty peachy.

          "bodyText": "Within a few minutes of meeting the actor Ellen Page near her Los Angeles home, we\u2019re talking about what she enjoys doing around here, which is going surfing with her girlfriend, artist Samantha Thomas. She likes to watch Thomas, the more experienced surfer, examine the waves. Thomas tells her which way to turn, based on movements in the water that Page can\u2019t even see. \u201cParticularly on days where there are onshore winds, so it\u2019s kind of rough, she\u2019ll say, \u2018Oh, a wave\u2019s coming at you, it\u2019s a right, go right\u2019 and I\u2019m just like, \u2018What are you looking at? You can read the ocean like that?\u2019 It\u2019s really hot,\u201d she adds, the excitement in her gentle voice suggesting that she is quietly, but madly, in love. There is nothing hugely remarkable about any of this, especially here in California, except that until February 2014 Page would have been unable to have such a conversation with a journalist. The actor who starred in Juno, Hard Candy and Whip It, all films about tough young women who go against the grain, was living a lie. She was pretending to be straight, or at least \u201clying by omission\u201d, as she puts it, intent on fulfilling her acting ambitions without any adverse attention, even though she had been out of the closet with her loved ones for years. But the double life had started to take its toll on her sanity, so she decided, a month before the event, that she would come out during a speech at a Las Vegas conference for counsellors of young LGBT people. \u201cI\u2019m here today because I am gay,\u201d she revealed, halfway through an eight-minute talk, to a standing ovation that began before she had even finished. It was Valentine\u2019s Day. Page was only 26, but had been acting professionally since the age of 10; at 20, she was nominated for an Academy Award for best actress for her role as the eponymous pregnant high-school student in Juno. The gulf between her public and private lives had been growing long enough. \u201cI felt, let\u2019s just please be done with this chapter of discomfort and sadness and anxiety, and hurting my relationships, and all those things that come with it,\u201d she says now, sitting in the corner of a restaurant, in a baseball cap, sipping a green tea. \u201cI felt guilty for not being a visible person for the community, and for having the privilege that I had and not using it. I had got to the point where I was telling myself, you know, you should feel guilty about this. I was an active participant in an element of Hollywood that is gross. I would never judge somebody else for not coming out, but for me, personally, it did start to feel like a moral imperative.\u201d The day after the speech, she flew straight to Montreal to do reshoots for her role as Kitty Pryde in X-Men: Days Of Future Past, and everyone there told her she seemed totally different. \u201cAnd I was totally different! Just the immediacy of how much better I felt. I felt it in every cell of my body.\u201d Videos of her confessional moment soon hit YouTube, and have now been viewed by more than 5 million people around the world. It seems extraordinary that the sexuality of one young person in a secular democracy can still make headline news, but then Hollywood is an extraordinary place. As Page herself says, \u201cIt\u2019ll be amazing, the day when it\u2019s not a thing, when an actress doesn\u2019t feel like she needs to make a speech. That\u2019s obviously the goal.\u201d When we meet, she has just finished shooting a film called Freeheld, which she both co-starred in and helped produce; it has been her passion project to get the story behind it turned into a movie. She and Julianne Moore play real-life couple Stacie Andree and Laurel Hester who, in 2005, fought to have their relationship officially recognised so that Hester, a New Jersey police detective who was dying of cancer, could leave her pension to Andree. Page plays Andree, the upfront young car mechanic who gets angry with her older lover for keeping their relationship a secret. The film got a mixed reception on its US release last year. The New York Times review called it \u201cas generic as the bullet points in a gay rights brochure\u201d and declared that \u201cthe lives behind this movie deserve better\u201d, laying some of the blame with screenwriter Ron Nyswaner. Nyswaner responded in a speech at a Los Angeles awards ceremony, claiming that the final production was not true to his script, that it had been \u201cde-gayed\u201d to make queer lives look more mainstream: \u201cThe gay characters were idealised, their edges were smoothed out, the conflict between them was softened.\u201d Page and I meet the morning after Nyswaner\u2019s speech, and when I bring it up, it is the only time I see her upset. She says Nyswaner has already apologised personally, \u201cbut it was a hard day yesterday\u201d. Her speech falters. \u201cSorry, it clearly affected me. I\u2019m glad he wrote the apology, because\u2026 sorry, it was such a shock to me. I mean, I love the movie, I\u2019m very proud of the movie, and one of the things I\u2019m most proud about is how it\u2019s so not de-gayed. Look, it\u2019s hard to make any independent movie, particularly one that stars two women, and this one also happens to be two, you know, gay women. You will never be able to please everybody, but I cannot even begin to speculate why he would have said that.\u201d Does Page wish more people had seen the film? \u201cOf course! But the thing about movies now is they can have really, really long lives.\u201d She points out that people can find it later online, and that if it didn\u2019t have \u201cthe life in the American theatre that I wish\u201d, that\u2019s not the end of the story. I have to ask her what it was like being married to Julianne Moore, which, despite the whole terminal cancer thing, must have been pretty great. Page laughs. \u201cShe\u2019s the best, yeah, and she\u2019s an extraordinary person, too. She\u2019s obviously one of the best actresses, I think, ever.\u201d She was thrilled when Moore signed up, because they had never met; now, they are close friends. \u201cShe\u2019s just a wonderful, utter delight of a human, who just loves her job and works so hard. And has an awesome family.\u201d Ellen Page, real name Ellen Philpotts-Page, grew up in Halifax, in the Canadian maritime province of Nova Scotia. Her father was a graphic designer and her mother a French teacher; Page talks about photos of her as a student in France, before motherhood, \u201cin these beautiful clothes and a really short haircut. She\u2019s stunning.\u201d They divorced when Ellen was tiny, so she spent her childhood between their two houses, a fortnight in each, something she says may have given her an aptitude for \u201cbeing in new spaces all the time\u201d. The young Page lacked her mother\u2019s talent for French, \u201cbut my mom is so passionate about what she does that it made me respect teachers. I was fortunate that I had something ingrained in me, that I had to do well at school.\u201d She became self-sufficient: riding her bike to the woods, jumping in the lake, playing soccer at a high level. She loved Nova Scotia\u2019s remoteness: \u201cYou\u2019re just surrounded by so much beauty and stillness.\u201d But her mother had family in the big city, Toronto, and on one visit they all went to see The Phantom Of The Opera. \u201cI think that was the only show there, ever, and we couldn\u2019t even sit together.\u201d She learned the words to all the songs; she gives me a few lines of The Music Of The Night, giggling. \u201cI asked my mom, \u2018What school do I go to to learn to be Christine?\u2019 and she said, \u2018You go to university.\u2019 And I was like, \u2018You\u2019ll come with me, right?\u2019 She was like, \u2018Honey, by that time, I think you won\u2019t want me to.\u2019 I was like, \u2018No, don\u2019t say that!\u2019\u201d Page left home to work as an actor even sooner than that. She joined the drama club at school, where a casting director spotted her and put her in a television movie, Pit Pony, which became a TV series. \u201cIt\u2019s just mind-boggling, what I do now. I sometimes think, what if I was sick that day the casting guy came into school?\u201d There followed more Canadian TV and films, and another movie shot in Europe. She grew very independent; she was supposed to be accompanied by chaperones on set, but because her parents both worked full-time, \u201cwe\u2019d finagle it so, say, the horse-wrangler\u2019s daughter was my chaperone\u201d. At 16, she moved to Toronto on her own, then went to Los Angeles to star in Hard Candy, an astonishing film about a paedophile and a teenage girl who turns the tables on him. I tell her it blew my mind. \u201cYeah, Hard Candy was intense. My dad came with me to do that. But they were always cool with the subject matter, they trusted me. I think back now to the idea of your daughter moving out at 16, when you\u2019re a child actor,\u201d she pauses. \u201cBut I was so disciplined. I knew this was what I wanted to do.\u201d In the film, her character tortures the older man, handing him a noose in a potential forced suicide. \u201cI remember getting ready for those scenes, I was 16, and I was almost separate from myself: shocked by it, and curious, and excited. It was a very exhilarating feeling, and very addictive.\u201d But it was Juno, in 2007, that sent her career stellar, with nominations for the Oscars, Golden Globes and Baftas. At the Oscars, the film won best original screenplay. Thankfully, Page, who was 20 at the time, had an industry mentor to look out for her; by then she hadn\u2019t built her own life in Los Angeles. \u201cI basically lived with Catherine Keener when I was going through Juno\u2019s awards season time, which was wonderful but crazy. It\u2019s like a lot, you know? We\u2019d met when we worked on a film together that nobody saw.\u201d (An American Crime, a true story in which Keener\u2019s character tortures the younger Page; the film never made it to the cinemas.) \u201cSo she was really protective and kind.\u201d After a trip away, Page landed back in LA on her 21st birthday. \u201cI got to Catherine\u2019s house and she had a surprise party for me.

Peaches, the electro pop star, is now a good friend, too; they met, \u201cweirdly, when I was in Amsterdam with her friend Har Mar Superstar, writing a show we sold to HBO that never got made. I\u2019m crazy about Peaches. I\u2019m going to see her do a show tomorrow.\u201d But it\u2019s not all famous friends and parties. After shooting Whip It, directed by Drew Barrymore, Page retreated for a month \u2013 not to a Caribbean beach, but to an eco-village in Oregon with total strangers, where she studied permaculture and went to sleep and woke up with the sun. \u201cWe created giant composts. We\u2019d pee in a bucket with hay in it, then put the pee buckets on the compost.\u201d Did she ever think, I\u2019m a movie star now: I could just press a button and get out of here? \u201cNo! I loved it. When I left and everyone in the class was holding hands in a circle, I was fully sobbing. One of those kinds of cries where you\u2019re just\u2026 I would not have anticipated that\u2019s what my response would have been. I was ugly crying. There was something really special about it, because I\u2019d gone from shooting Juno to Whip It, and then straight there. And all of that was so incredible, but I was clearly desiring something that really felt connected to the earth. And that\u2019s where I met my best friend, Ian Daniel, who\u2019s been my soul twin ever since.\u201d Daniel is a gay man from Indiana, who had driven to Oregon in an old school bus powered by vegetable oil; he describes their friendship as a \u201clove story\u201d, but not a love affair. The soul twins now have a job together, presenting Gaycation for Viceland. The series was Page\u2019s idea, and it involves them going to parts of the world where coming out doesn\u2019t win you a standing ovation: Jamaica, Japan, or lunch with a US Republican senator. In a Brazilian favela, they visit a man who prides himself on murdering gay people. \u201cHe said things like, \u2018If I\u2019m in my car and I see a gay person, I run them over.\u2019 The moment he walked into the room, it felt like a black hole sucking something out of me. I haven\u2019t experienced anything like it. He didn\u2019t know that we were gay.\u201d Did the thought cross her mind that she could kill him, right then? \u201cYeah, you do stand there thinking, well, what am I doing?\u201d The man left the room before they could say any more. Other encounters have been more aggressive, with people screaming in Page\u2019s face. \u201cAnd then the cameras turn off and they hit on the lesbian: that happens a lot. They\u2019re like, \u2018You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re missing.\u2019 Fuck off!\u201d They made another film with a young man who \u201cfor whatever reason, wanted us to be there when he came out to his mother, which was one of the most intense experiences of my life.\u201d Did his mother not wonder why there was a camera crew in her kitchen? \u201cHe told her that his media friends were here, and she was just sort of like, \u2018Cool.\u2019 It was weird, and believe me, we had a conversation about it: is this OK? It was really what he wanted. But before his mother got there, he asked me, \u2018How did you do it?\u2019 So I shared that with him. But when I\u2019m looking at the edits of the show, if it\u2019s me talking about myself, it makes me cringe a little. The goal is to go and look at the LGBT culture, at the joy and the liberation.\u201d In recent years, Page has spoken publicly about domestic violence, trans rights, gay suicides, inequality. \u201cAnd the thing that I would say you get the most hate about, on social media, in my experience, is if you tweet anything about women\u2019s rights or feminism. It blows my mind. But it\u2019s the thought of not being a feminist that actually blows my mind. I feel that, at least now, there seem to be more women who are willing to say, \u2018Yes, I\u2019m a feminist.\u2019 It\u2019s shocking to me that that would ever be an issue, to not say that. I really struggle to wrap my head around that.\u201d Otherwise, life is pretty peachy. Page recently bought a modernist house in the Hollywood Hills and says that LA really feels like home now. She and her \u201cawesome girlfriend\u201d have a cute dog called Patters, who gets posted a lot on their Instagram feeds. Plus, Justin Trudeau is the new Canadian prime minister. \u201cAnd it\u2019s exciting, not only that he got elected and that Stephen Harper\u2019s finally gone, but because the Liberals have a majority in parliament.\u201d I ask if coming out has affected the roles that are offered to her, and she has to take a breath, nod, sigh. \u201cI\u2019d be lying if I said that wasn\u2019t something I feared, and that\u2019s the big reason so many people haven\u2019t come out. For me, being out within my life became far more important than being in any movie.\u201d Of course, Page wasn\u2019t exactly getting the typical romcom parts anyway. \u201cTotally. I think my gayness was already playing its role in regards to my career. I\u2019m not naive to that element of the business. I hope it changes.\u201d We discuss the gender pay gap in Hollywood, and an essay that Jennifer Lawrence wrote about it. \u201cThe issue is also about how many female writers there are, female directors, even female soundtrack composers,\u201d Page adds. \u201cI just mean, pretty much every facet of this industry. In my circle of friends, it\u2019s something we talk about all the time. And I feel like there\u2019s finally a conversation happening.\u201d \u2022 \u2022 Freeheld goes on general release next month. This article was edited on 10 February 2016, to correct a misspelling of the name of Page\u2019s dog, and to clarify the title of Vice\u2019s new TV channel on which Gaycation is broadcast.",

We\u2019re not in any way shying away from the fact there is risk.

          "bodyText": "Canada is pulling its fighter jets out of the US-led coalition against Islamic State, but will triple its training mission and increase humanitarian aid to the region instead. On Monday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the six CF-18 jets would cease airstrikes on 22 February, following through on a campaign pledge to end Canada\u2019s role in the anti-Isis bombing mission in Iraq and Syria. Trudeau, who was elected to office in November, said boosting security and development efforts will help create capacity to build long-term stability in the region, adding that the new contributions will be more effective and better able to capitalize on Canada\u2019s areas of military and diplomatic expertise. \u201cI\u2019m proud of the mission we\u2019ve put forward,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s complete, it\u2019s robust.\u201d As the fighter jets are pulled out of the region, Canada will increase its military personnel from about 650 to 830, which includes adding roughly 140 new special forces troops to the current 69 serving in an \u201cadvise and assist\u201d role to security forces fighting in northern Iraq. Canada will also begin sending small arms and ammunition to Kurdish peshmerga and Iraqi forces battling Isis. \u201cWe will be supporting and empowering local forces to take their fight directly to Isil, so that kilometre by kilometre, they can reclaim their homes, their land and their future,\u201d said Trudeau, using another acronym for the Islamic State. A Canadian Polaris aerial refueller will remain in the region supporting other coalition members on their bombing sorties in Iraq and Syria, as will a reconnaissance aircraft. The Liberal government will also contribute more than CDN$1.6bn over three years to bolster security, stabilization and humanitarian aid to the region, including increasing counterterrorism efforts in neighbouring Lebanon and Jordan. But officials conceded that the redefined mission will both be more expensive and more dangerous than Canada\u2019s current contribution. Last March, Sergeant Andrew Doiron, 31, a Canadian special forces adviser, was shot and killed by Kurdish special forces in what has been deemed a tragic friendly fire incident. In December, Canadian forces were involved in an Isis initiated attack against Kurdish security forces on the front lines in northern Iraq. Canada\u2019s top soldier, General Jonathan Vance, told reporters Monday that more troops meant more risk. \u201cWe\u2019re putting more people on the ground,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous, it\u2019s a dangerous place to work. We\u2019re not in any way shying away from the fact there is risk. We\u2019ll mitigate it, we\u2019ll manage it.\u201d Canada joined the coalition to strike Isis targets in Iraq in October 2014 under former Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper, following a direct request from the US to participate in the operation. Canada\u2019s participation was expanded to Syria last March. As of 3 February, the CF-18s had conducted 1,344 sorties. In recent months, the US has been working to persuade allies in the 65-member coalition to step up their contributions in the fight against Isis. In January, federal defence minister Harjit Sajjan was not invited to an anti-Isis meeting in Paris with US defence secretary Ashton Carter, which critics maintained was a snub for Canada\u2019s decision to end the bombing mission. On Monday, interim Conservative leader Rona Ambrose said Trudeau \u201cis taking a shameful step backward from our proud traditions by pulling our CF-18s and Canada out of a combat role against the greatest terror threat in the world\u201d. Coalition allies had made it clear they wanted Canada to maintain the bombing mission but Trudeau said he reassured US president Barack Obama that Canada wasn\u2019t backing out of the fight. \u201cHe is thankful that we are stepping up our training and our other areas of involvement and understands the decision that we took,\u201d he said. Pentagon spokesman Peter Cook said Carter welcomed the \u201csignificant contributions\u201d and that he appreciated the decision by the Trudeau government to step up its role in the campaign. \u201cThe Canadian announcement is the kind of response the secretary has been looking for from coalition members as the United States and its coalition partners look to accelerate the campaign against Isil,\u201d Cook said Monday. Following a phone call between the two North American leaders, Barack Obama said he \u201cwelcomed\u201d Canada\u2019s current and new contributions to coalition efforts. Polls indicate the majority of Canadians support the airstrikes. Only 27% supporting the withdrawal of the CF-18s, according to a recent survey by the Angus Reid Institute. Parliamentarians will debate the new mission in the House of Commons next week.",

(The hazardous chemicals allowed on the permit include dioxins, furans, styrene and chlorinated hydrocarbons.) For over three years, the town\u2019s folk have adamantly opposed the permit. Yet the trucks keep hauling in the poison.</p> <p>Minister Polak ignored the caution of nine independent scientists and awarded the toxics permit on the basis of the only proponent, Active Earth. As part of court proceedings brought by local residents challenging the award of the permit, it has been alleged that this engineering firm had an undisclosed 50-50 profit agreement with the dumpsite owner and that its independence has therefore been compromised.</p> <p>Why would a Minister of Environment impose a contamination threat on a town\u2019s water supply?

          "bodyText": "What in the water is going on in North America? In Flint, Michigan, people were unknowingly forced to drink lead-contaminated water for months after Governor Rick Snyder\u2019s administration decided to save money by changing families\u2019 water source from treated Detroit municipal water to the polluted Flint River. The river water contained a variety of biological and other contaminants which, when inappropriately treated with chlorine, apparently caused lead to leach from the ageing city pipes and into the drinking water. More than 100,000 Flint residents have now been subjected to lead poisoning, a very serious developmental hazard for children; documents emerging from the state government indicate that Snyder and senior members of his administration were apprised of the problems with the water and residents\u2019 complaints but dismissed them for months as children were being poisoned. Film-maker Michael Moore has called for Snyder\u2019s arrest and prosecution; others have called for his immediate resignation. But the people of Flint are not alone. A town in Canada\u2019s west coast province of British Columbia is outraged at provincial environment minister Mary Polak, who granted a new facility a 50-year permit to dump up to 100,000 tonnes of toxic soils per year on the watershed of Shawnigan Lake, a drinking water source for a lakeside community of 12,000. (The hazardous chemicals allowed on the permit include dioxins, furans, styrene and chlorinated hydrocarbons.) For over three years, the town\u2019s folk have adamantly opposed the permit. Yet the trucks keep hauling in the poison. Minister Polak ignored the caution of nine independent scientists and awarded the toxics permit on the basis of the only proponent, Active Earth. As part of court proceedings brought by local residents challenging the award of the permit, it has been alleged that this engineering firm had an undisclosed 50-50 profit agreement with the dumpsite owner and that its independence has therefore been compromised. Why would a Minister of Environment impose a contamination threat on a town\u2019s water supply? How can people\u2019s basic right to clean water be ignored? Democracy, it seems, has been failed dismally by those sworn to uphold it. A July 2015 meeting at Shawnigan Lake drew 450 townsfolk; Polak didn\u2019t show up. In fact, she has not once set foot in the community she has endangered. Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) Andrew Weaver called her misconduct a \u201cprofound and persistent dereliction of duty\u201d. There are calls for the minister\u2019s resignation and, if she won\u2019t do her sworn duty to protect watershed gems like Shawnigan Lake, she must step down. Surprisingly, not one member of the BC Liberal government has called the toxic dump permit into question: premier Christy Clark has been silent on this public health issue affecting 12,000 people and so has the minister of health. In the words of Sonia Furstenau, Shawnigan Lake area director: \u201cI weep because each day we lose more faith in the agencies that are supposed to protect us. A company being allowed by our government to dump contaminated soil in our watershed is an affront to democracy. And it is a threat to our survival as a community.\u201d In Flint and in Shawnigan Lake, we have a failure of democracy, of values and of conscience. In the US, part of the problem is that democracy has collapsed into oligarchy. \u201cThe game is rigged,\u201d says Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren. Former president Jimmy Carter agrees. Maybe that is why presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders has gained huge support campaigning for a revolution in US politics. He urges Americans to take back their country from the few billionaires whose undue power and influence has grown to control the mainstream media and even the US Congress. In Canada, at least, the secretive and undemocratic Stephen Harper era is finally over, and the new Justin Trudeau regime has much to undo. Environmental protection suffered under Harper\u2019s gag order on scientists and his slashing of government agency budgets. In sharp contrast, Trudeau\u2019s vow to pursue \u201csunny ways\u201d and run responsible government is a breath of fresh air. British Columbia\u2019s provincial government, however, seems out of touch with the times. People are fed up with corporate lobbyists and tax breaks for the rich; they resent balanced budgets at the expense of teachers and much-needed social programs. What\u2019s needed is a people\u2019s government, one that respects its social and environmental duties. A water scandal at Shawnigan Lake can be a litmus test for BC voters. We have an opportunity to say no to an abusive government, and to say yes to a lakeside town protecting its water supply and way of life. The young children of Flint and Shawnigan Lake are part of the same family. They are humans in their formative years, most vulnerable to the minutest presence of environmental toxins. They deserve priority protection from harms that can have lifelong consequences. Compassion is the hallmark of an enlightened society, and governors and premiers have a duty to put children first. Cabinet ministers and agency directors are sworn to uphold the mandates of their offices.

          "body": "<p>Existential threats to the US homeland have come in many forms \u2013 some real, some imagined. There was immigration from Asia \u2013 referred to in the xenophobic phrase \u201cyellow peril\u201d \u2013 fascism in Europe, communism in the Soviet Union and radical Islam in the Middle East.</p> <p>And now there is Justin Trudeau in Canada.</p> <p>The new Canadian prime minister\u2019s plan to fast-track his country\u2019s intake of Syrian refugees was scrutinised on Wednesday by the US Senate homeland security committee, amid fears that it will enable terrorists to cross the border and reach US soil. Trudeau will make a state visit to Washington next month.</p> <p>The hearing, which did not begin with a rendition of the song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBpgcZ1zYJs\">Blame Canada</a> from South Park, offered a glimpse of the relationship between the US and its northern neighbour, once characterised by Trudeau\u2019s father Pierre, a previous prime minister, as like \u201csleeping with an elephant\u201d.</p> <p>It also raised the possibility that Republican candidate Donald Trump chose the wrong border when he promised to build a wall to keep out people from Mexico. The northern border, it transpires, is far more porous.</p> <p>The committee was told that of 21,000 agents in the US border patrol, only 2,100 are assigned to the northern border, with probably only about 300 of those guarding it at any one time. Witness Dean Mandel of the US National Border Patrol Council said: \u201cI would assess that there are approximately as many Capitol police on duty right now protecting the Capitol complex as we have on the entire 4,000-mile northern border.\u201d</p> <p>On the shorter southern border with Mexico, he added, there is one agent for every linear mile. On the northern border with Canada, there is one agent for every 13.5 miles and much less infrastructure. And the number of Canadian agents on the other side is probably even fewer.</p> <p>Can we expect President Trump to order Trudeau to erect a border wall? There would be practical problems, for a start. Many people cross by boat and the technology that greets them is far from cutting edge. </p> <p>Witness Dr Laura Dawson, director of the Canada Institute at the Wilson Center in Washington, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve got great lakes and great fishing and hundreds of miles of the border is actually under water. I don\u2019t know how you build a wall under water. We\u2019ve got pieces of the border that stretch through mountains.\u201d</p> <p>It may surprise some to know that the primary concern of those worried about the Canadian border is not about hordes of Americans pouring over the border in search of inexpensive healthcare. During his election campaign, Trudeau made the ambitious pledge to resettle 25,000 refugees fleeing the violence in Syria by the end of 2015. This has been delayed slightly to the end of this month. The move was lauded by progressives and liberals as typical of Canadian humanitarianism. Among US Republicans, not so much.</p> <p>Senator Rob Portman of Ohio warned: \u201cIf Canada is accelerating that programme, that puts us more at risk.\u201d</p> <p>Senators questioned whether security would be compromised by overworked Canadian officials failing to vet the refugees properly through background checks. Witness Guidy Mamann, a Canadian legal expert, said they would be under pressure to get the job done for Trudeau: \u201cThis was the crown jewel of his election platform. This is a mark he has to hit.\u201d</p> <p>Witness David Harris, director of the international intelligence programme at Insignis Strategic Research in Ottawa, told the committee that, taking the relative population sizes into account, the 25,000 refugees in Canada would be the equivalent of 225,000 refugees in the US. \u201cBritain, almost twice Canada\u2019s population, will take several years to admit 20,000,\u201d he added.</p> <p>\u201cIf the extensive US intelligence system would have trouble security-screening 10,000 Syrians in a year, how likely is it that Canada, even with valuable US assistance, could adequately screen two and a half times that number in four months?\u201d</p> <p>But Dawson mounted a spirited defence of the Canadian policy. She said refugees coming to the country were from low-risk groups \u2013 families with children, single mothers, and lesbians, gay, bisexual and transgender people \u2013 all of whom have taken refuge in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. Some 60% are women and 22% are children. \u201cThis is not an Isis demographic,\u201d she said.<br></p> <p>While 25,000 is a big number, it is consistent with Canada\u2019s response to historic crises: before it gained independence, it was a haven for African Americans fleeing slavery in the US. \u201cCanadians looked at the images of Alan Kurdi, the little boy on the beach this summer, and said this is not who we are. We are a community of diversity, we are a community who accepts newcomers.\u201d</p> <p>Senator Tom Carper, ranking member on the committee, offered a different, intriguing theory for Canadian kindness: too much space. With a population of just 35 million and a vast land mass, he suggested, it needs more people. </p> <p>Mandel, meanwhile, suggested the refugee resettlement was something of a red herring compared with the 5 million foreign visitors who enter Canada each year. He described its visa waiver system as \u201ca huge security gap\u201d. He also called for more staff, resources and cooperation.</p> <p>Yet through it all, the unfailingly polite American senators \u2013 many from border states including New Hampshire \u2013 went out of their way to flatter their friends in the north, saying how often they had been to Canada, how they had Canadian friends, how they even got mistaken for Canadians. \u201cI love Canadians,\u201d said chairman Ron Johnson, who goes fishing up there.</p> <p>As the hearing drew to a close, Senator Jon Tester of Montana told his colleagues and the Canadian witnesses that the US must accept responsibility for the refugee situation. \u201cWe invaded Iraq 15 years ago looking for weapons of mass destruction. The result of that has been quite frankly the Middle East is a mess. These refugees don\u2019t have any homes, they\u2019ve been destroyed.</p> <p>\u201cThe best way to radicalise people is not to reintegrate them into a society. We have an obligation to figure out how to do this and do this right for the sake of this country, but we cannot ignore it because if we do, we\u2019re not doing anybody any favours on this Earth.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps emboldened by this, it was Dawson who supplied the zinger of the day: \u201cWithout being cute, the United States is more of a risk to Canada than Canada is to the United States.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 9 February 2016. An earlier version said David Harris told the committee that, taking the relative population sizes into account, the 25,000 refugees in Canada would be the equivalent of 255,000 refugees in the US.

          "bodyText": "Existential threats to the US homeland have come in many forms \u2013 some real, some imagined. There was immigration from Asia \u2013 referred to in the xenophobic phrase \u201cyellow peril\u201d \u2013 fascism in Europe, communism in the Soviet Union and radical Islam in the Middle East. And now there is Justin Trudeau in Canada. The new Canadian prime minister\u2019s plan to fast-track his country\u2019s intake of Syrian refugees was scrutinised on Wednesday by the US Senate homeland security committee, amid fears that it will enable terrorists to cross the border and reach US soil. Trudeau will make a state visit to Washington next month. The hearing, which did not begin with a rendition of the song Blame Canada from South Park, offered a glimpse of the relationship between the US and its northern neighbour, once characterised by Trudeau\u2019s father Pierre, a previous prime minister, as like \u201csleeping with an elephant\u201d. It also raised the possibility that Republican candidate Donald Trump chose the wrong border when he promised to build a wall to keep out people from Mexico. The northern border, it transpires, is far more porous. The committee was told that of 21,000 agents in the US border patrol, only 2,100 are assigned to the northern border, with probably only about 300 of those guarding it at any one time. Witness Dean Mandel of the US National Border Patrol Council said: \u201cI would assess that there are approximately as many Capitol police on duty right now protecting the Capitol complex as we have on the entire 4,000-mile northern border.\u201d On the shorter southern border with Mexico, he added, there is one agent for every linear mile. On the northern border with Canada, there is one agent for every 13.5 miles and much less infrastructure. And the number of Canadian agents on the other side is probably even fewer. Can we expect President Trump to order Trudeau to erect a border wall? There would be practical problems, for a start. Many people cross by boat and the technology that greets them is far from cutting edge. Witness Dr Laura Dawson, director of the Canada Institute at the Wilson Center in Washington, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve got great lakes and great fishing and hundreds of miles of the border is actually under water. I don\u2019t know how you build a wall under water. We\u2019ve got pieces of the border that stretch through mountains.\u201d It may surprise some to know that the primary concern of those worried about the Canadian border is not about hordes of Americans pouring over the border in search of inexpensive healthcare. During his election campaign, Trudeau made the ambitious pledge to resettle 25,000 refugees fleeing the violence in Syria by the end of 2015. This has been delayed slightly to the end of this month. The move was lauded by progressives and liberals as typical of Canadian humanitarianism. Among US Republicans, not so much. Senator Rob Portman of Ohio warned: \u201cIf Canada is accelerating that programme, that puts us more at risk.\u201d Senators questioned whether security would be compromised by overworked Canadian officials failing to vet the refugees properly through background checks. Witness Guidy Mamann, a Canadian legal expert, said they would be under pressure to get the job done for Trudeau: \u201cThis was the crown jewel of his election platform. This is a mark he has to hit.\u201d Witness David Harris, director of the international intelligence programme at Insignis Strategic Research in Ottawa, told the committee that, taking the relative population sizes into account, the 25,000 refugees in Canada would be the equivalent of 225,000 refugees in the US. \u201cBritain, almost twice Canada\u2019s population, will take several years to admit 20,000,\u201d he added. \u201cIf the extensive US intelligence system would have trouble security-screening 10,000 Syrians in a year, how likely is it that Canada, even with valuable US assistance, could adequately screen two and a half times that number in four months?\u201d But Dawson mounted a spirited defence of the Canadian policy. She said refugees coming to the country were from low-risk groups \u2013 families with children, single mothers, and lesbians, gay, bisexual and transgender people \u2013 all of whom have taken refuge in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. Some 60% are women and 22% are children. \u201cThis is not an Isis demographic,\u201d she said. While 25,000 is a big number, it is consistent with Canada\u2019s response to historic crises: before it gained independence, it was a haven for African Americans fleeing slavery in the US. \u201cCanadians looked at the images of Alan Kurdi, the little boy on the beach this summer, and said this is not who we are. We are a community of diversity, we are a community who accepts newcomers.\u201d Senator Tom Carper, ranking member on the committee, offered a different, intriguing theory for Canadian kindness: too much space. With a population of just 35 million and a vast land mass, he suggested, it needs more people. Mandel, meanwhile, suggested the refugee resettlement was something of a red herring compared with the 5 million foreign visitors who enter Canada each year. He described its visa waiver system as \u201ca huge security gap\u201d. He also called for more staff, resources and cooperation. Yet through it all, the unfailingly polite American senators \u2013 many from border states including New Hampshire \u2013 went out of their way to flatter their friends in the north, saying how often they had been to Canada, how they had Canadian friends, how they even got mistaken for Canadians. \u201cI love Canadians,\u201d said chairman Ron Johnson, who goes fishing up there. As the hearing drew to a close, Senator Jon Tester of Montana told his colleagues and the Canadian witnesses that the US must accept responsibility for the refugee situation. \u201cWe invaded Iraq 15 years ago looking for weapons of mass destruction. The result of that has been quite frankly the Middle East is a mess. These refugees don\u2019t have any homes, they\u2019ve been destroyed. \u201cThe best way to radicalise people is not to reintegrate them into a society. We have an obligation to figure out how to do this and do this right for the sake of this country, but we cannot ignore it because if we do, we\u2019re not doing anybody any favours on this Earth.\u201d Perhaps emboldened by this, it was Dawson who supplied the zinger of the day: \u201cWithout being cute, the United States is more of a risk to Canada than Canada is to the United States.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 9 February 2016. An earlier version said David Harris told the committee that, taking the relative population sizes into account, the 25,000 refugees in Canada would be the equivalent of 255,000 refugees in the US. In fact he said it would be the equivalent of 225,000 refugees in the US.",

          "body": "<p>When Full Frontal with Samantha Bee debuts on TBS next Monday, much of the focus will be on Bee\u2019s status as the only woman to currently host a late-night show. Even her <a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7Jl7uxrYxUk/Vns8P3_u6pI/AAAAAAACNzk/u_-GwhkwN20/s800/Full%2BFrontal%2BSamantha%2BBee%2Bbillboard.jpg\">own ads have played up the achievement</a>.</p> <p>In fact, the wider world of cable television has welcomed female hosts in recent years, from Chelsea Handler on E! to Nikki Glaser and Sara Schaefer on MTV to Kathy Griffin on Bravo. But while those were pop culture shows targeted at female audiences, Bee\u2019s current events series will probably draw more comparisons to her fellow former Daily Show correspondent John Oliver, whose Last Week Tonight shoots in the same studio as Full Frontal.</p> <p>Daily Show correspondents are most often called on to play a certain combination of blustery and dumbfounded that can make it hard to decipher their unique sense of humor underneath. Oliver\u2019s stint as a Daily Show guest host gave viewers a taste of what to expect when his show premiered; Bee\u2019s job will be trickier. (For her 12 years on the show, her most memorable segment may be her lustily dramatic take on the Fox News talkshow <a href=\"http://www.cc.com/video-clips/930waq/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-passion-and-intrigue-on--the-five-]\">The Five</a>.)</p> <p>\u201cI feel like Sam really does have her own space that nobody has, not just because she\u2019s a woman, but because she\u2019s so good,\u201d said Miles Kahn, a former Daily Show producer who is now an executive producer at Full Frontal. \u201cI\u2019m really looking forward to introducing people to Sam beyond The Daily Show.\u201d </p> <p>From clips shown at a press event on Tuesday, her point of view was clear quickly. An in-studio segment about a Democratic debate had feminist overtones, referring to the \u201cbone-deep sexism of the American people\u201d after a clip of Hillary Clinton, before turning her attention to a Kansas <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/26/us/kansas-women-dress-code-court-apology/\">senator\u2019s recent dress code for women</a> in a bit that let her get a bit blue.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ebfd621ef780fd9f8362aacaa0a0e1b2e9426025\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ebfd621ef780fd9f8362aacaa0a0e1b2e9426025/0_100_4256_2552/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Samantha Bee and the rest of the Daily Show cast\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Samantha Bee and the rest of the Daily Show cast.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brad Barket/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A field piece shot on location in Jordan was as well-produced as any news segment. If the message of the piece was slightly heavy-handed \u2013 Syrian refugees are people too! \u2013 it was both engagingly told and goofy enough to justify its spot on a comedy show. Bee spoke afterwards about her interest in exploring serious stories that affect predominantly women, like the Zika virus, even though they are \u201cnot inherently comedic\u201d. <br> </p> <p>Like Oliver, she has an outsider\u2019s perspective \u2013 the Toronto-born comedian holds dual citizenship, an edge that gives her discussions of US politics and policy a tone that is both globally aware and regionally sympathetic. (She hopes to speak with Justin Trudeau, the new prime minister of Canada, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/12/29/justin-trudeau-invited-to-white-house-state-dinner-raising-hopes-of-bold-faced-canadian-guest-list/\">when he visits the States in March</a>.) She also seems keen to take advantage of her weekly schedule to produce longer, more in-depth segments, something Oliver has done since his weekly HBO show debuted in 2014.</p> <p>One simple element that will differentiate Full Frontal is the stark set \u2013 no desk or couch, just a long panel of TV screens in the main section, and a large LCD screen to one side. \u201cAs a viewer, I am sort of sick of seeing someone sit behind a desk,\u201d Bee explained. \u201cI actually like using my body a little bit more. I find if I\u2019m really stationary, sometimes all the comedy goes into my face and then it\u2019s a really weird performance of me just pulling crazy faces.\u201d</p> <p>A more important distinction will be off-screen; the show\u2019s staffing process \u2013 which included blind submissions and active recruitment of writers outside the world of late-night comedy \u2013 has resulted in a more diverse staff than any in late night. (In fairness, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/dec/10/best-worst-us-culture-2015-comedy-amy-schumer-women-late-night-talkshows\">it\u2019s a pretty low bar</a>.)</p> <p>\u201cHonestly? I could talk for two hours about the process of building our staff,\u201d Bee enthused. \u201cWe have a very diverse workplace in general, and I think that we are reaping the benefits of that in more ways than are even calculable because [\u2026] just the diversity of the pitches alone is worth waking up for every day.\u201d</p> <p>And like all late-night shows, Full Frontal will evolve over time, something Bee and her producers said they were looking forward to. \u201cThe first thing that we wanted to do was create a show that really came from our gut,\u201d she explained after the press conference. \u201cWe wanted to build a show that came from a very deep place in our souls, and with jokes on top of that. So I\u2019m really looking forward to putting a show out on the 8th, coming back into the office on Tuesday, and going, OK, now what? That\u2019ll be where we really start to figure out the show.\u201d</p> <p><em>Full Frontal with Samantha Bee premieres on 8 February at 10.30pm EST.</em></p>",

Daily Show correspondents are most often called on to play a certain combination of blustery and dumbfounded that can make it hard to decipher their unique sense of humor underneath. Oliver\u2019s stint as a Daily Show guest host gave viewers a taste of what to expect when his show premiered; Bee\u2019s job will be trickier. (For her 12 years on the show, her most memorable segment may be her lustily dramatic take on the Fox News talkshow The Five.) \u201cI feel like Sam really does have her own space that nobody has, not just because she\u2019s a woman, but because she\u2019s so good,\u201d said Miles Kahn, a former Daily Show producer who is now an executive producer at Full Frontal. \u201cI\u2019m really looking forward to introducing people to Sam beyond The Daily Show.\u201d From clips shown at a press event on Tuesday, her point of view was clear quickly. An in-studio segment about a Democratic debate had feminist overtones, referring to the \u201cbone-deep sexism of the American people\u201d after a clip of Hillary Clinton, before turning her attention to a Kansas senator\u2019s recent dress code for women in a bit that let her get a bit blue. A field piece shot on location in Jordan was as well-produced as any news segment. If the message of the piece was slightly heavy-handed \u2013 Syrian refugees are people too! \u2013 it was both engagingly told and goofy enough to justify its spot on a comedy show. Bee spoke afterwards about her interest in exploring serious stories that affect predominantly women, like the Zika virus, even though they are \u201cnot inherently comedic\u201d. Like Oliver, she has an outsider\u2019s perspective \u2013 the Toronto-born comedian holds dual citizenship, an edge that gives her discussions of US politics and policy a tone that is both globally aware and regionally sympathetic. (She hopes to speak with Justin Trudeau, the new prime minister of Canada, when he visits the States in March.) She also seems keen to take advantage of her weekly schedule to produce longer, more in-depth segments, something Oliver has done since his weekly HBO show debuted in 2014. One simple element that will differentiate Full Frontal is the stark set \u2013 no desk or couch, just a long panel of TV screens in the main section, and a large LCD screen to one side. \u201cAs a viewer, I am sort of sick of seeing someone sit behind a desk,\u201d Bee explained. \u201cI actually like using my body a little bit more. I find if I\u2019m really stationary, sometimes all the comedy goes into my face and then it\u2019s a really weird performance of me just pulling crazy faces.\u201d A more important distinction will be off-screen; the show\u2019s staffing process \u2013 which included blind submissions and active recruitment of writers outside the world of late-night comedy \u2013 has resulted in a more diverse staff than any in late night. (In fairness, it\u2019s a pretty low bar.) \u201cHonestly? I could talk for two hours about the process of building our staff,\u201d Bee enthused. \u201cWe have a very diverse workplace in general, and I think that we are reaping the benefits of that in more ways than are even calculable because [\u2026] just the diversity of the pitches alone is worth waking up for every day.\u201d And like all late-night shows, Full Frontal will evolve over time, something Bee and her producers said they were looking forward to. \u201cThe first thing that we wanted to do was create a show that really came from our gut,\u201d she explained after the press conference. \u201cWe wanted to build a show that came from a very deep place in our souls, and with jokes on top of that. So I\u2019m really looking forward to putting a show out on the 8th, coming back into the office on Tuesday, and going, OK, now what? That\u2019ll be where we really start to figure out the show.\u201d Full Frontal with Samantha Bee premieres on 8 February at 10.30pm EST.",

          "bodyText": "Canada\u2019s federal government has pledged to overhaul its broken First Nation child welfare program after a human rights body found it was racially discriminating against aboriginal youth by underfunding the system. Tuesday\u2019s ruling by the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal is being called one of the most important rights decisions related to the country\u2019s First Nations in a decade, and it is one that will have a profound and costly impact. The tribunal found the government\u2019s program denied services to First Nations children and families living on reserves, did not adequately address their needs, and through shortfalls made it far more likely for First Nations children to be removed from their families. It also found Ottawa failed to act despite being aware of the adverse affects of the flawed system for years and has ordered the government \u201ccease its discriminatory practices and reform (the program)\u201d. It is weighing compensation for the thousands of children affected by the funding inequity. Cindy Blackstock, who launched the rights challenge with the Assembly of First Nations (AFN) advocacy group nine years ago, called the ruling \u201ca complete victory for children\u201d. \u201cIt strips away any sensibility that First Nations children are being treated fairly by the government of Canada today,\u201d said Blackstock, who serves as executive director of the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society. Federal indigenous affairs minister Carolyn Bennett said she welcomed the ruling and pledged to significantly increase funds available to the program. \u201cWe have to start at making sure that First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis children in this country get the same start in life as all other Canadian children,\u201d she said. The government pegs the actual funding shortfall for on-reserve child welfare services at between 22% to 34%, compared to funding provided by provinces and territories to non-aboriginal children. Blackstock said she estimates the system needs an additional $200m added to the $600m currently earmarked annually for child welfare services. In Canada, 48% of children in foster care are aboriginal even though aboriginal youth make up just 7% of the population. The recent Truth and Reconciliation report \u2013 the result of a six-year investigation into the legacy of Canada\u2019s residential school system for indigenous children \u2013 also flagged the problem and called for reforms to the child welfare system in its 94 recommendations for reconciliation. AFN national chief Perry Bellegarde called Tuesday\u2019s ruling an opportunity to act of that recommendation. \u201cIn this great country, there is no room for discrimination or racism,\u201d he said. \u201cCanada has an obligation to First Nations people to rectify the wrong and remedy the situation.\u201d Justin Trudeau, the liberal prime minister who took office in November, has made repairing the relationship with aboriginal people in Canada one of his government\u2019s top priorities. Aboriginal groups now say they will be looking to the next federal budget \u2013 expected either in late February or in March \u2013 for the funds to back up those commitments. Federal justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould, who was a regional chief with the AFN as the rights complaint was working its way through the courts, said Tuesday the government would be sitting down with Blackstock and other advocates to discuss how to close the gaps in the current system. Asked about the potential costs of reforms, she said: \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to put a price tag on not providing indigenous children with the opportunity to be able to succeed.\u201d",

          "bodyText": "The controversial trade deal between Europe and the US has come under further fire after campaigners accused the government of blocking access to legal advice that shows its impact on the health service. Campaigners warned on Tuesday that the legal documents could reveal the extent to which private health companies can sue the government using a secret tribunal system if a Whitehall policy change were to hit their profits. As part of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), businesses can sue governments or public sector bodies for any loss of profits. The TTIP is an attempt by the US and EU to renegotiate thousands of trade tariffs and reduce the regulatory burden on exporters. The business secretary, Sajid Javid, said in answer to a freedom of information request that disclosing the legal documents would make civil servants cautious when they \u201cneed space in which to seek candid advice from their lawyers\u201d. He said: \u201cThey are less likely to seek such advice if there is an expectation that it will subsequently be disclosable.\u201d But Global Justice Now, which has campaigned for greater transparency in trade negotiations, said the decision would fuel concerns that NHS trusts could come under attack from private contractors using the ISDS (investor state dispute settlement) tribunal system. Nick Dearden, the charity\u2019s director, said: \u201cIf this trade deal is supposed to benefit all of us, why has it been so secretive? The documents we have seen so far have mostly come from Wikileaks or after intense pressure from campaign groups. \u201cAfter this move by the business secretary, the suspicion must be that it is a power grab by large companies keen to sweep away trade barriers and that the NHS is among the most vulnerable,\u201d he said. The EU Commission has denied shutting out stakeholders from the debate, arguing that it conducts regular meetings with interested groups and MEPs in the EU parliament. Critics have accused Brussels of conducting secret negotiations covering food safety law, environmental legislation, banking regulations and a separate tribunal system that allows businesses to bypass the civil courts. Last year, Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, the European commissioner for trade, proposed scrapping ISDS in favour of an international courts system after protests from several European governments. A report by the business, innovation and skills select committee in the last parliament argued that ISDS was unnecessary and business disputes related to TTIP should be conducted through the existing legal systems of each nation. It said the government must be allowed to expand the NHS without facing a legal challenge, and Brussels needed stronger evidence to back up its claim that the deal would bring a boost of \u00a3100bn a year to the UK. It is understood that Barack Obama\u2019s negotiating team has rejected Malmstr\u00f6m\u2019s reform proposal ahead of talks next month. But last week a Canadian newspaper reported that the EU had approached the new administration in Ottawa to revise a trade deal between the EU and Canada (CETA) that will be presented to the EU parliament for ratification in mid 2016, with a view to the deal becoming law in early 2017. Brussels wanted the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, to strip out the ISDS tribunal and replace it with the new international courts system, putting pressure on the US to follow suit.",

          "bodyText": "A Canadian high school student has appeared in court over the murder of two teenage brothers and two teachers in the remote indigenous community of La Loche in Saskatchewan. The 17-year-old, who cannot be identified under Canadian law, was indicted on four counts of first-degree or premeditated murder and seven counts of attempted murder, as well as a weapons charge. He is scheduled to return to court on 22 February. The gun attack on Friday traumatised the 3,000 inhabitants of the small lakeside village of La Loche, in the western prairie province of Saskatchewan. Shock also spread across the nation. Unlike in the neighbouring United States, mass shootings are rare in Canada, where firearms are more regulated. Two brothers \u2013 Drayden and Dayne Fontaine, aged 13 and 17 \u2013 were killed at their home, then two teachers, 21-year-old Marie Janvier and 35-year-old Adam Wood, were shot dead at a school. Seven other people were critically injured, according to police. On Sunday hundreds attended a church service in memory of the victims, while leaders expressed their grief. Town mayor Kevin Janvier and local member of parliament Georgina Jolibois suggested tearing down the school where the shooting took place \u201cbecause of the trauma\u201d. La Loche has long struggled with high rates of addiction, suicide and poverty. In a region that actually has one of the country\u2019s lowest unemployment rates (5.5% versus 7.1% across Canada), in La Loche almost roughly every second adult is unemployed. The suicide rate is three times higher than in the rest of the province. The Canadian government\u2019s House of Commons leader, Dominic LeBlanc, drew attention to the bleak living conditions in La Loche. \u201cThe government has to look at a whole series of measures to improve community safety,\u201d he said. Canada\u2019s recently elected prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has promised to ratify a UN declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples. Canada and three other countries \u2013 Australia, the United States and New Zealand \u2013 were the only nations to vote against the UN indigenous text in 2007. Perry Bellegarde, national chief of the Assembly of First Nations, the main political group representing the country\u2019s aboriginal people, said that in the wake of the La Loche shootings he would put pressure on Trudeau to deliver on election promises to his community. \u201cIt\u2019s a travesty that this quality of life persists in this great, rich country called Canada,\u201d Bellegarde said on Monday. \u201cEveryone\u2019s focused on La Loche now, saying this is not acceptable in 2016.\u201d \u201cWords are easy to say \u2026 there has to be these investments now to get us to the same starting line as everyone else,\u201d Bellegarde said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got 10, 12, 13 people living in a two-bedroom house. That affects everything.\u201d Bellegarde, who voted for the first time in the October election that vaulted Trudeau to power, said he believed the new prime minister \u201cgets it\u201d, referring to the need to improve living standards. Less than half of Canada\u2019s aboriginal people have typically voted in elections because many do not recognise the government\u2019s sovereignty. But anger over disproportionately high rates of violence against indigenous women, dire living conditions as well as resource development and environmental issues prompted Bellegarde to publicly urge aboriginal people to cast ballots last year. In July 2015 the UN Human Rights Committee in a report blamed Ottawa for many of the inequalities affecting indigenous people and urged the government to do more to support natives. As part of an ongoing rapprochement between the federal government and Canada\u2019s more than 600 indigenous tribes, Trudeau has announced an inquiry into why 1,200 indigenous women were murdered or have gone missing over the past three decades \u2013 an investigation long demanded by aboriginal leaders and activists.

          "bodyText": "Let\u2019s end on a heartwarming tale from Davos. One of the most impressive delegates this year was Mark Pollock, the first blind man to race to the South Pole who was later paralysed. Pollock\u2019s wheelchair just broke, leaving him in a serious jam. But he was rescued by a technician who trudged through the snow to find him, and fix it. And he only charged 20 francs. Quite a bargain, and proof that the world isn\u2019t all bad. Delegates are streaming away from the WEF conference all, with a lot to think about. Philip Jennings, head of the UNI Global Union, says this Davos was about \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d. We started the with Oxfam saying that 62 people are as wealthy as the poorest half of the world, prompting warning about inequality and distribution. We ended it with JP Morgan\u2019s Jamie Dimon putting two fingers up to the world, and taking a 30% pay rise. It\u2019s been a funny old Davos this year. The wild swings in the stock markets reminded us that the global economy remains fragile, dominated by emerging market woes and fears of a new global slowdown. But that was trumped by the awful news that at least 45 people drowned yesterday fleeing the Middle East for Europe. The worst January on record for refugee deaths could herald a grim 2016. Davos is nearly over - and delegates are tucking into lunch. It\u2019s quite a menu - including deer, veal ragout, soup, a *huge* swiss cheese , and pancakes (or Cr\u00eape Suzette for posher readers). There\u2019s also a rather large chocolate fountain... We know that George Osborne is a big China fan. And he concluded the session on the Global Economic Outlook by urging global leaders to support Beijing. \u201cThe world has not been very good over previous centuries at accommodating rising powers,\u201d the chancellor warned. \u201cIt is massively in our interests that we bring China into the multilateral institutions of the world.....and make it feel part of the global system.\u201d  China really has dominated this year\u2019s World Economic Forum (along with the refugee crisis). Osborne\u2019s words may fall flat, though, if policymakers fumble the move to a more domestic-driven, consumer based economy. Especially if the credit bubble that has swelled over recent years bursts badly. Bank of Japan governor Kuroda\u2019s suggestion today that China should impose capital controls highlights the pressure on Beijing. Chris Giles of the FT explains: The subject of capital controls is very sensitive for the IMF because late last year it recommended the renminbi be admitted into the fund\u2019s elite basket of currencies, including the US dollar, euro, yen and sterling, on the grounds that it was now \u201cwidely used\u201d and \u201cfreely usable\u201d. Capital controls would undermine both conditions. George Osborne\u2019s comments won\u2019t spare Google from a grilling in parliament over the tax deal. There is plenty of concern that \u00a3130m in back taxes is a rather meagre sum, for a company of Google\u2019s size and importance. And the Public Accounts Committee is determined to dig into it. Meg Hillier MP, chair of the PAC, said overnight that she was \u201cshocked\u201d by the workaround methods used by multinationals. It doesn\u2019t reflect well on the tax officials, either: \u201cHMRC now needs to assure taxpayers that it will keep up the pressure to tackle whatever the next emerging issue is in real time, rather than years later. \u201cIt is effectively admitting it pulled in too little tax from Google for nine out of ten years. \u201cThis is not a great success rate and the Public Accounts Committee will be calling in HMRC and Google to explain. George Osborne has told the Guardian that the \u00a3130m tax deal announced with Google overnight is a \u201chuge step forward\u201d Speaking to my colleagues Larry and Jill just after his panel debate in Davos, the chancellor said he regarded it as a major success for the government. He told us: This is a major success of our tax policy. We\u2019ve got Google to pay taxes and I think that is a huge step forward and addresses that perfectly legitimate public anger that large corporations have not been paying tax. I think it\u2019s a really positive step. I hope to see more firms follow suit and of course I\u2019ve introduced a diverted profits tax which will require this going forward. So I think it\u2019s a big step forward and a victory for the government\u201d. Overnight, the search giant announced that it will pay \u00a3130m to the UK - a decade\u2019s worth of tax. It will also pay more taxes in the UK in future, as part of a shake-up of the way the multinational pays tax. Osborne\u2019s comments at Davos come after Labour shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, criticised the deal. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson reports: People will be \u201csceptical\u201d about what he said looked like a \u201csweetheart deal\u201d, he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Saturday, adding that HMRC seemed to have settled for a \u201crelatively trivial amount of money.\u201d McDonnell will be asking HMRC to publish full details of what it believed Google owed. He said he would raise the issue in Parliament next week as the issue needed \u201cwider scrutiny\u201d. The session ended with Christine Lagarde calling for a new way of measuring economic success: I\u2019ll do a more thorough wrap-up in a minute. Tidjane Thiam, head of Credit Suisse, reckons we are not on the brink of another banking crisis despite the recent market turmoil. Q: Does Christine Lagarde think China needs capital controls? Lagarde replies that it wouldn\u2019t be a particularly good idea for Beijing to burn through all its reserves propping up the yuan. China needs to give clarity, certainty and one message on exactly how the exchange mechanism works, and what the yuan is being measured against. Onto China, which has been eating into its foreign exchange reserves in an attempt to support the yuan. Kuroda says that Beijing faces a tough battle, and may need consider new restrictions to prevent money leaving the country. He says: China\u2019s authorities have been struggling to avoid excessive depreciation or appreciation of its currency while also maintaining an accommodative monetary stance. My personal view, which may not be shared by the Chinese authorities is that in this somewhat contradictory situation, capital controls could be useful to manage the exchange rate as well as domestic monetary policy in a consistent and appropriate way. Japanese central bank governor Kuroda says that inflation, currently around zero, could strengthen significantly if the oil price recovers. And if not, he\u2019s prepared to do more. Echoing the famous pledge from ECB chief Mario Draghi, Kuroda says: The Bank of Japan is fully committed to achieving the price stability target of 2% and will do whatever it takes to achieve that target, at the earliest stage. We don\u2019t believe there are any limits to our policy tools, he adds. Japan\u2019s central bank chief, Haruhiko Kuroda, says he doesn\u2019t believe China\u2019s economy will crash. Markets have been volatile this year, against heightened uncertainty over China\u2019s economy and oil prices, he says. But he does not share the pessimistic view about the implications. China\u2019s slowdown is due to the challenge of rebalancing its economy. Q: Will Britain be in the EU in a year? Osborne says he is optimistic of getting a good deal for Britain and the European Union. And he insists that Europe needs to reform itself. I don\u2019t want my continent priced out of the world economy. And if the British people see we are delivering that change across Europe, they will vote to stay in a reformed EU. Osborne says that Europe likes to cut a deal at the 11th hour, because the Greek banks need to open or a bond needs paying. But we aren\u2019t behaving like the greek government. We have taken a much more measured approach, approaching Europe as friends, colleagues and allies. Osborne says that in \u201ca mature and measured way\u201d we can get that agreement, maybe at the February meeting. If it\u2019s not a good deal, Britain won\u2019t sign. But given all the challenges in the EU, I think it\u2019s in Europe\u2019s interests to give us a deal that works for all member states. W Q: Is there any chance of a deal in the next few weeks that will satisfy the huge eurosceptical forces in the UK? There will be people who want to leave Europe, come what may, and some who want to stay, George Osborne replies. But if David Cameron can come back with a creditble reform packate, we can make a case for staying. There is goodwill out there, we now have to make it happen. Britain has three priorities through our EU renegotiation, says Osborne: We want to create a more competitive European union, to create more jobs and growth Want to address concerns about migration. Mainstream governments should not ignore these pressure, but should address the legitimate concerns that can fuel them. Thirdly, we need a better working relationship between euro and non-euro countries, and the fact that large countries such as the UK will not be in the eurozone. There is a remorseless logic that the eurozone needs ever-closer union, and Britain does not want to be part of it, Osborne concludes. Now George Osborne speaks, saying his \u2018clear economic plan\u2019 has given the UK a pretty secure footing going forwards. But we don\u2019t duck big decisions - the Scottish referendum, for example, has \u201cchecked a move towards the break-up\u201d of the UK. And with the EU referendum, Britain is seeking a more competitive EU. I have sat on panels for five years, hearing people talk about creating more competition. Now we need to do it, says Osborne. And he cites an old Chinese proverb: Talk does not cook rice. On Europe, Lagarde says the economy is in better shape than a year ago,. But the IMF has two big concerns: One is Brexit, and whether there is a deal between the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe. We hope very much [there is a deal], as it would really be conducive to more stability and a more cohesive economic zone. The second is the refugee crisis, which Lagarde calls a \u2018make-or-break\u2019 issue for Europe, Lagarde adds. If it is well-handled and the integration process is handled well, it will be an upside for the eurozone, boosting growth particularly in Sweden and Germany. So do you agree that the refugee crisis is \u2018make or break\u2019 for the Schengen area? Speaking personally, not as MD as the IMF, Yes, I think so, Lagarde replies. Lagarde says there are four key risks: China\u2019s economic rebalancing, as it moves from industry to service, export to domestic market,and investment to consumption. Commodity prices, where the fall has accelerated in the last 18 months. Asynchronous monetary policies around the world, creating capital flows as money returns to the US, depreciating the currencies of some emerging markets. And emerging markets - Lagarde says India and China are performing much better than Brazil or Russia. [Is this the death of the BRICS idea?] Christine Lagarde says the IMF believes the world economy will grow at a faster rate, even though it cut its growth forecasts this week. From 3.1% in 2015, the IMF expects growth of 3.4% in 2016 and 3.6% in 2017. Credit Suisse CEO Tidjane Thiam says the financial markets have had their worst start to a year ever. Fears over China\u2019s economy are a prime factor, prompting market turmoil and concerns that we could be heading into a global recession. Massive outflows from asset managers, some from sovereign wealth funds, as they face losses on their And there is a shortage of liquidity in the market, which means shares and bonds are more volatile. But investors are over-reacting, and should remember that the fall in the oil price is good for consumers, good for Europe, and good for 5 billion people who are net importers of oil. The FT\u2019s Martin Wolf is chairing the debate, and spending several minutes running through the state of play today. And it\u2019s not great - world stock markets are in turmoil, everyone\u2019s worrying about China, emerging economies face a tough year, the US economy may be slowing too, the migration crisis is threatening European Union, populism is on the rise, and Britain may be heading towards Brexit. What on earth is going on, he demands? Reminder, the panel are UK chancellor George Osborne, Japanese central bank governor Haruhiko Kuroda, IMF managing director Christine Lagarde, Indian finance minister Arun Jaitley, and Credit Suisse CEO Tidjane Thiam. Cowbells are ringing across the Davos conference centre (yes, really), signalling that the debate on the Global Economy is starting now. This year, the Guardian\u2019s Davos bureau is a prime table at the heart of WEF, just outside the office of founder Klaus Schwab. And from there, we\u2019ve seen a string of senior politicians and top central bankers emerge from a meeting. That includes the IMF\u2019s Christine Lagarde, Bank of England governor Mark Carney, Finland\u2019s finance minister Alex Stubb, and Axel Weber of UBS. It\u2019s not a crisis meeting, though, but an IGWEL - an informal gathering of world and economic leaders. Stubb has helpfully tweeted from the meeting. Gideon Rachman, the Financial Times\u2019s top foreign affairs writer, reckons that this year\u2019s World Economic Forum has been dogged by the \u201cshadow of populism\u201d: Davos delegates shouldn\u2019t be surprised that the public are looking at the state of the world economy, and the political landscape, and decide that a change is needed. But the sort of populism promoted by Donald Trump is rather alien, and alarming, for those at WEF. Gideon writes: The shadow of Donald Trump has loomed over Davos this year. So has the prospect that refugee flows into Europe will undermine centrist leaders such as Angela Merkel, the German chancellor. More broadly, those at Davos are aware that they increasingly represent the \u201cunpopular\u201d \u2014 the business and political elites that are the targets of public anger and disillusionment. Sooner or later, most corridor conversations in Davos have turned to the US presidential election. It is gradually dawning on people in the Swiss resort that either Mr Trump or Ted Cruz, the Texas senator, will probably win the Republican nomination, and that the \u201cunthinkable\u201d \u2014 a Trump or Cruz victory in November\u2019s presidential election \u2014 could happen. Our economics editor Larry Elliott has been coming to Davos for two decades. And he writes that this year\u2019s meeting has been particulary dominated downbeat. For Justin Welby, mulling over the state of the world in Davos has been easier than the previous week spent trying to hammer out an Anglican church compromise over gay marriage. The Archbishop of Canterbury even cracked one of the better jokes at the World Economic Forum. Asked whether god is in cyberspace, Welby replied: \u201cI think he must be because every time I am on the underground or a bus I see people looking at their computer or mobile phone saying \u2018oh god, why won\u2019t this work\u2019.\u201d Humour has been in short supply at this year\u2019s Davos. The optimism of a year ago that the global economy was on the up after the deep slump of 2008-09 has disappeared fast.... Here\u2019s the full piece: So, what have we learned from Davos this year? In a nutshell, the so-called \u2018global elite\u2019 are worried about a range of problems, and struggling to make much progress in solving them. There\u2019s been no end of talk about refugees, market turmoil, oil, the risk of a new pandemic, and gender inequality. But no real sign that we\u2019re close to a breakthrough on any of it. As one senior delegate put it, 2016 is going to be a year of shocks. Some delegates might be heading for the ski slopes but there still signs of work being done. It\u2019s all go in the main Congress centre this morning. We\u2019ve spotted Bank of England governor Mark Carney, Canada\u2019s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Tidjane Thiam, chief executive of Credit Suisse and WPP\u2019s Sir Martin Sorrell coming from one direction. From another direction there\u2019s been a string of top bankers. To name a few: Ana Bot\u00edn of Santander, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio of Lloyds Banking Group, Bill Winters of Standard Chartered, Axel Webber of UBS and Stuart Gulliver of HSBC. A drugs scandal has hit Davos this year, in a serious embarrassment for the Swiss authorities. It\u2019s not the delegates who have been puffing and snorting, though, but a dozen of the soldiers who patrol the ski resorts roads. They\u2019ve been sent home, and may face criminal charges. The AFP newswire has the details: Twelve on-duty soldiers had tested positive on Tuesday for cannabis and five of them had also used cocaine, army spokesman Stefan Hofer told the ATS news agency. The twelve, among some 4,500 soldiers brought in to ensure security at the World Economic Forum this week, had been tested after others in their unit raised the alarm. Using drug-sniffing dogs, military police had also discovered that one of the soldiers had more than three grammes of cocaine in his possession, according to the report. Guten Morgen. Just like the wicked, there\u2019s no rest for the world\u2019s global elite. So world leaders, CEOs, union chiefs, economists and journalists are gathering for the final act of the 2016 World Economic Forum. There\u2019s a different feel in Davos today. Partly because it\u2019s Saturday, which means this gorgeous ski resort actually has some skiers here today, trudging through the snow alongside delegates. And partly because after three days discussing the problems of the world economy, everyone\u2019s a bit shattered and ready to go home. But not before the final big event, a debate on the world economy. On the panel: UK chancellor George Osborne, Japanese central banker Haruhiko Kuroda, IMF managing director Christine Lagarde, Indian finance minister Arun Jaitley, and Credit Suisse CEO Tidjane Thiam. It begins in an hour\u2019s time, at 10.30am Davos time or 9.30am UK time. You should be able to watch it here. We\u2019ll cover it in this liveblog, along with any other major developments at Davos, and try to work out what (if anything) has been achieved this year....",

Ahead of his speech to Davos the ECB president has lifted markets with <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/21/ecb-interest-rate-hold-steadies-markets\">his hints of further stimulus at the bank\u2019s March meeting.</a></strong> Also helping was talk from Saudi Arabia of a recovery in oil prices later this year, which has pushed Brent Crude more than 5% higher to $30.81 a barrel.</p> <p>So on Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped... while in Asia the Nikkei soared nearly 6% and the Hang Seng 3%. A tumultuous week looks set for a positive end.</p> <p>That even applies to the Shanghai Composite, which is up 1.3% on the day and 0.5% on the week - a surprising outcome given the chaos in the markets over the past few days. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A sharp rebound in crude oil as well as some warm words from ECB President Mario Draghi turned out to be the perfect ingredients to prompt a sharp snapback in equity markets yesterday after Wednesday\u2019s rout, and this rebound has spilled over into the Asia session with crude oil recovering above the $30 level. The big question now is whether this marks a medium term base, or just a minor relief rally before another leg lower. Given yesterday\u2019s rebound and the subsequent positive session in Asia there now remains the very real possibility that we could well finish the week in positive territory, and if that happens it would be a remarkable turnaround after Wednesday\u2019s carnage.</p> </blockquote> <p>The opening calls for Europe from IG show an upbeat start:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/IGSquawk/statuses/690421720482762752\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Our European opening calls:&#10;&#10;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FTSE&amp;src=ctag\">$FTSE</a> 5821 up 47&#10;$DAX\u00a09671 up 97&#10;$CAC\u00a04246 up 39&#10;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24IBEX&amp;src=ctag\">$IBEX</a> 8515 up 71&#10;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MIB&amp;src=ctag\">$MIB</a> 18887 up 164</p>&mdash; IGSquawk (@IGSquawk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IGSquawk/status/690421720482762752\">January 22, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-01-22T07:45:46.390Z\">at 7.45am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-56a1d156e4b0de2cb0bfba25\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/graemewearden\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-01-22T07:23:28.684Z\">7.23am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Davos 2016: Draghi, Kerry, Macri to speak</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Good morning from Davos, where the third day of the World Economic Forum is getting underway.</strong></p> <p>There\u2019s a big focus on geopolitics today, with US secretary of state John Kerry giving a big keynote address.</p> <p>The migration crisis is also in focus, as Europe braces for another inflow of refugees from the turmoil in the Middle East.</p> <p>Overnight, France\u2019s prime minister, Manuel Valls, has warned that the crisis is destabilising Europe.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/22/french-pm-manuel-valls-says-refugee-crisis-is-destabilising-europe\">French PM Manuel Valls says refugee crisis is 'destabilising' Europe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But there\u2019s no escape from economic worries - European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi is due to address Davos shortly.</p> <p>Investors around the world will be watching closely; yesterday, Draghi hinted that the ECB could take fresh action in March.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Brenda_Kelly/statuses/690433101676335104\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">SuperMario due to speak at the World Economic Forum, in Davos at 7.45am</p>&mdash; Brenda Kelly (@Brenda_Kelly) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Brenda_Kelly/status/690433101676335104\">January 22, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, UK prime minister David Cameron and chancellor George Osborne will be going round Davos, trying to stir British businesses into supporting them in the EU referendum.</p> <p>And Argentina\u2019s president, Mauricio Macri, is in town.

          "bodyText": "This liveblog is creaking under the weight of another day of Davos, so here\u2019s a round-up of the main events. On Migration.... ECB chief Mario Draghi has said the refugee crisis can be good for the European economy, as long as there is determination and confidence. Secretary of State John Kerry has called for a 30% boost in aid spending, and insisted that countries can resettle refugees without endangering national security. David Miliband of International Rescue has said it\u2019s vital to distinguish between refugees and economic migrants, to stop the whole system collapsing On UK matters... Chancellor George Osborne has said Britain will not panic over the turbulence in the markets. Osborne also predicted that the Brexit debate will \u201cget interesting\u201d once voters learn the different options on the table. On gender equality Canadian PM Justin Trudeau has urged delegates not to be afraid to call themselves feminists. While Facebook\u2019s Sheryl Sandberg has warned that gender bias starts in the home, when children get their first pocket money for helping out. On the global economy.... Harvard professor Ken Rogoff said 2016 will be a rough year for emerging markets The head of the WTO has told us he\u2019s optimistic about making progress on trade liberalisation. Christine Lagarde has thrown her hat into the ring to remain as IMF chief for a second term. And in the markets.... Stocks have surged back, on hopes that policymakers will deliver more stimulus if needed to keep the world economy on track. And that may well be all for tonight..... If so, we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Guet Nacht! GW Global stock markets have bounced back at the end of a tumultuous week, as oil prices recovered and the European Central Bank president, Mario Draghi, raised hopes of morefurther stimulus measures. It was a week that saw panic selling in global markets, pushing several of them, including London and Japan, into bear market territory, as oil prices tumbled to fresh 13-year lows below $28 a barrel. On Friday, however, European markets rebounded, following a heavy hint from Draghi that the ECB was ready to inject fresh stimulus into the eurozone at the March meeting \u2013 sooner than many investors expected. Here is how things look at Friday\u2019s close: The FTSE 100 index in London has rallied 2.2%, or 126 points, to 5900.01. It is still down 5.5% since the start of 2016. Germany\u2019s Dax is up 2.3%, France\u2019s CAC added 3.3% and Spain\u2019s Ibex added 3.5%. Brent crude is up 7.6%, or $2.24, at $31.48 per barrel. It started the year at $37.85. On Wall Street, stock markets have followed their European counterparts higher. The Dow Jones industrial average is up 0.8% at 16,005 and the S&amp;P 500 is up 1.4% at 1,895. Draghi\u2019s hints had kicked off a \u201cfull-on relief rally\u201d said Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets. He adds: \u201cGlobal stocks rebounded strongly on Friday, capping a massive two-day about turn that erased sharp declines early in the week. The rally was aided by a surging oil price and talk of stimulus from both the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan. The FTSE 100 has seen its first weekly gain this year. The gain is all the more impressive after Britain\u2019s main stock index fell into bear market territory with a 20% decline to the lowest levels since 2012 on Wednesday.\u201d Canadian PM Justin Trudeau is living up to his reputation as a 21st century leader (complete with a gender-balanced cabinet). Trudeau tells Davos that: \u201cLet\u2019s start rewarding politicians and companies who aren\u2019t driven by a macho approach.\u201d He also says feminism isn\u2019t anything to be afraid of: Melinda Gates has told the panel session that she always made sure there were science projects for her husband Bill to do with the children on Saturdays. Their two daughters have ended up interested in maths and science. Chinese businesswomen Zhang Xin, who set up property company SOHO with her husband, says she in favour of quotas to address gender balance. She tells Davos: \u201cI think quotas are an effective way of breaking old habits and bias.\u201d Sheryl Sandberg is less convinced, pointing out that Norway introduced 40% quotes for boardrooms but only 3.4% of companies are run by women. \u201cIt\u2019s not trickling down,\u201d she said. There\u2019s a toddler wage gap in the US, and different expectations between boys and girls, Sheryl Sandberg declares. Gender inequality starts that early, she believes, because: Little boys in home do fewer chores at home and get paid more. We assign our chores to our children in the United States so that the boys are taking out the trash, it takes less time than cleaning the dishes and they get higher allowances. So we start out with different expectations in our home, and the time spent on these different tasks is incredibly important, she adds. Melinda Gates says companies need to have proper family leave policies, not just maternity leave policies. Paternity leave is a way of distributing the burden, as men who take it will spend more time at home helping with the children and the household tasks. America is particularly poor, she adds - just two states have proper family leave policies. Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook started the session on gender parity with the same polling method that she started a session earlier in the week, asking women if they had been asked whether they should be working and if had been described as being too aggressive at work. She said that women were expected to nurturing roles in the office. The irony of the boss of recruitment agency Manpower being on the panel has not be lost on the BBC reporter Lyse Doucet who has tried to convince Jonas Prising to change the name. He appears to have rejected the idea - a brand in 80 countries for 70 years, he says. Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s COO, says that the big problem with gender parity is the expectations of what is appropriate for woman. Culturally we are so different around the world, but there\u2019s a really deep cultural similarity, says Sandberg, namely: Men are expected to lead, to provide, to be decision makers. And women are expected to nurture. So women end up doing the \u2018housework\u2019 in the office, and almost all of the housework at home. And we also have an expectations that women won\u2019t lead, says Sandberg. She asks the men in the audience to put their hands up if they\u2019ve ever been told they\u2019ve been too aggressive at work. A couple of hands rise. Now for the women, put your hands up if you\u2019ve ever been told you were too aggressive at work.... and a lot of hands go up: Sandberg then asks \u201cMen, have you been asked whether you should be working?\u201d I can\u2019t see many hands at all. Now the women.... Again, plenty of hands go up. That\u2019s the issue, Sandberg concludes. A debate on gender equality is kicking off in the Congress Hall now, including Melinda Gates, Facebook\u2019s Sheryl Sandberg, and Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau. You can watch it here. Jonas Prising of Manpower Group is also on the panel - the moderator jokes that he\u2019s only allowed if he promises to change the name to Humanpower Group. Melinda Gates speaks first, saying she\u2019s encouraged that women and girls are at the heart of the new sustainable development goals. We\u2019ve all come to recognise that, if you want this increase in equity, if you want this increase in GDP, you\u2019ve got to get the other half working. And politicians are learning that you need to ensure your women and girls have health, and have education. More from the UK chancellor: US manufacturing has performed more strongly than expected at the start of 2016. The Markit manufacturing PMI for January rose from 51.2 in December to 52.7 in January, better than the dip to 51.1 which had been expected. The global rally prompted by hopes of further stimulus from the European Central Bank, as well as a surge in the oil price, is continuing in the US. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has started the last day of a tumultuous week with a rise of 180 points or 1.1%. Like other markets it is now in positive territory since Monday. The S&amp;P 500 is up 1% and Nasdaq has opened 1.8% higher. Meanwhile Brent crude is now up 8% at $31.6 a barrel, helped by comments from Saudi Arabia that $30 oil is irrational and a rebound is likely, as well as the current cold spell boosting demand. In Europe the FTSE 100 is up 2%, Germany\u2019s Dax is 2.2% better and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 3.4%. Christine Lagarde has just spoken to the press, confirming that she will run for a second term as managing director of the International Monetary Fund. In a brief statement, the IMF MD says she has pushed through \u201cquite a few initiatives\u201d and \u201cmoved the institution on, together with a fantastic team of staff\u201d. And I\u2019m prepared to serve the membership longer. So I\u2019m full of energy and enthusiasm to do so. Lagarde first told French TV this morning that she would run again, having been nominated by several finance ministers including the UK\u2019s George Osborne. George Osborne says that the referendum debate in Britain will get \u201cinteresting\u201d when voters learn what the alternatives are. Answering a question after his speech in Davos on what contingency plans the Government has for Brexit, the chancellor said the civil service, the foreign office and the Treasury were currently \u201c100% focused\u201d on the negotiations.\u201d When it comes to the debate the Government will be required publish alternatives to membership of the EU and what arrangements we will have with our neighbours\u201d, Osborne says. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be one of the most interesting aspects of the referendum debate\u201d. Osborne did not spell out the choices, but they include the Norwegian, Swiss and WTO options. The Norwegian and Swiss options provide access to the European single market on payment of a fee but without any say in how the rules are made. The WTO option means Britain would get the same access to the EU market as any other country that was party to global free trade deals. The chancellor played a straight bat when asked about Brexit, saying it was important the talks succeeded and that Britain had the right sort of relationship. He placed special emphasis on how the UK would co-exist with a eurozone that was going to become more integrated due to necessity. But he seemed to be suggesting that the staying in camp would get a boost when the alternatives are laid out. The Telegraph\u2019s James Quinn helpfully tweeted some key points from the lunch too: Elsewhere in Davos, the new Canadian prime minister has been chatting to the boss of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba. We hear that it might have been a lunch of economic policy leaders - with the Archbishop of Canterbury thrown in for good measure. Anyway, Christine Lagarde and entourage just breezed past at speed, and Bono came the other way, warbling happily (I don\u2019t think *he* was in this lunch). So normal service is restored. Mark Carney has now emerged from this lunchtime meeting, and we believe that George Osborne may have nipped into. We don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything particularly unusual about this gathering - probably just a chance for all the key players to catch up. It appears that some of the heavy hitters in Davos have held a lunchtime meeting. A few have just left, including Kofi Annan, Ukranian president Poroshenko, Former US vice-president Al Gore, OECD chief Angel Gurria, and the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby. Japan\u2019s central bank chief, Haruhiko Kurodo, also emerged. A big crowd has gathered, to see who is next. After a weary time at Davos, UK reporters are resting their legs, tucking into a good lunch, and listening to George Osborne talk to business leaders (the things we go through for you.....) It\u2019s a typically business-friendly speech from the chancellor; he\u2019s telling CEOs that his door is always open to them. He\u2019s also sounding relaxed about the turmoil in the markets, saying that Britain won\u2019t panic because China has hit a few bumps in the road. The two countries are partners for the long term. There\u2019s a few curious quotes too: Former UK prime minister Tony Blair is also in Davos (you\u2019ll be unsurprised to hear), and has spoken about the UK\u2019s upcoming EU referendum. Blair doesn\u2019t think Brexit would be sensible - again, not a shock given the man once rather fancied being president of Europe. The big issue is how we compete with emerging markets like India and China, rather than quitting the largest commercial market and biggest political union in the world. In the end, Blair thinks, and hopes, David Cameron will get a \u201cperfectly good deal from Europe\u201d. But he also predicts that there will be \u201cmore and more uncertainty\u201d as the vote nears. A quick look at the markets, which are continuing their rebound. The FTSE 100 is now up 135 points or 2.3%, Germany\u2019s Dax has added 197 points or 2% and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 132 points or 3%. All three indices are in positive territory for what has been a tumultuous week. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is expected to open around 190 points higher. Oil is also rising again, buoyed by comments from Saudi Arabia that prices could rebound later this year and also by the recent cold snap which is expected to have lifted demand. Brent crude is now up nearly 6% at $30.95 a barrel. Secretary of state John Kerry turns to the refugee crisis, saying President Obama will host a summit at the UN this autumn to rally the world community. The aim is to: Increase by 30% the response to humanitarian funding appeals, Increase the number of humanitarian donors. To a least double the number of refugees resettled or given other safe channels. Expand by 10 the number of countries taking refugees Get a million children into school and a million people working legally. The private sector, civil society, religious groups will be called on to integrate refugees and give them access to employment. And Kerry insists that this isn\u2019t a security threat, saying: I know we can do it in a way that protects the security of our countries. That sounds like a rebuttal to Donald Trump\u2019s promise to impose a ban on Muslims from entering the US, if he become president, which caused such outrage. Last year, people were claiming that Ebola would claim a million lives by last Christmas, Kerry continues. But with international co-operation, including US soldiers sent in by President Obama, the outbreak was stemmed (it killed around 11,000 people). The US and Cuba still have differences, but we are much closer and able to discuss how to close then and \u201cmarch down his road\u201d, says Kerry. John Kerry\u2019s relentlessly upbeat message to Davos is not to give up, there is a lot of positivity in the world too. Between 1990 and 2015 - child mortality has halved. Life expectancy has increased dramatically. The number in extreme poverty has more than halved. And progress is being made on getting more girls into education. The nuclear deal with Iran is also vital, Kerry says, bringing the world back from the brink of war. We were on the cusp of confrontation. I can\u2019t tell you how many leaders, as I travelled through certain areas, told me \u2018you\u2019ve got to bomb it\u2019. Every one of Iran\u2019s pathway to a bomb is now blocked, due to the 98% cut in its uranium stocks and reductions in its ability to refine then. US secretary of state John Kerry is giving his keynote address to Davos. He reminds delegates of the terrible scenes of 2015, from the tiny boy found drowned on a Turkish beach to the Jordanian pilot burned alive by ISIS. I can\u2019t think of a time in my life when I have seen so much atrocity live, thrown at us so relentlessly. Some people wonder if we are trapped in an irreversible decline, a new normal. And if that were true, no politician could fight it. I do not believe that is where we find ourselves. We are not the victims of a pre-destined future, Kerry continues. We feel frustration, because we want to change it. People don\u2019t fly to Davos to celebrate the status quo. You\u2019ve come here to change the world for the better, and define the future. Away from Davos for a moment. Bundesbank president Jens Weidmann, a notable hawk on the European Central Bank\u2019s governing council, is thought to be one of the committee members who helped temper the bank\u2019s stimulus programme in December. The meeting disappointed markets by taking less action than analysts had expected. On Thursday ECB president Mario Draghi hinted at further measures at the bank\u2019s meeting in March, and played down suggestions of splits on the council. And there may be a sign that his dovish words could be followed through: The only time Syrian refugees smile, if you meet them in Jordon or Lebanon or Greece, is when you ask them if they\u2019ll ever go home, David Miliband continues. They say \u2018Inshallah\u2019, God Willing. I want to go home. And they\u2019re not fleeing for economic reasons, they\u2019re fleeing out of utter desperation that if Assad\u2019s barrel bombs don\u2019t get them, and ISIS don\u2019t get them, the Russians will get them. If we fail to see this as problem of monumental political failure inside Syria, we\u2019ll never get to the source of it. Miliband also hits back at suggestions that Europe could tighten its borders to stem the flow from the Middle East. \u201cLet\u2019s get real about this\u201d, the International Rescue chief says (channelling his old boss, Tony Blair?) If any of us were in Syria, or in Lebanon where the average monthly paymen for refugee is $13 per month, we would be trying to get into Europe And equally, all our experiences around the world shows that the higher you build the wall, the more you empower the smugglers. Desperate people will always get around walls - the solution must be to fix the problems in their homeland. Europe is playing catch-up, says David Miliband. The Syria war started in 2011. And you\u2019ve got to act at the source and in Europe, with a proper relocation process. Germany is showing leadership here, with its promise to screen asylum seekers. And this might sound surprising from the head of a refugee agency, Miliband adds, but: It\u2019s right not just that people are screened, but it\u2019s also right that those who don\u2019t qualify for refugee status shouldn\u2019t stay. It\u2019s absolutely vital to the integrity of the system that the distinction between a refugee, which is someone fleeing persecution, and someone on the other hand who is simply an economic immigrant, needs to be maintained. In the US, where Miliband\u2019s International Rescue charity is based, it has the geographical ability to set up a screening pipeline, and work with the UN to bring people over from the Middle East. Relocation is part of the answer in Europe, but not the whole answer, he concludes. Federica Mogherini, high representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, is arguing that Europe has now woken up to the migration crisis, after a slow start. I don\u2019t see it as a failure that we finally have less people dying at sea. In 2013, I saw the hundreds of people dying at sea in 2013, and not even one summit. Now, we have realised it is a European problem. Yes it took too long, but finally we are doing somthing Is Europe failing on migration? Federino Mogherini argues that Europe can\u2019t afford to fail. In 2015, we learned that European Union is not luxury -- not just the Erasmus student project, a single currency, free movement to go on holiday within European. Finally, the leaders and citizens of Europe have realised that without European union we would not be able to face these challenges of migration and security. So the debate moderator, Lyse Doucet, reads out a readers\u2019 comment that EU leaders are failing and need to stop unlimited entry into Europr. Who in the audience thinks Europe is taking too long to react to this crisis, Doucet asks? There\u2019s a big show of hands. The next session, on the future of Europe, is getting underway shortly. You can watch it here. Miliband (D), Macron, and Mogherini are all on the panel, discussing migration and terrorism. It sounds like today\u2019s session on the Russian economy was quite tasty, with former finance minister Alexey Kudrin clashing with deputy PM Yury Trutnev. We\u2019ll dig the quotes out shortly. In the meantime: Roberto Azev\u00eado, the director general of the World Trade Organisation is in Davos seeking to push forward with trade liberalisation in 2016. He will host a small gathering of trade ministers tomorrow but thinks the mood is positive.\u201d I have never seen talks on trade so exciting. I have never heard the words \u201cWTO\u201d and \u201curgency\u201d in the same sentence\u201d, Azev\u00eado says. That\u2019s perhaps hardly surprising given that the WTO spent the period from November 2001 until last December fruitlessly trying to conclude the Doha round - a comprehensive package that included agriculture, services, manufactured goods, the rules of trade and special help for the poorest countries. Azev\u00eado says the WTO has had to become more flexible, seeking a multilateral deal amongst all its 160-plus members but willing to negotiate coalitions of the willing when unanimity proves impossible. \u201cThe system can work. It is working. We have learned how to live with the different views and the very strong disagreements among our members.\u201d Future areas for talks include e-commerce, investment, digital trade and data flows, Azev\u00eado says. Here\u2019s the Treasury on the UK borrowing figures: Today\u2019s figures show that borrowing is down compared to last year, as a number of one-off factors that have affected the data in recent months have unwound. But there is more to do. At a time when we face a dangerous cocktail of risks from the global economy we must continue to work through our plan to deliver a surplus and provide economic security for working people. And here\u2019s the Office for National Statistics on the disappointing retail sales numbers: Promotions during the 2015 Christmas period were more spread out compared with 2014, with retailers offering discounts over a longer period of time rather than a one day event. Clothing and footwear stores struggled in December due to the milder weather. Meanwhile Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: UK retail sales figures for December always had the potential to be a banana skin for Chancellor George Osborne, and he will be disappointed to see sales slide at such a critical time for the sector. The government would have hoped to see high streets up and down the country flooded with shoppers in the run up to the festive period in a bid to boost the economy, but today\u2019s figures tell a markedly different story. All eyes will now be on the UK\u2019s GDP reading next week to see how much poor retail sales figures have affected the bigger picture. UK public borrowing - excluding state controlled banks - dropped to \u00a37.4bn in December from \u00a311.7bn in December 2014. But chancellor George Osborne - who is warning at Davos of a \u201chazardous mix\u201d of risks to the global economy - will still need a big surplus in next month if he is to reach his full year target of \u00a368.9bn as laid out in the Autumn Statement. Retail sales in the UK came in weaker than expected during the crucial Christmas period. Sales volumes fell 1% in December compared to a 1.3% rise in November - itself revised down from an initial 1.7% increase - and below analysts forecasts of a 0.5% decline. That leaves them up 2.6% year on year, again below expectations of a 3.5% rise. These were the weakest figures since September 2014. UK retail spending fell 1% in December year on year compared to a 0.9% rise in November, the biggest decline since May 2009. The eurozone economy got off to a weaker than expected start to the year, according to the latest data. The Markit composite Purchasing Managers Index - which measures services and manufacturing - fell from 54.3 in December to 53.5 in January in the initial estimates. This was the weakest growth for almost a year, and follows ECB president Mario Draghi\u2019s cautious comments on the effect of the recent oil price slump and market turbulence. Price cutting and a weak euro failed to boost demand, said Markit. But its chief economist Chris Williamson, said it would be wrong to get too worried: The cooling in the pace of growth in euro area business activity at the start of 2016 is a disappointment but not surprising given the uncertainty caused by the financial market volatility seen so far this year. It would be wrong to get too worried. The survey data are consistent with GDP rising at a steady quarterly rate of 0.3-0.4% at the start of the year. Howard Archer at IHG Global Insight said: The January purchasing managers\u2019 surveys for Eurozone manufacturing and services activity are weaker than expected -showing overall expansion moderating to an 11-month low - and raise concerns that heightened global economic uncertainty and financial market turmoil are weighing down on a relatively fragile Eurozone cyclical upturn. Global economic uncertainties and problems are clearly a significant threat to Eurozone growth prospects not only through limiting exports but also potentially weighing down appreciably on business confidence, which could affect employment and investment decisions. Further constraints to Eurozone growth comes from high debt levels in some countries and structural limitations. Nevertheless, the Eurozone January purchasing managers\u2019 surveys are far from disastrous, and they still show reasonable new business growth, rising backlogs of work and decent employment growth. Furthermore, confidence in the services sector was at the highest level since May 2011... However, there are likely to be questions about just how much extra stimulus the ECB is likely to deliver in March having been disappointed in December Here\u2019s our story on the recovery in stock markets: European and Asian stock markets bounced back at the end of a tumultuous week, as oil prices recovered and the European Central Bank president, Mario Draghi, raised hopes of further stimulus measures. It was a week that involved panic selling in global markets, pushing several of them, including London and Japan, into bear market territory, as oil prices tumbled to 13-year lows below $28 a barrel and further intensified fears over the health of the global economy. On Friday, however, Japan\u2019s Nikkei rallied nearly 6%, its biggest one-day gain in four and a half months, helped by a weaker yen and speculation that the Bank of Japan could unveil new stimulus measures at its meeting next week. In Europe, Draghi hinted that the ECB was ready to inject fresh stimulus into the eurozone at the March meeting \u2013 sooner than many investors had been expecting. The comments pulled European markets off their lows on Thursday afternoon, and gave them a further boost on Friday, with the FTSE 100 index in London gaining nearly 100 points, or 1.7%, to 5872.74 in early trading. Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s CAC were both up 1.8% and Spain\u2019s Ibex rose 2%. Earlier came more signs of uncertainty in the eurozone\u2019s economy, confirming ECB president Mario Draghi\u2019s concerns. In France, the manufacturing sector stalled in January although the services sector picked up after the November terror attacks in Paris. Markit\u2019s initial reading for January showed the French manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index falling from 51.4 in December to 50 in January. But the services index rose from 49.8 to a better than expected 50.6, so the composite index - which tracks both sectors - climbed from 50.1 to 50.5 in January. Over in Germany, Markit\u2019s composite Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index fell from 55.5 in December to 54.5 in the preliminary reading for January. This was slightly below expectations. But Markit economist Oliver Kolodseike said the index still suggested growth in the country\u2019s economy, and it appeared unfazed by recent turbulence: Germany\u2019s private sector economy was largely unaffected by the recent stock market turmoil and intensifying uncertainty stemming from the so-called migrant crisis at the beginning of the year, according to latest survey results. Although the headline index (which measures the combined output of manufacturing and service sector firms) fell to a three- month low, the latest reading was higher than the 2015 average and indicative of robust, although unspectacular, growth of the German economy. Is France\u2019s next president at Davos today? Elsewhere in Davos, Harvard professor Ken Rogoff has warned that 2016 is a \u201crough year\u201d for emerging markets, due to the concentration of problems. We don\u2019t quite know what\u2019s happening in China, it\u2019s slowed down significantly. There\u2019s Russia, where the central bank governor did a \u201cwonderful job\u201d letting the ruble flow. They would have been in crisis otherwise. Then there\u2019s Brazil\u2019s huge political problems. Brazil\u2019s recession might be its worse in 100 years. I\u2019m very happy about what\u2019s happening in Argentina, though, Rogoff adds, to his fellow panelist Alfonso Prat-Gay, the new Argentina\u2019s finance minister. Prat-Gay clenches his fists in triumph. But Prat-Gay then warns that Argentina has \u201cunacceptable and immoral\u201d poverty rates of 30%, with 10 million people who cannot make ends meet. So, nothing sensational from Draghi on monetary policy -- but a level-headed argument that Europe could ride out the migration crisis, and a warning that it cannot afford to fail. Q: Is Draghi worried that the \u2018linear\u2019 push towards ever-closer European union is faltering? Draghi isn\u2019t convinced by this argument. I don\u2019t think it was ever meant to be a linear process. The founders of the EU, because they were pretty intelligent, they expected some bumps on the way. On Greece, Mario Draghi says Europe is in a much better situation than last June. The Greek government has made progress on reforms, and fiscal consolidation. Negotiations are taking place right now [between Greek officials and its creditors] There are three areas of interest: The fiscal targets for 2018-19 Pension reforms - which seems to be a \u2018key point\u2019, Draghi says. Financial sector reforms . There are still a high-level of non-performing loans in Greek banks. So we need a process by which these loans can be sold. I\u2019m pretty sure that an agreement will be found, so that the first review can be swiftly concluded, Draghi conclu The sooner it\u2019s concluded, the sooner the Greek economy can go back to normal, Draghi concludes. As ECB president Mario Draghi speaks in Davos, his comments on Thursday suggesting there may be further stimulus measures at the bank\u2019s meeting in March continue to give a boost to markets. At the open in Europe, the FTSE 100 has jumped 100 points or 1.7%, while Germany\u2019s Dax is up 1.8%, France\u2019s Cac has climbed more than 2% and Spain\u2019s Ibex is up nearly 2%. The refugees heading to Europe are a challenge and an opportunity for Europe, says Mario Draghi. Our society will be changed by this. In which direction, we can only guess. It is also premature to know how long it till take to transform this challenge into an opportunity. But if there is determination, and confidence. that\u2019s the most important thing, because the size of the challenge could actually undermine the confidence and make fear prevail over any other consideration. And the challenge is lost. Right now, we are all working to make it into an opportunity, the ECB president adds. But we mustn\u2019t underestimate the scale of the crisis - the education levels of the refugees, their age, and the willingness of the European countries themselves to invest and co-operate. Draghi says he\u2019s also confident that a way will be found to share the financial burden of the refugee crisis across Europe. Not to co-operate would be to ignore the challenge, and that would not make it disappear. Mario Draghi, head of the European Central Bank, is discussing the European economy now. He has warned that Euro governments will have to spend more to tackle the refugee crisis. In economic terms, that works out as a fiscal stimulus that could actually push up Europe\u2019s anaemic growth rate. Draghi is also blaming the slump in the oil price, and problems in the emerging markets, for pushing Europe\u2019s inflation outlook even lower. Having made her announcement, Christine Lagarde is now being congratulated by fellow Davos delegates while she snatches a quick breakfast. Two security guards just made it very clear that she\u2019s not speaking to the press right now. Lagarde\u2019s term of office ends in July. Yesterday, Osborne said she was an \u2018outstanding leader\u2019, who would take the world economy forward. But she does also face the prospect of trial in a French court over the Tapie Affair, so there could be a few twists in this tale yet. Breaking news from Davos- Christine Lagarde, managing director of the IMF, has said she will run for a second term. She made the announcement on French TV a few minutes ago, having already been nominated by several finance ministers, including George Osborne. Lagarde said: \u201cI am candidate to a new mandate. I was honoured to receive from the start of the process the backing of France, Britain, Germany, China, Korea.\u201d Super Mario Draghi seems to have done it again. Ahead of his speech to Davos the ECB president has lifted markets with his hints of further stimulus at the bank\u2019s March meeting. Also helping was talk from Saudi Arabia of a recovery in oil prices later this year, which has pushed Brent Crude more than 5% higher to $30.81 a barrel. So on Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped... while in Asia the Nikkei soared nearly 6% and the Hang Seng 3%. A tumultuous week looks set for a positive end. That even applies to the Shanghai Composite, which is up 1.3% on the day and 0.5% on the week - a surprising outcome given the chaos in the markets over the past few days. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: A sharp rebound in crude oil as well as some warm words from ECB President Mario Draghi turned out to be the perfect ingredients to prompt a sharp snapback in equity markets yesterday after Wednesday\u2019s rout, and this rebound has spilled over into the Asia session with crude oil recovering above the $30 level. The big question now is whether this marks a medium term base, or just a minor relief rally before another leg lower. Given yesterday\u2019s rebound and the subsequent positive session in Asia there now remains the very real possibility that we could well finish the week in positive territory, and if that happens it would be a remarkable turnaround after Wednesday\u2019s carnage. The opening calls for Europe from IG show an upbeat start: Good morning from Davos, where the third day of the World Economic Forum is getting underway. There\u2019s a big focus on geopolitics today, with US secretary of state John Kerry giving a big keynote address. The migration crisis is also in focus, as Europe braces for another inflow of refugees from the turmoil in the Middle East. Overnight, France\u2019s prime minister, Manuel Valls, has warned that the crisis is destabilising Europe. But there\u2019s no escape from economic worries - European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi is due to address Davos shortly. Investors around the world will be watching closely; yesterday, Draghi hinted that the ECB could take fresh action in March. Meanwhile, UK prime minister David Cameron and chancellor George Osborne will be going round Davos, trying to stir British businesses into supporting them in the EU referendum. And Argentina\u2019s president, Mauricio Macri, is in town. Might he mention the Falklands Islands? Here\u2019s some of the things we\u2019ll try to cover: 8.45am CET (7.45am GMT): Mario Draghi discusses the outlook for the eurozone economy 10.30am: Securing the Middle East and North Africa, with Iraqi prime minister Ha\u00efdar Al Abadi and Lebanon\u2019s Tammam Saeb Salam. 11am CET : Europe at a tipping point: with French economy Emmanuel Macron, EU foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini, and David Miliband, President, International Rescue Committee 11.30am CET: John Kerry\u2019s special address 1.15pm CET: Press conference with the President of Argentina, Mauricio Macri, 4.45pm CET: Preparing for the next pandemic, including Bill Gates and Jim Kim, head of the World Bank.",

          "bodyText": "And finally, here\u2019s our news story about today\u2019s drama: And that\u2019s all for tonight. Back tomorrow. GW Phew! Today\u2019s stock market rout is over, with Wall Street posting chunky losses - but not as bad as it looked earlier. The Dow Jones closed 245 points, or 1.5%, in the red - bad, but better than the 500+ slump that had Davos attendees gasping earlier today. As if today wasn\u2019t dramatic enough - Deutsche Bank has issued a profit warning: In another significant move, Joe Biden has used his trip to Davos to urge executives to fight for the right of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. Reuters has got the story: The issue is on the official agenda for the first time at the World Economic Forum, where political leaders from countries that discriminate against gay people, such as Nigeria and Russia, schmooze business leaders and billionaire investors. Biden told U.S. executives including Nathan Blecharczyk, co-founder of apartment-sharing firm Airbnb, Muhtar Kent, chairman and CEO of The Coca Cola Company, and Anthony Scaramucci, founder of hedge fund SkyBridge Capital, to push for change. \u201cYou can change the terms of debate,\u201d he said. \u201cYou actually put governments on notice.\u201d He said he and President Barack Obama privately raise the issue of repression of the LGBT community when they meet political leaders. \u201cI have had some run-ins with at least four heads of state already on this,\u201d said Biden More here: Biden urges U.S. business in Davos to lean on anti-gay states Joe Biden is giving quite a progressive speech tonight at Davos. He\u2019s telling the heads of the world\u2019s biggest businesses that they need to ensure basic protection for workers are the world economy embraces the 4th industrial revolution. Joe Biden also cited one of the statistics of the week - the continued concentration of wealth among the very richest. Joe Biden, the vice-president of the United States, has given the final keynote speech of the day. He started by joking with Christine Lagarde in the audience, saying that he might need some money. Not for a bailout deal (things aren\u2019t that bad today!), but for his own purposes: Whenever I see you, Christine, you say \u201cI know, Greece. I know, Ukraine\u201d. But this time I need a personal loan. But then he turns to the issue of the 4th industrial revolution. It is creating new jobs, and even creating new industries. But will it actually transform the global economy? And will it be for better, or worse? Those who think we must get used to the new normal of slower growth are mistaken, Biden says. Technology is improving productivity, and it can create employment - he cites ride-sharing companies are taking on more staff. And \u201castounding\u201d breakthroughs in science will save lives. But there are dangers, and we must be pro-active. Biden says: How will the warehouse worker who used to ship your order, or the salesman who used to take it, make a living when they are no longer needed? And he goes on to warn that the old relationship between work and wages has been broken, and employees aren\u2019t getting a fair deal: \u201cThe Dow Jones industrial average is down over 500 points\u201d, whispers one Davos attendee. And they\u2019re right. The Dow has shed 536 points, or 3.3%, right now to leave it at 15,475 points. Alexis Tsipras, the Greek prime minister, just whisked through the Davos conference room with a hall entourage. He wasn\u2019t taking press questions, alas, but did share a quick, friendly handshake with Finland\u2019s finance minister, Alex Stubb. I guess relations are warmer than last year, during the months of debt negotiations. Tsipras is meeting with several top officials during his visit, including Christine Lagarde of the IMF. He\u2019s hoping to make persuade them that Athens is making progress, and should be given some leeway on austerity and debt relief. But there is concern that the IMF will take a tough line on pension reform, threatening to reignite the debt crisis again.... US oil prices crashed below $27 for the first time since 2003 after the International Energy Agency warned on Tuesday that the oil market could \u201cdrown in oversupply\u201d. Venezuela requested an emergency Opec meeting to discuss steps to shore up oil prices, but other delegates dismissed the idea. New York light crude tumbled 5.5% to $26.89 a barrel on Wednesday, while Brent crude, the global benchmark, lost 4.2% to $27.56. Plunging oil prices piled further pressure on global stock markets. London\u2019s leading index, the FTSE 100, slid 203.22 points, or 3.5%, to 5673.58. Germany\u2019s Dax tumbled 272.57 points, or 2.8%, to 9391.64 and France\u2019s CAC lost 147.31 points, or 3.5%, to 4124.95. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones has plunged more than 400 points to 15,62.42, a 2.6% drop. The Nasdaq shed 115 points to 4361.53, also a 2.6% fall. Back to Davos, and the Pope has sent a message to politicians and business leaders attending WEF - don\u2019t forget the poorest in society. Pope Francis warned that \u201csoulless machines\u201d should not be allowed to muscle humans out of work, saying: \u201cTo all of you I appeal once more: \u2018Do not forget the poor!\u2019 He continued: Weeping for other people\u2019s pain does not only mean sharing in their sufferings, but also and above all realising that our own actions are a cause of injustice and inequality. Once we realise this, we become more fully human, since responsibility for our brothers and sisters is an essential part of our common humanity. Do not be afraid to open your minds and hearts to the poor. In this way, you will give free rein to your economic and technical talents, and discover the happiness of a full life, which consumerism of itself cannot provide.\u201d Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, has summed up the action on financial markets: FTSE bears have been enjoying themselves today, as the index touches levels not seen since late 2012. The UK market has not been alone, as Europe and now the US join in with the panic of January 2016. Bond yields are heading lower too as investors shun risky assets and stash their money in any safe place going. The main driver of the falls continues to be oil, which has pushed onwards to fresh lows, taking oil stocks with it. A fresh downgrade to IMF growth forecasts underlines what stock markets are telling investors \u2013 that things are looking gloomy across the board.\u201d While we were quizzing Ken Rogoff, Adam Posen, et al, Iranian officials have been taking a pop at Saudi Arabia. Foreign minister Javad Zarif argued that the Saudi\u2019s are to blame for the crisis in the Middle East. The Telegraph has the details. Zarif claimed that: \u201cSaudi Arabia has tried to keep the old staus quo in our region because they don\u2019t think change is in their interest. They unnecessarily panicked and created a lot of mess in our region. And Mohammad Agha Nahavandian, the chief of staff to Iranian prime minister Rouhani, has apparently said Iran will \u2018certainly\u2019 raise oil exports to the levels before sanctions were imposed (they were lifted last week, of course). That\u2019s likely to further inflame tensions within Opec, and keep pressure on the oil price. The sell-off in global market is gathering pace. The Dow Jones is now down more than 400 points, or 2.6%, at 15,593.72. The FTSE 100 index in London has tumbled nearly 230 points, or 3.9%, to 5649.55. Germany\u2019s Dax has lost 335 points, or 3.5%, falling to 9329.09, while France\u2019s CAC is down nearly 180 points to 4087.42, a 4.2% fall. Spot US crude oil futures have dropped below $27 a barrel, the lowest since September 2003, following a warning from the world\u2019s energy watchdog that the oil market could \u201cdrown in oversupply\u201d. Adam Posen, the Peterson Institute director who used to set UK interest rates, has also discussed the crisis with us. He\u2019s not desperately alarmed: \u201cI don\u2019t think we are on the edge of another financial crisis. I don\u2019t even think we are on the edge of another crash. The idea that things are as over-valued as they were last time is false.\u201d Posen said governments should be taking advantage of low interest rates to improve public infrastructure, called on China to boost the economy by creating a social safety net and said central banks should avoid making mistakes. \u201cAt the margin I am not sure the Federal Reserve did the right thing by raising rates last month but I am not sure it was a big mistake. But if the Bank of England or the ECB raised rates, that would be a big mistake.\u201d We\u2019ve now grabbed some time with Ken Rogoff, former IMF chief economist and now economics professor at Harvard, to discuss the market turmoil, and the global economy. Rogoff reckons the problems were concentrated in emerging markets. Asked whether the world was on the edge of another crisis, Rogoff said: \u201cIt feels to me that there is a panic in the markets that doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into the real economy.\u201d Rogoff said that emerging markets would suffer in 2016, but that the US and Europe were \u201csolid\u201d. He added: \u201cIf China goes from 7% growth to minus 2% growth then everybody will be in recession. If it goes to 3-4% growth it will probably not be enough to cause a recession in the developed world. But it is definitely a very precarious situation for emerging markets.\u201d Rogoff said it would help if Chinese policy makers won back the credibility they had lost by their \u201cfoolish\u201d attempts trying to control the stock market and the exchange rate. \u201cIt\u2019s like trying to control the weather. They should let the exchange rate and the stock market find their own level. This is the third leg of the debt super-cycle. First is was the US, then it was Europe, now it is China.\u201d Bob Diamond\u2019s concerns about liquidity (see earlier post) have also been echoed by a top IMF official earlier today: Speaking on a panel, deputy director Min Zhu said: \u201cThe key issue is that liquidity could drop dramatically, and that scares everyone.\u201d \u201cIf everybody is moving together we don\u2019t have any liquidity at all. We have to be ready to act very fast.\u201d Hat-tip to AEP... Canada\u2019s new prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has urged Davos attendees to invest more in his country, in one of his first appearances on the international stage since winning power. Trudeau jokes that while Davos is lovely, business leaders should really check out Whistler (the Canadian ski resort). And on the big issue of WEF, the rise of the robots, Trudeau warns that technology needs to serve the cause of human progress, and growth only succeeds if everyone benefits from it. He also argues that Canada can ride out the oil price slump: We\u2019ve also collared Dennis Nally, chairman of PricewaterhouseCoopers, to talk about the turmoil in the markets. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether we are heading for another crash but unquestionably the environment is clearly having an effect on markets, on everything that is going on here and on the attitudes that exist here in Davos. Confidence levels are down, the volatility we are seeing, There are more threats today than ever. How bad could it get? Who knows. Some people are speculating oil could reach $10 a barrel. I don\u2019t think any of us know. All of this uncertainty has a direct impact on confidence levels\u201d. What should be done? \u201cThere needs to be more dialogue about how [bring] to stability back into the system. I believe there is a disconnect between government, regulators and business\u201d. Bob Diamond, the banker who was forced out of Barclays during the Libor rigging crisis, says there\u2019s no comparison between the situation today and in 2008. Diamond, who has now founded a banking operation called Altas Mara which is expanding across Africa, says: \u201cIt Is a correction, a heathy correction. A lot of people are trying to compare it to 2008, but during the last quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009 we probably had the deepest economic correction I have seen. I don\u2019t see us going into that position. The US economy is still strong, Europe is doing surprising well - the easier monetary policy led by governor [of the European Central Bank Mario] Draghi has sown some positives. There is a correction in China.. If china slows down to 6 or 7% (growth) is that a success? That\u2019s fine\u201d He also suggests that new regulations brought in since 2008 aren\u2019t helping to calm the markets: \u201cA lot of people are taking about where is the liquidity, where are the buyers? Basel three, Volcker rule, ring fenced banks, buffer upon buffer of capital. Are we surprised there is less liquidity from the banks?\u201d Here\u2019s one jot of good news, Nouriel Roubini, Davos\u2019s own doctor doom and the economist who predicted the last crash doesn\u2019t think it is going to be that bad this time. \u201cIt is not going to be like 2008-09. There is not the excessive leverage in the financial system that there was last time.\u201d But 2016 is going to be a bumpy year until central banks respond, Roubini warns. \u201dThe big thing that should happen is China should stop kicking the can down the road and get on with some serious structural reforms\u201d. Roubini is also concerned about the impact of smarter technology: To no one\u2019s great surprise, the US markets have followed the rest of the world and moved sharply lower in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 271 points or 1.7% while the S&amp;P 500 has fallen more than 1% and Nasdaq has lost 1.5%. Sir Roger Carr, chairman of BAE Systems, said: I think we\u2019re witnessing a collision of events which has provoked an immediate sense of crisis. Whether it\u2019s commodities, China, oil prices, terrorism, geopolitical turbulence, all have landed particularly in the month of January and there is an immediate impact which is reflected in the stock market. At the moment what is being discounted are some of the positives that come out of low oil prices in economic terms. It is only being looked at in the lens of bad news. It is too early to say whether this is a crisis of lasting proportion but I think we should certainly continue to focus on addressing the challenges that are there for all. China may have slowed down but it\u2019s not stopped. Europe is fragile but is focused on improvement and with the UK\u2019s engagement in encouraging a more competitive Europe. America still has the fundamentals of an entrepreneurial spirit, self sufficiency in energy. When you look to the positive, while things are far from perfect, we are not at the point of absolute crisis. Back in Davos and Gavin Patterson, chief executive of BT, was asked if we were on the brink of another crisis. He replied: On the balance of probabilities no, but it is very finely balanced. It is an unstable environment. In terms of doing business, I\u2019ve just been at a lunch and most of the CEOs there say most of the underlying businesses are pretty good. If there is contagion in financial markets into the business markets that is going to affect confidence and that\u2019s when we could see a slow down. How bad? We\u2019ve got to be used to a period of time when the world is just more volatile and we have to be able to live and manage through those sort of conditions. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to go away. There could be quite significant swings but the underlying number when it\u2019s evened out will be fine. What can be done? We need the financial markets to settle down and hope that confidence remains strong and that it doesn\u2019t affect people\u2019s underlying desire to do business. What is really going in China is a big [concern], elections and referendum around the world is an issue and the state of things in the Middle East which have a knock on effect. The US inflation figures suggest there may only be one Federal Reserve rate rise this year, says Rob Carnell of ING Bank: US CPI for December fell 0.1% month on month versus a consensus 0.0% month on month expectation. Energy prices were down 2.4% month on month, and food prices also fell for a second consecutive month. But it is the weakness in the service sector inflation component that probably caught the consensus out the most. At only +0.1% month on month, this was down on the trend 0.2-0.3% growth in service sector prices over recent months, and may reflect a slightly weaker growth profile in residential rents, though it has to be said that the weakness in services was not confined to rentals, and was reflected also in areas such as recreation and education. Goods (commodities prices) were as ever, very weak (down 0.1% month on month excluding food and energy, down 2.1% year on year). At this stage, with the market looking for no further Fed rate hikes until the second half of 2016, and only one rate hike in total this year, it is our own forecasts with two further rate hikes, one in June, and another in the fourth quarter of 2016, that look more in need of amendment than the market view. The Fed dot diagram suggestion for four further hikes this year looks utterly out of touch with reality, if anyone was still paying any attention to this. In the US, the consumer price index fell 0.1% month on month in December after being unchanged the previous month. Analysts had been expected the index to also remain flat in December, but the falling oil price helped push it lower. But the year on year figure rose 0.7%, following a 0.5% gain in November. The core CPI, which strips out energy and food costs, rose 0.1% month on month after rising 0.2% for the previous three months, and 2.1% year on year. Meanwhile US housing starts fell 2.5% in December, adding to worries about the strength of the US economy. Goldman Sachs has reported a drop in profits for the fourth straight quarter, hit by a $5bn settlement related to sales of mortgage bonds during the financial crisis. The bank\u2019s fourth quarter earnings fell 71.8% to $574m, with its results also affected by the plunge in oil prices, the slowdown in the Chinese economy and US rate rises. The slump in oil prices has sent the rouble to a new record low. The Russian currency fell to 80.92 to the dollar before recovering to 80.85, still down 2.8% on the day. The fall comes amid fears that the commodity-dependent Russian economy could be further hit by the continuing slide in crude prices. London\u2019s leading index has fallen into bear market territory, defined as 20% below its recent peak. The FTSE 100 has fallen to 5688, down more than 3% as the oil price continues to slide amid concerns about oversupply and lack of demand. Worries about the outlook for China have rattled global markets, not helped by gloomy comments from the World Economic Forum in Davos. The leading index has now fallen more than 20% from its intra-day peak of 7122, reached in April last year. Meanwhile Germany\u2019s Dax is down 2.9% and France\u2019s Cac has fallen 3.4%. Brent crude is currently 2.7% lower at $27.98 a barrel. Just grabbed a word with Philip J. Jennings, general secretary of UNI Global Union, about the turmoil in the markets. Are we heading into a crash? Yes, we are heading for a crash, I\u2019m worried about it. Emerging markets were meant to pull us through this crisis. but China is slowing, and the impact will ripple out across the developing economy. And the jobs situation across the global economy will not improve How bad could it get? We are worried abut the economic climate - how deep the crash will be. Those RBS analysts [who said to sell everything] may be right - \u201ccataclysm\u201d could be the right word to use. What should be done? We need leadership. The G20 needs to fulfil the promise they made at the last financial crisis, to not just save the banking sector but to also put the economy back on track. The private sector need to understand that lack of investment isn\u2019t helping, and we need to push wages higher. The G20 needs to put demand back in the economy. Some customers at Italy\u2019s Monte dei Paschi bank have started withdrawing their savings, according to its chief executive. The bank is struggling with its bad loans and has seen its stock market value have this year. Reuters reports: Chief executive Fabrizio Viola did not say how much money savers had withdrawn, or when the outflow began, though he said the fall in deposits was \u201climited\u201d and that the bank could cope with it as he sought to reassure customers and investors. Italian bank shares have lost 20% so far this year as investors, already rattled about global economic growth, have sold out of a sector with low profitability and about 200 billion euros ($218 billion) of loans that are unlikely to be repaid. Monte Paschi - Italy\u2019s third-biggest bank - has lost the most ground as it is perceived to be the most vulnerable; it has the highest level of bad loans as a proportion of assets and was the worst performer in a health check of eurozone lenders in 2014. The Tuscan-based bank\u2019s stock, which had plunged 15% on Monday and 14.4% on Tuesday, was suspended from trading several times after falling 18.2% on Wednesday. The plunge helped dragged down all other Italian banking stocks, with Carige shedding 12.7% and Banco Popolare falling more than 6%. Viola said the plunge in Monte Paschi shares was not a reflection of the bank\u2019s fundamentals, which he said had improved in the last quarter of 2015. \u201cOf course clients turning to our local branches are worried about what they read,\u201d Viola said in a statement. \u201cAt present the size of the funding lost due to clients who decided to move part of their savings elsewhere is limited and anyway below levels seen during the previous crisis the bank faced in February 2013 which was overcome brilliantly.\u201d The 2013 crisis he was referring to was when the world\u2019s oldest bank, already badly weakened by the euro zone debt crisis, was hit by a scandal about loss-making derivatives trades... \u201cOver the past few days many have been wondering about the pace at which people closed their accounts and sold bank bonds,\u201d said Giuseppe Sersale, a fund manager at Anthilia Capital Partners. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it a bank run but there are definitely outflows,\u201d he added. Meanwhile, there are reports of Italian government meetings to discuss the problems in the country\u2019s banking sector: Here\u2019s some words of comfort amid the gloom. European economics commissioner Pierre Moscovici does not believe there will be a repeat of the financial crisis, nor does he think the eurozone\u2019s growth outlook will be changed in the next EC forecasts. And he says central banks still have actions they can take to tackle any further slowdown, even if interest rates are at record lows and plenty of stimulus measures have already been taken. Reuters reports from an interview with Moscovici: Central banks still have more firepower they can use to counter a slowdown in global growth, which does not change the outlook for recovery in the eurozone, European Economics Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said on Wednesday. In an interview with Reuters Television at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Moscovici said he did not believe there would be any return to an international financial crisis, despite turmoil in world markets during the first few weeks of 2016 triggered by China\u2019s slowdown and low oil prices. Asked whether the world\u2019s main central banks had run out of ammunition to revive the global economy after years of record low interest rates and quantitative easing, he said: \u201cThey have got guns and they can act.\u201d Moscovici said he did not expect any major change in the euro zone\u2019s growth outlook when the European Commission issues an updated forecast in early February, despite the sharp slowdown in China and tumbling stock and commodity markets. The EU executive last forecast in November that the euro zone would grow by 1.8 percent this year and 1.9 percent in 2017 after an estimated 1.6 percent last year. \u201cAs I see it today I see no change, no major change in our forecast... for Europe. But of course we\u2019ve got to take into account those downside risks. We don\u2019t need to change our policy stance but to reinforce it,\u201d he said. On global market turbulence and falling commodity prices, Moscovici said: \u201cI don\u2019t feel that the financial crisis is coming back. We don\u2019t feel that we are facing the risk of a breakdown in world growth, but there are downsides that we need to address. The IMF has also weighed in on migration, saying it can be positive. A new report predicts a short-term boot to GDP in countries who take refugees in, and long-term benefits if migrants are integrated well. IMF chief Christine Lagarde has also tried to crush worries that migrants will drive wages down: More on capital flows. The amount of money flowing out of emerging markets, especially China, was much worse than expected last year, according to a report from the Institute of International Finance. In October the finance industry group forecast net outflows from emerging markets of $540bn. Now it says the figure was $735bn, with $676bn from China, as investors pulled out of emerging markets and Chinese companies hurried to pay off overseas loans as the country\u2019s currency depreciated. The institute said: Net capital outflows from emerging markets in 2015 were even larger than we previously thought. We now estimate total net capital outflows (including unrecorded flows captured by net errors and omissions) at $735 billion, up from outflows of $111 billion in 2014. The bulk of these outflows relate to China, driven in part by repayment of corporate foreign currency liabilities in the face of concerns about a weakening currency. We estimate total capital outflows from China amounted to $676 billion in 2015\u2014including $216 billion in unrecorded outflows in errors and omissions. Other emerging markets also experienced net capital outflows, as non-resident inflows slumped on broader concerns about emerging market growth performance and corporate indebtedness. For 2016, we expect continued net capital outflows albeit at a somewhat more moderate pace. The impact of the Fed\u2019s shift to a tightening cycle may be limited as long as it is gradual, but flows to emerging markets will continue to face headwinds from growth and debt concerns. HSBC CEO Stuart Gulliver spoke to reporters after he had finished talking about climate change. Asked about the financial market turmoil, he said that part of the movement was \u201cself fulfilling\u201d as investors liquidated positions to make margin calls on positions. \u201cYou always get an overshoot in times of significant sell offs\u201d. He also warned there could be more sell-offs. \u201cI think we will see further adjustments before we hit equilibrium. We\u2019ll see a little more sell offs before we see equilibrium but we\u2019re closer equilibrium than we were a couple of weeks ago, we\u2019re towards the end of this sort of sell off\u201d. He indicated that growth in China was strong and that yesterday\u2019s figures were 30% of the entire Chinese economy in 2005. The bank is currently deciding whether to keep its headquarters in the UK. Gullliver said an update would be made by the time of the results of February 22. Nariman Behravesh, chief economist of IHS, has some interesting thoughts on China, where he thinks policy makers in Beijing will respond to pressure on the yuan by quietly bringing back capital controls. \u201cThere has been a massive amount of capital flight - around $1 trillion since last summer\u201d Behravesh said. \u201cThat puts huge downward pressure on the exchange rate. The question is what happens next.\u201d \u201cThe first thing that policy makers could do is to let the currency go. That would result in a devaluation of 15-20%. That would have horrible consequences. It could trigger a global currency war and a global recession.\u201d The second thing they could do is keep using foreign currency reserves, but there are limits to that.\u201d Finally, either explicitly or implicitly, they could bring back capital controls\u201d. Behravesh said the third approach would run counter to the reform agenda of China\u2019s leaders, who have expressed a desire for greater financial liberalisation. \u201cBut there are no good options. The least bad option would be capital controls.\u201d Behravesh said there were already signs that China was making it harder for people to take money out of the country. He said the credibility of the Chinese leadership had been undermined by their handling of the financial turbulence since last summer. \u201cThe scary thing has been the ineptitude of Chinese policy makers, who panicked when the stock market fell last August and panicked again at the beginning of this year. They want reform but they don\u2019t really trust markets.\u201d Joachim Gauck, the president of Germany, is addressing the Davos Congress Hall now. He begins by touching on the migration crisis, which is a growing domestic issue in Germany after chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s liberal refugee policy. Almost 60 million are trying to escape war and conflict, and it is presenting the European Union with its biggest ever test, he says. Migration isn\u2019t a new problem, it\u2019s been around for decades as people try to escape from peril, find a better life. He then quotes JK Galbraith, who said that migration was the oldest action against poverty. A look at the list of American Nobel laureates and Oscar price winners shows just how much a country can benefit from migrants\u2019 creativity, Gauck says. Migration, and integration, must be thought of in tandem, he says. But it is our \u201chumanitarian responsibility\u201d to take in people who are fleeing the refugee crisis. He also explains that Germany feels a moral obligation to help, having \u2018fallen so low\u2019 in the past (a reference to the second world war). This may not calm the rebellion within her own party, from those who believe Germany needs to cut the number of migrants entering the country: Update: Gauck goes on to warn that limits may need to be set. Associated Press has a good take: The president of Germany says that limiting the number of refugees entering Europe is necessary and \u201cmorally acceptable\u201d if the continent is to continue to provide help to those in need. While stressing the \u201chumanitarian responsibility\u201d of taking in victims of persecution, Joachim Gauck told a conference in Davos, Switzerland, that Germany and European countries must limit the numbers of people who want to come in to avoid being overwhelmed. My colleague Jill Treanor has spoken to HSBC\u2019s CEO Stuart Gulliver - he has admitted that the bank may not have a decision on whether it is moving its bank out of the UK by next month\u2019s financial results. Al Gore, former US vice-president, says last month\u2019s Paris agreement showed that the world is prepared to do what\u2019s needed to tackle climate change. 195 nations said yes, we will change. The direction of travel has been established....and that message has been received by the World Economic Forum. In Paris, countries committed to keeping global warming down to 1.5 degrees celsius. But there is also disappointment that even more wasn\u2019t achieved. Christiana Figueres, UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, says the Paris talks did not end with an agreement on the carbon price because of the lack of unanimity. \u201cThe Paris agreement had to be unanimous, if there was one country that didn\u2019t agree with the carbon price in 2015 had that been rammed down the throat we would not have had a Paris agreement.\u201d A fixed carbon price would encourage investment in solar and other alternative energy sources, she explains. The stock market sell off is getting worse. The FTSE 100 is now down 170 points or 2.8% at 5706 - only around 20 points off a bear market (20% off its peak). Germany\u2019s Dax is down more than 3% and France\u2019s Cac has fallen 3.3%. The US is unlikely to be much help. Ahead of results from Goldman Sachs and the latest US inflation figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are showing a 329 point decline. Sir Martin Sorrell, chairman of advertising giant WPP, has added his voice to those warning that the world faces slowing growth. The new normal is a low-growth world. Inflation is under too much control, we could do with a bit more of it. That scenario will continue. The system couldn\u2019t sustain pre-Lehman growth rates because it blew up in September 2008. Ken Rogoff, former IMF chief economist and Harvard professor, blamed China for the recent market turbulence. It wasnt due to the Federal Reserve\u2019s \u2018microscopic increase\u2019 in interest rates. He also sees trouble ahead in the developing world: For the next year there is going to be a lot of risk in China and the emerging markets, but not such elevated risks for Europe and the US. Climate change is a big theme at Davos, especially after Leonardo DiCaprio attacked the greed of the energy industry last night. Stuart Gulliver, boss of HBSC, has told one panel that the bank sets tougher lending criteria for coal-fired power stations in emerging markets than those in developed economies. He is also optimistic, he said, about funding alternative energy despite the low oil price. \u201c The public wants to do this,\u201d he said, when asked about funding alternative energy and while the cost of financing for such companies currently high he expected it to fall. He also had a warning about suddenly withdrawing all financing for fossil fuels. There would be \u201cunintended consequences\u201d he said as these companies were major employers and paid tax used by governments to pay for health care etc. Gulliver admitted that HSBC\u2019s annual meeting faced protesters from activists trying to end any investment in fossil fuels. Christiana Figueres, UN expert on climate, insisted she was not one of the activities calling for all carbon fuels to be left in the ground. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, former Nigerian finance minister, has backed the ebola agreement between Gavi and Merck announced today. There was a \u201cshared terror\u201d in Africa last year, she says, during the ebola outbreak in which more than 11,000 people died. Amira Yahyaoui, the Tunisian journalist who is co-chairing this year\u2019s meeting, says the rise of smarter machines (the 4th industrial revolution), should spur humans to understand what makes them human. Speaking on a panel, she says humans are no longer in a monopoly on planet Earth. We are in competition with things that might be better than we are. We are the ones destroying the planet, we are the ones killing humans. So this 4th industrial revolution should maybe be a revolution of values. Yahyaoui also challenged WEF for not achieving gender parity at the forum (although there are three male and three female co-chairs this year, including General Motors boss Mary Barra and International Trade Union chief Sharan Burrow). Eighteen percent of this forum are women, 18 is nothing. I come from a country supposed to be very anti-woman and we are more than 33% women in parliament and we have parity in every election. [WEF has made some efforts on this issue, and offers an extra place to businesses who send at least one female delegate] She\u2019s also concerned that the percentage of people under 30 here is \u201cway less than 18%\u201d. Every generation has been driven by youth, and this one will be too, Yahyaoui continues. Unfortunately, older people love progress, but they hate change, and revolutions are all about change, she concludes. It\u2019s not by improving the candle that we created electricity, and it\u2019s time to create electricity. Geraint Johnes, professor of economics at Lancaster University, said: All regions except London experienced a fall in the unemployment rate, suggesting that the recovery is now well and truly being felt nationwide. The construction industry has continued to play a leading part in the recovery - the number of jobs in this sector has increased by some 77000. Administrative and business support functions have also seen considerable growth - of 50000 jobs - over the latest period. The role played by construction is accentuated further by the continuing high rates of pay increase in that sector. Compared with a year earlier, pay in this sector in November amounted to some 5.6% higher. Taking the economy overall, pay growth remains comparatively muted, at 2.0% - though with negligible price inflation, workers are now experiencing noticeable increases in their real wages. So long as productivity gains can be restored, there is no reason to believe that the increase we are now seeing in pay levels should become inflationary. We should not therefore be expecting an interest rate hike any time soon. And here\u2019s chancellor George Osborne on the day\u2019s data: On the jobs data, James Knightley at ING Bank said: The UK labour data looks pretty decent with employment growth in the three months to November rising 267,000 and the unemployment rate falling to 5.1%, both are better than the 235,000 and 5.2% consensus predictions. However, wage growth did slow close to expectations (ex bonus the three month average is now 1.9% year on year although the single month reading did rise to 2.1% from 1.6%). Consequently, it is an encouraging report that should keep consumer confidence and spending running at healthy levels. However, with Bank of England Governor Mark Carney suggesting there is little appetite for a rate hike any time soon and with the prospect of a Brexit vote set to weigh on activity it looks as though November remains the earliest possible opportunity for a rate rise. Still, sterling has come off its lows following the figures. After hitting a seven year low of $1.4125 it has recovered to $1.4162. Here\u2019s are the average earnings: The government\u2019s plans to cut back the public sector show through in the jobs data. For September 2015, 17.1% of people in employment worked in the public sector, the lowest proportion since comparable records began in 1999. Here\u2019s the Reuters take on the UK data: Wage growth in Britain in the three months to November was its slowest since February, official data showed on Wednesday, the latest sign the Bank of England will take its time before raising interest rates. The slowing in wage growth came even as Britain\u2019s unemployment rate unexpectedly fell to 5.1 percent, its lowest since early 2006, from 5.2 percent in the three months to October. The BoE is keeping a close eye on wage growth as it considers when to raise interest rates at a time when inflation has hovered near zero for months and weakness in the global economy is hurting British output. The unemployment rate of 5.1% was below forecasts of a 5.2% figure. Total weekly earnings rose 2%, compared to expectations of 2.1%. This is also the weakest growth since February. On the wages front, average weekly earnings excluding bonuses rose 1.9% in the three months to November, compared to expectations of a 1.8% rise. This was the weakest growth since February last year. The November figure was 2.1% year on year. For September to November 2015, 74% of people aged from 16 to 64 were in work, the highest employment rate since comparable records began in 1971, according to the Office for National Statistics. The UK December claimant count has fallen 4,300 compared to expectations of a 2,500 rise. The jobless numbers fell 99,000 to 1.675m in the three months to November, meaning the unemployment rate is 5.1%, its lowest since the three months to January 2006. Employment rose by 267,000, the third biggest increase on record. With crude still tumbling - Brent is now down 2.8% at $27.88 a barrel - Shell has spelled out the damage the slump in oil prices is doing to its business. Our energy editor Terry Macalister reports: Shell has warned that its fourth-quarter profits may be 50% lower than last time with full year write-offs as high as $7bn (\u00a35bn), underlining the damage being wreaked on the industry by low crude prices. In the first preliminary results to be reported this year by any of the large oil companies, Shell said it expected earnings to come in at between $1.6bn and $1.9bn and full-year numbers as low as $10.4bn. Further losses will be taken in the last three months of the year, bringing the total amount of writedowns on the sale of assets and other one-off losses to as high as $7bn. The dismal figures ramp up the pressure on Shell\u2019s chief executive, Ben van Beurden, who is trying to justify the \u00a335bn takeover of rival BG which must be agreed by more than 50% of Shell shareholders next week. The full story is here: Gavi, the vaccine group, is announcing a new deal with drugs company Merck to get access to its ebola vaccine. Under the scheme, Merck will make 300,000 doses of the vaccine available in the next few months, for clinical trials and in case there is another outbreak. The vaccine not been fully licenced yet, but testing last year found it was 100% effective in providing protection against ebola. Seth Berkley, the head of Gavi, says there was initially a \u201ccomplete market failure\u201d with ebola, as there was no commercial demand for a vaccine. But the outbreak in 2015, in which more than 11,000 people died, has helped force a rethink. Merck\u2019s product, called VSV-ZEBOV live attenuated Ebola Zaire vaccine, is the most promising available, Berkley says. The suffering caused by the Ebola crisis was a wake-up call to many in the global health industry,\u201d Berkley told an audience at Davos. This agreement means we will be \u201cahead of the curve\u201d next time. The deal will also help Merck to get the vaccine win approval from the World Health Organisation, he added. Gavi is providing $5m to help Merck submit the drug for licensing by the end of 2017. Julie Gerberding, vice-president for public health at Merck, says her company is committed to getting their ebole vaccine fully licenced. She says: The scale and speed of the firestorm in Africa reminded us that mother nature is the best terrorist. It showed that we need to prepare in advance, and also respond quickly when a crisis occurs. And when we have a licenced ebola vaccine, we will make it available at the lowest possible not-for-profit price, Gerberding pledges. Anand Mahindra, director of Indian company Mahinda and Mahindra, is one of the speakers on a panel about the transformation of tomorrow. \u201cI was scared\u201d he said when having dinner in New York and the young girls sitting next to him didn\u2019t talk to each other for 15 minutes while they used their phones. His daughter told him that they would be posting imagines on instagram. \u201cIt was some kind of ghost world,\u201d he said. Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook is sitting alongside him, making the point that tomorrow won\u2019t be transformed while men keep ruling the world. \u201cMen still run the world and I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s going that well\u201d. She conducted a poll of audience - how many women had been told they were too aggressive at work and asked if they should be working. Hands went up. She talked about Facebook\u2019s civil courage initiative to try to end hate on he social network. \u201cThere is no place for hate and intolerance on our platform,\u201d she said. Facebook\u2019s CEO, Sheryl Sandburg, is discussing the future of technology now: In the wake of falls on Asian markets, investors in Europe are seeing heavy losses at the start of trading. The FTSE 100 is down 110 points or 1.8% 5766, its lowest level since November 2012 and less than 100 points off a bear market (down 20% from its all time high last April). Germany\u2019s Dax is down 2.3% while France\u2019s Cac has fallen 2.4% and Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB is down 2.6%. The head of Swiss banking giant UBS, Axel Weber, has added to the angst in Davos by warning that we are stuck in an era of low growth. He pointed out that the International Monetary Fund has consistently been downgrading its short-term growth forecasts, as hopes for a strong recovery have consistently been dashed. Weber says: \u201cLast year the forecast of the IMF for that year was 2% lower than the forecast three years out. It\u2019s just a sign of the fact we are and have moved to a lower growth environment, where the rebound of growth rates we\u2019ve seen in the past we are unlikely to see again soon. We are coming out of biggest global crisis in many decades and it will take time to heal\u201d. Weber also argues that something fundamental has changed - this isn\u2019t just a cyclical phenomenon. And that has left central bankers struggling: As he put it: One of the reasons why growth cannot be reignited is the central banks also have a difficulty to reignite inflation rates. Most of the central banks tell you (their target) is to have inflation rate of around 2%, quantitative easing and massively expanding the balance sheet does not lead to an uptick of inflation close to target at least on the time horizon of one to two years out\u201d. \u201cWe are seeing a low growth, low interest rate environment with low interest rates. We will have to get used to the lower growth environment and low interest rate environment\u201d. Tuesday\u2019s market rally has proved shortlived, with Asian markets down sharply and Europe forecast to follow suit. After rising on talk of growing Chinese demand for oil and hopes of more central bank stimulus to boost the world\u2019s second largest economy, crude is falling back once more. That appears to be a belated reaction to the International Energy Agency saying the market could \u201cdrown in oversupply.\u201d Brent crude is now down nearly 2% at $28.19 a barrel, while WTI is down 3.3% at $27.52. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said the respite from recent negative sentiment has gained little traction: The inability of US markets to hold onto most of its gains was the first clue as oil prices slipped back off their highs once again. Furthermore it is this inability to sustain rebounds for any length of time that continues to gnaw away at investor sentiment in the short term, and keep the pressure on the downside. Here\u2019s our story on the falling Asian markets, with Japan now technically in a bear market: Business leaders in Davos are rather gloomier this year, according to a new report from PricewaterhouseCoopers last night. Terrorism, oil, and China, mean bosses are more worried than at any time in the last 5 years: Good morning from Davos, Switzerland, where the 2016 Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum is getting underway. There\u2019s a bit of snow in the air this morning, and more than a bit of anxiety as global leaders, business chiefs, campaigners, celebrities and the media converge on the small ski resort. This year\u2019s WEF is racked with fears. For example: Will robots devour millions of jobs? How bad is the Chinese economy really? When will the rout in the stock markets end, and does it herald a wave of defaults? Is oil going to hit $20 per barrel, or even $10, and what will that means for petr-exporters? Can the turmoil in the Middle East be tamed? Will Europe sink under the pressure of the refugee crisis? Delegates have a lot on their plates this year, whether they\u2019re mingling in the congress centre or holding top-level meetings behind closed doors. There\u2019s a lot happening today, but here\u2019s a few key events we\u2019ll try to cover: 9am Davos time (8am GMT): Facebook\u2019s Sheryl Sandberg and Microsoft\u2019s Satya Nadella debate the 4th industrial revolution 9.30am: Vaccine group GAVI and Merck announce an ebola vaccine deal 10.30: A session on preventing future shocks in the financial markets, 11.20am: German president Joachim Gauck discusses the migration crisis 3.20pm: Canada\u2019s new PM Justin Trudeau 3.45pm: A session on the refugee crisis, including Queen Rania of Jordan, Peter Maurer of the Red Cross, and Hamdi Ulukaya of Chobani 5.45pm: US vice-president Joe Biden discusses geopolitical security. The full programme is online here. We also get the latest UK unemployment report this morning (9.30am GMT) and US inflation data this afternoon. And while all that\u2019s going on, the stock markets are expected to suffer another bad day. There\u2019s already been a heavy selloff in Asia, and we\u2019re expecting the FTSE 100 to tumble at the open. Here\u2019s the opening calls: UK FTSE: 5767 -110 points German DAX: 9438 -221 French CAC: 4176 -96 Spanish IBEX: 8401 -154 Angus Nicholson of IG says that concerns over China\u2019s slowing economy are building. The somewhat mystifying 3%+ rally in Mainland equities yesterday has proved short-lived and this is likely to punish commodities on European and US exchanges. Some more of the Chinese GDP data has filtered out today and concerns about Chinese economic growth seeing a very weak Q1 in 2016 are growing. So it could be a dramatic day....",

          "bodyText": "Canada\u2019s Conservative opposition has accused Justin Trudeau of overseeing an \u201cincoherent\u201d policy towards the US-led fight against the Islamic State militant group which they say has led to the country\u2019s exclusion from key talks with coalition allies this week. The US defence secretary Ash Carter will meet in Paris with counterparts from the UK, Australia, France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands on Wednesday to discuss broadening the campaign against Isis. Conservatives have seized on Canada\u2019s exclusion from the list to accuse the Liberal government \u2013 and in particular the prime minister, foreign minister Stephane Dion and defence minister Harjit Sajjan \u2013 of sidelining Canada from the fight against Isis. \u201cBecause of the weak response that we\u2019re seeing from Prime Minister Trudeau and mixed messages and incoherence coming from Stephane Dion and Harjit Sajjan, the allies aren\u2019t taking us seriously anymore,\u201d said Conservative defence critic James Bezan. In his first news conference after a sweeping election victory in October, Trudeau pledged to withdraw the country\u2019s fighter jets from operations against Isis in Iraq and Syria while increasing contributions to the campaign\u2019s training and humanitarian efforts. But the government has yet to elaborate on the details of their plan. \u201cThe decision to withdraw Canada\u2019s CF-18s is seen by our allies as stepping back, rather than standing shoulder-to-shoulder with them,\u201d said Bezan. Earlier this week, Sajjan downplayed the fact he would not attend the meeting, noting that he had multiple upcoming meetings with Nato allies, including in Brussels in February. A State Department official said on Tuesday the talks were not a formal coalition gathering but a one-time meeting of defence ministers. Asked about Canada\u2019s exclusion, the official said: \u201cThe United States and Canada are great friends and allies, and together with coalition partners, we will continue to work to degrade and destroy Isil.\u201d Speaking last at Kentucky\u2019s Fort Campbell military base, Carter said the six nations invited to the talks are \u201cplaying a significant role in both the ground and air components\u201d of the campaign and have a \u201csignificant stake in the destruction of Isis\u201d. Carter also noted he would push for greater involvement from current and prospective members in the fight. On Tuesday, the Washington Post story quoted a senior US administration defence official describing the talks as a meeting of nations with \u201cthe most skin in the game together\u201d. The US is seeking more military contributions from its allies in the wake of deadly terror attacks linked to the extremist group in Paris in November and San Bernardino in December. For the moment, six Canadian CF-18 fighter jets are still conducting sorties in Iraq and Syria. Canada is also contributing two surveillance craft and one refuelling tanker to coalition efforts, along with 600 military personnel and 69 special forces who are advising and assisting local forces. Of the countries attending the Paris meeting, only Germany is not involved in airstrikes in Iraq or Syria, although it is flying reconnaissance missions in support of the coalition in the region. In July, under the former Conservative government, Canada hosted an anti-Isis coalition conference co-chaired by the US and Iraq.",

Liberals took a beating in public opinion polls when they voted in support of the legislation, though they promised to repeal its \u201cproblematic elements\u201d if they won the 19 October federal election.</p> <p>They did, and now the bill\u2019s critics \u2013 who say it is too broad, lacks sufficient oversight for national security and law enforcement agencies, and includes a number violations of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, a rights bill embedded in Canada\u2019s constitution \u2013 want to ensure those problems are dealt with in full public view.</p> <p>\u201cBecause it has been such a divisive political issue, I think there is a desire to move it out of the public sphere, especially because of the political damage the Liberal party took in supporting this legislation,\u201d said Paul Finch, treasurer with the British Columbia Government and Service Employees\u2019 Union.</p> <p>\u201cWe want to set the agenda before the (January) legislative session gets going.\u201d</p> <p>While opponents say they are hopeful the government will follow through on its commitment to introduce new legislation, they are concerned that pledge has been moved to the political back burner.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a big issue that got a lot of attention before the election and since the election hasn\u2019t seen much action from the government,\u201d said Laura Tribe of Open Media.</p> <p>\u201cCanadians are not going to let this one slide.\u201d</p> <p>Critics are also concerned the federal government will focus on cosmetic reforms that fail to address the deeper problems they see in the legislation. </p> <p>\u201cAt this point there just needs to be some direction from the government about whether there is going to be a consultation and how deeply they are going to reach into bill C-51,\u201d said Kent Roach, a University of Toronto law professor who has helped lead the attack on the legislation.</p> <p>Goodale\u2019s spokesman, Scott Bardsley, said: \u201cWork on our platform commitments on C-51 is ongoing. The full details will be unveiled in due course.\u201d</p> <p>Those commitments include a guarantee all Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) warrants respect the charter and a statutory review of the full anti-terror act after three years.</p> <p>Bardsley also said the government was planning on holding \u201cbroad consultations\u201d but said he could offer no further details for the moment.</p> <p>Last summer, the Canadian Civil Liberties Association (CCLA) and Canadian Journalists for Free Expression <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/21/canada-anti-terror-lawsuit-bill-c51\">filed a lawsuit arguing that the bill violates the Canada\u2019s constitution</a>. That lawsuit is pending and the CCLA has requested a meeting with the new government.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Tribe said time is of the essence when it comes to tackling the complex reforms.</p> <p>\u201cThe longer bad legislation sits on the books, the longer information is being collected. The longer people are potentially subject to surveillance,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not enough to say, well, no harm has been done yet.\u201d</p>",

          "bodyText": "Opponents of Canada\u2019s sweeping new anti-terror law are planning a major campaign to pressure the Liberal government to launch broad public consultations before overhauling the controversial legislation. Civil society groups, legal scholars and labour unions are calling on the government to hold a public debate on reforms for the legislation \u2013 known as C-51 \u2013 which they say are necessary to protect Canadian civil liberties, freedoms and personal privacy. \u201cWe know very little about the government\u2019s plans for C-51, so our hope is they are going to listen to the huge number of Canadians who expressed deep, deep concerns about this bill when it was passed,\u201d British Columbia Civil Liberties Association executive director Josh Paterson says. \u201cThey need to be very clear on what their intentions are before actually doing anything.\u201d The government has given few details on its plans, though prime minister Justin Trudeau has reiterated his pledge to establish an all-party national security oversight committee. Legislation to form that statutory committee is expected within six months. Federal public safety minister Ralph Goodale is in London this week looking to the UK\u2019s intelligence and security committee of Parliament \u2013 which examines the policy, administration and expenditure of that country\u2019s intelligence agencies \u2013 as a possible model. The opposition Conservatives criticized Goodale on Tuesday for failing to include parliamentarians from other parties in these initial consultations. Bill C-51 provoked widespread outrage when it was passed by the Conservative government last June. Liberals took a beating in public opinion polls when they voted in support of the legislation, though they promised to repeal its \u201cproblematic elements\u201d if they won the 19 October federal election. They did, and now the bill\u2019s critics \u2013 who say it is too broad, lacks sufficient oversight for national security and law enforcement agencies, and includes a number violations of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, a rights bill embedded in Canada\u2019s constitution \u2013 want to ensure those problems are dealt with in full public view. \u201cBecause it has been such a divisive political issue, I think there is a desire to move it out of the public sphere, especially because of the political damage the Liberal party took in supporting this legislation,\u201d said Paul Finch, treasurer with the British Columbia Government and Service Employees\u2019 Union. \u201cWe want to set the agenda before the (January) legislative session gets going.\u201d While opponents say they are hopeful the government will follow through on its commitment to introduce new legislation, they are concerned that pledge has been moved to the political back burner. \u201cIt was a big issue that got a lot of attention before the election and since the election hasn\u2019t seen much action from the government,\u201d said Laura Tribe of Open Media. \u201cCanadians are not going to let this one slide.\u201d Critics are also concerned the federal government will focus on cosmetic reforms that fail to address the deeper problems they see in the legislation. \u201cAt this point there just needs to be some direction from the government about whether there is going to be a consultation and how deeply they are going to reach into bill C-51,\u201d said Kent Roach, a University of Toronto law professor who has helped lead the attack on the legislation. Goodale\u2019s spokesman, Scott Bardsley, said: \u201cWork on our platform commitments on C-51 is ongoing. The full details will be unveiled in due course.\u201d Those commitments include a guarantee all Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) warrants respect the charter and a statutory review of the full anti-terror act after three years. Bardsley also said the government was planning on holding \u201cbroad consultations\u201d but said he could offer no further details for the moment. Last summer, the Canadian Civil Liberties Association (CCLA) and Canadian Journalists for Free Expression filed a lawsuit arguing that the bill violates the Canada\u2019s constitution. That lawsuit is pending and the CCLA has requested a meeting with the new government. Meanwhile, Tribe said time is of the essence when it comes to tackling the complex reforms. \u201cThe longer bad legislation sits on the books, the longer information is being collected. The longer people are potentially subject to surveillance,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to say, well, no harm has been done yet.\u201d",

          "bodyText": "The company behind the rejected Keystone XL pipeline fired off two legal challenges on Wednesday, accusing Barack Obama of overstepping his authority and violating the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). TransCanada Corporation said it was looking to recover an estimated $15bn it spent over many years trying to win approval for the pipeline before Obama rejected the project last November. \u201cTransCanada asserts the US administration\u2019s decision to deny a presidential permit for the Keystone XL pipeline was arbitrary and unjustified,\u201d the company said in a press release. The twin legal challenges \u2013 a lawsuit filed in a federal court in Texas on Wednesday and notice of intent to sue under provisions of the Nafta treaty \u2013 threaten to revive the longest-running environmental and political dispute of Obama\u2019s administration. It was far from clear, however, whether the suits would get the pipeline built, given record low oil prices and the election of a new government in Canada which is trying to set a more climate-friendly policy. The company in a statement acknowledged the US had never lost a Nafta lawsuit. The US and Canada had hoped to open a new chapter on Keystone and climate change policy, with Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, due to visit the White House on 10 March. Trudeau, though a supporter of Keystone, had promised a sharp break with the pro-oil policies of his conservative predecessor, Stephen Harper. At the Paris climate negotiations last month, both countries teamed up in a \u201chigh ambition coalition\u201d pressing for stricter temperature limits. With oil prices falling to an 11-year low of $35 a barrel on Wednesday, many experts believe the Keystone XL project may no longer be economically viable. The pipeline was designed to pump crude from the tar sands of Alberta across the US to refineries on the Texas gulf coast \u2013 but spent years in limbo after running into strong opposition from climate campaigners and Nebraska ranchers. At the same time, Keystone XL became a symbol for Republicans in Congress of Obama\u2019s willingness to resort to executive power to move his agenda forward. TransCanada said in a statement that it had had every expectation that the project would be approved during the permitting process \u2013 and alleged that Obama\u2019s rejection was swayed by politics, not the merits of the pipeline. \u201cThe denial reflected an unprecedented exercise of presidential power and intruded on Congress\u2019s power under the constitution to regulate interstate and international commerce,\u201d TransCanada said. There was no immediate comment from the White House or state department. John Hoeven, the Republican senator from North Dakota who brought a bill to wrest the decision over Keystone out of Obama\u2019s hands, said the president had ignored public opinion, and that Americans would be left footing the bill. \u201cThe American taxpayer is now on the hook for potentially billions of dollars in fines and legal costs,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThe president denied the Keystone XL pipeline permit, even though Congress approved it on a bipartisan basis.\u201d But Bill McKibben, the founder of 350.org, which led the protests, predicted TransCanada was unlikely to be successful. \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to get the pipeline built,\u201d he said. \u201cThe idea that some trade agreement should force us to overheat the planet\u2019s atmosphere is, quite simply, insane.\u201d",

          "bodyText": "Canada\u2019s telegenic new prime minister, Justin Trudeau, made a good first impression on the world stage after the surprise Liberal victory swept the former Conservative government from power last October. He won praise for the gender parity of his cabinet \u2013 and for his off-the-cuff explanation: \u201cBecause it\u2019s 2015.\u201d He made headlines for greeting a planeload of Syrians arriving in Canada under his commitment to bringing in 25,000 Syrians by March. And during a hectic tour in November of four international forums \u2013 including the Paris climate meeting and the Apec summit \u2013 Trudeau held his own with his international counterparts. But political observers say that global allies will be closely watching the neophyte Liberal government in 2016 as it starts to put flesh on the bones of its many campaign pledges. \u201cThey are clearly trying to set a different tone from the Conservative government, but pretty soon they\u2019re going to have to get their teeth into some pretty substantive issues,\u201d said David Bercuson, director at the University of Calgary\u2019s Centre for Military, Security and Strategic Studies. Trudeau\u2019s new year to-do list includes a host of key issues with consequences beyond Canada\u2019s borders, from following through on ambitious climate promises to tackling international trade and clean energy deals and national security issues. On defence, that means pulling Canada\u2019s six fighter jets out of the anti-Islamic State coalition while stepping up military training and humanitarian efforts \u2013 a plan yet to be detailed \u2013 replacing its aging fleet of CF-18 fighter jets and expanding its peacekeeping efforts. The decision to end the combat mission against Isis was one of Trudeau\u2019s first policy announcements after his election but it is unlikely to create much tension in the Canada-US relationship, said Andrew Finn, with the Canada Institute at the Washington-based Wilson Center. \u201cCanada is still going to be involved in the intelligence sharing, they\u2019re still going to have their trainers there,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s still a commitment to the fight.\u201d Canada, along with allies like Australia, the UK, Denmark and Norway, is part of the US-led Joint Strike Fighter program to design and develop a new, affordable, cutting-edge fighter jet. In 2010, under the former Conservative government, Canada committed to purchasing 65 of the new jets without holding an open procurement process. That proved controversial, along with the costs of acquiring the new fleet, and the Liberals pledged they would seek a cheaper alternative during the campaign. Bercuson said that the US will be concerned that whichever jet Canada picks to replace its CF-18s, it must meet key capabilities. \u201cWe have a responsibility to our friends in Norad,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the Americans to look north and see a big hole in continental defence is not the best way for us to win friends and influence people in Washington.\u201d On trade, the Liberals have committed to implementing the Canada-European Union agreement (CETA) and consulting on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) deal. Former Canadian diplomat Colin Robertson said Trudeau will be pressured by TPP partners to support the deal but won\u2019t have to tackle it politically until the 12-nation agreement is brought before US lawmakers for a vote next year. \u201cIf you endorse the Canada-Europe deal it\u2019s pretty hard not to endorse the Trans-Pacific Partnership,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd arguably it\u2019s more important to us because it includes the United States and Mexico, which effectively allows us to update Nafta.\u201d Robertson also said that Canada\u2019s partners will keep a close eye on Trudeau\u2019s handling of the country\u2019s finances. The government said it would run up to CAD$10bn annual deficits over three years before balancing the budget in 2019 in order to pay for major infrastructure and sustainable energy projects. It has also pledged to increase funding to First Nations for infrastructure, housing, and education, has opened the door to boosting federal transfers to the provinces, and promised better services to veterans. But low commodity prices, a worsening fiscal outlook and a broken promise that a middle-class tax break would be revenue-neutral is already raising doubts about the final price tag. \u201cOther countries will look at how he handles that side of it \u2013 that\u2019ll be a big test,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cAfter the financial crisis (Canada) preached a bit \u2013 probably with some justification \u2013 to others. They\u2019ll be looking to see if there\u2019s continuity there because that\u2019s important for the money markets.\u201d Trudeau has committed to strengthening Canada\u2019s ties with the US \u2013 which floundered under former prime minister Stephen Harper over the failed Keystone XL pipeline project \u2013 and with Mexico. Trudeau will soon get a chance to pitch his plan for a renewed continental partnership on the environment and clean energy in the yet-to-be scheduled annual North American Leaders\u2019 summit. Trudeau has also been invited to the White House for a state dinner in March, the first Canadian leader to be feted in such a way since 1997 \u2013 Robertson described the two as seeing each other as \u201csimpatico souls\u201d on their policy vision. But despite the honeymoon period, Liberals remain untested in a world where events like the Paris attacks have shown that the unexpected can overturn even the best laid plans and intentions. \u201cNow you start looking to see what they actually do and how they deal with their first crisis, which may well be foreign,\u201d he said. \u201cThat will be the test.\u201d",

          "body": "<p>The photograph of Tima Kurdi\u2019s nephew is perhaps the picture that the western world will remember most from 2015. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/03/refugee-crisis-friends-and-family-fill-in-gaps-behind-harrowing-images\">The image of Alan</a>, a two-year-old Syrian refugee, lying face down on a Turkish beach in early September is what woke the west to the urgency of the Syrian refugee crisis. Tima herself, however, still can\u2019t bring herself to look at it for long: it was she who scrabbled together the money for Alan and his family to make the ill-fated journey that drowned the toddler, his brother and their mother.</p> <p>\u201cI cannot look at that picture,\u201d says Tima. \u201cIt just breaks my heart, the way he was lying down. I don\u2019t know how to describe it. He is desperate. He has no idea what\u2019s around him. He has nobody.\u201d</p> <p>Turkish military policeman Mehmet \u00c7\u0131plak was the first person to find Alan\u2019s body, and his voice still shakes when he remembers what happened next. \u201cI checked for a signal of life, hoping he was still alive,\u201d says \u00c7\u0131plak. \u201cI was so sad. I am a father first. I have a six-year-old son. I empathised, I put him in my son\u2019s place. There was an indefinable pain. Beyond being a military police officer, I behaved as a father.\u201d</p> <p>\u00c7\u0131plak had no idea that both his and Alan\u2019s picture were about to be splashed across hundreds of international newspapers. \u201cWhen the picture was online and then was on international press, my wife, my family, my colleagues called me,\u201d remembers \u00c7\u0131plak. \u201cThey realized my face was in the pictures and they asked me: \u2018How did you carry that burden?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a burden that Tima Kurdi still carries: every day, she partly blames herself for what happened. A Kurdish hair-stylist, she moved to Canada in 1991, saying goodbye to four brothers and sisters in Syria. Twenty-four years later, the Syrian war forced her siblings to flee to Turkey, where refugees cannot work legally. Tima\u2019s income kept all four families afloat, but her brother Abdullah was still living in poverty \u2013 prompting his decision to take Alan, his other son Ghalib and his wife, Rehanna, to Europe. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t enough,\u201d Tima says of her donations. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the guilt that will always follow me.

          "bodyText": "The photograph of Tima Kurdi\u2019s nephew is perhaps the picture that the western world will remember most from 2015. The image of Alan, a two-year-old Syrian refugee, lying face down on a Turkish beach in early September is what woke the west to the urgency of the Syrian refugee crisis. Tima herself, however, still can\u2019t bring herself to look at it for long: it was she who scrabbled together the money for Alan and his family to make the ill-fated journey that drowned the toddler, his brother and their mother. \u201cI cannot look at that picture,\u201d says Tima. \u201cIt just breaks my heart, the way he was lying down. I don\u2019t know how to describe it. He is desperate. He has no idea what\u2019s around him. He has nobody.\u201d Turkish military policeman Mehmet \u00c7\u0131plak was the first person to find Alan\u2019s body, and his voice still shakes when he remembers what happened next. \u201cI checked for a signal of life, hoping he was still alive,\u201d says \u00c7\u0131plak. \u201cI was so sad. I am a father first. I have a six-year-old son. I empathised, I put him in my son\u2019s place. There was an indefinable pain. Beyond being a military police officer, I behaved as a father.\u201d \u00c7\u0131plak had no idea that both his and Alan\u2019s picture were about to be splashed across hundreds of international newspapers. \u201cWhen the picture was online and then was on international press, my wife, my family, my colleagues called me,\u201d remembers \u00c7\u0131plak. \u201cThey realized my face was in the pictures and they asked me: \u2018How did you carry that burden?\u2019\u201d It\u2019s a burden that Tima Kurdi still carries: every day, she partly blames herself for what happened. A Kurdish hair-stylist, she moved to Canada in 1991, saying goodbye to four brothers and sisters in Syria. Twenty-four years later, the Syrian war forced her siblings to flee to Turkey, where refugees cannot work legally. Tima\u2019s income kept all four families afloat, but her brother Abdullah was still living in poverty \u2013 prompting his decision to take Alan, his other son Ghalib and his wife, Rehanna, to Europe. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t enough,\u201d Tima says of her donations. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the guilt that will always follow me. It just breaks my heart. Every day I say: I wish I had sent them more food.\u201d Abdullah, meanwhile, has been taken in by the president of Iraqi Kurdistan, Masoud Barzani, and is in an even worse state. \u201cAbdullah appears normal on the outside,\u201d says Tima. \u201cBut on the inside, he\u2019s been dead for a long time. He needs time.\u201d The family derives some catharsis from the impact the photograph had on policy and public opinion in Canada and abroad.

And in Havana and Washington DC, the flags of the former arch-foes were hoisted once again following the restoration of diplomatic relations.</p> <p>But it was also a year of many more frightening and tragic events. From the ungoverned spaces of northern Nigeria and eastern Syria to the cruel shores of Greece and Turkey, from the streets of Paris to the holiday resorts of Tunisia and Egypt, from the waters of the South China Sea to the icy sea-lanes of the North Atlantic, 2015 was a year of tumult, terror and transition. More than ever, it was a year of living dangerously.</p> <h2>Conflicts and confrontations<br></h2> <p>The year saw the coming of age, in the worst possible sense, of Islamic State (Isis) and those who claim to be inspired or directed by the terrorist group. </p> <p>Isis\u2019s expanding reach brought mass murder to Kuwait, Lebanon, Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Libya, Tunisia and Paris. In the French capital the year began with an attack on a kosher supermarket by a man who had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/11/paris-gunman-amedy-coulibaly-allegiance-isis\">declared allegiance to Isis</a> (the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/14/al-qaida-claims-responsibility-charlie-hebdo-attack-paris\">Charlie Hebdo attacks were claimed by an al-Qaida affiliate</a> in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/yemen\">Yemen</a>), and drew to a close amid the carnage of another, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/14/paris-attacks-bataclan-concert-hall\">even more murderous assault in the French capital.</a> </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"92e18bacafdba1acc57a0678eea7c0bcfe48923e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/92e18bacafdba1acc57a0678eea7c0bcfe48923e/0_295_5184_3112/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tributes at a memorial outside Le Carillon cafe Paris\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tributes, candles and flowers at a memorial outside Le Carillon cafe, one of the sites of the coordinated terrorist attacks in Paris in November.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kenzo Tribouillard/AFP/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile its gross depredations in its self-declared caliphate in northern Syria and Iraq continued largely unchecked despite intensified bombing by a US-led multinational coalition, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/29/observer-view-isis-syria-british-military-action\">reinforced in December by Britain.</a> <br></p> <p>Growing mayhem sparked urgent debate in western capitals about the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/14/france-the-secular-seat-of-europe-to-lose-so-many-to-radical-islam\">radicalisation of young European Muslims</a>, the global spread of jihadi ideology, increased state security and surveillance powers, the need for a settlement of Syria\u2019s civil war, and the desirability or otherwise of expanded military intervention on the ground. </p> <p>Two things, at least, became clear: in the short term, the international community remains badly divided over exactly what to do about Isis\u2019s reign of terror; and in the longer term a way has to be found of defusing the Sunni Muslim revolt that has been building across the Arab world since the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. </p> <p>The year saw a range of sometimes related, similarly dangerous conflicts in Nigeria, where Boko Haram Islamists attacked Muslims and Christians alike; in Libya, where post-Gaddafi chaos deepened; and in Afghanistan, where fears increased of a Taliban and al-Qaida comeback <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/15/obama-uturn-troops-withdrawal-afghanistan-election-issue\">following Nato\u2019s withdrawal.</a><br></p> <p>Tensions rose in the East and South China Seas, where <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/27/us-manoeuvre-in-south-china-sea-leaves-little-wiggle-room-with-china\">China\u2019s maritime expansionism and military build-up </a>encountered strengthening but so far non-violent US resistance. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4e705be198e06d54ebd1ea039199440f15286a14\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e705be198e06d54ebd1ea039199440f15286a14/0_142_2500_1501/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A mass military parade in Pyongyang, North Korea\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A military parade in Pyongyang, North Korea, marking the 70th anniversary of the ruling Workers\u2019 Party in October.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: KNS/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Japan, in particular, expressed concern about Beijing\u2019s ambitions, which include the building of artificial islands and air strips on disputed South China Sea reefs, and stepped up its own defence spending. </p> <p>With presidential elections due in January in Taiwan, which China regards as a breakaway province, and with China rejecting a Philippines bid for international legal arbitration, regional stresses and strains look set to increase in 2016. </p> <p>Elsewhere in east Asia there were signs of <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/trade-trumps-hostility-korea-china-japan-summit-215458459--finance.html\">a mild thaw in relations</a> between Japan and South Korea in the face of the common menace posed by North Korea. Kim Jong-un, Pyongyang\u2019s podgy panjandrum, purged his officials, threatened Seoul with a blitzkrieg, and <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2015/09/15/asia/north-korea-nuclear-program/\">warned the US it could be hit \u201cany time\u201d</a> by his nuclear weapons and missiles.</p> <p>In eastern Ukraine, in contrast, tensions reduced after Russian-backed secessionists reluctantly accepted the Minsk peace accord negotiated by Angela Merkel. </p> <p>In South Sudan, meanwhile, a dreadful civil war entered its third year amid the failure of successive ceasefire deals. Ethnic cleansing, child soldier recruitment and mass rape were among horrors spawned by a conflict that has displaced 2.3 million people, left 4.6 million in need of emergency food aid, and killed tens of thousands. Now, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/oct/28/south-sudan-civil-war-inquiry-details-torture-and-forced-cannibalism\">the UN is warning of a \u201cconcrete risk of famine\u201d</a>. </p> <p>All these conflict zones remain active and potentially volatile as 2016 dawns.</p> <h2>Emergencies and extremists<br></h2> <p>Europe confronted its biggest existential challenge since the darkest days of the cold war as the steady flow of refugees from internecine war, political unrest, economic failure and climate change in the Middle East, south Asia and Africa turned into <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/11/eus-deep-dilemmas-over-refugees-laid-bare-at-malta-summit\">an apparently unstoppable torrent of human misery</a>. </p> <p>By year\u2019s end, Germany alone was close to a figure of 1 million new arrivals in 2015, mostly from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. Having bravely opened Germany\u2019s borders as a matter of humanitarian principle, Merkel was under growing pressure to shut the door as her poll ratings plunged. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f32adb1ec224a1e34d13418ca762c3aba11bd344\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f32adb1ec224a1e34d13418ca762c3aba11bd344/0_37_4512_2709/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Refugees behind a fence at the Hungarian border with Serbia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Refugees behind a fence at the Hungarian border with Serbia in September.

Further afield, fear of Islamist terrorism and ugly anti-Muslim prejudice brought shameful calls in the US, a nation built by immigrants, for an outright ban or forced registration of all Muslims. </p> <p>Driven by increasingly angry, public disagreements and a shambolic official response, the migrant crisis threatened to destabilise or even break apart the EU. Voter support for xenophobic, nationalist and far right parties increased in France, Poland, Denmark, Britain and Germany. This instability looks certain to continue in to 2016, fed by a continuing refugee influx and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/25/observer-editorial-europe-lurches-to-the-right-poland\">rising extremism.</a> </p> <p>In Greece, unchecked migration compounded the extraordinary difficulties arising from the country\u2019s near bankruptcy. For a time in 2015 it seemed Athens, under its new leftwing government, would crash out of the euro, triggering a wider currency and market collapse. <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-08-19/euro-area-agrees-on-bailout-deal-for-greece-eu-commission-says \">A last-minute compromise was found.</a> But the crushing debt burden on southern European states was not removed, only temporarily eased.</p> <p>As for that other emergency \u2013 the one facing the whole world, climate change \u2013 a key country remained out of step. Even as it launched a global solar energy initiative, India insisted it would continue its rapid expansion of coal-fired power stations, placing economic development for its 1.25 billion people ahead of environmental responsibility. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2141a466678a5f9b53199b62672cd25311f1e68f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2141a466678a5f9b53199b62672cd25311f1e68f/0_213_4096_2459/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstrators wear heads of world leaders during the Paris climate summit.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstrators wear heads of world leaders during the Paris climate summit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yoan Valat/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Eighteen months after his election, Narendra Modi, India\u2019s nationalist prime minister, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/09/narendra-modi-the-divisive-manipulator-who-charmed-the-world \">remains a divisive figure</a>. But after his ruling party suffered a stunning election defeat in November in Bihar, India\u2019s third most populous state \u2013 a vote he had called a referendum on his premiership \u2013 it appeared Modi\u2019s popular appeal could be on the wane. </p> <h2>Democrats and dictators</h2> <p>Democratic governance had a mixed year. Canadian voters turned their backs on a decade of Conservative rule, electing Justin Trudeau, age 43, son of the late Pierre, as prime minister. This was despite, or perhaps because of, his unconventional policy platform that included legalising cannabis and ending Canadian military involvement in Syria and Iraq. Speaking at the Commonwealth summit in Malta, the Queen, age 89, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/10/20/us-canada-election-idUSKCN0SD17X20151020\">complained Trudeau made her feel old.</a></p> <p>At the other end of the world, Australia\u2019s loquacious prime minister, Tony Abbott, was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/sep/14/australian-leader-tony-abbott-ousted-by-malcolm-turnbull-after-mps-vote\">ousted in an internal party coup</a>, without the benefit of a national vote. Few tears were shed over his sudden departure, especially not by would-be immigrants held in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/dec/09/offshore-detention-cost-12bn-senate-estimates-asylum-seekers-charter-flights\">offshore asylum camps</a> that have besmirched Australia\u2019s international reputation. </p> <p>In Turkey, two general elections in 2015 finally produced the result ordained by the country\u2019s strongman president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. In the first vote, in June, Erdo\u011fan\u2019s ruling party inadvertently lost its overall majority, due largely to a surge of support for a pro-Kurdish party.</p> <p>Erdo\u011fan responded by tearing up the ceasefire with the Kurdistan Workers party (PKK) and encouraging \u2013 so said his critics \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/01/turks-could-pay-high-price-for-stability-promised-erdogan\">a sense of national insecurity</a>. It seemed to work. Frightened voters were shaken in particular by<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/10/turkey-suicide-bomb-killed-in-ankara\"> the deadliest bomb attack in Turkey\u2019s recent history</a> which Erdo\u011fan condemned as a terrorist act and a \u201cheinous attack on our unity\u201d. His Justice and Development party won back its majority in November.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1f8cd8e954dec34c186d39190c774d904923e62f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f8cd8e954dec34c186d39190c774d904923e62f/0_0_5760_3458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aftermath of the bombing of a peace rally in the Turkish capital, Ankara\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The aftermath of the bombing of a peace rally in the Turkish capital, Ankara, which killed dozens of people and injured many others.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Burhan Ozbilici/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Argentina experienced what observers called <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/27/opinion/argentinas-transformative-election.html\">a transformative election</a>. Victory for Mauricio Macri, mayor of Buenos Aires, brought an end to more than decade of dirigiste and bombastic Peronist rule. </p> <p>In Guatemala, a former comedian, Jimmy Morales, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/26/jimmy-morales-comic-and-self-styled-outsider-wins-guatemala-presidency\">won the presidency</a> on an anti-corruption platform, following his jailed predecessor\u2019s disgrace. Unlike Trudeau in Canada, one of his first acts was to restate his opposition to decriminalising narcotics. </p> <p>Thanks in large part to Pope Francis, who made a ground-breaking visit to Havana in September, 2015 was the year <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/18/us-cuba-relations-one-year-later-progress-report\">Cuba finally came in from the cold</a>. And amid widely-shared relief, Iran\u2019s theocratic leadership at last approved a nuclear deal with the western powers, meaning trade and other sanctions may soon be lifted.</p> <p>The deal was seen as a fillip for the country\u2019s quasi-moderate leader, President Hassan Rouhani. But Iran\u2019s record on human rights and free speech remains dismal, and its hoped-for cooperation on ending the Syrian war <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/middle-east/n-africa/iran\">has yet to materialise in concrete form.</a> </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8a0f2a97c7a5e8b79399d4411597cacc16555596\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a0f2a97c7a5e8b79399d4411597cacc16555596/0_0_4096_2460/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A protester waves a Burundian flag during an anti-government demonstration in Bujumbura.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A protester waves a Burundian flag during an anti-government demonstration in Bujumbura.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dai Kurokawa/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Matters proceeded much less smoothly in Burundi where President Pierre Nkurunziza unwisely insisted on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/24/burundi-pierre-nkurunziza-wins-third-term-disputed-election\">seeking a third consecutive term in office</a>, despite a constitutional prohibition and public opposition. Predictably, his power grab provoked worsening violence and mass flight. </p> <p>In Russia, meanwhile, the rule of Vladimir Putin continued intact despite the damaging impact of western sanctions, imposed after his annexation of Crimea, and spending cuts necessitated by falling oil revenues. Notwithstanding the absence of free speech and open debate, Putin could face trouble in 2016 if the economy continues to contract. The president stepped up his confrontational policy of <a href=\"http://theweek.com/articles/574655/why-russian-air-force-keeps-recklessly-testing-americas-defenses\">sending Russian bombers and submarines to probe western defences</a> in the North Atlantic and Baltic in 2015, part of his vainglorious attempt to re-establish Russia as a global superpower. He also intervened militarily in Syria on the side of that country\u2019s dictator, President Bashar al-Assad. But Putin received a comeuppance in November, when Turkey shot down a Russian warplane it said had violated its airspace. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"67b7d6569ac92a62566bc9aa7948b634a253fb2c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/67b7d6569ac92a62566bc9aa7948b634a253fb2c/0_0_3800_2283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chinese President Xi Jinping, accompanied by Prince Philip, inspects the guard of honour\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chinese President Xi Jinping, accompanied by Prince Philip, inspects the guard of honour during a ceremonial welcome in London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Xinhua/Landov/Barcroft Media</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In China, home of the world\u2019s last great Communist dictatorship, President Xi Jinping tightened his grip on the organs of power and on media and civil society organisations, attempting to compensate for an economic downturn by increasing centralised control. This, too, could spell trouble down the road. David Cameron\u2019s obsequious treatment of Xi during a state visit to the UK <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2015/nov/01/letters-china-xi-jinping-britain-visit\">drew the contempt of human rights campaigners.</a> </p> <p>In the US, the 2016 presidential election drew inexorably closer, with Hillary Clinton emerging as the Democrats\u2019 most likely nominee to replace Barack Obama. On the Republican side, a series of often raucous and unpleasant televised candidates debates showed how far the GOP has drifted to the right. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/08/donald-trump-muslim-ban-republican-party-chaos\">racist</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/22/donald-trump-says-hillary-clinton-was-schlonged-in-2008-loss-to-barack-obama\">misogynistic antics</a> of Donald Trump, a property developer who topped party polls, may have permanently tainted the Republican cause in the eyes of mainstream voters. </p> <p>In New Zealand, finally, nothing much happened of political significance in 2015, although there was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/11/new-zealand-female-mps-mass-walkout-pm-rapists-comment\">a noisy parliamentary bust-up</a> over male attitudes to sexual assault. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/30/one-final-haka-as-new-zealand-bids-emotional-farewell-to-jonah-lomu \">untimely death of Jonah Lomu</a>, one of rugby union\u2019s all-time greats, was widely mourned.

Israel was unhappy, as were Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states \u2013 but most of the rest of the world breathed a deep sigh of relief. The year brought signs of progress \u2013 at long last \u2013 on the global effort to fight climate change, after negotiators from nearly 200 countries signed up to an ambitious deal to limit temperature rise. In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel inspired many across Europe by opening her country\u2019s borders to Middle Eastern refugees, at considerable cost to her personal political position. From Argentina to Myanmar, where Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi led an opposition landslide election victory ending absolute army rule, several countries enjoyed an overdue fresh start. In China, the Communist party finally revoked its oppressive one-child policy. And in Havana and Washington DC, the flags of the former arch-foes were hoisted once again following the restoration of diplomatic relations. But it was also a year of many more frightening and tragic events.

Isis\u2019s expanding reach brought mass murder to Kuwait, Lebanon, Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Libya, Tunisia and Paris. In the French capital the year began with an attack on a kosher supermarket by a man who had declared allegiance to Isis (the Charlie Hebdo attacks were claimed by an al-Qaida affiliate in Yemen), and drew to a close amid the carnage of another, even more murderous assault in the French capital. Meanwhile its gross depredations in its self-declared caliphate in northern Syria and Iraq continued largely unchecked despite intensified bombing by a US-led multinational coalition, reinforced in December by Britain. Growing mayhem sparked urgent debate in western capitals about the radicalisation of young European Muslims, the global spread of jihadi ideology, increased state security and surveillance powers, the need for a settlement of Syria\u2019s civil war, and the desirability or otherwise of expanded military intervention on the ground. Two things, at least, became clear: in the short term, the international community remains badly divided over exactly what to do about Isis\u2019s reign of terror; and in the longer term a way has to be found of defusing the Sunni Muslim revolt that has been building across the Arab world since the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. The year saw a range of sometimes related, similarly dangerous conflicts in Nigeria, where Boko Haram Islamists attacked Muslims and Christians alike; in Libya, where post-Gaddafi chaos deepened; and in Afghanistan, where fears increased of a Taliban and al-Qaida comeback following Nato\u2019s withdrawal. Tensions rose in the East and South China Seas, where China\u2019s maritime expansionism and military build-up encountered strengthening but so far non-violent US resistance. Japan, in particular, expressed concern about Beijing\u2019s ambitions, which include the building of artificial islands and air strips on disputed South China Sea reefs, and stepped up its own defence spending. With presidential elections due in January in Taiwan, which China regards as a breakaway province, and with China rejecting a Philippines bid for international legal arbitration, regional stresses and strains look set to increase in 2016. Elsewhere in east Asia there were signs of a mild thaw in relations between Japan and South Korea in the face of the common menace posed by North Korea. Kim Jong-un, Pyongyang\u2019s podgy panjandrum, purged his officials, threatened Seoul with a blitzkrieg, and warned the US it could be hit \u201cany time\u201d by his nuclear weapons and missiles. In eastern Ukraine, in contrast, tensions reduced after Russian-backed secessionists reluctantly accepted the Minsk peace accord negotiated by Angela Merkel. In South Sudan, meanwhile, a dreadful civil war entered its third year amid the failure of successive ceasefire deals. Ethnic cleansing, child soldier recruitment and mass rape were among horrors spawned by a conflict that has displaced 2.3 million people, left 4.6 million in need of emergency food aid, and killed tens of thousands. Now, the UN is warning of a \u201cconcrete risk of famine\u201d. All these conflict zones remain active and potentially volatile as 2016 dawns. Emergencies and extremists Europe confronted its biggest existential challenge since the darkest days of the cold war as the steady flow of refugees from internecine war, political unrest, economic failure and climate change in the Middle East, south Asia and Africa turned into an apparently unstoppable torrent of human misery. By year\u2019s end, Germany alone was close to a figure of 1 million new arrivals in 2015, mostly from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. Having bravely opened Germany\u2019s borders as a matter of humanitarian principle, Merkel was under growing pressure to shut the door as her poll ratings plunged. Sweden, a traditional haven for asylum seekers, has already done so, while others, notably Hungary, Poland, Croatia and Slovenia, started building frontier walls in a return to the pre-1989 era. Further afield, fear of Islamist terrorism and ugly anti-Muslim prejudice brought shameful calls in the US, a nation built by immigrants, for an outright ban or forced registration of all Muslims. Driven by increasingly angry, public disagreements and a shambolic official response, the migrant crisis threatened to destabilise or even break apart the EU. Voter support for xenophobic, nationalist and far right parties increased in France, Poland, Denmark, Britain and Germany. This instability looks certain to continue in to 2016, fed by a continuing refugee influx and rising extremism. In Greece, unchecked migration compounded the extraordinary difficulties arising from the country\u2019s near bankruptcy. For a time in 2015 it seemed Athens, under its new leftwing government, would crash out of the euro, triggering a wider currency and market collapse. A last-minute compromise was found. But the crushing debt burden on southern European states was not removed, only temporarily eased. As for that other emergency \u2013 the one facing the whole world, climate change \u2013 a key country remained out of step. Even as it launched a global solar energy initiative, India insisted it would continue its rapid expansion of coal-fired power stations, placing economic development for its 1.25 billion people ahead of environmental responsibility. Eighteen months after his election, Narendra Modi, India\u2019s nationalist prime minister, remains a divisive figure. But after his ruling party suffered a stunning election defeat in November in Bihar, India\u2019s third most populous state \u2013 a vote he had called a referendum on his premiership \u2013 it appeared Modi\u2019s popular appeal could be on the wane. Democrats and dictators Democratic governance had a mixed year. Canadian voters turned their backs on a decade of Conservative rule, electing Justin Trudeau, age 43, son of the late Pierre, as prime minister. This was despite, or perhaps because of, his unconventional policy platform that included legalising cannabis and ending Canadian military involvement in Syria and Iraq. Speaking at the Commonwealth summit in Malta, the Queen, age 89, complained Trudeau made her feel old. At the other end of the world, Australia\u2019s loquacious prime minister, Tony Abbott, was ousted in an internal party coup, without the benefit of a national vote. Few tears were shed over his sudden departure, especially not by would-be immigrants held in offshore asylum camps that have besmirched Australia\u2019s international reputation. In Turkey, two general elections in 2015 finally produced the result ordained by the country\u2019s strongman president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. In the first vote, in June, Erdo\u011fan\u2019s ruling party inadvertently lost its overall majority, due largely to a surge of support for a pro-Kurdish party. Erdo\u011fan responded by tearing up the ceasefire with the Kurdistan Workers party (PKK) and encouraging \u2013 so said his critics \u2013 a sense of national insecurity. It seemed to work. Frightened voters were shaken in particular by the deadliest bomb attack in Turkey\u2019s recent history which Erdo\u011fan condemned as a terrorist act and a \u201cheinous attack on our unity\u201d. His Justice and Development party won back its majority in November. Argentina experienced what observers called a transformative election. Victory for Mauricio Macri, mayor of Buenos Aires, brought an end to more than decade of dirigiste and bombastic Peronist rule. In Guatemala, a former comedian, Jimmy Morales, won the presidency on an anti-corruption platform, following his jailed predecessor\u2019s disgrace. Unlike Trudeau in Canada, one of his first acts was to restate his opposition to decriminalising narcotics. Thanks in large part to Pope Francis, who made a ground-breaking visit to Havana in September, 2015 was the year Cuba finally came in from the cold. And amid widely-shared relief, Iran\u2019s theocratic leadership at last approved a nuclear deal with the western powers, meaning trade and other sanctions may soon be lifted. The deal was seen as a fillip for the country\u2019s quasi-moderate leader, President Hassan Rouhani. But Iran\u2019s record on human rights and free speech remains dismal, and its hoped-for cooperation on ending the Syrian war has yet to materialise in concrete form. Matters proceeded much less smoothly in Burundi where President Pierre Nkurunziza unwisely insisted on seeking a third consecutive term in office, despite a constitutional prohibition and public opposition. Predictably, his power grab provoked worsening violence and mass flight. In Russia, meanwhile, the rule of Vladimir Putin continued intact despite the damaging impact of western sanctions, imposed after his annexation of Crimea, and spending cuts necessitated by falling oil revenues. Notwithstanding the absence of free speech and open debate, Putin could face trouble in 2016 if the economy continues to contract. The president stepped up his confrontational policy of sending Russian bombers and submarines to probe western defences in the North Atlantic and Baltic in 2015, part of his vainglorious attempt to re-establish Russia as a global superpower. He also intervened militarily in Syria on the side of that country\u2019s dictator, President Bashar al-Assad. But Putin received a comeuppance in November, when Turkey shot down a Russian warplane it said had violated its airspace. In China, home of the world\u2019s last great Communist dictatorship, President Xi Jinping tightened his grip on the organs of power and on media and civil society organisations, attempting to compensate for an economic downturn by increasing centralised control. This, too, could spell trouble down the road. David Cameron\u2019s obsequious treatment of Xi during a state visit to the UK drew the contempt of human rights campaigners. In the US, the 2016 presidential election drew inexorably closer, with Hillary Clinton emerging as the Democrats\u2019 most likely nominee to replace Barack Obama. On the Republican side, a series of often raucous and unpleasant televised candidates debates showed how far the GOP has drifted to the right. The racist and misogynistic antics of Donald Trump, a property developer who topped party polls, may have permanently tainted the Republican cause in the eyes of mainstream voters. In New Zealand, finally, nothing much happened of political significance in 2015, although there was a noisy parliamentary bust-up over male attitudes to sexual assault. The untimely death of Jonah Lomu, one of rugby union\u2019s all-time greats, was widely mourned. Oh, and the All Blacks won the Rugby World Cup \u2013 again.",

          "body": "<p>A Guatemalan investigative journalist named Luis Solano was in Canada last month to launch a report about a Canadian-owned silver mine in south-east Guatemala. The mine, Escobal, began operating last year and is run by Minera San Rafael (MSR), a subsidiary of the British Columbia-incorporated Tahoe Resources. </p> <p>The 27-page report, titled <a href=\"http://www.miningwatch.ca/news/state-fear-and-terror-deliberately-created-force-tahoe-resources-mine-guatemalan-communities\">Under Siege: Peaceful Resistance to Tahoe Resources and Militarization in Guatemala</a><em>,</em> was commissioned by the International Platform Against Impunity in Central America and MiningWatch Canada, which published it in November. Based on the experience of several years research and interviews with local inhabitants conducted in mid-2015, one of the key allegations is that 1000s of people living in the region have voted against the mine and further expansion plans, with numerous plebiscites and peaceful marches held. </p> <p>According to Solano, the percentages of those voting \u201cNo\u201d to Escobal in municipal plebiscites were 98.86, 98.34, 98.61, 98.68, 98.3 and 98, while the percentages of people who voted \u201cNo\u201d in \u201cgood faith\u201d plebiscites in eight villages in one municipality where authorities prevented an official plebiscite being held were 99.27, 93.44, 99.20, 96.65, 97.33, 98.84, 98.26 and 100. In only one plebiscite did the majority - 53% - vote in the mine\u2019s favour.<br></p> <p>Another key allegation made in the report is that opposition to the mine is being \u201ccriminalized.\u201d Solano states that more than 100 cases of legal charges have been brought against opponents - all \u201cdismissed for lack of evidence or for including false evidence and/or statements\u201d - while some people have been unlawfully detained, leaders\u2019 homes have been raided, and MSR and Guatemala\u2019s Chamber of Commerce have brought legal challenges to stop plebiscites. According to the report, people are being stigmatised, defamed and, in some cases, called \u201cterrorists.\u201d<br></p> <p>One further key allegation is that opposition to the mine is being met with a military response. Solano alleges that an \u201cInter-Institutional Committee Office\u201d installed by the government is considered by local people to be mainly intended to gather military intelligence, and, in 2013, it declared a \u201cmilitary state of siege\u201d when three \u201cmilitary outposts\u201d manned by the Guatemalan army were established - two of which remain to this day. <br></p> <p>In addition, the report alleges that Tahoe has adopted a security strategy to protect Escobal which Solano calls \u201cquasi-military\u201d and of a \u201ccounterinsurgency nature\u201d, giving rise to what he describes as a \u201cquasi-war scenario\u201d in the region. According to the report, security firms that Tahoe has previously or currently contracted have strong military connections. These include International Security and Defense Management (ISDM), hired in 2011 and described by Solano as \u201camongst the most important private military companies in the world and as one with mercenary roots in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars\u201d, and the Grupo Golan, which Solano calls \u201can Israeli private security company founded in 1983 by members of the Israeli Special Armed Forces.\u201d According to a sworn affidavit by Tahoe\u2019s vice-president, Donald Paul Gray, quoted in the report, MSR \u201cterminated\u201d its contract with Grupo Golan in April 2014, and since then it has retained a company called Centurion Security, which Solano connects to a firm founded by \u201cformer British soldiers\u201d, to provide \u201ccomplete facility protection services\u201d to Escobal.<br></p> <p>The consequences of Tahoe\u2019s and the government\u2019s response include, according to Solano, the \u201cmilitarization\u201d of community life, what local people feel is a \u201cstate of terror\u201d, and regular violence. Arguably the most emblematic example of the latter is a civil action, acknowledged in the report, that was brought against Tahoe Resources Inc. in Canada in June 2014 in which six farmers and one student claimed that in April 2013 they were \u201cshot at close range by Tahoe security personnel during a peaceful protest on the public road outside of the gates of the Escobal mine.\u201d According to the civil action, they were shot \u201cusing weapons that included shotguns, pepper spray, buck shot and rubber bullets\u201d, and as a result they claim they suffered \u201cserious injuries including wounds to their backs, faces, feet and legs.\u201d <br></p> <p>Grupo Golan is named in the civil action, but the plaintiffs argue that it was Tahoe that was \u201cvicariously responsible for their conduct.\u201d On 9 November, just the day before Solano\u2019s report was published, a judge in British Columbia\u2019s Supreme Court refused to hear the case and ruled that \u201cGuatemala is clearly the more appropriate forum.\u201d<br></p> <p>What do these companies think of Solano\u2019s allegations? ISDM could not be reached, while Fernando Samayoa, from Alfa Uno, part of the Grupo Golan, declined to comment but told the Guardian that Alfa Uno\u2019s services to MSR ended in April 2014. Ira Gostin, speaking for both Tahoe and MSR, declined to answer questions about the case, stating \u201cWe are currently not granting interviews.\u201d Peter Snell, from Centurion, told the Guardian, \u201c[We] will not comment about current or historic clients as we have a responsibility of confidentiality to our clients.\u201d<br></p> <p>And what about the allegations made in the civil action? Grupo Golan\u2019s Samayoa told the Guardian \u201cwe are not interested in, to respond or comment to any allegations and/or claims related with such unfortunate event.\u201d<br></p> <p>And Tahoe? According to Canada\u2019s CTV news on the day the civil action was filed in 2014, Gostin emailed: \u201cTahoe has reviewed the Notice of Civil Claim and believes it to be without merit and replete with factual errors.\u201d<br></p> <p>This year, though, Gostin told the Guardian \u201cWe do not discuss ongoing legal issues. This case is pending in the Guatemala courts.\u201d Indeed, this process is referred to in Tahoe\u2019s vice-president\u2019s affidavit which states that \u201cGuatemalan prosecuting authorities\u201d have charged MSR\u2019s security manager with \u201ccausing injuries and obstruction of justice\u201d, although the charges \u201cremain unproven\u201d and the \u201cCourt in Guatemala has yet to make a ruling about whether he should stand trial on the charges.\u201d<br></p> <p>\u201c[The prosecutor] is still investigating the April 2013 incident with MSR\u2019s full cooperation,\u201d Gray\u2019s affidavit reads.<br></p> <p>As previous articles of mine in the Guardian have highlighted, Escobal is far from the only Canadian-owned mine alleged to be having, or which has allegedly had, appalling impacts on 1000s of Guatemalans. Others include the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/andes-to-the-amazon/2014/aug/12/guatemala-gold-mine-protester-beaten-burnt-alive\">Marlin gold and silver mine</a> in Guatemala\u2019s far west, run by a subsidiary of Vancouver-based Goldcorp, and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jul/24/central-american-guatemala-biggest-nickel-mine-reopens-amid-violent-clashes\">Fenix nickel mine</a>, now owned by Cyprus-based Solway Investment Group but previously belonging to Toronto-headquartered Hudbay Minerals.<br></p> <p>Indeed, the role of Canadian mining firms is currently drawing increasing alarm and attention across Latin America as a whole. And why shouldn\u2019t it? According to a report to which more than 30 Latin American civil society organisations contributed and was presented to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in April 2014, between 50% and 70% of all mining in Latin America is now done by Canadian firms.<br></p> <p>That report, titled <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/andes-to-the-amazon/2014/may/14/canadian-mining-serious-environmental-harm-iachr\">The Impact of Canadian Mining in Latin America and Canada\u2019s responsibility</a><em>,</em> focused on 22 large-scale projects in nine countries - Marlin among them, but not Escobal or Fenix. It alleged that operations are having serious environmental and social impacts, including destroying glaciers, contaminating water and rivers, cutting down forests, forcibly displacing people, dividing and impoverishing communities, making false promises about economic benefits, endangering people\u2019s health, fraudulently acquiring property and persecuting opponents to the mines.<br></p> <p>That was followed in June 2014 by a session on Canadian mining in Latin America at the Permanent Peoples Tribunal - when Escobal was one of the projects discussed - and then another report on Canadian mining in Latin America presented to the Inter-American Commission in October 2014, written by the Canadian Network on Corporate Accountability. More recently, in August 2015, MiningWatch Canada and the International Civil Liberties Monitoring Group released a report on <a href=\"http://www.miningwatch.ca/publications/national-interest-criminalization-land-and-environment-defenders-americas\">Canadian mining in Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, Peru and Canada</a> itself which, once again, highlighted Escobal. <br></p> <p>All of the above make serious allegations of human rights violations and environmental abuses involving Canadian mining, and claim that Canada\u2019s government has played a key role in supporting such operations. This allegedly includes providing financing through \u201ctied aid\u201d, among other means, as well as contributing to changes in mining laws favourable to Canadian companies, stopping people affected by mining from seeking legal redress, ignoring complaints, exploiting investment treaties and trade deals, and implementing a \u201cmining diplomacy\u201d in which embassies and diplomats provide explicit support for Canadian companies.<br></p> <p>MiningWatch Canada\u2019s Jen Moore says that, in Escobal\u2019s case, both Tahoe and Guatemala\u2019s government have received the \u201ctacit support\u201d of the Canadian embassy too. Moore told the Guardian that just two days after the alleged shooting of protestors by security guards at Escobal and three days before a \u201cstate of siege\u201d was declared on surrounding communities, the embassy participated in a public ceremony to celebrate the royalty payments Tahoe would pay to the Guatemalan government.<br></p> <p>\u201c[It] publicly demonstrated support for the company at the height of plebiscites, protests and repression in April 2013,\u201d Moore says.<br></p> <p>Given the alleged role of the Canadian state in much of this, the August 2015 report and the two reports presented to the Inter-American Commission in 2014 made a series of hard-hitting recommendations to Canada. These included: 1) stopping \u201coverseas development aid and diplomatic services toward the promotion of large-scale mineral extraction overseas\u201d; 2) abstaining from \u201cproviding any kind of government support\u201d aimed at making legal systems in Latin American countries more flexible in order to promote mining investments to the detriment of human rights; and 3) changing Canadian laws to \u201chold companies based or registered in Canada to account for individual and collective Indigenous and human rights violations committed in another country.\u201d <br></p> <p>Of course, Canada now has a new prime minister, Justin Trudeau, who campaigned on a slogan of \u201cReal Change\u201d, promises to protect the environment, fight climate change and support \u201cthe world\u2019s most poor and vulnerable countries\u201d in doing so, and is heralding a \u201cnew era in Canadian international engagement.\u201d In addition, his official campaign \u201cplatform\u201d committed to support \u201cinnovation and the use of clean technologies\u201d in the mining sector, while back in 2010 he voted in favour of a defeated bill, C-300, intended to \u201cpromote environmental best practices and to ensure the protection and promotion of international human rights standards in respect of the mining, oil or gas activities of Canadian corporations in developing countries.\u201d<br></p> <p>Trudeau\u2019s party, the Liberals, issued a statement to the media earlier this year supporting that bill. Will his government move to resurrect it - or, even better, significantly improve it? And will his government heed any of the recommendations made in the reports cited above specifically regarding Canadian mining in Latin America?<br></p> <p>As for Guatemala and Escobal, Solano told the Guardian he hopes that Canada, mining companies and interested members of the public understand what is happening around the mine, and they don\u2019t just listen \u201cto the mining company or the economic groups working for it doing lobbying and communications work.\u201d<br></p> <p>\u201cThey portray it as a development project, when the communities say the opposite,\u201d Solano says. \u201cThey should recognise that there have been community consultations in which the majority have said that they don\u2019t want the mine. That local communities have a position should be acknowledged, and their decision respected.\u201d <br></p> <p>A Guardian enquiry regarding MiningWatch Canada\u2019s Jen Moore\u2019s allegation about Canada\u2019s embassy in Guatemala providing \u201ctacit support\u201d to Tahoe was made to the embassy. It was forwarded to Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada, which said it would respond but did not do so.<br></p> <p>Justin Trudeau\u2019s office did not respond to requests for comment.<br></p>",

          "bodyText": "A Guatemalan investigative journalist named Luis Solano was in Canada last month to launch a report about a Canadian-owned silver mine in south-east Guatemala. The mine, Escobal, began operating last year and is run by Minera San Rafael (MSR), a subsidiary of the British Columbia-incorporated Tahoe Resources. The 27-page report, titled Under Siege: Peaceful Resistance to Tahoe Resources and Militarization in Guatemala, was commissioned by the International Platform Against Impunity in Central America and MiningWatch Canada, which published it in November. Based on the experience of several years research and interviews with local inhabitants conducted in mid-2015, one of the key allegations is that 1000s of people living in the region have voted against the mine and further expansion plans, with numerous plebiscites and peaceful marches held. According to Solano, the percentages of those voting \u201cNo\u201d to Escobal in municipal plebiscites were 98.86, 98.34, 98.61, 98.68, 98.3 and 98, while the percentages of people who voted \u201cNo\u201d in \u201cgood faith\u201d plebiscites in eight villages in one municipality where authorities prevented an official plebiscite being held were 99.27, 93.44, 99.20, 96.65, 97.33, 98.84, 98.26 and 100. In only one plebiscite did the majority - 53% - vote in the mine\u2019s favour. Another key allegation made in the report is that opposition to the mine is being \u201ccriminalized.\u201d Solano states that more than 100 cases of legal charges have been brought against opponents - all \u201cdismissed for lack of evidence or for including false evidence and/or statements\u201d - while some people have been unlawfully detained, leaders\u2019 homes have been raided, and MSR and Guatemala\u2019s Chamber of Commerce have brought legal challenges to stop plebiscites. According to the report, people are being stigmatised, defamed and, in some cases, called \u201cterrorists.\u201d One further key allegation is that opposition to the mine is being met with a military response. Solano alleges that an \u201cInter-Institutional Committee Office\u201d installed by the government is considered by local people to be mainly intended to gather military intelligence, and, in 2013, it declared a \u201cmilitary state of siege\u201d when three \u201cmilitary outposts\u201d manned by the Guatemalan army were established - two of which remain to this day. In addition, the report alleges that Tahoe has adopted a security strategy to protect Escobal which Solano calls \u201cquasi-military\u201d and of a \u201ccounterinsurgency nature\u201d, giving rise to what he describes as a \u201cquasi-war scenario\u201d in the region. According to the report, security firms that Tahoe has previously or currently contracted have strong military connections. These include International Security and Defense Management (ISDM), hired in 2011 and described by Solano as \u201camongst the most important private military companies in the world and as one with mercenary roots in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars\u201d, and the Grupo Golan, which Solano calls \u201can Israeli private security company founded in 1983 by members of the Israeli Special Armed Forces.\u201d According to a sworn affidavit by Tahoe\u2019s vice-president, Donald Paul Gray, quoted in the report, MSR \u201cterminated\u201d its contract with Grupo Golan in April 2014, and since then it has retained a company called Centurion Security, which Solano connects to a firm founded by \u201cformer British soldiers\u201d, to provide \u201ccomplete facility protection services\u201d to Escobal. The consequences of Tahoe\u2019s and the government\u2019s response include, according to Solano, the \u201cmilitarization\u201d of community life, what local people feel is a \u201cstate of terror\u201d, and regular violence. Arguably the most emblematic example of the latter is a civil action, acknowledged in the report, that was brought against Tahoe Resources Inc. in Canada in June 2014 in which six farmers and one student claimed that in April 2013 they were \u201cshot at close range by Tahoe security personnel during a peaceful protest on the public road outside of the gates of the Escobal mine.\u201d According to the civil action, they were shot \u201cusing weapons that included shotguns, pepper spray, buck shot and rubber bullets\u201d, and as a result they claim they suffered \u201cserious injuries including wounds to their backs, faces, feet and legs.\u201d Grupo Golan is named in the civil action, but the plaintiffs argue that it was Tahoe that was \u201cvicariously responsible for their conduct.\u201d On 9 November, just the day before Solano\u2019s report was published, a judge in British Columbia\u2019s Supreme Court refused to hear the case and ruled that \u201cGuatemala is clearly the more appropriate forum.\u201d What do these companies think of Solano\u2019s allegations? ISDM could not be reached, while Fernando Samayoa, from Alfa Uno, part of the Grupo Golan, declined to comment but told the Guardian that Alfa Uno\u2019s services to MSR ended in April 2014. Ira Gostin, speaking for both Tahoe and MSR, declined to answer questions about the case, stating \u201cWe are currently not granting interviews.\u201d Peter Snell, from Centurion, told the Guardian, \u201c[We] will not comment about current or historic clients as we have a responsibility of confidentiality to our clients.\u201d And what about the allegations made in the civil action? Grupo Golan\u2019s Samayoa told the Guardian \u201cwe are not interested in, to respond or comment to any allegations and/or claims related with such unfortunate event.\u201d And Tahoe? According to Canada\u2019s CTV news on the day the civil action was filed in 2014, Gostin emailed: \u201cTahoe has reviewed the Notice of Civil Claim and believes it to be without merit and replete with factual errors.\u201d This year, though, Gostin told the Guardian \u201cWe do not discuss ongoing legal issues. This case is pending in the Guatemala courts.\u201d Indeed, this process is referred to in Tahoe\u2019s vice-president\u2019s affidavit which states that \u201cGuatemalan prosecuting authorities\u201d have charged MSR\u2019s security manager with \u201ccausing injuries and obstruction of justice\u201d, although the charges \u201cremain unproven\u201d and the \u201cCourt in Guatemala has yet to make a ruling about whether he should stand trial on the charges.\u201d \u201c[The prosecutor] is still investigating the April 2013 incident with MSR\u2019s full cooperation,\u201d Gray\u2019s affidavit reads. As previous articles of mine in the Guardian have highlighted, Escobal is far from the only Canadian-owned mine alleged to be having, or which has allegedly had, appalling impacts on 1000s of Guatemalans. Others include the Marlin gold and silver mine in Guatemala\u2019s far west, run by a subsidiary of Vancouver-based Goldcorp, and the Fenix nickel mine, now owned by Cyprus-based Solway Investment Group but previously belonging to Toronto-headquartered Hudbay Minerals. Indeed, the role of Canadian mining firms is currently drawing increasing alarm and attention across Latin America as a whole. And why shouldn\u2019t it? According to a report to which more than 30 Latin American civil society organisations contributed and was presented to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in April 2014, between 50% and 70% of all mining in Latin America is now done by Canadian firms. That report, titled The Impact of Canadian Mining in Latin America and Canada\u2019s responsibility, focused on 22 large-scale projects in nine countries - Marlin among them, but not Escobal or Fenix. It alleged that operations are having serious environmental and social impacts, including destroying glaciers, contaminating water and rivers, cutting down forests, forcibly displacing people, dividing and impoverishing communities, making false promises about economic benefits, endangering people\u2019s health, fraudulently acquiring property and persecuting opponents to the mines. That was followed in June 2014 by a session on Canadian mining in Latin America at the Permanent Peoples Tribunal - when Escobal was one of the projects discussed - and then another report on Canadian mining in Latin America presented to the Inter-American Commission in October 2014, written by the Canadian Network on Corporate Accountability. More recently, in August 2015, MiningWatch Canada and the International Civil Liberties Monitoring Group released a report on Canadian mining in Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, Peru and Canada itself which, once again, highlighted Escobal. All of the above make serious allegations of human rights violations and environmental abuses involving Canadian mining, and claim that Canada\u2019s government has played a key role in supporting such operations. This allegedly includes providing financing through \u201ctied aid\u201d, among other means, as well as contributing to changes in mining laws favourable to Canadian companies, stopping people affected by mining from seeking legal redress, ignoring complaints, exploiting investment treaties and trade deals, and implementing a \u201cmining diplomacy\u201d in which embassies and diplomats provide explicit support for Canadian companies. MiningWatch Canada\u2019s Jen Moore says that, in Escobal\u2019s case, both Tahoe and Guatemala\u2019s government have received the \u201ctacit support\u201d of the Canadian embassy too. Moore told the Guardian that just two days after the alleged shooting of protestors by security guards at Escobal and three days before a \u201cstate of siege\u201d was declared on surrounding communities, the embassy participated in a public ceremony to celebrate the royalty payments Tahoe would pay to the Guatemalan government. \u201c[It] publicly demonstrated support for the company at the height of plebiscites, protests and repression in April 2013,\u201d Moore says. Given the alleged role of the Canadian state in much of this, the August 2015 report and the two reports presented to the Inter-American Commission in 2014 made a series of hard-hitting recommendations to Canada. These included: 1) stopping \u201coverseas development aid and diplomatic services toward the promotion of large-scale mineral extraction overseas\u201d; 2) abstaining from \u201cproviding any kind of government support\u201d aimed at making legal systems in Latin American countries more flexible in order to promote mining investments to the detriment of human rights; and 3) changing Canadian laws to \u201chold companies based or registered in Canada to account for individual and collective Indigenous and human rights violations committed in another country.\u201d Of course, Canada now has a new prime minister, Justin Trudeau, who campaigned on a slogan of \u201cReal Change\u201d, promises to protect the environment, fight climate change and support \u201cthe world\u2019s most poor and vulnerable countries\u201d in doing so, and is heralding a \u201cnew era in Canadian international engagement.\u201d In addition, his official campaign \u201cplatform\u201d committed to support \u201cinnovation and the use of clean technologies\u201d in the mining sector, while back in 2010 he voted in favour of a defeated bill, C-300, intended to \u201cpromote environmental best practices and to ensure the protection and promotion of international human rights standards in respect of the mining, oil or gas activities of Canadian corporations in developing countries.\u201d Trudeau\u2019s party, the Liberals, issued a statement to the media earlier this year supporting that bill. Will his government move to resurrect it - or, even better, significantly improve it? And will his government heed any of the recommendations made in the reports cited above specifically regarding Canadian mining in Latin America? As for Guatemala and Escobal, Solano told the Guardian he hopes that Canada, mining companies and interested members of the public understand what is happening around the mine, and they don\u2019t just listen \u201cto the mining company or the economic groups working for it doing lobbying and communications work.\u201d \u201cThey portray it as a development project, when the communities say the opposite,\u201d Solano says. \u201cThey should recognise that there have been community consultations in which the majority have said that they don\u2019t want the mine. That local communities have a position should be acknowledged, and their decision respected.\u201d A Guardian enquiry regarding MiningWatch Canada\u2019s Jen Moore\u2019s allegation about Canada\u2019s embassy in Guatemala providing \u201ctacit support\u201d to Tahoe was made to the embassy. It was forwarded to Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada, which said it would respond but did not do so. Justin Trudeau\u2019s office did not respond to requests for comment.",

          "bodyText": "The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, announced on 8 December the launch of a national inquiry into the approximately 1,200 documented cases of indigenous women and girls who have gone missing or been murdered over three decades. The inquiry is a state-led response to the alarming rate of gender violence against indigenous communities across the country \u2013 a crisis that has resulted in international scrutiny of Canada\u2019s failure to uphold the human and political rights of indigenous peoples. The announcement was received with mixed emotions. There was applause from some quarters, including members of parliament and leaders from Canada\u2019s largest aboriginal organisation, the Assembly of First Nations, who praised Trudeau for his move towards \u201ca total renewal of the country\u2019s relationship with its aboriginal population.\u201d Among indigenous families and advocates there was an understandable sense of relief and anticipation that the authorities will finally be forced to act on unsolved cases, potentially put an end to the epidemic of violence, and raise awareness about the deep-seated racism that is woven into the fabric of Canadian society. Affected families, survivors and community groups have been pushing for government action on this crisis for decades, but authorities have so far failed to respond in any meaningful way. Others have raised serious concerns about Canada\u2019s ability to deliver justice to indigenous communities at all. If you step back and look at the bigger picture, this is what becomes visible: the call for a national inquiry exists against the backdrop of Canada\u2019s ugly and violent colonial history. It is easy to link Canada\u2019s failure to acknowledge and engage with this injustice to its last prime minister, Stephen Harper, who repeatedly refused to support an inquiry throughout his nine-year tenure and infamously stated, \u201cUm, it\u2019s not really high on our radar, to be honest.\u201d Harper, though, is only one in a long line of colonial leaders who have actively participated in, and benefited from, the widespread normalisation of violence against indigenous peoples. In fact this story of violence, erasure and complicity dates back to before Canada became Canada. The socio-political realities that make it possible for indigenous women, girls and two-spirit people (who are almost always left out of reports), to be murdered and disappeared in Canada originates in the colonial violence that enabled the creation of the settler state and the expansion of capitalism. Canada could not have been built without it. Colonial acquisition of lands was enacted through targeted gender violence to destroy indigenous peoples\u2019 connection to their territory by attacking those at the heart of that connection: indigenous women. It also served to debase their power and autonomy, fragment societies and curtail indigenous nations\u2019 ability to create life. The contemporary inheritance of this colonial history is reflected in the conditions of systemic vulnerability in which all indigenous people have to live, but are experienced most acutely by women, girls and two-spirit people. The systems of extractive industry, education, healthcare, child welfare, social services and the prison system are all fraught with racism. This reality makes advocating for change on any single front extremely challenging. The state and criminal justice system have completely and utterly failed to respond to these murders and disappearances. This, along with active victim-blaming, has created a culture of impunity for men to rape and murder at will. State-sanctioned safety and protection for indigenous peoples is an illusion at best. But this is not only a matter of failures in police protection: across Canada, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and local law enforcement agencies are active perpetrators of racism and violence against indigenous nations, with particular brutality being shown towards indigenous women, girls and two-spirit people. The criminal justice system and its officers are central to the problem. So how can the Canadian state be held accountable for its complicity in colonial gender violence \u2013 both past and present \u2013 when it is the driving force behind this inquiry? It is crucial that we demand an answer to this question. The indigenous affairs minister, Carolyn Bennett, has said: \u201cThe end goal of the inquiry is to find concrete action that will be able to stop this national tragedy.\u201d If there is to be any hope of this goal being met, the inquiry must be held to account and made to confront the deepest root causes of the crisis. Anything short of this is an affront, will add further injury to indigenous peoples, and is a denial of state culpability. The inquiry must amount to more than just another list of unimplemented recommendations. And we must continue to invoke a sense of social and political history so we are honest about where this violence comes from and don\u2019t lose sight of what is at stake. Let\u2019s also be clear that the national inquiry is just one strategy in this fight for justice that has been led by those who have already lost so much and still have everything to lose: individual survivors, families of the missing and murdered, and those who remain targets of colonial gender violence. These efforts extend to a greater movement for decolonisation and freedom that is being led by indigenous peoples across Turtle Island; a movement that promotes large-scale land restitution, indigenous youth leadership, community-led initiatives to fight ongoing dispossession and trauma, artistic and creative interventions, and the revitalisation of indigenous governance systems. Regardless of this inquiry, indigenous nations will continue to take action to protect life and secure justice \u2013 with or without the support of the Canadian state.",

          "bodyText": "Australia has signed a Paris declaration calling for new clear rules for international carbon trading in a signal the Coalition\u2019s six-year carbon pricing policy veto could be softening as it prepares to review its climate policy in 2017. Foreign minister Julie Bishop, who signed the declaration in Paris, said it was in Australia\u2019s interests to recognise the role an international carbon market might play in reducing emissions after 2020. \u201cIt\u2019s just a declaration, it\u2019s not legally binding,\u201d she said after a speech to an event organised by Australia\u2019s Carbon Market Institute. \u201cIt\u2019s signalling our commitment to working with others about rules for a carbon market post 2020. The detail is for each country to include in their domestic policies, and this is something Australia will consider in due course. \u201cIt is a declaration that recognises the role a carbon market might play after 2020 and we thought it would be in our national interest to sign up to it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are engaging closely with business as we work towards developing and reviewing our domestic climate policies in 2017 and we deeply appreciate the private sector\u2019s interest in accessing international [carbon] units and recognise international carbon markets are also a key part of the global effort to reduce emissions. Carbon markets can provide flexibility for countries and companies to use genuine and verified international units to help meet their commitments.\u201d The declaration, pushed by New Zealand and set to be announced at the end of the Paris meeting, calls for countries to work on transparent rules for carbon trading after 2020 so that they have the choice to enter into bilateral or multilateral carbon trading arrangements. The Coalition has said it will review its Direct Action climate policy in 2017, including the so-called safeguards mechanism \u2013 which could at that time become a baseline and credit emissions trading scheme \u2013 and also whether businesses will be able to buy offshore carbon permits. The quality of international carbon markets has been of concern to the Coalition in the past. Tony Abbott once described buying international permits as being like sending \u201cmoney \u2026 offshore into dodgy carbon farms in Equatorial Guinea and Kazakhstan\u201d. Australia\u2019s opposition to allowing businesses to buy offshore permits began to soften towards the end of Abbott\u2019s prime ministership, and is now considered almost inevitable after 2017. Bishop said the declaration was not about domestic climate policy, but companies only need offshore credits if they have a domestic liability. At the moment the \u201cbaselines\u201d or benchmarks set for emissions from the 140 businesses covered by the safeguards mechanism are set to stop wild increases in emissions, with no business ever likely to exceed them. But the 2017 review will consider whether they should be tightened to make sure policies can achieve the 2030 emissions reduction target Australia has pledged in Paris; to allow businesses who exceed their baselines to buy emission reduction credits from those who have managed to do better; and whether they should be able to source permits offshore. The review could also consider other versions of carbon pricing. Environment minister Greg Hunt has said the \u201csafeguards mechanism\u201d is slated to deliver 200m tonnes of greenhouse gas abatement by 2030 \u2013 something that would require major change. There has been an overwhelming consensus from business groups in Paris that a carbon price would be the most efficient mechanism to drive deep emission reductions. On the first day of the talks the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and six heads of state launched the carbon pricing leadership coalition, which called on all countries to start pricing carbon pollution. The coalition includes more than 90 businesses and non government organisations. IMF managing director Christine Lagarde said \u201cthe right carbon price\u201d had to be at the centre of reducing emissions and \u201cgiven the slump in energy prices, there has never been a better time to transition to smart, credible and effective carbon pricing\u201d. \u201cPolicy makers need to price it right, tax it smart and do it now,\u201d she said, The call was backed by Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau, Mexican president Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, German chancellor Angela Merkel, Chilean president Michelle Bachelet Jeria, and Ethiopian prime minister Hailemariam Desalegn. World Bank group president Jim Yong Kim said it was important to get \u201cmomentum\u201d behind carbon pricing. Labor\u2019s environment minister Mark Butler told the same Carbon Markets Institute event Labor remained convinced that a cap and trade scheme was the most effective policy, but indicated Labor might reconsider \u2013 in the interests of business certainty \u2013 if the Coalition won the next election and established its safeguards mechanism as a working baseline and credit scheme.

          "bodyText": "Canada\u2019s government has launched a long-awaited national inquiry into the murder or disappearance of hundreds of indigenous women, as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised a \u201ctotal renewal\u201d of the country\u2019s relationship with its aboriginal population. Speaking to an Assembly of First Nations (AFN) special chiefs gathering in Gatineau, Qu\u00e9bec, the Liberal leader announced that his government had begun the process to create the inquiry into the nearly 1,200 indigenous women and girls who have been murdered or who have gone missing in Canada over the past three decades. Activists, aboriginal leadership and many victims\u2019 families have been calling for a national inquiry for more than five years \u2013 a move which was resisted by Trudeau\u2019s conservative predecessor, Stephen Harper. \u201cThe victims deserve justice, their families an opportunity to heal and to be heard,\u201d said Trudeau. \u201cWe must work together to put an end to this ongoing tragedy.\u201d Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould said that over the next two months the government will consult victims\u2019 families and Aboriginal leaders to gather their views on the design, scope and parameters of the full inquiry, expected to begin sometime next spring. \u201cNo inquiry can undo what happened nor can it restore what was lost, but it can help us find a way forward,\u201d she said. Claudette Commanda, an Algonquin First Nations member and activist who was invited to Tuesday\u2019s announcement, called it a \u201chistorical event\u201d. \u201cIt is time to hear their voices, it is time for justice,\u201d she said. The first phase will also include an online component with background information, a survey and discussion guide accessible to all Canadians. Indigenous women make up just 4% of Canada\u2019s female population but 16% of all women murdered in the country. First Nations, Inuit and Metis women are three times more likely to report experiencing violence. Indigenous affairs minister Carolyn Bennett said the national inquiry will \u201ctake as long as it takes to get it right\u201d and that no official budget has yet been set. The Liberals had pledged $40m over two years in their campaign platform for the project. Bennett said the end goal of the inquiry \u201cis to be able to find concrete action that will be able to stop this national tragedy\u201d. But Mag Cywink, whose sister Sonya was killed in 1994, said she wanted to see the government take action. \u201cAn inquiry can never bring my sister back. I just don\u2019t want this to happen to my nieces, to my grandchildren and great-grandchildren,\u201d she said. Cywink also wants all levels of government to look at past inquiries \u2013 the 1996, 4,000-page Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, the 2012 British Columbia Missing Women Commission of Inquiry, the recent Truth and Reconciliation report, and work by grassroots organizations \u2013 and to begin implementing the hundreds or recommendations already put forward but never applied. \u201cA lot of the homework has already been done, a lot of the answers are out there, a lot of the questions have been answered about what\u2019s wrong and what\u2019s causing these kinds of problems,\u201d she said. Trudeau, whose landslide victory in October was helped in part by a record number of First Nations voters, promised earlier on Tuesday to reset the country\u2019s relationship with Canada\u2019s 1.4 million indigenous peoples. Speaking to an Assembly of First Nations (AFN) special chiefs gathering in Gatineau, Qu\u00e9bec, the Liberal leader said his government would work to develop a new kind of relationship: \u201cOne that understands that constitutionally guaranteed rights are not an inconvenience but a sacred obligation, one based on recognition of rights, respect, cooperation and partnership.\u201d Trudeau has made big promises on the Aboriginal file on everything from water and housing to education, funding and infrastructure \u2013 pledges that, if implemented, will help address issues like rampant poverty and homelessness that make aboriginal women more vulnerable to deadly violence.

Khawla Qaraq\u2019e is director of the Psycho Social Counselling Centre for Women based in Palestine. </p> <p><strong>KQ</strong> Women in Palestine are more educated than men. The majority of the university students are girls. But after they graduated more than 60% of them are unemployed. </p> <p><strong>LF</strong> For many women getting into the workplace is just the first of many steps. According to UN Women\u2019s flagship report published in April, globally women earn an average 24% less than men, work more hours, and have less chance of receiving a pension in later life. </p> <p><strong>KQ</strong> The owners of business, they find it easier for them to employ men than women, because women need to be pregnant and she will ask for vacation, and she all the time worry about her children. So it\u2019s easier for them to employ men. </p> <p><strong> GR</strong> My name is Gila Rosenberg, I\u2019m the project manager of the Jung Lesbian Centre in Hamburg, Germany. Yeah, I think in Germany we have a totally different situation \u2013 it\u2019s probably quite similar to the UK. Women don\u2019t get paid the same as men. So women in higher positions have to work probably double as hard as men have to. They\u2019re not taken seriously in their leadership positions. </p> <p><strong> SI</strong> I\u2019m Sarah Iqbal, I\u2019m the programme manager of the World Bank Group\u2019s Women in Business and the Law Project. And what we do is really measure the legal environment for women in 173 countries. In high-income economies it may be the situation around maternity, paternity and parental leave, and are there childcare options for women?</p> <p> If women can\u2019t have a good infrastructure for the responsibilities they face in the home, if there\u2019s no place for them to leave their children, then it may be more difficult for them to work or have the same opportunities at work as men. But in lower-income economies, in certain parts of the world, it may well be that there are different restrictions in place. </p> <p> In some countries, actually, things like sexual harassment and domestic violence actually have a large impact on women\u2019s ability to work. In other countries where domestic violence is particularly prevalent, we see women dropping out of the workforce or impingement in their productivity because they\u2019ll take days off when they suffer from violence. And there are not a lot of resources that they can turn to to deal with that. </p> <p><strong> LF</strong> Yannick Glemarec is the deputy executive director for policy and programme at UN Women, and has identified the three main barriers he sees to women reaching leadership positions. </p> <p><strong> YG</strong> So, one is the gender gap in access to positive assets. Another one is discriminatory regulation; and the other one is the social barriers. </p> <p><strong>LF</strong> In Sierra Leone, Isha Johansen overcame all obstacles to get to the top in a very male-dominated profession. We caught up with her earlier this month when she was in London for the Trust Women conference. </p> <p> So obviously we hear a lot about how it\u2019s difficult for women to get into business and politics and everything else, but football, a whole other thing. How did that happen? </p> <p><strong> IJ</strong> Football has always been in my blood, my DNA, with my father being the chairman of a very big, established football club. It all started with the humanitarian project FC Johansen, and it was just a group of young kids, you know, eight-, nine-, 11-year-old kids after the civil war; displaced kids, homeless, really not doing anything. So I approached them and I offered that if they could get back into school then I would help them with the football and with a bit of money as well. And it worked. </p> <p> It became a very personal and maternal thing for me because these were kids who, some of them, had lost their parents and had no direction, and they were far too young. So one thing led to another and they would do their small, mini-community leagues. And then one day I had this crazy idea that I would take them out of the country for an international tournament in Sweden. And everybody thought I was crazy \u2013 and I probably was at the time. And it\u2019s just one wonderful inspirational story after the other with going to Sweden. They were silver medallists, and invitations started to pour in. Real Madrid invited us to play their youth side. Before you knew what was happening, we were in Las Vegas for the Mayor\u2019s Cup. </p> <p><strong>LF</strong> The success of FC Johansen gave Isha the kudos to go for the job at the FA. But being in a position of leadership in such a male-dominated profession brings its own challenges. </p> <p><strong> IJ</strong> It\u2019s just the fear of being bullied, fear of sexism. The knowledge, not knowledge but that whole thing about \u2013 football is for men, how dare you? I\u2019ve been told, \u201cHow dare you?\u201d several times, \u201cWhat do you know?\u201d Not every young girl is up for that, to be told that several times over. And so I think it\u2019s so important that women like myself are out there, even more, speaking about the challenges, that, yes, there will be challenges but you can overcome these challenges if you are committed enough. </p> <p><strong>LF</strong> Although the past 20 years has seen an increase in the number of women holding senior and middle management positions, it will be more than 100 years before gender parity is achieved at top-level positions. And today, just 5% of women are CEOs in the world\u2019s largest corporations. So how can the private sector help shift these barriers? Sarah Iqbal from the World Bank again. </p> <p><strong> SI</strong> One is actually to concentrate on the issue, to discuss it, to talk about it, and to build a pipeline for women to get into leadership roles. In general, women tend to have different styles than men \u2013and it\u2019s not that one is better or worse, but rather that one is accounted for and the other is not. So, for example, women may not push their way forward in the workforce in the same way as men. And I think what the private sector can do is really account for that, really set up programmes that increase gender diversity in the workforce. </p> <p><strong>LF</strong> Felicite Rwemalika is from Rwanda, and is a CEO and founder of the Organisation of Women in Sports, whose main objective is empowering women through football. She recalls her path to a position of leadership. </p> <p><strong> FR</strong> What I can say that women have sometimes the potential and they don\u2019t have the chance to express it out. My time came when my husband left me and went to liberate Rwanda. As a nurse, you cannot look after the four children and take them to school and look after you. So I set up a restaurant. I had a restaurant, I could work in the hospital in the morning, they even got the restaurant. So within those four years, this is when I realised I had the potential of being an entrepreneur. I had the potential of speaking out because of what I went through. </p> <p>So as time went on, I realised I could do business, I could speak out, I could try to see people changing their minds. I think it took me about 10 years to be accepted in the National Football Federation whereby I\u2019m the president of the Women\u2019s Football Commission, which didn\u2019t exist before. And I\u2019m on the board of the International Olympic Committee. And I won an award as an Ashoka fellow. So all this is just because I had a new idea of empowering women through sports, to expel the cultural and social beliefs that hinders or limits women\u2019s participation into the country\u2019s development. </p> <p><strong>LF</strong> Let\u2019s go back to Sarah Iqbal from the World Bank. </p> <p><strong> SI</strong> You see a lot of girls predominantly working in sectors or moving towards sectors where women predominate. So, for example, on the healthcare and education fields, which are both great, but the question is \u2013 girls should be able to work in any field that they want to whether it\u2019s a stem field, whether it\u2019s healthcare, education, whether it\u2019s entrepreneurship. Education is a key building block in determining what girls\u2019 aspirations are for their future lives. We\u2019ve seen actually really interesting models of where the private sector works with universities, works with secondary and tertiary education to actually increase the pipeline for girls and women in certain sectors. </p> <p><strong>LF</strong> Habiba Mohamed is the team leader at the Centre for Girls\u2019 Education in Nigeria. </p> <p><strong> HM</strong> I think the first step is for the government of Nigeria to be able to support the public schools in a way that the teachers are trained, the quality of the education in the school is very good, so that when these girls graduate from secondary school they are able to get the certificates that will qualify them to move to higher institutions. Like our first cohort of girls when they graduated I think it were \u2026 We had very few of them that were able to meet the criteria of moving to higher institutions. We need not only the support from their parents, but the government has to support to train the teachers and to be able to make life easier for the girls when it comes to education. </p> <p> One is Amina Ussef, she was one of the girls that we sponsored into secondary school. And she has completed her secondary school, she has been trained as a girl ambassador. She is a cascading mentor in the organisation. And when Malala came to Nigeria to talk to our president about the Chibok girls, Amina was one of the two girls that were there to meet with Malala. During this UN SDG the Malala fund again invited Amina to be one of the five girls that supported Malala when she spoke at the United Nations. I was there to meet her. </p> <p><strong> AU</strong> I\u2019m Amina Ussef from Nigeria. </p> <p><strong> HM</strong> The girl, Amina, always say if I hadn\u2019t gone to school nobody would have even known that I exist. </p> <p><strong> MY</strong> And I am Malala from Pakistan. </p> <p><strong> HM</strong> Most of the girls admire the teenager Malala because they feel that if she is in a position to speak on behalf of millions of girls in the world, why won\u2019t they stand and speak for Nigerian girls too? So I think it is something that is motivational. </p> <p><strong>LF</strong> Positive role models have proven to be a great motivator for younger girls. And for many women their first female role model is their mothers. Back at the Trust Women conference, Gila, Khawla and Suha agreed. </p> <p><strong> GR</strong> I think my mother was my role model because she\u2019s a really strong woman and she always worked even though she had two children on her own. </p> <p><strong> SZ</strong> I feel my mother, she\u2019s a great woman. She take care of 11 children and she work, she\u2019s religious but she never told me to cover my hair, for example. And to not participate in any activities that I like to be part of. </p> <p><strong> KQ</strong> Same here. My mum is my role model. She just went against traditions and society to have us get a really good education, and practise her own rights. And I really look up for her because she fought for her own rights.</p> <p><strong> GR</strong> As you can see, the three of us, we are successful women and we had strong role models. So if you don\u2019t have a role model at home, I think it\u2019s important for social workers, teachers to be role models. </p> <p><strong>LF</strong> Isha Johansen in Sierra Leone gets inspiration from the strength of women around her.</p> <p><strong> IJ</strong> For me, I think, the real people who have inspired me are the women of Africa, and just how they stand up for themselves up against adversity, and we have a lot of it. From conceiving, to childbirth, to fighting Ebola, fighting wars and wanting to fight for your place in society. So looking at these women, they\u2019re not complaining, they\u2019re just getting on with things and striving and surviving. They\u2019re my role models and they inspire me. </p> <p><strong>LF</strong> Habiba Mohamed from the Centre for Girls\u2019 Education started as a mentor in 2008, working in what they call safe spaces for girls. </p> <p><strong> HM</strong> In the safe spaces tents that I mentored, they include literacy and numeracy to enhance their reading and writing skills. We have issues that have to do with reproductive health and we have entrepreneurship skills too, which help these girls to be able to build their economic capacity, to want to do what they really enjoy doing in life. And they are other life skills like building their self-esteem, being able to negotiate with their parents on issues that have to do with maybe getting them married or getting them dropped out of school. And in the safe space too, we do this leadership training where girls become cascading mentors to other younger girls. </p> <p><strong>LF</strong> In September UN member states adopted the 17 sustainable development goals, one of which is dedicated to achieving gender equality. How will the SDGs help to get more women into power and break the glass ceiling? Yannick Glemarec from UN Women. </p> <p><strong> YG</strong> For the first time we have a universal normative framework that applies as much to the north in these countries than the south, that covers all the dimension of sustainable development; that has the ambition to \u201cleave no one behind\u201d. And so this universal agenda, de facto, is a very strong commitment to gender equality and the women empowerment. One of the 17 sustainable development goals is dedicated to gender equality and women empowerment, and, in addition, we have specific target in almost every single SDG to mainstream gender equality and women empowerment in our work in every culture, in nutrition, in climate change, in infrastructure, etc. </p> <p><strong>LF</strong> Suha Ziyada from the Shoruq Organisation in Palestine believes that in patriarchal societies women must be educated about their rights. </p> <p><strong> SZ</strong> Since our society is a patriarchal society, it\u2019s really important to involve men in taking action and advocating for women\u2019s rights \u2013 because it\u2019s a society controlled by men, and if they don\u2019t do change, who else is doing it? So it\u2019s important to engage men at really young ages to be involved in decision-making, or to be taught about women\u2019s rights and about how can they be active in the society and change it for a better future for women\u2019s rights. </p> <p><strong> YG</strong> Men can be a barrier if they believe that women empowerment means that somebody is to gain \u2013 women \u2013 and somebody is to lose \u2013 men. And that\u2019s the reason why it\u2019s extremely important to engage men and boys in the fostering of gender equality and women empowerment, making clear that when we speak about women empowerment we do not speak about a zero-sum game, we speak about a win-win option. </p> <p> Countries where women are in power are richer, healthier, more stable, happier; and the best way to basically remove the fears from some men that they are about to lose something is to engage them into this overall change management process. Your young woman is supporting a major campaign and the objective of the campaign is to basically reach out to men and boys and get them to make the commitment in terms of what they can do to support gender equality and women empowerment. And it\u2019s a very, very successful campaign. </p> <p><strong>LF</strong> Let\u2019s hear from Felicite Rwemalika. </p> <p><strong> FR</strong> Start them from when they are young, tell them they\u2019re all the same. So once they grow up, you find out in the near future we shall not have that problem again. All children will be equal and they will realise that they can make a difference. </p> <p><strong>LF</strong> So what does the future look like? For example, how would having a woman as president of Fifa make a difference? </p> <p><strong> IJ</strong> The mere fact that it would be female at the top, the novelty, would give the whole football world, the whole football management a new dimension, I think. I think we women, we come with a different form of management skills. I think we\u2019re definitely more affirmative \u2013 a no is a no and a yes is a yes. I don\u2019t think this talk in business of corruption would be so rife, if you like, if a woman were at the helm. I think with a woman at the head there would be a lot more love and understanding in the sport \u2013 yeah. </p> <p><strong>LF</strong> Yannick Glemarec believes that the targets set by the SDGs on gender equality are achievable. </p> <p><strong> YG</strong> What we know is that it\u2019s not impossible. That we do have the public policy instruments. We do have the business case to achieve it. So if there is a real political will there is no reason why we could not achieve at least political parity at the national level, maybe at the local level it might take some more time. If we could physically lower the structural barriers faced by women in terms of access to the labour market, we could increase the world GDP by $12tn. That means we could increase it by over 15%. And so a number of CEOs realise that gender equality and women empowerment, it\u2019s good business. And what we are seeing right now is that we are seeing increasingly a force to promote women in leadership positions and reduce the structural barriers that they face. </p> <p><strong> HM</strong> Our president always says: \u201cGive women a chance to choose, give them their voice, you should not choose for them.\u201d But the country will never develop if there is a certain group of people that are left behind. So they all have to come as a community, come up, and the country will be developed. </p> <p><strong> GR</strong> Hard as it is just building their capacity and their confidence to realise that in fact they can pursue whatever opportunity that they want. And I think part of that also has to do with the media, sort of demonstrating through the narrative that basically girls can participate in what they want and really highlighting the stories of girls and women who have been very successful in non-traditional fields. </p> <p><strong>LF</strong> Let\u2019s give the last word to Josephine Kulea, founder and executive director of the Sambura Girls Foundation in Kenya. </p> <p><strong> JK</strong> What I\u2019ll tell girls across the globe is: girls are powerful, girls have all it takes, and if they are just given the chance, especially those who are in school, you already have the chance, that is the only chance you need to be better than anyone out there. So you have the platform, use it well and do what your heart is calling you to do and follow your passion and your talents. </p> <p><strong>LF</strong> That\u2019s it from the Global development podcast this month.

So, for example, women may not push their way forward in the workforce in the same way as men. And I think what the private sector can do is really account for that, really set up programmes that increase gender diversity in the workforce. LF Felicite Rwemalika is from Rwanda, and is a CEO and founder of the Organisation of Women in Sports, whose main objective is empowering women through football. She recalls her path to a position of leadership. FR What I can say that women have sometimes the potential and they don\u2019t have the chance to express it out. My time came when my husband left me and went to liberate Rwanda. As a nurse, you cannot look after the four children and take them to school and look after you. So I set up a restaurant. I had a restaurant, I could work in the hospital in the morning, they even got the restaurant. So within those four years, this is when I realised I had the potential of being an entrepreneur. I had the potential of speaking out because of what I went through. So as time went on, I realised I could do business, I could speak out, I could try to see people changing their minds. I think it took me about 10 years to be accepted in the National Football Federation whereby I\u2019m the president of the Women\u2019s Football Commission, which didn\u2019t exist before. And I\u2019m on the board of the International Olympic Committee. And I won an award as an Ashoka fellow. So all this is just because I had a new idea of empowering women through sports, to expel the cultural and social beliefs that hinders or limits women\u2019s participation into the country\u2019s development. LF Let\u2019s go back to Sarah Iqbal from the World Bank. SI You see a lot of girls predominantly working in sectors or moving towards sectors where women predominate. So, for example, on the healthcare and education fields, which are both great, but the question is \u2013 girls should be able to work in any field that they want to whether it\u2019s a stem field, whether it\u2019s healthcare, education, whether it\u2019s entrepreneurship. Education is a key building block in determining what girls\u2019 aspirations are for their future lives. We\u2019ve seen actually really interesting models of where the private sector works with universities, works with secondary and tertiary education to actually increase the pipeline for girls and women in certain sectors. LF Habiba Mohamed is the team leader at the Centre for Girls\u2019 Education in Nigeria. HM I think the first step is for the government of Nigeria to be able to support the public schools in a way that the teachers are trained, the quality of the education in the school is very good, so that when these girls graduate from secondary school they are able to get the certificates that will qualify them to move to higher institutions. Like our first cohort of girls when they graduated I think it were \u2026 We had very few of them that were able to meet the criteria of moving to higher institutions. We need not only the support from their parents, but the government has to support to train the teachers and to be able to make life easier for the girls when it comes to education. One is Amina Ussef, she was one of the girls that we sponsored into secondary school. And she has completed her secondary school, she has been trained as a girl ambassador. She is a cascading mentor in the organisation. And when Malala came to Nigeria to talk to our president about the Chibok girls, Amina was one of the two girls that were there to meet with Malala. During this UN SDG the Malala fund again invited Amina to be one of the five girls that supported Malala when she spoke at the United Nations. I was there to meet her. AU I\u2019m Amina Ussef from Nigeria. HM The girl, Amina, always say if I hadn\u2019t gone to school nobody would have even known that I exist. MY And I am Malala from Pakistan. HM Most of the girls admire the teenager Malala because they feel that if she is in a position to speak on behalf of millions of girls in the world, why won\u2019t they stand and speak for Nigerian girls too? So I think it is something that is motivational. LF Positive role models have proven to be a great motivator for younger girls. And for many women their first female role model is their mothers. Back at the Trust Women conference, Gila, Khawla and Suha agreed. GR I think my mother was my role model because she\u2019s a really strong woman and she always worked even though she had two children on her own. SZ I feel my mother, she\u2019s a great woman. She take care of 11 children and she work, she\u2019s religious but she never told me to cover my hair, for example. And to not participate in any activities that I like to be part of. KQ Same here. My mum is my role model. She just went against traditions and society to have us get a really good education, and practise her own rights. And I really look up for her because she fought for her own rights. GR As you can see, the three of us, we are successful women and we had strong role models. So if you don\u2019t have a role model at home, I think it\u2019s important for social workers, teachers to be role models. LF Isha Johansen in Sierra Leone gets inspiration from the strength of women around her. IJ For me, I think, the real people who have inspired me are the women of Africa, and just how they stand up for themselves up against adversity, and we have a lot of it. From conceiving, to childbirth, to fighting Ebola, fighting wars and wanting to fight for your place in society. So looking at these women, they\u2019re not complaining, they\u2019re just getting on with things and striving and surviving. They\u2019re my role models and they inspire me. LF Habiba Mohamed from the Centre for Girls\u2019 Education started as a mentor in 2008, working in what they call safe spaces for girls. HM In the safe spaces tents that I mentored, they include literacy and numeracy to enhance their reading and writing skills. We have issues that have to do with reproductive health and we have entrepreneurship skills too, which help these girls to be able to build their economic capacity, to want to do what they really enjoy doing in life. And they are other life skills like building their self-esteem, being able to negotiate with their parents on issues that have to do with maybe getting them married or getting them dropped out of school. And in the safe space too, we do this leadership training where girls become cascading mentors to other younger girls. LF In September UN member states adopted the 17 sustainable development goals, one of which is dedicated to achieving gender equality. How will the SDGs help to get more women into power and break the glass ceiling? Yannick Glemarec from UN Women. YG For the first time we have a universal normative framework that applies as much to the north in these countries than the south, that covers all the dimension of sustainable development; that has the ambition to \u201cleave no one behind\u201d. And so this universal agenda, de facto, is a very strong commitment to gender equality and the women empowerment. One of the 17 sustainable development goals is dedicated to gender equality and women empowerment, and, in addition, we have specific target in almost every single SDG to mainstream gender equality and women empowerment in our work in every culture, in nutrition, in climate change, in infrastructure, etc. LF Suha Ziyada from the Shoruq Organisation in Palestine believes that in patriarchal societies women must be educated about their rights. SZ Since our society is a patriarchal society, it\u2019s really important to involve men in taking action and advocating for women\u2019s rights \u2013 because it\u2019s a society controlled by men, and if they don\u2019t do change, who else is doing it? So it\u2019s important to engage men at really young ages to be involved in decision-making, or to be taught about women\u2019s rights and about how can they be active in the society and change it for a better future for women\u2019s rights. YG Men can be a barrier if they believe that women empowerment means that somebody is to gain \u2013 women \u2013 and somebody is to lose \u2013 men. And that\u2019s the reason why it\u2019s extremely important to engage men and boys in the fostering of gender equality and women empowerment, making clear that when we speak about women empowerment we do not speak about a zero-sum game, we speak about a win-win option. Countries where women are in power are richer, healthier, more stable, happier; and the best way to basically remove the fears from some men that they are about to lose something is to engage them into this overall change management process. Your young woman is supporting a major campaign and the objective of the campaign is to basically reach out to men and boys and get them to make the commitment in terms of what they can do to support gender equality and women empowerment. And it\u2019s a very, very successful campaign. LF Let\u2019s hear from Felicite Rwemalika. FR Start them from when they are young, tell them they\u2019re all the same. So once they grow up, you find out in the near future we shall not have that problem again. All children will be equal and they will realise that they can make a difference. LF So what does the future look like? For example, how would having a woman as president of Fifa make a difference? IJ The mere fact that it would be female at the top, the novelty, would give the whole football world, the whole football management a new dimension, I think. I think we women, we come with a different form of management skills. I think we\u2019re definitely more affirmative \u2013 a no is a no and a yes is a yes. I don\u2019t think this talk in business of corruption would be so rife, if you like, if a woman were at the helm. I think with a woman at the head there would be a lot more love and understanding in the sport \u2013 yeah. LF Yannick Glemarec believes that the targets set by the SDGs on gender equality are achievable. YG What we know is that it\u2019s not impossible. That we do have the public policy instruments. We do have the business case to achieve it. So if there is a real political will there is no reason why we could not achieve at least political parity at the national level, maybe at the local level it might take some more time. If we could physically lower the structural barriers faced by women in terms of access to the labour market, we could increase the world GDP by $12tn. That means we could increase it by over 15%. And so a number of CEOs realise that gender equality and women empowerment, it\u2019s good business. And what we are seeing right now is that we are seeing increasingly a force to promote women in leadership positions and reduce the structural barriers that they face. HM Our president always says: \u201cGive women a chance to choose, give them their voice, you should not choose for them.\u201d But the country will never develop if there is a certain group of people that are left behind. So they all have to come as a community, come up, and the country will be developed. GR Hard as it is just building their capacity and their confidence to realise that in fact they can pursue whatever opportunity that they want. And I think part of that also has to do with the media, sort of demonstrating through the narrative that basically girls can participate in what they want and really highlighting the stories of girls and women who have been very successful in non-traditional fields. LF Let\u2019s give the last word to Josephine Kulea, founder and executive director of the Sambura Girls Foundation in Kenya. JK What I\u2019ll tell girls across the globe is: girls are powerful, girls have all it takes, and if they are just given the chance, especially those who are in school, you already have the chance, that is the only chance you need to be better than anyone out there. So you have the platform, use it well and do what your heart is calling you to do and follow your passion and your talents. LF That\u2019s it from the Global development podcast this month.
