This performance can draw from 20 years of solo material \u2013 and a host of Take That hits perhaps. Much of it is guff, of course, so does he control his volatility and pick out the pearls? Quite emphatically not. Underwear models parade past him to the strains of Welcome to the Heavy Entertainment Show as if TFI Friday never happened. He promises us that we can go home soon, but not before submitting us to songs that only the most craven performer would include in a lifetime achievement segment. He segues into I Love My Life, a 12-step affirmation bolted onto a Coldplay B-side; like Jeff Goldblum in Annie Hall, his is a mantra that is instantly forgettable. He then channels Jon Bon Jovi\u2019s nasal wondering for Mixed Signals, a guitar anthem so anti-anthemic it\u2019s evaporated from my head mere seconds after hearing it. In the crowd, five people point fingers to the sky while the rest stand stock still like characters contemplating their imminent death in a Roland Emmerich movie. It ends. Angels, She\u2019s the One, Let Me Entertain You \u2026 all remain ignored by a performer who, for better but more often for worse, is at least convinced of his own unwavering brilliance.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58ae08d6e4b08ddc9a5e2a70\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/harriet-gibsone\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-02-22T21:58:40.491Z\">9.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Rob, mate.

This is far from the clunky Rihanna-Klaxons Brits juxtapositions of old \u2013 lest we forget, Sheeran has an improbably robust grime pedigree via his early mixtapes.

In a synergistic marketing push that must have involved a lot of passive-aggressive emails between Warners, Sony and Spotify, Coldplay\u2019s collaboration with the Chainsmokers, Something Just Like This, dropped just before the Brits ceremony. It makes a lot of sense \u2013 the two groups share earnestly uplifting, entirely generic neon-hued feels \u2013 and I would happily bound around to it on my fifth mixed-berries Kopparberg at Wireless this summer. Martin stage dives into the crowd, who follow the presumably stern talking-to they had before the performance, and keep their hands where we can see them; the guitar soloing lifts the final minute just as it did the 1975. It could be a Closer-sized hit, but whether the Chainsmokers can sustain their single songwriting style \u2013 tongue-lolling, molly-friendly buildup crashing into three-note instrumental chorus \u2013 beyond one spring break cycle is very much up for debate.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-02-22T21:40:52.349Z\">at 9.40pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58ae00bae4b030b6f7c8e1cc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/harriet-gibsone\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-02-22T21:22:50.001Z\">9.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Coldplay are performing their new song with the Chainsmokers.

Which is already slightly more titillating than 2016. I\u2019m struggling to think of anything that actually happened last year apart from:</p> <ul> <li>Ant and Dec being present</li> <li>Adele capturing the nation\u2019s heart with her humility</li> <li>Campfire bros Justin Bieber and James Bay playing the acoustic guitar in front of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djzDWMy1z7k\">an unruly BBQ</a></li> </ul> <p>Apparently seven more things happened - here\u2019s a blog about what we<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/25/10-things-we-learned-from-the-2016-brit-awards\"> learned from last year\u2019s event to refresh your memory</a>.</p> <p>The big issue that resounded in the aftermath of 2016\u2019s ceremony was that the Brits urgently needed to rethink its voting process. After the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/24/brits-so-white-why-this-years-nominees-need-to-take-a-stand\">#BritsSoWhite</a> controversy exposed the frustration of artists and fans who felt British music was not being fully represented, organisers decided to take action and make the Brits board more diverse (<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/feb/16/how-the-brit-awards-responded-to-britssowhite\">read more about that here</a>). Let\u2019s hope their promise to be more inclusive is not just an empty gesture, but that they actually follow through. Not like that! Although watching Dermot O\u2019Leary defecate live on ITV <em tabindex=\"-1\">would</em> liven things up a bit. </p> <p>It\u2019s an exciting period for British music. Not only have artists proven that they can shift huge units across the world (Adele, Ed Sheeran, the 1975) but the leading voices in grime have beaten the bureaucracy and confines of the major label system to break into the mainstream. It is now the UK\u2019s most exciting and innovative export. Hopefully that is celebrated tonight (and hopefully this moment of solemnity will regain me some dignity after that hideous thing about Dermot). </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-02-22T19:13:35.521Z\">at 7.13pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58adc6cae4b05f755cc0b4d1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/harriet-gibsone\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-02-22T19:01:10.542Z\">7.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Welcome to the Brits 2017 liveblog!</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Roses are red </p> <p>Violets are blue </p> <p>This is the Brits live blog</p> <p>Lee Ryan from Blue.</p> </blockquote> <p>Hello everyone!

          "bodyText": "And that\u2019s all from the Brits. If you\u2019re after specifics I would say it was a 15% improvement on last year. But my goodness we have a long way still to go. I suppose all that\u2019s left for me to do is write some kind of neat retort, some sort of rhyme based polemic which neatly summarises the evening\u2019s events? Little Mix, a bag of tricks! It started really well Dermot and Emma were not bad but \u201coff-ish\u201d - sort of like a bad smell? Rag\u2019n\u2019Bone man succeeded, a man of few words he is If only there were more mavericks like Skepta in this business we call showbiz? Chris Martin was there, a very enthusiastic fella Jamie Vardy hands Leicester Champions League lifeline against Sevilla Now I am tired and actually quite worried this whole poetry thing was twee and crap All that\u2019s left for me to say is, that\u2019s a rap! Robbie didn\u2019t deserve a mention. Goodnight everyone. See you next year. Across the periodic table from the inert gases that most British male singers are formed from (eg James Bay, Ben Howard, even Rag\u2019n\u2019Bone Man), Robbie Williams is made from a violently unstable element, his charisma doing tequila shots with his ego and id until they come up with genius or Rudebox. This performance can draw from 20 years of solo material \u2013 and a host of Take That hits perhaps. Much of it is guff, of course, so does he control his volatility and pick out the pearls? Quite emphatically not. Underwear models parade past him to the strains of Welcome to the Heavy Entertainment Show as if TFI Friday never happened. He promises us that we can go home soon, but not before submitting us to songs that only the most craven performer would include in a lifetime achievement segment. He segues into I Love My Life, a 12-step affirmation bolted onto a Coldplay B-side; like Jeff Goldblum in Annie Hall, his is a mantra that is instantly forgettable. He then channels Jon Bon Jovi\u2019s nasal wondering for Mixed Signals, a guitar anthem so anti-anthemic it\u2019s evaporated from my head mere seconds after hearing it. In the crowd, five people point fingers to the sky while the rest stand stock still like characters contemplating their imminent death in a Roland Emmerich movie. It ends. Angels, She\u2019s the One, Let Me Entertain You \u2026 all remain ignored by a performer who, for better but more often for worse, is at least convinced of his own unwavering brilliance. Rob, mate. What happened there? We wanted the hits and you gave us some bemused gurns and a saggy rendition of some new songs nobody knows yet. What I said about British music being in rude health earlier, I take back. This is truly Brexit Britain. Let\u2019s celebrate the complacency of mediocre white men forever! Here\u2019s another way to look at it: So that\u2019s it? Skepta and Little Mix won in terms of performances, but for not a single grime artist to win a prize seems massively out of touch. A monotonous list of winners. Robbie\u2019s now on stage singing about how he loves his life and is free and whatever. If all these scantily clad women dancing around him don\u2019t prove we\u2019ve made progress then I don\u2019t know what will! (A friend just texted me that observation but it\u2019s that stage of the night where I\u2019ll honestly accept anything.) Organisers of awards shows must love Ed Sheeran, as he can blow (well, mouth-breathe) everyone away with an acoustic guitar and a mic while they get on with erecting a candy-floss zebra for Katy Perry to flirt with. But here he\u2019s got a full band, covering the Mumford and Sons classic Castle on the Hill. Then it\u2019s a much more robust Shape of You than the Grammys \u2013 it\u2019s good to see him connecting with the song\u2019s full dancehall wine, rather than craning his neck downwards to check if his vocals are looped properly. Screams abound for Stormzy, coming out for a brand new guest verse and instantly obviating the unofficial remixes from Yung Bxne et al \u2013 studio version please! This is far from the clunky Rihanna-Klaxons Brits juxtapositions of old \u2013 lest we forget, Sheeran has an improbably robust grime pedigree via his early mixtapes. The Brits, pleasantly diverting as it often is, rarely nails the best of British \u2013 but this performance is the beating heart of the nation\u2019s homegrown pop. Duncan Jones is here to collect his award. He gave a short and sweet speech about his father, talking of how his dad always supported people who thought they were a bit weird or different: \u201cThis award is for the kooks and the people who make the kooks.\u201d Michael Hann\u2019s verdict: \u201cBowie never won a best album award at the Brits while he was alive, which surely proves he never made a good album until now, because the Brits voters would never fail to reward the best music, would they? But now, at last, posthumously, he has reached the crowning glory of his career. To paraphrase an old Robbie Williams gag, he\u2019s looking down on the Brits tonight \u2013 not because he\u2019s dead, he\u2019s just really condescending. The real winner tonight was Jamie Vardy\u2019s away goal that has kept Leicester City\u2019s Champions League dreams alive! Nice work, football! I am a bit sleepy so here are some tweets about Ed Sheeran\u2019s performance: ... sorry best video. Voted by fans. Turns out One Direction are big online? Just Liam is here to pick up the prize. Doesn\u2019t mean the band are going to split though. Still best mates. Everything\u2019s fine. One Direction for life! Chris Martin\u2019s back! Following A Sky Full of Stars with Avicii, Martin\u2019s \u201ccollaborations with EDM bros who\u2019ll take me to bars and get me waved with 22-year-old sportswear models\u201d phase continues. It\u2019s what George Michael would have wanted. In a synergistic marketing push that must have involved a lot of passive-aggressive emails between Warners, Sony and Spotify, Coldplay\u2019s collaboration with the Chainsmokers, Something Just Like This, dropped just before the Brits ceremony. It makes a lot of sense \u2013 the two groups share earnestly uplifting, entirely generic neon-hued feels \u2013 and I would happily bound around to it on my fifth mixed-berries Kopparberg at Wireless this summer. Martin stage dives into the crowd, who follow the presumably stern talking-to they had before the performance, and keep their hands where we can see them; the guitar soloing lifts the final minute just as it did the 1975. It could be a Closer-sized hit, but whether the Chainsmokers can sustain their single songwriting style \u2013 tongue-lolling, molly-friendly buildup crashing into three-note instrumental chorus \u2013 beyond one spring break cycle is very much up for debate. Coldplay are performing their new song with the Chainsmokers. Ben will submit his proper review in a minute but in the meantime I\u2019d like to do a poem. I love Coldplay Honestly I do But they are really testing my limits Justin Trudeau A Tribe Called Quest and Beyonc\u00e9 win awards but can\u2019t be arsed to send in a video message. This is a new low. Here\u2019s Mr Hann\u2019s verdict: Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 best international female Ha! Stick that in your Grammy-shaped pipe and smoke it, America! That said, who else was going to win? Much as we\u2019d have loved to see Christine and the Queens or Solange get the nod, it was never going to happen, was it? A Tribe Called Quest \u2013 best international group Wow. Didn\u2019t see that one coming. Even though Foo Fighters weren\u2019t nominated, we assumed they would somehow win this one, like they always do (it turns out they\u2019ve only won it three times, it just feels like more). This is one we can surely all celebrate: a great, returning (and now disappearing again) group, who made a fantastic album, lost a much-loved member, and emerged admired by everyone. Well done, chaps. Kanye brought on every grime MC in a 10-mile radius for his performance in 2015, and the Brits managed to ignore absolutely all of them the following year, resulting in much well-deserved #BritsSoWhite hashtaggery. But better late than never, as Skepta delivers Shutdown here in a pulled-up hoodie. As he lifts his fists aloft to the racist comments bandied about that very Kanye performance played over the PA, it\u2019s a big symbolic win for grime by the mainstream \u2013 but he should still be able to deliver \u201cwha gwan sexy\u201d at the climax of the final verse. \u201cRing, ring pussy\u201d doesn\u2019t get past the ITV censors, so congrats to them. A shame perhaps that there was no cameo from fellow grime nominee Kano, who has come out at Skepta\u2019s recent live shows, and indeed recent London tourist and collaborator Drake \u2013 but at least we didn\u2019t have to listen to the latter\u2019s chat about \u201con road\u201d and \u201cends\u201d and \u201cpengest munch\u201d in a bid to win some UK cred. Given he was No 1 for pretty much all of 2016, this one doesn\u2019t come as much of a surprise. The amazing thing is that so few people can remember the song that was No 1 for most of 2016. Or even name it. (We can. One Dance. Not telling you if we had to Google it.) These are the rewards of going Full Mope. Presumably, he\u2019ll be spending tonight at some party, off his nut on drugs, getting propositioned by serial supermodels and then complaining about it. Mate, if it\u2019s that bad, go home and watch repeats of Breaking Bad. Here\u2019s Skepta teaching the music world how it\u2019s done. One man, boundless energy, charisma and a couple of red lasers. Even Simon Cowell stood up to applaud \u2013 possibly wondering how he could cash in on grime. The complaint sampled from Kanye\u2019s Brit\u2019s performance in 2015 was a landmark moment for grime. Well done everyone. Also relevant: With its lyrics about rose-tinted glasses and living in a bubble, Chained to the Rhythm sees Katy Perry ushering in the \u201cwoke\u201d phase of her career. Do we want the architect of boozy escapism to suddenly start pulling on your sleeve and pointing at Ta-Nehisi Coates articles on your iPad? Perhaps not, but rest assured Perry\u2019s brand of resistance is as non-specific as a placard at a Corbyn rally. After her \u201cfreedom is good, yeah?\u201d unveiling of the Declaration of Independence at the Grammys, she appears here amid a wee town made of cardboard houses, as a pair of giant besuited skeletons \u2013 HERE REPRESENTING CAPITALISM \u2013 come out to dance like Boris and Theresa at the Conservative party conference. It\u2019s a decent song, but then again the lead track off a Katy Perry album should be, and she looks about 14% as arsed as she was at the Grammys. Dermot is so desperate to get some decent quotes from Rag\u2019n\u2019Bone Man that he\u2019s literally asking him about his cat. Here\u2019s the boring Adele bit. We\u2019re all about cross pollination here at the Guardian. So if anyone\u2019s wondering what\u2019s going on on the football liveblog: Sevilla 1 \u2013 0 Leiscester. Apparently Gray has come on for Musa, whose last act of the evening was to run the ball out of play for a goal kick down the left, while in a decent position. Musa was apparently dismal tonight; his lack of tracking back and closing down allowed Escudero the time and space to cross for Sevilla\u2019s goal. Here\u2019s Katy Perry \u2013 who last year discovered inequality and activism \u2013 performing her reggae protest song about apathy. Her performance includes dancers dressed as houses (to make people aware of the housing crisis) and skeletons (to raise concern for veganism and possible cannibalism). Really makes you think. Fantastic. They even got lost on their way to the podium. I think we can all get on board with Little Mix even if the music\u2019s not your cup of tea. They\u2019re the sort of girls who\u2019d share their deodorant with you. \u201cCheers to our exes!\u201d one of them says. \u201cThis one\u2019s for you lads.\u201d Every bit of me was clenched ahead of watching Adele do Fastlove for the Grammys\u2019 George Michael tribute \u2013 how could a dance song about queer sexuality sung by a weed-smoking bacchant get a string section added to it? But it was quite classy in the end. And so is the Brits\u2019 effort. Here we have Chris Martin performing A Different Corner, its warm wash of synths transposed into Coldplay\u2019s quintessential Christmas-lights piano \u2013 along with George himself in a compelling duet from beyond the grave. The way their voices chime together shows how Martin has quite a debt to pay to Michael\u2019s earnest baritone \u2013 his ability to distil complex, messy emotions into universal lighters-aloft moments is surely drawn in part from George. There\u2019s a deservingly resounding round of applause. Andrew Ridgeley, Pepsi and Shirlie are on stage. It\u2019s the history of Wham! An emotional tribute to George Michael. Touching. A beautiful celebration of a great star\u2019s kindness and talent. I took a quick dip into the comments section to see how our dear Guardian readers are responding to the awards. It\u2019s an abattoir. Like a priapic Irish water spaniel let loose in Zara Men, frontman Matty Healy has led the 1975 to the edge of stadiums, and tonight they continue their pan-generational charm offensive. It\u2019s a bit like watching your sister\u2019s boyfriend talk to your dad about football while playing footsie under the table with your mum \u2013 with their INXS guitars, Duran Duran synths and Healy\u2019s Dionysian charisma, no one is immune to their erudite soft-cock rock. They play The Sound with a full gospel choir \u2013 classic 80s white-band move! \u2013 and while Healy\u2019s vocals start out a little high in the mix, everything coheres a bit more when he starts bantering with the world\u2019s neatest mosh pit. The comment section disses from the video get flashed up amid it all in a pleasantly vanilla bit of culture jamming, and the exquisite guitar solo carries the whole thing home. Still an absolute jam \u2013 now where\u2019s my girlfriend? News just in \u2013 David Bowie\u2019s son Duncan Jones has been spotted in the audience tonight. Could this mean Bowie gets a second award? Or might he be Ed Sheeran\u2019s special on-stage guest? Ed: \u201cYou need me man, I don\u2019t need you!\u201d Duncan on backing vocals, pointing: \u201cNeed you!\u201d Meanwhile, the Rag\u2019n\u2019Bone man fallout begins: Matt Healy is back on screen. If I were a poet \u2013 and some blogs have started to call me one since this liveblog started \u2013 I would change the lyrics to: Well I know when you\u2019re around \u2018cause I know the sound I know the sound, of your heart \u2013 I hate Brexit! Well I know when you\u2019re around \u2019cause I know the sound I know the sound, of your heart \u2013 Scotland, do NOT make an exit! As the patron saint of the battling-with-adversity montage, Emeli Sand\u00e9\u2019s performance should probably come backed with a slo-mo multipanel video of the Brownlee brothers, those baby iguanas from Planet Earth and Michelle Obama at Trump\u2019s inauguration. Instead, it comes accompanied by jagged moves by a troupe of clapping dancers. Outside of video editing suites though, her latest album slid off the zeitgeist faster than a lubed blancmange \u2013 but don\u2019t underestimate major labels\u2019 doggedness in making it A Thing, as here she is with a live performance among pop\u2019s top table, following her best British female solo artist win earlier in the evening. And this performance of Hurts is a reminder that her record Long Live the Angels \u2013 while uneven \u2013 was unjustly overlooked by most flesh-and-blood Brits. Her nimble flow shows she has one foot firmly in the world of rap, with the other in the balladeering she\u2019s known for. Blending the two is no mean feat, but she does it with clear-eyed conviction on Hurts. Here\u2019s to more of the former on her next album perhaps, rather than more beige montage fodder? Well done Rag? Bone Man? \u2018N? By well done, I mean this is an absolute travesty. He\u2019s already got a Critics Choice award and has sold a bucket load of albums. He beat Skepta and Stormzy to win this. \u201cOh my days,\u201d he says. He giggles a bit and that\u2019s it. Now Ed Sheeran is on with his new glasses. Trendy glasses. Sorry for saying trendy. Who\u2019s into history? Let\u2019s go back to 2007 and see what state the ceremony was in 10 years ago ... The host was comic and lothario Russell Brand who referred to the awards as a \u201ccarnival of mayhem\u201d. In reality it was more like a \u201cconvention of mild disruption\u201d. The show received more than 400 complaints in total, entirely based on Brand\u2019s blue, off-script rambling. \u201cCan you genuinely say that if someone gives you an envelope with a photo of the Queen\u2019s privates inside,\u201d he rambled at one point, \u201c... you wouldn\u2019t have a look?\u201d Aside from Brand, however, the only real shocking moment of the whole show was Joss Stone\u2019s accent, which, Alexis Petridis said, \u201cseems to have unexpectedly relocated itself from her birthplace in Devon to somewhere in the deep south of America\u201d. The moral of this post is that the Brits have been a bit iffy for a decade. Emeli is on and the mood\u2019s a little bleak, so let\u2019s raise spirits and check out what Twitter thinks of Dermot and Emma\u2019s presenting: Michael C Hall is here to collect the award for the late star. He says some nice stuff about kindness and artistic vitality. Last time Bowie won, Kate Moss arrived in a catsuit and made a speech about Japanese myth and rabbits and urged Scotland to \u201cstay with us\u201d. (Seriously, though, Scotland, if you\u2019re reading, please do actually stay with us. Just for a little bit longer. I know we\u2019ve been awful recently but we\u2019re going to get some therapy and hopefully this will all blow over soon and you can forgive us.) Here\u2019s what Michael Hann has to say about Bowie\u2019s win: \u201cThe late David Bowie has completed a hat-trick of male solo artist Brits wins, following his wins in 1984 and 2014! This time it\u2019s in the wake of Blackstar, for having died and become even more untouchable than he was before, and \u2013 perhaps \u2013 because he\u2019s been listened to more this past year than ever before (in the immediate wake of his death, global streams of his songs increased by 2,822%, pop fans). Hard to quibble, even if \u2013 whisper it \u2013 Blackstar isn\u2019t really as much fun as, say, Ziggy Stardust and \u2013 whisper it even more quietly \u2013 Lazarus was bloody awful.\u201d Matty \u2013 one of our great hopes for controversy and excitement \u2013 did a short speech about being in a band, purity, the album, before nearly but not quite talking about politics. He said that a lot of artists are told to \u201cstay in your lane when it comes to social issues but if you have a platform \u2013 don\u2019t do that\u201d. It\u2019s not quite \u201cBoo to Brexit! I hate Tories!\u201d but it will do. For now. Here\u2019s a picture of the band looking like Laurence Llewelyn Bowen\u2019s love children. The single wrong thing the Guardian has ever published \u2013 wronger than How Not to Let Kale Ruin Your Marriage \u2013 is this review of Bruno Mars\u2019s Superbowl performance, in which Hermione Hoby, instead of admiring it as the irrepressible pinnacle of pop entertainment that it was, said it was \u201calmost as dull as the football\u201d. But where once these Bruno haters proudly walked among us, three years on and one Uptown Funk later, their numbers have dwindled to almost zero and they are forced to live underground, listening to London Grammar. The rest of us can revel here in his sensual bedroom funk, and his utterly ridiculous shirt, last seen in a Kettering indoor market circa 1992. That\u2019s What I Like is another of his recent 80s pastiches, this one straight from the Galaxy and Flake adverts school of love jams. Bruno tells us a series of things he likes \u2013 sex by the fire at night, silk sheets and diamonds all white \u2013 that are utterly unsurprising, but it\u2019s OK because they are things that literally everyone else likes as well. There\u2019s a nicely harmonised breakdown, and while the sight of a three-foot Hawaiian thrusting his crotch doesn\u2019t really do it for me erotically speaking, it\u2019s certainly on beat. Lots of people seem to hate them, because Matty Healy is fabulously gobby (and because lots of their fans are teenage girls, and Real Music Fans don\u2019t like that). But their second album, I Like It When You Sleep, For I Can Keep On Making The Title Of My Album Longer Without You Noticing won a tonne of people around for being sharp, clever and packed with pop bangers alongside a big dollop of darkness. Odds on that this will be the most bonkers speech. Radiohead, nominated in this category, have still never won a Brit. \u201cWhy is he wearing an old Crystal Palace kit?\u201d \u2013 more scathing criticism thrown at the TV screen from the office, this time Michael Hann on Bruno Mars. Emeli Sand\u00e9 thanked \u201cthe creator of all things\u201d and her sister Lucy \u2013 \u201cthis award is for you\u201d \u2013 who came on stage with her to accept the award. I don\u2019t want to spread rumours, but I heard Lucy writes all of Sand\u00e9\u2019s songs and was contractually obliged to attend the Brits after five years of rigorous and private ballad scribing. Spread it! Thanks to their infectious realness, at least one solid gold banger per album and athleisure outfits seemingly taken from a pornographic remake of 2001: A Space Odyssey, Little Mix are the biggest (only?) pure pop group in the UK right now. Ditching the X Factor final ensembles that made Jesy look as if she\u2019d urinated on herself, they instead plump for frosty silver numbers last seen on a Star Trek Beyond mood board. After screaming like banshees at the audience, they arrive on mirrored sedan chairs, before heavily channelling Janet Jackson Rhythm Nation military-industrial vibes alongside some silver-coloured Blue Man Group wannabes. They perform Shout Out to My Ex \u2013 the solid gold banger for this particular album \u2013 and its blend of Appalachian hoedown and pep rally for jilted One Direction exes gets the evening off to a brilliantly bombastic start. You what? When she won this award in 2013, she was bestraddling British music like a montage-friendly colossus. There was literally no major event in the UK that did not need the presence of Emeli Sand\u00e9 to prove it counted. This time? Not so much. Her second album, Long Live the Angels, has sold a 10th of her debut (admittedly, it was a December release, so there weren\u2019t so many Olympics and what not for her to appear at). \u201cShit outfit\u201d \u201cWear a shirt mate\u201d - just some of the abuse hurled at David Tennant from the Guardian staffers just now. Little Mix have gone full Michael and Janet Jackson Scream-era with their frosty, futuristic entrance. This is a promising start \u2013 especially considering that two years ago it involved lots of trapeze artists jumping all over a table full of food. Here\u2019s Emma Willis and Dermot O\u2019Leary Hope everyone is feeling cheery? While I am here I may as well ask, which artists do you think have studied music theory? Here we go then. Hopefully everyone is enjoying Coronation Street on ITV before the Brits begin. I\u2019ve got it on in the background while listening to the new Coldplay and Chainsmokers single on Spotify. Terrible sensory overload. Would not recommend. I\u2019ve had a quick look at the star\u2019s sartorial choices on the red carpet. You might want to bulk buy black polo necks pronto. This year we\u2019re expecting live performances from Ed Sheeran (plus a secret guest), Katy Perry, Skepta, Bruno Mars, the 1975, Little Mix, Emeli Sand\u00e9 and Robbie Williams. Which is already slightly more titillating than 2016. I\u2019m struggling to think of anything that actually happened last year apart from: Ant and Dec being present Adele capturing the nation\u2019s heart with her humility Campfire bros Justin Bieber and James Bay playing the acoustic guitar in front of an unruly BBQ Apparently seven more things happened - here\u2019s a blog about what we learned from last year\u2019s event to refresh your memory. The big issue that resounded in the aftermath of 2016\u2019s ceremony was that the Brits urgently needed to rethink its voting process. After the #BritsSoWhite controversy exposed the frustration of artists and fans who felt British music was not being fully represented, organisers decided to take action and make the Brits board more diverse (read more about that here). Let\u2019s hope their promise to be more inclusive is not just an empty gesture, but that they actually follow through. Not like that! Although watching Dermot O\u2019Leary defecate live on ITV would liven things up a bit. It\u2019s an exciting period for British music. Not only have artists proven that they can shift huge units across the world (Adele, Ed Sheeran, the 1975) but the leading voices in grime have beaten the bureaucracy and confines of the major label system to break into the mainstream. It is now the UK\u2019s most exciting and innovative export. Hopefully that is celebrated tonight (and hopefully this moment of solemnity will regain me some dignity after that hideous thing about Dermot). Roses are red Violets are blue This is the Brits live blog Lee Ryan from Blue. Hello everyone! What better way to kick-start the most exciting event in the music calendar than a short verse of romantic poetry? First of all, I would like to congratulate you for simply being here. In the 12 months since our last Brits blog, you\u2019ve managed to navigate near-apocalyptic levels of political and societal upheaval, while also trying to maintain a healthy diet and consuming 15 box sets per month in order to stay relevant. It\u2019s been exhausting. But things are looking up. Milo Yiannopoulos has lost his book deal and it\u2019s feeling a bit like spring \u2013 let\u2019s all climb aboard the revolution and listen to Katy Perry sing! No more poetry after this, I promise.",

(See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/feb/20/paul-nuttall-ukip-chairmen-quit-in-protest-over-paul-nuttalls-hillsborough-falsehoold-politics-live?page=with:block-58ab1b68e4b05f755cc0aa06#block-58ab1b68e4b05f755cc0aa06\"> 4.42pm.)</a> MPs divided almost entirely along party lines, with Conservative MPs defending the decision to invite Trump (if not defending his policies), but opposition MPs criticising Trump much more aggressively, and arguing that the honour of a state visit was unmerited. But, wrapping up for government, Duncan said that state visits were the government\u2019s \u201cmost important diplomatic tool\u201d and he made it clear that the government expected the invitation to boost Britain\u2019s diplomatic interests. He told MPs:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A state visit is a uniquely British construct. No other country is able to offer a state visit in quite the same way as we do. It is distinctively British. And over the course of her reign Her Majesty has hosted over 100 of them. All such visits are a rare and prestigious occasion. But they are also our most important diplomatic tool. They enable us to strengthen and influence those international relationships that are of the greatest strategic importance to this country. </p> </blockquote> <p>The debate ended without MPs voting on whether the visit should go ahead and the debate will have no impact on the government\u2019s plans. But, alongside the parallel Stop Trump protests taking place in Parliament Square and in other British cities this evening, it illustrated just how much opposition Trump will face when he arrives on British soil. Duncan ended his speech saying he hoped Trump would get a \u201cpolite and generous\u201d welcome.

MPs are not allowed to sit on the main benches of the Lords but May is permitted to watch proceedings from the steps of the throne as a privy counsellor. In practice, this rarely happens.

Instead it is being held in Westminster Hall, a mini chamber, or annex, off <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/building/palace/westminsterhall/\">the historic Westminster Hall</a> (same name, but different room) that gets used for low-level debates that do not involve legislation or votes.</p> <p>Today\u2019s debate is taking place because the Commons has a rule that says petitions that attract more than 100,000 signatures should normally be considered for debate. <a href=\"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/171928/\">The main petition about Trump has been signed by 1.8m people.</a> It says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Donald Trump should be allowed to enter the UK in his capacity as head of the US Government, but he should not be invited to make an official State Visit because it would cause embarrassment to Her Majesty the Queen.</p> </blockquote> <p>But MPs will also be debating a rival petition saying Trump should get a state visit. <a href=\"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/178844\">It has been signed by 312,000 people</a> and it says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Donald Trump should be invited to make an official State Visit because he is the leader of a free world and U.K. is a country that supports free speech and does not believe that people that appose our point of view should be gagged.</p> </blockquote> <p>The debate will be opened by the Labour MP Paul Flynn, a member of the Commons petitions committee, which decides which petitions get debated. At some point Sir Alan Duncan, the deputy foreign secretary, will respond on behalf of the government.</p> <p>In some respects the whole affair will be quite pointless.

Natalie Evans, the newish and young (she is 41) leader of the Lords kicked off, but her speech was perfunctory. Angela Smith, her Labour opposite number, and Lord Newby, the Lib Dem leader in the Lords, were much better. Here are the key points.</p> <ul> <li><strong>The two main opposition parties in the Lords have both signalled their intention to amend the article 50 bill. </strong>In her speech <strong>Angela Smith</strong>, the Labour leader, insisted that this was perfectly legitimate and that it did not amount to blocking the bill.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As evidenced from the amendments already tabled we will seek improvements, encourage ministers to make reasonable changes, and possibly, just possibly, we may ask our colleagues in the Other Place to reconsider on specific issues.</p> <p>That\u2019s not delaying the process, it is part of the process and has no impact on the government\u2019s self-imposed deadline. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Lord Newby,</strong> the Lib Dem leader in the Lords, made a similar point.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We do have the power to ask the Commons to think again on any piece of legislation, large or small. And I hope the government will accept this. When we had the statement in response to the supreme court ruling on 24 January the minister, the Noble Lord, Lord Bridges said \u201cwe in this House, as an unelected chamber, need to tread with considerable care on this issue as we proceed.\u201d </p> <p>The clear implication was that we should not be pressing amendments. In response, Lord Rooker replied \u201cIt would be very useful if when we debate this bill, we do not have ministers or anyone else talking about constitutional crises. This place cannot have the last word. A government defeat in your Lordships\u2019 House is simply a request to the Commons to look at the issue again \u2013 that is all it is.\u201d My Lords that sums up the position perfectly.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Natalie Evans, the leader of the Lords, said she accepted that peers did not want to \u201cfrustrate\u201d Brexit. </strong>Some people have claimed this, she said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As someone who understands our collective sense of responsibility to our important constitutional role I don\u2019t share those concerns. I am confident peers will take a constructive approach in our deliberations.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Smith criticised those in government who have been threatening, through anonymous briefings, to swamp the House of Lords with new peers or to abolish it if peers delay the article 50 bill. </strong>She said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>MPs, even peers from your Lordships House, and an anonymous \u2018government source\u2019 have threatened this House with 600 or 1000 extra Conservative peers to get this legislation through, or with abolition.</p> <p>I did have to point out in response to one Conservative MP, that it would take about two years to introduce 1000 new peers which might be a little too late for this bill.</p> <p>But my Lords, we will not be threatened into not fulfilling our normal constitutional role \u2013 and neither will we be goaded into acting irresponsibly.</p> <p>We have to have a serious and responsible debate. </p> <p>And in doing so, if we ask the House of Commons to look again at an issue, it is not a constitutional outrage but a constitutional responsibility.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She said that those who have doubts about Brexit must not be excluded from the negotiating process.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The motivation to get the best possible deal will be driven by understanding the complexities involved. Not a glib confidence that it\u2019s all going to be fine.</p> <p>The process of Brexit cannot be run solely by those that have no doubt. It has to engage those that fear the worst and will work for the best.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>She criticised Theresa May\u2019s \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d slogan. </strong>She told peers:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>That lack of government planning has created a vacuum in which uncertainty has thrived.</p> <p>\u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d was perhaps the most unwise of all statements following the referendum. It just served to highlight that void.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Newby described the government\u2019s white paper on Brexit as \u201ca rather horrifying mixture of pious aspiration and complacent delusion\u201d.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>With the stark exception of its rejection of the single market and the European Court, the white paper is a rather horrifying mixture of pious aspiration and complacent delusion. The prime minister\u2019s preface sets the tone. British exceptionalism abounds. We have the \u201cfinest intelligence services, the bravest armed forces, the most effective hard and soft power. What\u2019s more, according to the white paper, the country is \u201ccoming together\u201d, with \u201c65 million people willing to make it happen.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said the government\u2019s approach to Brexit was \u201clittle short of disastrous\u201d.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Brexit is the most important single issue which has faced the country for decades. For many of us, the approach being adopted by the government is little short of disastrous. For those of us \u2013 and there are many in your lordships\u2019 House \u2013 for whom Europe has been a central theme of our entire political lives, to sit on our hands in these circumstances is both unthinkable and unconscionable. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-02-21T00:21:40.978Z\">at 12.21am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58ab1364e4b030b6f7c8d599\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-02-20T16:06:56.879Z\">4.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Hague says, given that he cannot have what he wanted (Britain remaining in the EU), the next best thing will be for Britain to leave with as much unity as possible.</p> <p>He says democratic accountability involves the government being able to go to the country in 2020 and ask to be judged on how it handled Brexit.</p> <p>He says he has been involved in many EU negotiations.

The article 50 bill is due to have its final day in the Lords on Tuesday 7 March. By the time it gets its third reading it is likely to contain some anti-government amendments, possibly guaranteeing EU nationals the right to stay in the UK and firming up the commitment for parliament to get a vote on the final deal. But the government will then remove those amendments when the bill returns to the Commons, perhaps on Monday 13 March. The bill will then return to the Lords and peers could then insist on their amendments (ie, vote to put them back in again.)

Here it is.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>False claims and insensitivity regarding Hillsborough by Paul Nuttall and Arron Banks force honourable resignations.</strong></p> <p>In a major blow to Paul Nuttall and Ukip, two leading figures in Paul Nuttall\u2019s home patch of Liverpool, namely the branch chairman of Nuttall\u2019s branch, <strong>Stuart Monkcom,</strong> and the chairman of Ukip for the Merseyside region of branches, <strong>Adam Heatherington, </strong>have resigned from their positions and left the party citing the unprofessional handling of information surrounding Hillsborough by Paul Nuttall and the insensitive remarks made by Arron Banks reported in national press.</p> <p>\u201cAlthough the timing of our resignations is unfortunate in light of upcoming elections, both Adam and I wish to make it clear, where the painful subject of Hillsborough is concerned, with closure not yet in sight, this unprofessional approach and crass insensitivity from high profile people closely within and without Ukip is upsetting and intolerable. We identify most strongly with all the good people of Liverpool and most importantly the families of the Hillsborough victims who have fought so hard and long for justice, in their condemnation of the way Ukip has handled these issues and have resigned our positions and membership of Ukip forthwith,\u201d says Stuart, branch chairman of Paul Nuttall\u2019s own branch, Ukip Liverpool.<br></p> <p>Adam continues: \u201cWe have been affected both personally and professionally by words that were not said in our name. With this in mind, we wish to apologise to the people of Liverpool and the Hillsborough families for any offence caused and have done what we consider to be the only honourable thing we could do which was to resign and disassociate ourselves from Ukip. I felt that supporting a libertarian party was the right thing to do in order to effect change within the political system in this country. Unfortunately that dream has been shattered and the potential of Ukip has been squandered by people who have demonstrated they are not fit to lead at present.\u201d</p> <p>A press spokesman for the pair noted: \u201cIt is impossible for those hard working party activists at grass roots level who are never properly briefed, not to be affected by the actions of those in control of the party machinery when mistakes and poor policy decisions are made. They are the ones who are most affected in the fallout. However, they have shown personal integrity by responding to genuine criticism which it appears Ukip cannot bring itself to comment upon in a timely manner.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>And here are the key points.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Outgoing Ukip Liverpool chairman Stuart Monkcom accuses Paul Nuttall of \u201ccrass insensitivity\u201d over Hillsborough.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Outgoing Ukip Merseyside chairman Adam Heatherington says Nuttall is \u201cnot fit to lead\u201d.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Monkcom and Heatherington apologise to the people of Liverpool and the Hillsborough families for Nuttall on behalf of Ukip.</strong></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9cd421cf14a49f48f2a7ce8cb2cdcec70340e74e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9cd421cf14a49f48f2a7ce8cb2cdcec70340e74e/0_0_1296_1296/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adam Heatherington, who has resigned as Ukip\u2019s Merseyside chairman.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adam Heatherington, who has resigned as Ukip\u2019s Merseyside chairman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ukip/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-02-20T13:10:34.667Z\">at 1.10pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58aab38de4b0fcbf4e7d7848\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-02-20T09:18:23.045Z\">9.18am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Paul Nuttall,</strong> the Ukip leader, has just put out a press statement.

I urge pro-EU peers not to go down this perilous path.</p> <p>In the last great constitutional crisis David Lloyd-George called the Lords \u2018Mr Balfour\u2019s Poodle\u2019 and referred to peers as 500 men drawn from the ranks of the unemployed.</p> <p>I note the relevant figure is now 900 men and women, which does not look like progress to me.

          "bodyText": "Sir Alan Duncan, the deputy foreign secretary, has reaffirmed the government\u2019s intention to host President Trump on a state visit at the end of a three-hour debate that saw MPs denounce him as unworthy of the honour. The debate, which took place in Westminster Hall, was prompted by the petition signed by 1.8m people saying Trump should be denied a state visit and it was opened by the Labour MP Paul Flynn who, in a wide-ranging attack, described Trump\u2019s intellect as \u201cprotozoan\u201d. (See 4.42pm.) MPs divided almost entirely along party lines, with Conservative MPs defending the decision to invite Trump (if not defending his policies), but opposition MPs criticising Trump much more aggressively, and arguing that the honour of a state visit was unmerited. But, wrapping up for government, Duncan said that state visits were the government\u2019s \u201cmost important diplomatic tool\u201d and he made it clear that the government expected the invitation to boost Britain\u2019s diplomatic interests. He told MPs: A state visit is a uniquely British construct. No other country is able to offer a state visit in quite the same way as we do. It is distinctively British. And over the course of her reign Her Majesty has hosted over 100 of them. All such visits are a rare and prestigious occasion. But they are also our most important diplomatic tool. They enable us to strengthen and influence those international relationships that are of the greatest strategic importance to this country. The debate ended without MPs voting on whether the visit should go ahead and the debate will have no impact on the government\u2019s plans. But, alongside the parallel Stop Trump protests taking place in Parliament Square and in other British cities this evening, it illustrated just how much opposition Trump will face when he arrives on British soil. Duncan ended his speech saying he hoped Trump would get a \u201cpolite and generous\u201d welcome. (See 7.20pm.) Tonight that sounded optimistic, to put it mildly. Theresa May took the highly unusual decision to watch the House of Lords begin debating the bill to start the process of leaving the EU, as her most senior minister in the upper chamber warned peers not to try to alter the terms of Brexit. As Rowena Mason reports, the prime minister sat on the steps of the throne in the Lords for the opening of the debate, which is considering the Brexit bill to give the prime minister the power to trigger article 50. MPs are not allowed to sit on the main benches of the Lords but May is permitted to watch proceedings from the steps of the throne as a privy counsellor. In practice, this rarely happens. The rule book states that the steps in front of the throne, where the monarch sits when delivering the Queen\u2019s speech, are allowed to be occupied by observers. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. Thanks for the comments. Stop Trump has been tweeting and retweeting pictures on its Twitter feed of some of the various anti-Trump protests taking place this afternoon. MPs cannot hold a debate without having a motion to debate. And when they are not debating a substantive proposition, they debate a technical motion, such as that this House do not adjourn, or that this House has considered the matter of X, Y or Z. At the end of this debate Andrew Turner, the chair, put the motion that this House has considered the two Trump petitions to a vote by acclamation. Some MPs shouted aye, but many more shouted no - effectively registering a symbolic protest about Trump\u2019s visit. But there was not a proper division, and their voting down the motion by acclamation does not carry any weight. I\u2019ll post a summary shortly. The Labour MP Paul Flynn is winding up the debate now. He says this debate has enabled parliament to represent the views of the people. MPs have shown that they are responding to the anger people feel about Trump\u2019s visit, he says. He says it is a good day for parliament. Duncan says the visit should happen and will happen. And, when it does, he trusts that Britain will extend a \u201cpolite and generous\u201d welcome to the American president. Sir Alan Duncan, the deputy foreign secretary, is winding up now. He is responding to the debate on behalf of the government. He says state visits are uniquely British events. They are also important weapons in the diplomatic armoury. He says the relationship with the US is based around a common language and common interests. It is a special relationship. We believe we should use all the tools at our disposal to build common ground with President Trump. He says the relationship with the US transcends political parties. And it is bigger than personalities, he says. He says Theresa May\u2019s visit to Washington identified many areas of common interest. And the state visit will allow these to be deepened, he says. Labour\u2019s Seema Malhotra says giving Trump a state visit will be seen as an endorsement of Trump\u2019s policy. Duncan says he understands this point. He will address it. President George W Bush and President Obama both got a state visit in their first term of office. So it is appropriate that Trump should get one too. He says the issue of whether or not Trump addresses parliament is premature. Trump has not asked to give a speech in parliament, and the issue has not even been discussed, he says. West says offering Trump a state visit at this point was \u201can error of judgment\u201d. If the visit does go ahead, Trump should not be invited to give a speech in Westminster Hall, she says. She says she supports what John Bercow, the Commons speaker, said about this. (Two weeks ago Bercow said he would block Trump being allowed to give a speech in Westminster Hall.) The Labour MP Catherine West, a shadow Foreign Office minister, is winding up now for the opposition. She says going ahead with a state visit, while Trump is still proceeding with his travel ban, would send the wrong message to the White House. He says there are citizens of the countries affected by the travel ban living in MPs\u2019 constituencies. She says she thinks it would be a good idea for a Commons committee to review the approach taken to state visits. That might protect Theresa May from what happened this time, when a state visit was offered only for Trump to take London by surprise with his announcement of the travel ban. The SNP MP Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh says that Trump posted a tweet in 2012 saying it would be acceptable taking nude photographs of the Duchess of Cambridge. Any family would not want to welcome someone into their home after a remark like that, she says. So why should the royal family have to put up with him? The Labour MP Liam Byrne says he is a great supporter of America. He was a Fulbright scholar, and spent two years in the country. He says he admires America for its qualities like generosity. But Trump does not reflect those values. This week it is Washington Day, marking George Washington\u2019s birthday. It was said Washington could not tell a lie. With Trump, it is as if he cannot tell the truth, Byrne says. He says he fears that, if Trump\u2019s visit goes ahead, it will be divisive. The protests will make today\u2019s demonstration look like a tea party. And people in America will see the demonstrations and think that they say something about that Britons think of America, not what they think about Trump. He accepts it is probably too late to withdraw the offer of a state visit now. But if the visit must go ahead, it should be short, he says. It certainly won\u2019t be sweet. The Labour MP Dawn Butler says she represents Brent Central in London, one of the most diverse constituencies in Europe. She says it is often said that when America sneezes, Europe catches a cold. But now the US has a \u201cpretty nasty virus\u201d, she says. She says people are protesting outside Westminster because they feel so strong about Trump. According to the SNP MP Patrick Grady, the demonstration can be heard in Westminster Hall, where the debate is taking place. The Lib Dem MP Alistair Carmichael, the former Scottish secretary, says he thinks Theresa May got it \u201ccatastrophically wrong\u201d offering President Trump a state visit on her first trip to Washington. If we are offering Trump a state visit now, what will we offer him next when we need a favour? The crown jewels? Carmichael says he thinks May was spooked by pictures of Nigel Farage, the former Ukip leader, getting to visit Trump in Trump Tower before any other British politician. The MP chairing the proceedings has just cut the time limit for speeches down to four minutes. The Financial Times\u2019 Jim Pickard has spotted this rather odd placard at the anti-Trump protest outside the Commons. The Labour MP Daniel Zeichner, who represents Cambridge, says 9,000 people in his constituency have signed the petition saying Trump should not get a state visit. That is about one in 10 of his constituents, he says. He says MPs must respond to concerns expressed on this scale. Cambridge is an outward-looking, tolerant place, he says. He says Trump\u2019s values are quite different. He says the invitation for a state visit should be withdrawn. I have beefed up some of the earlier posts now with direct quotes from the Press Association\u2019s report of the debate. But, to get those to show up, you may need to refresh the page. Main says comments like Paul Flynn\u2019s earlier about President Trump having a \u201cprotozoan\u201d intellect (see 4.42pm) are hugely disrespectful to an ally. The Conservative MP Anne Main is speaking now. She says she does not know what the Queen thinks about the visit, but she assumes that the invitation was offered with the Queen\u2019s consent. Main may not know what the Queen thinks about this all, but Private Eye, the British satirical magazine, has had a good guess. The Labour MP Tulip Siddiq is speaking now. She says she is the daughter of an asylum seeker, was brought up in a Muslim household and is a woman with strong views. She is not President Trump\u2019s sort of person, she says. She says the issue is about whether or not Trump deserves a royal visit. MPs have to listen to their constituents who are saying he is not entitled to this honour, she says. Sir Edward Leigh, a Conservative, says he does not think the travel ban is racist. Indonesia is the country with the biggest Muslim population in the world, but it is not covered, he says. He says Trump was elected president. Our interests depend on trying to influence this man, and tying him to our point of view, he says. He says Trump would never be elected in this country. But he was elected in the US, we have to work with him, and cancelling the state visit would be a \u201cdisaster\u201d. Here is the Press Association report of the anti-Trump demonstration outside the Houses of Parliament. Hundreds of protesters gathered outside Parliament as MPs began debating Donald Trump\u2019s state visit to Britain. In a packed Westminster Hall, MPs were considering Theresa May\u2019s decision to extend the invitation to the US president in a debate being held in response to petitions signed by millions of Britons. Anti-Trump chants were heard from Parliament Square before the debate, and appeared to die down as Labour MP Paul Flynn opened proceedings. MPs were debating a petition signed by more than 1.85 million people, calling for the visit to be stripped of the trappings of a state occasion in order to avoid causing \u201cembarrassment\u201d to the Queen ... The Stop Trump coalition has called a nationwide day of action and dozens of protests have been co-ordinated by the One Day Without Us movement celebrating the contribution of immigrants to British society. The rally in Parliament Square, which organisers claimed will attract more than 20,000 people, will be addressed by speakers including joint Green Party leader Caroline Lucas and comic Shappi Khorsandi. Celebrities backing the action include singer Paloma Faith, who said: \u201cI\u2019m backing the protests because I believe in human rights and compassion and Trump evidently does not.\u201d Calls for the state visit to be cancelled have been backed by London mayor Sadiq Khan, who hit out at the president\u2019s \u201ccruel and shameful\u201d policies. Khan said the controversial tycoon\u2019s travel ban aimed at people from seven Muslim-majority countries, which has run into trouble in the US courts, and the suspension of refugee admissions were reasons not to be \u201crolling out the red carpet\u201d. Jon Sopel, the BBC\u2019s North America editor, says coverage of this debate in America is wrongly suggesting that there is a possibility of the state visit being withdrawn. FAKE NEWS, as the man himself would say on Twitter. As I explained earlier, that is not the case. (See 4.32pm.) Blunt says the state visit offer should not be withdrawn. But there is no need for it to go ahead this year, he says. He says a better time would be in 2020, which will be the 400th anniversary of the Pilgrim Fathers, he says. Crispin Blunt, the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons foreign affairs committee, says that withdrawing the invitation to a state visit would put the Queen in an embarrassing position. He says he thinks that Theresa May used the offer of a state visit to enable her to become the first foreign leader to visit President Trump in the White House. During that visit she got Trump to confirm his backing for Nato, he says. The SNP\u2019s Joanna Cherry asks Blunt who told him that May used the state visit offer to secure her invitation to the White House. Blunt says he has not been told that this is what happened. But he is making that assumption based on his knowledge of how these matters work. (Blunt used to be a special adviser in the Foreign Office.) Alex Salmond, the SNP MP and former Scottish first minister, says it is a mistake to think that Trump will do anything for the UK as a favour. He will only do what is in his interests, Salmond says. Blunt says Trump can be made to change his mind. He says he was assured by contacts that Trump was going to remove protections for LGBT people. But that did not happen, he says. Naz Shah, the Labour MP for Bradford West, who is Muslim, says she needs to represent the views of her many constituents who are opposed to President Trump because of his stance on Muslims. She says people have argued that the Chinese president received a state visit despite China\u2019s human rights record. But people in the UK do not look to China as a beacon for human rights. People do think of the US and the UK as having shared values, she says. Yet President Trump does not support those values, she says. She says, as a Muslim, she is not a threat to Western democracy. But Trump implies that Muslims are the enemy, she says. That is me as a Muslim in this House. I am not an enemy to Western democracy, I am part of Western democracy. I fought my election really hard, I fought against all those things - the bigotry, the sexism, the patriarchy - to earn my place in this House. By allowing Donald Trump a state visit and bringing out the crockery, the china, the red carpet, what we are doing is endorsing all those views, all those things that I fought hard against, and saying \u2018you know what, it\u2019s OK\u2019. She says he should not be honoured with a state visit. Sir Simon Burns, a Conservative former minister, tells MPs that he is a strong opponent of Trump\u2019s. He is an American politics enthusiast, and a passionate Democrat, and he actively supported Hilary Clinton. But he thinks the government has to decide what is in the national interest. Having a good relationship with Washington is essential, he says. What we have got to do is look at what is going to be most helpful for Britain, for its future policy and development, and I think it is a no brainer that working closer with the United States is far more important for this country, particularly as we begin negotiations and the exit from the EU in two, two and a half years\u2019 time. We cannot afford to be isolated and to ignore our friends. The Stop Trump coalition, which is organising protests for when President Trump visits the UK, has been holding a demonstration outside parliament this afternoon. Here are some pictures from the protest. The Labour MP Stephen Doughty says what worries him most about President Trump are his attacks on the US constitution. The Conservative MP James Cartlidge is speaking now. He says MPs are debating a foreign policy issue. And they should be calmly considering what is in the country\u2019s best interests. If we have concerns about Trump\u2019s policies, we should raise them with him, Cartlidge. He says the offer of a state visit cannot be withdrawn now. He says, if the offer were withdrawn now, the person who would be most happy would be Vladimir Putin, because the Russian president wants to divide the west. He says he would favour offering Putin a state visit. Putin might do terrible things. But the important thing for the UK is to exert as much influence as possible, he says. I\u2019ll tell you who will win [if the invitation is withdrawn]- there\u2019s one man, and that\u2019s Vladimir Putin. There will be smiles all round in the Kremlin if we follow this petition because the one thing they want in the Kremlin above all else is to divide the West. They want the UK and US divided, they do not want a strong transatlantic partnership - that\u2019s not just in our interests but in the global interest. We would be crackers to do so. Indeed, having said all that, I would offer a state visit to Vladimir Putin - as was done by Tony Blair. Cartlidge says withdrawing the state visit would make the UK \u201ca laughing stock\u201d. Alex Salmond, the SNP MP and former Scottish first minister, goes next. He criticises Theresa May\u2019s \u201cfawning\u201d approach to Trump when she went to visit him in Washington. It is difficult to know whether to be appalled at the morality or astonished at the stupidity of the invitation. As an example of fawning subservience Theresa May\u2019s holding hands across the ocean visit would be difficult to match. To do it in the name of shared values was stomach churning. Which are the shared values that president Trump has been exemplifying in his first thirty days in office? As an exercise in stupidity the offer of a state visit was beyond compare. Even when people are in a weak negotiating position it is as well not to advertise it so blatantly, and negotiating a trade deal with Donald Trump from a position of weakness is a recipe for disaster. Justin Trudeau like Theresa May is a new prime minister. Yet he has demonstrated how to pursue a business relationship while keeping Canada\u2019s integrity intact. Mrs May should take note and rescind the state visit forthwith before any further embarrassment and division is caused. Referring to reports saying Trump does not want to meet Prince Charles during the state visit, in case the prince brings up climate change, Salmond says Trump must be the first person invited on a state visit who tries to pick which royals he will meet. He says he dealt with Trump when he was Scotland\u2019s first minister and he knows that offering Trump a state visit from a position of weakness will be \u201ca disaster\u201d. From my experience of negotiating with Donald Trump, let me tell the honourable member, never ever do it from a weak position because the result will be total disaster. He says the offer should be rescinded. Julian Lewis, the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons defence committee, is speaking now. He asks MPs to consider the possibility that inviting President Trump to the UK could get him to firm up his support for Nato. If that were the case, what is more important, he asks: condemning him, or doing what Theresa May did, and reaching out to Trump in the hope of winning him over and getting him to reaffirm his support for Nato. If you knew that it\u2019d make a significant difference to bringing him on side to continue with the policies that prevented a conflagration on that scale, do you really think it is more important to berate him, castigate him and encourage him to retreat into some sort of bunker rather than to do what the prime minister did, perhaps more literally than any of us expected, which is to take him by the hand and try and lead him down the paths of righteousness? Because I have no doubt at all about this matter. What really matters to the future of Europe is that transatlantic alliance continues and should prosper. There\u2019s every prospect of that happening providing we reach out to this inexperienced individual and try and persuade him - and there\u2019s every chance of persuading him that he should continue with the policy pursued by his predecessors. The Liberal Democrat MP Alistair Carmichael asks Lewis what evidence he has that the state visit will have this impact. Just this weekend Trump cast doubt on his support for Nato, Carmichael says. Lewis says Trump is right about wanting Nato countries to contribute more to defence. If Trump\u2019s threat to withdraw support for countries that do not pay their full contribution to Nato is what it takes to get them to pay up, then he may go down as the person who saved Nato, he says. David Lammy, the Labour MP and former minister, goes next. He says he loves the United States. He studied there, and has visited the country more often than France, he says. An official visit may have been appropriate, he says. But to offer President Trump a state visit after just seven days in office was wrong, he says. He says Trump has has the support of the Ku Klux Klan. He thinks of his children, and how to explain to them that someone who talks of grabbing pussy gets a state visit. And presidents like Kennedy did not get a state visit, he says. So why should Trump? There are many African Americans in American sitting at home in fear, they are concerned about the president who has had the support of the Ku Klux Klan. They are concerned about the president that has welcomed white supremacists - it\u2019s a term we hoped would almost fall into history - into his close inner circle. That Britain should abandon all its principles and afford this man a state visit after seven days - really? Why? Because this great country is so desperate for a trade deal that we would throw all of our own history out of the window? We didn\u2019t do this for Kennedy, we didn\u2019t do this for Truman, we didn\u2019t do this for Reagan, but for this man, after seven days, we say please come and we will lay on everything because we are so desperate for your company. I think this country is greater than that. I think my children deserve better than that. I think my daughter deserves better than that. I\u2019m ashamed frankly that it has come to this. He says Trump has put people in fear. He should not get a state visit, Lammy says. UPDATE: Lammy has tweeted this. Nigel Evans, a rightwing Conservative, is speaking now. He says the experts did not expect Donald Trump to be elected. We have to ask ourselves why is it that people felt so left behind that they made the democratic decisions that they have which we think we can\u2019t understand - how could you possibly vote for Brexit? How could you possibly vote for Donald Trump? The fact is that the people have. These were the forgotten people. Just like we had the forgotten people in the United Kingdom, there are the forgotten people in the United States of America. But Trump won, Evans says, and he is delivering on his promises. He may be the only politician to do this, he says. He is going to go down in history as being roundly condemned as the only politician to deliver on his promises. Evans says he does not support all Trump\u2019s policies. But he says he has seen no evidence that Trump is racist. And he says, if MPs attack Trump, they are attacking the 60-odd million Americans who voted for him. He says the trolling of Melania Trump (Trump\u2019s wife) and Barron Trump (his son) on social media have been appalling. Flynn quotes from a column on the state visit by the Observer\u2019s Andrew Rawnsley. Rawnsley wrote: Some ministers mutter that the big mistake was to issue the invitation to make an early state visit to Britain, a notion conceived as a way of flattering his colossal vanities. At the very least, it would have been prudent to wait before rolling the royal red carpet. Pimping out the Queen for Donald Trump. This, apparently, is what they meant by getting our sovereignty back. Flynn ends by saying that, if Trump gets a state visit, it will look as if Britain is endorsing his policies. We are in a position unlike any faced by any previous Parliament where we have a person of a unique personality running the United States. There are great dangers in attempts to give him the best accolade we can offer anyone - only been offered twice before - of a state visit. This would be terribly wrong because it would appear that the British Parliament, the British nation, the British sovereign, is approving of the acts of Donald J Trump. Flynn says Trump is the least popular American president in the UK ever. And in the US his ratings are going down, he says. He says Trump is now as unpopular as Nixon was at the time of Watergate. He says MPs should respond to the petition on Trump because, if they do not respond to the public will on an issue like this, support for politicians will fall even further. Flynn, a leftwinger and a republican, says he has enormous regard for the Queen. She continues to work even though she is eight years older than he is, he says. Flynn is 82. Flynn says \u201cthe intellectual capacity of the president is protozoan\u201d. He says President Trump has exacerbated all the problems he has intervened in. Labour MP Paula Sherriff says: To use the expression \u2018Grab them by the pussy\u2019 describes a sexual assault, and therefore suggests he should not be afforded a visit to our Queen. Asked if he agrees that Trump\u2019s talk of grabbing women \u201cby the pussy\u201d makes him unfit to meet the Queen, Flynn says he agrees. Jacob Rees-Mogg, a Conservative and arch traditionalist, says that Trump\u2019s language might have been misfortunate. But Emperor Hirohito of Japan was given a state visit even though he was responsible for the Rape of Nanking. He says: What complaint did you make when Emperor Hirohito came here, who was responsible for the rape of Nanking? Flynn says some guests are more welcome than others. There have been many people here who were less welcome than others. That\u2019s absolutely true. But we\u2019ve had people here, very unsavoury characters and not from the United States as it happens. But certainly we can\u2019t try to imitate the errors of the past. We should set an example of making sure we don\u2019t make those mistakes again. The Labour MP Paul Flynn, a member of the petitions committee, is opening the debate. He says he thinks MPs are agreed in their support for American values. But this debate is about the wisdom of offering President Trump a state visit, he says. He says since 1952 only two other American presidents have been accorded a state visit. Yet President Trump was offered one after just seven days in office, he says. You can watch the Trump debate on the parliamentary website here. This is not the first time MPs have debated whether or not Donald Trump should visit the UK in Westminster Hall. In January last year, when Trump was still just one of many candidates seeking the Republican nomination for president, MPs held a debate on a petition saying he should be banned from the UK because of his proposal to prevent Muslims from entering the US. You can read an account of that debate here. At the time MPs from all parties condemned Trump\u2019s proposal although the general consensus was that, given there was a chance of Trump becoming president, banning him from the UK would probably be unwise. MPs have just started a three-hour debate on refusing Donald Trump a state visit to the UK. It is technically a House of Commons debate, but it is not taking part in the main Commons chamber. Instead it is being held in Westminster Hall, a mini chamber, or annex, off the historic Westminster Hall (same name, but different room) that gets used for low-level debates that do not involve legislation or votes. Today\u2019s debate is taking place because the Commons has a rule that says petitions that attract more than 100,000 signatures should normally be considered for debate. The main petition about Trump has been signed by 1.8m people. It says: Donald Trump should be allowed to enter the UK in his capacity as head of the US Government, but he should not be invited to make an official State Visit because it would cause embarrassment to Her Majesty the Queen. But MPs will also be debating a rival petition saying Trump should get a state visit. It has been signed by 312,000 people and it says: Donald Trump should be invited to make an official State Visit because he is the leader of a free world and U.K. is a country that supports free speech and does not believe that people that appose our point of view should be gagged. The debate will be opened by the Labour MP Paul Flynn, a member of the Commons petitions committee, which decides which petitions get debated. At some point Sir Alan Duncan, the deputy foreign secretary, will respond on behalf of the government. In some respects the whole affair will be quite pointless. MPs will not vote at the end of the debate and, besides, the government has already declared in its response to the petition that the state visit is going ahead. But the debate will allow parliamentarians to tell each other, and the world, quite what they think about the new US president. It won\u2019t be dull. The opening of the Lords debate on the article 50 bill has been rather understated. Natalie Evans, the newish and young (she is 41) leader of the Lords kicked off, but her speech was perfunctory. Angela Smith, her Labour opposite number, and Lord Newby, the Lib Dem leader in the Lords, were much better. Here are the key points. The two main opposition parties in the Lords have both signalled their intention to amend the article 50 bill. In her speech Angela Smith, the Labour leader, insisted that this was perfectly legitimate and that it did not amount to blocking the bill. As evidenced from the amendments already tabled we will seek improvements, encourage ministers to make reasonable changes, and possibly, just possibly, we may ask our colleagues in the Other Place to reconsider on specific issues. That\u2019s not delaying the process, it is part of the process and has no impact on the government\u2019s self-imposed deadline. Lord Newby, the Lib Dem leader in the Lords, made a similar point. We do have the power to ask the Commons to think again on any piece of legislation, large or small. And I hope the government will accept this. When we had the statement in response to the supreme court ruling on 24 January the minister, the Noble Lord, Lord Bridges said \u201cwe in this House, as an unelected chamber, need to tread with considerable care on this issue as we proceed.\u201d The clear implication was that we should not be pressing amendments. In response, Lord Rooker replied \u201cIt would be very useful if when we debate this bill, we do not have ministers or anyone else talking about constitutional crises. This place cannot have the last word. A government defeat in your Lordships\u2019 House is simply a request to the Commons to look at the issue again \u2013 that is all it is.\u201d My Lords that sums up the position perfectly. Natalie Evans, the leader of the Lords, said she accepted that peers did not want to \u201cfrustrate\u201d Brexit. Some people have claimed this, she said: As someone who understands our collective sense of responsibility to our important constitutional role I don\u2019t share those concerns. I am confident peers will take a constructive approach in our deliberations. Smith criticised those in government who have been threatening, through anonymous briefings, to swamp the House of Lords with new peers or to abolish it if peers delay the article 50 bill. She said: MPs, even peers from your Lordships House, and an anonymous \u2018government source\u2019 have threatened this House with 600 or 1000 extra Conservative peers to get this legislation through, or with abolition. I did have to point out in response to one Conservative MP, that it would take about two years to introduce 1000 new peers which might be a little too late for this bill. But my Lords, we will not be threatened into not fulfilling our normal constitutional role \u2013 and neither will we be goaded into acting irresponsibly. We have to have a serious and responsible debate. And in doing so, if we ask the House of Commons to look again at an issue, it is not a constitutional outrage but a constitutional responsibility. She said that those who have doubts about Brexit must not be excluded from the negotiating process. The motivation to get the best possible deal will be driven by understanding the complexities involved. Not a glib confidence that it\u2019s all going to be fine. The process of Brexit cannot be run solely by those that have no doubt. It has to engage those that fear the worst and will work for the best. She criticised Theresa May\u2019s \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d slogan. She told peers: That lack of government planning has created a vacuum in which uncertainty has thrived. \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d was perhaps the most unwise of all statements following the referendum. It just served to highlight that void. Newby described the government\u2019s white paper on Brexit as \u201ca rather horrifying mixture of pious aspiration and complacent delusion\u201d. With the stark exception of its rejection of the single market and the European Court, the white paper is a rather horrifying mixture of pious aspiration and complacent delusion. The prime minister\u2019s preface sets the tone. British exceptionalism abounds. We have the \u201cfinest intelligence services, the bravest armed forces, the most effective hard and soft power. What\u2019s more, according to the white paper, the country is \u201ccoming together\u201d, with \u201c65 million people willing to make it happen.\u201d He said the government\u2019s approach to Brexit was \u201clittle short of disastrous\u201d. Brexit is the most important single issue which has faced the country for decades. For many of us, the approach being adopted by the government is little short of disastrous. For those of us \u2013 and there are many in your lordships\u2019 House \u2013 for whom Europe has been a central theme of our entire political lives, to sit on our hands in these circumstances is both unthinkable and unconscionable. Hague says, given that he cannot have what he wanted (Britain remaining in the EU), the next best thing will be for Britain to leave with as much unity as possible. He says democratic accountability involves the government being able to go to the country in 2020 and ask to be judged on how it handled Brexit. He says he has been involved in many EU negotiations. Anyone involved in talks like those will want to involved being constrained by legislation, he says. He says this bill is admirably simple. Any amendments relating to process might interfere with this, he says. And any amendments relating to policy might undermine the government\u2019s negotiating position, he says. William Hague, the Conservative former foreign secretary, is speaking now. He starts by declaring his interests, and says he is paid to give speeches - for a lot longer than six minutes, the unofficial limit that has been placed on speeches now in the Lords. He says that he voted to stay in the EU. But he thinks it would be a mistake to ignore the view the public expressed in the referendum. He says he has enormous respect for Tony Blair, more than many people in Blair\u2019s own party, but he thinks Blair was wrong to urge people to rise up against Brexit. He says he respects Blair not least because Blair beat him handsomely in the 2001 election. But if a few months later he had urged people to rise up against the result of that election, Blair would have told him to respect it, he says. The Rt Rev Christopher Chessun, the Bishop of Southwark, is speaking now. He says many parts of the country that have benefited most from EU funding voted decisively, \u201cif quixotically\u201d, to leave the EU. He says it is the view of many bishops, including the archbishop of Canterbury, that it would be best not to add amendments to the bill. Where faced with a choice between passing an amendment, and accepting an assurance from a minister, peers should accept the assurances from the government, he says. Lord Hope of Craighead is speaking now. A former judge, he is convenor of the crossbench peers. He says the bill should not be used to tie the government\u2019s hands before the Brexit negotiations start. In his speech Newby says some people have said the House of Lords should not try to amend the bill. But defeating the government on amendment just amounts to asking the government to think again, he says. Theresa May has left the Lords chamber, according to the BBC\u2019s Esther Webber. Lord Newby, the Lib Dem leader in the Lords, is speaking now. He says the government has chosen not to prioritise the economy in the Brexit negotiations. And he criticises the government for trying to align with the UK with the US, not the EU. He says, with Donald Trump as president, we cannot pretend that American and British values are the same. He also describes the government\u2019s white paper on Brexit as a combination of \u201cpious aspiration and complacent delusion\u201d. Smith says the Brexit process must not exclude people who have doubts about the process. Smith says peers have had lots of advice about how they should vote. But they have also received threats from people who should know better, she says. She says government sources have told the papers that they may flood the Lords with new peers if the Lords tries to hold up the article 50 bill. She says she had to point out to one colleague that it would take two years to introduce 1,000 new peers into the Lords, as one story suggested. (Under Lords rules there is a limit to how many new peers can be introduced on any one day.) That would be too long for article 50, she says. She says threatening the Lords is wrong. The Lords will not hold up the bill, she says. But it will scrutinise the bill, and it may ask the government to consider changes to the bill. That is not delaying the process, she says. It is the process. Angela Smith, the Labour leader in the Lords, is speaking now. She says the referendum gave a clear result in favour of leaving the EU. She says a recent report identified 1957 as the happiest year of the last century. It was a time of low wages and poor housing. But it was a time of optimism too, she says. She says that is not the case today. Millennials have much to worry about, she says. She says founding the EU reflected that 1950s optimism. We should not forget the contribution it has made to peace, she says. Here is Lady Royall, who was leader of the Lords when Gordon Brown was prime minister, on Theresa May\u2019s decision to attend the debate. This is from the Daily Mirror\u2019s Dan Bloom. Evans says leaving the EU is a process that will last years. She says peers will have many opportunities to consider the details of this, including when the great repeal bill goes through parliament. She says the government will give parliament as much information as it can about the Brexit negotiation process, so long as that does not undermine the government\u2019s negotiating position. And she confirms that the Commons and the Lords will get a vote on the final deal. The government wants that to happen before the European parliament votes on it, she says. Natalie Evans, the leader of the Lords, is opening the debate. She says this bill is not about reopening the debate about leaving the European Union. The people settled that in the referendum, she says. She says it is a short bill that gives the prime minister the authority to trigger article 50 taking the UK out of the EU. Theresa May is in the House of Lords for the article 50 debate, which will start within the next few minutes. MPs who want to listen to a Lords debate are allowed to sit in the chamber, at the steps of the throne. The Sun\u2019s Harry Cole has caught a screengrab. Peers are about to start debating the second reading of the article 50 bill. It will be a two-day debate, and 190 peers have put their names down to speak. But, unless anything very surprising happens, we won\u2019t a proper vote. Peers normally never vote against a bill at second reading and so it is expected that, at some point tomorrow evening, the bill will go through on the nod. There will be votes later, when peers debate amendments, perhaps next week during the two committee stage debates or, more probably, the following week, on Tuesday 7 March, at report and third reading. (In the Lords it is more common for amendments to be pushed to a vote at report stage than at committee stage.) Today\u2019s debate will be opened by Natalie Evans, the leader of the Lords, and she will be followed by Angela Smith, the Labour leader in the Lords. The full list of peers speaking, and the order in which they will appear, is here. Here is the ICM account of today\u2019s polling. And here are the tables (pdf). The Guardian/ICM poll also featured questions on Donald Trump, John Bercow and Brexit. This afternoon MPs will debate a petition signed by almost 2m people saying that, while Donald Trump should be free to visit the UK, he should not be honoured with a state visit. We asked about this, and it turns out a majority of Britons agree. Asked about the Trump visit, people were given three options. Trump should be prevented from visiting Britain: 18% Trump should be allowed to visit but not given a full state visit: 37% Trump should be given a full state visit: 32% Don\u2019t know: 12% Majority of Britons (55%) are opposed to Donald Trump getting a full state visit, poll suggests. John Bercow, the Commons speaker, told MPs recently that he would block Trump being invited to give a speech in Westminster Hall, leading to calls from some Tories for Bercow to resign on the grounds that he was showing his bias. We asked about this too, and the public seems divided, with many people not expressing a view. Bercow should stay as speaker because he is doing a good job: 30% Bercow should resign or be removed as speaker because he\u2019s not impartial: 32% Don\u2019t know: 38% A third of Britons think John Bercow should resign or be removed as speaker because he\u2019s not impartial, poll suggests. Finally, we asked about what will be one of the key issues for peers as they debate the article 50 bill: whether the government should guarantee EU nationals living in the UK now that they will be allowed to stay, as Labour and other opposition parties are demanding; or whether it should wait until Britons living in other EU countries should also get their rights guaranteed, as Theresa May is proposing. The government should not give EU nationals living in the UK the right to stay until Britons living in other EU countries get the same right: 42% The government should guarantee the rights of EU nationals now, because it is the right thing to do and may get negotiations off to a good start: 41% Don\u2019t know: 17% Voters prefer May\u2019s policy over the rights of EU nationals to Labour\u2019s by a tiny margin, poll suggests. ICM Unlimited interviewed 2,028 adults aged 18+ online on 17-19 February 2017. Interviews were conducted across the country and the results have been weighted to the profile of all adults. ICM is a member of the British Polling Council and abides by its rules. As we all know, opinion polls are not a 100% reliable guide to election results. But they are still considerably more useful than mass vox pops, looking at Twitter or guesswork, and with that caveat here the results of the latest Guardian/ICM poll. In a nutshell, it is truly dire for Labour. Conservatives: 44% (up 2 points from Guardian/ICM two weeks ago) Labour: 26% (down 1) Ukip: 13% (up 1) Lib Dems: 8% (down 2) Greens: 4% (no change) Conservative lead: 18 points (up 3) According to ICM\u2019s Martin Boon, only three other polls in this series (dating from May 1983, when ICM was Marplan) have given the Tories a higher lead over Labour. Two of those polls were just before the 1983 general election, when Margaret Thatcher crushed Michael Foot, and the other was in June 2008, when Gordon Brown\u2019s premiership was at a low point. At 26%, Labour is just one point above the lowest it has ever reached in this series (25%, which it hit in June 2008 and August 2009). But, at 44%, the Conservatives are some way off the highest they have reached in this series, the 47.5% they reached in May 1983. The poll also featured questions about Donald Trump, John Bercow and Brexit. I will post those shortly. ICM Unlimited interviewed 2,028 adults aged 18+ online on 17-19 February 2017. Interviews were conducted across the country and the results have been weighted to the profile of all adults. ICM is a member of the British Polling Council and abides by its rules. Here\u2019s a video of Theresa May in Stoke this morning. This from from BBC Radio Stoke\u2019s Emma Thomas. Speaking during the visit, May says she hoped that the House of Lords would not hold up the article 50 bill. She said: [The bill] was not amended [in the House of Commons]. I hope that the House of Lords will pay attention to that. Properly there will be debate and scrutiny in the House of Lords, but I don\u2019t want to see anybody holding up up what the British people want, what the people of Stoke-on-Trent voted for last year, which is for us to deliver Brexit, to leave the European Union. According to the Telegraph\u2019s Christopher Hope, May is planning to be in the Lords chamber for the opening of the debate. Here are the main lines from the Number 10 lobby briefing. Number 10 claimed that the business rates revaluation coming into force in April amounted to \u201cthe biggest ever cut in business rates\u201d. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman conceded that, overall, the change was revenue neutral, meaning that overall the Treasury will not gain or lose money. But it was the biggest ever cut in terms of the number of firms affected, he said. What we are talking about is the biggest ever cut in business rates. Seventy three per cent of businesses are going to see their bills either reduced or stay exactly the same. That is an effect that is going to be felt across the country ... 600,000 small businesses will pay no rates at all. That will be the permanent position for those businesses. The spokesman also said that the government was spending \u00a33.6bn on transitional relief for businesses that will have to pay more under the new system. Downing Street rejected claims from some EU countries that Britain is adopting \u201cblackmail and divide\u201d tactics in the Brexit negotiations. Asked if he agreed with this allegation, which features in the Guardian\u2019s splash today, the spokesman replied: Quite simply, no. We have been clear throughout this process that we want to see a deal that works in the best interests of both sides, that is us and all the other member states. We want the EU to prosper. That is in Britain\u2019s best interests, and also the interests of the member states. The spokesman rejected Tony Blair\u2019s call for a rethink on Brexit. The spokesman said that MPs passed the referendum bill by six to one and that, following the result last summer, \u201cthe people have made it very clear that they expect us to leave the EU\u201d. Sir Alan Duncan, the deputy foreign secretary, will speak for the government in the Westminster Hall debate on denying President Trump a state visit later today. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman confirmed that May plans to meet Carlos Tavares, the chief executive of the PSA Group, to discuss Peugeot\u2019s proposals to buy General Motors\u2019 European operation, including Vauxhall, but would not discuss what she will say to him. Max Hill QC is the new independent reviewer of terrorism legislation. Amber Rudd, the home secretary, has announced in a written ministerial statement. He is replacing David Anderson QC who has finished his stint in the post. Rudd said: Mr Hill has been a QC for nine years and has extensive experience both defending and prosecuting complex cases involving terrorism, homicide, violent crime, high value fraud and corporate crime. He successfully prosecuted the 21/7 bombers, and he appeared in the inquest into the 7/7 bombings. He also sits as a Recorder at the Old Bailey. Mr Hill will take up this role from 1 March 2017. He takes over from David Anderson QC, who has served as Independent Reviewer with great distinction since 2011, and to whom I am extremely grateful for the significant contribution he has made. I\u2019m just back from the Number 10 lobby briefing. There wasn\u2019t any dramatic news, but there were some lines of interest, and I will post a summary soon. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman refused to comment on reports that Theresa May is visiting Stoke today. But Labour say she is on the way and, in the hope of creating a similar difficulty for her to the one she faced on her byelection trip to Copeland last week, they have just put out a press release quoting from a leaked email saying the deficit of Stoke-on-Trent\u2019s local hospital trust, whose main site is the Royal Stoke Hospital, will be more than \u00a3100m next year. In the email Paula Clarke, the University Hospitals of North Midlands trust\u2019s chief executive, says: Our financial situation remains extremely challenging and is set to worsen significantly when the additional TSA funding for County Hospital runs out at the end of March 2017. I must be very clear that our deficit is not a County specific problem as there are large operating deficits at both sites. As a Trust the financial gap between our costs and our income will be in excess of \u00a3100m next year, which will be one of the largest in the country. Commenting on the leak Gareth Snell, the Labour candidate in Stoke-on-Trent Central, said: This shocking revelation shows that our local hospital trust is at breaking point. The NHS is in crisis and hospitals are struggling to cope. Under Theresa May, our health services are underfunded, understaffed and close to collapse, and UKIP\u2019s response is to sell it off to the highest bidder. Lord Hill, who was Britain\u2019s European commissioner until he resigned after the referendum last year, was also on the Today programme this morning talking about the article 50 bill. He said it would be a mistake to let parliament have a veto over the final Brexit deal. If you think of this from the point of view of the European side where they are going to have to cobble together the views of 27 different member states \u2026 They have to trust that what the prime minister says, what David Davis says, they can deliver on. So I think the idea that at the end of that process of negotiation a British negotiator says \u2018oh I\u2019m terribly sorry, that deal that I\u2019ve just offered to you and struck with you, I\u2019m afraid that Parliament has just voted on it and changed the terms\u2019, I don\u2019t see how you could negotiate in good faith if we were to proceed on that basis. I\u2019m just off to the Number 10 lobby briefing now. I will post again after 11.30am. This afternoon peers will begin the two-day second reading debate on the article 50 bill. Peers do not normally vote at second reading, so the bill will almost certainly go through tomorrow evening on the nod. On the Today programme this morning Angela Smith, the Labour leader in the Lords, said that although opposition peers would try to amend the bill, they would not delay it from becoming law. She said: All the House of Lords can do is ask the Commons to look at an issue again. I don\u2019t see any extended ping pong on this at all. \u201cPing pong\u201d is the process that takes place when the Commons and the Lords disagree over a bill, and it shuttles to and fro between the two Houses at the end of its passage through parliament until one side backs down. The article 50 bill is due to have its final day in the Lords on Tuesday 7 March. By the time it gets its third reading it is likely to contain some anti-government amendments, possibly guaranteeing EU nationals the right to stay in the UK and firming up the commitment for parliament to get a vote on the final deal. But the government will then remove those amendments when the bill returns to the Commons, perhaps on Monday 13 March. The bill will then return to the Lords and peers could then insist on their amendments (ie, vote to put them back in again.) But Smith\u2019s comments suggest that at this point peers will back down, and accept the bill in the unamended form that the government wants. Here is our story on Smith\u2019s comments. Here is the full statement put out on behalf of Stuart Monkcom and Adam Heatherington, the two Ukip chairmen who have resigned from the party in protest over Paul Nuttall\u2019s \u201cfalse claims and insensitivity regarding Hillsborough\u201d, as they put it. I normally just post direct quotes from press releases, but this one is worth quoting in full, including the headline (their bold, not mine). Here it is. False claims and insensitivity regarding Hillsborough by Paul Nuttall and Arron Banks force honourable resignations. In a major blow to Paul Nuttall and Ukip, two leading figures in Paul Nuttall\u2019s home patch of Liverpool, namely the branch chairman of Nuttall\u2019s branch, Stuart Monkcom, and the chairman of Ukip for the Merseyside region of branches, Adam Heatherington, have resigned from their positions and left the party citing the unprofessional handling of information surrounding Hillsborough by Paul Nuttall and the insensitive remarks made by Arron Banks reported in national press. \u201cAlthough the timing of our resignations is unfortunate in light of upcoming elections, both Adam and I wish to make it clear, where the painful subject of Hillsborough is concerned, with closure not yet in sight, this unprofessional approach and crass insensitivity from high profile people closely within and without Ukip is upsetting and intolerable. We identify most strongly with all the good people of Liverpool and most importantly the families of the Hillsborough victims who have fought so hard and long for justice, in their condemnation of the way Ukip has handled these issues and have resigned our positions and membership of Ukip forthwith,\u201d says Stuart, branch chairman of Paul Nuttall\u2019s own branch, Ukip Liverpool. Adam continues: \u201cWe have been affected both personally and professionally by words that were not said in our name. With this in mind, we wish to apologise to the people of Liverpool and the Hillsborough families for any offence caused and have done what we consider to be the only honourable thing we could do which was to resign and disassociate ourselves from Ukip. I felt that supporting a libertarian party was the right thing to do in order to effect change within the political system in this country. Unfortunately that dream has been shattered and the potential of Ukip has been squandered by people who have demonstrated they are not fit to lead at present.\u201d A press spokesman for the pair noted: \u201cIt is impossible for those hard working party activists at grass roots level who are never properly briefed, not to be affected by the actions of those in control of the party machinery when mistakes and poor policy decisions are made. They are the ones who are most affected in the fallout. However, they have shown personal integrity by responding to genuine criticism which it appears Ukip cannot bring itself to comment upon in a timely manner.\u201d And here are the key points. Outgoing Ukip Liverpool chairman Stuart Monkcom accuses Paul Nuttall of \u201ccrass insensitivity\u201d over Hillsborough. Outgoing Ukip Merseyside chairman Adam Heatherington says Nuttall is \u201cnot fit to lead\u201d. Monkcom and Heatherington apologise to the people of Liverpool and the Hillsborough families for Nuttall on behalf of Ukip. Paul Nuttall, the Ukip leader, has just put out a press statement. But it says nothing about the two Liverpool resignations. It is about what Lord Mandelson said on the Andrew Marr Show yesterday about the need for peers to show more courage opposing Brexit. Nuttall said: The British people have made their choice. For the Lords - which is stuffed with pro-EU timeservers and from which UKIP has been systematically excluded - to mess around with it would be both outrageous and dangerous. We would in my view be in a situation akin to that before the first world war when the Parliament Act was passed to bring the upper house to heel after the Lords interfered with a finance bill. The arrogance of Labour peers such as Lord Mandelson and Lord Hain is breath-taking. Unelected figures who set themselves against the will of the people are being grossly irresponsible. I cannot predict the ferocity of the response we might see if our democracy is subverted in this way. I urge pro-EU peers not to go down this perilous path. In the last great constitutional crisis David Lloyd-George called the Lords \u2018Mr Balfour\u2019s Poodle\u2019 and referred to peers as 500 men drawn from the ranks of the unemployed. I note the relevant figure is now 900 men and women, which does not look like progress to me. The Lords must not now become Peter Mandelson\u2019s Poodle. One Ukip insider said he could understand why Stuart Monkcom and Adam Heatherington may have felt the need to resign because anyone publicly associated with Ukip in Liverpool has been under huge pressure since the controversy about Paul Nuttall\u2019s Hillsborough claims erupted. The insider said: If you are the public face of Ukip in Liverpool, you are under an enormous amount of personal pressure. I have nothing but sympathy for these two guys. The two Ukip chairman who have resigned from the party are Stuart Monkcom, chair of Ukip\u2019s Liverpool branch, and Adam Heatherington, chair of Ukip\u2019s Merseyside branch. According to the Sun, here is Monkcom\u2019s statement. Although the timing of our resignations is unfortunate in light of upcoming elections, both Adam and I wish to make it clear, where the painful subject of Hillsborough is concerned, with closure not yet in sight, this unprofessional approach and crass insensitivity from high profile people closely within and without UKIP is upsetting and intolerable. We identify most strongly with all the good people of Liverpool and most importantly the families of the Hillsborough victims who have fought so hard and long for justice, in their condemnation of the way UKIP has handled these issues and have resigned our positions and our membership forthwith. Paul Nuttall, the Ukip leader, is hoping to get elected to parliament in the Stoke-on-Trent Central byelection on Thursday but, as the BBC\u2019s Norman Smith reports, he has been hit by a serious setback at the worst possible time. Two senior Ukip party members from Merseyside have resigned from the party because of Nuttall\u2019s conduct in relation to Hillsborough, and his admission that the claim that he lost close friends in the tragedy were false. One of them, Ukip\u2019s chairman in Liverpool, has questioned whether Nuttall is fit to lead the party. I will post more on this as further details become available. Here is the agenda for the day. 11am: Number 10 lobby briefing. 3pm: Peers begin the two-day second reading debate on the article 50 bill. 4.30pm: MPs hold a debate in Westminster Hall on the petition saying Donald Trump should not be invited to make a state visit to the UK. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another in the afternoon. You can read all today\u2019s Guardian politics stories here. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on@AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but normally I find it impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer direct questions, although sometimes I miss them or don\u2019t have time. Alternatively you could post a question to me on Twitter.",

So in fact, the piece that really got me thinking was a more modest affair. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/feb/15/dinosaur-embryos-reveal-remarkable-secrets-of-life-and-extinction\">Dental analysis of some rare fossils dinosaur embryos</a> has shown that they may have taken many, many months to hatch from their eggs. This of course has major implications for dinosaur behaviour and ecology and might have been a contributing factor to their extinction (that and the asteroid, obviously). It\u2019s a quiet reminder that understanding the drivers of extinction is just as important as reversing it.</p> <p>Here are a couple of comments we enjoyed on our science coverage this week \u2013 very much showing your ability to cross topics ... <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/93321468\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13576126\" title=\"View Tintenfische\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/13576126\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for Tintenfische\"> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13576126\" title=\"View Tintenfische\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">Tintenfische</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/93321468\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">16 February 2017 6:13pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>That's sensible, resurrect an animal notorious for needing to live on the cold just as global warming kicks in.</p> <p>If you're going to bring anything back from the dead it should be Brian Clough and make him England manager.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/93321409\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/14183449\" title=\"View Antgas\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/14183449\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for Antgas\"> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/14183449\" title=\"View Antgas\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">Antgas</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/93321409\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">16 February 2017 6:11pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>Shouldn't we worry about animals facing extinction today that could be preserved for future generations? ..

So what does it mean? Collett provided some expert analysis that gets to the heart of Trump\u2019s bizarre greeting:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It enables Trump to impose himself on the situation by catching the other person unawares and doing something that they hadn\u2019t anticipated. After all, when they\u2019re shaking hands with the president, who would expect to have their arm almost wrenched out of its socket? It\u2019s noticeable that Trump\u2019s \u201cyank-shake\u201d has a lot in common with his political pronouncements \u2013 they\u2019re erratic, unpredictable and self-serving, and they don\u2019t always conform to the other goals that he\u2019s trying to achieve.</p> </blockquote> <p>What do you make of Trump\u2019s signature move?

Scotland and Manchester disprove the simple geography of it. The issue is about the 'left behind' communities. I live in the Copeland constituency, and have a by-election next week. All candidates are understandably talking about jobs, but only in the context of propping up the flagging (and already heavily subsidised) nuclear industry. None of the candidates have ideas for how to create wealth, how to stimulate local innovative companies, or where the new generation of jobs might come from. At a national level, this is true whether you're in an ex-mining area (like mine) or an ex-pottery area (like Stoke). The key is the 'ex'. It is those communities that have seen the progressive decline and withdrawal of heavy industry that have so comprehensively rejected old Labour's corporatist approach, and aligh that more generally with a perception of a metropolitan, urban elite, and therefore with the EU. It is not surprising that there is such a debate about the role of the service sector (and financial services in particular) in relation to Brexit, so much of which is concentrated in the south-east.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58a6cc50e4b0fcbf4e7d6a48\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/matthew-holmes\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-02-17T12:45:19.399Z\">12.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Our new readers' photography project</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>As part of this weekly blog we like to highlight some of the other ways you can get involved on the site, in addition to commenting below the line. <br></p> <p>Here\u2019s a new project we launched earlier in the week alongside editors on our picture desk, who want to see the results of your photography.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/feb/13/share-your-photos-of-walls-and-barriers-around-the-world\">Share your photos of walls and barriers around the world</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We aim, through the \u201creaders\u2019 picture desk\u201d to showcase some of your best work on set themes, but also to publish advice and feedback from photojournalists and editors here.

A couple of polls we posted gave a reasonable indication that you are forward thinking when it comes to both that tech and equality with your date in settling the bill ... highly scientific and significant, of course. If you\u2019re coming late to this dive in, scroll back and feel free to get in touch with any suggestions. We\u2019d be delighted to hear from you, particularly if you\u2019d like to suggest things you\u2019d like to talk about next time. You can continue to comment or email matthew.holmes@theguardian.com or sarah.marsh@theguadian.com (or see us on Twitter @matthewailin or @sloumarsh Until then, have a nice weekend! This week, extinction has been on my mind, which may seem a little morbid but that\u2019s just the way these past few days have been. Obviously, the headline news this week in science seems to be that a team of Harvard scientists could manage to create hybrid mammoth-elephant embryo within the next couple of years. Now, as a fan of Jasper Fforde\u2019s Thursday Next novels, in which re-engineered mammoths cause havoc during their annual migration, I long to see mammoth herds tramping through the streets. Fears about the cost of future insurance aside, there are obviously many technical and ethical barriers to this becoming a reality. So in fact, the piece that really got me thinking was a more modest affair. Dental analysis of some rare fossils dinosaur embryos has shown that they may have taken many, many months to hatch from their eggs. This of course has major implications for dinosaur behaviour and ecology and might have been a contributing factor to their extinction (that and the asteroid, obviously). It\u2019s a quiet reminder that understanding the drivers of extinction is just as important as reversing it. Here are a couple of comments we enjoyed on our science coverage this week \u2013 very much showing your ability to cross topics ... We rather suspected this might be the case for many of you ... In a comeback bid somewhat more welcome than the intervention of Tony Blair into the Brexit debate, this week there were rumours that a Finnish manufacturer would be bringing back that popular old workhorse, the Nokia 3310. The original version is believed to have sold 126m units, and was discontinued in 2005, when the first iPhone was still a couple of years away. The robustness and utility of the old Nokia model made it tremendously successful. In some families, of course, it has never gone away. My mum has still got one of these old Nokia\u2019s, resolutely refusing to upgrade to anything with a touchscreen since her phone \u201cdoes calls and texts and that is all she needs\u201d. But I do wonder, as fondly as people recall playing Snake on it, how many people in the smartphone saturated-developed world would really be willing to switch back to a model like this. It will be a tough ask \u2013 figures from Gartner this week show that sales of new handsets are dominated by Android, taking over 80% of the market, with iOS in second place at around 20%. BlackBerry\u2019s share has dropped officially to 0.0%, with the Windows Phone making up 0.3% of the market. Simplicity may be a selling point for the reissued Nokia model though. Do you feel nostalgic for owning a phone that didn\u2019t need constant app and operating system software updates, and which had a decent battery life? One last reader on dating before we move on. Take the poll. Picture editor Joanna Ruck talks us through some of her images of the week. The World Press Photo awards were announced this week. The controversial winning image of the murder of the Russian ambassador to Turkey even split the judging panel. The Guardian\u2019s sport photographer Tom Jenkins won the top prize for sports photos with this. Beyonce at the Grammys was always going to be a visual spectacle and she didn\u2019t fail to deliver. Photos of Ivanka Trump \u2018swooning\u2019 over Justin Trudeau went a bit viral this week even if it was just the internet\u2019s imagination More on dating ... Seems fair! How about this? To us it does rather make the whole affair seem like a \u201ctransaction\u201d? Take the poll. Going Dutch seems to be having it in our poll, with a few of you either unsure or presumably thinking \u201cit depends\u201d. The poll is too simple to tell us, unfortunately, but we wonder whether there are any differences based on your gender and orientation? When dates go wrong they can go really wrong. We found this out after asking our readers to talk about their dating disasters this week, resulting in some hilarious and somewhat \u201ctragic\u201d stories you can read here. The project was prompted by the story of singleton Lucy Brown, who was asked for money back by a man she rejected after one date. He wanted a refund for the drinks and dinner he had bought her when she refused to meet up a second time. Have you had a similar experience while dating? What is your approach to splitting the cost? What are your stories of dating gone wrong? Share them with us below the line and vote in our poll! We\u2019re going to change topics again above the line here, but you can join readers discussing Brexit, fact checking and Donald Trump \u2013 as well as important things like what they had for lunch \u2013 in the comments. A point on Trump\u2019s handshake, now. Here\u2019s a story related to the point on Oroville: Writing about the treatment of facts online (as I did this week) is always tricky. One person\u2019s incontrovertible truth is often another\u2019s \u201cfake news\u201d. That was inevitably reflected in some of the responses to my piece, which was about sites presenting themselves as neutral fact checkers despite clear biases. Some commenters attacked the Guardian\u2019s own reporting, though many also defended its integrity. Others questioned whether any fact checker could be unbiased, including some of those known for good practice. Some suggested media organisations should add broader context, others said they should restrict themselves to the bare simple facts with less interpretation. Whatever the opinions, it is especially heartening to see people engage with what is not only a huge issue for journalism and politics, but also one that makes a critical approach to everything you read vital. Guardian commenters, whether they agree with us or not, seem well aware of the importance of assessing sources of information carefully, which can only be a good thing. What would you like to talk about? Don\u2019t be afraid to tell us in the comments. Seven days in Trump-land is befuddling \u2013 a constant stream of stories, all seemingly more confusing than the next. But it was the handshake that captured the imagination earlier this week. This short film, in fact, was one of the most viewed pieces on the Guardian in the last few days: I\u2019d first noticed it at the announcement of his Supreme Court nominee \u2013 the odd forceful pull he engages in, dragging his victim near to those beady eyes, no doubt squeezing as hard as his tiny hands can manage. But it was Justin Trudeau\u2019s ability to resist that focused minds. The Canadian PM had already demonstrated his core strength with his remarkable plank \u2013 but the bicep power to deny the \u201cyank-shake\u201d, as body language expert Peter Collett termed it, is quite something. So what does it mean? Collett provided some expert analysis that gets to the heart of Trump\u2019s bizarre greeting: It enables Trump to impose himself on the situation by catching the other person unawares and doing something that they hadn\u2019t anticipated. After all, when they\u2019re shaking hands with the president, who would expect to have their arm almost wrenched out of its socket? It\u2019s noticeable that Trump\u2019s \u201cyank-shake\u201d has a lot in common with his political pronouncements \u2013 they\u2019re erratic, unpredictable and self-serving, and they don\u2019t always conform to the other goals that he\u2019s trying to achieve. What do you make of Trump\u2019s signature move? What does it tell us about his personality? A last couple of points for now on the Brexit debate which continues below the line following Abi Wilkinson\u2019s earlier post (see here). We\u2019re going to move on and introduce a few other topics up here, but you can continue to debate the issues already raised \u2013 and indeed anything else you think worth talking about \u2013 in the comments. This reader lives in the Copeland constituency, in Cumbria, where a byelection takes place next Thursday. As part of this weekly blog we like to highlight some of the other ways you can get involved on the site, in addition to commenting below the line. Here\u2019s a new project we launched earlier in the week alongside editors on our picture desk, who want to see the results of your photography. We aim, through the \u201creaders\u2019 picture desk\u201d to showcase some of your best work on set themes, but also to publish advice and feedback from photojournalists and editors here. Do take a look \u2013 here are three of my favourite images so far, with different interpretations of the theme \u201cwalls and barriers\u201d: Head of photography Fiona Shields shares some of her wisdom about what makes a great photo in the callout, here. This reader disagrees with the point on PR and makes a point about media coverage. (here\u2019s the piece by Dawn Foster they refer to) A fair point on our headline there in an early comment? And this reader addresses Abi Wilkinson\u2019s points Here\u2019s the comment Abi Wilkinson references in full What do you think? Many of the responses to my column this week \u2013 about the condescending attitude towards leave voters amongs a small (but vocal) minority of affluent, metropolitan remainers \u2013 seemed designed to illustrate my point. Some readers repeated the insults and suggestions that London should stop \u201csending out\u201d money to poorer regions. Not everyone was so negative, though. One post that stood out to me, from reader Oliver Elkington, focused on our FPTP electoral system, suggesting it left \u201cworking-class voters in the North\u2026 angry that their voices were not heard in parliament but instead it was only the voices of the 36% who voted Tory who get a mention.\u201d I\u2019d go a step further and suggest that many people living in safe Labour seats don\u2019t even trust their own MP to advocate for their interests. The party has taken votes from certain demographics for granted in recent decades and people have been left with the feeling that all politicians are the same. For many of those people, the EU referendum felt like a unique opportunity to actually influence something. What do you think? Share your views with us in the comments. It\u2019s that time of the week again \u2013 your chance to discuss the week with fellow readers and Guardian journalists below the line in the comments. Today we will discuss everything from that North-south (or indeed London vs the rest of the country) divide on the issue of Brexit, going Dutch when dating, fact-checking the fact checkers in the age of Donald Trump (in the wake of his extraordinary recent press conference) and even the return of the Nokia 3210. We look forward to hearing your views on all the above and more. Plus \u2013 if there\u2019s anything you want to talk about, whether that stems from a piece you\u2019ve seen in the Guardian or elsewhere, just let us know: we hope the conversation will be driven by you!",

          "bodyText": "The European parliament has passed the controversial EU-Canada free trade deal, while protesters staged a sit-in at the gates of the building in Strasbourg, France. The agreement was celebrated by some as a victory for global free trade in the face of growing US protectionism under the government of Donald Trump. The agreement aims to eliminate 98% of tariffs on exported goods, making it the EU\u2019s most comprehensive trade deal to date. Trade between the two sides amounts to more than 60bn euros (C$83bn) a year, and the EU expects the so-called Ceta deal (Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement) to boost this by 20% by removing almost all tariffs. Supporters claim the pact will be worth \u00a31.3bn (C$2.1bn, $1.6bn) a year to Britain alone, in the period before the UK withdraws from the EU. The EU commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, called it \u201can important milestone\u201d and said \u201cEU companies and citizens will start to reap the benefits the agreement offers as soon as possible\u201d. Guy Verhofstadt, the leader of the ALDE liberal group, said: \u201cPresident Trump has given us another good reason to intensify our links with Canada. While Trump introduces tariffs, we are not only tearing them down but also setting the highest progressive standards.\u201d Also included in the deal, however, are provisions allowing companies greater access to public contracts and sustainable development clauses, prompting some MEPs in the green and socialist political groups in the European parliament to claim it will lead to the wholescale privatisation of the public sector. Unlike classic trade deals, Ceta harmonises regulations on matters such as health and the environment. Protesters attempted to disrupt the vote, with about 700 people marching outside parliament to voice their opposition. Anti-globalisation activists dressed in surgical masks blocked the entrance to the parliament building, before being dragged off by riot police. Despite the concerns, after three hours of debate, MEPs in Strasbourg approved the pact with 408 votes in favour, 254 against and 33 abstentions. \u201cThis is a watershed moment \u2013 EU trade policy will never be the same again,\u201d said the senior Scottish MEP David Martin, whose Socialists and Democrats group split on the issue. Approval by the parliament allows the provisional implementation of Ceta as early as next month, although the Netherlands could conceivably still block the deal if it demands an advisory national referendum. On Thursday, the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, will address MEPs in parliament to celebrate the breakthrough. The leader of the centre-right EPP group in parliament, Manfred Weber, claimed that the agreement stood in stark contrast to the policies of \u201cbuilding walls\u201d endorsed by President Trump. EU states and Canada formally signed the deal in October after seven years of tough negotiation, overcoming last-minute resistance from the Belgian Walloon parliament, which sought to block its national government from approving the accord. Latvian MEP Artis Pabriks, a conservative from the EPP group who sponsored the law, said: \u201cBy adopting Ceta, we chose openness and growth and high standards over protectionism and stagnation.\u201d Some industries are left untouched by the deal, such as audiovisual and transport services and a select few agricultural products, including dairy, which is tightly regulated in Canada. A major flashpoint for opponents is the proposal to set up special courts to settle disputes between investors and national authorities. Opponents believe this provision hands too much power to the corporate giants and their lawyers. \u201cMultinationals will be able to attack governments in a privatised court system,\u201d said France\u2019s far-right presidential candidate and MEP Marine Le Pen, who voted against Ceta. The deal\u2019s EU negotiator, Commissioner Cecilia Malmstroem, told MEPs that \u201cnothing in this agreement undermines a government\u2019s right to regulate in the public interest\u201d. \u2022 This article was amended on 17 February 2017.

One couldn\u2019t help noticing this when he met <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2017/feb/10/donald-trump-shinzo-abe-strong-hands-video\" title=\"\">Shinzo Abe</a>, because during the 19 seconds that they were shaking hands, Trump managed to pat the Japanese prime minister\u2019s hand no less than six times. Patting someone\u2019s hand in this way pretends to be an affectionate gesture of approval, but its real purpose is to remind the other person who\u2019s actually in charge. It\u2019s what psychologists call a \u201cstatus reminder\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/14/mike-flynn-resignation-trumps-nightmare-begun-mar-a-lago\">Mike Flynn might be done \u2013\u00a0but Trump's nightmare has just begun | Richard Wolffe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Another way that Trump reminds people of his superior status is by patting them on the arm or back during or after the handshake, and if the other person is so bold as to pat him back, he trumps them by producing an additional, terminal pat. Trump instinctively understands the rules governing patting \u2013 which are that the more important person reserves the right to pat the less important person, and if mutual patting occurs, has the right to execute the final pat.</p> <p>But the most peculiar thing about Trump\u2019s handshake style is his habit of pushing people away or, more commonly, pulling them towards him during the handshake. The news clips are full of examples of Trump pumping people\u2019s hands and then yanking them towards him. We\u2019ve seen him do this with his colleagues, visiting dignitaries and golfing buddies. There\u2019s even a shot of him yanking Neil Gorsuch\u2019s arm so violently during a handshake that the poor unsuspecting judge momentarily loses his balance.</p> <p>When Trump greeted Justin Trudeau this week, there was every expectation that he\u2019d try to strong-arm the Canadian prime minister. But Trudeau had been well briefed, because as Trump extended his hand, Trudeau stepped right up to him, grabbing his right arm with free left hand. This, and the fact that Trudeau had managed to invade his personal space, made it virtually impossible for Trump to remind Trudeau who was really in charge by giving his hand a good yank.</p> <p>So why does Trump feel the need to physically manoeuvre people like this, and what does it say about his character?</p> <p>There are several possible explanations for Trump\u2019s \u201cyank-shake\u201d. One is that Trump has an irresistible urge to bring people closer to him, to get them on side, and this expresses itself in his habit of pulling people towards him. In support of this explanation it\u2019s worth noting that there are occasions when, having pulled someone towards him, Trump will switch to a more intimate upright handclasp, which of course requires even closer proximity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"41ff489057c8109a2f424cc59d9a10db642fd029\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41ff489057c8109a2f424cc59d9a10db642fd029/0_90_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump and Shinzo Abe\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Trump managed to pat Shinzo Abe\u2019s hand no less than six times.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UPI/Barcroft Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another explanation for the \u201cyank-shake\u201d is that it enables Trump to impose himself on the situation by catching the other person unawares and doing something that they hadn\u2019t anticipated. After all, when they\u2019re shaking hands with the president, who would expect to have their arm almost wrenched out of its socket?

          "bodyText": "When Donald Trump shakes hands he frequently pats the other person on the top of their hand. One couldn\u2019t help noticing this when he met Shinzo Abe, because during the 19 seconds that they were shaking hands, Trump managed to pat the Japanese prime minister\u2019s hand no less than six times. Patting someone\u2019s hand in this way pretends to be an affectionate gesture of approval, but its real purpose is to remind the other person who\u2019s actually in charge. It\u2019s what psychologists call a \u201cstatus reminder\u201d. Another way that Trump reminds people of his superior status is by patting them on the arm or back during or after the handshake, and if the other person is so bold as to pat him back, he trumps them by producing an additional, terminal pat. Trump instinctively understands the rules governing patting \u2013 which are that the more important person reserves the right to pat the less important person, and if mutual patting occurs, has the right to execute the final pat. But the most peculiar thing about Trump\u2019s handshake style is his habit of pushing people away or, more commonly, pulling them towards him during the handshake. The news clips are full of examples of Trump pumping people\u2019s hands and then yanking them towards him. We\u2019ve seen him do this with his colleagues, visiting dignitaries and golfing buddies. There\u2019s even a shot of him yanking Neil Gorsuch\u2019s arm so violently during a handshake that the poor unsuspecting judge momentarily loses his balance. When Trump greeted Justin Trudeau this week, there was every expectation that he\u2019d try to strong-arm the Canadian prime minister. But Trudeau had been well briefed, because as Trump extended his hand, Trudeau stepped right up to him, grabbing his right arm with free left hand. This, and the fact that Trudeau had managed to invade his personal space, made it virtually impossible for Trump to remind Trudeau who was really in charge by giving his hand a good yank. So why does Trump feel the need to physically manoeuvre people like this, and what does it say about his character? There are several possible explanations for Trump\u2019s \u201cyank-shake\u201d. One is that Trump has an irresistible urge to bring people closer to him, to get them on side, and this expresses itself in his habit of pulling people towards him. In support of this explanation it\u2019s worth noting that there are occasions when, having pulled someone towards him, Trump will switch to a more intimate upright handclasp, which of course requires even closer proximity. Another explanation for the \u201cyank-shake\u201d is that it enables Trump to impose himself on the situation by catching the other person unawares and doing something that they hadn\u2019t anticipated. After all, when they\u2019re shaking hands with the president, who would expect to have their arm almost wrenched out of its socket? It\u2019s noticeable that Trump\u2019s \u201cyank-shake\u201d has a lot in common with his political pronouncements \u2013 they\u2019re erratic, unpredictable and self-serving, and they don\u2019t always conform to the other goals that he\u2019s trying to achieve. But the real clue is to be found in the natural, underlying logic of greetings.

All power greetings \u2013 whether they involve bowing, curtsying or prostration \u2013 are asymmetrical. In other words, the actions of respect performed by one person are not performed by the other. Greetings of solidarity, on the other hand, are defined by their symmetry. In the handshake, for example, the fact that both people perform the same actions makes them equal to each other \u2013 the symmetry in their actions reinforces the symmetry in their relationship. There are of course ways that people can subvert the vital symmetry of the handshake \u2013 for example, by applying a vice-like grip, pumping the other person\u2019s hand too vigorously, or rotating the wrist so that your own hand ends up on top and the other person\u2019s underneath.

Movies, music and more await on the Culture pages. Diversions provide what I expect will be a welcome bit of light relief. We realise in putting the paper together that the international news can be difficult to digest. It makes these feature pages all the more important. I hope we\u2019ve informed, challenged and entertained in the edition now headed your way. Feedback on the editorial content can be sent by clicking here.

          "bodyText": "General Michael Flynn has resigned as Donald Trump\u2019s national security adviser after weeks of speculation over his links to Russia turned into days of reporting on the contents of his calls with the Russian ambassador and a day of intense pressure over whether the president could continue to back his pick. The resignation came late at night, at around 11pm Washington DC, after further news reports revealed that the White House had been warned last month by then acting attorney general Sally Yates \u2013 before she was fired for advising justice department lawyers that the travel ban was \u201cnot lawful\u201d \u2013 that Flynn was vulnerable to blackmail. Transcripts of intercepted calls between Flynn and Russian ambassador to the US, Sergey Kislyev, as described by US officials to various news outlets, showed the two had discussed sanctions ahead of Trump\u2019s inauguration, when Flynn was part of the transition team but not in post as national security adviser. Sanctions had been imposed by then-President Barack Obama after US agencies concluded Moscow had interfered in the US election campaign. In his resignation letter, Flynn conceded that he had misled the vice-president Mike Pence, who had previously publicly denied that Flynn had discussed sanctions with Kislyev. Flynn wrote: Unfortunately, because of the fast pace of events, I inadvertently briefed the vice-president-elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian ambassador. I have sincerely apologized to the president and the vice president, and they have accepted my apology. Read the resignation letter in full here. Keith Kellogg has been appointed acting national security adviser. He \u2013 along with David Petraeus, who meets Trump at the White House on Tuesday, and Robert Harward \u2013 are in the running to succeed Flynn. Read more Flynn quits after claims he secretly spoke with Russia, then lied about it Keith Kellogg: who is Trump\u2019s acting national security adviser? Richard Wolffe: Flynn might be done \u2013 but Trump\u2019s nightmare has just begun Kellogg aside, who else is in the running to succeed Flynn as national security adviser? Courtesy of AP, here\u2019s more on the men confirmed by White House sources as possible appointments: David Petraeus The most audacious choice would likely be former CIA director David Petraeus. Petraeus, a retired four-star general, was bounced from his position atop the intelligence agency in 2012 after he it was revealed that he passed on classified information to his biographer, who had also become his mistress. But Trump during the campaign spoke sympathetically about Petraeus, despite his frequent criticisms of his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton for mishandling classified materials. Petraeus was briefly under consideration to become secretary of state before Trump picked Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson. Robert Harward Robert Harward, a Navy Seal and retired vice-admiral, served as deputy commander of the United States central command when it was under the command of General James Mattis, who is now secretary of defense. He served on the National Security Council for President George W Bush and commissioned the National Counter Terrorism Center. Upon retirement in 2013 after a nearly 40-year career in the Navy, Harward took a post as a chief executive officer for defense and aerospace giant Lockheed Martin in the United Arab Emirates. Trump has recently been in very public negotiations with Lockheed over the cost of its F-35 fighter jet program. Kellogg, 72, named as Trump\u2019s acting national security adviser, was born in Ohio and served 36 years in the military: in the army in Vietnam, as a special forces officer in Cambodia, and during the first Iraq war as chief of staff for the 82nd Airborne Division. He rose to command the airborne division from 1997 to 1998 and later came to national prominence when he served as chief operating officer for Baghdad\u2019s provisional government through 2004 \u2013 a year of mistakes by the transitional administration that haunted Iraq through the next decade of war. After his retirement Kellogg joined a series of contracting firms including tech giant Oracle and defense contractor Cubic Defense. The retired general has kept a low profile in the White House compared with his predecessor. He was granted a formal role in Trump\u2019s transition team and later named chief of staff and executive secretary of the National Security Council, making him one military counterweight to an unusually prominent civilian on the council, Trump\u2019s chief strategist, Steve Bannon. Twitter has been full of helpful suggestions that Flynn could now spend more time with his conspiracy theories \u2013 but Hillary Clinton has now joined their ranks. Flynn notoriously tweeted a link to an entirely fake story that a DC pizzeria called Comet Ping Pong was linked to a child abuse ring involving the Clintons. The US national security adviser, Michael Flynn, resigned late on Monday night amid a flow of intelligence leaks that he had secretly discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador to Washington and then tried to cover up the conversations. The resignation, with the Trump era less than four weeks old, is the latest and most dramatic convulsion in the most chaotic start to an administration in modern US history. It was far from clear whether Flynn\u2019s departure would steady an inexperienced and feuding White House, or resolve the lingering suspicions about the Trump team\u2019s pre-election contacts with the Kremlin. The White House issued a statement just after 11pm in Washington announcing the resignation, shortly after reports broke that the Trump administration had been warned weeks ago that Flynn might be vulnerable to Russian blackmail. The statement also named retired army general Joseph Keith Kellogg as acting national security adviser, pending the appointment of a permanent successor. It was reported that a third general, former CIA director David Petraeus, was due to meet Trump on Tuesday. In his resignation letter, Flynn claimed he had mistakenly misled vice-president Mike Pence and other Trump officials about the nature of phone calls in December to the Russian ambassador, Sergei Kisilyak. When intelligence leaks about the communications began appearing last month, Pence and other White House officials insisted the contact had involved only an exchange of Christmas greetings and arrangements for a future phone conversation between Trump and Vladimir Putin. However, subsequent leaks suggested that they had been more substantial, and concerned sanctions the Obama administration was about to impose on Moscow for interference in the presidential elections. Intelligence officials claimed that Flynn had given the impression the sanctions might be lifted once the Trump administration came to office on 20 January. Republican Devin Nunes, chair of the House intelligence committee, is the first supportive voice I\u2019ve so far seen for Flynn since news broke of his resignation: Michael Flynn served in the US military for more than three decades. Washington DC can be a rough town for honorable people, and Flynn \u2013 who has always been a soldier, not a politician \u2013 deserves America\u2019s gratitude and respect for dedicating so much of his life to strengthening our national security. I thank him for his many years of distinguished service. Flynn\u2019s resignation letter doesn\u2019t go into detail of his communications with the Russian ambassador to the US, Sergey Kislyev. Transcripts of intercepted calls, though, as described by US officials to various news outlets, showed that the two had discussed sanctions \u2013 although not necessarily going so far as Flynn promising that Trump would lift them. The conversations have been described as \u201cpotentially illegal\u201d because of the 1799 Logan Act, which bans private citizens from negotiating with countries with which the US is in dispute. The calls were made before Trump\u2019s inauguration, when Flynn was part of the transition team but not in post as national security adviser. But many have said the wider issue is the extent of any collusion between Russia and the Trump administration. That issue remains unresolved by Flynn\u2019s ousting. As with the travel ban, Sally Yates \u2013 the former acting attorney general, fired from that role by Trump after she advised justice department lawyers that the executive order was \u201cnot lawful\u201d \u2013 finds herself at the centre of this story. As the Washington Post reports, Yates reported to the White House in January her concerns over Flynn\u2019s potential susceptibility to blackmail due to his communications with Russia: The acting attorney general informed the Trump White House late last month that she believed Michael Flynn had misled senior administration officials about the nature of his communications with the Russian ambassador to the United States, and warned that the national security adviser was potentially vulnerable to Russian blackmail, current and former U.S. officials said. The message, delivered by Sally Q. Yates and a senior career national security official to the White House counsel, was prompted by concerns that Flynn, when asked about his calls and texts with the Russian diplomat, had told Vice President-elect Mike Pence and others that he had not discussed the Obama administration sanctions on Russia for its interference in the 2016 election, the officials said. It is unclear what the White House counsel, Donald McGahn, did with the information. Just hours before his resignation, Flynn was in the front row as Trump held a joint press conference with Canada\u2019s prime minister Justin Trudeau. The US president took two questions from reporters \u2013 neither of which were about his then national security adviser \u2013 and ignored shouted queries from other journalists as he left the room. As so often, it\u2019s the attempted cover-up that can sting you. Here\u2019s Michael McFaul, a former US ambassador to Russia under Obama, on why the misleading of Pence by Flynn was what did for the latter: The future of Michael Flynn had looked uncertain since Friday, after reports that he had discussed US sanctions with the Russian ambassador to Washington before taking office, contrary to his earlier adamant denials. The reports, based on leaks from current and former officials, also point to contacts between the former general and Russian officials going back to before the 8 November election \u2013 an election that the US intelligence agencies believe Russia tried to influence in Donald Trump\u2019s favour. Both the Washington Post and the New York Times reported that Flynn talked to the Russian ambassador, Sergei Kisilyak, about forthcoming sanctions from the Obama administration in response to Russian electoral meddling. The allegations led to calls from Democrats for Flynn to be dismissed while some prominent Republicans were tepid in their support. When asked by reporters aboard Air Force One about the report, Trump replied: \u201cI don\u2019t know about that. I haven\u2019t seen it. What report is that? I haven\u2019t seen that. I\u2019ll look into that.\u201d Flynn and the US vice-president, Mike Pence, had previously issued flat denials that Flynn and Kisilyak had spoken about anything of substance and the White House had insisted that the conversations involved only the exchange of Christmas greetings and preparations for a future Trump phone call with Vladimir Putin. On Friday, Flynn\u2019s staff at the national security council said he could no longer be sure whether sanctions had been discussed. Questions about who knew what within the Trump administration \u2013 up to and including the president himself \u2013 will not disappear with Flynn\u2019s retreating figure. Eyebrows had already been raised by this tweet from Trump, after Russian president Vladimir Putin announced he would not retaliate after the expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats by the Obama administration, following allegations of Moscow meddling in the US election: Now, given Flynn\u2019s conversations with the Russian ambassador \u2013 and his confessed misleading of the then VP-elect \u2013 Trump and his team will be pressed on what they knew of his communications. Whether they\u2019ll answer is, of course, a different matter. Democrat Adam Schiff, ranking member of the House permanent select committee on intelligence, said the resignation was inevitable and Flynn had been a \u201cpoor choice\u201d for the role: General Flynn\u2019s decision to step down as national security adviser was all but ordained the day he misled the country about his secret talks with the Russian ambassador. In fact, Flynn was always a poor choice for national security adviser, a role in which you need to be a consensus builder, and possess sobriety and steady judgment. It is certainly no role for someone who plays fast and loose with the truth. But Flynn\u2019s departure does not end questions over his contacts with the Russians, which have been alleged to have begun well before December 29. These alleged contacts and any others the Trump campaign may have had with the Kremlin are the subject of the House intelligence committee\u2019s ongoing investigation. Moreover, the Trump administration has yet to be forthcoming about who was aware of Flynn\u2019s conversations with the ambassador and whether he was acting on the instructions of the president or any other officials, or with their knowledge. Life moves pretty fast. Here\u2019s Kellyanne Conway, a key counsellor to Trump, declaring just a few hours ago that Flynn had the \u201cfull confidence\u201d of the president. The late-night nature of the resignation suggests deliberations over Flynn\u2019s departure were pummelled along by Monday\u2019s steady stream of revelations, from the Washington Post, Associated Press and New York Times. As AP reports: Flynn was spotted near the Oval Office just after 10pm Monday. Amid the uncertainty over Flynn\u2019s future, several of the president\u2019s top advisers, including chief of staff Reince Priebus and counsel Don McGahn, ducked in and out of late-night meetings in the West Wing. Russia Today has a gentler spin on Flynn\u2019s abrupt departure: Donald Trump\u2019s administration was warned by the justice department of Michael Flynn\u2019s communications with Russia, the Associated Press reported earlier on Monday. Hours after the White House said the president was \u201cevaluating\u201d allegations that Flynn lied about secret communications with Russia and misled Vice-president Mike Pence \u2013 but before his dramatic late-nigth resignation \u2013 sources familiar with the situation told the Associated Press that the Trump administration was aware of the justice department\u2019s warning that Flynn might be vulnerable to Russian blackmail \u201cfor weeks\u201d. The Washington Post first reported on the DoJ\u2019s warning, which came in late December from then acting attorney general Sally Yates. Yates was fired by Trump last month after she refused to defend his travel ban against refugees and residents of seven Muslim-majority countries. According to the Post, Yates\u2019 concerns that Flynn lied about the nature of his communications with Russia were shared by James Clapper, the outgoing director of national intelligence, and John Brennan, then the director of the CIA. Flynn lasted less than a month in his role \u2013 the shortest holder of that office ever, it seems (and by some margin): Three names are being bandied around as possible successors to Flynn, including Keith Kellogg (now in place as acting national security adviser), David Petraeus and Bob Harward. Reports earlier said Petraeus was due to meet Trump at the White House on Tuesday. The retired general resigned as head of the CIA in 2012 for passing classified information to a lover. February 13, 2017 In the course of my duties as the incoming National Security Advisor, I held numerous phone calls with foreign counterparts, ministers, and ambassadors. These calls were to facilitate a smooth transition and begin to build the necessary relationships between the President, his advisors and foreign leaders. Such calls are standard practice in any transition of this magnitude. Unfortunately, because of the fast pace of events, I inadvertently briefed the Vice President Elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian Ambassador. I have sincerely apologized to the President and the Vice President, and they have accepted my apology. Throughout my over thirty three years of honorable military service, and my tenure as the National Security Advisor, I have always performed my duties with the utmost of integrity and honesty to those I have served, to include the President of the United States. I am tendering my resignation, honored to have served our nation and the American people in such a distinguished way. I am also extremely honored to have served President Trump, who in just three weeks, has reoriented American foreign policy in fundamental ways to restore America\u2019s leadership position in the world. As I step away once again from serving my nation in this current capacity, I wish to thank President Trump for his personal loyalty, the friendship of those who I worked with throughout the hard fought campaign, the challenging period of transition, and during the early days of his presidency. I know with the strong leadership of President Donald J. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence and the superb team they are assembling, this team will go down in history as one of the greatest presidencies in U.S. history, and I firmly believe the American people will be well served as they all work together to help Make America Great Again. Michael T. Flynn, LTG (Ret) Assistant to the President / National Security Advisor An emailed statement from the White House leads on news that Keith Kellogg is new acting national security adviser, relegating the key news headline that Flynn is gone to second mention. It reads: President Donald J. Trump Names Lt. General Joseph Keith Kellogg, Jr. as Acting National Security Advisor Accepts Resignation of Lt. General Michael Flynn President Donald J. Trump has named Lt. General Joseph Keith Kellogg, Jr. (Ret) as Acting National Security Advisor following the resignation of Lt. General Michael Flynn (Ret). General Kellogg is a decorated veteran of the United States Army, having served from 1967 to 2003, including two tours during the Vietnam War, where he earned the Silver Star, the Bronze Star with \u201cV\u201d device, and the Air Medal with \u201cV\u201d device. He served as the Commander of the 82nd Airborne Division from 1997 to 1998. Prior to his retirement, General Kellogg was Director of the Command, Control, Communications, and Computers Directorate under the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Keith Kellogg becomes the acting head of the national security council. Initial reports about the communications between Flynn and Kislyak had been roundly denounced by Flynn, with vice-president Mike Pence defending him in front of the media. On 15 January, Pence told CBS News of a call between Flynn and the Russian ambassador: They did not discuss anything having to do with the United States\u2019 decision to expel diplomats or impose censure against Russia. But last week a report in the Washington Post, citing nine unnamed current and former US officials, said Flynn did indeed discuss the \u201cpotentially illegal\u201d topic with the Russian ambassador. In recent days, Pence was reported to have been troubled by the possibility he had been misled by Flynn. Earlier on Monday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer appeared to confirm that Flynn had apologised to Pence: Here is the full text of Flynn\u2019s resignation letter in which he admits he inadvertently briefed the vice-president-elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian ambassador. The Trump administration has its first high-profile departure: General Michael Flynn, national security adviser, has left his post after reports that he did \u2013 despite denials \u2013 discuss the lifting of US sanctions with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the transition. CNN reported two sources had confirmed his resignation and cited his resignation letter: Bloomberg also reported his departure: We\u2019ll have the latest on Flynn\u2019s resignation and the fallout live here.",

Hours after the White House said the president was \u201cevaluating\u201d allegations that Flynn lied about secret communications with Russia and misled the vice-president, Mike Pence, sources familiar with the situation were cited by the Associated Press as saying the Trump administration was aware \u201cfor weeks\u201d of a justice department warning that Flynn might be vulnerable to Russian blackmail. The Washington Post first reported on the DoJ\u2019s warning, which came in late December from then acting attorney general Sally Yates.

          "body": "<p>There was a point in 2016 when it seemed the Canada\u2013European Union free trade deal \u2013 Ceta \u2013 was not going to make it. Ironically, Donald Trump\u2019s election as president of the United States has all but assured its approval in Europe. Resistance to Ceta, which had been building quietly in Europe for several years, exploded into massive street protests in Germany and Brussels in the middle of 2016. The lightning rod was the inclusion of rights for investors to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/06/transatlantic-trade-partnership-ttip-canada-eu\" title=\"\">challenge public policies that harm their profits</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/06/transatlantic-trade-partnership-ttip-canada-eu\">The transatlantic trade deal TTIP may be dead, but something even worse is coming | George Monbiot</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But other parts of Ceta were rightly criticised for how they would weaken the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2013/jul/12/precautionary-principle-science-policy\" title=\"\">precautionary principle</a> and undermine public services. These concerns, and studies showing the agreement would suppress wage and job growth on both sides of the Atlantic, should have sucked the air out of any promises of a new, sustainable trade regime. And yet, in this upside-down post-Trump world, an agreement that will contribute to widening inequality is being spun, impossibly, as a victory for progress. An agreement negotiated by Stephen Harper\u2019s government (one of the most rightwing Canada has ever seen) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/27/sovereignty-corporations-liam-fox-eu\" title=\"\">on behalf of, and with input mainly from, very large corporations</a>, will be declared a major boon for the struggling middle class.</p> <p>Justin Trudeau, Canada\u2019s prime minister, plans to be in Strasbourg next week for the European parliament vote \u2013 to <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-europe-trip-eu-1.3972534\" title=\"\">give Ceta a final Midas touch</a> that will transform it from political hot potato to <a href=\"https://www.theparliamentmagazine.eu/articles/interview/chrystia-freeland-ceta-truly-gold-standard-agreement\" title=\"\">\u201cgold standard\u201d trade deal</a>. Unfortunately, in its current form Ceta will only fuel Trumpism and its European variants on the far-right.</p> <p>Despite some last-minute procedural reforms, Ceta will eventually expose European regulations to more investor lawsuits from Canadian resource firms and the Canadian subsidiaries of US multinational corporations, ushering in, through the back door, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/20/david-cameron-support-ttip\" title=\"\">hated part of TTIP</a>, the supposedly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/05/protest-never-changes-anything-derailing-ttip-trade-agreement\" title=\"\">moribund EU-US free trade deal</a>. Ceta also advances a longstanding North American demand for \u201cregulatory cooperation\u201d, a euphemism for an early warning system that allows foreign corporations to nip unwanted regulations in the bud. The election of Trump, who is already unleashing a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/09/devil-may-care-investors-fall-spell-trump-mania-congress\" title=\"\">deregulatory tsunami</a> in the US, only heightens the threat this new framework poses.</p> <p>Far from acting as a counterweight to Trump, the Canadian corporate sector is already pressing the Trudeau government to match the US president\u2019s deregulatory moves in order to remain competitive in their most important market. Ceta\u2019s regulatory cooperation mechanisms will provide an avenue for North American lobbyists to quietly deploy downward pressure against EU regulations. This is particularly true in sensitive areas such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/mar/24/gmo-food-labels-general-mills-kellog-mars\" title=\"\">genetically modified organisms</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/16/new-rules-to-regulate-europes-hormone-disrupting-chemicals\" title=\"\">endocrine-disrupting chemicals</a>, where Canada and the US have continually <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/22/eu-dropped-pesticide-laws-due-to-us-pressure-over-ttip-documents-reveal\" title=\"\">challenged the EU diplomatically</a> and at the World Trade Organisation.</p> <p>Ceta also fails to live up to its \u201cgold standard\u201d hype for what is missing from the agreement. Despite what the European commission says about its hastily cobbled together \u201cunderstanding\u201d on Ceta, the text contains no valid general carve-out for public services, which are shielded from Ceta\u2019s powerful investment and services obligations <a href=\"http://behindthenumbers.ca/2016/10/14/flimsy-ceta-declaration-leaves-public-services-water-policy-vulnerable-canada-eu-deal/\" title=\"\">only grudgingly</a> and in a piecemeal manner.</p> <p>On our side of the pond, Ceta forces Canada to change its patent protection system in ways that are expected to add <a href=\"http://cdn.wfp.org/2016/syria/?lead_source=2016-globeandmail-syria&amp;form_tag=2016-globeandmail-syria\" title=\"\">C$850m a year</a> to the costs of medications. Canadians already pay the second-highest drug costs per capita in the developed world. Ceta\u2019s stricter intellectual property rules will more than cancel out the potential benefits to Canadian consumers of tariff elimination on all EU imports into Canada.</p> <p>As Thomas Piketty and others have highlighted, the Canada-EU deal also contains no binding targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

          "bodyText": "There was a point in 2016 when it seemed the Canada\u2013European Union free trade deal \u2013 Ceta \u2013 was not going to make it. Ironically, Donald Trump\u2019s election as president of the United States has all but assured its approval in Europe. Resistance to Ceta, which had been building quietly in Europe for several years, exploded into massive street protests in Germany and Brussels in the middle of 2016. The lightning rod was the inclusion of rights for investors to challenge public policies that harm their profits. But other parts of Ceta were rightly criticised for how they would weaken the precautionary principle and undermine public services. These concerns, and studies showing the agreement would suppress wage and job growth on both sides of the Atlantic, should have sucked the air out of any promises of a new, sustainable trade regime. And yet, in this upside-down post-Trump world, an agreement that will contribute to widening inequality is being spun, impossibly, as a victory for progress. An agreement negotiated by Stephen Harper\u2019s government (one of the most rightwing Canada has ever seen) on behalf of, and with input mainly from, very large corporations, will be declared a major boon for the struggling middle class. Justin Trudeau, Canada\u2019s prime minister, plans to be in Strasbourg next week for the European parliament vote \u2013 to give Ceta a final Midas touch that will transform it from political hot potato to \u201cgold standard\u201d trade deal. Unfortunately, in its current form Ceta will only fuel Trumpism and its European variants on the far-right. Despite some last-minute procedural reforms, Ceta will eventually expose European regulations to more investor lawsuits from Canadian resource firms and the Canadian subsidiaries of US multinational corporations, ushering in, through the back door, a hated part of TTIP, the supposedly moribund EU-US free trade deal. Ceta also advances a longstanding North American demand for \u201cregulatory cooperation\u201d, a euphemism for an early warning system that allows foreign corporations to nip unwanted regulations in the bud. The election of Trump, who is already unleashing a deregulatory tsunami in the US, only heightens the threat this new framework poses. Far from acting as a counterweight to Trump, the Canadian corporate sector is already pressing the Trudeau government to match the US president\u2019s deregulatory moves in order to remain competitive in their most important market. Ceta\u2019s regulatory cooperation mechanisms will provide an avenue for North American lobbyists to quietly deploy downward pressure against EU regulations. This is particularly true in sensitive areas such as genetically modified organisms and endocrine-disrupting chemicals, where Canada and the US have continually challenged the EU diplomatically and at the World Trade Organisation. Ceta also fails to live up to its \u201cgold standard\u201d hype for what is missing from the agreement. Despite what the European commission says about its hastily cobbled together \u201cunderstanding\u201d on Ceta, the text contains no valid general carve-out for public services, which are shielded from Ceta\u2019s powerful investment and services obligations only grudgingly and in a piecemeal manner. On our side of the pond, Ceta forces Canada to change its patent protection system in ways that are expected to add C$850m a year to the costs of medications. Canadians already pay the second-highest drug costs per capita in the developed world. Ceta\u2019s stricter intellectual property rules will more than cancel out the potential benefits to Canadian consumers of tariff elimination on all EU imports into Canada. As Thomas Piketty and others have highlighted, the Canada-EU deal also contains no binding targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, Ceta hardly mentions climate change at all. Its protections for labour, the environment and sustainable development are essentially toothless. European social democrats should be ashamed to endorse them, let alone portray them as a victory for workers. Environmentalists, consumer advocates, trade unions, political progressives and many small- and medium-sized enterprises, on the other hand, are right to ask the European parliament to block this Canadian deal. With Ceta the idea of \u201csocial Europe\u201d \u2013 the cooperative, progressive counterpoint to a union organised primarily for the benefit of transnational capital \u2013 recedes further into the imagination. The rebranding of Ceta as a progressive, \u201cgold standard\u201d agreement is hardly an antidote to the frightening resurgence of rightwing nationalism that preys on the inequalities and insecurities created by the type of globalisation that is codified and enforced in Ceta\u2019s two-dozen chapters. It is precisely that type of self-serving spin that fuels public cynicism and anger at liberal elites. If one of the lessons of the Brexit vote is that too many citizens feel they are losing control over their lives and economic futures, then sleepwalking into a trade deal that will cede even more democratic authority to the corporate sector is playing with fire. \u2022 This piece was co-authored by Scott Sinclair, a senior research fellow at the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives",

Trump has kept Flynn close ever since the retired lieutenant general became one of few former Pentagon chiefs to back his campaign.</p> <p>But Flynn has also long held links to the Kremlin, including appearances on the propaganda arm RT, and has few allies in the intelligence agencies, from which he was <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/10/how-mike-flynn-became-americas-angriest-general-214362\">acrimoniously</a> ousted during the Obama administration.<br></p> <p>In December, weeks before Trump\u2019s inauguration, Flynn spoke with Russia\u2019s ambassador, Sergei Kislyak, by phone. He and Vice-President Mike Pence denied that he spoke with Kislyak about sanctions placed on high-level officials by the US government, which could have violated a federal law that bars private citizens from interfering in diplomatic disputes. </p> <p>On Thursday, however, nine current and former officials told the Washington Post that Flynn had in fact <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/national-security-adviser-flynn-discussed-sanctions-with-russian-ambassador-despite-denials-officials-say/2017/02/09/f85b29d6-ee11-11e6-b4ff-ac2cf509efe5_story.html?utm_term=.e5cc347faebe\">discussed sanctions</a>, imposed over Russian actions in Ukraine and hacking political parties in the 2016 US election.</p> <p>A spokesman for Flynn subsequently reversed course, saying the former general \u201ccouldn\u2019t be certain\u201d that he had not discussed sanctions.

Leading Democrats, including the ranking member on the intelligence committee, have called for an FBI investigation.</p> <p>Trump was expected to be asked about Flynn at a press conference with Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau on Monday. On Monday morning the Kremlin denied that Flynn and Kislyak had spoken about lifting sanctions.</p> <p>Flynn emerged as an obstreperous force during the campaign and become an ally of the president\u2019s chief strategist, Steve Bannon.

          "bodyText": "A senior White House official has refused to say if Donald Trump supports his national security adviser, Michael Flynn, who reportedly spoke with Russia\u2019s ambassador about sanctions relief weeks before the new president took office. \u201cIt\u2019s not for me to tell you what\u2019s in the president\u2019s mind,\u201d Stephen Miller, a senior policy adviser to Trump, told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press. \u201cThat\u2019s a question for the president. Asked and answered.\u201d Asked if the White House had given him any guidance on Flynn\u2019s position, Miller said: \u201cThey did not give me anything to say.\u201d Against a backdrop of potentially hazardous international flashpoints, including North Korean ballistic missile tests and intensified civil war in Ukraine, the president\u2019s closest aide would normally be his national security adviser. Trump has kept Flynn close ever since the retired lieutenant general became one of few former Pentagon chiefs to back his campaign. But Flynn has also long held links to the Kremlin, including appearances on the propaganda arm RT, and has few allies in the intelligence agencies, from which he was acrimoniously ousted during the Obama administration. In December, weeks before Trump\u2019s inauguration, Flynn spoke with Russia\u2019s ambassador, Sergei Kislyak, by phone. He and Vice-President Mike Pence denied that he spoke with Kislyak about sanctions placed on high-level officials by the US government, which could have violated a federal law that bars private citizens from interfering in diplomatic disputes. On Thursday, however, nine current and former officials told the Washington Post that Flynn had in fact discussed sanctions, imposed over Russian actions in Ukraine and hacking political parties in the 2016 US election. A spokesman for Flynn subsequently reversed course, saying the former general \u201ccouldn\u2019t be certain\u201d that he had not discussed sanctions. The White House said Pence had only heard about the call from Flynn. More than a day after the publication of the report, Trump professed ignorance about it, saying he would \u201clook into\u201d the call. Leading Democrats, including the ranking member on the intelligence committee, have called for an FBI investigation. Trump was expected to be asked about Flynn at a press conference with Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau on Monday. On Monday morning the Kremlin denied that Flynn and Kislyak had spoken about lifting sanctions. Flynn emerged as an obstreperous force during the campaign and become an ally of the president\u2019s chief strategist, Steve Bannon. Both men remain close to Trump despite the tides of criticism washing over them. Beyond Flynn\u2019s friendliness toward Russia and his poor relations with intelligence agencies \u2013 the CIA rejected a security clearance for one of his aides this week \u2013 his son personally provoked Trump\u2019s wrath for peddling a conspiracy theory about a Washington pizza shop. Bannon, a businessman who formerly ran Breitbart News \u2013 a website popular with the far right and known for its racist and sexist articles \u2013 prompted bipartisan alarm when he was named to the National Security Council in a post outranking the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and the director of national intelligence. Miller, himself close to Bannon, seemed to allude to backstage machinations which have produced a steady stream of leaks to the press from White House aides critical of each other. \u201cIt\u2019s a sensitive matter,\u201d Miller said on NBC. \u201cGeneral Flynn has served his country admirably. He served his country with distinction.\u201d As if on cue after Miller\u2019s appearance, the president tweeted from his weekend stay at his south Florida club, Mar-a-Lago, where he was hosting Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe. \u201cCongratulations Stephen Miller,\u201d the president wrote, \u201con representing me this morning on the various Sunday morning shows. Great job!\u201d Trump is an avid viewer of cable news, despite his protestations to the contrary, but the White House fielded few representatives on Sunday\u2019s news shows. The New Jersey governor, Chris Christie, who was ousted from Trump\u2019s transition team by the businessman\u2019s son-in-law, told CNN\u2019s State of the Union that Trump, Pence and Flynn would have to meet about whether the general deliberately misled the vice-president. \u201cThat\u2019s a conversation he is going to need to have with the president and the vice-president to clear that up,\u201d Christie said, \u201cso that the White House can make sure that they are completely accurate about what went on.\u201d On Saturday night, the president had little to say about North Korea\u2019s missile test. \u201cI just want everybody to understand and fully know that the United States of America stands behind Japan, it\u2019s great ally, 100%,\u201d Trump said. \u201cNorth Korea must fully comply with the relevant UN security council resolutions,\u201d Abe said, adding that the launch \u201cabsolutely intolerable\u201d. Miller told Fox News Sunday: \u201cThe message is that we are going to reinforce and strengthen our vital alliances in the Pacific region.\u201d The Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, said he was sure North Korea was \u201ctesting\u201d Trump. \u201cI was glad he issued the statement with the prime minister of Japan,\u201d Schumer said on CBS\u2019s Face the Nation. \u201cBut he also ought to do it quickly with South Korea. \u201cSouth Korea is probably more susceptible to North Korea\u2019s virulence than any other country. And there was some doubt cast on the relationship in the campaign by then candidate Trump.\u201d Trump\u2019s remarks on Saturday fell in line with conventional US foreign policy \u2013 and not campaign suggestions that Asian countries should build nuclear arsenals or pay the US more to defend them. Earlier this week, Trump similarly backed down from his suggestion that the US would not recognize Beijing\u2019s \u201cOne China\u201d policy, and might instead review Taiwan\u2019s status of independence.",

Imagine people of faith going to pray in peace, to pray for peace, and to be at risk. Houses of worship are sacred and must be protected.\u201d Hundreds of people in Toronto \u2013 many of them belonging to local synagogues, churches and temples \u2013 stood shoulder-to-shoulder outside seven of the city\u2019s mosques on Friday during midday prayers. In Ottawa and Edmonton, similar \u201crings of peace\u201d were set up around local mosques. The idea was inspired by a group of Muslims in Oslo, said Splansky. In 2015, as Jewish communities across Europe were reeling from antisemitic attacks in France and Denmark, Muslims organised to stand guard around the synagogue in Oslo while those inside offered Sabbath prayers. In Newfoundland on Friday, hundreds gathered to form a \u201chuman shield\u201d to protect Muslims at the province\u2019s only mosque in St John\u2019s. Speaking to the crowd, Syed Pirzada of the Muslim Association of Newfoundland and Labrador said the Muslim community had been overwhelmed by the outpouring of support they had received in recent days. \u201cAlthough this tragedy has taken irreparable toll on Muslims across the country, the kindness and generosity of fellow Canadians has been a great source of comfort,\u201d said Pirzada. \u201cCanada has spoken: no to hate, no to bigotry, no to religious violence, no to intolerance.\u201d Thousands across Canada have come together to condemn the actions of a gunman who walked into a mosque in Quebec City on Sunday and opened fire, killing six people and injuring another 19.

If a binary system has a one or zero at opposite poles of a sphere, then a quantum one has values anywhere and everywhere. </p> <p>This makes a quantum system fast at calculating because it can test every possibility simultaneously; no waiting for one calculation after another. Interrupt it at any given time to collapse it at one of its states, and hey presto you have your answer. </p> <p>There is, of course, a caveat: you have to control the qubits and the subatomic particles in which they are stored. And that is very, very hard indeed. Even the likes of Intel, which last year pledged $50m (\u00a339m) to quantum computing research at the University of Delft, admit that a practical quantum computer is at least a decade away. </p> <h2>Privacy is dead</h2> <p>What can we look forward to when quantum computers do arrive? Well, there\u2019s the death of encryption for a start.</p> <p>Encryption of data relies upon how time consuming it is to factor very large numbers into two primes. A quantum computer will quickly decrypt data that would take billions of years today. You might think this bad from the security perspective, allowing criminals to decrypt every encrypted database. </p> <p>But quantum research is expensive, very expensive. So the \u201cgood guys\u201d, with the government budgets, will get the tech first, by a long margin. And when the bad guys do get all the gear, what quantum giveth it will soon taketh away again. While quantum computers will crack most any encryption, you\u2019ll know your data\u2019s been looked at, thanks to something called entanglement. Einstein called this <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/427174/einsteins-spooky-action-at-a-distance-paradox-older-than-thought/\">\u201cspooky action at a distance\u201d</a> and spooky it may be, but it does provide us with perfect privacy. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2016/dec/08/5g-cognitive-radio-future-connectivity-business\">Quantum key distribution</a> systems are already being developed that will know if they are being eavesdropped on and stop communicating until the spy goes away. </p> <h2>What will governments do with quantum?</h2> <p>Can quantum help governments wage war? Perhaps. The Ministry of Defence lab at Porton Down has been developing a device to measure tiny fluctuations in gravitational pull, which would act like <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/gravity-sensor-detector-see-through-walls-underground-ministry-of-defence-mod-bbc-horizon-project-a6947906.html\">super accurate radar</a>, with the capability to see through walls or deep underground. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/nov/04/relativity-quantum-mechanics-universe-physicists\">Relativity v quantum mechanics \u2013 the battle for the universe </a> </p> </aside>  <p>But some of the most exciting possibilities lie in the area of public health. Researchers at the University of Glasgow, working for one of the quantum technology hubs, established through \u00a3120m of UK investment, are hoping to revolutionise quantum imaging. Their projects include developing ultrasensitive cameras that can actually detect light down to a single photon. This has the potential to detect cancer without invasive medical imaging. </p> <p>And Australian researchers from the government-funded <a href=\"http://www.cqc2t.org/\">Centre for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology</a> are taking the field of medical imaging into a whole new dimension. Rather than using magnets to create 3D images, the team\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms12667\">nano-MRI project </a>uses the natural magnetic properties of the qubit to, in theory at least, allow imaging at the molecular level. If used to determine the structure of biomolecules such as proteins it could overcome many issues researchers face when developing new drugs.</p> <p>At the moment quantum computing is largely speculative and hugely expensive. It has staggering potential, but it remains to be seen whether governments\u2019 investments will pay off in the real world of public services. </p> <p><strong>Talk to us on Twitter via </strong><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianpublic\">@Guardianpublic</a> and </strong><strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/public-leaders/\">sign up</a></strong><strong> for your free weekly Guardian Public Leaders newsletter with news and analysis sent direct to you every Thursday.</strong></p>",

Quantum has touched a political nerve, from the UK\u2019s National Quantum Technologies Programme, Australia\u2019s Centre for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology or the European Union\u2019s \u20ac1bn (\u00a30.9bn) for an EU quantum manifesto, not to mention Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s well-documented knowledge of the topic. What is quantum technology? When you think of quantum you\u2019re transported into the subatomic world of Schr\u00f6dinger and his cat and the ability to be in two states at the same time. In the case of the cat, locked in a box with a randomly triggered radiation source, it\u2019s both alive and dead until the box is opened and it can be observed as either one or the other. In the quantum computing world, the bits at the heart of a computer with a binary state of either one or zero become qubits (quantum bits), which can simultaneously be a one, zero, both or anything in-between. If a binary system has a one or zero at opposite poles of a sphere, then a quantum one has values anywhere and everywhere. This makes a quantum system fast at calculating because it can test every possibility simultaneously; no waiting for one calculation after another. Interrupt it at any given time to collapse it at one of its states, and hey presto you have your answer. There is, of course, a caveat: you have to control the qubits and the subatomic particles in which they are stored. And that is very, very hard indeed. Even the likes of Intel, which last year pledged $50m (\u00a339m) to quantum computing research at the University of Delft, admit that a practical quantum computer is at least a decade away. Privacy is dead What can we look forward to when quantum computers do arrive? Well, there\u2019s the death of encryption for a start. Encryption of data relies upon how time consuming it is to factor very large numbers into two primes. A quantum computer will quickly decrypt data that would take billions of years today. You might think this bad from the security perspective, allowing criminals to decrypt every encrypted database. But quantum research is expensive, very expensive. So the \u201cgood guys\u201d, with the government budgets, will get the tech first, by a long margin. And when the bad guys do get all the gear, what quantum giveth it will soon taketh away again. While quantum computers will crack most any encryption, you\u2019ll know your data\u2019s been looked at, thanks to something called entanglement. Einstein called this \u201cspooky action at a distance\u201d and spooky it may be, but it does provide us with perfect privacy. Quantum key distribution systems are already being developed that will know if they are being eavesdropped on and stop communicating until the spy goes away. What will governments do with quantum? Can quantum help governments wage war? Perhaps. The Ministry of Defence lab at Porton Down has been developing a device to measure tiny fluctuations in gravitational pull, which would act like super accurate radar, with the capability to see through walls or deep underground. But some of the most exciting possibilities lie in the area of public health. Researchers at the University of Glasgow, working for one of the quantum technology hubs, established through \u00a3120m of UK investment, are hoping to revolutionise quantum imaging. Their projects include developing ultrasensitive cameras that can actually detect light down to a single photon. This has the potential to detect cancer without invasive medical imaging. And Australian researchers from the government-funded Centre for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology are taking the field of medical imaging into a whole new dimension. Rather than using magnets to create 3D images, the team\u2019s nano-MRI project uses the natural magnetic properties of the qubit to, in theory at least, allow imaging at the molecular level. If used to determine the structure of biomolecules such as proteins it could overcome many issues researchers face when developing new drugs. At the moment quantum computing is largely speculative and hugely expensive. It has staggering potential, but it remains to be seen whether governments\u2019 investments will pay off in the real world of public services.

Bissonnette was silent for the rest of the evening, and never attended another event \u2013 but Debroise kept in touch with him on social media. In the wake of the shooting, Debroise contacted the police, describing Bissonnette as \u201cfar-right and an ultra-nationalist white supremacist\u201d. He also flagged to police past comments he had heard Bissonnette make about the Jewish community. Toma Popescu, a high school classmate of Bissonnette, described him as a timid introvert. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a big personality. You wouldn\u2019t notice him.\u201d He was often bullied by other students over the way he dressed and his habit of collecting rocks, said Popescu. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know what he was thinking, ever.\u201d Months ago Popescu began hearing from other classmates that Bissonnette\u2019s views had begun to harden. \u201cI heard that he was very radical and that he loved Donald Trump,\u201d he said. For one local group dedicated to welcoming refugees, Bienvenu aux r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s, Bissonnette\u2019s name was a familiar one. The group described him as an online troll who took aim at refugees and expressed support for Le Pen. In a Facebook post, the group said Bissonnette was \u201cunfortunately known by several campaigners in Qu\u00e9bec City for his viewpoints that were pro-Le Pen and anti-feminist, as expressed in social media and at the Universit\u00e9 Laval\u201d. Bissonnette did not hide his hostility toward Muslims during a long interrogation by police, Montreal\u2019s La Presse newspaper said, citing a source close to the investigation. Sunday\u2019s attack was swiftly condemned by politicians of all stripes, but Montreal police said reports of hate crimes in the city had risen since Sunday\u2019s attack, with more than a dozen calls coming in. On Wednesday, a 47-year-old man was arrested after allegedly making online threats against Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s Muslim community. Thousands of others across Canada have denounced the attack, holding vigils and sending messages of support to the mosque through social media. A GoFundMe page, set up to help the families of the victims with funeral costs, had raised more than C$240,000 to date while a Toronto businessman has offered to cover the full cost of repairs and renovations to the mosque. Six people \u2013 all fathers with deep roots in this tight-knit community \u2013 were killed in the attack. Another 19 people were wounded. Two remain in critical condition. In Qu\u00e9bec city, dozens of bouquets were piled up outside the shuttered entrance of Boucherie Assalam, the grocery owned by Azzeddine Soufiane. On Sunday evening the 57-year-old had closed up shop to make the short drive to the mosque, a journey the devout father of three made at least once a day. He was well-known in the city\u2019s 6,700-strong Muslim community. \u201cHe was almost like the president of the community,\u201d Nouzha Enkila, head of a Moroccan community group called La Voix des Marocains du Canada told the Globe and Mail. \u201cHe helped and guided all the people who arrived here \u2013 students, families.\u201d A public funeral will be held on Thursday in a Montreal hockey arena for three of the men, including Khaled Belkacemi, 60, a professor in the food science department at Laval University, and Aboubaker Thabti, 44, a Tunisian-born father of two. The ceremony will also honour Abdelkrim Hassane, 41, an information technology worker for the government and father of two young children who waited in vain for him to come home on Sunday night. On Wednesday, relatives of Mamadou Tanou Barry, 42, told the Associated Press in Guinea of a project he had launched to bring drinking water to the remote village where he grew up. His close friend Ibrahima Barry, 39, also from Guinea and who lived in the same building, was also killed in the shooting. The two leave behind six children between then.",

Kate Purchase, the director of communications for the prime minister\u2019s office, sent a letter to Fox News objecting to misinformation it had put out after the attack on the Qu\u00e9bec City Islamic cultural center. Six people were fatally shot in the back as they prayed at the mosque on Sunday. Another 19 people were wounded. On Tuesday two people remained in critical condition.

It is the Queen\u2019s invitation. The fact that the invitation was given within the first days of President Trump arriving in the White House, apparently to happen in the first few months of his presidency, means that is comes much faster than it has for previous US presidents.\u201d </p> <p>Ricketts, who was the chair of the royal visits committee, pointed out that Presidents Obama, Bush and Clinton were not given state visits until three years into their first terms. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>My concern is that ... clearly there is now a lot of controversy. If that continues then it seems to me then it does put the Queen in a difficult position. She would want to receive the President in a celebratory, warm, friendly visit. At the moment it looks quite controversial. </p> <p>I was personally surprised that an invitation was issued so quickly. It does put the Queen directly involved at this early stage. In this early turbulent period, when these controversial policies are being announced, we have now got a state visit invitation on the table. It would have been possible to have invited the president to come on an official visit, but without the full panoply, the full accolade of a state visit quite so quickly. </p> <p>I wouldn\u2019t suggest it [the invitation] should be withdrawn. I don\u2019t think the timing has yet been set, and what I suggested is that perhaps the timing of the state visit can now be put back a bit, until we are able to see the president in the sort of way we would want to do. </p> <p>The alternative is that we continue as we are. But if the current level of protest and opposition, then I do think the Queen is put in a difficult position.</p> <p>I\u2019m trying to suggest a way forward now. With large scale protests, with a million and half people signing this petition in two or three days. There is controversy around this. </p> <p>The other approach is to go ahead and hope that within a few months things will have calmed down and have a proper visit. At the moment that looks quite tricky.</p> <p>Once this invitation has been issued, then of course there should be a state visit, and I wouldn\u2019t be against that.

She should have simply resigned in protest, but instead she made it almost imperative for the president to fire her. She played into his hands, and this has caused a tremendous disarray in our government, but it has probably helped Donald Trump politically because here he is standing up to the attorney general, firing her, and cleaning the swamp. So he has won this round unfortunately.\u201d</p> <p>He added that Trump will have stored up resentment in the justice department by sacking Yates. He said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThere will be some people who are civil servants who will always resent the fact that the president fired the acting attorney general. So this will cause him some long term damage in his relations with the justice department, but President Trump doesn\u2019t think long term.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked about the legality of the travel ban, Dershowitz, said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cI think parts of it are unlawful parts of it are lawful. I think it is all wrong, all bad policy, but there is an enormous difference between a ban on green card holders, which is illegal, and denying a visa to someone who has no prior connection to the United States.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>He also called on \u201cprincipled Republicans\u201d to stand up to Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s going to have to garner their support, and he\u2019s doing a very bad job of that up to now.\u201d</p> <p>Dershowitz said the prospect of impeachment is \u201coff the table\u201d.

However, what some cable networks are calling \u201cthe Monday night massacre\u201d doesn\u2019t quite measure up to that notorious night in the Nixon administration.</p> <p>The Saturday Night Massacre occurred after Richard Nixon ordered the then attorney general Elliot Richardson to fire Archibald Cox, the special prosecutor who was investigating Watergate. Cox had subpoenaed Nixon for taped conversations of the then president in the Oval Office and Nixon did not want to comply.</p> <p>Richardson, who previously served as secretary of health, education and welfare and then defense secretary in Nixon\u2019s cabinet, was a traditional Yankee Republican who was pillar of the Massachusetts GOP. A former supreme court clerk and decorated war hero, Richardson had previously served in statewide elected office in Massachusetts.

The order has now been challenged in a number of jurisdictions. As the Acting Attorney General, it is my ultimate responsibility to determine the position of the Department of Justice in these actions.</p> <p>My role is different from that of the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC), which, through administrations of both parties, has reviewed Executive Orders for form and legality before they are issued. OLC\u2019s review is limited to the narrow question of whether, in OLC\u2019s view, a proposed Executive Order is lawful on its face and properly drafted. Its review does not take account of statements made by an administration or it surrogates close in time to the issuance of an Executive Order that may bear on the order\u2019s purpose. And importantly, it does not address whether any policy choice embodied in an Executive Order is wise or just.</p> <p>Similarly, in litigation, DOJ Civil Division lawyers are charged with advancing reasonable legal arguments that can be made supporting an Executive Order. But my role as leader of this institution is different and broader. My responsibility is to ensure that the position of the Department of Justice is not only legally defensible, but is informed by our best view of what the law is after consideration of all the facts. In addition, I am responsible for ensuring that the positions we take in court remain consistent with this institution\u2019s solemn obligation to always seek justice and stand for what is right. <strong>At present, I am not convinced that the defense of the Executive Order is consistent with these responsibilities nor am I convinced that the Executive Order is lawful.</strong></p> <p>Consequently, for as long as I am the Acting Attorney General, <strong>the Department of Justice will not present arguments in defense of the Executive Order, unless and until I become convinced that it is appropriate to do so.</strong></p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-01-31T00:47:56.059Z\">at 12.47am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-588fd6f0e4b0f1550c0da9b7\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-31T00:18:16.678Z\">12.18am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">872 refugees will come to US this week under waivers</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Reuters reports that \u2013 despite the executive order banning all refugees from entering the US for 120 days \u2013 hundreds of refugees will be permitted to come to America this week:</p> <blockquote> <p>The US government has granted waivers to let 872 refugees into the country this week, despite President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order on Friday temporarily banning entry of refugees from any country, according to an internal department of homeland security document seen by Reuters. </p> <p>A homeland security official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed the waivers, noting that the refugees were considered \u201cin transit\u201d and had already been cleared for resettlement before the ban took effect.</p> <p>Refugees preparing for resettlement typically have severed personal ties and relinquished their possessions, leaving them particularly vulnerable if their plans to depart are suddenly cancelled. </p> <p>It was not known if additional waivers would be granted, the official said.

          "bodyText": "Here\u2019s a roundup of the latest developments: Donald Trump shows no sign of backing down in the row over his decision to impose a travel ban on seven Muslim majority countries. In his latest tweets he mocked Democratic party opposition to the ban, and urged Congress to approve more of his cabinet nominations. On Monday night Trump fired Sally Yates, the acting attorney general after she advised justice department lawyers not to defend a travel ban she considered to be \u201cnot lawful\u201d. In an extraordinary statement announcing her dismissal, the White House said Yates had \u201cbetrayed the department of justice\u201d. Yates was immediately replaced by Dana Boente, whose first act was to undo her last act. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic minority leader in the Senate, said news of Yates\u2019 sacking was \u201cchilling\u201d. European Union President Donald Tusk has warned European leaders about Trump\u2019s \u201cworrying declarations\u201d. In a letter to EU leaders Tusk included the new man in the White House as one of the threats to the geopolitical outlook. Lord Ricketts, the former Foreign Office permanent secretary, has called for a delay of up to three years on Trump\u2019s planned state visit to the UK, to save the Queen embarrassment. He said: \u201cIf you did it two or three years into the Trump presidency the controversial early policy announcements would have been out of the way.\u201d The UN\u2019s refugee agency says 800 refugees will be denied entry to USA this week and 20,000 people will be left in precarious circumstances by the ban. UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said he is \u201cdeeply worried by the uncertainty facing thousands of refugees\u201d because of the ban. Thousands of people gathered across the UK to protest against Trump\u2019s travel ban and his planned UK state visit. About 10,000 people were thought to have marched on Downing Street in London. 20 February was set as the date for MPs to debate a petition against Trump\u2019s visit that has garnered 1.6m signatures. MPs unanimously passed a motion condemning the \u201cdiscriminatory, divisive and counterproductive\u201d travel ban. The emergency debate was called by former Labour leader Ed Miliband and Conservative MP Nadhim Zahawi, who was born in Baghdad and risked being banned from the US. Former president Barack Obama has spoken out against Trump\u2019s travel ban. Obama\u2019s spokesman, Kevin Lewis, said: \u201cCitizens exercising their constitutional right to assemble, organise and have their voices heard by their elected officials is exactly what we expect to see when American values are at stake.\u201d MPs will next month debate whether Donald Trump should be allowed to make a state visit to Britain, after a petition calling for the trip to be downgraded gained the support of more than 1.6 million people. The Westminster Hall debate on 20 February will also consider a rival petition in support of Trump\u2019s state visit, which has more than 114,000 signatures, the Petitions Committee said. The firing of acting attorney general Sally Yates is one of doubtless many crisis points that will show us just how robust American democracy really is, argues Mary Dejevsky. While it exposes some of the weakness of the US system, it also highlights some of its strengths. There are real constraints on presidential power; a US president cannot rule by decree. But each president is free to test those limits. And the people, by choosing to protest or acquiesce, have a role, too. Trump is forcing the United States to define itself; to decide anew what is acceptable and what not. That feels dangerous. But it also feels exhilarating, and it is not necessarily a bad thing. Jennifer Rankin in Brussels has more on Tusk\u2019s concerns about Trump. One of the EU\u2019s top leaders has criticised Donald Trump for his \u201cworrying declarations\u201d and said the new administration in Washington is contributing to the dangers facing Europe. Donald Tusk, the head of the European council, said the \u201cworrying declarations by the new American administration... make our future highly unpredictable\u201d. In a letter to EU leaders [pdf], he included the new man in the White House with a threatening geopolitical outlook that also includes an \u201cassertive China\u201d, \u201caggressive Russia\u201d, radical Islam and \u201cwars, terror and anarchy in the Middle East and Africa\u201d. The former Polish president said Europe had never faced such threats since six countries embarked on the integration project sixty years ago, by signing a declaration in the Italian capital. \u201cThe challenges currently facing the European Union are more dangerous than ever before in the time since the signature of the Treaty of Rome.\u201d As well as a new and unpredictable world order, Tusk listed two other challenges: a rise in anti-EU sentiment and the \u201cstate of mind of the pro-European elites\u201d. In a striking passage he blamed elites for \u201ca decline of faith in political integration, submission to populist arguments as well as doubt in the fundamental values of liberal democracy\u201d. Tusk was writing to 27 EU leaders - excluding Britain\u2019s Theresa May - ahead of a summit in Valletta on Friday to debate the future, as the EU prepares to mark the 60th anniversary of its founding in Rome at the end of March. The British prime minister will be in the Maltese capital to take part in discussions on the migration crisis on Friday, but is not invited to a second session on the future of the EU. Tusk urged the EU to show it was united at the Rome anniversary summit, which falls just days before the deadline May has imposed on herself for triggering Britain\u2019s EU exit process. The letter from Tusk appeared to be a response to Trump rather than Brexit, but arguably he had a message for both US critics of EU integration and Brexiters dreaming of taking back control. \u201cIt must be made crystal clear that the disintegration of the European Union will not lead to the restoration of some mythical, full sovereignty of its member states, but to their real and factual dependence on the great superpowers: the United States, Russia and China,\u201d he wrote. \u201cOnly together can we be fully independent\u201d. Former MEP Glenys Kinnock has just tweeted a Trump demo selfie featuring her husband Neil, the former Labour leader, and the actor Michael Kashman. Prince Charles has made another veiled pop at Trump. Yates\u2019s defiance over the travel ban has highlighted Trump\u2019s tenuous relationship with his own national security advisers, officials have told the AP. At least three top national security officials \u2014 Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly and Rex Tillerson, who is awaiting confirmation to lead the State Department \u2014 have told associates they were not aware of details of the directive until around the time Trump signed it. Leading intelligence officials were also left largely in the dark, according to US officials. Mattis, who stood next to Trump during Friday\u2019s signing ceremony, is said to be particularly incensed. A senior US official said Mattis, along with Joint Chiefs Chairman Joseph Dunford, was aware of the general concept of Trump\u2019s order but not the details. Tillerson has told the president\u2019s political advisers that he was baffled over not being consulted on the substance of the order. US officials and others with knowledge of the Cabinet\u2019s thinking insisted on anonymity in order to disclose the officials\u2019 private views. Despite his public defense of the policy, the president has privately acknowledged flaws in the rollout, according to a person with knowledge of his thinking. Homeland Security, the agency tasked with implementing much of the refugee ban, clarified that customs and border agents should allow legal residents to enter the country. The Pentagon was trying to exempt Iraqis who worked alongside the U.S. and coalition forces from the 90-day ban on entry from the predominantly Muslim countries. \u201cThere are a number of people in Iraq who have worked for us in a partnership role, whether fighting alongside us or working as translators, often doing so at great peril to themselves,\u201d said Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman. European Union President Donald Tusk has warned European leaders about Trump\u2019s \u201cworrying declarations.\u201d In a letter to 27 EU leaders [pdf], Tusk mentioned the Trump administration as part of an external \u201cthreat\u201d together with China, Russia, radical Islam, war and terror. The letter was not sent to Britain as it embarks on the process of leaving the EU. Tusk said those global challenges, \u201cas well as worrying declarations by the new American administration, all make our future highly unpredictable.\u201d He said that \u201cparticularly the change in Washington puts the European Union in a difficult situation; with the new administration seeming to put into question the last 70 years of American foreign policy.\u201d The row over Trump\u2019s state visit highlights the irrelevance and impotence of the Queen, according to campaigners for an elected head of state. Graham Smith, chief executive of Republic, said: \u201cThe Queen should be embarrassed by the Trump visit - she is unable and unwilling to speak out against the Muslim ban. The state visit highlights just how impotent and irrelevant she is.\u201d \u201cThe Queen serves no practical purpose as head of state. She does as she\u2019s told by the prime minister and stays silent at times of crisis.\u201d \u201cRight now we could do with an elected, effective head of state who is independent from the PM. Someone who can represent and articulate the feelings of millions of British people.\u201d \u201cAn effective head of state would condemn the Muslim ban, and refuse the government\u2019s request for a state visit. Britain\u2019s head of state simply does the bidding of the PM, no questions asked.\u201d \u201cPeople will say the Queen is required by the constitution to stay mute. But that\u2019s exactly why we need a new constitution and a new head of state.\u201d Theresa May\u2019s hasty decision to invite Trump on a state visit was partly prompted by a desire to out manoeuvre Nigel Farage, writes Patrick Wintour. The government had been blindsided by Trump\u2019s victory, and Farage, the eternal thorn in the side of the Conservative leadership, was taunting the Foreign Office about his proximity to Trump and his chief strategist, Steve Bannon. The photograph of Farage beaming in the gilded Trump Towers was a humiliation for British officials, as was his one-hour meeting with Trump, which made him the first British politician to meet the president-elect ... A source who has discussed the invitation with a cabinet minister said: \u201cThe government has decided that their secret weapon to get in with Trump is to offer him an early visit to the Queen, him and [his wife] Melania staying at Windsor Castle.\u201d Another cabinet source said: \u201cThe Queen is the key here. She\u2019s not a secret weapon, she\u2019s the biggest public weapon you have. Nigel Faragecan\u2019t get [Trump] in front of the Queen.\u201d The invitation looks like a mistaken act of over-compensation, an effort to make sure the UK, an early backmarker, reverted to its traditional position of primus inter pares, the Special One. Since it was leaving EU, the UK simply could not afford to lose traction in Washington, and with so much flux in Trump\u2019s thinking, Downing Street decided to throw everything it had at its disposal to retain influence with the Republicans. Here\u2019s a gallery of anti-Trump placards from last night\u2019s demo: The petition backing the planned state visit by Trump has just topped 100,000. The anti visit petition has more than 1.66 million signatories. The planned state visit to Britain by Trump is months away and any programme has yet to be worked out, a Downing Street spokeswomman told Reuters. It quoted her saying: \u201cThe prime minister set out very clearly last night ... (that) the invitation has been extended. She was happy to do that. She looks forward to hosting the president and that will be a state visit this year.\u201d \u201cOn the programme for the state visit, that will all need to be worked out in due course ... It is months away.\u201d No word on whether the visit will be delayed as suggested by Lord Ricketts, the former permanent secretary at the Foreign Office. Donald Trump\u2019s top trade adviser has accused Germany of using a \u201cgrossly undervalued\u201d euro to exploit the US and its EU partners, the FT reports. Peter Navarro, the head of Trump\u2019s new National Trade Council, also accused Germany of being a major hurdle to a trade deal between the US and Europe. He is quoted as saying: A big obstacle to viewing TTIP [Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership] as a bilateral deal is Germany, which continues to exploit other countries in the EU as well as the US with an \u2018implicit Deutsche Mark\u2019 that is grossly undervalued. Before he entered office, Trump called Angela Merkel\u2019s open door policy to refugees a \u201ccatastrophic mistake\u201d, while Germany has expressed regret over the travel ban. Irish prime minister Enda Kenny today has ordered a complete review of the US Homeland Security controlled \u201cpre-clearance\u201d at Ireland\u2019s two main airports in response to growing opposition in the Republic to the Trump travel ban. Ireland is one of only six countries that allows American Homeland Security officials to vet travellers before they fly out to the United States. The taoiseach said: In respect of the policy introduced by the American government I disagree with. I will obviously say that to the president and vice president when I meet with them... I have asked for a complete review now of the pre-clearance facilities here in Ireland in respect of the three departments dealing with this. So we can be absolutely clear about the importance of it. Last night the Irish Department of Transport confirmed that one traveller was turned away at the gate to transatlantic flights in Dublin Airport. Kenny will face calls today in cabinet from independent deputies who serve in his coalition government to suspend Homeland Security\u2019s right to screen transatlantic passengers at Dublin and Shannon Airport until the Trump ban is lifted. The children\u2019s minister, Katherine Zappone, has written to the taoiseach ahead of the cabinet meeting in Dublin later on Tuesday warning Kenny that the travel ban may be unlawful to operate at Irish airports. Zappone said that the US-Ireland pre-clearance agreement upholds the rights of people under Irish law. At present any traveller booked on a flight to the United States from Ireland is processed through US immigration in Dublin or Shannon before they board their flight or arrive in the United States. British bishops have have decried the travel ban as un-Christian: The Archbishop of York, Dr John Sentamu, said: It is extraordinary that any civilised country should stigmatise and ban citizens of other nations in the matter of providing humanitarian protection. There is a valid question as to whether Christians, Yazidis and other religious minorities in the Middle East have so far had adequate access to such protection. However a blanket ban on any individual group is bound to undermine the fundamental principles of asylum. In Christ, we are called to welcome the stranger especially when in desperate need. The Bishop of Liverpool, the Rt Revd Paul Bayes, said: I am deeply disappointed by this way of governing. Signing executive orders of this nature is an unseemly way for the leader of the free world to conduct his nation\u2019s business. The US will not be made safer if hurting and displaced people are ignored or rejected. As a Christian I find it impossible to square this behaviour with the values of the Gospel. I urge President Trump\u2019s administration to follow Christ\u2019s example and to welcome the stranger. If the planned state visit does ahead the Queen won\u2019t say a word against Trump. But contrast her neutral stance with her opposition number in Belgium. King Philip delivered an outspoken attack on both Brexit and Trump\u2019s election in his annual address, De Standaard reports. Without mentioning either country by name, the prince said that the US and Britain have decided to focus mainly on their own policies. \u201cThis is contrary to their tradition of openness and generosity,\u201d said King Philip. \u201cThe year 2016 we will be forever remembered as the year when two great friendly countries decided henceforth to pay particular attention to themselves and their policies\u2019, said King Philip. \u201cWe will not succeed in restoring confidence by turning back the clock, from a kind of utopian nostalgic thought. Nor by erecting walls,\u201d he warned. Petition watch: The number of signatories against the planned state visit is now at more than 1.65 million. The rival petition backing the planned state visit has just topped 90,000. And more than 70 MPs have signed an early day motion calling on the Speaker to prevent President Trump addressing Parliament. In his second tweet of the day, Trump expressed frustration at the delay to the confirmation of Jeff Sessions as his nomination for attorney general. Senator Sessions, an anti-immigration lawyer from Alabama, is thought to be one of the architects of the travel ban. Here\u2019s a roundup of the latest fallout from President Trump\u2019s travel ban on seven Muslim majority nations: Lord Ricketts, the former Foreign Office permanent secretary, has called for a delay of up to three years on Trump\u2019s planned state visit to the UK, to save the Queen embarrassment. He said: \u201cIf you did it two or three years into the Trump presidency the controversial early policy announcements would have been out of the way.\u201d The UN\u2019s refugee agency says 800 refugees will be denied entry to USA this week and 20,000 people will be left in precarious circumstances by the ban. UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said he is \u201cdeeply worried by the uncertainty facing thousands of refugees\u201d because of the ban. Donald Trump fired Sally Yates, the acting attorney general after she advised justice department lawyers not to defend a travel ban she considered to be \u201cnot lawful\u201d. In an extraordinary statement announcing her dismissal, the White House said Yates had \u201cbetrayed the department of justice\u201d. Yates was immediately replaced by Dana Boente, whose first act was to undo her last act. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic minority leader in the Senate, said news of Yates\u2019 sacking was \u201cchilling\u201d. Thousands of people gathered across the UK to protest against Trump\u2019s travel ban and his planned UK state visit. About 10,000 people were thought to have marched on Downing Street in London. MPs unanimously passed a motion condemning the \u201cdiscriminatory, divisive and counterproductive\u201d travel ban. The emergency debate was called by former Labour leader Ed Miliband and Conservative MP Nadhim Zahawi, who was born in Baghdad and risked being banned from the US. Former president Barack Obama has spoken out against Trump\u2019s travel ban. Obama\u2019s spokesman, Kevin Lewis, said: \u201cCitizens exercising their constitutional right to assemble, organise and have their voices heard by their elected officials is exactly what we expect to see when American values are at stake.\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s has fired off his first tweet of the day to mock Democrats\u2019 opposition to the travel ban. On Monday night, Chuck Schumer, the Democratic minority leader in the Senate, said news of Sally Yates\u2019 sacking was \u201cchilling\u201d, pointing out that the attorney general\u2019s duty is to the law and the constitution, rather than to the president. Guardian Music has more on Bruce Springsteen speaking out against the ban (see earlier). The UN\u2019s refugee agency says 800 refugees will be denied entry to USA this week and 20,000 people will be left in precarious circumstances by Trump\u2019s 120 day refugee ban. UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said he is \u201cdeeply worried by the uncertainty facing thousands of refugees around the world who are in the process of being resettled to the United States\u201d. In a statement the UNHCR said: This week alone, over 800 refugees were set to make America their new home, but instead find themselves barred from travelling to the US. UNHCR estimates that 20,000 refugees in precarious circumstances might have been resettled to the United States during the 120 days covered by the suspension announced Friday, based on average monthly figures for the last 15 years. Refugees are anxious, confused and heartbroken at this suspension in what is already a lengthy process. For decades, the United States has been a global leader in refugee protection, a tradition rooted in the tolerance and generosity of the American people. UNHCR hopes the US will continue its strong leadership role and its long history of protecting those who are fleeing conflict and persecution. The High Commissioner underlines once again UNHCR\u2019s position that refugees should receive equal treatment for protection and assistance, and opportunities for resettlement, regardless of their religion, nationality or race. The prospect of the Queen\u2019s discomfort at Trump\u2019s visit has been a gift for cartoonists. The Guardian\u2019s Steve Bell imagines her screaming in horror whiling sitting in a state carriage with Trump. The Times\u2019s Morten Morland reckons the Queen could be tempted to build a wall to prevent Trump coming, while Prince Charles adds his name to the online petition against the visit. And here\u2019s Morland on Trump\u2019s battle with his justice department. Amazon chief executive, Jeff Bezos, has pledged the full legal resources of his company to fight the travel ban, writes Alex Hern. In an email to employees sent on Monday afternoon, Bezos said that Amazon would be putting its legal and lobbying efforts behind the fight against the ban. A key avenue of opposition involves supporting the attorney general for Washington state, where Amazon is headquartered, in his lawsuit against Trump \u2013the first confirmed legal action from a state against one of the new administration\u2019s policies. In an excerpt from Bezos\u2019s email published by Recode, the Amazon head details some of the company\u2019s intended actions: \u201cWe reached out to congressional leaders on both sides of the aisle to explore legislative options. Our legal team has prepared a declaration of support for the Washington state attorney general who will be filing suit against the order. We are working other legal options as well.\u201d Shadow business secretary Clive Lewis urged Theresa May to stop appeasing Trump. In a speech to last night\u2019s rally in Westminster, published by the Huffington Post, Lewis also tried to tie the issue to the tricky byelection Labour is facing in Stoke. \u201cNowhere does it say Donald Trump has the right to undermine our human rights. Because an attack on one, be they Muslim, Mexican or gay, is an attack on all of us. \u201cSo, Theresa May, listen up! \u201cWe the British people are telling you stop with the appeasement. Stop indulging a racist, torture-supporting, woman-hating, crypto fascist. Stop him from coming to this country until he lifts the ban on Muslims.\u201d That\u2019s because the EU referendum result did not give you a mandate to sell out on our British values. Did not give you permission to sell our NHS to Donald Trump and his corporate cronies. Did not give you permission to rip us away from our brothers and sisters in Europe and into the arms of Trump\u2019s America. \u201cMy final plea is this. It\u2019s a plea to all the decent people of Stoke. Its clear the Tories have pulled back in Stoke to give Paul Nuttall of Ukip a clear run at Labour. \u201cIn Richmond, progressive voters kicked out Zac Goldsmith - a man who conducted an outrageous racist mayoral campaign. They collectively kicked him out. \u201cNow I urge the progressive voters of Stoke to support the Labour candidate and stop the politics of Trump from coming to Westminster. Here\u2019s one we missed yesterday ... Bruce Springsteen added his voice to those protesting against the Muslim ban. At a concert in Adelaide he said the ban was \u201canti-democratic and fundamentally unAmerican.\u201d The Queen can take a state visit from Trump in her stride, according to former foreign secretary William Hague. Writing in the Telegraph he says: \u201cA Queen who has been asked over the decades to host tyrants such as Presidents Mobuto of Zaire and Ceausescu of Romania is going to take a brash billionaire from New York effortlessly in her stride ... State visits, if properly conducted, are about long-term friendship between nations, and all the links of the business, scientific, academic and diplomatic worlds. They give an incentive to both sides to make agreements to their mutual benefit \u2013 and the UK has never needed that more than now as we pull out of the EU. Most of us do not warm to Donald Trump or agree with the policies of his first 10 days. We can still, however, believe that our government should be the one he is most likely to listen to, and that Americans of all persuasions are among our closest friends. That means that when we ask the president to visit, we don\u2019t rescind the invitation.\u201d Labour MP Louise Haigh is concerned that all this talk of making it difficult for the Queen misses a bigger point. Pro Brexit Tory MP Andrew Bridgen has suggested that the state visit invitation to Trump has boosted the UK\u2019s prospects of a trade deal with the US. Defending the invitation on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Bridgen said: \u201cWe do need a good relationship with the Americans.\u201d And alluding to President Obama\u2019s warning about the UK going to the back of the queue if it voted for Brexit, Bridgen said: \u201cWith President Trump we have gone from the back of the queue to the front of the queue with regard to a free trade deal.\u201d Bridgen pointed out that no date had yet been set for the state visit. \u201cHe has enacted a temporary travel ban for 90 days. I would suspect that any date for his visit will be long after the travel ban has expired and new security arrangements are in place.\u201d Asked if he thought the visit would be delayed, Bridgen said: \u201cAnything is possible and diplomacy is very flexible ... \u201cHe\u2019ll have advisers around him, advising him of the right time to come to the UK. It won\u2019t be in the next 90 days, but I think it will be in next six month.\u201d Lord Ricketts, the former Foreign Office permanent secretary, has suggested delaying Trump\u2019s state visit by up to three years to save the Queen embarrassment. Expanding on his letter to the Times, Lord Ricketts, criticised the government for being too hasty in inviting Trump on a state visit. Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme he said: \u201cIf you did it two or three years into the Trump presidency the controversial early policy announcements would have been out of the way, things would have settled down and then hopefully we could receive the president in that sort of warm celebrating spirit that you want to do with a state visit.\u201d He added: \u201cThe point about a state visit is that it directly involves the Queen in a very personal way. It is the Queen\u2019s invitation. The fact that the invitation was given within the first days of President Trump arriving in the White House, apparently to happen in the first few months of his presidency, means that is comes much faster than it has for previous US presidents.\u201d Ricketts, who was the chair of the royal visits committee, pointed out that Presidents Obama, Bush and Clinton were not given state visits until three years into their first terms. He said: My concern is that ... clearly there is now a lot of controversy. If that continues then it seems to me then it does put the Queen in a difficult position. She would want to receive the President in a celebratory, warm, friendly visit. At the moment it looks quite controversial. I was personally surprised that an invitation was issued so quickly. It does put the Queen directly involved at this early stage. In this early turbulent period, when these controversial policies are being announced, we have now got a state visit invitation on the table. It would have been possible to have invited the president to come on an official visit, but without the full panoply, the full accolade of a state visit quite so quickly. I wouldn\u2019t suggest it [the invitation] should be withdrawn. I don\u2019t think the timing has yet been set, and what I suggested is that perhaps the timing of the state visit can now be put back a bit, until we are able to see the president in the sort of way we would want to do. The alternative is that we continue as we are. But if the current level of protest and opposition, then I do think the Queen is put in a difficult position. I\u2019m trying to suggest a way forward now. With large scale protests, with a million and half people signing this petition in two or three days. There is controversy around this. The other approach is to go ahead and hope that within a few months things will have calmed down and have a proper visit. At the moment that looks quite tricky. Once this invitation has been issued, then of course there should be a state visit, and I wouldn\u2019t be against that. But Guardian columnist Owen Jones spoke to some of the thousands of protesters who gathered outside Downing Street on Monday night to demonstrate against Trump\u2019s travel ban. Alan Dershowitz, one of the most outspoken lawyers in the US, has criticised the way Sally Yates played into the hands of Donald Trump before he fired her. The Harvard law professor who was part of OJ Simpson\u2019s defence team, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that he thought Trump\u2019s travel ban is wrong and partly illegal. But he also rounded on the tactical mistakes made by Yates in the way she criticised the policy. Dershowitz said Yates \u201cshould not have ordered the justice department not to defend it [the travel ban]. She should have simply resigned in protest, but instead she made it almost imperative for the president to fire her. She played into his hands, and this has caused a tremendous disarray in our government, but it has probably helped Donald Trump politically because here he is standing up to the attorney general, firing her, and cleaning the swamp. So he has won this round unfortunately.\u201d He added that Trump will have stored up resentment in the justice department by sacking Yates. He said: \u201cThere will be some people who are civil servants who will always resent the fact that the president fired the acting attorney general. So this will cause him some long term damage in his relations with the justice department, but President Trump doesn\u2019t think long term.\u201d Asked about the legality of the travel ban, Dershowitz, said: \u201cI think parts of it are unlawful parts of it are lawful. I think it is all wrong, all bad policy, but there is an enormous difference between a ban on green card holders, which is illegal, and denying a visa to someone who has no prior connection to the United States.\u201d He also called on \u201cprincipled Republicans\u201d to stand up to Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s going to have to garner their support, and he\u2019s doing a very bad job of that up to now.\u201d Dershowitz said the prospect of impeachment is \u201coff the table\u201d. He explained: \u201cTo be impeached in the United States is very very difficult. You have to really commit a high crime or misdemeanour under the constitution. And no president has ever been impeached when he controls both the house and the senate.\u201d \u201cWhat he is going to try to do is govern through populism. We are a country in crisis. So much will depend on how responsible members of his own party respond to his excesses.\u201d On a turbulent Monday evening in Washington, Donald Trump fired Sally Yates, the acting attorney general who had advised justice department lawyers not to defend a travel ban she considered to be \u201cnot lawful\u201d. In a memorandum to staff, Yates \u2013 who was due to be in place until Jeff Sessions, Trump\u2019s pick for attorney general, is confirmed \u2013 wrote: At present, I am not convinced that the defense of the executive order is consistent with [my] responsibilities nor am I convinced that the executive order is lawful. Consequently, for as long as I am the acting attorney general, the department of justice will not present arguments in defense of the executive order, unless and until I become convinced that it is appropriate to do so. You can read the full letter here. In an extraordinary statement announcing her dismissal, the White House said Yates had \u201cbetrayed the department of justice\u201d, adding: Ms Yates is an Obama administration appointee who is weak on borders and very weak on illegal immigration. You can read the full statement here. Yates was immediately replaced by Dana Boente, whose first act was to undo her last act: I hereby rescind former acting attorney general Sally Q Yates January 30, 2017, guidance and direct the men and women of the department of justice to do our sworn duty and to defend the lawful orders of our president. You can read that full statement here. Video footage has surfaced of Yates\u2019s confirmation hearing in 2015 (as deputy attorney general) in which Sessions \u2013 who faces a hearing of his own this week \u2013 quizzed her on fidelity to the law v fidelity to the president: Sessions: Do you think the attorney general has a responsibility to say no to the president if he asks for something that\u2019s improper? \u2026 If the views the president wants to execute are unlawful, should the attorney general or the deputy attorney general say no? Yates: Senator, I believe the attorney general or the deputy attorney general has an obligation to follow the law and the constitution, and to give their independent legal advice to the president. The Trump administration also removed the acting director of US immigration and customs enforcement (Ice), Daniel Ragsdale, late on Monday night without explanation. Newly appointed homeland security secretary John Kelly said Thomas Homan would take up the role in a statement that made no mention of Ragsdale. Ice later confirmed he would remain deputy director of the agency. As a UK petition against the planned state visit by Donald Trump \u201cbecause it would cause embarrassment to Her Majesty the Queen\u201d tops 1.6 million signatures, there are signs that the possible royal embarrassment might be the issue that gives 10 Downing Street pause for thought. Here\u2019s the front page of Tuesday\u2019s Times: In a letter to the newspaper, Lord Ricketts, who was permanent secretary at the UK foreign office from 2006-10 before becoming then prime minister David Cameron\u2019s national security adviser, said the offer so early in Trump\u2019s presidency was \u201cpremature\u201d and put the Queen in a \u201cvery difficult position\u201d, Press Association reports. Ricketts said it was unprecedented for a US president to be given a state visit in their first year in the White House and questioned whether Mr Trump was \u201cspecially deserving of this exceptional honour\u201d: It would have been far wiser to wait to see what sort of president he would turn out to be before advising the Queen to invite him. Now the Queen is put in a very difficult position. Who is Sally Yates, now no longer acting attorney general? A career justice department attorney, she was the deputy attorney general in the Obama administration. The Trump team had asked her to stay on to allow for a cohesive transition, even as the other senior leadership of the justice department departed. Yates, 56, from Atlanta, Georgia, was the lead prosecutor in the case against Olympic bomber Eric Rudolph. She received bipartisan praise when she was appointed to the number two spot below Loretta Lynch at the justice department in 2015. The Republican Senator Johnny Isakson of Georgia said of her: \u201cSally Quillian Yates is a human being I have known for almost 40 years. For 25 years she has been the lead prosecutor in the northern district of Georgia. \u201cShe has been an equal opportunity prosecutor. She\u2019s prosecuted Democrats, Republicans, independents, Olympic park bombers, anybody that violated the public trust, any abuse of power.\u201d His fellow Republican, David Perdue, said of Yates: \u201cI\u2019m confident that she will bring an objective, apolitical approach to the justice department.\u201d Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer has praised the actions of former acting attorney general Sally Yates after she was fired by Donald Trump for saying his travel ban was not lawful: It was a profile in courage. It was a brave act and a right act \u2026 How can you run a country like this? Patrick Leahy, ranking member of the Senate judiciary committee, has criticised the firing of Sally Yates \u2013 and the White House wording of her dismissal: Federal courts have already found President Trump\u2019s immigration order is very likely unconstitutional, and tonight, acting attorney general Yates concluded that it was not legally defensible. She was fired for recognising that her oath is to the constitution and not to President Trump. His accusation that she has \u2018betrayed the department of justice\u2019 is wrong and it is dangerous. President Trump has now put his cabinet on notice: if you adhere to your oath of office to defend the constitution, you risk your job. Equally troubling is that his nominee for attorney general, Senator Jeff Sessions, has shown no indication that he has the independence to put the constitution before the president. The Senate at its best can be the conscience of the nation. Senators must oppose Senator Sessions. The Mexican president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, has spoken to the Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau, Mexico\u2019s government has said. It said the pair spoke by phone on Monday and agreed to strengthen ties: Both leaders agreed to keep in close contact and intensify their teams\u2019 work to speed up the integration of a stronger and more prosperous North America. The statement said Pe\u00f1a Nieto \u201creiterated the will of the Mexican government to continue reinforcing ties \u2026 between the two peoples\u201d. The new US president has threatened to leave Nafta (the North American Free Trade Agreement) if Mexico and Canada will not renegotiate it. A meeting last week between Trump and Pe\u00f1a Nieto was cancelled after Mexico once again insisted it would not pay for the US president\u2019s proposed border wall. This is a great find. Here\u2019s Sally Yates at her confirmation hearing in 2015 for her then role as deputy attorney general. She\u2019s asked by Jeff Sessions \u2013 yes, that Jeff Sessions, who is now Trump\u2019s nominee for attorney general \u2013 whether she could say no to a president who wanted to do something unlawful. Here\u2019s part of the exchange: Sessions: Do you think the attorney general has a responsibility to say no to the president if he asks for something that\u2019s improper? \u2026 If the views the president wants to execute are unlawful, should the attorney general or the deputy attorney general say no? Yates: Senator, I believe the attorney general or the deputy attorney general has an obligation to follow the law and the constitution, and to give their independent legal advice to the president. The first act of new acting attorney general Dana Boente is to undo the last act of the previous acting attorney general Sally Yates. In a statement, Boente said: On January 30, 2017, Acting Attorney General Sally Q. Yates issued a memorandum barring Department of Justice Attorney\u2019s [sic] from presenting arguments in defense of the President\u2019s January 27, 2017, Executive Order entitled \u201cProtecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States\u201d. At approximately 9.00pm I was asked by the President to serve in the capacity of Acting Attorney General. After having dedicated the last thirty-three years of my life to this Department, I am humbled and incredibly honored to serve as Acting Attorney General. Based upon the Office of Legal Counsel\u2019s analysis, which found the Executive Order both lawful on its face and properly drafted, I hereby rescind former Acting Attorney General Sally Q. Yates January 30, 2017, guidance and direct the men and women of the Department of Justice to do our sworn duty and to defend the lawful orders of our President. The new acting attorney general, Dana Boente, has immediately overruled the advice of the previous (now fired) acting attorney general Sally Yates that the president\u2019s travel ban was not lawful and should not be defended. Justice department lawyers must now defend the order. The Trump administration replaced the acting director of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement [Ice] just after firing the acting US attorney general as the backlash over the president\u2019s controversial travel ban continues to grow. Daniel Ragsdale, the acting Ice director who had served under the Obama administration as the agency\u2019s deputy director since 2012, was removed from the acting director role late on Monday night without public explanation. In a brief statement, Trump\u2019s newly appointed homeland security secretary John Kelly said Ragsdale would be replaced by Thomas Homan, formerly the executive associate director of Ice\u2019s enforcement and removal operations [ERO] division. Homan has served in the agency since its creation in 2003, and in the ERO division, which oversees deportations, since 2009. \u201cI look forward to working alongside him to ensure that we enforce our immigration laws in the interior of the United States consistent with the national interest,\u201d Kelly, a former Marine Corps general, said. Shortly after Kelly\u2019s statement, which made no mention of Ragsdale, Ice confirmed he would remain deputy director of the agency. Last week the Trump administration vastly expanded the powers of the agency, by broadening immigration enforcement priorities through an executive order. Ice agents are now able to target almost any of American\u2019s 11 million undocumented migrants for deportation. Under the order, the agency can target undocumented migrants convicted of minor crimes, those who have only been accused of crimes, and those whom individual agency deem a threat to public safety or national security. On a turbulent night, more confusion: ICE acting director Daniel Ragsdale has not been fired, the department of homeland security says, contrary to earlier reports. Ragsdale has been replaced as acting director but apparently returns to his role as ICE deputy director. The new acting director is Thomas Homan. Already commentators are comparing Sally Yates\u2019s firing to the so-called Saturday Night Massacre of 1973. However, what some cable networks are calling \u201cthe Monday night massacre\u201d doesn\u2019t quite measure up to that notorious night in the Nixon administration. The Saturday Night Massacre occurred after Richard Nixon ordered the then attorney general Elliot Richardson to fire Archibald Cox, the special prosecutor who was investigating Watergate. Cox had subpoenaed Nixon for taped conversations of the then president in the Oval Office and Nixon did not want to comply. Richardson, who previously served as secretary of health, education and welfare and then defense secretary in Nixon\u2019s cabinet, was a traditional Yankee Republican who was pillar of the Massachusetts GOP. A former supreme court clerk and decorated war hero, Richardson had previously served in statewide elected office in Massachusetts. But when Nixon ordered him to fire Cox, Richardson refused and resigned in protest. He was following in doing so by William Ruckelshaus, his deputy, who had previously served as the first administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Eventually solicitor general Robert Bork, who was next in line, fired Cox. The Saturday Night Massacre was a defining moment in the Watergate scandal. The president fired two highly respected Republican officials and demonstrated that he had something to hide from the American people. In contrast, Yates is a temporary holdover from the Obama administration who was simply serving until Trump\u2019s nominee for attorney general could be confirmed. Further, unlike Cox, who was a special prosecutor and supposed to be protected from dismissal without cause, Yates could be fired at any time. The shock on Monday night is not that Yates was fired from a job that she was unlikely to hold for any longer for the remainder of the week after putting herself in direct opposition to the president. Instead, it\u2019s as much the tone of the White House statement which accused her of \u201cbetray[ing] the department of justice\u201d and derides her as \u201cweak on borders and very weak on illegal immigration\u201d. This isn\u2019t a remake of All the President\u2019s Men. Instead, it\u2019s simply that the American government has now become yet another episode of The Apprentice. Here\u2019s Republican Senator Ted Cruz, who thinks it \u201cfitting\u201d that \u201cafter eight long years of a lawless Obama department of justice\u201d Sally Yates has \u201cforce[d] the president to fire her\u201d: The acting director of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Daniel Ragsdale, has been replaced. A statement from the department of homeland security announces Thomas Homan as the new acting director \u2013 but doesn\u2019t mention Ragsdale at all. No reason for the change is given. [This post was edited at 11.25pm ET to clarify that, according to the DHS, Ragsdale has not been fired. He has been replaced by Homan as acting director but apparently returns to his role as deputy director.] In a sign of the turbulent waters in which Trump is swimming, it is unclear if the new acting attorney general can sign national security surveillance requests. According to the seminal Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the central pillar of domestic national security surveillance law, only the attorney general, deputy attorney general or designated assistant attorney general for national security may sign off on surveillance requests submitted to the secret Fisa court. But the attorney general and deputy attorney general require Senate confirmation. The assistant attorney general for national security\u2019s designation requires approval by the attorney general. (The justice department\u2019s national security division is currently run by an interim appointee.) Although the new acting attorney general Dana Boente was confirmed by the Senate as a US attorney in Virginia, it is an unsettled question whether his current interim role gives him sufficient powers for the sensitive surveillance requests. Mike German, an FBI counterterrorism agent and surveillance law expert, said the Boente appointment had created an \u201cunprecedented\u201d situation for surveillance law, but thought that the Fisa court was unlikely to stand in the way of a surveillance request. \u201cThe Fisa court doesn\u2019t have a long history of finding reasons to reject [requests], and if it were to err here, it\u2019d be on the side of authorizing the new acting attorney general to sign the warrants,\u201d German said. The White House indicated to pool reporters it believes Boente would possess the requisite surveillance authority. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic minority leader in the Senate, says news of Yates\u2019 sacking is \u201cchilling\u201d, pointing out that the attorney general\u2019s duty is to the law and the constitution, rather than to the president: Nancy Pelosi, Democratic leader in the house, says Trump fired Yates \u201cto get the answer he wants\u201d on the legality of his travel ban: Tonight, the acting attorney general was fired for upholding the constitution of the United States. What the Trump administration calls betrayal is an American with the courage to say that the law and the constitution come first. President Trump\u2019s executive order violates the constitution, dishonors our values, and weakens the security of the United States. National security experts are warning that the president\u2019s ban will make it harder, not easier to defeat terror. Earlier tonight, House Republicans blocked Democrats\u2019 emergency bill to rescind this dangerous and unconstitutional executive order. Now, President Trump has fired the acting attorney general to get the answer he wants. Republicans will have to decide whether they will be complicit in the President\u2019s reckless, wrathful and unconstitutional agenda. Some support for Trump from former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, who labels Yates \u201cinsubordinate\u201d for her judgment that the president\u2019s executive order was not lawful: Sally Yates found out she had been fired via \u201ca hand-delivered letter from the White House\u2019s office of personnel\u201d, the Wall Street Journal reports. Dana Boente has already been sworn in as acting attorney general, the White House confirms, at 9pm ET. The White House said he is now authorised to sign foreign surveillance warrants (Yates was previously the only person who could do so). Boente would not have been the automatic next-in-line to Yates, some have pointed out: Political reaction to Trump\u2019s sacking of Sally Yates is coming in: (In 1973, in the so-called \u201cSaturday night massacre\u201d, Richard Nixon fired his attorney general and deputy attorney general over their refusal to oust the Watergate prosecutor.) Matt Zapotosky of the Washington Post says Dana Boente, the new acting attorney general, has already confirmed to him that he will reverse Yates\u2019 position and tell justice department lawyers to defend the travel ban: The acting Attorney General, Sally Yates, has betrayed the Department of Justice by refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United States. This order was approved as to form and legality by the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel. Ms. Yates is an Obama Administration appointee who is weak on borders and very weak on illegal immigration. It is time to get serious about protecting our country. Calling for tougher vetting for individuals travelling from seven dangerous places is not extreme. It is reasonable and necessary to protect our country. Tonight, President Trump relieved Ms. Yates of her duties and subsequently named Dana Boente, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, to serve as Acting Attorney General until Senator Jeff Sessions is finally confirmed by the Senate, where he is being wrongly held up by Democrat senators for strictly political reasons. \u201cI am honored to serve President Trump in this role until Senator Sessions is confirmed. I will defend and enforce the laws of our country to ensure that our people and our nation are protected,\u201d said Dana Boente, Acting Attorney General. The new acting attorney general \u2013 until Trump\u2019s nominee, Jeff Sessions, is confirmed \u2013 will be Dana Boente, US attorney for the eastern district of Virginia, the White House says. The office of White House press secretary Sean Spicer has issued a statement saying that Sally Yates has been \u201crelieved \u2026 of her duties\u201d as acting attorney general: Donald Trump might still be plugging away on Twitter now he\u2019s in office, but at least one of his appointees with similarly eyebrow-raising tweet tendencies now appears to have gone offline. General Michael Flynn, national security adviser to the president and formerly tweeting at @GenFlynn, seems to have deleted his account. CNN has a roundup of Flynn\u2019s more controversial tweets, including one from February 2016 in which he declared: Fear of Muslims is RATIONAL. Flynn also had to apologise last year after retweeting an antisemitic comment. The internal department of homeland security document seen by Reuters has some figures on the numbers of people already directly affected by the travel ban. Between late Friday and early Monday, it said: 348 visa holders were prevented from boarding US-bound flights. More than 200 people landed in the US but were denied entry. More than 735 people were taken aside for questioning by customs and border protection officers in US airports. 394 of those were legal permanent US residents holding green cards. China cautiously weighed in on Donald Trump\u2019s controversial ban on travellers from seven Muslim-majority countries, saying \u201creasonable concerns\u201d must be taken into account. \u201cChina believes that adjusting immigration and entry and exit policy is an act within each country\u2019s sovereignty,\u201d China\u2019s foreign ministry said in a statement sent to Reuters. \u201cAt the same time, relevant moves must also consider the reasonable concerns of relevant countries.\u201d The statement didn\u2019t elaborate beyond that vague language. China often says it is inappropriate for countries to \u201ccomment on the internal affairs of others\u201d, in an attempt to deflect frequent criticisms of its own affairs by the US and Europe. But as China works to take a greater role in global diplomacy, especially in the Middle East, it is having to rethink this long-held stance. Sudan and Iran are both close allies of China, and were both targeted in the Trump executive order. And while China does not deny entry to entire countries, the government heavily restricts international travel based on ethnicity of its own citizens, particularly Muslim Uighurs and Tibetans. Democrats have been protesting outside the supreme court on Monday evening against Trump\u2019s travel ban. (Separately, on Tuesday evening, the president is set to announce his nomination for the vacant seat on the supreme court. Barack Obama nominated Merrick Garland in March last year, an appointment that was blocked by Republicans.) Tom Perez, one of the contenders for DNC chair, has come out fighting for Sally Yates: For nearly three decades, acting attorney general Sally Yates has served presidents of both parties, defending the constitution and holding terrorists and other criminals accountable. Acting attorney general Yates\u2019s record is simply beyond reproach \u2013 that\u2019s why she was confirmed with strong bi-partisan support. The fact is that acting attorney general Yates, and every law enforcement official and credible attorney, knows Trump\u2019s Muslim ban is illegal. The acting attorney general is standing up to this dangerous executive order that goes against everything we stand for as a country and only puts more American lives at risk. We\u2019re fortunate to have such dedicated public servants across the federal government who are committed to doing the right thing. Her independence and commitment to upholding the constitution is exactly what our country lacks if the Senate confirms Sen. Jeff Sessions. We\u2019ve got to fight like hell to prevent that from happening. Trump has \u2013 of course \u2013 hopped on to Twitter to respond to the move by Sally Yates, acting attorney general (and an Obama nominee who\u2019s in post until Trump\u2019s own pick, Jeff Sessions is confirmed), who has instructed justice department lawyers not to defend the president\u2019s travel ban. I had assumed there was a follow-up tweet coming, but 25 minutes later am concluding that this might be it: Associated Press says the man Trump has cited as a source for his unsubstantiated claim that millions of people voted illegally in the election is himself registered to vote in three states: A man who President Donald Trump has promoted as an authority on voter fraud was registered to vote in multiple states during the 2016 presidential election, the Associated Press has learned. Gregg Phillips, whose unsubstantiated claim that the election was marred by 3 million illegal votes was tweeted by the president, was listed on the rolls in Alabama, Texas and Mississippi, according to voting records and election officials in those states. He voted only in Alabama in November, records show. Trump has made an issue of people who are registered to vote in more than one state, using it as one of the bedrocks of his overall contention that voter fraud is rampant in the US and that voting by 3 to 5 million immigrants illegally in the country cost him the popular vote in November. The AP found that Phillips was registered in Alabama and Texas under the name Gregg Allen Phillips, with the identical social security number. Mississippi records list him under the name Gregg A. Phillips, and that record includes the final four digits of Phillips\u2019 social security number, his correct date of birth and a prior address matching one once attached to Gregg Allen Phillips. He has lived in all three states. At the time of November\u2019s presidential election, Phillips\u2019 status was \u201cinactive\u201d in Mississippi and suspended in Texas. Officials in both states told the AP that Phillips could have voted, however, by producing identification and updating his address at the polls. Thousands of people have gathered across the UK to protest against Donald Trump\u2019s travel ban targeting seven Muslim-majority countries, his indefinite bar on Syrian refugees and his planned UK state visit. About 10,000 people were thought to have marched on Downing Street in London, with the crowd stretching the length of Whitehall by 7pm. Edinburgh, Cardiff, Manchester and Birmingham also had large demonstrations. Protesters showed their anger on the day that a petition calling for the US president\u2019s state visit to the UK to be axed passed 1.5m signatures. Also on Monday night MPs unanimously passed a motion condemning the \u201cdiscriminatory, divisive and counterproductive\u201d travel ban, after an emergency debate called by former Labour leader Ed Miliband and Conservative MP Nadhim Zahawi, who was born in Baghdad and risked being banned from the US. (UK officials have since advised that UK dual nationals will not be affected, but this remains unclear.) Here is the full letter from Sally Yates, acting attorney general, to justice department lawyers (bolding for emphasis is mine): On January 27, 2017, the President signed an Executive Order regarding immigrants and refugees from certain Muslim-majority countries. The order has now been challenged in a number of jurisdictions. As the Acting Attorney General, it is my ultimate responsibility to determine the position of the Department of Justice in these actions. My role is different from that of the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC), which, through administrations of both parties, has reviewed Executive Orders for form and legality before they are issued. OLC\u2019s review is limited to the narrow question of whether, in OLC\u2019s view, a proposed Executive Order is lawful on its face and properly drafted. Its review does not take account of statements made by an administration or it surrogates close in time to the issuance of an Executive Order that may bear on the order\u2019s purpose. And importantly, it does not address whether any policy choice embodied in an Executive Order is wise or just. Similarly, in litigation, DOJ Civil Division lawyers are charged with advancing reasonable legal arguments that can be made supporting an Executive Order. But my role as leader of this institution is different and broader. My responsibility is to ensure that the position of the Department of Justice is not only legally defensible, but is informed by our best view of what the law is after consideration of all the facts. In addition, I am responsible for ensuring that the positions we take in court remain consistent with this institution\u2019s solemn obligation to always seek justice and stand for what is right. At present, I am not convinced that the defense of the Executive Order is consistent with these responsibilities nor am I convinced that the Executive Order is lawful. Consequently, for as long as I am the Acting Attorney General, the Department of Justice will not present arguments in defense of the Executive Order, unless and until I become convinced that it is appropriate to do so. Reuters reports that \u2013 despite the executive order banning all refugees from entering the US for 120 days \u2013 hundreds of refugees will be permitted to come to America this week: The US government has granted waivers to let 872 refugees into the country this week, despite President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order on Friday temporarily banning entry of refugees from any country, according to an internal department of homeland security document seen by Reuters. A homeland security official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed the waivers, noting that the refugees were considered \u201cin transit\u201d and had already been cleared for resettlement before the ban took effect. Refugees preparing for resettlement typically have severed personal ties and relinquished their possessions, leaving them particularly vulnerable if their plans to depart are suddenly cancelled. It was not known if additional waivers would be granted, the official said. The document did not give the nationalities of the refugees. The 872 refugees to be admitted this week, under the waivers, were screened using Obama administration procedures, which typically take two years and include several interviews and a background check. Before news broke of the instruction by the acting attorney general that justice department lawyers will not defend Trump\u2019s travel ban, a number of legal challenges had already been made to the executive order. Over the weekend, federal judges in four states ordered that no one who was en route or had reached the US with a valid visa or green card at the time the executive order was signed could be deported. They did not decide whether Trump\u2019s measures \u2013 to suspend travel from seven Muslim-majority countries for 90 days; to suspend the Syrian refugee program indefinitely; to suspend all refugee admissions for 120 days; and to prioritize refugees of minority \u2013 were constitutional. Rulings were made in New York, Massachusetts, Virginia and Washington, each of which differed slightly. Attorney generals in New York and Washington state have already called the executive order unconstitutional. In the New York court on Saturday night, government lawyers defending the case were visibly unsure what to say. Attorney Susan Riley told the court: This has unfolded with such speed that we haven\u2019t had an opportunity to address the issues, the important legal issues. More from the letter sent by acting attorney general Sally Yates to justice department lawyers, according to a report in the New York Times, which has seen the letter: For as long as I am the acting attorney general, the department of justice will not present arguments in defense of the executive order, unless and until I become convinced that it is appropriate to do so. Yates is acting attorney general only until Trump\u2019s own pick, Jeff Sessions, is confirmed. Trump does have the power to fire Yates ahead of that moment. CNN is reporting that Sally Yates, acting attorney general, has advised justice department lawyers not to defend Trump\u2019s travel ban. According to CNN, Yates \u2013 who is an Obama appointee in the role until Trump\u2019s nominee, Jeff Sessions, is approved \u2013 \u201cdoes not believe the substance of the order is lawful\u201d. The New York Times also reports from a letter reportedly sent by Yates to justice department lawyers: I am responsible for ensuring that the positions we take in court remain consistent with this institution\u2019s solemn obligation to always seek justice and stand for what is right. At present, I am not convinced that the defense of the executive order is consistent with these responsibilities nor am I convinced that the executive order is lawful. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic minority leader in the Senate, steps up now. The order will make us unsafe, the order will make us inhumane and the order will make us less American. The nations of the world will no longer look up to us \u2026 We will fight this with everything we have and we will win this fight. Right now, Democrats are holding a protest against Trump\u2019s travel ban on the steps of the supreme court. They want the president to rescind the executive order. Nancy Pelosi, the house minority leader, says: What the president did undermines our values. What the president did is not constitutional \u2026 In the view of many of us, it is immoral. Pelosi says the move is \u201creckless and rash\u201d. Former president Barack Obama \u2013 remember him? \u2013 has spoken out against Donald Trump\u2019s controversial travel ban, with a spokesman saying he was \u201cheartened\u201d by protests against the executive order and that he fundamentally disagrees with the notion of discriminating against individuals because of their faith or religion. A draft memo circulating among US diplomats said the ban would make the US less safe from terrorism, and stands in opposition to the core American and constitutional values that we, as federal employees, took an oath to uphold. The Council on American\u2013Islamic Relations (Cair) has issued a lawsuit claiming the ban violates the first amendment of the constitution, which establishes the right to freedom of religion. Thousands of people across the UK joined protests against the travel ban, marching in London, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Manchester and other cities. The UN high commissioner for refugees Filippo Grandi said he was \u201cdeeply worried\u201d about the executive order, which halts all refugees admissions for 120 days and suspends Syrian refugees indefinitely: Refugees are anxious, confused and heartbroken at this suspension in what is already a lengthy process. But the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, said the ban was \u201cabout the safety of America\u201d: I think it\u2019s a shame that people were inconvenienced, obviously, but at the end of the day we\u2019re talking about a couple of hours. Being able to come to America is a privilege, not a right. Find more in Tom McCarthy\u2019s daily roundup here. Imraan Siddiqi, the head of CAIR Arizona and one of the activists involved in the CAIR legal suit against Trump\u2019s executive order, tweeted about the lawsuit: The UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi is \u201cdeeply worried\u201d about Trump\u2019s travel ban executive order, which halts all refugees admissions for 120 days and suspends Syrian refugees indefinitely. In a statement, Grandi noted that 800 refugees due to arrive in the United States this week are now barred from entry. \u201cUNHCR estimates that 20,000 refugees in precarious circumstances might have been resettled to the United States during the 120 days covered by the suspension announced Friday, based on average monthly figures for the last 15 years. Refugees are anxious, confused and heartbroken at this suspension in what is already a lengthy process,\u201d reads the statement. Last year 96,874 refugees resettled in the United States, with 15,479 of them coming from Syria, according to US state department figures. But Trump\u2019s decision affects the US\u2019s global standing, said Grandi: For decades, the United States has been a global leader in refugee protection, a tradition rooted in the tolerance and generosity of the American people. UNHCR hopes the US will continue its strong leadership role and its long history of protecting those who are fleeing conflict and persecution. The Council on American\u2010Islamic Relations launched legal action against Donald Trump and his executive order travel ban in the eastern district court of Virginia today, calling The lead plaintiff of the case is Linda Sarsour, the executive director of Arab American Association of New York and an organizer of the Women\u2019s March on Washington on January 21. The plaintiffs, a high-profile group of Muslim activists, lawyers and politicians, call it an \u201cunconstitutional order\u201d by a president who has led a campaign to fuel fear and discrimination against Muslims and that the order is \u201ca legal manifestation of those bigoted views\u201d. The legal complaint reads: President Trump\u2019s Muslim Exclusion Order imposes upon Islam\u2014the religion to which all of the Plaintiffs belong\u2014the stigma of government disfavor. This condemnation, which has been cast to the general public pursuant to the Muslim Exclusion Order, signals to Plaintiffs\u2019 fellow citizens that their faith is uniquely threatening and dangerous insofar as it is the only religion singled out for disfavored treatment. Sarsour, a Palestinian-American who was born in Brooklyn, also led protests at JFK airport and in Battery Park over the weekend against the travel ban. A reporter asks about the 300 people around the world awaiting to board planes to the US and were not allowed because of the travel ban. Spicer dodges the question. Spicer again speaking about the travel ban. \u201cThis is about the safety of America. This is why the majority of Americans agree with the president... these steps are frankly common sense steps to make sure we\u2019re never looking at the rear-view mirror asking \u2018we should have done something\u2019\u201d, says Spicer. Does Trump have anything to say to protesters and those who the travel ban affects, a reporter asks. \u201cI think it\u2019s a shame that people were inconvenienced, obviously, but at the end of the day we\u2019re talking about a couple of hours,\u201d says Spicer, saying he\u2019d rather people had to wait at airports than encounter terrorism. \u201cBeing able to come to America is a privilege, not a right,\u201d says Spicer. \u201cWe have to wait in lines too,\u201d says Spicer. When quizzed if other countries would be added to the list of seven, Spicer says: \u201cWe don\u2019t have to look at the families of the Boston marathon, the San Bernardino, to ask if we can go further. He adds that it\u2019s possible extra countries will be added to the list. He\u2019s back! A statement from Barack Obama about the mass rallies of people protesting around the country all weekend over Trump\u2019s travel ban executive order. Journalists quiz Sean Spicer about legal action being taken against Trump\u2019s executive order. Spicer mentions the Brooklyn federal court decision on Saturday evening, and adds: \u201cWe won\u2019t have to prevail in that case, it doesn\u2019t make any sense. It\u2019s about people being deported. The process was never about that.\u201d Spicer says that in a 24-hour period over the weekend, 109 were stopped for additional screening out of 325,000, a number he saw as minor. \u201cThe majority of Americans agree with the president. They recognize the steps he\u2019s taken,\u201d he says. Journalists note that the Brooklyn federal court is just one of four federal court actions that have already ruled against parts of the order, but Spicer says he\u2019s not concerned. \u201cI don\u2019t think any of the others are pertaining... all of the forces and actions protecting the order are in place now... I feel confident,\u201d says Spicer. Spicer is asked about the travel ban affecting seven Muslim-majority countries and whether it is more extreme than any action from the Obama administration. \u201cWe\u2019ve going to put the safety of Americans first ... We\u2019re not going to wait until we get attacked and figure out how it\u2019s going to happen again,\u201d says Spicer. \u201cThat\u2019s the key point in this: how do we keep ahead of threats?\u201d adds Spicer. \u201cThat\u2019s what the president has done... putting America\u2019s safety and security first and foremost,\u201d says Spicer. \u201cHis view is not to wait to get ahead of the curve ... we don\u2019t know when that hour comes, we don\u2019t know when the individual comes to do us harm.\u201d Spicer says this morning\u2019s executive order about regulation will help small business. But he makes no mention of the travel ban before heading to questions from the press. Spicer talks about how Trump is concerned about Isis and terrorism, and the \u201cthe United States must take decisive action and the president is taking the right steps.\u201d He mentions the calls that Trump has taken with foreign leaders, including Middle Eastern leaders, over the weekend. \u201cNotably he did all this in the face of supreme obstructionism from Democrats in the Senate,\u201d, says Spicer, saying 17 nominees still await confirmation. \u201cThese cabinet members are all unbelievably qualified and will all be confirmed by the Senate, and Democrats know this,\u201d says Spicer. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of misreporting this week about what this memo does and does not do,\u201d says Sean Spicer, referring to the changes made by Trump to the National Security Council, where controversial advisor Steve Bannon is now on the panel and the director of intelligence and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff will not always attend the principals committee. \u201cThis idea there\u2019s been a change or a downgrade is utter nonsense,\u201d says Bannon. Spicer says they called several outlets \u201cwho had been misreporting this memo to explain what it means\u201d yesterday. Trump will now amend the memo to add the CIA into the memo, says Spicer, saying that the Obama administration had not included the CIA. Sean Spicer starts off his press briefing by saying Trump has spoken with Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau to give his condolences over the shooting at a Quebec mosque where six people were killed. Spicer notes that the \u201ctragic\u201d event is a reminder \u201cwhy the president is taking steps to be proactive rather than reactive when it comes to keeping citizens safe.\u201d That\u2019s presumably a reference to Trump\u2019s executive order banning travel to citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries. The Governor of Washington, Jay Inslee, announced on Monday his state was launching a legal challenge against Trump\u2019s travel ban executive order, the first state to do so. \u201cThe judicial system is adept at protecting the constitution. President Trump may have his alternative facts, but alternative facts do not work in a courtroom,\u201d said Inslee, as he announced the lawsuit with state Attorney General Bob Ferguson, in a press conference shown on Facebook live. \u201cThis is real hope that this outrage will not stand... we\u2019ve already seen the president retreat on the green-card holder issue... This is not over, people need to have hope,\u201d he said. Inslee noted that since September 11, 2001 there have been 700,000 refugees admitted to the Untied States, there was not one single fatality from a crime by a refugee from any of the seven Muslim-majority countries as part of the ban. \u201cThat is a fact. And facts tend to become somewhat relevant in a courtroom, even if they aren\u2019t in reality TV,\u201d said Inslee. He said the classification of banning immigrants based their country of citizenship goes against state statutes to stop discrimination based on place of birth or nationality. When asked about Trump\u2019s power to make immigration decisions in his role as president, Ferguson said: \u201cI understand that is their argument. But those powers are not without limit... we are confident that our lawsuit exposes those limits and makes it clear he is acting beyond those limits\u201d. Coming up at 1:30pm ET is a briefing from Sean Spicer, White House press secretary. There\u2019s been a large number of protests against the travel ban arranged in the UK today, including evening events towns and cities as far aparts as Aberdeen, Brighton, Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Dundee, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Leeds, Leicester, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, Sheffield and York. Here are some photos from the protests taken by Guardian colleagues reporting on them in Wales and in Manchester. From Guardian reporter Frances Perraudin in Manchester: The crowd is gathering in Manchester\u2019s Albert Square outside the city\u2019s town hall. Over 2,600 people have said they will attend tonight\u2019s demonstration against Donald Trump\u2019s immigration directive. The site for the demonstration is a stone\u2019s throw from Lincoln Square, where a statue of US president Abraham Lincoln was erected to give thanks to Lancashire\u2019s cotton workers for \u201ctheir fight for the abolition of slavery during the American Civil War\u201d. (An economic blockade of slave-picked cotton from the southern states caused massive unemployment in the region\u2019s cotton industry.) Dean Smith, a 24-year-old sports journalist, is the main organiser of this evening\u2019s demo. Smith says it was a tweet by the writer David Slack that prompted him to act on his horror at Trump\u2019s directive. The tweet reads: \u201cRemember sitting in history, thinking \u2018If I was alive then, I would\u2019ve\u2026\u2019 You\u2019re alive now. Whatever you\u2019re doing is what you would\u2019ve done.\u201d Donald Trump on Monday said he was happy with the imposition of a travel ban on Muslim-majority nations. \u201cWe actually had a very good day yesterday in terms of homeland security and someday we were hoping to move and we decided to make a move,\u201d Trump told reporters while meeting with small business owners at the White House. Over the weekend a Facebook post by data scientist Nazanin Zinouri, who is Iranian and lives in South Carolina, went viral after Zinouri wrote about being unallowed to return to the US because of the travel ban, although she has an apartment, job, friends, dog and life here. She expanded on her post in an article in the Washington Post, discussing her experience after being banned from boarding a flight in Dubai to the United States: A million thoughts rushed through my mind, from the practical to the philosophical: What happens to Dexter [her dog] now? He is waiting for his mom to come home. Who is going to take him for doctor visits? What happens to my car parked at the long-term lot at the Atlanta airport? What happens to all the stuff I had collected during 6\u00bd years living in the United States? What about my lease? Will my landlord think I just left town? What happens to my job, my life, my American Dream? I flew back to Tehran to stay with my family and figure out what to do next, stung by the realization that as far as the U.S. government is concerned, my life doesn\u2019t matter. Nothing I worked for all these years matters. Read the rest here. UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has insisted that the UK government has hammered out a new deal with Donald Trump\u2019s administration under which anyone carrying a British passport will not be banned from entering the US. The foreign secretary told parliament that further talks with senior figures inside the White House had secured a more detailed agreement that dual nationals would not be stopped, even if they were travelling from one of the seven countries covered by the US ban. Johnson made clear that the new US immigration policy, which he described as \u201chighly controversial\u201d, was not a measure that the British government would consider. Following talks between himself and the home secretary, Amber Rudd, and their US counterparts, he said: \u201cI\u2019m able to provide the following clarification. The general principle is that all British passport holders remain welcome to travel to the US. We have received assurances that this executive order will make no difference to any British passport holder irrespective of their country of birth or if they hold another passport.\u201d Read the rest here. Helena Smith, our correspondent in Greece, the county long on the frontline of the refugee crisis, reports on Syrians being the biggest victims of Trump\u2019s travel ban. The implications of the freeze may still be unclear but of one thing human rights groups are sure: Syrian refugees fleeing atrocity and war are among the biggest losers not least because the U.S. has resettled more Syrian refugees to date than any other country. \u201cWhat is very clear cut is that Syrian refugees have now lost one of their very few tickets out,\u201d Amnesty International\u2019s deputy director for Europe and Central Asia, Gauri Van Gulik, told the Guardian. \u201cThe U.S. has been the biggest re-settler country. For Syrians who had some hope of being resettled, that hope is now shut. It\u2019s a huge loss,\u201d said Van Gulik. Around 800,000 Syrians fled to Europe via Greece at the height of the conflict in 2015. The vast majority made their way further north until borders along the Balkan corridor were closed and thousands were subsequently stranded in Greece. Trump just signed another new executive order, this one on the theme of cutting regulation. The purpose of the order states that: for every one new regulation issued, at least two prior regulations be identified for elimination, and that the cost of planned regulations be prudently managed and controlled through a budgeting process. It\u2019s being done as a cost-cutting measure, although it\u2019s not yet clear the practicalities of cutting two regulations for every new regulation to be implemented. A \u201cDissent Channel\u201d memo slamming Trump\u2019s executive orders as \u201ccounter to core American values\u201d and saying the changes will instead aid terrorists is circulating amongst State Department staffers, reports the Washington Post. The memo, which is titled \u201cAlternatives to Closing Doors in Order to Secure Our Borders\u201d according to the draft published in the Washington Post, is being signed by State Department staff. Then, it will be sent officially through the Dissent Channel, a channel used to communicate dissenting opinions on government policy without fear of retribution. Trump\u2019s travel ban will \u201csour relations\u201d with the named countries and also others in the Muslim world, says the memo, noting that it will \u201cincrease anti-American sentiment\u201d. The memo also states the US will suffer economically and that there is a humanitarian responsibility to allow travel for needs such as medical needs or to attend funerals. \u201cLooking beyond its effectiveness, this ban stands in opposition to the core American and constitutional values that we, as federal employees, took an oath to uphold,\u201d it reads. Instead, the memo calls for wider vetting of people from all countries, including holders of US passports, not just the seven Muslim-majority countries named. Steve Herman, a diplomatic reporter reporter at Voice of America, published a statement from the State Department confirming the authenticity of the memo. Read the whole draft memo here. Live video of British MPs discussing the Trump administration and the Trump executive order. Coffee giant Starbucks announced overnight a promise to hire 10,000 refugees, in response to Trump\u2019s executive order travel ban. As Adam Vaughan and Dominic Rushe report: Howard Schultz, the coffee chain\u2019s chief executive, said he had \u201cdeep concern\u201d about the president\u2019s order and would be taking \u201cresolute\u201d action, starting with offering jobs to refugees. \u201cWe are developing plans to hire 10,000 of them over five years in the 75 countries around the world where Starbucks does business,\u201d he told employees in a strongly-worded note. He added that the move was to make clear the company \u201cwill neither stand by, nor stand silent, as the uncertainty around the new administration\u2019s actions grows with each passing day.\u201d Read the rest here. Syrian refugees in Rome have a message for the US president, as criticism grows over Donald Trump\u2019s freeze on America\u2019s refugee program. Good morning and welcome to our continuing coverage of the fallout from Donald Trump\u2019s executive order on refugee admission and travel from some Muslim-majority countries. After a weekend of mass protests and disruption - with people detained at airports, refused entry to planes and removed from the United States - legal challenges continue to be launched, challenging the validity of the order. \u201cWe have a constitutional crisis,\u201d Congressman Don Beyer, a Democrat from Virginia, wrote on Twitter on Sunday after Customs and Border Patrol officials refused to release people from Dulles Airport, despite federal court rulings that temporarily stayed the Trump order. Having government and public officials abide by the law and court orders is one of the hallmarks of the nation, notes Trevor Timm. Trump is standing by the ban and the decision to implement it immediately, with no warning: John Kelly, the new secretary for homeland security, released a statement clarifying that green-card holders, who are legal permanent US residents, will not be affected by the travel ban. Today, among other things, we\u2019ll be keeping our eye on Trump spokesman Sean Spicer\u2019s 1.30pm ET press briefing, where journalists will be likely quiz him on the ban and the administration\u2019s handling of it.",

Donald Trump can ban all the Muslims he wants; Justin Trudeau can welcome all the refugees he likes.</p> <p>But the truth is that white nationalist terrorists are as much of a threat to civilized society as their radical Islamist counterparts.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/23/thomas-mair-found-guilty-of-jo-cox-murder\">Thomas Mair</a> murdered Cox as she was campaigning to stay inside the European Union. \u201cBritain first,\u201d said the Nazi-loving white supremacist, as he brutally attacked the British MP and mother of two.</p> <p>Dylann Roof hoped to incite a race war when he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/15/dylann-roof-convicted-charleston-shooting\">fired</a> more than 70 bullets into a Bible study group that had welcomed him into the fellowship hall of Emanuel AME Church.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The neo-Nazi cult of death is no different from the jihadi cult of death</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Alexandre Bissonnette, charged with six counts of murder in a Qu\u00e9bec City mosque, is said to be well known to refugee groups for his frequent online insults about immigration and his admiration for Marine Le Pen, the leader of France\u2019s far-right Front National.</p> <p>Mair and Roof both found their sick inspiration in online communities of hatred and violence. It may be that Bissonnette did too.</p> <p>The great <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/mar/09/biography.artsandhumanities\">Primo Levi</a> would recognize what connects these men and what is happening to our culture. \u201cThe plague is over but the infection spreads: it would be foolish to deny it,\u201d he wrote, more than two decades after he left the Nazi concentration camps.</p> <p>The scientist survivor was clear about the source of the infection he observed in such clinical detail: \u201cMainly, at the root of it all, a tide of cowardice, an abysmal cowardice, masked as warrior virtue, love of country, and loyalty to an idea.\u201d</p> <p>It may be too much to ask the Trump White House to see Primo Levi\u2019s point. After all, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/30/sean-spicer-white-house-holocaust-critics-pathetic\">Trump\u2019s staff</a> could barely understand the point of International Holocaust Remembrance Day. It takes real determination to fumble a simple statement attesting to the extraordinary Jewish suffering at the hands of the Nazis. Saying you\u2019re very sad about the Shoah, or accusing your critics of being pathetic, merely serves to spread the infection.</p> <p>What does real leadership look like? If you\u2019re courageous enough to say the words \u201cradical Islamic terrorism\u201d, you could at least muster the strength to condemn its white nationalist copy. You could avoid hiring publishers who peddle far-right conspiracies, like Steve Bannon, to your inner circle. You might even think twice about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/30/steve-bannon-nsc-politics-national-security\">installing</a> them as permanent members of your national security council.</p> <p>The neo-Nazi cult of death is no different from the jihadi cult of death. If we want to defeat those who kill in the name of religion and race, we should have the good sense and self-discipline to resist joining their religious and racial wars.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>And if you really want to defeat Isis, you might find it useful to keep the highest-ranking military commander close by. Someone like the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff might prove to be a cooler head on questions of war and peace than the chairman of a website that is beloved by neo-Nazis.</p> <p>This is no time to be stoking the fires of intolerance, as the premier of Qu\u00e9bec, Philippe Couillard, explained. \u201cWe live in a world where people tend to divide themselves rather than unite. Our country, Canada and Qu\u00e9bec, has to remain a beacon of tolerance.\u201d</p> <p>That beacon of tolerance is still shining at the grassroots in the United States. After its mosque was mysteriously burned to the ground over the weekend, a small Muslim community in Victoria, Texas, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/30/us/texas-mosque-fund-raiser.html?module=WatchingPortal&amp;region=c-column-middle-span-region&amp;pgType=Homepage&amp;action=click&amp;mediaId=thumb_square&amp;state=standard&amp;contentPlacement=6&amp;version=internal&amp;contentCollection=www.nytimes.com&amp;contentId=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2017%2F01%2F30%2Fus%2Ftexas-mosque-fund-raiser.html&amp;eventName=Watching-article-click\">has raised </a>more than $900,000 online for its reconstruction. The founder of the mosque said local churches and a synagogue had offered space for the community to continue its prayers.</p> <p>These are the people Donald Trump should be listening to, much like the protesters who are filling the streets of America\u2019s cities, large and small.</p> <p>But if he won\u2019t listen to the people, he might as well listen to his most obvious predecessor. Because there is a model for his own redemption, and his name was George Wallace.</p> <p>Trump may have campaigned by vilifying Mexicans and Muslims, and he may have started his presidency the same way. But George Wallace campaigned with a similar tone and substance, and late in life, he renounced segregation and asked for forgiveness from African Americans.</p> <p>Trump could grow into his presidency by leading the far-right away from violence, condemning his KKK supporters and denouncing racist murderers. He could seek forgiveness from Muslim Americans by personally apologizing to the Iraqi interpreter who was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/28/us/iraqi-immigrant-donald-trump-airport-detention.html\">detained</a> for 19 hours at JFK airport despite having risked his life working for the 101st airborne division for a decade.</p> <p>But of course, he won\u2019t. Donald Trump is too weak, too foolish and too chaotic to see beyond the immediate crises he has created.</p> <p>How foolish is he? On Sunday night he issued a press statement insisting \u201cthis is not a Muslim ban\u201d and that he has \u201ctremendous feeling for the people involved in this horrific humanitarian crisis in Syria\u201d.</p> <p>By the next morning, he was tweeting something completely different. \u201cThis was a big part of my campaign,\u201d he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/826044059647107073\">explained</a>, quite possibly on his unsecured Android phone. \u201cIf the ban were announced with a one week notice, the \u2018bad\u2019 would rush into our country during that week. A lot of bad \u2018dudes\u2019 out there!\u201d</p> <p>Taken at his infantile word, Trump literally makes no sense: having campaigned on a Muslim ban, Trump now believes he has taken all those bad dudes by surprise with the same ban.</p> <p>As written by a nine-year-old boy, in an imaginary game of Ruler of the Free World, this might be mildly entertaining. But we\u2019re actually talking about a 70-year-old commander-in-chief, who is willing to fire dissenting officials, such as his <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/30/justice-department-trump-immigration-acting-attorney-general-sally-yates\">acting attorney general</a>, for defending the constitution instead of the Muslim ban.</p> <p>After just one week of the Trump presidency, this is the source of the infection that is rapidly spreading: an abysmal cowardice, masked as warrior virtue, love of country and loyalty to an idea.</p>",

          "bodyText": "One of them shot and stabbed to death Jo Cox. Another massacred nine churchgoers in Charleston. Then six Canadians were gunned down at evening prayers in Qu\u00e9bec City. It\u2019s long past time to recognize the mortal threats within our own borders. Donald Trump can ban all the Muslims he wants; Justin Trudeau can welcome all the refugees he likes. But the truth is that white nationalist terrorists are as much of a threat to civilized society as their radical Islamist counterparts. Thomas Mair murdered Cox as she was campaigning to stay inside the European Union. \u201cBritain first,\u201d said the Nazi-loving white supremacist, as he brutally attacked the British MP and mother of two. Dylann Roof hoped to incite a race war when he fired more than 70 bullets into a Bible study group that had welcomed him into the fellowship hall of Emanuel AME Church. Alexandre Bissonnette, charged with six counts of murder in a Qu\u00e9bec City mosque, is said to be well known to refugee groups for his frequent online insults about immigration and his admiration for Marine Le Pen, the leader of France\u2019s far-right Front National. Mair and Roof both found their sick inspiration in online communities of hatred and violence. It may be that Bissonnette did too. The great Primo Levi would recognize what connects these men and what is happening to our culture. \u201cThe plague is over but the infection spreads: it would be foolish to deny it,\u201d he wrote, more than two decades after he left the Nazi concentration camps. The scientist survivor was clear about the source of the infection he observed in such clinical detail: \u201cMainly, at the root of it all, a tide of cowardice, an abysmal cowardice, masked as warrior virtue, love of country, and loyalty to an idea.\u201d It may be too much to ask the Trump White House to see Primo Levi\u2019s point. After all, Trump\u2019s staff could barely understand the point of International Holocaust Remembrance Day. It takes real determination to fumble a simple statement attesting to the extraordinary Jewish suffering at the hands of the Nazis. Saying you\u2019re very sad about the Shoah, or accusing your critics of being pathetic, merely serves to spread the infection. What does real leadership look like? If you\u2019re courageous enough to say the words \u201cradical Islamic terrorism\u201d, you could at least muster the strength to condemn its white nationalist copy. You could avoid hiring publishers who peddle far-right conspiracies, like Steve Bannon, to your inner circle. You might even think twice about installing them as permanent members of your national security council. The neo-Nazi cult of death is no different from the jihadi cult of death. If we want to defeat those who kill in the name of religion and race, we should have the good sense and self-discipline to resist joining their religious and racial wars. And if you really want to defeat Isis, you might find it useful to keep the highest-ranking military commander close by. Someone like the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff might prove to be a cooler head on questions of war and peace than the chairman of a website that is beloved by neo-Nazis. This is no time to be stoking the fires of intolerance, as the premier of Qu\u00e9bec, Philippe Couillard, explained. \u201cWe live in a world where people tend to divide themselves rather than unite. Our country, Canada and Qu\u00e9bec, has to remain a beacon of tolerance.\u201d That beacon of tolerance is still shining at the grassroots in the United States. After its mosque was mysteriously burned to the ground over the weekend, a small Muslim community in Victoria, Texas, has raised more than $900,000 online for its reconstruction. The founder of the mosque said local churches and a synagogue had offered space for the community to continue its prayers. These are the people Donald Trump should be listening to, much like the protesters who are filling the streets of America\u2019s cities, large and small. But if he won\u2019t listen to the people, he might as well listen to his most obvious predecessor. Because there is a model for his own redemption, and his name was George Wallace. Trump may have campaigned by vilifying Mexicans and Muslims, and he may have started his presidency the same way. But George Wallace campaigned with a similar tone and substance, and late in life, he renounced segregation and asked for forgiveness from African Americans. Trump could grow into his presidency by leading the far-right away from violence, condemning his KKK supporters and denouncing racist murderers. He could seek forgiveness from Muslim Americans by personally apologizing to the Iraqi interpreter who was detained for 19 hours at JFK airport despite having risked his life working for the 101st airborne division for a decade. But of course, he won\u2019t. Donald Trump is too weak, too foolish and too chaotic to see beyond the immediate crises he has created. How foolish is he? On Sunday night he issued a press statement insisting \u201cthis is not a Muslim ban\u201d and that he has \u201ctremendous feeling for the people involved in this horrific humanitarian crisis in Syria\u201d. By the next morning, he was tweeting something completely different. \u201cThis was a big part of my campaign,\u201d he explained, quite possibly on his unsecured Android phone. \u201cIf the ban were announced with a one week notice, the \u2018bad\u2019 would rush into our country during that week. A lot of bad \u2018dudes\u2019 out there!\u201d Taken at his infantile word, Trump literally makes no sense: having campaigned on a Muslim ban, Trump now believes he has taken all those bad dudes by surprise with the same ban. As written by a nine-year-old boy, in an imaginary game of Ruler of the Free World, this might be mildly entertaining. But we\u2019re actually talking about a 70-year-old commander-in-chief, who is willing to fire dissenting officials, such as his acting attorney general, for defending the constitution instead of the Muslim ban. After just one week of the Trump presidency, this is the source of the infection that is rapidly spreading: an abysmal cowardice, masked as warrior virtue, love of country and loyalty to an idea.",

          "bodyText": "A 27-year-old university student has been charged with six counts of first-degree murder over a shooting at a Qu\u00e9bec City mosque during evening prayers, in what the Canadian prime minister described as an act of terror. Alexandre Bissonnette, a student in the social sciences faculty at Laval University, also faces five charges of attempted murder. Bissonnette did not enter a plea during a brief court appearance late on Monday. Wearing a white prisoner jump suit, his hands and feet shackled, he stared down at the floor and fidgeted, but remained silent. A local group dedicated to welcoming refugees, Bienvenu aux r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s, said Bissonnette\u2019s name was familiar to them, describing him as an online troll who had denigrated refugees and expressed support for Marine Le Pen, the leader of France\u2019s far-right Front National. In a Facebook post, the group said Bissonnette was \u201cunfortunately known by several militants in Qu\u00e9bec City for his viewpoints that were pro-LePen and anti-feminist, as expressed in social media and at the Universit\u00e9 Laval\u201d. Others who knew Bissonnette described him a timid introvert who was a staunch supporter of US president Donald Trump. \u201cHe loved Trump a lot and seemed to be permanently set against the left, \u00c9ric Debroise told the Journal de Qu\u00e9bec. He said he had reached out to police in the wake of the shooting to inform them that Bissonnette is \u201cfar right and an ultra nationalist white supremacist\u201d. Another classmate, Jean-Michel Allard Prus, described Bissonnette as someone with \u201cright-wing political ideas, pro-Israel, anti-immigration. I had many debates with him about Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was obviously pro-Trump.\u201d But Bissonnette had never broached the idea of violence as a political tool, he added. The charges came hours after the attack at the Qu\u00e9bec City Islamic cultural center, also known as the Grande Mosqu\u00e9e de Qu\u00e9bec, during evening prayers. Six people were killed and another 19 injured. Five people remain in critical condition in hospital. Police initially said two men had been arrested after the attack. But later in the day, provincial police clarified that only one was a suspect and they had released the other \u2013 considered to be a witness \u2013 without charges.

          "body": "<p>It was a tweet heard around the world: Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s rejoinder to Donald Trump\u2019s repugnant Muslim travel ban that has sparked outrage around the world. \u201cTo those fleeing persecution, terror &amp; war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith,\u201d Trudeau <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JustinTrudeau/status/825438460265762816?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">tweeted</a> on Saturday. \u201cDiversity is our strength. #WelcometoCanada.\u201d</p> <p>While Trump has immediately stoked reactionary chaos, Trudeau has always struck the progressive posture. With fuzzy memes and messaging and photo-ops of him hugging refugees \u2013 and his predictably popular latest tweet \u2013 Canada\u2019s Liberal party has painted themselves as a welcoming government in a sea of rising intolerance. Praise from the international political and media class has flowed. </p> <p>Trump\u2019s attack on refugees, and yesterday\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/30/quebec-city-mosque-shooting-alexandre-bissonnette-murder-charge\">murderous assault</a> on a Quebec city mosque by a racist white nationalist, should indeed focus Trudeau\u2019s mind. But before we continue the bout of self-congratulation, let\u2019s get a few things straight. Start with the fact that, despite the horror unfolding south of the border, his government refused yesterday to commit to raising the country\u2019s refugee intake: asked to clarify Trudeau\u2019s twitter-diplomacy, the Immigration Minister stated that they were already \u201cdoing our part.\u201d</p> <p>What exactly is our part? Just last month, the government quietly <a href=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2016/12/24/ottawas-new-cap-on-refugee-applications-upsets-sponsors.html\">capped</a> applications for private sponsorship of refugees from war-torn Syria and Iraq\u2014after families and community groups brought in nearly 14,000 last year. The number now accepted? A mere one thousand. In other words, many desperate and endangered people will not be able to come to Canada, despite there being groups ready to welcome and host them. Sparkling in his symbolism, Trudeau has been desultory in his deeds.</p> <p>Despite the optics, Canada has hardly been a leader in openness among countries. The number of refugees it accepted last year totalled 38,000\u2014<a href=\"http://globalnews.ca/news/2951263/these-14-countries-have-taken-more-refugees-than-canada/\">ranking</a> us a laggardly 20th, judged per capita, among industrialized countries. And of those refugees, nearly half were privately sponsored by citizens, not the government itself. Trudeau has outsourced his responsibility to ordinary people, but has not been shy to claim the benefits to his image.</p> <p>As Trump\u2019s administration now unleashes a racist anti-immigrant agenda that will involve not just travel bans by massive surveillance and deportations, there is another crucial way that Canada could open the doors to endangered people\u2014but is currently, under Trudeau, barring many of them. If an asylum seeker now in the United States showed up at the Canadian border tomorrow, they would not be welcomed: they might be turned away. Hard to square with Trudeau\u2019s tweet, isn\u2019t it?</p> <p>That\u2019s because Canada\u2014under a so-called Safe Third Country agreement established by a previous Liberal government in 2004\u2014doesn\u2019t accept asylum seekers who come to Canada via the US.

          "bodyText": "It was a tweet heard around the world: Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s rejoinder to Donald Trump\u2019s repugnant Muslim travel ban that has sparked outrage around the world. \u201cTo those fleeing persecution, terror &amp; war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith,\u201d Trudeau tweeted on Saturday. \u201cDiversity is our strength. #WelcometoCanada.\u201d While Trump has immediately stoked reactionary chaos, Trudeau has always struck the progressive posture. With fuzzy memes and messaging and photo-ops of him hugging refugees \u2013 and his predictably popular latest tweet \u2013 Canada\u2019s Liberal party has painted themselves as a welcoming government in a sea of rising intolerance. Praise from the international political and media class has flowed. Trump\u2019s attack on refugees, and yesterday\u2019s murderous assault on a Quebec city mosque by a racist white nationalist, should indeed focus Trudeau\u2019s mind. But before we continue the bout of self-congratulation, let\u2019s get a few things straight. Start with the fact that, despite the horror unfolding south of the border, his government refused yesterday to commit to raising the country\u2019s refugee intake: asked to clarify Trudeau\u2019s twitter-diplomacy, the Immigration Minister stated that they were already \u201cdoing our part.\u201d What exactly is our part? Just last month, the government quietly capped applications for private sponsorship of refugees from war-torn Syria and Iraq\u2014after families and community groups brought in nearly 14,000 last year. The number now accepted? A mere one thousand. In other words, many desperate and endangered people will not be able to come to Canada, despite there being groups ready to welcome and host them. Sparkling in his symbolism, Trudeau has been desultory in his deeds. Despite the optics, Canada has hardly been a leader in openness among countries. The number of refugees it accepted last year totalled 38,000\u2014ranking us a laggardly 20th, judged per capita, among industrialized countries. And of those refugees, nearly half were privately sponsored by citizens, not the government itself. Trudeau has outsourced his responsibility to ordinary people, but has not been shy to claim the benefits to his image. As Trump\u2019s administration now unleashes a racist anti-immigrant agenda that will involve not just travel bans by massive surveillance and deportations, there is another crucial way that Canada could open the doors to endangered people\u2014but is currently, under Trudeau, barring many of them. If an asylum seeker now in the United States showed up at the Canadian border tomorrow, they would not be welcomed: they might be turned away. Hard to square with Trudeau\u2019s tweet, isn\u2019t it? That\u2019s because Canada\u2014under a so-called Safe Third Country agreement established by a previous Liberal government in 2004\u2014doesn\u2019t accept asylum seekers who come to Canada via the US. If someone fleeing war or persecution lands first in the United States \u2013 deemed a \u201csafe country,\u201d a notion now dramatically unapt \u2013 they are barred from seeking refuge in Canada. There were already instances of people risking their lives to cross the border to Canada. And now life for poor, racialized and Muslim people in the United States has gotten a whole lot more dangerous. But Trudeau has not shown any inclination to repeal this agreement and allow people to find safety in Canada: a petition with growing numbers demands he now urgently do so. Trudeau appears to be very good at saying exactly the right thing, at the opportune media moment\u2014then doing very little to accompany it with meaningful action. If only virality could induce reality. Those many desperate people who have had their hopes raised by media coverage of Trudeau\u2019s proclamations should be warned: don\u2019t expect an embrace at the airport. Expect detention or deportation. And beyond the border, not stuffed animals but stuffed suits from Canada\u2019s security or spy agencies. Far from being a genuine haven for refugees, Canada under Trudeau has continued policies \u2013 dating back to the odious Conservative government of Stephen Harper or well before \u2013 that make life for refugees fleeing to this country exceedingly difficult and dangerous. Anyone deemed an \u201cirregular arrival\u201d to the country \u2013 as desperate people are bound to be \u2014 are immediately jailed. Several thousand people every year in Canada \u2013 including hundreds of children \u2013 wallow in indefinite detention in facilities or maximum security provincial prisons. As if fleeing persecution were a crime. Hunger strikes to protest conditions have been a regular occurrence: but instead of acceding to demands, the government has deported key strike organizers. These policies have been condemned by the United Nations\u2014not the kind of international attention that Trudeau is used to. And far out of the sight of ordinary Canadians, a bureaucratic machine operated by security officials has ripped apart families and deported, often to lethal situations, a staggering number of refugees or migrants: well over 100,000 people in the last decade. These policies are presided over by Trudeau with none of Trump\u2019s venom, but the result is still exclusion, suffering and heartbreak. This is not the violence of overt hate. It is the violence of empty gestures. We must demand so much more. For so long, the right-wing has been doing exactly that. Demagogic politicians in Canada have stoked anti-Muslim and anti-refugee sentiments with proposals for a \u201cbarbaric cultural practices hotline\u201d or screenings for \u201canti-Canadian values.\u201d This sowed the seeds for a gunmen\u2019s rampage on a mosque. It also meant that even when the right-wing lost particular policy goals - as Trump already appears to be on aspects of his Muslim ban \u2013 they still won another way: they dragged the political climate further to the right, making racism more acceptable and discriminatory policies more possible. It is time for progressive movements to match right-wing assertiveness, but in the service of compassion and solidarity. Pretty words will not suffice: we must demand significant policy changes and a firm rejection of anti-Muslim ideology\u2014including Trudeau outright condemning Trump\u2019s executive order. Heroic migrant justice groups like No One Is Illegal have already been setting out a bold vision: Canadians must now start to amplify them. Undocumented residents should be granted permanent status and live without fear of mass detention and deportation; and borders should be opened to those refused asylum in the United States and others living in danger elsewhere. Inspiring rallies at airports across the United States over the weekend were followed today by protests in Canada surrounding US consulates and embassies in Ottawa, Montreal and Toronto. People are flooding their MPs with messages, and demands are growing louder. Canada can become a refuge to the persecuted\u2014but what we\u2019re seeing right now is still window-dressing.

Everybody would understand she wants to build a positive relationship with the president of the United States. As first minister of Scotland I want to build a constructive relationship with the new administration. I\u2019m not criticising her for that. But relationships have to be based on values.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve all got a duty to speak up for fundamental values. There\u2019s a real concern on the part of many that introducing what is seen by many as a ban on Muslims, banning people because of their origin or faith, is deeply wrong and likely to be counterproductive in terms of the fight we all have an interest in against extremism and terrorism.</p> <p>\u201cIn terms of the refugee ban that in my view would go against the international obligations in terms of the Geneva Convention and the moral obligation we all have to deal with the refugee crisis.</p> <p>\u201cThe prime minister made the obvious point that these are matters for the US government. But these are issues that start to touch on moral issues that go beyond individual countries policies. And we all have a duty in these instances to speak up when we consider values that we all hold dear to be under threat. As I said to the prime minister I think a lot of people would like to see her say something much more strong along those lines.\u201d</p> <p>She continued: \u201cMorality is something we all have to judge for ourselves. I think there\u2019s a very strong body of opinion across the UK. Nobody is suggesting the president of American can\u2019t come to the UK nor is anyone suggesting a state visit is not appropriate at some stage but while these bans that have caused so much concern are in place it would be inappropriate for the state visit to proceed. It would be better to reconsider the timing of it.\u201d</p> <p>Asked if she would meet Trump in Scotland, Sturgeon said: \u201cThe relationship between Scotland and America is important. I\u2019m not going to start getting into refusing meeting people but nor am I going to maintain diplomatic silences over things that are really important in a values and principles sense.\u201d</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-01-30T15:15:40.033Z\">at 3.15pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-588f53d3e4b0f1550c0da6c3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/henrymcdonald\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-30T14:56:30.718Z\">2.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Seven human rights organisations have warned that the operation of the Trump ban at Ireland\u2019s two major airports could violate both Irish and European human rights law, writes Henry McDonald in Dublin.</p> <p>The groups who include Amnesty International Ireland, the Free Legal Advice Centres (FLAC) and the Irish Council of Civil Liberties have called today for an \u201curgent review\u201d of how US Homeland Security operates at Dublin and Shannon airports.</p> <p>Currently Homeland Security officials vet travellers from Ireland to the United States before they board transatlantic flights.

We are particularly concerned by reports that this order went into effect with little to no consultation with the Departments of State, Defense, Justice, and Homeland Security. </p> <p>Such a hasty process risks harmful results. We should not stop green-card holders from returning to the country they call home. We should not stop those who have served as interpreters for our military and diplomats from seeking refuge in the country they risked their lives to help. And we should not turn our backs on those refugees who have been shown through extensive vetting to pose no demonstrable threat to our nation, and who have suffered unspeakable horrors, most of them women and children.</p> <p><strong>Ultimately, we fear this executive order will become a self-inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism. At this very moment, American troops are fighting side-by-side with our Iraqi partners to defeat ISIL. But this executive order bans Iraqi pilots from coming to military bases in Arizona to fight our common enemies. Our most important allies in the fight against ISIL are the vast majority of Muslims who reject its apocalyptic ideology of hatred. This executive order sends a signal, intended or not, that America does not want Muslims coming into our country. That is why we fear this executive order may do more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security.</strong></p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-01-29T19:26:07.196Z\">at 7.26pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-588e3fbce4b0860ce556a218\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-29T19:17:50.624Z\">7.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This just in from Sabrina Siddiqui, a Guardian reporter at the DC protest:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SabrinaSiddiqui/status/825782732928188417\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Shinee the dog, who is originally from Korea, is here to protest <a href=\"https://t.co/750EpfueEG\">pic.twitter.com/750EpfueEG</a></p>&mdash;

Yet it is also true that the University, as an institution in the society, must step forward to object when policies and state action conflict with its fundamental values, and especially when they bespeak purposes and a mentality that are at odds with our basic mission.

It\u2019s so frustrating because we thought we\u2019d made it, that we\u2019d actually succeeded in demonstrating to the government that we had a legitimate relationship\u2026</p> <p>We were celebrating. We were to meet in Istanbul in March, send his passport to the embassy to get the visa, and enjoy some time together in Turkey before he finishes his Masters.

We are told that British values include the rule of law and mutual respect for and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs and for those without faith. </p> <p>\u201cAnd yet, our prime minister has found it hard to express these values when representing us on the world stage. At the same time, the ban will affect us here in Britain, as those with dual nationality such as Sir Mo Farah and the Conservative MP Nadhim Zahawi will also be affected by this ban. </p> <p>\u201cOur government should express in no uncertain terms how daft this policy is to its US counterparts, and press home how counter-productive it is in its professed fight to confront terrorism.</p> <p>\u201cIn front of Mr Trump, the prime minister said that the point of the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d was to have a frank dialogue.

All signatory states are obligated to do. The German government explained this policy in their call yesterday.\u201d</p> <p>Seibert further said that the German government would examine what consequences the ban would have for German citizens with dual citizenship, and would \u201crepresent their interests, if necessary, before our American partners\u201d.</p> <p>A summary of the phone call between Merkel and Trump, jointly issued to the press on Saturday, had made no mention of the travel ban, emphasising merely the \u201cfundamental significance\u201d of Nato and the intention to \u201cfurther deepen the already excellent bilateral relations in the coming years\u201d.</p> <p>One of the German citizens apparently already affected has a seat in the German parliament.

          "bodyText": "We\u2019re closing this live blog now but our live coverage of the reaction to Trump\u2019s travel ban continues. Here\u2019s a summary: Donald Trump has defended the implementation of a travel ban preventing people from seven mainly Muslim countries entering the US. \u201cIf the ban were announced with a one week notice, the \u201cbad\u201d would rush into our country during that week,\u201d he tweeted. The ban has caused confusion, protests and a series of legal actions at entry ports across the US. A protest is planned in London on Monday evening. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says he hopes to attend. Theresa May has been booed in Cardiff by protesters against Trump\u2019s travel ban. After the meeting, where the prime minister was discussing Brexit with leaders of the devolved assemblies, the Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said that Trump\u2019s state visit should be cancelled while travel bans are in place. Downing Street has insisted that Trump\u2019s state visit to the UK will go ahead despite widespread criticism of the invite including from several former ministers. A Downing Street source said: \u201cTo scrap the visit would undo everything following Mrs May\u2019s visit. America is a huge and important ally we have to think long term.\u201d Chancellor Angela Merkel said the global fight against terrorism does not warrant putting groups of people under suspicion. She said the ban is \u201ccontrary to the basic principles of international refugee help and international cooperation.\u201d More than 1.25 million people have signed a petition calling for the visit to be cancelled. The Commons is expected to vote on whether to debate the visit. The US embassy in Britain has insisted that it will not be offering visas to travellers from the seven countries, including those with dual nationality. This contradicts and assurance given to foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who is is due to update the Commons on US travel ban. Labour has accused Theresa May of \u201cappeasing\u201d Trump by refusing to withdraw the state visit invitation. Shami Chakrabarti, shadow attorney general, said: \u201cThe world is in a very precarious situation at the moment and we will not make this world safer or fairer by appeasing bullies like Mr Trump.\u201d Thousands took to the streets in major cities and converged on airports to protest the executive orders. Protests blocked the main road outside the international terminal at Los Angeles international airport late on Sunday night. Several people are reported still detained at LA airport, scene of legal challenges to the ban. An Iranian man with a valid visa is on his way back to the US after a federal court injunction stayed his removal back to Dubai from LA. Yemen\u2019s ministry of foreign affairs said it was dismayed by the decision to ban its citizens, warning that it \u201cfeeds into the narrative of extremists and sows division\u201d. It added that Yemen is \u201con the front lines in the fight against terrorism\u201d. Indonesia, a Muslim nation not covered by the ban, said the policy could hurt the global fight against terror. The Archbishop of Chicago, Cardinal Blase Cupich, said the travel orders were a \u201cdark moment\u201d in US history and contrary to American values. Financial markets in Asia fell amid the confusion surrounding the orders and amid ongoing concern that Trump will pursue protectionist trade policies. Markets were set to fall in Europe on the opening. Prince Charles would welcome a meeting with Donald Trump to discuss interfaith relations, sources close to him have said, amid a growing outcry at the US ban on travel from seven Muslim-majority nations, writes Robert Booth. A royal source said Charles remained willing to meet Trump if the state visit went ahead, saying: \u201cIt is not his style to turn his back.\u201d Charles\u2019s record as an advocate for interfaith relations and his high-level connections in the Islamic world, including close relations with Saudi and Gulf state royals, were cited by royal sources as reasons why his views might carry weight with Trump. Here\u2019s footage of May being booed in Cardiff. More from Cardiff where Theresa May was booed after attending a Brexit meeting with the heads of the devolved assemblies. The Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has said that Donald Trump\u2019s state visit ought to be cancelled while travel bans are in place and has called on the prime minister to speak up more strongly against the values that the president\u2019s policies have exposed, writes Steven Morris. Speaking after a one-to-one meeting with Theresa May that took place before the meeting of the joint ministerial committee in Cardiff, Sturgeon said she told the prime minister she should voice concerns about Trump more forcefully. Sturgeon told the Guardian: \u201cI said [to her] that while everybody understands that she wants to build a constructive relationship that relationship has to be based on values. \u201cI think many people would like to hear a stronger view from the UK government about the immigrant and refugee ban that was announced. \u201cI also said that I don\u2019t think it would be appropriate in these circumstances for the state visit to go ahead while these bans are in place given the understandable concern that people have about them and the messages they send and the impact they have.\u201d Asked if May had gone to meet Trump too quickly, Sturgeon replied: \u201cShe\u2019s the prime minister of the UK. Everybody would understand she wants to build a positive relationship with the president of the United States. As first minister of Scotland I want to build a constructive relationship with the new administration. I\u2019m not criticising her for that. But relationships have to be based on values. \u201cWe\u2019ve all got a duty to speak up for fundamental values. There\u2019s a real concern on the part of many that introducing what is seen by many as a ban on Muslims, banning people because of their origin or faith, is deeply wrong and likely to be counterproductive in terms of the fight we all have an interest in against extremism and terrorism. \u201cIn terms of the refugee ban that in my view would go against the international obligations in terms of the Geneva Convention and the moral obligation we all have to deal with the refugee crisis. \u201cThe prime minister made the obvious point that these are matters for the US government. But these are issues that start to touch on moral issues that go beyond individual countries policies. And we all have a duty in these instances to speak up when we consider values that we all hold dear to be under threat. As I said to the prime minister I think a lot of people would like to see her say something much more strong along those lines.\u201d She continued: \u201cMorality is something we all have to judge for ourselves. I think there\u2019s a very strong body of opinion across the UK. Nobody is suggesting the president of American can\u2019t come to the UK nor is anyone suggesting a state visit is not appropriate at some stage but while these bans that have caused so much concern are in place it would be inappropriate for the state visit to proceed. It would be better to reconsider the timing of it.\u201d Asked if she would meet Trump in Scotland, Sturgeon said: \u201cThe relationship between Scotland and America is important. I\u2019m not going to start getting into refusing meeting people but nor am I going to maintain diplomatic silences over things that are really important in a values and principles sense.\u201d Seven human rights organisations have warned that the operation of the Trump ban at Ireland\u2019s two major airports could violate both Irish and European human rights law, writes Henry McDonald in Dublin. The groups who include Amnesty International Ireland, the Free Legal Advice Centres (FLAC) and the Irish Council of Civil Liberties have called today for an \u201curgent review\u201d of how US Homeland Security operates at Dublin and Shannon airports. Currently Homeland Security officials vet travellers from Ireland to the United States before they board transatlantic flights. Those sections of the two airports where Homeland Security check travellers passports and other personal information are effectively American territory. In their statement the human rights groups said the Irish state must: \u201cConduct an urgent review of the pre-clearance system operating in Ireland and take appropriate action, up to and including suspension of the pre-clearance agreement, where there might be a reasonable chance that a person\u2019s rights under the Constitution, EU law or the European Convention on Human Rights may be under threat. \u201cProvide appropriate information on the applicable law and procedures to any person refused pre-clearance on the basis of the operation of the Executive Order. Irish immigration officials should also give any person refused pre-clearance the opportunity to seek legal advice. The organisations issuing this statement stand ready to give advice and/or make appropriate referrals, to any person refused pre-clearance in Ireland on the basis of the Executive Order. \u201cClarify the role of Garda\u00ed and immigration officials in the US pre-clearance process to ensure that in the exercise of their public functions, a person\u2019s rights under the Irish Constitution, European Convention on Human Rights, EU law or international human rights law will not be violated.\u201d Hundreds of foreign service officers and diplomats are reported to be backing a dissent memo expressing opposition to Trump\u2019s executive order banning refugees, according to Law Fare. It quotes the memo as saying: A policy which closes our doors to over 200 million legitimate travellers in the hopes of preventing a small number of travellers who intend to harm Americans from using the visa system to enter the United States will not achieve its aim of making our country safer. Moreover, such a policy runs counter to core American values of nondiscrimination, fair play, and extending a warm welcome to foreign visitors and immigrants. Alternative solutions are available to address the risk of terror attacks which are both more effective and in line with Department of State and American values. More Trump defiance via Twitter. Theresa May has been booed on a visit to Cardiff, after protesters against Trump\u2019s travel ban staged a demonstration outside Cardiff City Hall where she has been discussing Brexit with leaders of the devolved assemblies. The advice to airport staff over how to handle nationals from the affected countries has been in flux over the weekend, writes Alice Ross. Today that advice has changed again, an employee of an international airline working in Dubai told the Guardian. Their team has now been told not to reject would-be passengers from the seven countries at check-in. Instead they should be referred to the security team, who will then try to get clearance for them from the US border guards on a case-by-case basis. This applies to green card holders and holders of any visas. There\u2019s no advice for airport staff about how to handle travellers with dual nationalities. \u201cWe\u2019re letting them go. I think it\u2019s vague purposefully from our end to help our passengers,\u201d said the employee, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Here\u2019s the latest summary ... Donald Trump has defended the implementation of a travel ban preventing people from seven mainly Muslim countries entering the US. \u201cIf the ban were announced with a one week notice, the \u201cbad\u201d would rush into our country during that week,\u201d he tweeted. The ban has caused confusion, protests and a series of legal actions at entry ports across the US. A protest is planned in London on Monday evening. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says he hopes to attend. Downing Street has insisted that Trump\u2019s state visit to the UK will go ahead despite widespread criticism of the invite including from several former ministers. A Downing Street source said: \u201cTo scrap the visit would undo everything following Mrs May\u2019s visit. America is a huge and important ally we have to think long term.\u201d Chancellor Angela Merkel said the global fight against terrorism does not warrant putting groups of people under suspicion. She said the ban is \u201ccontrary to the basic principles of international refugee help and international cooperation.\u201d More than 1.25 million people have signed a petition calling for the visit to be cancelled. The Commons is expected to vote on whether to debate the visit. The US embassy in Britain has insisted that it will not be offering visas to travellers from the seven countries, including those with dual nationality. This contradicts and assurance given to foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who is is due to update the Commons on US travel ban. Labour has accused Theresa May of \u201cappeasing\u201d Trump by refusing to withdraw the state visit invitation. Shami Chakrabarti, shadow attorney general, said: \u201cThe world is in a very precarious situation at the moment and we will not make this world safer or fairer by appeasing bullies like Mr Trump.\u201d Thousands took to the streets in major cities and converged on airports to protest the executive orders. Protests blocked the main road outside the international terminal at Los Angeles international airport late on Sunday night. Several people are reported still detained at LA airport, scene of legal challenges to the ban. An Iranian man with a valid visa is on his way back to the US after a federal court injunction stayed his removal back to Dubai from LA. Indonesia, a Muslim nation not covered by the ban, said the policy could hurt the global fight against terror. The Archbishop of Chicago, Cardinal Blase Cupich, said the travel orders were a \u201cdark moment\u201d in US history and contrary to American values. Financial markets in Asia fell amid the confusion surrounding the orders and amid ongoing concern that Trump will pursue protectionist trade policies. Markets were set to fall in Europe on the opening. Interesting timing from George Osborne ... he has just announced he will be a visiting fellow at the university institute set up by Senator John McCain, a vocal critic of Trump\u2019s travel ban and his stance on torture. While Theresa May is facing mounting pressure over the way she invited Trump for a state visit, Osborne has been singing McCain\u2019s praises. The McCain institute quotes Osborne saying: \u201cI am very honoured to be named the McCain Institute\u2019s first Kissinger Fellow. I have long admired Henry Kissinger and John McCain - and count myself fortunate to know both these extraordinary leaders. I look forward to using this opportunity to work with the McCain Institute to see how we best promote our western values and secure a stable world order in this time of change.\u201d The most senior figure in the Church of Scotland, the Right Rev Dr Russell Barr has said he is horrified with President Trump\u2019s ban on refugees and travellers from seven Muslim majority countries, and implied the president is breaching Christian teachings, writes Severin Carrell. Dr Barr, moderator of the general assembly of the Church of Scotland, said he supported the protests against Trump\u2019s executive order across the US and globally. He supported a protest from the clerk of the US Presbyterian church\u2019s general assembly, Rev J Herbert Nelson II. \u201cHistory is littered with instances in which human distrust, xenophobia, and discrimination has sewn hatred and conflict; our own desire for self-preservation taken at the exclusion of others,\u201d Barr said, before calling on pressure to be applied to the UK government to listen to that message. \u201cThroughout history the bible has called Christians to live beyond hatred and fear, demonstrating a radical hospitality where the stranger finds welcome and refuge is provided for those who are oppressed.\u201d Britain has a long history of inviting controversial and embarrassing guests on state visits. Donald Trump is likely to fit in well with this tradition, writes Simon Tisdall. Chancellor Angela Merkel said the global fight against terrorism does not warrant putting groups of people under suspicion, Reuters reports. She added Trump\u2019s order to restrict people from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States violates the spirit of international cooperation. \u201cThe necessary and decisive battle against terrorism does not in any way justify putting groups of certain people under general suspicion - in this case people of Muslim belief or of a certain origin,\u201d Merkel told a news conference in Berlin. \u201cIn my opinion, this act runs contrary to the basic principles of international refugee help and international cooperation,\u201d she said. \u201cThe chancellery and the foreign ministry will do everything they can, especially for those dual citizens affected, to clear up the legal ramifications and to emphatically represent their interests under the law.\u201d She added: \u201cWe\u2019re clearly having close consultations with our European partners about this entire issue.\u201d Trump has said he has made a decision about the vacant ninth seat on the supreme court. In a tweet more like a trailer for a reality TV show, he kept the US in suspense by saying an announcement of the name will be made on Tuesday. Many have predicted that the row about the travel ban will ultimately have to be settled by the supreme court. The head of Goldman Sachs, many of whose alumni are among Trump\u2019s most senior advisers, has told the company that he does not back the ban. Speaking to his employee in voicemail Lloyd Blankfein said: \u201cThis is not a policy we support, and I would note that it has already been challenged in federal court, and some of the order has been enjoined at least temporarily.\u201d Blankfein said Goldman Sachs would work to minimise potential disruptions to employees and their families caused by Trump\u2019s order, according to a transcript seen by Reuters. Germany\u2019s chancellor, Angela Merkel, says her government is examining the situation and will be offering support to those affected by the travel ban, according to snap by Reuters. Trump has defended the hasty introduction of the travel ban, claiming \u201cbad dudes\u201d would have rushed into the US if they had been given notice. The EU\u2019s foreign affairs chief, Federica Mogherini, has spoken out against the travel ban saying it is \u201cnot the European way.\u201d She added \u201cIn Europe we have a history that has taught us that every time we invest in divisions and walls you might end up in a prison ... we celebrate when walls are brought down and bridges are built.\u201d She said Europe will continue to host refugees regardless of religion. Downing Street now appears to be trying to partially pass the buck to Buckingham Palace. A Downing Street statement said Theresa May was \u201cvery happy\u201d to invite President Donald Trump for a state visit on behalf of the Queen. Trump\u2019s chief spokesman Sean Spicer has defended the manner in which the White House rolled out the travel bans, AP reports. Spicer said officials were concerned about the possibility that doing it in a more open fashion would \u201ctelegraph what you\u2019re going to do\u201d to people who might have rushed to airports to beat the ban. In an appearance on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d Monday, Spicer also said officials\u2019 highest priority was \u201cto protect our own people\u201d and said everybody in the government who needed to be consulted was consulted. Spicer also says that Trump respects \u201cpeople who are Muslim and peace-loving. But he also recognises that certain countries and certain areas of the world produce people who seek to do us harm.\u201d The spokesman, asked about delays at airports experienced by travellers with valid papers, said that 109 of some 325, 000 travellers \u201cwere slowed down\u201d in their trips, and called that \u201ca small price to pay\u201d for protecting the American people. Andrew Sparrow has a summary of a brief from the prime minister\u2019s office: Downing Street said Britons were not getting special treatment in relation to the US travel ban. He said the Foreign Office statement last night about how the new US rules affected dual nationals was not intended to mean that British dual nationals were getting preferential treatment. It was meant to be a clarification of how the rules affected dual nationals generally. He said he could not comment on the new statement issued by the American embassy this morning because he had not seen it. (See 12.01pm.) The spokesman confirmed that Britain did not agree with President Trump\u2019s move. \u201cWe disagree with these restrictions,\u201d the spokesman said. He said that statement covered all aspects of the Trump travel ban. We don\u2019t agree with these restrictions, it is not the way we would do it. Where people\u2019s rights, UK citizens\u2019 rights, have been affected, we have set about getting a clarification to allow them to travel. As we pointed out last week, where we disagree with something we are happy to say we disagree with it. The spokesman said that the decision to invite Trump to the UK for a state visit was first taken by the state visit committee that operates in the Foreign Office. Asked why Trump was being offered a state visit so soon, when previous presidents have had to wait months or years for an equivalent invitation, the spokesman said said: There is no set timing that a president needs to be in office before they receive, or don\u2019t receive, an invitation for a state visit. There is a process for state visits. Each year the government looks at the recommendations that are made by the committee for state visits, those recommendations are then put to Buckingham Palace, the palace then needs to agree to the visit, then, historically the invitation is extended on behalf of Her Majesty by the government, and that is the process that took place this time. But the spokesman was unable to say who sits on the committee, or to explain why Trump received his invitation within a week of taking office. (Very few observers will believe that Trump got the invitation just because an obscure committee came up with the idea. Ultimately these decisions are taken by Number 10, and May clearly offered Trump a visit quickly because he appears to want one desperatelyand she thought this would help to improve a relationship that has become particularly important in the light of Brexit.) The spokesman also dismissed the prospect of the invitation being withdrawn. The invitation has been extended and it has been accepted. The UK and the US have a very strong, close relationship and it is right that we continue to work together. The spokesman said it was up to parliament to decide whether the petition saying Donald Trump should not be invited to the UK for a state visit should be debated. The petition has received more than 1m signatures, and petitions getting more than 100,000 signatures are normally considered for debate. But by convention the Commons does not normally debate matters relating to the Queen, and so it is likely that this may never get debated. Asked if the prime minister would like to see this debated in parliament, the spokesman said this was a matter for parliament. The spokesman said the planned white paper on Brexit would be published as soon as possible, but he refused to say when. May is travelling to Dublin after the joint ministerial committee meeting in Cardiff for talks with the Irish prime minister, Enda Kenny. May will hold a press conference in Dublin in the early evening. Damian Green, the work and pensions secretary, has announced that London and Manchester will get around \u00a3100m \u201cto develop, procure and deliver localised versions of the new Work and Health Programme to fit the needs of their residents\u201d. More here. Sudan\u2019s foreign minister, Ibrahim Ghadour, has criticised the US ban on travellers from his country, pointing out that it comes as the US and Sudan had just started cooperating on anti-terrorism. Speaking to Bloomberg he said: \u201cWe feel sorry that the decision was taken at a time we started cooperating and the sanctions were lifted. \u201cWe are ready to continue for the benefit of our country and countries of the region as well as other countries who are effected by terrorism, which is now a transnational phenomenon,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Americans know that we\u2019re not harbouring any opposition of any other country, including South Sudan. They know that the government has negotiated peace with rebels.\u201d In his third tweet of the day conceded that \u201cthere is nothing nice about searching for terrorists before they can enter our country\u201d. But he appears in no mood to back down, by pointing out that the ban was part of his campaign. Speaking to Sky News, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said he hoped to attend this evening\u2019s rally outside Downing Street against Donald Trump\u2019s travel ban. He said of the policy: \u201cIt\u2019s outrageous, it\u2019s illegal as well as being immoral. I think we should stand up for the values we believe in which is you don\u2019t discriminate... \u201cWe should say candidly and firmly to friends as well as to those who we don\u2019t agree with, human rights are important, the rights of people are important and where does all this lead to? If you\u2019re saying people because they\u2019re Muslims can\u2019t travel to the United States, where does that lead to? \u201cWe would condemn any other country in the world for doing this, I think we should do the same and say firmly to the United States president, I\u2019m really sorry, we just cannot support or agree with you on this.\u201d Corbyn said he would try to attend the rally but would \u201ccertainly be supporting it\u201d. Donald Trump has claimed that the problems seen at US airports over the weekend were a result of computer outages and protesters rather than his travel ban. The Guardian\u2019s political editor, Anushka Asthana, says the government is adamant that the Foreign Office statement last night \u2013 that dual nationals will be allowed in as long as they are not travelling from one of the seven countries \u2013 is correct, despite the contradictory statement from the US embassy in London. The insurance company AXA UK, says its travel policy holders will be entitled to claims if they have been hit by Trump\u2019s travel ban. It said: \u201cIn light of the sudden and unexpected decision by the Trump administration to block entry to the US for nationals from Syria, Somalia, Sudan, Iraq, Iran, Libya and Yemen, AXA Insurance UK confirms that individuals who have been denied entry as a result of the executive order, will be able to claim on their policy. Although not technically covered, we view the current situation as unprecedented and unforeseen and as such we are extending the cover under our policies. For those intending to travel to, or return from, the United States of America we recommend allowing extra time due to protests currently taking place at a number of airports.\u201d Andrew Sparrow is just back form a lobby briefing where Downing Street could not explain contradictions in foreign advice about dual nationals and a new statement from the US embassy in London. This morning the American embassy in London has put out a statement suggesting that Britons with dual nationality from Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen will be affected by the US travel ban. This appears to contradict the statement issued by the Foreign Office last night. Asked about the statement from the American embassy, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said he could not comment because he had not seen it. But this is what he did say about the issue. Britons are not getting special treatment in relation to the travel ban, the spokesman said. He said the Foreign Office statement last night about how the new US rules affected dual nationals was not intended to mean that British dual nationals were getting preferential treatment. It was meant to be a clarification of how the rules affected dual nationals generally. The spokesman confirmed that Britain did not agree with President Trump\u2019s move. \u201cWe disagree with these restrictions,\u201d the spokesman said. He said that statement covered all aspects of the Trump travel ban. More here. Suzanne Moore argues that a state visit would be worse than appeasing Trump. The British state reserves its pomp and pageantry for those with shared values. To do this for Trump is not simply appeasing his, but legitimising his regime. This is not just embarrassing for the Queen but for every decent citizen. The vicar\u2019s daughter may have lost her moral compass somewhere over the Atlantic, but this petition and the debate it prompts shows more than a million of us are clinging onto ours. It is not in the national interest to bend a knee to hate. The UK Syrian community has condemned Trumps travel ban and warned that it could lead to a rise in hate crime in the UK. In a statement it said: We fear that this executive order will have a reverse effect of fuelling hate and inciting terrorism in the UK and across the world, as we have already seen by the terrorist shooting at a Canadian mosque on 29 January which killed six worshippers and injured an additional eight. Such potential ramifications were stressed by US Republican Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham who argued in a joint statement that Trump\u2019s Muslim ban could \u2018become a self-inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism\u2019. We are also concerned about the repercussions that Trump\u2019s Muslim ban will have against Syrian refugees who fled the Syrian conflict under the worst imaginable conditions \u2013 arbitrary arrest, torture, constant bombardment, and relentless siege. This group deserves compassion and assistance from Western countries, not to mention that many have fled from the very terrorism which Trump has vowed to eradicate. We call upon the UK to echo the stand of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau by welcoming Syrian refugees banned by the US into the UK ... We call upon the government to offer a formal protest against Trump\u2019s Muslim ban and to denounce it as discriminatory and counterproductive to the fight against terror. Ukip\u2019s former leader Nigel Farage has backed Trump\u2019s travel ban and called on the UK government to impose similar measures. He accused Britain\u2019s political establishment of hypocrisy by failing to speak out against a temporary ban on Iraqis entering the US imposed by President Obama in 2011. Speaking to BBC News Farage said: \u201cIt is seems to me that when Obama does something that\u2019s fine, but that somehow Trump in this category of being a bad guy.\u201d He added: \u201cThis was all part of his manifesto, and in fact in some ways he hasn\u2019t gone as far as he said in some parts of the campaign.\u201d Asked if he wanted to see extreme vetting in the UK, Farage said: \u201cI certainly do. I want us to be as careful as we can.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve got moderate Muslim friends living in this country, who feel every time there is a terrorist attack that their quality of life is declining hugely. So anything we can do actually to stop these things happening actually makes it better for everybody.\u201d Martin Ford, the councillor who sparked a year long planning battle in 2008 over Donald Trump\u2019s first Scottish golf course in Aberdeenshire, has signed the petition against the US president\u2019s state visit, writes Severin Carrell. Then a Liberal Democrat councillor who chaired the area\u2019s neighbourhood committee, Ford used his casting vote to block Trump\u2019s proposals for a \u00a31bn golf resort because it ruined rare and environmentally protected dunes and breached the local plan. The committee\u2019s rejection split the council. Scottish ministers, supported by the then first minister and local MSP Alex Salmond, ordered a public inquiry which pushed the plan through. Now a Scottish Green party councillor, Ford said; \u201cThe petition makes the point that since, unbelievably, Mr Trump is now the President of the United States, the UK will have to deal with him and admit him to this country in that capacity. However, we don\u2019t have to give him the honour of an official state visit and meeting the Queen, and we clearly shouldn\u2019t. \u201cMr Trump is a deeply unpleasant individual with abhorrent views. So while we can\u2019t ignore Mr Trump, the UK must do nothing that suggests support or approval of his behaviour.\u201d The UK Parliament petitions website shows lukewarm support for the petition in the surrounding Commons constituency of Gordon, where Salmond is the MP, with only 1.35% support. Iraq\u2019s parliament has voted to \u201cretaliate\u201d against the travel ban, according to snap from Reuters. Baghdad Invest says Iraq has banned US citizens from travelling to Iraq for 90 days. Iraq has said that once USA lifts the travel ban on citizens of Iraq travelling to the United States of America, it would do the same. Peter Walker has asked the Foreign Office to clarify the advice to dual nationals about travelling to the US. The European Union is analysing Trump\u2019s ban to see if it would affect Europeans, a spokesman for the bloc\u2019s executive said, Reuters reports. European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas told a news conference that the bloc was getting \u201cconflicting input\u201d on whether the ban would affect EU citizens with dual nationality from the countries affected. Asked about Trump\u2019s move, he said that the EU itself did not discriminate among people arriving on the grounds of race, nationality or religion. So much for that apparent commitment to Boris Johnson about dual nationals in the UK. The US embassy in the UK has repeated that warning, made in Berlin, about visa issuance. Per US Presidential Executive Order signed on January 27, 2017, visa issuance to aliens from the countries of Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen has been suspended effective immediately until further notification. If you are a national, or dual national, of one of these countries, please do not schedule a visa appointment or pay any visa fees at this time. If you already have an appointment scheduled, please DO NOT ATTEND your appointment as we will not be able to proceed with your visa interview. Please note that certain travel for official governmental purposes, related to official business at or on behalf of designated international organizations, on behalf of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or by certain officials is not subject to this suspension. Former shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, now chair of the home affairs select committee, has backed calls for an emergency debate on Trump\u2019s travel ban. The US embassy in Berlin has said that visa issuance had been suspended to nationals, or dual nationals, of Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. In an update on its Facebook page, the embassy said: \u201cPer US Presidential Executive Order signed on January 27, 2017, visa issuance to aliens from the countries of Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen has been suspended effective immediately until further notification.\u201d \u201cIf you are a national, or dual national, of one of these countries, please do not schedule a visa appointment or pay any visa fees at this time.\u201d Workers from companies such as Facebook and Google have no idea when they\u2019ll next see their family, as startup founders say their companies are at risk, writes Olivia Solon in San Francisco Congress should move to impeach Trump over this growing crisis, argues Trevor Timm. No matter your political views, the fact that the White House is attempting to circumvent legal advice, install dubious appointees to incredible powerful national security positions and violate court orders is outrageous and despicable, so let\u2019s be clear: Congress needs to quickly move towards impeachment if this is true. In the US, a handful of powerful Catholic cardinals have spoken forcefully against Trump\u2019s executive order, writes Stephanie Kirchgaessner. Joe Tobin, the newly installed cardinal in Newark, New Jersey, even appeared to suggest that Donald Trump was a con man after criticising the proposed building of a border wall as \u201cnot rational\u201d and \u201cinhuman\u201d. On Twitter Tobin wrote: \u201cA fearful nation talks about building walls and is vulnerable to con men. We must challenge the fear before we are led into darkness\u201d. Another cardinal, Blas\u00e9 Cupich of Chicago, said the weekend had been a \u201cdark moment in US history\u201d. He said the implementation of Trump\u2019s order to halt migrants and refugees had been \u201crushed, chaotic, cruel, and oblivious to the realities that will produce enduring security for the US\u201d. Cupich added: \u201cThe world is watching as we abandon our commitments to American values. These actions give aid and comfort to those who would destroy our way of life. They lower our estimation in the eyes of the many peoples who want to know America as a defender of human rights and religious liberty, not a nation that targets religious populations and then shuts its doors on them.\u201d But there was one notable voice of support for Trump. Archbishop Charles Chaput of Philadelphia, the leading conservative in the US Catholic hierarchy who was recently passed over for a promotion by Pope Francis, called on the University of Notre Dame to honour Trump with an honourary degree this spring. In a statement on Friday, Chaput decried the intense opposition to Trump and hailed the Republican president\u2019s opposition to abortion rights. The Board of Deputies of British Jews has added its voice to growing international condemnation of the travel ban. Jonathan Arkush, President of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said: \u201cBans based on national origin are indiscriminate and unjust. They would be unlawful in UK law. While we all understand the need to properly check those who enter our countries, this needs to be balanced with compassion towards the plight of those fleeing for their lives.\u201d Arkush added: \u201cThis is a dismaying beginning to a new US Administration. Good government needs cool, rational judgments delivered professionally, not hasty policy-making on the hoof. All those who respect and admire the USA\u2019s commitment to freedom will call on President Trump to review this misconceived executive order.\u201d Here\u2019s video of protesters ralling in some of the United States\u2019 largest airports in anger over president Trump\u2019s travel ban. Demonstrations have taken place in several cities after the US president imposed a freeze on refugee admissions and banned travellers from seven Muslim-majority countries. Here\u2019s a summary of how things currently stand. Donald Trump\u2019s plans to prevent people from seven mainly Muslim countries entering the US have caused confusion, protests and a series of legal actions at entry ports across the US. Downing Street has insisted that Trump\u2019s state visit to the UK will go ahead despite widespread criticism of the invite including from several former ministers. A Downing Street source said: \u201cTo scrap the visit would undo everything following Mrs May\u2019s visit. America is a huge and important ally we have to think long term.\u201d More than a million people have signed a petition calling for the visit to be cancelled. The Commons is expected to vote on Tuesday on whether to debate the visit. Foreign secretary Boris Johnson is due to update the Commons on US travel ban. Labour has accused Theresa May of \u201cappeasing\u201d Trump by refusing to withdraw the state visit invitation. Shami Chakrabarti, shadow attorney general, said: \u201cThe world is in a very precarious situation at the moment and we will not make this world safer or fairer by appeasing bullies like Mr Trump.\u201d The White House has defended the policy as a \u201cmassive success\u201d and Trump himself has denied it is a ban on Muslims. Thousands took to the streets in major cities and converged on airports to protest the executive orders. Protests blocked the main road outside the international terminal at Los Angeles international airport late on Sunday night. Several people are reported still detained at LA airport, scene of legal challenges to the ban. An Iranian man with a valid visa is on his way back to the US after a federal court injunction stayed his removal back to Dubai from LA. Indonesia, a Muslim nation not covered by the ban, said the policy could hurt the global fight against terror. The Archbishop of Chicago, Cardinal Blase Cupich, said the travel orders were a \u201cdark moment\u201d in US history and contrary to American values. Financial markets in Asia fell amid the confusion surrounding the orders and amid ongoing concern that Trump will pursue protectionist trade policies. Markets were set to fall in Europe on the opening. Adam Vaughan has more on that decision by Starbuck to hire 10,000 refugees. Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, will be making a statement in the Commons later about the US travel ban, he has told Sky News. Mexicans are musing openly about how to retaliate against Trump\u2019s bullying, writes David Agren in Mexico City. Mexico may lack the size, stature and economic might of its northern neighbour, but analysts say the country does have options, all of which should be under consideration due to the severity of the crisis. \u201cHe ranted and raved during the campaign, but the guy has a knife to our throat now,\u201d said Federico Est\u00e9vez, political science professor at the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico. \u201cBut it\u2019s not like Mexico has no leverage. It does.\u201d The Mexican president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, has stated unequivocally that Mexico will not pay for a wall which could cost as much as $25bn, but analysts say price isn\u2019t the issue. \u201cIt\u2019s a deal-breaker, but not because of the wall,\u201d Est\u00e9vez said. \u201cIt\u2019s because of the public nature of the humiliation involved. What it really entails is sinking Nafta.\u201d Nafta opened up a Mexican economy that was once so closed that candy and consumer goods like Levi\u2019s Jeans were smuggled across the frontier and sold as contraband. Mexico now sends 80% of its exports north and cross-border trade totals more than $500bn. Trump could tank the deal in ways other than ripping it up. He could pursue an \u201cAmerica first\u201d line on investment, making it untenable for Mexico to remain a signatory, or simply jawbone companies into avoiding Mexican investments \u2013 as he has done with carmakers. Is this a Muslim ban? Alan Yuhas examines the order and its vagueness: Tory MP James Cleverly tries to de-link government cosying up to Trump from Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU. Well on the way to the next million ... That petition has now topped the million signatory mark. The row over the travel ban should prompt Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to rethink his three-line whip to Labour MPs on triggering article 50, argues John Harris. We all know the opposing arguments, and they are worth taking seriously: that even if the referendum result is speciously interpreted as consent for hard Brexit, it has to be respected; that many Labour MPs represent areas that voted leave and fear Ukip; that there are two byelections coming up in leave-voting seats, and that the party is in an unbelievably fragile position. But at the same time, I know what many people who fear the Trump/Brexit moment will say: that at a moment so freighted with historic significance, when the UK may be about to trade in an enduring alliance with Europe for a role as the ally of a truly terrifying US president, will it really be Labour MPs\u2019 choice to back the most reckless course imaginable? We shall soon see. Starbucks says it will hire 10,000 refugees over the next five years, in response to Trump\u2019s travel ban. Howard Schultz, the coffee retailer\u2019s chairman and CEO, said in a letter to employees that the hiring would apply to stores worldwide and the effort would start in the United States where the focus would be on hiring immigrants \u201cwho have served with US troops as interpreters and support personnel.\u201d It said: We have a long history of hiring young people looking for opportunities and a pathway to a new life around the world. This is why we are doubling down on this commitment by working with our equity market employees as well as joint venture and licensed market partners in a concerted effort to welcome and seek opportunities for those fleeing war, violence, persecution and discrimination. There are more than 65 million citizens of the world recognized as refugees by the United Nations, and we are developing plans to hire 10,000 of them over five years in the 75 countries around the world where Starbucks does business. And we will start this effort here in the US by making the initial focus of our hiring efforts on those individuals who have served with U.S. troops as interpreters and support personnel in the various countries where our military has asked for such support. Former Labour leader Ed Miliband is to apply for an emergency Commons debate on Trump\u2019s travel ban. He is backed by Tory MP Nadhim Zahawi who has spoken out over the ban. The BBC\u2019s assistant political editor, Norman Smith, has been told that MPs will vote on whether to debate Trump\u2019s state visit. The petition has topped 990,000 signatories. LibDem Leader Tim Farron is stepping up the pressure on Theresa May over her invitation to grant Trump a state visit to the UK. In a statement he said: \u201cThe government is ignoring millions of ordinary British people and their revulsion that Donald Trump will receive the red carpet treatment.\u201d That petition against the visit is now very close to a million signatories. Farron added: \u201cIt is wrong for Theresa May to put The Queen in this position. People can see how desperate she is for a Brexit trade deal. But the Prime Minister needs to be aware how dangerous her game with President Trump is. \u201cTony Blair decided in 2002 to hitch his cart to a president and say: \u201cI\u2019m with you whatever\u201d. It sank his premiership, and poisoned his legacy. May risks exactly the same.\u201d In one of his last media blogs for the Guardian, commentator Roy Greenslade attacks the \u201cshamefully\u201d pragmatic response of the much of the British press to the Trump\u2019s travel ban. Clearly, \u201cBritish interests\u201d, most obviously over trade because of Brexit, are the overriding concern for the pragmatists. The Daily Mirror, at least, was having none of it: \u201cThe prime minister should inform the maverick US president that he is not welcome on a state visit, so no banquet with the Queen until he drops the grotesque bigotry. \u201cThis crisis is a severe test of May\u2019s pledge to be a \u2018candid friend\u2019 after the PM shamefully dodged, three times, criticising a policy that is light on evidence but heavy on prejudice.\u201d Precisely. Principle counts more than pragmatism. Pakistan\u2019s leading opposition politician, Imran Khan, has urged his country to ban Americans if Trump extends the travel ban to Pakistan, Voice of America reports. Addressing a rally in the central Pakistani town of Sahiwal on Sunday, Khan denounced the ban as anti-Muslim and praised Iran for its retaliatory action of banning Americans from entering the Islamic Republic. \u201cI want to tell all my fellow Pakistanis today, I pray that Donald Trump really bans visas for us. And then if America tells us they are stopping visas for us we will also, like Iran, tell them we are going to stop visas for Americans. Khan\u2019s Pakistan Tehrik-e-Insaf party is the third major political force in the national parliament, and rules the country\u2019s northwestern Khyber-Pakhtunkhaw province. Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif\u2019s government has not yet commented about Trump\u2019s ban on Muslim countries. Officials in Islamabad are hoping for improvement in their usually uneasy relations with Washington under the Trump presidency. Lady Warsi is the latest former Tory minister to speak out against the proposed Trump state visit to the UK. Last night former foreign office minister, Alistair Burt, said the \u201coptics\u201d of President Trump visiting the UK are \u201cvery bad\u201d and there should be a \u201cjoint decision\u201d to delay the visit. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Westminster Hour, Burt said: \u201cThere would undoubtedly be serious demonstrations against President Trump. There is the uncomfortable situation of the ban, with UK nationals or dual nationals being caught up in it. And I would have thought both US officials and foreign office officials here and Number Ten are thinking \u201cthis is going to look really terrible\u201d.\u201d \u201cOn the other hand, the invitation has been offered and if Trump does come here, he will be exposed to opinion in the UK. If he thought his first press conference and outing was rough, he ought to wait until he gets a full one. And there might be some advantage in that. \u201cMy sense is, in short, I think this looks too uncomfortable and I wonder if they will find a diplomatic excuse to delay this, such as wanting the EU negotiations to go a little bit further down the line so that a trade conversation can be a little bit more structured. But at the moment, the idea of having a visit would seem very uncomfortable to both sides.\u201d \u201cBut I think it\u2019s quite different then for the UK then to withdraw an invitation. My thinking would be that if I was the American officials I think they should help the UK to try and find a reason for why this visit should not go ahead in the short term. It should be a joint decision otherwise there will be some lasting damage each way, and it might be better to avoid that if we can.\u201d Baroness Sayeeda Warsi, a former minister for faith communities and former co-chair of the Conservative Party, has backed calls on the government to withdraw its state visit invitation to Trump. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme Lady Warsi criticised the reluctance of ministers to criticise Trump over the ban. She said: \u201cWhat is worrying now is the silence that we are getting from government. And it is important that government come out and say this is a Muslim ban which they condemn.\u201d Warsi added: \u201cWe have to question whether, in Britain, this is something that Britain should be doing for a man who has no respect for women, disdain for minorities, little value for LGBT communities, no compassion for the vulnerable and whose policies are rooted in divisive rhetoric.\u201d She added: \u201cThose who run and govern this country bowing down to a man who holds the views that he holds, values which are not the same as British values, I think is sending out a very wrong signal.\u201d Warsi said that politics is facing a \u201ccrossroads\u201d following Mr Trump\u2019s election. She said: \u201cIf we want to continue to be a country that supports liberal, progressive values in which all have equal worth and equal value in our society, then we have to be clear that we voice that view and that opinion, so that people in this country know that whatever crazy things the President of the United States may be doing, it is not what we believe and not what we support ... \u201cWe need to call it what it is and it is a Muslim ban ... it is a ban on people from majority Muslim countries, and we have exempted people who aren\u2019t Muslim, so make of that what you want. Frank Gaffney, a former assistant secretary of defence to President Regan, defended Trump\u2019s travel ban and said it should go further. Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme Gaffney, now the president of the national security thinktank the Center for Security Policy, said: \u201cI\u2019m not aware of any indication that he [Trump] is intent on backing down, and I don\u2019t think he should. I believe that the motivation for the action that he has taken are directly tied to the national security of the United States and the public safety of the American people.\u201d Gaffney added: \u201cIt begins a course correction on a policy approach that has been deeply flawed and increasingly problematic, namely of being indifferent to the presence in our midst of those who adhere to totalitarian, supremacist programme they call Sharia \u2013 a fundamentally an anti-constitutional and jihadist project. We don\u2019t need to import more of them and I think that is what Donald Trump has concluded as well. \u201cOne has to be daft to ignore claims by the Islamic State that it is going to bring people into this country, as I believe they have done in Europe already, who are jihadists. What Donald Trump is do, quite sensibly, is to make that harder.\u201d Gaffney urged Trump to sign another executive order to designate the Muslim Brotherhood as \u201cthe terrorist organisation that is\u201d. He also said travellers from Saudi Arabia should be added to the list of those banned from travelling to the US. \u201cI\u2019m not quite sure why you wouldn\u2019t include them, because not only were they deeply involved in the 9/11 attacks, but the government of Saudi Arabia has consistently pursued a jihadist policy external to the Kingdom. They are deeply problematic nation.\u201d Asked about criticism of the travel ban by Republican Senators like John McCain and Lindsey Graham, Gaffeny said: \u201cthey haven\u2019t a clue what they are talking about.\u201d He said both had embraced members of the Muslim Brotherhood and couldn\u2019t tell who were jihadists. Richard Barrett, a former head of counter-terrorism at MI6, criticised Trump\u2019s travel ban as playing into the hands of Islamic State terrorists. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme he said: \u201cThe narrative of the Islamic State is precisely what Mr Trump appears to be confirming \u2013 that Americans are against people of Muslim faith, they particularly discriminate against them in favour of other people. So it is this them or us type picture that the Islamic State promotes.\u201d Barret, who is now director of the Global Strategy Network, dismissed the ban as \u201ca case of alternative counter terrorism policy\u201d. He added: \u201cThe great majority of attacks in the United States since 9/11 and even before that have been conducted by US citizens - in fact well over 80%.\u201d Barrett suggested the ban was a knee jerk response to terrorism that would not work. He said: \u201cWe have got to remember what we are fighting for as well as what we are fighting against. And what we are fighting for is these universal freedoms that we all promote.\u201d \u201cIt is a huge problem and terrorism really captures the imagination and therefore demands actions by politicians even though it may not be a particularly significant threat.\u201d Labour has accused Theresa May of \u201cappeasement\u201d towards Donald Trump after Downing Street again rejected a petition calling for the cancellation of the president\u2019s state visit to Britain. A Downing Street source dismissed agreeing to the petition, which has now attracted almost a million signatures, as a \u201cpopulist gesture\u201d. The BBC quoted the source saying: \u201cThe invitation has been issued and accepted. To scrap the visit would undo everything following Mrs May\u2019s visit. America is a huge and important ally we have to think long term.\u201d Shadow attorney general Shami Chakrabarti urged the prime minister to think again. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that sounds like appeasement to me,\u201d she told BBC Breakfast after being read the statement from Downing Street. She added: \u201cThe world is in a very precarious situation at the moment and we will not make this world safer or fairer by appeasing bullies like Mr Trump.\u201d Chakrabarti said Trump\u2019s travel ban was counter-productive. She said: \u201cIt will make the world a less safe place and we got to do everything we can to stand up to this bully in the White House. That special relationship has to be based on shared values and so far what I have seen from Mr Trump is misogyny, racism, ill-treatment of refugees, reinstatement of torture and just a general pedalling of hate.\u201d She added: \u201cI would urge the prime minister to think again. A state visit is premature we should not be rewarding human rights abuses by rolling out the red carpet in this country. Donald Trump\u2019s plans to prevent people from seven mainly Muslim countries entering the US have caused confusion, protests and a series of legal actions at entry ports across the US. The White House has defended the policy as a \u201cmassive success\u201d and Trump himself has denied it is a ban on Muslims.

Markets were set to fall in Europe on the opening. One final picture from Dhanpaul Narine, a reader who was at the protests at JFK airport in New York. He is a Guyanese-American living in New York and was at the protests because he believes Caribbean nations could be next to face some kind of travel bans and wanted to show solidarity. Here he is holding the Guyana flag at JFK. Thanks for reading and thanks for all your pictures and emails. One of the biggest US protests has been at Los Angeles international airport \u2013 LAX in its short code \u2013 where thousands of people have gathered. It\u2019s 10.40pm there and the LA Times reports that protesters have blocked the main road outside the Tom Bradley international terminal, chanting \u201clet them in\u201d. There also appear to be large crowds still inside the terminal buildings. LAX is one of the biggest entry points in the US and has been the focus of legal efforts to overturn the ban. The ACLU local branch successfully secured the release of three people: Khanon Mahindokht Azad, a 72-year-old Iranian woman visiting her childlren in the US; Gishh Alsaeedi, an 82-year-old iraqi woman also visiting her family; and Mustafa Abdul Wahed, a Syrian born oil industyr worker with a Saudi passport. But lawyers said it was still difficult to get legal help for others being held at airports. Read the full court submission here. British actors have attacked the Trump proposals as stars from the world of film and television gathered in Los Angeles for the Screen Actors Guild awards. Dev Patel, who was nominated for best supporting actor in Lion, said the travel ban was \u201chorrible\u201d and \u201cdivisive\u201d. Speaking on the red carpet, Patel said: I just flew in from India a day ago. When I heard the news it was utterly devastating. \u201cThe first thing that came into my head was the children who arrive on these shores with hope in their hearts. It\u2019s horrible. It\u2019s divisive. I hope something changes and something can be done because it really is terrible. Riz Ahmed, star of Rogue One, said people should \u201cmake their voices heard\u201d and revealed he knew people hit by the US travel ban. Protests have taken place across the US on Sunday night. Here is an estimate of the numbers involved in the protests at the main locations (thanks to Reuters and AP): Manhattan \u2013 10,000 Washington DC \u2013 8,000 (plus about 200 at Dulles airport) Copley Square, Boston \u2013 10,000 LA international airport \u2013 4,000 Detroit Metropolitan airport \u2013 3,000 O\u2019Hare international, Chicago \u2013 hundreds (including 150 pro bono lawyers) Houston downtown \u2013 500 Indianapolis international airport \u2013 600 Seattle \u2013 3,000 Dallas-Fort Worth international airport \u2013 800 The financial markets have been in subdued mood today amid concerns about the Trump travel ban. Japan\u2019s Nikkei widened losses to 0.7% as demand for the safe-haven yen weighed on exporters. Australian shares on the ASX200 index tumbled more than 1%, while New Zealand pulled back 0.6%. European markets are set to slip when trading opens later this morning, according to online trading platform IG. Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at CMC in Sydney, said the travel ban added to concerns about the Trump administration\u2019s policy settings. The thinking is that if carries through with building the border wall and banning Muslims from the US, he might also push through his promised 45% tariffs on Chinese imports. Most experts agree that would be a devastating blow for the world\u2019s economy. Spooner said: The new US immigration policy contributes to background concerns about the potential for escalating tensions and scope for retaliation on travel and trade policy. However, from a market perspective, the policy is not at this stage likely to have any material financial or commercial impact as it currently stands. The shooting at the Quebec City mosque which reportedly killed five people was a \u201cterrorist attack on Muslims\u201d, said Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau. In a statement he said: \u201cWe condemn this terrorist attack on Muslims in a centre of worship and refuge.\u201d Quebec premier Philippe Couillard also called the killings a \u201cterrorist act\u201d, tweeting that they were an act of \u201cbarbaric violence\u201d. More from our readers. Richard Rand has sent me these pictures from Albuquerque airport in New Mexico. The travel orders are causing headaches for the world\u2019s airlines. Emirates said earlier that it has changed pilot and flight attendant rosters on flights to the US following the signing of the order so that its crew did not become embroiled in the immigration problems. It had \u201cmade the necessary adjustments to our crewing, to comply with the latest requirements,\u201d, an Emirates spokeswoman told Reuters. Japan Airlines said on Monday it has begun screening passengers from the seven Muslim-majority countries affected by the travel ban before their departure for the US. Etihad Airways, which is based in Abu Dhabi, said the airline had \u201ctaken steps to ensure there will be no issues for flights departing over the coming weeks\u201d. Nicoley Baublies, from the German cabin crew union UFO, said the move meant uncertainty for Lufthansa because it had \u201calways ensured it has very diverse crews, with staff of different nationalities and that means that we are for the first time in decades having to look at where people come from\u201d. A spokesman for Lufthansa said on Sunday it was too early to comment. Thanks to Reuters for those updates. The billionaire Koch brothers, Charles and David, have signalled their opposition to two of Donald Trump\u2019s most controversial policies. The brothers\u2019 campaign group Americans for Prosperity have launched a bid to sink the Trump border tax plan which aims to raise millions from import duty to pay for a wall along the Mexican border. On Sunday the group also challenged Trump\u2019s intention to stop the movement of people from countries with large Muslim populations from traveling to the United States. \u201cThe travel ban is the wrong approach and will likely be counterproductive,\u201d said an official of the Koch networ, which refused to endorse Trump during his presidential campaign. In Australia, prime minister Malcolm Turnbull refused to criticise the Trump administration\u2019s immigration policies when he was quizzed on the issue on Monday. Australia is hoping to resettle detained asylum seekers from its camps on the Pacific islands of Nauru and Manus Island to the US. Australia will take refugees from Costa Rica in exchange. Read our full story here: Democrat senators Tammy Duckworth and Dick Durbin have called for an immediate investigation by the department for homeland security\u2019s inspector general into the agency\u2019s \u201cpotentially illegal implementation of President Trump\u2019s executive order\u201d. They called the orders \u201crushed and poorly drafted\u201d. The chaotic execution of this [Executive Order] \u2026 raises serious concerns in regard to whether taxpayer dollars were efficiently and effectively spent, rather than wasted on unwarranted and unjust detentions of lawful permanent residents (LPRs) and others who posed no security threat, and who had already been authorized by the United States Government to enter our country. We are deeply concerned by [Customs and Border Protection\u2019s] failure to respond to time-sensitive Congressional oversight inquiries and allegations that the agency refused to permit attorneys to meet with detained LPRs at O\u2019Hare and other airports across the country. Hollywood has voiced its disapproval of the Trump orders as film and television industry figures gathered for the Screen Actors Guild awards in Los Angeles. Mahershala Ali, who won the award for best supporting actor for his role in Moonlight, gave an emotional speech about acceptance and being a Muslim, while Julia Louis-Dreyfus called the ban \u201cun-American\u201d. My colleague in New York, Benjamin Lee, has just filed a report on the awards. You can read it here: The Indonesian foreign ministry has echoed comments by John McCain earlier that the Trump ban could damage the global fight against terror. Indonesia, the world\u2019s most populous Muslim nation, is not one of the seven Muslim countries affected by Trump\u2019s order. But ministry spokesman Armanatha Nasir said on Monday that Indonesia \u201cdeeply regrets\u201d the decision and believes it will have a \u201cnegative impact on global efforts to fight terrorism\u201d and the handling of refugees. It is wrong to associate radicalism and terrorism with a particular religion. Efforts to combat terrorism must be carried out by promoting international cooperation, including in addressing the root causes of terrorism. Michael Lynch, a reader, has just landed in O\u2019Hare Chicago airport from Heathrow and reports a large crowd. Perhaps inspired by the archbishop\u2019s comments ... Lots of pictures from Chicago on Twitter as well. An attack on a mosque in Quebec City in Canada has reportedly left five people dead. Details are only just beginning to emerge but read the story we have just posted on the site here: More pictures and videos from airport protests around the US \u2013 LA, Atlanta, San Diego and Philadelphia. Very strong statement condemning the orders from the Archbishop of Chicago, Cardinal Blase Cupich, who says it is a \u201cdark moment\u201d contrary to American values. The orders are \u201ccruel and chaotic\u201d, he says. This weekend proved to be a dark moment in US history. The executive order to turn away refugees and to close our nation to those, particularly Muslims, fleeing violence, oppression and persecution is contrary to both Catholic and American values. Have we not repeated the disastrous decisions of those in the past who turned away other people fleeing violence, leaving certain ethnicities and religions marginalized and excluded? We Catholics know that history well, for, like others, we have been on the other side of such decisions. These actions impose a sweeping and immediate halt on migrants and refugees from several countries, people who are suffering, fleeing for their lives. Their design and implementation have been rushed, chaotic, cruel and oblivious to the realities that will produce enduring security for the United States. They have left people holding valid visas and other proper documents detained in our airports, sent back to the places some were fleeing or not allowed to board planes headed here. Only at the eleventh hour did a federal judge intervene to suspend this unjust action. Read the full statement here. Despite that administration comment, it\u2019s fair to say there has been a lot of confusion about the scope of the orders. There have been numerous legal challenges \u2013 one is detailed here \u2013 and homeland secretary John Kelly was forced to issue a statement clarifying that green card holders were exempt from the ban after reports that some were prevented from getting into the US. His officials have issued a fact sheet to help us through the details. Main points are here: For the next 90 days, nearly all travelers, except US citizens, traveling from Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Iran, Somalia, Libya, and Yemen will be temporarily suspended from entry to the US. In that time a proper review and establishment of standards to prevent terrorist or criminal infiltration by foreign nationals will be carried out. \u201cLawful permanent residents\u201d of the US traveling on a valid I-551 (green cards) will be allowed to enter the US. In the first 30 days, DHS will perform a global country-by-country review of the information each country provides when their citizens apply for a US visa or immigration benefit. Countries will then have 60 days to comply with any requests from the US government to update or improve the quality of the information they provide. The countrys refugee admissions program will be temporarily suspended for the next 120 days while DHS and interagency partners review screening procedures to ensure refugees admitted in the future do not pose a security risk. An administration official, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, has called the orders a \u201cmassive success story\u201d. The official was reported as saying: Nothing has changed. All three of President Trump\u2019s executive orders remain in full effect and all three of President Trump\u2019s executive orders are being enforced by the departments of state, homeland security, justice and all other relative agencies across the federal government. So it really is a massive success story in terms of implementation on every single level. Thanks for the contributions so far. Here is a picture from Gareth Rogers showing the protest at Detroit airport. This was sent to my colleague @ambiej via Twitter showing the scene at Bradley international airport near Hartford, Connecticut. But not everyone reading the blog is of one mind. An email from a reader signing off as Georgina Heinrich says that \u201cmost working people\u201d in the US welcome the crackdown and that it was \u201cabout time the US looked after its own border control\u201d. Plenty to debate there. Gregg Popovich, the San Antonio Spurs head coach and consistent Trump critic, has called the immigration order \u201clike the Keystone Kops\u201d. As you know, I have lots of thoughts about what we\u2019ve done to ourselves as country and what we\u2019ve allowed to happen. But we\u2019ll see where this goes. Obviously the roll-out today was Keystone Kops-like by any measure with objectivity. Whether you want to say it\u2019s good or bad is irrelevant. But it was keystone Kops and that\u2019s scary. An Iranian man who holds a US visa who was barred entry to LA airport in the wake of the Trump ban has won a court injunction \u201cstaying his removal from the US, and ordering his release from the custody of the Department of Homeland Security\u201d. Ali Khoshbakhti Vayeghan brought the case at the US district court in California after being sent back to Dubai. From there he was to be removed to Iran. But the federal judge Dolly Gee found that the ban \u201cviolates the Establishment Clause, the Immigration and Nationality Act, and his rights to Equal Protection guaranteed by the United States Constitution\u201d. It ordered the the homeland department to allow him back into the US. Read the full ruling here. Trump has repeatedly sugested that safe havens for people displaced by conflict in Syria and Yemen is the way to contain the Middle East refugee crisis. The White House said on Sunday that King Salman of Saudi Arabia has agreed to support safe zones in Syria and Yemen after he spoke to the president, according to Associated Press. The president \u201crequested and the King agreed\u201d to support the safe zones \u201cas well as supporting other ideas to help the many refugees who are displaced by the ongoing conflicts\u201d, AP reported the White House as saying. The pair also reportedly discussed what the White House described as an invitation from Salman for Trump to lead \u201ca Middle East effort to defeat terrorism\u201d and help build \u201ca new future, economically and socially, for the people of the kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the region.\u201d Trump has criticised Arab nations for failing to do enough to contain the threat of Islamic State. John Kasich, Ohio governor and one of the dozen or more candidates beaten by Trump to the Republican nomination, has called the order \u201cham-handed\u201d and questioned why White House officials had allowed it to be issued. He told the Washington Post: In probably many Arab capitals today, people are like, \u2018What is America doing?\u2019 Frankly, when I look at this, I think he was ill-served by his staff. If I were the president, I\u2019d be very upset with the staff \u2014 that they didn\u2019t say, \u2018Hey, wait hold on a second.\u2019 Because that\u2019s what executives do. They have people around them that help them to understand, \u2018Hey, your message is fine, but here is what\u2019s going to come from it.\u2019 Thanks Amber. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and I\u2019ll be taking you through the next few hours of news and reaction surrounding the Trump immigration order. Thanks for all the reader contributions so far at @ambiej You can also send them now to me \u2013 @MartinFarrer \u2013 or on my email at martin.farrer@theguardian.com First up, our US west coast video producer, Adithya Sambamurthy has been at San Francisco airport where protesters have reportedly blocked one of the departure gates, amid chants of \u201cno ban, no wall\u201d and \u201clet them in\u201d. Looks like there are a lot of folks at the #sfoprotest. I especially like the \u201ceat hummus\u201d banner. Thousands of people have turned up at rallies across the country to protest Donald Trump\u2019s travel executive order. Huge crowds, including Chelsea Clinton, protested in Battery Park in New York City. Thousands turned out at Boston\u2019s Copley Square. In DC, protesters chanted \u201cshame\u201d outside the White House. Hundreds are still protesting at LAX Airport in Los Angeles. Protests have also taken place in dozens of smaller cities and towns, including Rochester, NY, at Minneapolis\u2212Saint Paul International Airport, Dulles Airport in Virginia, Albuquerque, NM and Pittsburgh, PA. High-profile Republicans, including Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham, have criticized the executive order, calling for it to be immediately changed. Donald Trump called the pair \u201csadly weak on immigration\u201d on Twitter after their public criticisms. Trump also released a statement declaring that his order is \u201cnot a Muslim ban\u201d and \u201cnot about religion\u201d, although all seven countries on the banned list are Muslim-majority. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said that green-card holders will be allowed entry into the country. People stranded by the ban have told stories of families and relationships being kept apart (often after years of waiting for visas to be approved) and job and school opportunities missed. Iranians stranded by US ban tell of jobs at risk and families in disarray. US Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly announced that green-card holders from the seven Muslim-majority countries affected by Trump\u2019s executive order travel ban will be allowed to enter the country. He said in a statement: In applying the provisions of the president\u2019s executive order, I hereby deem the entry of lawful permanent residents to be in the national interest. Accordingly, absent the receipt of significant derogatory information indicating a serious threat to public safety and welfare, lawful permanent resident status will be a dispositive factor in our case-by-case determinations. This in from Associated Press, Canada will offer temporary residency permits to any trapped travelers: Canada\u2019s immigration minister says the country will offer temporary residency permits to travelers who become stranded here by President Donald Trump\u2019s order banning travelers from seven Muslim-majority nations. Ahmed Hussen is a Somali refugee who was recently named Canada\u2019s new immigration minister. He said Sunday no one is currently stranded at the country\u2019s airports by the ban. Republican congressman Justin Amash from Michigan says in a Facebook post it is \u201cnot lawful\u201d to ban immigrants based on their nationality or place of birth. New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman demanded in a letter to the Department of Homeland Security and Customs that they \u201cdescribe specific steps they are taking to ensure compliance\u201d with the Brooklyn federal court\u2019s injunction on Trump\u2019s executive order. \u201cMy office is receiving alarming reports that DHS and CBP are not complying with the federal injunction and restraining order and are instead planning to remove from the United States individuals specifically protected by the terms of the federal court order\u201d, said Schneiderman. From photographer Jasper Rischen at Los Angeles\u2019 LAX Airport: From a Guardian reader in Bloomington, IN, who noticed a cheeky Donald Trump and Theresa May poster. From a reader in DC: From a reader in Pittsburgh: Guardian reporter Sabrina Siddiqui at the White House rally in DC on Sunday against Trump\u2019s travel ban: Afnan Mossaad, a native of Texas whose parents are from Egypt, said she was in disbelief not just as a Muslim but as an American. \u201cThis is not America. These are not the American values that we all know and love\u201d, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s time that we speak up. We can\u2019t let him redefine America,\u201d she added of Trump. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to resist. When there\u2019s injustice, you\u2019ve got to stand up for what\u2019s right. This is democracy.\u201d Heidi Obermeyer, a Colorado native working in DC, said her grandfather had fled Nazi persecution in Germany and went on to live the American Dream. \u201cI think that it\u2019s really important that the United States continue to be about standing up for freedom and opportunity for people around the world who are being persecuted,\u201d she said. Obermeyer said felt compelled to show her support for the protest in order \u201cto send a message that America is a welcoming place even if the current administration isn\u2019t.\u201d Dominick Pugliese, a history teacher at a local high school, directed his message not at Trump but at Paul Ryan. \u201cI know that he knows better than this,\u201d Pugliese said of the House speaker, who backed Trump\u2019s executive order on Friday. \u201cPeople like [Steve] Bannon and Kellyanne Conway, the horsemen and horsewomen of the apocalypse, that\u2019s one thing,\u201d he said. \u201cPaul Ryan knows America\u2019s values and is not only being silent, but supporting this. It\u2019s horrible.\u201d Heather Mcilhany said Trump\u2019s ban was \u201cignorant and counterproductive.\u201d \u201cWe have to stand up before someone comes for us,\u201d she said. \u201cOther than Native Americans, there\u2019s none of us who did not come here as immigrants.\u201d Interesting article by David French in National Review attempting to break down Trump\u2019s executive order by noting that while the ban on green card holders is \u201cmadness\u201d, most of Trump\u2019s proposals are far more moderate than originally promised - and not that different from Obama\u2019s refugee policies: So, what did Trump do? Did he implement his promised Muslim ban? No, far from it. He backed down dramatically from his campaign promises and instead signed an executive order dominated mainly by moderate refugee restrictions and temporary provisions aimed directly at limiting immigration from jihadist conflict zones. ... While the Syrian Civil War was raging, ISIS was rising, and refugees were swamping Syria\u2019s neighbors and surging into Europe, the Obama administration let in less than a trickle of refugees. Only in the closing days of his administration did President Obama reverse course \u2014 in numbers insufficient to make a dent in the overall crisis, by the way \u2014 and now the Democrats have the audacity to tweet out pictures of bleeding Syrian children? Read the rest here. From deputy news editor Paul Owen at New York City\u2019s rally on Sunday in Battery Park: Fauzia Khanani said her family had come from Uganda as refugees to Canada and then moved to the US when she was one year old. She said she was protesting against the travel ban in New York\u2019s Battery Park - within sight of the Statue of Liberty - because \u201cI\u2019m a Muslim, I\u2019m a product of refugees, I\u2019m a naturalised citizen. I\u2019m appalled and scared and angry and I\u2019m sad about what\u2019s happening and the people that support it but when I come to a place like this,\u201dshe said of the protest, \u201cit gives me hope\u201d. Debbie Meisenzahl said she was at the protest in lower Manhattan \u201cto stand up for my fellow New Yorkers against... I want to say a bad word right now. BS - I\u2019ll say the short version.\u201d She said that Trump\u2019s policy was disproportionate when there were \u201cjust a few bad apples\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s not what America stands for,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re all immigrants or descended from immigrants. Asked about the Statue of Liberty, whose image she was displaying on a poster, she said: \u201cWe stand with her.\u201d Meisenzahl said a Yemeni man had recently helped her and her father when he had to move out of his building and said of Trump\u2019s travel ban on seven countries including Yemen: \u201cIt\u2019s such a travesty.\u201d Irina Teveleva, who was carrying a sign that said \u201cOur New York is immigrant New York\u201d, said she had moved from Moscow to America and was now a student at Columbia University. She said: \u201cAll the opportunities I\u2019ve had in this country, I feel really lucky and grateful. I want to stand up for other immigrants.\u201d The chairman of the Senate\u2019s Foreign Relations Committee, Republican Senator Bob Corker from Tennessee, criticized Trump\u2019s executive order on immigration calling it \u201cpoorly implemented\u201d and said it should be \u201cimmediately\u201d reviewed: \u201cWe all share a desire to protect the American people, but this executive order has been poorly implemented, especially with respect to green card holders,\u201d Corker said, according to USA Today. \u201cThe administration should immediately make appropriate revisions, and it is my hope that following a thorough review and implementation of security enhancements that many of these programs will be improved and reinstated\u201d said Corker. Guardian reporter Lauren Gambino from DC\u2019s rally against Trump\u2019s travel ban: The march descended on the Capitol chanting, \u201cdo your job\u201d at the mostly absent Congress. (It\u2019s a Sunday, after all!). Jennifer Rodriguez, the daughter of Cuban refugees, marched with them, wearing a pink \u201cpussyhat\u201d from last weekend\u2019s march. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine what would have happened if President Kennedy at that time had decided to do what Trump is doing\u2014 to just send them back,\u201d she said, her voice swelling with emotion. \u201cThey would have been killed.\u201d Rodriguez said she was appalled by the actions the new administration has taken and vowed to continue to protest Trump and his agenda. \u201cI\u2019ll be here every weekend if that\u2019s what it takes,\u201d she said as the crowd converged on the Capitol lawn. Like Rodriguez, several people had signs that said \u201cchild of refugees\u201d and \u201cnation of immigrants. Many carried signs with the words from the Statue of Liberty that have for generations represented America\u2019s welcoming of immigrants: \u201cGive me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.\u201d For those who wondered if the Women\u2019s March on Washington would translate into a movement, the spontaneous protest on Sunday, which attracted hundreds if not thousands of people, was a positive sign. Anjali Singh, who heard about the protest on Facebook last night and came with her friends, said she felt empowered by the rally and already plans to attend future ones. But still, she couldn\u2019t help but to wonder if it was making a difference. \u201cI want to see action, I want to see policy changes,\u201d she said. Her friend, Zulakha Iqbal said she felt it was important to show up and make her voice heard. \u201cI\u2019ll be protesting until the next election cycle - until at least 2018,\u201d Iqbal said. \u201cThat\u2019s the whole point, keeping up the momentum.\u201d After about twenty minutes of chanting in front of the Capitol, the protestors began to disperse for the evening. Congress representatives are fighting against Border and Customs Patrol officials at Washington Dulles Airport in Virginia, after dozens of people reportedly remain detained despite last night\u2019s court order putting a stay on Trump\u2019s executive order. Representative Don Beyer is at the airport, with Congress colleagues Gerry Connolly and Jamie Raskin. From a Huffington Post reporter, who tweeted that he was told 16 people were detained off one flight from Turkey. Footage from the airport shows Congressman Connelly speaking with border control, and when Dulles Airport Police is mentioned, he replied: \u201cAnd I want them to know I\u2019m going to be a pain in the ass\u201d. A veteran-led rally will be held at 7pm at the Dulles airport tonight. From the rally\u2019s press release: Army Captain Matt Zeller, co-founder of No One Left Behind, which resettles translators and others who helped American forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, stated that his organization has received over 500 messages from Afghans and Iraqis currently trapped abroad, hunted by the Taliban and ISIS for supporting our war effort, desperate to get to safety, and terrified America will slam the door closed. \u201cWithout Janis, my translator, I would not be alive today,\u201d said Captain Zeller. \u201cI would have been killed by two Taliban fighters in the hills of Afghanistan and not fighting for interpreters\u2019 rights today. President Trump\u2019s order permanently harms our national security. It pains me to think how many U.S. soldiers will now die in future wars because we couldn\u2019t recruit the local support that is often the difference between life and death.\u201d Continuing on Trump, he\u2019s now taken to Twitter to slam Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham, Republicans who criticized his executive order as more likely to help Isis than stop terrorists. Just in contrast to Donald Trump\u2019s claim that his travel ban executive order is \u201cnot a Muslim ban\u201d, my colleague Ben Jacobs reminded us of Trump\u2019s statement from December, 2015: Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country\u2019s representatives can figure out what is going on. According to Pew Research, among others, there is great hatred towards Americans by large segments of the Muslim population. Most recently, a poll from the Center for Security Policy released data showing \u201c25% of those polled agreed that violence against Americans here in the United States is justified as a part of the global jihad\u201d and 51% of those polled, \u201cagreed that Muslims in America should have the choice of being governed according to Shariah.\u201d Shariah authorizes such atrocities as murder against non-believers who won\u2019t convert, beheadings and more unthinkable acts that pose great harm to Americans, especially women. Mr. Trump stated, \u201cWithout looking at the various polling data, it is obvious to anybody the hatred is beyond comprehension. Where this hatred comes from and why we will have to determine. Until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in Jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for human life. If I win the election for President, we are going to Make America Great Again. A statement just in from Donald Trump, saying that his executive order is \u201cnot about religion.\u201d The president says his order it is \u201cnot a Muslim ban\u201d but instead \u201csimilar\u201d to former president Obama\u2019s policy on refugees from Iraq. This is the full statement: America is a proud nation of immigrants and we will continue to show compassion to those fleeing oppression, but we will do so while protecting our own citizens and border. America has always been the land of the free and home of the brave. We will keep it free and keep it safe, as the media knows, but refuses to say. My policy is similar to what President Obama did in 2011 when he banned visas for refugees from Iraq for six months. The seven countries named in the Executive Order are the same countries previously identified by the Obama administration as sources of terror. To be clear, this is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting. This is not about religion - this is about terror and keeping our country safe. There are over 40 different countries worldwide that are majority Muslim that are not affected by this order. We will again be issuing visas to all countries once we are sure we have reviewed and implemented the most secure policies over the next 90 days. I have tremendous feeling for the people involved in this horrific humanitarian crisis in Syria. My first priority will always be to protect and serve our country, but as president I will find ways to help all those who are suffering. Guardian reporter Edward Helmore from JFK airport in New York City: Around three pm, Iranian Iman Alknfushe\u200e, a US permanent legal resident who had been held since early Saturday, was released to her family. Her release followed that of Iranian student Bahide Rasekhikollkdragh earlier in the day. Congressman Hakeem Jeffries \u200eof New York said to his knowledge around \u201cfour or five\u201d people were still being detained at JFK, down from 13 at late Saturday. The number was fluid because as some were released, still more arrived including four Somali Americans overnight. They are understood to be permanent legal residents. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to move people from what we believe is unlawful detention as expeditiously as possible\u201d he said. Jeffries described a complex system of court rulings, directives from the Department of Homeland security and the administration. \u201cThe local border patrol has been relatively cooperative. However the White House chief of staff said today that executive order does not apply to permanent legal residents. But even his interpretation is inaccurate. There are are multiple permanent legal residents being detained, in some cases for more than 30 hours.\u201d Jeffries said it was obvious the White House had put out inaccurate information based on what we\u2019re seeing. \u201cThere are legal residents who have been unlawfully detained in their home country. End of story. We\u2019ve seen it time and again,\u201d he said. The congressman also expressed concern that lawful US residents were being denied permission to return. \u201cThere is a couple in Jordan, one of whom is a green card holder, who are being prevented from board\u200eing a flight.\u201d Britons holding dual citizenship with any of the seven Muslim-majority countries listed as suspended by the United States will still be allowed to enter the US, says the Foreign Office. A statement from the Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson says that after conversations with the US government, the department can confirm the following (direct from its statement): The presidential executive order only applies to individuals travelling from one of the seven named countries. If you are travelling to the US from anywhere other than one of those countries (for instance, the UK) the executive order does not apply to you and you will experience no extra checks regardless of your nationality or your place of birth. If you are a UK national who happens to be travelling from one of those countries to the US, then the order does not apply to you \u2013 even if you were born in one of those countries. If you are a dual citizen of one of those countries travelling to the US from OUTSIDE those countries then the order does not apply to you. The only dual nationals who might have extra checks are those coming from one of the seven countries themselves \u2013 for example a UK-Libya dual national coming from Libya to the US. Chelsea Clinton, daughter of Hillary and Bill, is at the New York rally against the immigration ban. Dozens of rallies across the country continue to attract thousands protesting Donald Trump\u2019s executive order restricting travel. Guardian readers tweeted us from Boston\u2019s rally in Copley Square: From a Guardian reader in Rochester, New York: https://twitter.com/GrandREvans/status/825791520812986368 From Sabrina Siddiqui at the DC rally: Hundreds of protesters gathered outside the White House began marching toward the US Capitol, many clutching signs that read \u201cRefugees welcome\u201d. They chanted a call and response of \u201cWhat do you want -- justice? When do you want it -- now\u201d, while others still standing outside the White House gates simply shouted \u201cShame\u201d. A Guardian reader sent this pic from outside the new Trump hotel in DC: Guardian reporter Sabrina Siddiqui sent this update from the DC rally: Hundreds of protesters gathered outside the White House began marching toward the US Capitol, many clutching signs that read \u201cRefugees welcome\u201d. They chanted a call and response of \u201cWhat do you want -- justice? When do you want it -- now\u201d, while others still standing outside the White House gates simply shouted \u201cShame\u201d. From a Guardian reader outside the Minneapolis\u2212Saint Paul International Airport in Minnesota: From a reader at San Francisco\u2019s airport rally: Are you at a rally? Please tweet photos, news and videos to me at @ambiej. Many leaders in the tech industry came out strongly against Trump\u2019s executive order which bans refugees and suspends entry for visa-holders from seven Muslim-majority countries. As Edward Helmore reports: Executives at major tech companies that rely on foreign skilled labour also expressed concern. In a memo to staff, Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said it had been \u201cpainful to see the personal cost\u201d on our colleagues. The tech giant\u2019s USSR-born co-founder, Sergei Brin, attended the protest at San Francisco\u2019s airport, telling reporters he was there in a personal capacity, \u201cbecause I am a refugee\u201d. Apple head Tim Cook said in an email to employees that he had contacted the White House to explain the \u201cnegative effect\u201d of the restrictions, and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, an Indian immigrant, described in an online post \u201cthe positive impact that immigration has on our company, for the country, and for the world\u201d. The tech world focused fundraising efforts for ACLU, which led the legal challenge against Trump\u2019s executie order. Car-ride company Lyft co-founders announced the company would donation $1 million to the ACLU over the next four years to help its working defending the constitution. The popular game Dots installed a pop-up in its app, declaring it welcomes \u201cplayers from all over the world\u201d , with a \u201csupport now\u201d button linking directly to the ACLU donation page. Many tech types took to Twitter to offer to match ACLU donations, taking over from each other as soon as each total was reached. Dominik Hofmann, the founder of Vine and Byte, offered to match ACLU donations up to $50,000 Saturday night, with dozens of people sending receipts for donations ranging from $10 to thousands of dollars. A combined $116,000 was donated, tweeted Hofmann. Steven Frank from Panic matched donations to $10,000, raising that amount in one hour. Eoghan McCabe, CEO and co-founder of Intercom, offered to match up to $50k on Sunday, as did Patrick Collison from Stripe. Outside of the tech world, singer Sia and actor Rosie O\u2019Donnell both offered to meet ACLU donations up to $100,000. From Guardian reporter Lauren Gambino at the anti-travel ban rally outside the White House: Hundreds of protesters with American flags, homemade signs and placards from last weekend\u2019s women\u2019s march are walking down Pennsylvania Ave toward the White House chanting: Shame. Protesters are reacting to the executive orders signed by the new president Donald Trump this week to start building a wall along the southern border and a draconian measure to halt immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries. The impromptu rally follows similar scenes at airports around the country, where green card holders were detained and barred from entering. Boos rang out and a number of middle fingers went up as the marchers in DC passed Trump international hotel along Pennsylvania Ave, chanting \u201crefugees are welcome here\u201d. Customs and Border Protection agents defied the orders of federal judges regarding Donald Trump\u2019s travel bans on Sunday, according to attorneys who rallied popular protests around the country in support of detained refugees and travellers from seven Muslim-majority countries. \u201cRogue customs and Border Patrol agents continue to try to get people on to planes,\u201d Becca Heller, director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, told reporters on Sunday. \u201cA lot of people have been handcuffed, a lot of people who don\u2019t speak English are being coerced into taking involuntary departures.\u201d Agents told attorneys \u201cit\u2019s not going to happen\u201d at Dulles international airport in Virginia on Sunday, as they tried to see detainees, according to Damon Silvers, special counsel at AFL-CIO, one of the legal groups trying to help visa holders in detention or threatened with deportation. Late Saturday night, federal judges in New York, Virginia and Massachusetts ordered a temporary halt to the president\u2019s deportation of people who had arrived in the US with valid visas. The USA men\u2019s soccer captain, Michael Bradley, has attacked Donald Trump\u2019s executive order, which bans travel to the US from seven Muslim-majority countries. When Trump won the presidential election in November, Bradley said it was important \u201cto give our president support\u201d. However, Trump\u2019s latest decision caused Bradley to speak out in an interview with Sports Illustrated\u2019s Grant Wahl and then on his Instagram page. \u201cA few hours ago ago I gave an interview to Grant Wahl,\u201d wrote Bradley, who has made more than 125 appearances for the men\u2019s national team. Read the rest of the story here. The Iranian-born BBC reporter who was stopped at immigration today upon arriving at a US airport today, Ali Hamedani, has been allowed to enter - but had his phone and computer searched. Reporters Saeed Kamali Dehghan, Cathy Otten, Alice Ross and Kareem Shaheen have been collecting stories from people all over the world affected by the ban: Employee of an international airline at Dubai airport We\u2019ve had no written instructions yet from the US, at least not on the frontline, and the instructions that we have received don\u2019t mention dual nationality or green cards \u2013 it\u2019s very unclear what to do. Some people are being stopped, while others are being given the benefit of the doubt. So if, for example, a passenger is Syrian holding a US passport we\u2019re turning a blind eye \u2013 we\u2019re pretending we haven\u2019t seen the Syrian passport. One passenger stuck in the airport here is a Syrian green card holder who was denied boarding. Her family, her job, her whole life is in the US and when she asks us when we will allow her to go home, none of us know what to say. Unfortunately because she\u2019s Syrian it\u2019s difficult for her to get a visa for Dubai and it\u2019s difficult for her to go elsewhere. At the moment her chances of getting into the US depend on which airport she goes to. If she\u2019s landing in New York they\u2019ll send her back, if it\u2019s Houston they might accept her \u2013 what we\u2019ve found is it really depends on which shift is operating; it\u2019s not even a standard airport policy. Last I heard they were trying any airport as long as she gets to US soil, and then at least once she\u2019s there she can create a legal challenge or manage her way in instead of being stuck in Dubai. Read other stories from individuals affected by the Trump travel ban here. Republican Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham released a joint statement condemning the Trump\u2019s travel ban executive order, declaring it \u201cnot properly vetted\u201d and saying it will likely aide terrorist groups by telling people that the US shuns Muslims. The statement reads: Our government has a responsibility to defend our borders, but we must do so in a way that makes us safer and upholds all that is decent and exceptional about our nation. It is clear from the confusion at our airports across the nation that President Trump\u2019s executive order was not properly vetted. We are particularly concerned by reports that this order went into effect with little to no consultation with the Departments of State, Defense, Justice, and Homeland Security. Such a hasty process risks harmful results. We should not stop green-card holders from returning to the country they call home. We should not stop those who have served as interpreters for our military and diplomats from seeking refuge in the country they risked their lives to help. And we should not turn our backs on those refugees who have been shown through extensive vetting to pose no demonstrable threat to our nation, and who have suffered unspeakable horrors, most of them women and children. Ultimately, we fear this executive order will become a self-inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism. At this very moment, American troops are fighting side-by-side with our Iraqi partners to defeat ISIL. But this executive order bans Iraqi pilots from coming to military bases in Arizona to fight our common enemies. Our most important allies in the fight against ISIL are the vast majority of Muslims who reject its apocalyptic ideology of hatred. This executive order sends a signal, intended or not, that America does not want Muslims coming into our country. That is why we fear this executive order may do more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security. This just in from Sabrina Siddiqui, a Guardian reporter at the DC protest: Thousands of people are now attending rallies in cities across the country. A rally in Battery Park, in lower Manhattan, New York City, has just begun: The official NYC subway account has been tweeting subway updates in anticipation of the large crowds: Hundreds gather on the steps of the Rhode Island state house in Providence, RI. Boston\u2019s Copley Square looks full: A crowd of a few hundred students have gathered to protest in the scenic grounds of the University of Virginia: Large crowds also gathered outside the White House in DC: Are you at a anti-travel ban rally? Please tweet photos, news and video from the rallies to me at @ambiej. Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy promises to introduce a bill to overturn Trump\u2019s executive order this week, although since Congress and the Senate are both Republican controlled it has very little to no chance of passing. The president of Columbia University, Lee Bollinger, emailed all staff and students of the university last night speaking out against Trump\u2019s travel ban, noting the impact it will have on the academic community. While it seems no Columbia University staff have been caught up so far, many other academics and students from other universities have been amongst those stopped from entering. In the email published at Columbia Spectator, Bollinger wrote: An estimated 17,000 international students in the U.S. are from the seven nations covered by the entry ban. Scholars planning to travel to the United States for meetings and conferences at our colleges and universities will effectively be barred from attending. If this order stands, there is the certainty of a profound impact on our University community, which is committed to welcoming students, faculty, and staff from around the world, as well as across the nation. As I have said on many occasions, it is critically important that the University, as such, not take stands on ideological or political issues. Yet it is also true that the University, as an institution in the society, must step forward to object when policies and state action conflict with its fundamental values, and especially when they bespeak purposes and a mentality that are at odds with our basic mission. This is such a case. Reporter Alice Ross has been speaking to people affected by the travel ban, and people suddenly being cut off from those they love is a recurrent theme. She spoke to a gay US citizen who was tantalizingly close to being able to bring his Iranian fianc\u00e9 to the US: I am a US citizen by birth and a gay male. When travelling in Iran as a tourist I met a Kurdish Iranian, also a gay male and we fell in love. I applied for a K1 Fianc\u00e9 Visa and my petition was approved. Last November we travelled to Turkey where my fianc\u00e9 had his interview at the US Embassy in Ankara. After two months of processing and vetting the visa was approved three days before President Trump took office. When I heard the news about the executive order, I wanted to vomit. If my fianc\u00e9 stays in Iran he will never be able to live freely and could be executed for his sexual orientation. Our concern is that we\u2019re going to miss the window of opportunity to get the visa - we only have until mid-April - which would mean we\u2019d have to begin the process all over again. It\u2019s so frustrating because we thought we\u2019d made it, that we\u2019d actually succeeded in demonstrating to the government that we had a legitimate relationship\u2026 We were celebrating. We were to meet in Istanbul in March, send his passport to the embassy to get the visa, and enjoy some time together in Turkey before he finishes his Masters. Then he was going to fly here and it was going to be a happy ever after kind of story. And now the whole bottom has dropped out of everything. An Iranian-born BBC reporter is currently stuck in immigration in Chicago airport, and is posting updates on Twitter about being taken to a waiting room. Hundreds of people already in Copley Square, Boston, for a rally against the travel ban executive order. From a WBUR (Boston\u2019s NPR affiliate) reporter: From a Boston Globe reporter: A local TV network is flying over the rally, with live video showing huge crowds and packed streets. The rally started at 1pm. Earlier on Sunday Trump spokeswoman Kellyanne Conway falsely told Fox News Sunday that Saturday night\u2019s stay decision by a New York federal judge \u201cdoesn\u2019t really affect the executive order\u201d. \u201cThe judge in Brooklyn, the Obama appointee judge in Brooklyn\u2019s stay of order really doesn\u2019t affect the executive order at all, because the executive order is meant to be prospective,\u201d she told host Chris Wallace. \u201cIt\u2019s preventing not detaining,\u201d she said. Not all aspects of the executive order are covered by the Brooklyn judge\u2019s decision, but it does stop deportations. She also said she understood what it was like to be stopped at airports but that it was a small price to pay for national security. \u201cI was stopped many times ... after 9/11,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t resemble, or share a name with, or be part of any kind of terrorist conspiracy, but this is what we do to keep a nation safe.\u201d Just remember that Conway is a blonde white US-born American woman. Nesrine Malik, a Sudanese-born writer who lives in London, writes about the personal impact of the travel ban: I now cannot travel to the US, a country I visit frequently and in which I have work interests, close family and dear friends. It is a curious feeling, a new feeling. One that collapses space-time and connects you to all those before you who have found themselves on the ugly end of a collective insanity. It is a feeling that rocks the very ground on which you thought we all stood. Suddenly, all certainties look shaky. Residencies, passports, green cards, jobs, mortgages, friends, marriages \u2013 all the things you thought fortified you against the mobilisation of state machinery \u2013 dissolve. You are only a Muslim. And what does that mean? It is a tag that defies definition, becoming more elusive the more you try to pin it down. I was reminded of a scene from a dramatisation of Roots author Alex Haley\u2019s life, when he, dressed proudly in his US Coast Guard uniform and sporting his medals, confidently asks for a hotel room for the night for him and his wife. When he is refused one for being black, he returns to his car enraged \u2013 not at those who denied him but at himself for thinking he was exempt. \u201cAll they saw was a monkey.\u201d Read the rest here. Kim Kardashian, who backed Hillary Clinton during the election, is also getting politically involved with the travel ban by tweeting statistics to her 49 million followers. From Guardian US data editor Mona Chalabi: Senator John McCain spoke publicly about his concern that Trump\u2019s travel ban could aid Islamic State by giving it more reasons to encourage its supporters to fight against the US. \u201cI think the effect will probably in some areas give Isis some more propaganda,\u201d McCain said in an interview with CBS\u2019s Face the Nation. McCain, chair of the Senate armed services committee and a Republican from Arizona, added that he was \u201cvery concerned about our effect on the Iraqis right now\u201d. He noted that former CIA director David Petraeus is \u201cvery concerned\u201d for local translators who worked for the US military, who often do the job specifically in the hope of receiving a visa to the US. After the travel ban, a former military translator, Iraqi Hameed Khalid Darweesh, was among those stopped at JFK airport this weekend and initially refused entry. With thousands expected at protests around the country against Trump\u2019s executive order... Wondering if your senator backs or criticizes the travel ban executive order? This Google document shows listssenators alphabetically, noting whether they have opposed or remained silent to the ban, any link or public statement about it and the dates they will be up for re-election. It also includes contact information, such as their office address, phone number and online contact details. The document shows, for example, Senator Jeff Flake from Arizona, a Republican, has spoken out publicly against the ban, while Senator Jon Tester, a Democrat from Montana, has made no statement. Only a day after casting airports around the US into confusion and hours after his first defeat in federal court, Donald Trump and his advisers flew into a defense of his vague and chaotically enforced ban on travel from seven Muslim-majority countries. Trump\u2019s chief of staff, Reince Priebus, however, appeared to concede ground when he said the ban would no longer apply to green-card holders. Appearing on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press on Sunday, Priebus said 325,000 travellers had entered the US on Saturday and 109 were detained. \u201cMost of those people were moved out,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a couple dozen more that remain and I would suspect that as long as they\u2019re not awful people that they will move through before another half a day today.\u201d In an abrupt, apparent change from the White House\u2019s original policy, Priebus said the order would no longer affect green-card holders. But he also suggested that \u201cother countries\u201d may \u201cneed to be added\u201d to the travel ban. \u201cMaybe some of those people should be detained,\u201d he said, although valid visa holders have already passed through an arduous screening and interview process. Read the rest of the story here. From the Guardian\u2019s Ireland correspondent: St Patrick\u2019s Day and the annual \u201chooley\u201d at the White House to celebrate Ireland\u2019s national day could pose embarrassment for some of the Irish political parties that normally attend the Washington DC celebrations on 17 March. The leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party, Colum Eastwood, confirmed on Sunday that he will boycott Donald Trump\u2019s hosting of the shamrock-tinged shindig this year. Speaking ahead of Theresa May\u2019s visit to Dublin on Monday where she will hold Brexit talks with the taoiseach, Enda Kenny, Eastwood said the Trump travel ban underpinned his decision not to attend this year\u2019s St Patrick\u2019s Day party in the White House. He said it was up to other political parties both in Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic to decide if they thought it was right to attend the annual party. Eastwood said: \u201cThe worst fears about the Trump presidency are coming to fruition. These immigration bans are a method of designed discrimination against one religion. \u201cThis US presidency is not normal, therefore normal diplomatic niceties should not apply. I would urge the Irish government to take every step possible to ensure that these discriminatory checks and bans are not enforced at our airports. We should have no hand, act or part in implementing this ban,\u201d said Eastwood. Kenny is expected to accept the new US president\u2019s invitation to the traditional St Patrick\u2019s Day celebrations but the Irish foreign minister has expressed deep concern over the travel ban. Charlie Flanagan said he would be raising the ban during his visit to Washington next week. \u201cWhile US immigration policy is a matter for the US authorities, it is clear that the most recent decisions could have far-reaching implications \u2013 both on humanitarian grounds and on relations between the US and the global Muslim community,\u201d the Flanagan said. Good morning from New York City, where rallies will take place throughout the US today in response to the executive order signed by the president on Friday banning refugees and suspending visas from residents of seven Muslim-majority countries. At 1pm ET, a huge rally is expected in Copley Square, Boston, hosted by CAIR Massachusetts. Over 16,000 people marked themselves as attending on the Facebook event. It will be held at \u201cat the site of the Khalil Gibran Plaque - Gibran was an immigrant from Lebanon\u201d, reads the event description. At 2pm a large rally is expected at Battery Park in lower Manhattan, hosted by the New York Immigration Coalition. Over 9,500 people have marked themselves as attending on Facebook. Thousands are expected to descend on the White House in DC at 1pm to protest the ban, with 13,000 people on Facebook saying they will attend the \u201cNo Muslim Ban\u201d rally hosted by the group Peace for Iran. Most major cities have a rally planned, and smaller rallies are expected all over the country, including Portland, ME, Reno, NV, Boise ID. Check out this Facebook post which shows all the currently planned rallies and their respective Facebook event page. Are you at a rally in protest of Trump\u2019s executive order today? Please tweet us pictures, news and video of the event at @ambiej! That is it from me. Thanks for all your comments and suggestions. My colleague Amber Jamieson in the Guardian\u2019s US will be taking over from here. Guardian political editor Anushka Asthana has a bit more on the statement from No 10. She says Boris Johnson will speak to two of Trump\u2019s most senior advisers, Steve Bannon and Jared Kushner, and make it clear the UK wants an exemption from this travel ban for its citizens. The Press Association has just filed this: Prime minister Theresa May has ordered the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, and the home secretary, Amber Rudd, to telephone their American counterparts to make representations about the US travel ban, Downing Street has said. According to the Guardian\u2019s political editor Anushka Asthana, Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Tory leader, has added her voice to calls for Trump\u2019s state visit to the UK to be cancelled. State visits are designed for both the host, and the head of state who is being hosted, to celebrate and entrench the friendships and shared values between their respective countries. A state visit from the current president of the United States could not possibly occur in the best traditions of the enterprise while a cruel and divisive policy which discriminates against citizens of the host nation is in place. I hope President Trump immediately reconsiders his Muslim ban. The scale of opposition to Trump\u2019s travel plan in the UK continues to grow. A petition to cancel a state visit by the US president, planned for later this year, had a couple of hundred signatures this morning. It now stands at over 300,000. Trump has tweeted again citing the deaths of Christians in the Middle East as justification for his travel ban. Priebus went on to say: \u201cPerhaps we need to take it further.\u201d Political reaction is starting to gather pace in the US. Reuters has this: White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, defended its implementation of Trump\u2019s executive action targeting immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries and said only two dozen travellers remain detained. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t chaos,\u201d Priebus said on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, adding that 325,000 travelers entered the United States on Saturday and 109 of them were detained. \u201cMost of those people were moved out. We\u2019ve got a couple dozen more that remain and I would suspect that as long as they\u2019re not awful people that they will move through before another half a day today,\u201d he said. A bit more from Reuters on those comments from Mitch McConnell, the Republican Senate majority leader. The US Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, a Republican, said the United States needs to \u201cbe careful\u201d while implementing President Donald Trump\u2019s new executive order targeting immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries. McConnell said on ABC\u2019s This Week program it was a good idea to tighten the vetting of immigrants, but \u201cI also think it\u2019s important to remember that some of our best sources in the war against radical Islamic terrorism, are Muslims, both in this country and overseas ... We need to be careful as we do this.\u201d According to Reuters, the Republican Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, has just said \u201cwe need to be careful\u201d while carrying out President Trump\u2019s order. According to CNN, Trump\u2019s travel ban on people from seven mainly Muslim countries may be just the start. It has just published a report that suggests the administration is considering asking all foreign visitors \u201cto disclose all websites and social media sites they visit, and to share the contacts in their cell phones\u201d. That sense of confusion \u2013 and fear \u2013 is clear in some of the conversations my colleague Alice Ross has been having with people caught up in the US travel ban. A Palestinian woman living in New York: I\u2019m an architect from the West Bank and I live in New York with my spouse, who holds American citizenship. I have my green card and planned to travel to Palestine this week to visit my family, who were very excited to see me. I also wanted to renew my passport, which is expiring soon. After hearing about yesterday\u2019s ban, we decided to cancel my flight until we have some clarity. It\u2019s true that Palestine is not on the list of banned countries but the fact that the order is so random and vague makes the situation scary. I am afraid if I travel and they expand the order, I will be in limbo and I will be living apart from my spouse for an unknown period. My family is so disappointed I\u2019m not going home, and I don\u2019t know what to do about my new passport. I\u2019ve also lost money by cancelling the flight. Right now everything is so vague and unclear. If they go ahead with these orders it will make the US a big prison where so many people will hate living here. I\u2019m just waiting and hoping for some clarity in the next few days, but I have no idea whether to just risk it and go to Palestine. It\u2019s a mess. And this from an employee at Dubai international airport gives a clear sense of the confusion among those trying to implement the ban: We\u2019ve had no written instructions yet from the US, at least not on the frontline, and the instructions that we have received don\u2019t mention dual nationality or green cards \u2013 it\u2019s very unclear what to do. So some people are stopped while others are being given the benefit of the doubt, so if, for example, a passenger is Syrian holding a US passport we\u2019re turning a blind eye, we\u2019re pretending we haven\u2019t seen the Syrian passport. One passenger stuck in the airport here is a Syrian green card holder who was denied boarding. Her family, her job, her whole life is in the US and when she asks us when we will allow her to go home, none of us know what to say. Unfortunately because she\u2019s Syrian it\u2019s difficult for her to get a visa for Dubai and it\u2019s difficult for her to go elsewhere. At the moment her chances of getting into the US depends on which airport she goes to. If she\u2019s landing in New York they\u2019ll send her back, if it\u2019s Houston they might accept her \u2013 what we\u2019ve found is it really depends on which shift is operating, it\u2019s not even a standard airport policy. Last I heard they were trying any airport as long as she gets to US soil, and then at least once she\u2019s there she can create a legal challenge or manage her way in instead of being stuck in Dubai. According to this piece from CNN there was a sense of confusion and chaos when Trump announced his executive order, with homeland security officials being unaware of the detail of the plan. When President Donald Trump declared at the Pentagon Friday he was enacting strict new measures to prevent domestic terror attacks, there were few within his government who knew exactly what he meant. Administration officials weren\u2019t immediately sure which countries\u2019 citizens would be barred from entering the United States. The Department of Homeland Security was left making a legal analysis on the order after Trump signed it. A Border Patrol agent, confronted with arriving refugees, referred questions only to the president himself, according to court filings. Afternoon summary Donald Trump\u2019s travel ban on people from seven Muslim-majority countries has provoked widespread protest and condemnation around the world. European leaders have expressed their opposition, saying it undermines the Geneva convention, weakens the US and boosts Islamic extremism. In a tweet, Trump defended the move \u2013 aimed at people from Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Somalia, Yemen and Libya \u2013 saying the US needed \u201cstrong borders\u201d. In the UK, Theresa May has been criticised for her initial refusal to condemn the ban. The government has now said it opposes the move and will defend the rights of UK nationals. However, May faces growing pressure to cancel a planned visit by the US president to the UK later this year. The British Olympian Sir Mo Farrah \u2013 who was born in Somalia and moved to the UK when he was eight \u2013 has condemned the ban. He said the decision came from a place of \u201cignorance and prejudice\u201d \u2013 adding that he will have to tell his children that he might not be able to come home to the US from his training camp in Ethiopia. The global reaction to Trump\u2019s travel ban continues. Our correspondent in Iraq Martin Chulov has just sent this: Iraq\u2019s government was being urged on Sunday to impose a reciprocal ban and said it was continuing to examine the ramifications of the visa decision. The foreign relations committee said it supported a similar ban on US citizens entering Iraq, while the Popular Mobilisation Units, an umbrella group of mainly Shia militias, called for the expulsion of US citizens currently in the country. Iraqi refugees who have been accepted into the US in the past decade have all been subjected to extensive vetting, involving interviews and background checks. Many have worked for the US military or government. There has been no official reaction to the announcement from Yemen, or Libya, which have each been ravaged by civil war and have no functioning central government. The Muslim Council of Britain has issued a statement condemning the travel ban and calling for May to take a firmer stand against Trump: Trump\u2019s Muslim Ban: Time for our Government to Stand Up For British Values 29 January 2017 The Muslim Council of Britain condemns the executive order by US President Trump to initiate a ban on people from a select few Muslim majority countries. It calls on our British government to speak out much more forcefully and stand up for the British values it supposedly seeks from others. For all intents and purposes this is a Muslim ban designed not to confront terrorism but to placate the most hateful sections of American society. Those countries whose citizens were found to be involved in terrorism in the United States are not on Mr Trump\u2019s list. Harun Khan, secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain, said: \u201cThis ban on Muslims is not only an inconvenience, it is downright dangerous to our values of equality and non-discrimination. We are told that British values include the rule of law and mutual respect for and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs and for those without faith. \u201cAnd yet, our prime minister has found it hard to express these values when representing us on the world stage. At the same time, the ban will affect us here in Britain, as those with dual nationality such as Sir Mo Farah and the Conservative MP Nadhim Zahawi will also be affected by this ban. \u201cOur government should express in no uncertain terms how daft this policy is to its US counterparts, and press home how counter-productive it is in its professed fight to confront terrorism. \u201cIn front of Mr Trump, the prime minister said that the point of the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d was to have a frank dialogue. Well, this is one area where we need to be frank about where we stand. As an important ally of the United States, surely we have a duty to remind them of the values on which they were founded upon.\u201d Since you\u2019re here, we have a small favour to ask. More people are reading the Guardian than ever \u2013 but far fewer are paying for it, and advertising revenues are falling fast. So you can see why we need to ask for your help. The Guardian\u2019s journalism takes a lot of time, money and hard work to produce. But we do it because we believe that independent reporting and plurality of voices matter. If everyone who reads our reporting helps to pay for it, our future would be much more secure. Support us with a monthly payment or a one-off contribution. - Guardian HQ The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, has added his voice to the growing calls for Trump\u2019s visit to UK in the summer to be cancelled. He reiterated his condemnation of the US travel ban on seven Muslim-majority countries and said the UK should not be rolling out the \u201cred carpet\u201d while it remains in place. He also suggested he would boycott the event if it did go ahead. Trump is awake and tweeting a defence of his controversial travel ban. PA has issued a fuller statement from Sir Mo Farah in which he says Trump\u2019s ban made him \u201can alien\u201d. The Somalia-born four-time Olympic champion, who lives and trains in the US, said: On 1 January this year, Her Majesty the Queen made me a knight of the realm. On 27 January, President Donald Trump seems to have made me an alien. I am a British citizen who has lived in America for the past six years \u2013 working hard, contributing to society, paying my taxes and bringing up our four children in the place they now call home. Now, me and many others like me are being told that we may not be welcome. It\u2019s deeply troubling that I will have to tell my children that daddy might not be able to come home \u2013 to explain why the president has introduced a policy that comes from a place of ignorance and prejudice. I was welcomed into Britain from Somalia at eight years old and given the chance to succeed and realise my dreams. I have been proud to represent my country, win medals for the British people and receive the greatest honour of a knighthood. My story is an example of what can happen when you follow polices of compassion and understanding, not hate and isolation. No 10 has insisted that Trump\u2019s state visit in the summer will go ahead despite growing calls for it to be cancelled in light of his travel ban for people from several Muslim-majority countries. Jeremy Corbyn and Tim Farron have called for it to be cancelled and a petition supporting the move, which had a few hundred signatures this morning, has now topped 100,000. Sir Mo Farah, one of the UK\u2019s most successful athletes, has just issued a statement condemning Trump\u2019s travel ban. I am a British citizen who has lived in America for the past six years \u2013 working hard, contributing to society, paying my taxes and bringing up our four children in the place they now call home. Now, me and many others like me are being told that we may not be welcome. It\u2019s deeply troubling that I will have to tell my children that daddy might not be able to come home \u2013 to explain why the president has introduced a policy that comes from a place of ignorance and prejudice. My colleague Nicola Slawson reported on Saturday about the plight of an Iranian-born Glasgow vet after she was left stranded in Costa Rica following Trump\u2019s executive order. Since then members of the public have raised thousands of pounds to help her. Here is Nicola\u2019s updated story: Thousands of pounds has been raised for an Iranian-born Glasgow vet after she was left stranded in Costa Rica following Trump\u2019s executive order. Hamaseh Tayari\u2019s flight home from her holiday required her to change flights in New York, meaning she would need a transit visa, which was revoked in light of the travel ban because of her Iranian passport. Tayari, who grew up in Italy, told the Guardian: \u201cI am destroyed. I did not know that I could cry for so long. It feels like the beginning of the end. How this is possible?\u201d A group of Scottish women lead by Kathleen Caskie, from the the Women for Independence campaign group, banded together to set up a Go Fund Me page to raise enough money for her new flight home. Caskie said: \u201cFirstly, she works in Glasgow, so therefore is now Glaswegian, and you don\u2019t cross Glaswegians, and secondly, we hate Trump and, finally, our reach is such that we could raise the money by midnight tonight if she needs it.\u201d In the end, the cost of the flights, \u00a32,600, was raised in less than 33 minutes. Nearly \u00a35,000 has now been raised and all extra money will be donated to the Scottish Council for Refugees \u201cin further protest against Trump\u2019s policies\u201d. On hearing the news, Tayari, who said the cost of the new flight was more than her whole month\u2019s wages, said: \u201cMy God! This is amazing. I was not expecting this.\u201d Is this a hardening of the UK line from Boris Johnson? It certainly seems to go further than either May and David Gauke this morning, calling Trump\u2019s travel ban \u201cdivisive and wrong\u201d. This is from Philip Oltermann, the Guardian\u2019s Berlin bureau chief, with a few more details of a phone call between Angela Merkel and Donald Trump on Saturday. A spokesperson for Angela Merkel said on Sunday that she \u201cregrets\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s decision to ban citizens of certain countries from entering the country, and that the German chancellor had \u201cexplained\u201d the obligations of the Geneva refugee convention to the US president in a phone call on Saturday. \u201cThe chancellor regrets the US government\u2019s entry ban against refugees and the citizens of certain countries\u201d, Merkel\u2019s spokesperson Steffen Seibert said in a statement. \u201cShe is convinced that the necessary, decisive battle against terrorism does not justify a general suspicion against people of a certain origin or a certain religion\u201d. \u201cThe Geneva refugee convention requires the international community to take in war refugees on humanitarian grounds. All signatory states are obligated to do. The German government explained this policy in their call yesterday.\u201d Seibert further said that the German government would examine what consequences the ban would have for German citizens with dual citizenship, and would \u201crepresent their interests, if necessary, before our American partners\u201d. A summary of the phone call between Merkel and Trump, jointly issued to the press on Saturday, had made no mention of the travel ban, emphasising merely the \u201cfundamental significance\u201d of Nato and the intention to \u201cfurther deepen the already excellent bilateral relations in the coming years\u201d. One of the German citizens apparently already affected has a seat in the German parliament. Omid Nouripour, a Green Party MP with German-Iranian citizenship, is reported to be among tens of thousands of German citizens believed to be banned from entering the US under the travel ban. Nouripour is the vice-chair of the German parliament\u2019s American-German group and a member of the steering committee of Germany\u2019s Atlantic Bridge programme. Google co-founder Sergey Brin joined the protests at US airports on Saturday. He said he was there because \u201cI\u2019m a refugee.\u201d It seems that many within the Republican party are unhappy with Trump\u2019s latest move, too. My colleague Richard Adams has flagged up this piece from The Hill, which reports several senior senators have come out against the move. GOP lawmakers are stepping out against President Trump\u2019s executive order barring many refugees and citizens of certain predominantly Muslim countries from entering the U.S. Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) called the order \u201cunacceptable\u201d amid concerns that it would prevent legal permanent residents from entering the U.S., which the administration attempted to clarify on Saturday. \u201cPresident Trump and his administration are right to be concerned about national security, but it\u2019s unacceptable when even legal permanent residents are being detained or turned away at airports and ports of entry,\u201d Flake said in a statement. \u201cEnhancing long term national security requires that we have a clear-eyed view of radical Islamic terrorism without ascribing radical Islamic terrorist views to all Muslims,\u201d Flake added. The Guardian\u2019s political editor Anushka Asthana has had this from the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn. He says that May would be \u201cfailing British people\u201d if she allowed Trump to come for a state visit while his policy \u2013 including an indefinite ban on Syrian refugees \u2013 remains in place. \u201cDonald Trump should not be welcomed to Britain while he abuses our shared values with his shameful Muslim ban and attacks on refugees\u2019 and women\u2019s rights,\u201d said Corbyn. \u201cTheresa May would be failing the British people if she does not postpone the state visit and condemn Trump\u2019s actions in the clearest terms. That\u2019s what Britain expects and deserves.\u201d A bit more on the story that the US Department of Homeland Security is going to implement the ban despite a court order from a federal judge overnight that granted a stay on deportations for people who arrived in the US with valid visas but were detained on entry. This is the original statement from homeland security, which says it \u201cwill continue to enforce all of President Trump\u2019s executive orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s executive orders remain in place \u2013 prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the US government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety.\u201d However, the final paragraph adds: \u201cThe Department of Homeland Security will comply with judicial orders; faithfully enforce our immigration laws, and implement President Trump\u2019s executive orders to ensure that those entering the United States do not pose a threat to our country or the American people.\u201d Here is the statement in full: Department Of Homeland Security Response To Recent Litigation Release Date: January 29, 2017 For Immediate Release Office of the Press Secretary Contact: 202-282-8010 WASHINGTON \u2013 The Department of Homeland Security will continue to enforce all of President Trump\u2019s Executive Orders in a manner that ensures the safety and security of the American people. President Trump\u2019s Executive Orders remain in place\u2014prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety. President Trump\u2019s Executive Order affects a minor portion of international travelers, and is a first step towards reestablishing control over America\u2019s borders and national security. Approximately 80 million international travelers enter the United States every year. Yesterday, less than one percent of the more than 325,000 international air travelers who arrive every day were inconvenienced while enhanced security measures were implemented. These individuals went through enhanced security screenings and are being processed for entry to the United States, consistent with our immigration laws and judicial orders. The Department of Homeland Security will faithfully execute the immigration laws, and we will treat all of those we encounter humanely and with professionalism. No foreign national in a foreign land, without ties to the United States, has any unfettered right to demand entry into the United States or to demand immigration benefits in the United States. The Department of Homeland Security will comply with judicial orders; faithfully enforce our immigration laws, and implement President Trump\u2019s Executive Orders to ensure that those entering the United States do not pose a threat to our country or the American people. My colleague Alice Ross is exploring what this will mean for those trying to enter the US from the affected countries. The former Ukip leader Nigel Farage is now being interviewed on the BBC. He says he backs Trump\u2019s travel ban and calls for the UK to do something similar. \u201cIn this country I would like to see extreme vetting ... This is what Trump\u2019s supporters want him to do.\u201d And for good measure he is backing Trump\u2019s planned wall with Mexico. The Independent is reporting that US homeland security has vowed to implement the ban in the face of the court order. Well Farron obviously decided not to \u201chedge his bets\u201d for long. The Lib Dems have just put out a statement on behalf of their leader in which he is very clear that Trump\u2019s planned visit should not go ahead. Tim Farron, leader of the Liberal Democrats, has said that Britain should put President Trump\u2019s visit on hold until he stops banning people purely on grounds of their faith. Tim Farron said: \u201cDowning Street has finally distanced itself from President Trump\u2019s appalling ban on Muslim people after Theresa May failed to do so. By then the damage to Britain\u2019s reputation had been done. \u201cThe British people were waiting for a Love Actually moment, instead they saw our prime minister behaving like Trump\u2019s poodle. \u201cAny visit by President Trump to Britain should be on hold until his disgraceful ban comes to an end. Otherwise Theresa May would be placing the Queen in an impossible position of welcoming a man who is banning British citizens purely on grounds of their faith. \u201cStill Boris Johnson\u2019s Foreign Office is dithering and has provided no travel advice to British citizens who could be caught up in the ban. \u201cWhen will Theresa May\u2019s Conservative Brexit government stop costing [sic] up to unsavoury leaders and get a grip of this mounting crisis?\u201d The petition to stop Trump\u2019s state visit to the UK planned for later this year was on a few hundred when I first spotted it this morning. Now it is nearing 16,000 and going strong. It will be interesting to see if other politicians join Corbyn in supporting the move. The Lib Dem leader, Tim Farron, appeared to duck the question on Marr this morning: I thought the offer of a state visit was hasty, particularly given the things he\u2019s been coming out with recently. My view is, of course you should engage with people like that. But there\u2019s a massive difference between engaging with Donald Trump and effectively giving succour to the kind of things that he\u2019s coming out with. Here is the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Berlin correspondent on Angela Merkel\u2019s stance. A bit more detail on Angela Merkel\u2019s stance on the US travel ban. According to the AFP new agency her spokesman Steffen Seibert said: \u201cThe chancellor regrets the entry ban imposed by the US government against refugees and nationals from certain countries. \u201cShe is convinced that even in the necessarily resolute battle against terrorism it is not justified to place people from a certain origin or belief under general suspicion.\u201d The German government \u201cwill now examine the consequences\u201d of the ban for German citizens with dual nationality affected by the decision, he added. There appears to be a growing momentum behind calls to stop Trump coming to the UK for a full state visit in the summer. A formal petition has been launched here and former Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown has voiced his concerns on Twitter. Former Labour leadership candidate Chuka Umunna has just added his voice, saying Trump should not be allowed to come until the travel ban is overturned. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, has issued a strong rebuttal of the US travel ban. Robert Peston is now interviewing the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, on ITV. Corbyn reiterates his \u201ctotal opposition\u201d to the travel ban which he says represents a fundamental attack on key tenets of the Geneva convention. And he says Trump\u2019s planned visit to the UK later this year should be put on hold until the ban is lifted. More from the Iraqi-born Tory MP Nadhim Zahawi. According to Sky News he fears his sons who study in the US will not be able to re-enter the country. The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, has issued a damning statement on Trump\u2019s travel ban, saying it \u201cflies in the face of US values of freedom and tolerance\u201d. President Trump\u2019s ban on refugees and immigrants from certain countries is shameful and cruel. The USA has a proud history of welcoming and resettling refugees. The President can\u2019t just turn his back on this global crisis - all countries need to play their part. While every country has the right to set its own immigration policies, this new policy flies in the face of the values of freedom and tolerance that the USA was built upon. I\u2019m pleased that the Prime Minister has now said she and the government do not agree with President Trump\u2019s policy, which will affect many British citizens who have dual nationality, including Londoners born in countries affected by the ban. I will work with the government on behalf of Londoners affected. As a nation that, like the USA, values tolerance, diversity and freedom, we cannot just shrug our shoulders and say: \u2018It\u2019s not our problem\u2019. The UK government has sent out David Gauke, chief secretary to the treasury, to defend its position. He insists May was right not to condemn the travel ban earlier, adding the government will now make representations to the US on behalf of Britons caught up in the ban. Gauke says the UK has a relationship with the Trump administration thanks to May\u2019s trip which will give the UK more influence. Next up on Marr was Harriet Harman. My colleague Rowena Mason has just sent this through: Harriet Harman, former acting Labour leader, said it was important as British prime minister that May went to the US to meet the new president. However, she added: \u201cI was apprehensive as we know Donald Trump is misogynist and xenophobic and stands against so many British values, so I was very dismayed when I saw her holding his hand ... And then I was horrified when he announced this ban and three times she said it was nothing to do with me. Well, it is to do with us. She obviously needs to be careful as PM, but she needs to be strong as well. \u201cI was really disappointed and hope she has learned some lessons. She has got to learn that she has got to stand up for things and can\u2019t just be cautious and just come out against something when she is pushed, because we are in a vulnerable position economically, looking for trade deals, it must not make her feel weak, she has got to be politically strong.\u201d The Iraq born Tory MP Nadhim Zahawi has voiced his anger and opposition to the travel ban on the BBC\u2019s The Andrew Marr show this morning, saying he would no longer be able to travel to the US. He said that for the first time in his life he felt discriminated against, adding \u201cit\u2019s demeaning, it\u2019s sad.\u201d He said the ban would hit hundreds of thousands of Britons who were born in the countries included in the ban and warned it would boost Islamic extremists: \u201cIt plays into their ideology. It is counterproductive\u201d and ruined the US\u2019s reputation as a haven for refugees and those fleeing persecution On Saturday night he retweeted this in an apparent dig at Theresa May\u2019s initial reluctance to condemn the ban. On Marr, Zahawi said he welcomed May\u2019s subsequent announcement that she did not agree with Trump, adding he hoped the US would see sense and overturn the decision. Moustafa Bayoumi, associate professor of English at Brooklyn College, City University of New York, has given a damning verdict on Trump\u2019s travel ban. He says it \u201cis nothing short of a Muslim ban by another name. It is cruel and callous, espouses positions contrary to the professed values of the United States, and will certainly produce more problems than it purports to solve. In other words, it\u2019s exactly like Donald Trump.\u201d Read the full piece here. The travel ban has provoked huge protests some airports across the US. The biggest appears to have been at JFK airport in New York, where thousands of people gathered to voice their opposition, chanting \u201cRefugees are welcome here. No hate no fear \u2013 immigrants are welcome here\u201d. The Guardian has a picture gallery of the demonstrations here. Among those to condemn Trump\u2019s move was the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau. In a series of tweets, Trudeau underscored his government\u2019s commitment to bringing in \u201cthose fleeing persecution, terror &amp; war\u201d. Within hours Trudeau\u2019s tweets had been shared more than 300,000 times. In the US, there was horror among groups that work with refugees and migrants. Thanu Yakupitiyage, a spokeswoman for the New York Immigration Coalition, told the Observer: \u201cThis is dehumanising. I am livid. It\u2019s outrageous. People are in a state of shock.\u201d Immigration policy analyst David Bier, from the Cato Institute\u2019s Center for Global Liberty and Prosperity, described Trump\u2019s order as \u201cillegal\u201d as it appeared to target a religious group. The Council on American-Islamic Relations said it would issue a court challenge on Monday, claiming that the new entry rules target Muslims because of their faith and therefore contravene the constitutional right to freedom of religion. In the UK, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, condemned the ban and Theresa May\u2019s reaction to it. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s executive order against refugees and Muslims should shock and appal us all.\u201d He said May should have stood up for \u201cBritain and our values by condemning his actions. It should sadden our country that she chose not to. \u201cAfter Trump\u2019s hideous actions and May\u2019s weak failure to condemn them, it\u2019s more important than ever for us to say to refugees seeking a place of safety that they will always be welcome in Britain.\u201d Sarah Wollaston, chair of the Commons health select committee, said Trump must not be invited to address both houses of parliament from Westminster Hall on his state visit later this year, pointedly insisting that \u201cthose who wish to fawn over him\u201d should do so elsewhere. The Scottish Tory leade,r Ruth Davidson, said the ban was \u201cboth wrong in itself and very worrying for the future\u201d. Good morning. Welcome to the Guardian liveblog following the developments and reaction to Donald\u2019s Trump\u2019s US travel ban for people from several Muslim-majority counties. Here is a quick summary of what we know so far: Donald Trump\u2019s decision to ban immigration from a string of Muslim-majority nations has sparked fury and anguish around the world as refugees and migrants were prevented from boarding flights to the US. The executive order, which halts travel from seven Muslim-majority countries \u2013 Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen \u2013 has received global condemnation and led to chaos at US airports. A homeland security spokesman said that green card holders \u2013 in effect, permanent residents \u2013 will also be covered by the ban, while a senior White House official indicated it was likely to be extended to other countries. A state department spokesman confirmed that travellers from the named countries who have dual nationality will not be able to enter the US for 90 days. Members of religious minorities from those countries will, however, be granted immigration priority. In the US a federal judge granted a stay on deportations for people who arrived in the US with valid visas but were detained on entry. The stay is only a partial block to the broader executive order, with the judge stopping short of a broader ruling on its constitutionality. Nevertheless, it was an early, significant blow to the new administration. In the UK, the prime minister, Theresa May, was forced to issue a late-night statement saying she \u201cdoes not agree\u201d with Trump\u2019s ban after coming under intense political pressure to condemn the order. The statement is unlikely to be strong enough to satisfy many of the MPs expressing outrage about Trump\u2019s move is also facing questions about why she took so long to respond to the controversy, which has soured her trip to visit Trump on Friday, which Downing Street had regarded as a success.",

          "bodyText": "Six people have been killed and another 18 wounded after a gunmen opened fire at a mosque in Qu\u00e9bec City, in an act condemned as a \u201cterrorist attack\u201d by Canada\u2019s prime minister. More than 50 people were at the Qu\u00e9bec City Islamic cultural center, also known as the Grande Mosqu\u00e9e de Qu\u00e9bec, for evening prayers on Sunday when shooting erupted in the two-storey building. Two men have been arrested, but police later said that only one of them was considered a suspect. Initial reports suggested a third suspect was still on the run, but police said they were no longer looking for anyone else in connection with the shooting. In a news conference on Monday morning, Qu\u00e9bec province and city officials declined to provide any details about the two men who were arrested. Qu\u00e9bec City police inspector Denis Turcotte said that one of the menhad been arrested on the scene of the attack. The second was captured about an hour later after calling into 911 and identifying himself as involved, sharing his location with authorities and letting them know he was armed. \u201cNothing indicates to us that there was anyone else involved,\u201d said Martin Plante, a superintendent with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Plante added that the suspects were previously \u201cunknown\u201d to police. Those who died ranged in age from 35 to 60. Another five people remain in hospital \u2013 several of them in intensive care \u2013 while 13 people have been released, according to a hospital spokesperson. Speaking in parliament, prime minister Justin Trudeau said that the victims were targeted simply because of their religion and spoke directly to the more than 1 million Muslims who live in Canada, saying, \u201cWe are with you.\u201d \u201cThirty-six million hearts are breaking with yours,\u201d Trudeau said. \u201cKnow that we value you.\u201d Witnesses reported seeing the gunman dressed in black and wearing a ski mask walking into the mosque and opening fire. One watched as he began shooting at \u201ceverything that was moving\u201d, he told the Globe and Mail. \u201cIt was someone who mastered weapons because it was calm \u2026 He killed and he killed. It was really horrible.\u201d The witness, who was lying on the ground near the front of the mosque, said the gunman had emptied his weapon before leaving. \u201cI\u2019m shocked,\u201d he said. \u201cWe thought that here, we were in a safe city, a safe country. But unfortunately, that\u2019s not the case.\u201d Trudeau described the shooting as an act of terrorism. \u201cWe condemn this terrorist attack on Muslims in a centre of worship and refuge,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cWhile authorities are still investigating and details continue to be confirmed, it is heart-wrenching to see such senseless violence. Diversity is our strength, and religious tolerance is a value that we, as Canadians, hold dear.\u201d Phillippe Couillard, the premier of Qu\u00e9bec, described Sunday\u2019s shooting as a \u201cmurderous act directed at a specific community\u201d and said solidarity rallies would be held across Qu\u00e9bec on Monday. \u201cQu\u00e9bec categorically rejects this barbaric violence.\u201d The shooting came amid protests and confusion around the world after Donald Trump enacted a travel ban on seven Muslim-majority countries. Asked if Trump\u2019s actions influenced the attack, Couillard said no, but added: \u201cWe are obviously in a world where people tend to divide themselves rather than unite themselves\u201d. Trump called Trudeau on Monday to express his condolences and offer assistance. The mosque\u2019s president, Mohamed Yangui \u2013 who was not inside the mosque when the shooting occurred \u2013 said he had received frantic calls from people at evening prayers. \u201cWhy is this happening here? This is barbaric,\u201d he said. By Sunday night, city police said the site had been secured and all occupants evacuated. A large security cordon was set up around the site. Witnesses reported seeing heavily armed police entering the mosque after the shooting. Fighting back tears at an early morning press conference, the city\u2019s mayor, R\u00e9gis Labeaume, said Qu\u00e9bec was in mourning. \u201cI want to express my revolt to this villainous crime,\u201d he added. \u201cTo the Muslim community, our neighbours, our co-citizens, who count on our support and solidarity, I want to say: we love you.\u201d The mosque has been targeted before. In June, a pig\u2019s head was left there during the holy month of Ramadan. Weeks later, an Islamophobic letter was distributed in the vicinity. Yangui told the Edmonton Journal the mosque had not received any threats recently. \u201cWe have a very good relationship with the neighbours, with the community,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s mutual respect \u2013 and now today we have this dramatic event.\u201d Across Canada and Qu\u00e9bec, most are welcoming towards immigrants and religious diversity. But recent years have also seen Qu\u00e9bec host a long-simmering debate over race and religious accommodation; in October, the province began parliamentary hearings on proposed legislation that would ban anyone wearing a face covering from receiving public services in the province. Police said on Monday that security had been increased at all mosques across the province. Many across Canada were still reeling from the heightened tensions in the US after Donald Trump\u2019s travel ban. Trudeau responded to the ban with a tweet: \u201cTo those fleeing persecution, terror &amp; war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada.\u201d The tweet was followed by a picture of him greeting a Syrian child at the Toronto airport in 2015, one of nearly 40,000 Syrian refugees who have arrived in Canada in the past year.",

          "bodyText": "Malcolm Turnbull has refused to comment on Donald Trump\u2019s contentious ban on travel by people from a group of Muslim-majority nations, labelling it the \u201cdomestic policy\u201d of another country. But the prime minister did reiterate Australia\u2019s commitment to multiculturalism and a nondiscriminatory immigration program. While there have been chaotic scenes at US airports since the ban took effect, at a media conference in Canberra on Monday, Turnbull downplayed the impact of Trump\u2019s executive order, saying the Australian government had not yet had any reports of dual citizens being denied entry to the US. But the foreign minister, Julie Bishop revealed later on Monday the Australian government was seeking an exemption from the travel ban for dual citizens. The US has given both the United Kingdom and Canada an exemption from the controversial ban. Turnbull told reporters he and Trump had spoken on Sunday, and he confirmed reports that Australia had secured Trump\u2019s agreement to honour the deal to resettle refugees held on Manus Island and Nauru, which was negotiated under the Obama administration. \u201cWe discussed the importance of border security,\u201d Turnbull said. \u201cThe threat of illegal and irregular migration, and recognised that it is vital that every nation is able to control who comes across its borders.\u201d Asked about the travel ban \u2013 which has sparked protests, a legal challenge and criticism in the US and internationally \u2013 Turnbull dead batted, saying: \u201cIt is not my job, as prime minister of Australia, to run a commentary on the domestic policies of other countries.\u201d While the major parties normally prioritise bipartisanship on foreign affairs matters, the Labor leader Bill Shorten branded Trump\u2019s travel ban \u201cappalling\u201d and he declared Turnbull needed to show leadership. Labor\u2019s foreign affairs spokeswoman, Penny Wong, meanwhile wrote to the government to ask if the travel ban applies to Australian dual citizens, and sought \u201cclarification\u201d on the government\u2019s position on the ban itself. She noted that the terms of the order implied dual citizens would be affected but Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, had said Canadian dual nationals will be exempt. \u201cI seek your advice on what representations the government has made to the US administration on behalf of these Australians, and confirmation on whether the executive order applies to Australian dual nationals,\u201d Wong wrote. In a response to Wong and Guardian Australia, Bishop said: \u201cI have directed our officials in Washington DC to work with US officials to ensure any preferential treatment extended to any other country in relation to travel and entry to the United States is extended to Australia.\u201d Earlier, during his press conference in Canberra, when asked to comment on the executive order, given that it may affect Australian dual nationals, Turnbull said: \u201cWe have not seen any cases of it so doing.\u201d \u201cAs the foreign minister\u2019s spokesman said this morning, our embassy is engaging with US officials on this subject. \u201cBut at this stage, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has not had any consular assistance requests from Australians unable to board. \u201cIf those issues arise in respect of Australian citizens, we will, and we are, taking up that issue with the administration.\u201d Asked whether the US policy was discriminatory, Turnbull said: \u201cOur values are very well-known \u2013 our commitment to multiculturalism, our commitment to a nondiscriminatory immigration program is very well-known. \u201cThat\u2019s where we stand.

On Sunday Australia\u2019s trade minister, Steve Ciobo, said he would not support a Trump-style ban and nor would most Australians. In an interview with Sky News on Monday, the education minister, Simon Birmingham, repeated Turnbull\u2019s formulation that the executive order was a US policy but Australia had a nondiscriminatory immigration program of which its people \u201cshould be proud\u201d. Morrison did not address the principle of nondiscrimination in his interview on 2GB Radio on Monday. Birmingham rebuked his Coalition colleague George Christensen, who told Guardian Australia on Sunday that he would like to see a total ban on Australia\u2019s humanitarian intake and a Trump-style ban from countries that had a high level of violent extremism. Christensen repeated those arguments on Sky News on Monday, but NSW Liberal backbencher Trent Zimmerman \u2013 an influential moderate \u2013 was critical of the Trump travel ban. Zimmerman said the world looked to the US to be a beacon of tolerance and diversity. \u201cWhat I\u2019d say as an individual is that I share a lot of the concerns that have been raised in the United States over the past week,\u201d Zimmerman said. He said the \u201cchaotic\u201d implementation of the executive order had caused unnecessary grief. \u201cWe need America to be a beacon for democracy, for tolerance, and the type of values that we want all other countries to uphold.\u201d \u201cI think the US government has to look at its own actions through that prism, and the type of message it is sending around the world.\u201d Turnbull refused to give further details of the refugee deal, of which much is still unknown, including how many people will be resettled. He said the US screening process \u2013 which is already under way, with US officials visiting Manus Island and Nauru \u2013 would be \u201cvery thorough\u201d and would take \u201csome time\u201d. The immigration minister, Peter Dutton, said the US had the ultimate say in who it accepted under the resettlement deal, subject to its own screening. He said the Australian government was aware that \u201cpeople smugglers are trying to pitch to people to pay money to hop on to boats so that they can eventually end up in the US\u201d.",

The <a href=\"https://www.cair.com/\">Council on American-Islamic Relations </a>said it would issue a court challenge on Monday, claiming that the new entry rules target Muslims because of their faith and therefore contravene the constitutional right to freedom of religion.</p> <p>Former British foreign secretary David Miliband, now president of the <a href=\"https://www.rescue.org/\">International Rescue Committee</a>, said the suspension of the refugee resettlement programme was a \u201charmful and hasty\u201d decision. \u201cAmerica must remain true to its core values. It must remain a beacon of hope,\u201d he said. He added that the vetting process was already robust, involving biometric screening and up to 36 months of investigations by 15 agencies.</p> <p>New York\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.refugeesinternational.org\"> International Refugee Assistance Project </a>(IRAP) said the extreme vetting order meant the US would no longer be able to lead by example in matters of global humanitarian concern.</p> <p>Syrian refugees in Jordan lamented the policy change. Ammar Sawan, 40, who began his first step toward US resettlement three months ago, said: \u201cIt was like a bolt of lightning. All our hopes and dreams vanished.\u201d In Britain, Ibrahim Mogra, chair of the<a href=\"http://christianmuslimforum.org/\"> Christian Muslim Forum</a>, said Trump\u2019s action suggested he viewed Muslims as \u201csubhuman\u201d.</p> <p>Yvette Cooper MP wrote to May saying she hoped the prime minister was \u201caware of the dangerous implications and the humanitarian consequences of the US \u2013 a country built on giving sanctuary \u2013 taking this decision now\u201d.</p>",

Thanu Yakupitiyage, a spokeswoman for the New York Immigration Coalition, told the Observer: \u201cThis is dehumanising. I am livid. It\u2019s outrageous. People are in a state of shock.\u201d Immigration policy analyst David Bier, from the Cato Institute\u2019s Center for Global Liberty and Prosperity, described Trump\u2019s order as \u201cillegal\u201d as it appeared to target a religious group. The Council on American-Islamic Relations said it would issue a court challenge on Monday, claiming that the new entry rules target Muslims because of their faith and therefore contravene the constitutional right to freedom of religion. Former British foreign secretary David Miliband, now president of the International Rescue Committee, said the suspension of the refugee resettlement programme was a \u201charmful and hasty\u201d decision. \u201cAmerica must remain true to its core values. It must remain a beacon of hope,\u201d he said. He added that the vetting process was already robust, involving biometric screening and up to 36 months of investigations by 15 agencies. New York\u2019s International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP) said the extreme vetting order meant the US would no longer be able to lead by example in matters of global humanitarian concern. Syrian refugees in Jordan lamented the policy change. Ammar Sawan, 40, who began his first step toward US resettlement three months ago, said: \u201cIt was like a bolt of lightning. All our hopes and dreams vanished.\u201d In Britain, Ibrahim Mogra, chair of the Christian Muslim Forum, said Trump\u2019s action suggested he viewed Muslims as \u201csubhuman\u201d. Yvette Cooper MP wrote to May saying she hoped the prime minister was \u201caware of the dangerous implications and the humanitarian consequences of the US \u2013 a country built on giving sanctuary \u2013 taking this decision now\u201d.",

MacDonald pointed to a 2013 survey of government scientists in which 24% said they had been directly asked to exclude or alter information for non-scientific reasons. \u201cThat\u2019s something you would expect to hear in the 1950s from eastern Europe, not something you expect to hear from a democracy like Canada in 2013,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think, by all indication, that\u2019s what our sisters and brothers are going to be faced with down in the United States.\u201d Recent days have seen the Trump administration reportedly consider scrubbing all mentions of climate change from the Environmental Protection Agency website, while the Associated Press reported that EPA scientists could be subject to a \u201ctemporary hold\u201d, pending review by political appointees. The reports have sparked concern north of the border. \u201cWe\u2019re already reaching out to our counterparts in the US and in the international science community,\u201d said Debi Daviau, head of the Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada, a union that represents more than 15,000 government scientists, engineers and researchers. On Thursday, her organisation released a statement calling the actions of the Trump administration a \u201cchilling reminder\u201d of the years under Stephen Harper\u2019s leadership. \u201cWe therefore stand in solidarity with our colleagues and fellow government scientists in the United States \u2026 by once again declaring science should never be silenced, and by expressing our hope that the current restrictions on US government scientists will soon be lifted and do not signal a lasting change in US policy on science, similar to the one we fought so long to overturn in Canada.\u201d In 2013, hundreds of people clad in white lab coats gathered on Parliament Hill in Ottawa for what became one of the most visible acts of resistance against the repression of Canadian government scientists. A mock funeral procession was held over the \u201cdeath of scientific evidence\u201d, complete with eulogies that took aim at the years of escalating hostility from the Conservative government. Similar protests were held across the country. Evidence for Democracy, the group behind the Canadian protests, has been in touch with the organisers of the March for Science in the US. The Americans pointed to the Canadian experience to explain why resistance has galvanised so quickly in the US, said Katie Gibbs of Evidence for Democracy. \u201cThey saw what happened under Harper and so they\u2019ve seen where it leads and so they\u2019re not taking a wait-and-see approach, they\u2019re acting now.\u201d Gibbs described the reports this week about the actions of Trump\u2019s team torwards climate science as shocking. \u201cIt absolutely echoes what we saw under George Bush in the States and what we saw under Harper, except it\u2019s so much swifter and more brazen than what we saw under Harper,\u201d she said. \u201cBut at the same time there\u2019s been a huge resistance coming out of the scientific community and that\u2019s been really heartening to see.\u201d The Canadian experience offers myriad lessons for the US government scientists, said Kristi Miller-Saunders \u2013 who was one of Canada\u2019s first government scientists to be banned from speaking to the media over a paper exploring the 2009 collapse of the sockeye salmon population in British Columbia. Chief among these lessons is the link between the treatment of scientists and the credibility of the science they create, said the molecular geneticist. \u201cIf the government can suppress information coming out of a programme \u2026 that information is not in the public eye anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd when the information is not in the public eye, the public thinks they\u2019re really not doing much in that area, there really hasn\u2019t been any inroads made. And it\u2019s much easier for the government to then quietly cut the program.\u201d Science is made within a community, said MacDonald \u2013 and that community now stands ready to fight for US government scientists. \u201cOne of the wonderful things that happened for us during our darkest days with the Harper government was the support we had received from international scientists and from our brothers and sisters down in the States,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we\u2019re there to stand with them shoulder to shoulder. We\u2019ll be there for them.\u201d",

Both initiatives are part of an environmental policy, he said, that allows Canada to \u201cget our resources to market safely and responsibly while meeting our climate change goals.\u201d</p> <p>Trump also signed the executive order for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/dakota-access-pipeline\">Dakota Access pipeline</a>, a $3.7bn project that would transport crude oil from North Dakota through South Dakota and Iowa to a shipping point in Illinois, \u201cagain, subject to terms and conditions to be negotiated by us\u201d.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/24/standing-rock-resistance-donald-trump-executive-order\">Standing Rock Sioux tribe</a>, whose reservation is adjacent to the pipeline, staged protests that drew thousands of climate change activists to the rural area of Cannon Ball, North Dakota. Most of the pipeline was complete by last summer except for a small section under Lake Oahe, a reservoir that forms part of the river.</p> <p>The Sioux won a significant victory late last year when the US army corps of engineers declined to allow construction of the pipeline under the lake, saying alternative routes needed to be considered.</p> <p>On Tuesday, the Sioux said the pipeline risked contaminating tribal and American water supplies while disregarding treaty rights. \u201cPresident Trump is legally required to honor our treaty rights and provide a fair and reasonable pipeline process,\u201d said Dave Archambault II, chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe.</p> <p>\u201cAmericans know this pipeline was unfairly rerouted towards our nation and without our consent. The existing pipeline route risks infringing on our treaty rights, contaminating our water and the water of 17 million Americans downstream.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/24/keystone-xl-dakota-access-pipeline-explainer\">How Keystone XL and Dakota Access went from opposition to resurrection</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Energy Transfer Partners, the company that wants to build the pipeline, disputes the claim that it threatens the water supply and insists the pipeline will be safe.</p> <p>Obama cancelled the Keystone project in late 2015 after environmentalists campaigned against the project for more than seven years. \u201cAmerica is now a global leader when it comes to taking serious action to fight climate change, and frankly, approving this project would have undercut that leadership,\u201d he said at the time.</p> <p>The house speaker, Paul Ryan, endorsed Trump\u2019s decision to advance the pipeline projects. \u201cIt\u2019s about time,\u201d he said. \u201cThe unfortunate reality is that these important infrastructure projects were used by special interests to advance their radical anti-energy agenda and were therefore needlessly halted by the last administration \u2013 to the detriment of America\u2019s national interest. These pipelines will strengthen our nation\u2019s energy supply and help keep energy costs low for American families.\u201d</p> <p>Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell agreed, saying the Keystone pipeline was \u201cabout much-needed jobs and energy independence for our nation. Unfortunately, President Obama sat on this important project throughout his entire administration, even though his own state department said it had no measurable impact on climate. It is refreshing to have an administration putting jobs and the economy ahead of extreme political views.\u201d</p> <p>But environmentalists expressed disappointment and vowed to fight on. Erich Pica, president of Friends of the Earth, said: \u201cDonald Trump has made it clear that his America does not include the millions of Americans who fought to protect our land, water, sacred cultural sites and climate from dangerous pipelines. Trump has emphatically pledged his allegiance to the oil companies and Wall Street banks that stand to profit from the destruction of public health and the environment.\u201d</p> <p>Rhea Suh, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said: \u201cIt\u2019s appalling that Trump wants to throw open our borders to big polluters. Eliminating the national interest determination process, used by both Republican and Democratic administrations for decades, cedes control of our borders to multinational corporations to jam through cross-border infrastructure projects. And it completely shuts out public engagement in decisions that affect our communities, air, water and climate.\u201d</p> <p>Democrats joined the criticism. Bernie Sanders, senator for Vermont, said: \u201cMillions of people came together all over this country to stop the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines and say we must transform our energy system away from fossil fuels to renewable energy. Today, President Trump ignored the voices of millions and put the short-term profits of the fossil fuel industry ahead of the future of our planet.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/26/donald-trump-dakota-access-pipeline-investment-energy-transfer-partners\">Dakota Access pipeline company and Donald Trump have close financial ties</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cAt a time when the scientific community is virtually unanimous in telling us that climate change is real, it is caused by human activity and it is already causing devastating problems, we cannot afford to build new oil pipelines that lock us into burning fossil fuels for years to come. I will do everything I can to stop these pipelines and protect our planet for future generations.\u201d</p> <p>It was also reported on Tuesday that the Trump administration had instituted a media blackout at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and barred staff from awarding any new contracts or grants.</p> <p>The Associated Press said emails sent to EPA staff since Trump\u2019s inauguration on Friday detailed the specific prohibitions banning press releases, blog updates or posts to the agency\u2019s social media accounts. The Trump administration has also ordered a \u201ctemporary suspension\u201d of all new business activities at the department, including issuing task orders or work assignments to EPA contractors, according to the AP.</p> <p>Spicer, the White House press secretary, denied any knowledge of the gag on the EPA.</p> <p>The president signed the orders with Vice-President Mike Pence, chief of staff Reince Priebus, chief strategist Steve Bannon and adviser Kellyanne Conway among those standing nearby.</p> <p>He also put his name to an order for the pipes themselves to be made in the US. \u201cWe are \u2013 and I am \u2013 very insistent that if we\u2019re going to build pipelines in the United States, the pipe should be made in the United States. So unless there is difficulty with that, because companies are going to have to sort of gear up. Much pipeline is bought from other countries.</p> <p>\u201cFrom now on we\u2019re going to start making pipeline in the United States. If we build it in the United States, build the pipelines, we want to build the pipe. It\u2019s going to put a lot of workers, a lot of steelworkers back to work. OK. We will build our own pipeline, we will build our own pipes. That\u2019s what it has to do with. Like we used to in the old days.\u201d</p> <p>In fact, Democratic senator Al Franken proposed an amendment to legislation forcing the approval of the Keystone XL pipeline in 2015 that would have required the project to use only domestic steel; Republicans unanimously blocked the amendment from consideration. Trump\u2019s own commerce secretary nominee, Wilbur Ross, bought down-and-out American steel companies Bethlehem Steel, LTV and Acme Steel in the early 2000s and revived them under the name International Steel. In 2005, Ross sold those companies to Luxembourg-based ArcelorMittal, one of the pipeline\u2019s major suppliers.</p> <p>Trump signed a further order to streamline the \u201chorrible permitting process\u201d and slashing regulations for domestic manufacturing. \u201cThe regulatory process in this country has become a tangled-up mess, very unfair to people. That\u2019s a big one.\u201d</p> <h2>Supreme court vacancy, Comey stays, Carson approved in committee</h2> <p>Asked by reporters when he would seek to fill the supreme court vacancy, Trump said: \u201cI\u2019ll be making my decision this week and we\u2019ll be announcing next week. We have outstanding candidates and we will pick a truly great supreme court justice.

Both initiatives are part of an environmental policy, he said, that allows Canada to \u201cget our resources to market safely and responsibly while meeting our climate change goals.\u201d Trump also signed the executive order for the Dakota Access pipeline, a $3.7bn project that would transport crude oil from North Dakota through South Dakota and Iowa to a shipping point in Illinois, \u201cagain, subject to terms and conditions to be negotiated by us\u201d. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe, whose reservation is adjacent to the pipeline, staged protests that drew thousands of climate change activists to the rural area of Cannon Ball, North Dakota. Most of the pipeline was complete by last summer except for a small section under Lake Oahe, a reservoir that forms part of the river. The Sioux won a significant victory late last year when the US army corps of engineers declined to allow construction of the pipeline under the lake, saying alternative routes needed to be considered. On Tuesday, the Sioux said the pipeline risked contaminating tribal and American water supplies while disregarding treaty rights. \u201cPresident Trump is legally required to honor our treaty rights and provide a fair and reasonable pipeline process,\u201d said Dave Archambault II, chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe. \u201cAmericans know this pipeline was unfairly rerouted towards our nation and without our consent. The existing pipeline route risks infringing on our treaty rights, contaminating our water and the water of 17 million Americans downstream.\u201d Energy Transfer Partners, the company that wants to build the pipeline, disputes the claim that it threatens the water supply and insists the pipeline will be safe. Obama cancelled the Keystone project in late 2015 after environmentalists campaigned against the project for more than seven years. \u201cAmerica is now a global leader when it comes to taking serious action to fight climate change, and frankly, approving this project would have undercut that leadership,\u201d he said at the time. The house speaker, Paul Ryan, endorsed Trump\u2019s decision to advance the pipeline projects. \u201cIt\u2019s about time,\u201d he said. \u201cThe unfortunate reality is that these important infrastructure projects were used by special interests to advance their radical anti-energy agenda and were therefore needlessly halted by the last administration \u2013 to the detriment of America\u2019s national interest. These pipelines will strengthen our nation\u2019s energy supply and help keep energy costs low for American families.\u201d Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell agreed, saying the Keystone pipeline was \u201cabout much-needed jobs and energy independence for our nation. Unfortunately, President Obama sat on this important project throughout his entire administration, even though his own state department said it had no measurable impact on climate. It is refreshing to have an administration putting jobs and the economy ahead of extreme political views.\u201d But environmentalists expressed disappointment and vowed to fight on. Erich Pica, president of Friends of the Earth, said: \u201cDonald Trump has made it clear that his America does not include the millions of Americans who fought to protect our land, water, sacred cultural sites and climate from dangerous pipelines. Trump has emphatically pledged his allegiance to the oil companies and Wall Street banks that stand to profit from the destruction of public health and the environment.\u201d Rhea Suh, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said: \u201cIt\u2019s appalling that Trump wants to throw open our borders to big polluters. Eliminating the national interest determination process, used by both Republican and Democratic administrations for decades, cedes control of our borders to multinational corporations to jam through cross-border infrastructure projects. And it completely shuts out public engagement in decisions that affect our communities, air, water and climate.\u201d Democrats joined the criticism. Bernie Sanders, senator for Vermont, said: \u201cMillions of people came together all over this country to stop the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines and say we must transform our energy system away from fossil fuels to renewable energy. Today, President Trump ignored the voices of millions and put the short-term profits of the fossil fuel industry ahead of the future of our planet. \u201cAt a time when the scientific community is virtually unanimous in telling us that climate change is real, it is caused by human activity and it is already causing devastating problems, we cannot afford to build new oil pipelines that lock us into burning fossil fuels for years to come. I will do everything I can to stop these pipelines and protect our planet for future generations.\u201d It was also reported on Tuesday that the Trump administration had instituted a media blackout at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and barred staff from awarding any new contracts or grants. The Associated Press said emails sent to EPA staff since Trump\u2019s inauguration on Friday detailed the specific prohibitions banning press releases, blog updates or posts to the agency\u2019s social media accounts. The Trump administration has also ordered a \u201ctemporary suspension\u201d of all new business activities at the department, including issuing task orders or work assignments to EPA contractors, according to the AP. Spicer, the White House press secretary, denied any knowledge of the gag on the EPA. The president signed the orders with Vice-President Mike Pence, chief of staff Reince Priebus, chief strategist Steve Bannon and adviser Kellyanne Conway among those standing nearby. He also put his name to an order for the pipes themselves to be made in the US. \u201cWe are \u2013 and I am \u2013 very insistent that if we\u2019re going to build pipelines in the United States, the pipe should be made in the United States. So unless there is difficulty with that, because companies are going to have to sort of gear up. Much pipeline is bought from other countries. \u201cFrom now on we\u2019re going to start making pipeline in the United States. If we build it in the United States, build the pipelines, we want to build the pipe. It\u2019s going to put a lot of workers, a lot of steelworkers back to work. OK. We will build our own pipeline, we will build our own pipes. That\u2019s what it has to do with. Like we used to in the old days.\u201d In fact, Democratic senator Al Franken proposed an amendment to legislation forcing the approval of the Keystone XL pipeline in 2015 that would have required the project to use only domestic steel; Republicans unanimously blocked the amendment from consideration. Trump\u2019s own commerce secretary nominee, Wilbur Ross, bought down-and-out American steel companies Bethlehem Steel, LTV and Acme Steel in the early 2000s and revived them under the name International Steel. In 2005, Ross sold those companies to Luxembourg-based ArcelorMittal, one of the pipeline\u2019s major suppliers. Trump signed a further order to streamline the \u201chorrible permitting process\u201d and slashing regulations for domestic manufacturing. \u201cThe regulatory process in this country has become a tangled-up mess, very unfair to people. That\u2019s a big one.\u201d Supreme court vacancy, Comey stays, Carson approved in committee Asked by reporters when he would seek to fill the supreme court vacancy, Trump said: \u201cI\u2019ll be making my decision this week and we\u2019ll be announcing next week. We have outstanding candidates and we will pick a truly great supreme court justice. But I\u2019ll be announcing it sometime next week.\u201d Democrats are gearing up for a potential battle over the nomination after Obama\u2019s choice, Merrick Garland, was blocked by Republicans last year. The president stirred up more controversy on Monday night when he reportedly told congressional leaders during a private White House meeting that he lost the popular vote only because 3 million to 5 million \u201cillegals\u201d voted. It is a claim he had made before with no evidence. Ryan said: \u201cI\u2019ve seen no evidence to that effect. I\u2019ve made that very, very clear.\u201d Meanwhile it has emerged that James Comey, the director of the FBI, will be keeping his job under Trump. A justice department memo lists him among officials remaining in their positions. FBI directors are appointed to 10-year terms intended to carry across presidential administrations, even when a new party takes over the White House. Comey is in his fourth year in the job. Trump criticised the FBI during the campaign for its decision not to recommend charges against his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. But he also appeared to warmly greet Comey at a law enforcement gathering over the weekend. Clinton has blamed Comey\u2019s later intervention in the election \u2013 a letter he sent to Congress regarding her private email server \u2013 as crucial to her eventual defeat. Senate committees approved Trump cabinet nominees Ben Carson for housing, Elaine Chao for transportation, Wilbur Ross for commerce and Nikki Haley for UN envoy. Later the Senate voted to approve Trump\u2019s pick for US ambassador to the United Nations, South Carolina governor Nikki Haley.",

          "bodyText": "President Trump could sign an executive order on Monday intended to renegotiate the free trade agreement between the US, Canada and Mexico, it was reported on Monday. The North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), negotiated by George HW Bush and enacted in the 1994 by Bill Clinton, was supported by more Republicans than Democrats. But Trump hammered the deal during his election campaign, focusing populist anger in industrial heartland against trade, and expressed similar sentiments to business leaders at the White House on Monday. \u201cWe want to bring manufacturing back to our country,\u201d the president said, promising to slash regulations. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the reasons I\u2019m sitting here instead of somebody else sitting here.\u201d He added: \u201cWe want to start making our products again. We don\u2019t want to bring them in; we want to make them here. That doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t trade because we do trade, but we want to make our products here. \u201cIf you look at some of the original great people that ran this country, you will see that they felt very strongly about that.\u201d Since winning last November\u2019s election, Trump has singled out and threatened to impose tariffs on US companies that move production to Mexico. On Monday, he promised: \u201cThere will be advantages to companies that do indeed make their products here. It\u2019s going to be a wave. You watch, it\u2019s going to be a wave.\u201d Trump had said on Sunday he planned talks with the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, and the Mexican president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, to begin renegotiating Nafta \u201con immigration and on security at the border\u201d. Citing an unidentified White House official, NBC said the executive order could come on Monday. Canada\u2019s ambassador to the US said it was clear the Trump team were concerned principally about trade deficits with Mexico and China. \u201cI don\u2019t think Canada is the focus at all,\u201d David MacNaughton told reporters in Calgary, Alberta. On Monday, Trump also intends to sign an executive order pulling out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), according to NBC. The TPP, among 11 Pacific rim countries, was backed by Barack Obama but was never ratified by the Republican-controlled Congress. Trump, who was sworn in as the 45th US president on Friday, targeted both trade pacts during his election campaign. His opponent, Hillary Clinton, also spoke out against the TPP. Trump has been accused of hypocrisy because many of his business\u2019s own products are manufactured overseas. In his bleak inaugural address on Friday, Trump described \u201crusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation\u201d and pledged to boost US industries over those abroad. Critics argue that some trends, such as the automation of factories, are irreversible. Trump\u2019s official schedule on Monday includes a 10.30am signing of executive orders in the Oval Office. He began the day tweeting: \u201cBusy week planned with a heavy focus on jobs and national security. Top executives coming in at 9:00 A.M. to talk manufacturing in America.\u201d The new president has a meeting with union leaders and workers in the afternoon, followed by a reception with members of Congress and a meeting with House speaker Paul Ryan. His controversial press secretary, Sean Spicer, will also hold a media briefing. A Senate committee is set to vote on Trump\u2019s nominee for secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, the former head of ExxonMobil. There is speculation over whether Marco Rubio, a senator for Florida, will give his backing. The White House is seeking to recover from a rocky opening weekend in which Trump was criticised for using a CIA appearance to boast about his inauguration crowds and attack the media. Spicer presented false information at his first press briefing. Trump also spoke with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who accepted an invitation to visit the White House in early February.",

This kind of dishonesty in the media, the challenging the bringing our nation together, is making it more difficult.\u201d</p> <p>Spicer also confirmed that the president would meet the British prime minister, Theresa May, in Washington on Friday.

          "bodyText": "Hundreds of thousands of women turned Washington\u2019s National Mall into a sea of pink on Saturday, sending the first concerted message of grassroots opposition to Donald Trump since he moved into the White House. \u201cMinority president\u201d, \u201cWomen roar\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m afraid\u201d were among the signs waved by a crowd which was made up mostly of women but also comprised some men and which far exceeded turnout for Friday\u2019s inauguration. Many wore pink handknit \u201cpussy hats\u201d \u2013 a rebuke to the billionaire businessman once caught on tape bragging about his ability to \u201cgrab\u201d women \u201cby the pussy\u201d. Organisers estimated that more than a million people attended. Later, in a blistering press room debut, Trump\u2019s press secretary, Sean Spicer, accused the press of \u201cminimising the enormous support\u201d that had turned out for Trump the day before. He first accused some media of \u201cdeliberately false reporting\u201d, citing a \u201cparticularly egregious example\u201d of a reporter tweeting that a bust of Martin Luther King Jr had been removed from the Oval Office. \u201cThis was irresponsible and reckless,\u201d he said. The night before, he had tweeted \u201capology accepted\u201d to the reporter, who had apologised for the mistake. On Saturday Spicer went on to say that photographs of the inauguration \u201cwere intentionally framed in a way in one particular tweet to minimise the enormous support that gathered on the National Mall.\u201d Almost shouting, Spicer continued: \u201cInaccurate numbers involving crowd size were also tweeted. No one had numbers because the National Park Service, which controls the National Mall, does not put any out. By the way, this applies to any attempt to count the number of protesters today in the same fashion.\u201d Then, although he had just said that no one had numbers, Spicer claimed: \u201cThis was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period \u2026 These attempts to lessen the enthusiasm for the inauguration are shameful and wrong.\u201d Spicer took no questions, and vaguely said the administration would \u201chold the press accountable\u201d. Only a few hours earlier, President Trump had addressed CIA employees at the agency\u2019s Virginia headquarters, where he mused at length on what he claimed to be the record crowd that witnessed it. The Washington protest march was not the only one held in the US, however. From Atlanta to Phoenix, from Boston to Sacramento, \u201csister marches\u201d staged a show of defiance by ordinary citizens determined to rebuke Trump\u2019s values. An estimated 175,000 took to the streets of Chicago, the adopted home of former president Barack Obama. The large crowd sent a clear signal to a man notorious for his thin skin and prone to boasting about the size of his crowds. In the White House press room, Spicer also described a warm reception for Trump at the CIA, saying the president was given a standing ovation when he spoke there earlier in the afternoon. He blamed Senate Democrats for blocking the appointment of Mike Pompeo as director of the agency. \u201cThat\u2019s what you guys should be writing and covering instead of sowing division about tweets and false narratives,\u201d Spicer admonished the press. \u201cThe president is committed to unifying our country and that was the focus of his inaugural address. This kind of dishonesty in the media, the challenging the bringing our nation together, is making it more difficult.\u201d Spicer also confirmed that the president would meet the British prime minister, Theresa May, in Washington on Friday. Trump spoke on Saturday with the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, and Mexican president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, and has a possible meeting with the latter on 31 January. The noise of popular protest and angry administration statements contrasted sharply with the solemn mood on Saturday morning at the Washington National Cathedral, where Trump, first lady Melania and other family members attended a multi-faith prayer service. The new president then headed to the headquarters of the CIA in Langley, Virginia. He has been critical of America\u2019s intelligence agencies in a way that no incoming commander-in-chief has before, over their belief that Russia sought to influence the election on his behalf. But he used Saturday\u2019s platform to promise the eradication of \u201cevil\u201d radical Islamic terrorism and lambast the \u201cdishonest media\u201d for its reporting of the size of his inauguration crowd. He made no mention of Saturday\u2019s massive protests. It capped 36 hours that began with Trump\u2019s angry call to arms in a blistering inaugural address, an executive order on healthcare and a much-mocked dance with his wife to Frank Sinatra\u2019s My Way at an inaugural ball. As the Obama era receded, Washington remained gripped by uncertainty. Trump\u2019s first week in office could lay siege to Obama\u2019s legacy on numerous fronts and set alarm bells ringing in foreign capitals. When he meets May, trade in the post-Brexit era and the future of Nato, which Trump has questioned, are likely to be high on the agenda. In Washington on Saturday, organisers of the women\u2019s march in Washington first estimated turnout at half a million, which would have been double the number that marched on the city for civil rights in 1963 and were addressed by Martin Luther King. Such estimates only increased. Thousands came by bus, train and plane, cramming Washington\u2019s underground Metro to capacity. John Kerry, the former secretary of state, took to the streets along with his dog. Trump\u2019s defeated election opponent, Hillary Clinton, was not present, but tweeted: There were speeches by politicians and activists and performances from artists including Madonna. \u201cThe revolution starts here,\u201d the singer said. \u201cThe fight for the right to be free, to be who we are, to be equal. \u201cLet\u2019s march together through this darkness and with each step know that we are not afraid, that we are not alone, that we will not back down, that there is power in our unity and that no opposing force stands a chance in the face of true solidarity.\u201d Actor and activist America Ferrera spoke about her background as a child of immigrants and argued that Trump was elected on a platform of hate. \u201cWe are gathered here and across the country and around the world today to say: \u2018Mr Trump, we refuse,\u201d she said. \u201c We won\u2019t build walls and we won\u2019t see the worst in each other.\u201d Feminist Gloria Steinem said: \u201cThis is an outpouring of energy and true democracy that I have never seen in my very long life. It is wide in age, it is deep in diversity and remember the constitution does not begin with \u2018I the president\u2019, it begins with \u2018We the people\u2019.\u201d Film-maker Michael Moore said: \u201cWe\u2019re in day two now of the Trump tragedy.

The scale of the crowd caught even organisers by surprise but thousands pressed ahead with the march while others headed home. There was a steady flow past the White House, where secret service officers stood guard. Pennsylvania Avenue was closed off by steel barriers. Among the marchers was Kathleen Prugsawan, 52, from Washington. She said: \u201cThis is the most peaceful gathering of people unhappy with the current administration. The message that I hope he gets: you better fucking pay attention to us now.\u201d Women and other groups were demonstrating in Atlanta, Boston, Denver, Los Angeles, Miami, Oakland and Seattle. Tens of thousands of New Yorkers marched as close as possible to Trump Tower in midtown Manhattan. There were protests across the world. Organisers in London said 80,000 had taken part in an event there. In Prague, hundreds gathered in Wenceslas Square, waving portraits of Trump and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and holding banners that read \u201cThis is just the beginning\u201d, \u201cKindness\u201d and \u201cLove\u201d. But Trump\u2019s stunning ascent, a repudiation of Democrats and many Republicans, have given succour to rightwing populists abroad. The French far-right presidential hopeful Marine Le Pen joined fellow nationalists on Saturday at a conference in Germany, declaring that 2017 will be the \u201cyear of the awakening of the people of continental Europe\u201d. Meanwhile the Department of Justice announced that federal anti-nepotism laws do not prevent Trump from appointing his son-in-law to his administration. It released a memo to the White House counsel, concluding that the president\u2019s \u201cspecial hiring authority\u201d allowed him to make the appointment. This cleared the way for Jared Kushner, who is married to Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka, to take a post as a senior adviser. Kushner became one of Trump\u2019s closest aides during the election campaign and has been an influential figure in the transition.

Many of them donned so-called \u201cpussy hats\u201d, pink knit hats with mini ears that served as a rebuke of the video leaked during the presidential campaign showing Trump boasting of sexually assaulting women.</p> <p>They brandished signs with Hillary Clinton\u2019s memorable statement as first lady that \u201cwomen\u2019s rights are equal rights\u201d and labeling themselves \u201cnasty women\u201d, a reference to Trump\u2019s jab on the debate stage against the first woman presidential nominee.</p> <p>The tone stood in stark contrast to Friday, when widespread protests to Trump\u2019s inauguration occasionally erupted into clashes with police. The security presence was notably lighter on Saturday, befitting the day\u2019s mood. Parents hoisted young children on their shoulders, while others arrived with babies in tow dressed for the occasion.</p> <p>Car horns sounded as drivers passing by the crowds expressed their approval. Strangers cheered at one another from across the street, waving signs related to women\u2019s issues and more. There were pro-LGBT banners, posters declaring refugees \u201chumans, not terrorists\u201d, and vows that the people would rise alongside sea levels.</p> <p>\u201cHopefully this day is going to be a launch for an ongoing coming together to stand up for our rights, not just as women but as humans,\u201d said Gael Murphy, a co-founder of Code Pink, the left-leaning grassroots organization describing its mission as promoting peace and social justice. </p> <p>\u201cI personally don\u2019t think that Trump is a legitimate president,\u201d she added, citing Russian interference in the US election and structure of the electoral college.</p> <p>\u201cHe has done nothing to prepare for the job,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cBut we\u2019re here and we\u2019re not going anywhere.

Requiring disclosure to officialdom in order to receive support for children is asking women to trust and depend on someone they may prefer not to.\u201d </p> <p>Women\u2019s groups also said they were concerned that the government\u2019s response rejected exempting women who still live with their perpetrator on the grounds that it \u201cwould allow the alleged perpetrator to financially benefit from the abuse.\u201d </p> <p>Krys said: \u201cThis whole policy betrays a lack of understanding about sexual and domestic abuse. Leading figures in this government have previously worked to try to improve justice outcomes for rape survivors, so it is extremely sad to see the insistence on this woman-judging measure by the DWP.\u201d</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-01-21T14:31:45.993Z\">at 2.31pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58836d65e4b0f0efb00f6a02\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-21T14:22:44.931Z\">2.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>My colleague, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elenacresci\">Elena Cresci</a>, says the atmosphere in London is \u201creally jubilant\u201d rather than angry.

English-speaking countries do tend to take their cues from each other and there has been a lot of talk about the similarities between the new presidency and the state of affairs in British politics.\u201d</p> <p>She says the rally is not partisan and Trump is a symptom of the trends they are protesting against, though she admits the billionaire\u2019s inauguration has acted as a catalyst to get people out on to the streets.</p> <p>\u201cTo think that a person who openly supports molesting women for fun now has an international platform on which to espouse that kind of hatred is horrific, and if you don\u2019t speak up about it when it happens elsewhere it will start to happen to you, in your country. It\u2019s not enough to say it\u2019s not us, it\u2019s not here, it\u2019s not happening in my town.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"840fe8d1bf001ab5fad2d7004b3aab44b8881fbc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/840fe8d1bf001ab5fad2d7004b3aab44b8881fbc/0_46_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Louise Westcott, 39, has come to today\u2019s women\u2019s march in Manchester with her husband and two young children, 6 and 3.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Louise Westcott with friends and family.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frances Perraudin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Louise Westcott, 39, has come to today\u2019s women\u2019s march in Manchester with her husband and two young children, aged six and three. \u201cIt\u2019s important to show solidarity with what\u2019s happening in the US.

Trump has denied the allegations.</p> <p>A recent ABC News/Washington Post poll found the businessman and reality TV star had the lowest favourability rating of any incoming president since the 1970s.<br></p> <p>Women in the US gave a host of reasons for marching, ranging from inspiring other women to run for office to protesting Trump\u2019s plans to repeal the 2010 Affordable Care Act, which among other things requires health insurers to cover birth control.</p> <p>Speakers in Washington will include <strong>Cecile Richards</strong> from reproductive health organisation <strong>Planned Parenthood</strong>, activists <strong>Angela Davis</strong> and <strong>Gloria Steinem</strong>, actresses <strong>Ashley Judd</strong> and <strong>Scarlett Johansson</strong>, filmmaker <strong>Michael Moore</strong> and the <strong>\u201cMothers of the Movement\u201d</strong>, a group of mothers whose children died because of violence by the police or gun violence. <strong>Janelle Mon\u00e1e</strong>, <strong>The Indigo Girls</strong> and <strong>Angelique Kidjo</strong> are among the musical acts scheduled to perform.</p> <p>Protests have been taking place across the US over the past day. </p> <p>In San Francisco, thousands formed a human chain on the Golden Gate Bridge and chanted \u201cLove Trumps hate.\u201d In the city\u2019s financial district, a few hundred protesters blocked traffic outside an office building partly owned by Trump.</p> <p>In Atlanta, protests converged at City Hall and a few hundred people chanted and waved signs protesting Trump, denouncing racism and police brutality and expressing support for immigrants, Muslims and the Black Lives Matter movement.</p> <p>In Nashville, half a dozen protesters chained themselves to the doors of the Tennessee Capitol. Hundreds also sat in a 10-minute silent protest at a park while Trump took the oath of office. Organizers led a prayer, sang patriotic songs and read the Declaration of Independence aloud.</p> <p>In the Pacific Northwest, demonstrators in Portland, Oregon, burned US flags and students at Portland State University walked out of classes. About 200 protesters gathered on the Capitol steps in Olympia, Washington, carrying signs that included the messages \u201cResist Trump\u201d and \u201cNot My Problem.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58835633e4b00b8fc2ae3352\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-21T12:42:48.427Z\">12.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Yvette Cooper to give speech urging people to 'not let the clocks be turned back'</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Yvette Cooper, the Labour MP and chair of the home affairs select committee, will be speaking in Trafalgar Square, London, at around 2pm. Below is a copy of her speech:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Today across the globe women and men are marching against hatred. Marching against division. Marching for equality. Marching because we will not be silenced and we will not go away.</p> <p>We are marching because the most powerful man in the country thinks it\u2019s ok to grab women \u201cby the pussy\u201d.</p> <p>We are marching because a talented woman MP was murdered by a far right extremist and we need to call it out as the terrorism it is.</p> <p>We are marching because we believe what Jo Cox said that we have more in common than what divides us and because we won\u2019t stay on the sidelines any more.</p> <p>And we are not just marching, we\u2019re singing, we are shouting, we\u2019re tweeting, snapchatting, facebooking - standing up to the misogynists, the bullies and the haters who try to intimidate and silence people online just as for years they tried to intimidate or silence women on the street, in the pub, in the workplace.</p> <p>Thirty years ago, many of us marched to reclaim the night. Women in Leeds were being told not to go out after dark, because it wasn\u2019t safe, there were too many attacks.</p> <p>Instead they came together - in Leeds, London and across the country to reclaim the night, to take back the streets. Our new streets are online. Social media are our new pubs and clubs. So just as we stood together to reclaim the night we will stand together to reclaim the Internet too.</p> <p>But here\u2019s the tough thing.</p> <p>We are here because we want to take a stand against Donald Trump. Millions of American women and men voted for him. Marching isn\u2019t enough - we need to persuade, to win arguments, to challenge the deep causes of division and to build a future in common.</p> <p>We stand on the shoulders of our mothers and grandmothers - women who have gone before us and won great victories to get us equal pay, abortion rights, rape laws, child care paternity as well as maternity leave.</p> <p>But we won\u2019t be judged on our victories but on how we deal with the setbacks. How we come together and rebuild when it feels like the clock is being turned back.</p> <p>For the sake of our children and grandchildren - our daughters and our sons - we are here because we will not let the clock be turned back now.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-01-21T13:01:13.543Z\">at 1.01pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5883542ce4b01065cf59930d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-21T12:31:59.339Z\">12.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In Bristol, more than 1,000 people marched from Queen Square to College Green \u2013 just 72 hours after the event was organised. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/generallyuseful/status/822773856385515520\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">At the Bristol March in protest against Trump and his campaign of hate.

          "bodyText": "Washington, DC One million people marched in the historic Women\u2019s March on Washington on Saturday, according to initial estimates, in a stunning show of protest on the first full day of the Trump administration. A sea of peaceful protesters wore pink pussyhats as crowds poured into the streets of downtown DC, easily outnumbering those attending the inauguration on Friday. Celebrity performers and speakers included singers Alicia Keys, Madonna and Janelle Mon\u00e1e, activists Gloria Steinem and Angela Davis and actors America Ferrera and Ashley Judd. Los Angeles The LAPD estimates 500,000 people took to the streets of Los Angeles, although event organizers say the number of protesters was even higher, according to the LA Times. It is reportedly the highest turnout for any rally in the city for at least a decade. Chicago Chicago, Illinois saw a huge turn out, with estimates of 250,000 people. The actual march itself was cancelled due to the huge crowds, turning the event into a rally that spilled out of Grant Park. New York Around 200,000 New Yorkers rallied in Midtown Manhattan, double the number of protesters had estimated. The marchers, who had to be staggered in waves because of the numbers, headed up Fifth Avenue towards Trump Tower. \u201cWhat\u2019s at stake is everything you believe in,\u201d said actor Whoopi Goldberg told the crowd. Atlanta Thousands turned out for a social justice march in Atlanta, Georgia, with civil rights hero and congressman John Lewis telling the crowd to \u201cnever quit\u201d \u201cnever give up\u201d and to get into \u201cgood trouble.\u201d \u201cI know something about marching\u201d, he said at the end of his remarks, then the civil rights legend shook hands as he made his way to the front of the march.

Boston More than 100,000 protesters crowded into the Boston Commons, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, one of the fiercest criticisms of Donald Trump. \u201cWe can whimper. We can whine. Or we can fight back!\u201d she declared to the crowd, reports the Boston Globe. Oakland In Oakland, California 60,000 people took to the streets for the local women\u2019s march, with hundreds also rallying in neighboring Berkeley. Austin In Austin, the liberal capital of Texas, police estimated 50,000 people turned out for the local women\u2019s march, 20,000 more than organizers had expected. From the women\u2019s march in Atlanta, Georgia: Dianna Settles owns a store downtown where she has a letterpress, pressed this design for free for anyone going to a women\u2019s march. \u201cI was looking for a quote that was encouraging but also unwavering,\u201d she said. A march in Springfield, Missouri: In DC, the march spilled beyond the mall and took over much of downtown, with throngs of people marching down major arteries of the city a mile north of the official route. Cars are honking in support or annoyance. On Pennsylvania Ave, cheers and boos erupt loudest as groups march past the hotel Trump has developed in the old post office. This might cause some family drama... Best chants of the marches, as heard by our reporters: \u201cWe want a leader, not a creepy tweeter\u201d \u201cCan\u2019t build a wall - hands too small\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s orange, he\u2019s gross, he lost the popular vote\u201d Have you heard others? Add them in the comments! DC police tell the Guardian there have been no arrests or incidents at the Women\u2019s March on Washington today. Earlier today, Bill Miller, the public information officer for the US Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Columbia, released a statement that AO\u2019s office is \u201ccontinuing to evaluate\u201d charges against approximately 230 adults who were arrested in protests and clashes in the nation\u2019s capital around the time of Trump\u2019s inaugural parade yesterday. Wrote Miller: We expect that most of those arrested will be charged by our office with felony rioting, (D.C. Official Code 22-1322), an offense punishable by a statutory maximum of 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $25,000. Those arrested will face hearings at the Superior Court of the District of Columbia today. Over to the west coast, with Julia Carrie Wong attending the Oakland women\u2019s march: The atmosphere was festive at the Oakland women\u2019s march, where organizers estimated several tens of thousands of people took to the streets Saturday morning. \u201cYesterday may have been a dark day for a lot of people, but today is just about the sun coming out,\u201d said Tracie Noriega, an educator from Union City who marched with her daughter. \u201cIt\u2019s hope. You need to find some optimism.\u201d A city with a strong protest culture, the march drew many first time marchers from around the Bay Area. Teresa Medina, a first time protester from Pittsburgh, California, marched with a sorority sister from Sigma Lamda Gamma. \u201cI\u2019m out here just to take a stand against all the hate Trump has been projecting out,\u201d Medina said, adding that Trump\u2019s \u201cdisrespect for Mexican immigrants\u201d was very upsetting for her, since her mother is Mexican. \u201cWe fought so hard not to be stereotyped,\u201d she said. \u201cTo see other people agree with Trump was hurtful.\u201d Another first time protester, Z Wolt of San Leandro, said she was \u201cdisgusted\u201d with Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s diminishing everyone. He\u2019s diminishing American values,\u201d she said. But the Ethiopian immigrant said that she was thrilled to take part in the Woman\u2019s March. \u201cI\u2019m so proud,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel very connected to everyone here, like we are all one.\u201d From Guardian US deputy head of news, Paul Owen, taken near the White House at the DC march: From the NYC march: While the biggest US marches of the day (beyond Washington) are taking place in cities such as Chicago and Los Angeles, plenty of smaller events are under way, too: From elsewhere on the east coast... ...to way out west: Plus, a large gathering in Detroit: And in Boston: Pink hats, pink houses, same difference, right? If you\u2019re marching today, tell us about it. Share your photos and stories, via GuardianWitness. Donald Trump just spoke at CIA headquarters in nearby Langley, Virginia, just outside of DC, however did not mention the hundreds of thousands of women marching against him across the country and world today. He did, however, note how big his inauguration crowd was yesterday. Yep, the smaller crowd is from Trump\u2019s inauguration. Five hours after speeches first began, they are finally wrapping up the DC rally. The speakers and musical performers were supposed to finish at 1pm, so the march as at least two and a half hours behind schedule. The march is still going ahead. From the women\u2019s march in Atlanta, Georgia: Congressman John Lewis addressed the protest crowd in his home district to raucous cheers of \u201cwe love John\u201d and \u201cdistrict five!\u201d (a reference to his congressional district). He encouraged the crowd to \u201cnever quit\u201d \u201cnever give up\u201d and to get into \u201cgood trouble.\u201d \u201cI know something about marching\u201d he said at the end of his remarks, then the civil rights legend shook hands as he made his way to the front of the march. Madonna now singing her 1994 hit Human Nature, she dedicates it to Donald Trump. She gets the crowd to sing along with her: \u201cI\u2019m not your bitch\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t hang your shit on me\u201d \u201cDonald Trump suck a dick\u201d Another surprise celebrity guest! Singer Madonna just came out to speak. \u201cAre you ready to shake up the world? Welcome to the revolution of love. To the rebellion. To our refusal as women to accept this new age of tyranny, where not just women are endangered but all marginalized people,\u201d says Madonna. \u201cIt took this horrific moment of darkness to wake us the fuck up,\u201d she declares. \u201cIt seems as though we had all slipped into a false sense of comfort. That justice would prevail, that good will win in the end. Well, good did not win this election but good will win in the end. \u201cToday marks the beginning of our story. The revolution starts here. The fight for the right to be free to be who we are to be equal. Let\u2019s march together through this darkness and with each step know that we are not afraid, that we are not alone, that we will not back down. \u201cTo our detractors who insist that this march will never add up to anything: fuck you,\u201d she declares. \u201cYes I am angry. Yes I have thought a lot about blowing up the White House. But that won\u2019t change anything,\u201d adds Madonna. She then busts out into her hit Express Yourself. Laila Abdelziz on why she\u2019s marching in DC today: [I\u2019m] here to stand in solidarity with my friends and fellow Nation friends and women. I\u2019ve been a political activist and community organizer my whole life. I\u2019m Palestinian, I\u2019m a refugee. I\u2019m Russian. I\u2019m Muslim. I\u2019m a woman. I care about radically transforming communities to make them healthier and safer. I\u2019ve grown up all over this country. Inequality is increasing dramatically and I see it in my community every day. She was born in Palestine, came to Baltimore as a refugee. Trump started the movement to identify refugees as a threat. To associate politically and culturally and socially people who have been abandoned by every safety net in their societies and have absolutely nowhere to go. Being someone who knows what that feels like, being the first world where there\u2019s so much wealth, I know that we have an obligation to just be human to one another. And I don\u2019t think we\u2019re meeting that obligation. At a time where there are more displaced people than ever in history. Tens of thousands of New Yorkers marched to Trump Tower in Midtown Manhattan for New York\u2019s women\u2019s march, with many local politicians speaking out about Donald Trump. The signs today are so great, this one is also worth a special mention: The march will still be going ahead, says organizers. \u201cYou may have read a story that says we are not marching. I am here to tell you we are marching and we are going to use Constitution Avenue,\u201d said a women\u2019s march organizer. At the Atlanta march, congressman and civil rights leader John Lewis took to the stage. The crowd chants \u201cwe love John\u201d, \u201cthank you John\u201d and \u201cdistrict five\u201d, a reference to Lewis\u2019 district that Donald Trump insulted last week by calling it \u201cfalling apart\u201d (the Guardian went there this week and found affluent neighborhoods). Janelle Mon\u00e1e leading a powerful call-and-response with the Mothers of the Movement, in her song \u201cHell You Talmbout\u201d, with the mothers calling out their children\u2019s names and the corwd chanting back \u201csay his name\u201d. Trans activist Cherno Biko is also on stage, chanting the names of black trans women who have been killed. The Associated Press reports that so many protesters turned out in DC that a formal march cannot go ahead. A massive turnout at the Women\u2019s March on Washington has forced a change of plans. With the entire planned route filled with hundreds of thousands of protesters, organizers can\u2019t lead a formal march toward the White House. That\u2019s according to a District of Columbia official, speaking on condition of anonymity because the official isn\u2019t authorized to speak for the march. But the organizers of the march keep leading chants about marching and note they will soon march and \u201cshut Washington down\u201d once the final performers and speakers have performed. Singer Janelle Mon\u00e1e takes the stage, saying her grandmother was a sharecropper and her mother was a janitor. \u201cIt was woman that gave you Dr Martin Luther King Jr. It was woman who gave you Malcolm X. And according to the bible, it was a woman who gave you Jesus,\u201d said Mon\u00e1e. Surprise guest singer Alicia Keys comes out and starts quoting from Maya Angelou\u2019s Still I Rise poem. Then begins belting out her hit \u201cThis Girl is on Fire,\u201d changing the lyrics to \u201cthese girls are on fire\u201d. Reports that Chicago is the second biggest women\u2019s march after the DC event. From reporter Jamiles Lartey in Atlanta, Georgia: A morning of steady soaking rain gave way just around 1 pm, the scheduled start of Atlanta\u2019s March for social justice and women. Already a large crowd in the thousands had begun to filter in with rain ponchos umbrellas and signs reading \u201crape is not presidential\u201d and \u201chate does not make America great\u201d. The crowd rapidly exceeded the confines of the city\u2019s civil and human rights center, spreading out into the surrounding streets. \u201cI just had to come out and be heard that this is not normal,\u201d said denominator Carla Neal. Over 55 civil rights and social justice organizations made up the coalition putting on the march. Around 1:20pm the first event speakers took the podium to address the crowd ahead of the march heading off for the Georgia state capitol building. From solidarity women\u2019s marches from around the world, via GuardianWitness: Some sweet marchers at the DC event: March organizers Tamika D Mallory, Linda Sarsour and Carmen Perez take to the stage to talk about intersectional feminism, and note that while many white women have only become politically energized and angry because of this election, many women of color have been oppressed and fighting politically for years. Mallory talks about how for many white women the election has made them feel like how black women have felt their whole lives. \u201cFor some of you it is new, for others of us it is not so new at all,\u201d she declares, before listing the names of black people who\u2019ve been killed by police or while in police custody or because of racial violence - Sandra Bland, Philando Castile, Michael Brown, Trayvon Martin. \u201cPut your pride aside, and stand up for the most marginalized people in this society. because if you stand for them, you stand for all,\u201d says Mallory. \u201cDr King said I will not remember the harsh words of my enemies, I will remember the silence of my friends,\u201d declares Mallory. Nothing like a little neighborly love, eh? Allegra Fulton bussed in from Toronto with a band of women who call themselves \u201cthe Nasty Women of the North\u201d. They waved pink flags and wore matching kitten beanies. \u201cWe don\u2019t live here but America lives in us, you know?\u201d Fulton said. She didn\u2019t have time for a long chat as they marched through the crowd getting mobbed by women expressing gratitude for the support of their neighbors. \u201cYou\u2019re all welcome,\u201d one of the Canadian women said. \u201cI love Trudeau,\u201d a woman squealed as they passed, referring to Canada\u2019s prime minister Justin Trudeau, an avowed feminist. Actress Scarlett Johansson calls on people to not be dispirited by the election of Trump. \u201cLet this weight not drag you down, but help to get your heels stuck in,\u201d she declares. She speaks passionately about women\u2019s health, declaring that politicians and pharmaceutical companies shouldn\u2019t be involved in a women\u2019s medical decision. She calls on people to volunteer and donate to women\u2019s health organizations. Former Secretary of State John Kerry joins the march in DC. Sophie Cruz, the 6-year-old who hit the headlines after giving a letter to the Pope calling for her parents not to be deported, takes to the stage with her family: We are here together making a chain of love to protect our families. Let us fight with love, faith and courage so that our families will not be destroyed. I also want to tell the children not to be afraid, because we are not alone. There are still many people that have their hearts filled with love and tenderness to snuggle in this path of life. Let\u2019s keep together and fight for the rights. God is with us. She reread the speech in Spanish and then leads a chant of \u201csi se puede\u201d. Senator from Illinois Tammy Duckworth, an Iraq War army veteran who lost both her legs during her service, took to the stage \u201cI didn\u2019t shed blood for this country, I didn\u2019t give up literally parts of my body to have the constitution trampled on... We did not serve to protect the constitution to have them roll back our rights,\u201d says Duckworth. Duckworth notes how rolling back the American with Disabilities Act would dramatically affect the disabled community and that she wouldn\u2019t be alive without it. \u201cI just sat through two weeks of senate hearings... of people who forget they have millions of dollars in the Cayman Islands... people who don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a safe amount of lead to be in your drinking supply,\u201d she announces, bemoaning Trump\u2019s cabinet picks. Video: Michael Moore \u2018call Congress every day\u2019 Dr Chiona Ndubisi works in a New York hospital and came down with members of her hospital\u2019s family planning department. In the weeks since Trump\u2019s election, many women have asked her what will happen to their birth control coverage. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of questions about what\u2019s next,\u201d said Ndubisi. She held a sign saying \u201cPussy Power\u201d decorated with packs of birth control. \u201cI saw a sign that said, \u2018Too many issues for one sign,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly how I feel. We\u2019ll take it one step at a time. This is a moment to inspire others to act.\u201d Female politicians are en masse on the stage at the DC march and California Senator Kamala Harris addresses the crowd. \u201cI believe we are at inflection point in the history of our country. I believe it is a moment in time that is a pivotal moment in the history of our country,\u201d says Harris, comparing it to when her parents met at Berkeley as part of the civil rights movement in California in the 1960s. Cecile Richards, head of Planned Parenthood, takes to the stage. \u201cMy pledge today is our doors stay open\u201d, she declares, to huge screams of support from the crowd. Over in Chicago, so many thousands of people have turned out to the local women\u2019s march that the march aspect has been cancelled by police, according to local news reports. However, a rally will still go ahead. Crowd organizers estimate 150,000 reporters, according to a Chicago Tribune reporter who tweeted the news: High profile trans writer and activist Janet Mock takes to the stage. \u201cI stand her today as the daughter of a native Hawaiian woman and a black veteran from Texas. I stand her as the first person in my family to go to college. I stand here ...to unapologetic proclaim I am a trans writer woman revolutionary activist of color,\u201d declares Mock. \u201cToday by being here, it is my commitment to getting us free that keeps me marching. Our approach to freedom may not be identical, but it must be intersectional and inclusive. It must extend beyond ourselves. I know with surpassing certainty that my liberation is linked to the trans Latina yearning for refuge,\u201d says Mock. \u201cOur movement is a difficult stpace between our reality and our vision,\u201d she says, noting that people need to return ot heir homes and use their experience to organize and resist. Um... Maybe the images of thousands of women march in the streets around the world against Trump has got him distracted today, because that is not how you spell \u201chonor\u201d. Marcher Andrea Prada, 26, student in DC but is from Colombia: When I came to this country I felt received by the university, by everybody here, by the people of Maryland, it\u2019s a very diverse city. But suddenly when Trump came into the race, he started making racists comments and I noticed that people stopped being ashamed to be racist. I think you should be able to be proud of who you are and not have to be ashamed. I thought we were in a new millennium but with this guy, apparently not. Guardian readers from around the world are continuing to answer our question: Why are you protesting the Trump administration? They\u2019re doing it with Hamilton references in Barcelona: And shout-outs to Hillary Clinton in Bristol: Meanwhile, a snapshot from marchers en route to Washington, DC captures a classic sign: Are you attending the Women\u2019s March on Washington, or a satellite event elsewhere Share your photos and experiences at the event with us, via GuardianWitness. Actress Ashley Judd giving a pretty amazing beat poetry style speech about being a \u201cnasty woman\u201d. \u201cI am not as nasty as a swastika on a rainbow flag,\u201d says Judd. \u201cI feel Hitler in these streets. A moustache traded for a toupee, Nazis renamed, the cabinet electro-conversion therapy the new gas chambers... turning rainbows in suicide notes, I am not as nasty as racism, white supremacy, misogyny, ignorance,\u201d says Judd. \u201cI\u2019m nasty as my grandmothers fought to get me into that voting booth,\u201d says Judd. \u201cWhy is the work of a black woman and a Hispanic woman worth 63 and 54 cents of a privileged white man\u2019s daughter\u2019s dollar?\u201d Judd talks about Viagra and anti-hair-thinning drugs being tax free while menstrual products are taxed. \u201cIs the bloodstain on my jeans more embarrassing than the thinning of your hair?\u201d she asks. \u201cOur pussies ain\u2019t for grabbing. They\u2019re for reminding you that our walls are stronger than America\u2019s ever will. They are for pleasure, they are for birthing new generations ... of nasty woman,\u201d she declares. Outside Washington, up to 2 million people have gathered in cities around the world as part of an international day of action in solidarity with the Women\u2019s March on Washington after Friday\u2019s inauguration of Donald Trump as the 45th president of the United States, writes Nadia Khomami: Here\u2019s a gallery of some of those marches: The tense atmosphere in Washington surrounding Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration, which saw the emergence of anarchists, tear gas and smashed windows, has given way on Saturday to a celebration of pink hats, rainbow flags and \u201cnasty women\u201d. Tens of thousands were expected to mass on the National Mall for the Women\u2019s March on Washington to send a message to the president-elect that their rights would not be compromised. The crowds, bringing women and men from all across the country, packed into buses and trains en route to the spot where Trump was sworn in on Friday as the next US president. Many of them donned so-called \u201cpussy hats\u201d, pink knit hats with mini ears that served as a rebuke of the video leaked during the presidential campaign showing Trump boasting of sexually assaulting women. They brandished signs with Hillary Clinton\u2019s memorable statement as first lady that \u201cwomen\u2019s rights are equal rights\u201d and labeling themselves \u201cnasty women\u201d, a reference to Trump\u2019s jab on the debate stage against the first woman presidential nominee. The tone stood in stark contrast to Friday, when widespread protests to Trump\u2019s inauguration occasionally erupted into clashes with police. The security presence was notably lighter on Saturday, befitting the day\u2019s mood. Parents hoisted young children on their shoulders, while others arrived with babies in tow dressed for the occasion. Car horns sounded as drivers passing by the crowds expressed their approval. Strangers cheered at one another from across the street, waving signs related to women\u2019s issues and more. There were pro-LGBT banners, posters declaring refugees \u201chumans, not terrorists\u201d, and vows that the people would rise alongside sea levels. \u201cHopefully this day is going to be a launch for an ongoing coming together to stand up for our rights, not just as women but as humans,\u201d said Gael Murphy, a co-founder of Code Pink, the left-leaning grassroots organization describing its mission as promoting peace and social justice. \u201cI personally don\u2019t think that Trump is a legitimate president,\u201d she added, citing Russian interference in the US election and structure of the electoral college. \u201cHe has done nothing to prepare for the job,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cBut we\u2019re here and we\u2019re not going anywhere. We will push back.\u201d Just in from Reuters, Washington subway reports 275,000 trips as of 11am today in comparison with 193,000 at the same time on inauguration day yesterday. Filmmaker Michael Moore takes to the stage, says it looks like one million marchers are in DC today. \u201cOK, we got through day one!\u201d he quips. \u201cWe\u2019re in day two now of the Turmp tragedy. Who wants to be in my next movie?\u201d asks Moore. Moore gets a copy of the Washington Post and reads the headline of \u2018Trump takes power\u2019. \u201cHere\u2019s the power. Here\u2019s the majority of America right here,\u201d declares Moore. \u201cWe are here to vow to end the Trump carnage,\u201d he adds. \u201cI want you to call Congress every single day. Every single day,\u201d says Moore. He gives the number to Congress: 202-225-3121 and gets the crowd to chant the number. Meanwhile in Denver a large crowd seems to be gathering... Marcher Kathleen Prugsawan, 52 from Washington DC: I\u2019m not happy to say the least that Trump\u2019s new home is DC. But I\u2019m here marching for everyone who couldn\u2019t be here today. This is the most peaceful gathering of people unhappy with the current administration. The message that I hope he gets: you better fucking pay attention to us now. Over in Athens protestors have gathered outside the US embassy reports our correspondent Helena Smith: Many of the women who have taken to the streets within view of the Acropolis says today\u2019s demonstration is \u201conly the start\u201d of a much broader pressure campaign that will be brought to bear on the Trump administration. \u201cToday\u2019s march is our first demonstration in support of a broad spectrum of human rights. And this is only the start. From here on, we\u2019ll be examining the issues, not just the click-bait. We\u2019ll be writing and calling our elected officials, making our views known, holding their feet to the fire,\u201d said Karen Lee who heads Democrats Abroad which organised the protest rally. \u201cWe expect better for our country, and we\u2019re committed to halting the egregious policies the new administration seems set to ram through.\u201d \u201cThe current representation does not reflect the majority in our country,\u201d added Sarajane Kidd also from Democrats Abroad. \u201c \u201cFor me, it is a question of letting Trump and our lawmakers know that \u2018we are watching you!\u2019\u201d A speaker from the Black Women\u2019s Roundtable notes that they march for the 94% of black women voted for Hillary Clinton - and for the 53% of white women who voted for Donald Trump. Marcher Pooja Panigrahi, 27, from Silver Springs, Maryland: I am so inspired by everyone here. I want to be friends with everyone. We all came with pet causes, but one goal to advance equality. I really think if we band together we can bring about progress. It\u2019s terrifying to think about what happens if we don\u2019t. Feminist hero Gloria Steinem addresses the crowd, commenting on Trump\u2019s inauguration speech yesterday. \u201cEverything that happened before him was a disaster and everything that he would do would be fantastic, the best ever, miracles and all the superlatives. \u201cHe said he was for the people... I have met the people and you are not them,\u201d said Steinem. Just this march today required 1000 more buses than the entire inauguration, noted Steinem. She said she\u2019s been speaking with march organizers at solidarity marches from around the world, saying those in Berlin had a message for the crowd. \u201cWe in Berlin know that walls don\u2019t work,\u201d she read. Steinem noted that \u201cwe have people power we will use it.\u201d \u201cThis is the upside of the downside. This is an outpouring of energy and true democracy that I have never seen in my very long life. It is wide in age, it is deep in diversity and remember the constitution does not begin with \u2018I the president\u2019 it begins with \u2018we the people\u2019.\u201d \u201cIf you force Muslims to register, we will all register as Muslims.\u201d \u201cThis is a day that will change us forever because we are together,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we elect a possible president, we too often go home. We\u2019ve elected an impossible president, we\u2019re never going home. We\u2019re staying together, we\u2019re taking over,\u201d said Steinem. Hillary Clinton isn\u2019t at the Women\u2019s March on Washington today (who can blame her after having to attend the inauguration ceremony AND a luncheon with Donald Trump yesterday), but she\u2019s tweeted her support: Clad in winter coats and standing in front of a paper banner that read \u201cGloria Allred \u2013 Women Seeking Justice Against Trump,\u201d four women who have accused Donald Trump of inappropriate sexual contact announced that they would march together in Saturday\u2019s Women\u2019s March on Washington. \u201cI am here to seek justice, and am pleased with the opportunity to stand shoulder to shoulder with those who march for women\u2019s rights today,\u201d said Summer Zervos, a former contestant on The Apprentice who has accused Trump of groping her and making aggressive, unwanted sexual advances. She added that her presence was meant to inspire others to \u201cstand up to bullies\u201d. The women present included Zervos, who claims Trump\u2019s behavior occurred in 2007, when she met him at his hotel before the two had dinner; Temple Taggart McDowell, who was Miss Utah 1997 in Trump\u2019s Miss USA pageant and accuses Trump of unwanted kissing and touching; and Jessica Drake, an adult film star who claims that Trump kissed and grabbed her without permission and propositioned her for $10,000 at a charity golf tournament. Trump has repeatedly denied their accusations. On Tuesday, Zervos sued Trump for defamation, in response to his denial that their private meeting took place. Taggart said she was marching in support of the other accusers and victims everywhere of sexual assault and harassment. Attorney Allred, 75, huddled near the women as they spoke. She also beamed down from the banner, where she was pictured smiling and standing with her hands clasped behind her back. From the women\u2019s march in Manchester, UK: Shirley Brown, 52, a midwife, has come along today with her 11-year-old daughter Lindy. She says that for her the protest is both about Trump\u2019s election, but also about what he represents. \u201cI\u2019m against austerity and how it effects normal every day people,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd Trump reflects what some people\u2019s views are. People who have got power and wealth want to protect themselves.\u201d \u201cTrump reflects a certain view that is for austerity, nationalism and protectionism and protecting the few rather than the many.\u201d Shirley\u2019s daughter Lindy, says coming to protests \u201cinspires them and motivates\u201d children like her. She says she has become more interested in politics since Trump was elected. A speaker from Moms Rising, an activist group of mothers, spoke about the issue of mothers earning less than other women and men. Mothers earn 71 cents in every dollar compared to fathers. She said mothers of color earn 46 cents in the dollar compared to fathers. Steps away from the crowds, women members of Congress sought to galvanize the spirit of the day by holding events in which they advocated for ratifying the Equal Rights Amendment, expanding access to birth control and fighting Republican attempts to limit access to abortion. California representative Jackie Speier, a Democrat, drew roughly 300 attendees to a breakfast at the US Capitol which brought together advocates such as Patricia Arquette, who memorably called for equal pay for women when accepting an Oscar for best supporting actress in 2015. \u201cToday we made clear to the Republicans in Congress and to the new President Donald Trump that women will not go back to being treated as chattel and second-class citizens,\u201d Speier said. \u201cWe will not stand by and allow the rights which we\u2019ve spent a century working for to be rolled back.\u201d Elsewhere in DC, Donald Trump, Mike Pence and their respective families have just turned up to National Prayer Service at the National Cathedral. They\u2019re attending a one hour prayer service. Marcher Lauren Singerman, 37 from New York City: I am just disgusted by the new administration and the threat it poses to so many people\u2019s rights. I am scared for what happens next now is when the real work begins. It was scary to be in Washington DC yesterday. I\u2019m from New York and I\u2019m not used to being around so many Trump supporters so it felt foreign and surreal. But today it\u2019s really exciting to see so many pink hats and so many people United for actual progress. Actress America Ferrera takes to the stage, speaking about being the child of immigrants and how \u201cour dignity, our rights\u201d have been under attack in this election and that the new president was elected on a platform of hate. \u201cBut the president is not America. His cabinet is not America. Congress is not America. We are America. And we are here to stay,\u201d said Ferrera. \u201cMr Trump, we refuse. We reject the demonization of our Muslim brothers and sisters. We demand an end to the systemic murder and incarceration of our black brothers and sisters. We will not give up our right to a safe and legal abortion. We will not ask our LGBT families to go backwards. We will not go from being a nation of immigrants to a nation of ignorance,\u201d said Ferrera. \u201cWe are, every single one of us, under attack. Our safety and freedoms are on the chopping block... If we don\u2019t stand together fight together for the next four years, we will lose together,\u201d she said. Considering the Trump organizers specifically said the march was not \u201canti-Trump\u201d, these comments are very specifically anti the Trump presidency. The march is kicking off with a very powerful song by an indigenous singer, who called on everyone\u2019s ancestors to look after them today. Now Charlie Brotman, who was the long-time announcer of the inauguration parade, begins an address. An hour before the march began, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transport Authority issued a notice stating that many of the stations encompassing the District of Columbia and neighboring suburbs of Maryland and Virginia were overcrowded. Parking lots at stations as far as an hour outside Washington were deemed at capacity, with crowds captured pouring outside the platforms and onto the streets as loaded trains passed them by. It stood in stark contrast to Friday\u2019s inauguration, when most stations were unusually empty for the swearing in of the next president of the United States. Judy Tong posts this video of huge numbers of buses parked at RFK stadium, a mile and a half east of Capitol Hill: And the Women\u2019s March on Washington has officially begun. A live feed is available to watch on the Women\u2019s March on Washington Facebook page. Thousands of women (and a few men) are there, many wearing the pink hats. The crowd chants \u201cfired up\u201d and \u201cthank you Obama\u201d. Marcher Cindy Yoe, 58, from Prince Frederick, Maryland: I cannot believe I have to be here after all these years. We\u2019ve made so much progress and to go back like this is such a shame. I have never protested in my life. This is the first time and I absolutely thought it was necessary. I have children and grandchildren who will be affected by Trump and his policies. I\u2019m marching for them Because I can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019d be like not to be able to afford healthcare for your baby. Over at the London women\u2019s march: Sarah Fox,33 and Sarah Murphy, 34 were both marching with the London Irish Abortion Rights Campaign to raise awareness of the fight to abolish the 8th amendment in Ireland and make safe abortions legal. \u201cI think until women all come together like this under all of these different banners you can forget the breadth of oppression women are under,\u201d said Murphy. \u201cI think many of the people here feel they are part of a new global women\u2019s movement. They know it\u2019s not going to be a quick fix and they are in it for the long haul.\u201d Reporter Lauren Gambino is stuck on the DC metro with other marchers: We\u2019re stalled on the train because the conductor said we have to wait for the trains ahead of to unload. He\u2019s advising that people who are attending the rally get off a stop early because the next two stops (Archives and L\u2019enfant Plaza) are overcrowded. Thousands of women across the world have marched in solidarity with the Women\u2019s March on Washington, and in 30 minutes the main event officially begins. Here\u2019s how it will go down: The event kicks off at 10am ET with a rally on the corner of 3rd St and Independence Ave. Speakers will include Cecile Richards from reproductive health organisation Planned Parenthood, activists Angela Davis and Gloria Steinem, actresses Ashley Judd and Scarlett Johansson, filmmaker Michael Moore and the \u201cMothers of the Movement\u201d, a group of mothers whose children died because of violence by the police or gun violence. Janelle Mon\u00e1e, The Indigo Girls and Angelique Kidjo are among the musical acts scheduled to perform. At 1.15pm the march will begin down Independence Ave to 14th St SW, then it will head to the Ellipse and the Washington Monument, where the event will finish at 4pm. Marches in other US cities will also take place, with large marches expected in Boston, New York and Los Angeles. Are you at a march? Tell us why you\u2019re marching - and send us pics from the event. You can also tweet to @ambiej. The DC metro is packed as march attendees arrive: Meanwhile, the UK government has been criticised for sticking by its controversial plan to force women to \u201cprove\u201d rape for benefits. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) published its response to a consultation on child tax credit exemptions on Friday, and women\u2019s groups have condemned its contents. Rachel Krys, co-director of the End Violence Against Women (EVAW) coalition, said: \u201cWe are profoundly disappointed to see the publication of these new rules which make entitlement to child tax credit dependent on \u2018proving\u2019 rape. \u201cThe obvious difficulty of requiring women to identify a child as a \u2018product\u2019 of rape, and then having a third party verify this claim, should have been enough to force a complete rethink of the whole policy proposal. \u201cIt\u2019s well known that women are reluctant to disclose rape to anyone, for many reasons including fear and self-protection, guilt, shame and concern for the impact of the knowledge on other family members. Requiring disclosure to officialdom in order to receive support for children is asking women to trust and depend on someone they may prefer not to.\u201d Women\u2019s groups also said they were concerned that the government\u2019s response rejected exempting women who still live with their perpetrator on the grounds that it \u201cwould allow the alleged perpetrator to financially benefit from the abuse.\u201d Krys said: \u201cThis whole policy betrays a lack of understanding about sexual and domestic abuse. Leading figures in this government have previously worked to try to improve justice outcomes for rape survivors, so it is extremely sad to see the insistence on this woman-judging measure by the DWP.\u201d My colleague, Elena Cresci, says the atmosphere in London is \u201creally jubilant\u201d rather than angry. Someone bought some drums down, she says, and lots are wearing the pink pussy hats. Meanwhile, another colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll, is pleased to see so many homemade signs. In Washington DC, where the US\u2019s main march is taking place today, Lauren Gambino reports from the Georgia Avenue-Petworth train station: There are women. Everywhere. In a completely anecdotal and unscientific observation, the Georgia Avenue-Petworth station is much busier than it was yesterday. On the train there are women and signage \u2013 a lot in the vein of \u201cPussy Fights Back\u201d \u2013 and a group of women wearing knit pink hats with kitten ears. There are a few men as well, and one grumpy woman who is clearly annoyed by the disruption to her morning commute. In the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s win \u2013 a tremendous political and cultural loss for women \u2013 I\u2019ll keep you up to date on the worst news, the best news, and everything in between to help you cope with the next four years. Sign up for a weekly email to hear my thoughts about the week in patriarchy. Check out the inaugural newsletter here. The UK isn\u2019t the only European country to show solidarity with women in the US. There have been protests across the continent, as our readers have been showing us. Organisers are expecting around 600 people to attend a rally for women\u2019s rights today in Manchester, the birthplace of the British women\u2019s suffrage movement. The event begins in Manchester\u2019s Albert Square at 1pm and will last until 3pm. The rally will include a minute\u2019s silence to remember \u201cwomen lost and those at risk without the luxury of free speech\u201d. Just around the corner is St Peter\u2019s Square, where a statue of Emmeline Pankhurst is due to be unveiled on International Women\u2019s Day 2019. Jen Langton, 33, a singer and vocal coach, organised today\u2019s rally in Manchester. She says she didn\u2019t have the means to travel to a protest in another city, so she decided to organise one herself. \u201cSometimes when people are saying that somebody should do something, that person is you,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought that if I didn\u2019t do something, nobody might. \u201cA lot of people have been asking why we are doing this, because we\u2019re not the USA. First of all, there are a lot of American students in Manchester who don\u2019t have anywhere to go. But it\u2019s also about showing solidarity. English-speaking countries do tend to take their cues from each other and there has been a lot of talk about the similarities between the new presidency and the state of affairs in British politics.\u201d She says the rally is not partisan and Trump is a symptom of the trends they are protesting against, though she admits the billionaire\u2019s inauguration has acted as a catalyst to get people out on to the streets. \u201cTo think that a person who openly supports molesting women for fun now has an international platform on which to espouse that kind of hatred is horrific, and if you don\u2019t speak up about it when it happens elsewhere it will start to happen to you, in your country. It\u2019s not enough to say it\u2019s not us, it\u2019s not here, it\u2019s not happening in my town.\u201d Louise Westcott, 39, has come to today\u2019s women\u2019s march in Manchester with her husband and two young children, aged six and three. \u201cIt\u2019s important to show solidarity with what\u2019s happening in the US. It\u2019s a bit of a dark time at the moment.\u201d She says the rally is about more than just Trump. \u201cIt feels like there are a lot of bad things going on in this country as well.\u201d She wanted bring her children along today so they could start to understand the point of protest. \u201cIt\u2019s quite difficult to explain to them what it\u2019s about and I\u2019m not sure they fully understand it yet,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it\u2019s the whole concept of having a voice and people coming together with a shared message.\u201d More pussy hats proudly being worn by women (and men) on their way to the Washington DC march. My colleague Alexandra Topping has been speaking to protesters in London. She says huge numbers have turned out for the march, which is still in full force. This tweet helps explain why so many sister marches have popped up across the globe in response to the main one in Washington DC. Tweet and tell me why you are marching @Nicola_Slawson or drop me an email: nicola.slawson@theguardian.com. Back in London, there are quite a few celebrities among the throngs of people carrying placards, including rugby ace Chris Robshaw and Iron Man 3 actor Rebecca Hall. Hall said she joined the march because she is half-American and half-English and if she had been on the other side of her pond she would have joined the Washington DC demonstration. \u201cIt is important for me to march in solidarity,\u201d she said. \u201cYesterday was a confusing day and a sad day, I was sad to see Obama leave \u2026 We do not know what the government is going to be like.\u201d She said Trump\u2019s views, what he said and his politics were aimed at people she cared about \u2013 including \u201cwomen, people of colour, immigrants and the LGBT community.\u201d She added: \u201cIf that is all true then it is important that we all stand up and be here, together, in solidarity.\u201d In Washington DC, thousands of protesters \u2013 many in pink \u201cpussy hats\u201d \u2013 are gearing up to start their march. Read the story behind the hats here: Hello. This is Nicola taking over from Nadia. Wherever you are in the world, please tweet me @Nicola_Slawson and tell me why you are marching or send me a photo of your placard. I would love to hear from you. Here are some more quotes from marchers about why they\u2019re out in force today. Nazila Kivi, feminist magazine editor, Copenhagen: I\u2019m marching in solidarity with people gendered as women all around the world, especially indigenous, queer and migrant women, who are under a double burden of oppression. Women and our bodies very often become battle grounds for conservative and backwards ideas of nations, borders and racist ideologies. Solidarity and activism is all we have. Ritah Mutheu Muia, 37, entrepreneur, Nairobi: We march as the Her Voice society in Kenya because we stand in solidarity with our sisters from the US. We want to send a message that any act or policies that violate human rights or women\u2019s rights will not be tolerated. In Kenya the fight against gender-based violence is far from over. As Kenyan women we have decided to break the silence. I\u2019m handing the live blog over to my colleague Nicola Slawson now. She will continue to track all the latest developments. People have been sharing their images from marches around the world via GuardianWitness. En route to Washington DC: In Melbourne: And in Mexico: Tell us why you\u2019re protesting by clicking on the blue \u2018Contribute\u2019 button at the top of this live blog. The marches taking place in the UK and across the US and wider world are in solidarity with the hundreds of thousands of people expected to descend on Washington DC later today. Although organisers have said the march isn\u2019t specifically anti-Donald Trump, it was timed to take place the day after he was inaugurated as president. Trump\u2019s attitudes toward women dominated the campaign, particularly after a video revealed him saying he could \u201cdo anything\u201d to women, including \u201cgrab them by the pussy\u201d. At least 24 women came forward with allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior by Trump spanning more than 30 years. Trump has denied the allegations. A recent ABC News/Washington Post poll found the businessman and reality TV star had the lowest favourability rating of any incoming president since the 1970s. Women in the US gave a host of reasons for marching, ranging from inspiring other women to run for office to protesting Trump\u2019s plans to repeal the 2010 Affordable Care Act, which among other things requires health insurers to cover birth control. Speakers in Washington will include Cecile Richards from reproductive health organisation Planned Parenthood, activists Angela Davis and Gloria Steinem, actresses Ashley Judd and Scarlett Johansson, filmmaker Michael Moore and the \u201cMothers of the Movement\u201d, a group of mothers whose children died because of violence by the police or gun violence. Janelle Mon\u00e1e, The Indigo Girls and Angelique Kidjo are among the musical acts scheduled to perform. Protests have been taking place across the US over the past day. In San Francisco, thousands formed a human chain on the Golden Gate Bridge and chanted \u201cLove Trumps hate.\u201d In the city\u2019s financial district, a few hundred protesters blocked traffic outside an office building partly owned by Trump. In Atlanta, protests converged at City Hall and a few hundred people chanted and waved signs protesting Trump, denouncing racism and police brutality and expressing support for immigrants, Muslims and the Black Lives Matter movement. In Nashville, half a dozen protesters chained themselves to the doors of the Tennessee Capitol. Hundreds also sat in a 10-minute silent protest at a park while Trump took the oath of office. Organizers led a prayer, sang patriotic songs and read the Declaration of Independence aloud. In the Pacific Northwest, demonstrators in Portland, Oregon, burned US flags and students at Portland State University walked out of classes. About 200 protesters gathered on the Capitol steps in Olympia, Washington, carrying signs that included the messages \u201cResist Trump\u201d and \u201cNot My Problem.\u201d Yvette Cooper, the Labour MP and chair of the home affairs select committee, will be speaking in Trafalgar Square, London, at around 2pm. Below is a copy of her speech: Today across the globe women and men are marching against hatred. Marching against division. Marching for equality. Marching because we will not be silenced and we will not go away. We are marching because the most powerful man in the country thinks it\u2019s ok to grab women \u201cby the pussy\u201d. We are marching because a talented woman MP was murdered by a far right extremist and we need to call it out as the terrorism it is. We are marching because we believe what Jo Cox said that we have more in common than what divides us and because we won\u2019t stay on the sidelines any more. And we are not just marching, we\u2019re singing, we are shouting, we\u2019re tweeting, snapchatting, facebooking - standing up to the misogynists, the bullies and the haters who try to intimidate and silence people online just as for years they tried to intimidate or silence women on the street, in the pub, in the workplace. Thirty years ago, many of us marched to reclaim the night. Women in Leeds were being told not to go out after dark, because it wasn\u2019t safe, there were too many attacks. Instead they came together - in Leeds, London and across the country to reclaim the night, to take back the streets. Our new streets are online. Social media are our new pubs and clubs. So just as we stood together to reclaim the night we will stand together to reclaim the Internet too. But here\u2019s the tough thing. We are here because we want to take a stand against Donald Trump. Millions of American women and men voted for him. Marching isn\u2019t enough - we need to persuade, to win arguments, to challenge the deep causes of division and to build a future in common. We stand on the shoulders of our mothers and grandmothers - women who have gone before us and won great victories to get us equal pay, abortion rights, rape laws, child care paternity as well as maternity leave. But we won\u2019t be judged on our victories but on how we deal with the setbacks. How we come together and rebuild when it feels like the clock is being turned back. For the sake of our children and grandchildren - our daughters and our sons - we are here because we will not let the clock be turned back now. In Bristol, more than 1,000 people marched from Queen Square to College Green \u2013 just 72 hours after the event was organised. The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, is scheduled to join the march. Khan said he was proud to march alongside women and men from London and around the world \u201cto show how much we value the rights every woman should have\u201d. He added: As a feminist in City Hall I fully support the fight for gender equality. It\u2019s wrong that in 2017 someone\u2019s life chances and fundamental rights are still dependent on their gender. In recent decades we\u2019ve made good progress, but there is still so much more for us to do and we must redouble our efforts to make sure that as we strive for equality we do not lose all that we have achieved. As I march today I am more determined than ever to do everything I can to ensure that all girls growing up in London have the same opportunities in life as men. This is the full quote from Trump that has alarmed people the most about his attitude towards women. It\u2019s been circulated widely on social media over the past couple of days. Placards. So may placards! \u201cPizza rolls not gender roles\u201d from Italy is a personal favourite. More marchers explain why they\u2019re pounding the streets today. Aisha Ali-Khan, 36, part-time teacher and carer, Shipley: I wanted to show solidarity with the rest of the women all over the world. Women are not being heard by those in power anywhere in the world \u2013 if they were we wouldn\u2019t be marching today. I\u2019m a Muslim, of Pakistani heritage \u2013 this is not just a white women\u2019s march, it\u2019s all women, all over the world. It\u2019s a really inclusive movement and it\u2019s amazing to be a part of that. Shoomi Chowdhury, Amnesty International, London We have so much left to do with regards to rights for ethnic minorities, particularly women from ethnic minorities, and not only is the potential for progress going to be lost, we\u2019ve taken a massive step back. In 20 years, I want to be able to tell my children: \u2018I went out and marched the day after Donald Trump became president.\u2019 Tube stations in central London, including Oxford Circus and Green Park, are packed with people heading to the march. See more photos below. The Guardian\u2019s Tim Lusher has photos of protesters in London. They\u2019ve come from far and wide, including Liverpool and even Minnesota. If you\u2019re attending a march we\u2019d like to hear from you. You can fill in this form, telling us why taking part is important to you. We\u2019d also like you to share a photograph, or selfie, of you at the protest. You can also email your answers to the questions below along with your photograph to: carmen.fishwick@theguardian.com. You can upload your images and stories through GuardianWitness by clicking the \u201cContribute\u201d button at the top of this blog. But please also tell us why you\u2019re protesting and why taking part is important to you. Thousands of people are gathered outside the US embassy in London, hundreds of them wearing the pink pussy hats that have becoming a unifying symbol of this march. A huge variety of groups have gathered: those campaigning for migrant rights and women\u2019s rights, as well as LGBTQ+ groups and anti-war protesters. But there are also many women \u2013 and a significant number of men \u2013 who have never been on a march before. Lizzy Billington, 62, had come from Cornwall to march with her daughter Alice, 22, and her 18-month-old grandson Isaac. \u201cI haven\u2019t been on a march since the 60s and I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever go on one again but I didn\u2019t want to miss this,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the 60s feminism wasn\u2019t a dirty word and I feel this new movement is more like that. I find it very exciting.\u201d The Women\u2019s Equality party leader, Sophie Walker, said the march was \u201ca powerful antidote to the message of fear and division we heard yesterday.\u201d She added: \u201cIt is incredible to see such an huge commitment from all these people to do politics differently.\u201d Frances Scott, of the 50:50 campaign which wants a more equal parliament in the UK, urged people to sign a petition run by the group. \u201cI\u2019m excited but I\u2019m angry,\u201d she said. \u201cTrump was elected democratically, which shows that we really have to change the system. If we really believe in equality, that has to happen.\u201d The Women\u2019s March in London has begun, with more than 25,000 people expected to gather outside the US embassy in Grosvenor Square and march to Trafalgar Square. It takes place less than 24 hours after Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States. Women and men from around the world have said they hope to send a unity message to Trump after a campaign in which he said Mexican immigrants were \u201crapists\u201d, discussed banning Muslims from entering the US, and was revealed to have once bragged about grabbing women by the genitals and kissing them without permission. The chants are vast and varied. This one, written by Fiona Apple, may be one of them \u2026 More marchers explain why they have taken to the streets today: Rachel Druck, 31, rabbinical student, Tel Aviv: I am studying to be a rabbi and one of the major values of Judaism is accepting the other, making a place for the stranger and remembering once a year that once we were slaves in Egypt. Those values are propelling me. I\u2019m marching because Trump ran a campaign of Islamophobia, antisemitism, misogyny, and racism: to stand up and say he does not speak for me. Natalino Soares Ornai Guterres, 27, consultant, Dili, East Timor: I have been displaced from my home and have travelled to other countries (including the US) in search of better opportunities. Being a member of the LGBT community, I am involved because I understand the struggle that our mothers, sisters and people with non-binary gender identities have to go through in a patriarchal society. Many Guardian staff members or their children are out on the march today. They have been posting pictures and updates on Twitter. Protesters in Bristol, England, are out chanting in the sunshine. In Washington, the former Desperate Housewives star Felicity Huffman has said she will take part in the march with her two daughters, her sister and her niece. She told the Press Association: \u201cI feel that the election was somewhat of a feminist issue. I feel like the best of us was bested by not the best of them.\u201d My colleague Alexandra Topping is at the London march, speaking to people about why they\u2019ve decided to attend today and how they feel. Women are already arriving in droves for the Women\u2019s March on London. The march will begin at Grosvenor Square at 12 noon with speeches presented by the actor Rebecca Hall. Organisers say they aim to allow different voices to be heard. Speakers in Grosvenor Square will include the British playwright Rebecca Lenkiewicz and the Labour MP Stella Creasy. The march will then begin at 12.30pm and will finish at Trafalgar Square at 2pm with a rally hosted by Sandi Toksvig, involving speeches from celebrities and leaders of supporting organisations. These include Women\u2019s Aid, the Unite union, Black Pride and Amnesty International UK. The rally will end at 3.30pm. Hundreds of women, men and children came together in Rome to make their voices heard on several issues, from a feared crackdown on free speech in the US to populism and the marginalisation of ethnic groups. Marchers from around the world have spoken to the Guardian about why they are protesting today. I\u2019ll post a few of these throughout the day. Maria Kostaki, 43, author, Athens: While not a citizen of the US, I am organising this march in Athens because I believe the issues it represents are global. It\u2019s about humanity. It\u2019s about women\u2019s rights, racism, equality, LGBT rights. I have a four-year-old son and I do not want him to grow up in a world where everything we have fought for is taken away. We can\u2019t allow anyone to reverse what we have built. Lotje Horvers, 34, tour manager, Amsterdam I want to be part of the message to the world that there are more people who love than people who hate, and I will not stand by silently while a lying bully is given one of the most responsible positions in the world. I cannot be at peace with the fact he uses his voice to set an example that it is acceptable to be demeaning to women and minorities. Of course, not everyone supports today\u2019s movement, for varying reasons. And here are some of the pictures you\u2019re posting on social media. Pictures are flooding in of preparations and marches. Here are a few from Thailand and Australia. Hundreds of people joined protests in Tokyo, including many American expatriates. \u201cTrump presidency gets my blood boiling \u2026 Everything we value could be gone. It\u2019s time to speak your mind and concerns and to do our best to salvage the values we cherish in America,\u201d said Bill Scholer, an art teacher. In Manila on Friday, about 200 demonstrators from a Philippine nationalist group rallied for about an hour against Trump outside the US embassy. Some held up signs demanding US troops leave the Philippines, and others set fire to a paper US flag bearing a picture of Trump\u2019s face. Protesters in Australia and New Zealand were the first to start marching today. In Sydney, Australia\u2019s biggest city, about 3,000 people gathered for a rally in Hyde Park before marching on the US consulate downtown. A further 5,000 people rallied in Melbourne. In New Zealand there were marches in four cities, involving around 2,000 people. \u201cFeminism is my Trump card\u201d and \u201cFight like a girl,\u201d were among the placards seen in Sydney. Organiser Mindy Freiband told Reuters: We\u2019re not marching as an anti-Trump movement per se, we\u2019re marching to protest the hate speech, the hateful rhetoric, the misogyny, the bigotry, the xenophobia and we want to present a united voice with women around the globe. Many of the protesters in Sydney and Melbourne wore pink hats, which activists referred to as their \u201cpussyhats\u201d. Many said they were worried that Trump\u2019s politics and his attitude towards women and minorities could spread. \u201cAs a mature 56-year-old lesbian, I feel for the first time what is global is local,\u201d said Vicki Skehan. \u201cWe\u2019ve come so far with inclusiveness and I don\u2019t want to see that go away.\u201d Yesterday in Washington more than 200 protesters were arrested as police used pepper spray and stun grenades to suppress a series of small, violent confrontations before and after Trump was sworn in as president. Thousands of protesters from numerous groups descended on DC for mostly peaceful demonstrations throughout the day, but shortly after Trump was sworn in, violent protests broke out in the downtown area close to the north lawn of the White House and blocks from the path of the inaugural parade. A few dozen protesters clad in black threw projectiles at police and barricaded the road with newspaper kiosks and bins, which they later set fire to. The group were quickly surrounded by police in riot gear who used sting-ball grenades and pepper spray, police said, after a black limousine was set on fire. Before the swearing-in ceremony, activists from the anarchist group known as the black bloc smashed storefront windows and cars as they clashed with police. The Women\u2019s March on Washington is expected to be the largest inauguration-related demonstration in US history. A previous demonstration was the Women\u2019s Suffrage Parade of 1913, in which, one day before President Woodrow Wilson\u2019s inauguration, an estimated 5,000 to 8,000 suffragists marched on Pennsylvania Avenue. The parade is considered to be a major milestone for the movement to win women the right to vote, not least because it drew attention to the movement as the thousands of people who were in Washington for the inauguration witnessed the procession. The 1913 march is set to be depicted on the back of the redesigned $10 bill in 2020. Another inauguration that drew strong reaction from the world was that of Richard Nixon in 1968, as the United States fought an unpopular war in Vietnam. Organisers Women\u2019s March Global, the international arm of the Washington march, have said Donald Trump\u2019s election has ignited a powder keg under the global women\u2019s rights movement that will have far-reaching ramifications. As many as 500,000 people are expected to descend on DC, joined by as many as 1.5 million more marching in support in 161 cities across all seven continents. The organisers are determined to capitalise on the wave of activism that has attracted hundreds of thousands of first-time campaigners as well as seasoned activists. \u201cThe women of the world were sitting on a powder keg and Donald Trump just lit the match,\u201d Evvie Harmon, a Women\u2019s March co-founder and global coordinator, told the Guardian. Set up after Trump\u2019s election victory, the global movement is being hailed as an unprecedented grassroots movement, and organisers say it will have an immediate and concrete impact. Many international coordinators say they are marching in solidarity with US women, but that human rights and not Donald Trump are the focus. Cells set up throughout the US and hundreds of other places are plotting local campaigns, from preventing the construction of oil pipelines to outlawing female genital mutilation. They will adhere to the \u201cguiding vision\u201d of the Women\u2019s March on issues such as the rights of immigrant, disabled and LGBTQIA women and female workers. Individual groups will decide which targeted actions to take. Marches are due to take place in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and Erbil, Iraq where an organiser from Alliance for Peace and Human Rights (APHRO) said holding the march was a challenge because of tribalism, corruption and the difficulty of getting approval from the government \u201cwho deny that women have challenges in this Iraqi society,\u201d such as lack of salaries, terror, hate, exploitation and trafficking. Harmon added: I don\u2019t know any grassroots organisation that has grown to this size in only two months. There are now about 1,000 coordinators around the world. It\u2019s too big and it\u2019s growing too fast to control. And we wouldn\u2019t want to. We just want to support and help it to flourish. In the UK at least 14 marches, demonstrations and gatherings are planned. In London, tens of thousands of people are planning to turn out in solidarity, and sister demonstrations are also being held in Bangor, Barnstaple, Belfast, Bristol, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Lancaster, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Shipley, Southampton, St Austell and York. The London march starts at midday at the US embassy: 24 Grosvenor Square, W1A 2LQ. Marchers plan to assemble in front of the embassy before making their way to Trafalgar Square for a 90-minute rally from 2pm. People who would rather take a shorter route can join the march where Pall Mall meets Waterloo Place. Everything you need to know about the UK marches can be found in our report below. The Women\u2019s March on Washington starts at 10am EST, near the south-east corner of the National Mall. But before and after then, many women\u2019s marches are taking place across the US and around the world. There are marches planned in every state in the US, as well as many countries in Europe, Central and South America, Africa, Asia and various cities across Canada and Australia. Those marching outside the US are doing so in solidarity with American women and standing up for the rights of women in their own countries. A map on the Women\u2019s March website allows you to search for the sister march closest to you. Here is a list of all the countries in which marches are taking place. Some of them will see numerous marches across different cities.

Although the organisers say the march isn\u2019t specifically anti-Donald Trump, it was timed to take place the day after the businessman and former reality TV star was inaugurated as the 45th president of the United States, to the dismay of many who had been appalled by his record on the election trail. Trump\u2019s attitudes toward women dominated the campaign, particularly after a video revealed him saying he could \u201cdo anything\u201d to women, including \u201cgrab them by the pussy\u201d. At least 24 women came forward with allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior by Trump spanning more than 30 years. Trump has denied the allegations. Today women \u2013 and men \u2013 are taking to the streets to \u201csend a bold message to our new government on their first day in office, and to the world that women\u2019s rights are human rights\u201d, according to the march\u2019s official mission. The event kicks off at 10am ET with a rally on the corner of 3rd St and Independence Ave. Speakers will include Cecile Richards from reproductive health organisation Planned Parenthood, activists Angela Davis and Gloria Steinem, actresses Ashley Judd and Scarlett Johansson, filmmaker Michael Moore and the \u201cMothers of the Movement\u201d, a group of mothers whose children died because of violence by the police or gun violence. Janelle Mon\u00e1e, The Indigo Girls and Angelique Kidjo are among the musical acts scheduled to perform. At 1.15pm the march will begin down Independence Ave to 14th St SW, then it will head to the Ellipse and the Washington Monument, where the event will finish at 4pm. Other celebrity guests include singers Cher, Katy Perry and Zendaya, model Chrissy Teigen, comedians Amy Schumer and Cristela Alonzo, TV host Padma Lakshmi, artist Kara Walker, and actresses Hari Nef, Amandla Stenberg, Frances McDormand, Uzo Aduba, America Ferrera and Julianne Moore. Women from all over the country are pouring into DC, with trains, planes and buses full of marchers arriving on Friday and early Saturday morning. For those attending, Nicole Puglise put together a guide to what you can and can\u2019t bring to the march (yes to posters, no to colored backpacks). More than 280 independently organized marches will also be held in solidarity in all 50 states. A regularly updated map on the march website allows people to search by zipcode for their nearest event. More than 20 countries will also host solidarity marches, with nations including Australia, Canada, Portugal and Mexico and the UK holding events. Guardian reporters including Molly Redden, Lauren Gambino, Sabrina Siddiqui and Laurence Mathieu-L\u00e9ger will at the DC march to provide live updates. We\u2019ll provide interviews, news and photos from the march all day. Stay tuned.",

But domestic broadcasters were forbidden from screening Trump\u2019s inaugural speech live, with authorities perhaps fearful it might contain more attacks on the country\u2019s Communist party leaders.</p> <p>Instead Xiong Tong, a Beijing-based journalist and self-declared Trump aficionado, tuned in at home on the internet.

While there is no doubt that the Russian political establishment are cautiously optimistic about relations under Trump, modern Russia is a largely apolitical country, and there was little sense of genuine excitement among ordinary Russians.</p> <p>\u201cWe are ready to do our share of the work in order to improve the relationship,\u201d prime minister Dmitry Medvedev wrote on Facebook on Friday.</p> <p>The pro-Trump atmosphere that was visible in Moscow was largely of a tongue-in-cheek character, trolling the hated US \u201cestablishment\u201d and what Russians hope will be the end of a US that lectures them on human rights. The Army of Russia shops in central Moscow offered all Americans 10% off merchandise on inauguration day, while the occasional restaurant offered a Trump burger or other gimmick. </p> <p>While there were continued denials about Russian meddling in the election, there was also a pride in Russia\u2019s central place in the dialogue. At the celebration, one man wore a T-shirt with \u201cYou\u2019ve been hacked\u201d inscribed on it. <strong>Shaun Walker in Moscow</strong></p> <h2>Iran</h2> <p>In Iran, the national television did not broadcast the inauguration live, reporting on its news bulletin that \u201cthe new US president had begun his work amid popular protests\u201d. Semi-official agencies gave a scant coverage to the event, partly due to continuing news from Thursday\u2019s devastating fire in Tehran. <br></p> <p>Many, however, followed the ceremony on the London-based BBC Persian, which is loathed by the Iranian establishment. Watched by millions in Iran via illegal satellite dishes, BBC Persian had its main presenter in Washington DC and aired the ceremony in full.

          "bodyText": "Germany Germany will need a new economic strategy geared toward Asia should the new US administration start a trade war with China, vice chancellor Sigmar Gabriel said, warning of a \u201crough ride\u201d hours after Donald Trump was sworn in. \u201cWhat we heard today were high nationalistic tones,\u201d Gabriel said in an interview with the public broadcaster ZDF, in the first official German reaction to Trump\u2019s inauguration. \u201cI think we have to prepare for a rough ride.\u201d He added that Trump \u201cwas extremely serious\u201d in his inauguration speech, which meant he would follow his promises on trade and other issues with actions. Europe and Germany must stand together \u201cto defend our interests.\u201d As the US\u2019s new president took to the stage in Washington, hundreds of anti- and pro-Trump protesters gathered in front of Berlin\u2019s Brandenburg Gate. Margaret Heidhues, of upstate New York, said she had not been able to stay at home to watch the inauguration. \u201cI would have been repulsed beyond belief,\u201d she said, holding a banner stating: \u201cThe People Voted for Hillary\u201d on one side, and \u201cNasty Woman\u201d, on the other side. Her nine-year-old son Theo had crafted his own poster with a digger truck on it and the slogan \u201cDump Trump\u201d. \u201cI think he poses an incredible danger to Europe,\u201d said Heidhues, who has lived in Germany since 2000. \u201cThe populist movements of the AfD [Alternative for Germany] and Le Pen\u2019s [Front National] in France have been emboldened by his victory. \u201cWhen he was first elected, my German friends were expressing their sympathy towards me. But now they are just as depressed, because they recognise they have to be scared for themselves as well.\u201d On Pariser Platz square, where the protesters gathered, they were faced by a line of around 10 Trump supporters, carrying banners that read: \u201cTrump, the better alternative\u201d and \u201cTrump wants peace with Russia! What is wrong with that?\u201d. Sylvia Block, a pensioner who said she was part of a group called Mothers Against War said she liked Trump because he was a \u201cgrounded, down-to-earth personality will would look after the American people\u201d and who would build up American industry: \u201cThe Americans have too much unemployment \u2013 Trump will bring their industry back to its feet so that Americans can buy their own cars again, not import them from us\u201d. The anti-Trump protesters called their march \u201cNo to Global Trumpism\u201d. It started at the headquarters of the rightwing populists AfD and marched towards the Brandenburg Gate. \u201cTrumpism is not an isolated national movement\u201d, the march organisers said in their pre-protest blurb. \u201cWe stand united against opportunists such as Frauke Petry and the AfD, Marine Le Pen, Geert Wilders and Nigel Farage who scapegoat and demonise immigrants and religious and ethnic minorities to build their own political power.\u201d The demonstration was organised by a variety of groups including American Voices Abroad Berlin, Berlin Forum on Global Politics, Berlin Ireland Pro Choice, Pussy Grabs Back and many others. The protests took place on the eve of a meeting of Europe\u2019s rightwing populists, feeling strengthened by the Trump victory and Brexit, who are due to gather in the central city of Koblenz in a show of strength ahead of a string of elections this year in which they are predicted to make gains. Wilders, of the Dutch far-right Freedom party, and Matteo Salvini of Italy\u2019s northern league, are expected at the meeting. The star attractions at what has been billed a \u201cEuropean Counter Summit\u201d will be France\u2019s presidential hopeful Le Pen and AfD\u2019s Petry, who are due to hold a discussion on the folly of Angela Merkel\u2019s refugee policy. Philip Oltermann and Kate Connolly in Berlin Taiwan Taiwanese president Tsai Ing-wen congratulated Trump on his inauguration on Twitter, in a move likely to draw objections from Beijing, which is already angry with a protocol-breaking phone call a month ago between the two leaders. China After Donald Trump promised in his inauguration speech to fight back against the \u201cravages of other countries\u201d, China\u2019s Global Times, a Communist party tabloid, said the \u201cimpressive\u201d address signalled that the start of the Trump era would herald \u201cdramatic changes\u201d. \u201cOn the world stage Mr Trump will likely align his foreign policy with US corporate interests, blurring the lines of ideology or political values. Frictions between the US and its allies, and trade tensions between the US and China seem inevitable within the four years ahead,\u201d the state-run newspaper said in an editorial. \u201cUndoubtedly the Trump administration will be igniting many \u2018fires\u2019 on its front door and around the world. Let\u2019s wait and see when it will be China\u2019s turn.\u201d China\u2019s government and state-run media had struck a conciliatory tone on the eve of the inauguration \u2013 \u201cBoth sides should try to be friends and partners, rather than opponents or enemies,\u201d said Hua Chunying, a spokesperson for China\u2019s foreign ministry. But domestic broadcasters were forbidden from screening Trump\u2019s inaugural speech live, with authorities perhaps fearful it might contain more attacks on the country\u2019s Communist party leaders. Instead Xiong Tong, a Beijing-based journalist and self-declared Trump aficionado, tuned in at home on the internet. The 32-year-old said he was overjoyed to see the billionaire pick up the keys to the White House. \u201cTrump is fantastic,\u201d said Xiong who donned a Trump t-shirt \u2013 as well as a synthetic blonde mop \u2013 for his celebratory late-night viewing session. \u201cHe is so real. Thanks to him, the world is going to start heading in a positive direction. People will become more confident, which will lead to a rise on the stock market.\u201d Xiong said he saw similarities between the US\u2019s incoming leader and former Republican president, George HW Bush. \u201cBoth of them are easy going and hard-working,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are formidable people.\u201d He said he was unfazed that weeks of China-bashing by the billionaire meant he was now part of a shrinking pool of Chinese Trump supporters. \u201cI\u2019m an independent fan of his and I don\u2019t care what others think about the man,\u201d declared Xiong. \u201cI think Trump acts the same way.\u201d Nor was he worried about the prospect of confrontation with the world\u2019s most powerful military if Trump continued to challenge Beijing from the White House, saying: \u201cIf we start a fight with the US, beat them and conquer them, they will not dare to interfere with our South China Sea.\u201d Tom Phillips and Wang Zhen in Beijing Mexico Most Mexicans are torn as to who they hate more: Donald Trump for his repeated insults and threats on trade, migration and jobs; or their president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, for trying to appease him by extraditing drug capo Joaquin \u2018El Chapo\u2019 Guzman to the US on the eve of the inauguration, thus ensuring the cartel boss will never pay for his crimes at home. A series of demonstrations are set to take place in the capital, Mexico City, this weekend to protest against Trump\u2019s anti-Mexico rhetoric. In a series of thinly veiled threats directed at Mexico, which were peppered throughout his inauguration speech, Trump pledged to protect American borders from the ravages of other countries, and bring back jobs, borders, wealth and prosperity. Pe\u00f1a Nieto congratulated Trump on his inauguration, but said: \u201cSovereignty, national interest and protection of Mexicans, will guide relations with the new government of the United States.\u201d He added that his government would \u201cestablish a respectful dialogue\u201d with Trump\u2019s administration \u201cfor the benefit of Mexico\u201d. The foreign minister, Luis Videgaray Caso, and finance minister Ildefonso Guajardo Villarreal, will hold talks with members of Trump\u2019s cabinet on 25 and 26 January in Washington. Amalia Ortiz Cortez, 31, a festival organiser, said the emotional and economic damage inflicted on Mexico by Trump\u2019s discourse had until now made the government look weak, but his promised anti-Mexican policies could unite the nation for the first time in many years. \u201cIt made me feel very sad but it\u2019s now clear that the speculation is over, and he literally means what he has said,\u201d Cortez said. \u201cOur government must strongly remonstrate against his discourse in line with social consensus and re-examine our foreign relations and trade deals \u201cTrump will bring business leaders, young people and the general population together to dialogue and I hope this will force us to become stronger as a society and reconsider our relationships with our Latin American neighbours.\u201d Nina Lakhani in Mexico City Russia Russia has loomed unusually large in this presidential campaign and its aftermath, and at the Telegraph building not far from the Kremlin, a group of nationalist activists put on an inauguration party to celebrate the victory of the man who has come to be seen as the Kremlin\u2019s candidate, with champagne and traditional Russian pies for guests. \u201cWe started this movement a year ago when nobody believed in Trump except us,\u201d said Maria Katasonova, a nationalist activist who helped organise the party. \u201cI hope the words he said during the campaign were not just rhetoric and stick by them as president.\u201d She said Trump was a man, like Putin, who \u201cfights the system\u201d. However, there were more journalists at the party than genuine Trump enthusiasts and there was a sense that the jubilation was a little artificial. While there is no doubt that the Russian political establishment are cautiously optimistic about relations under Trump, modern Russia is a largely apolitical country, and there was little sense of genuine excitement among ordinary Russians. \u201cWe are ready to do our share of the work in order to improve the relationship,\u201d prime minister Dmitry Medvedev wrote on Facebook on Friday. The pro-Trump atmosphere that was visible in Moscow was largely of a tongue-in-cheek character, trolling the hated US \u201cestablishment\u201d and what Russians hope will be the end of a US that lectures them on human rights. The Army of Russia shops in central Moscow offered all Americans 10% off merchandise on inauguration day, while the occasional restaurant offered a Trump burger or other gimmick. While there were continued denials about Russian meddling in the election, there was also a pride in Russia\u2019s central place in the dialogue. At the celebration, one man wore a T-shirt with \u201cYou\u2019ve been hacked\u201d inscribed on it. Shaun Walker in Moscow Iran In Iran, the national television did not broadcast the inauguration live, reporting on its news bulletin that \u201cthe new US president had begun his work amid popular protests\u201d. Semi-official agencies gave a scant coverage to the event, partly due to continuing news from Thursday\u2019s devastating fire in Tehran. Many, however, followed the ceremony on the London-based BBC Persian, which is loathed by the Iranian establishment. Watched by millions in Iran via illegal satellite dishes, BBC Persian had its main presenter in Washington DC and aired the ceremony in full. Iran\u2019s state-run English language website Press TV broadcast the ceremony. One headline on its website reflected an activist\u2019s view: \u201cTrump forced on Americans by two-party system\u201d. Iranians are concerned about the impact of Trump\u2019s presidency on the landmark nuclear agreement, struck in Vienna in July 2015. Trump told the Times this month that he saw it as \u201cone of the worst deals ever made\u201d but refused to give further details about his policy on Iran, because, he said: \u201cI just don\u2019t want to play the cards\u201d. Some analysts say he may not tear up the agreement but instead could adopt a more rigorous implementation of the accord. Tehran University professor Naser Hadian told the Guardian: \u201cTrump is an unknown phenomenon and nobody knows how his words would translate into policies, so we don\u2019t know what he would do with the nuclear deal.\u201d According to Hadian, Trump\u2019s appointments so far have not been promising. \u201cThey have been hawkish and have talked about regime change or war with Iran,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the negative side, Trump is the combination of a clever mind with little knowledge, which makes him incredibly dangerous, but on the positive side, he is a pragmatist and a businessman.\u201d Saeed Kamali Dehghan Israel and the Palestinian territories Trump\u2019s inauguration sharply divided opinion, with rightwing pro-settlement Israelis \u2013 whose leaders were invited to attend the ceremony \u2013 most enthusiastic. In a pointed intervention, Israel\u2019s infrastructure minister Yuval Steinitz \u2013 a close confident of Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u2013 said he hoped Trump would act quickly on his controversial plan to relocate the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a plan fiercely opposed by Palestinians who see east Jerusalem as a capital of a future state. \u201cI hope and believe that he will move the American Embassy to Jerusalem,\u201d Steinitz told Army radio. \u201cIt is absurd that the embassies are in Tel Aviv.\u201d Netanyahu also tweeted his congratulations ahead of the beginning of shabbat. In the Nana cafe in east Jerusalem, however, the clientele watched the inauguration with a mixture of bafflement and concern over the fact the US had elected Trump while warning of the consequences of moving the embassy. Moussa al-Bitouni, 53, father of the cafe\u2019s owner said : \u201cFrom what I hear he is not a man of peace. We does not want to support peace. This is not in our interest or the interest of the US. I was 100% for Clinton. I never thought America would elect Trump.\u201d \u201cWe want him to be fair, not biased,\u201d added lorry driver Faraj al-Joulem, 42. . \u201cWe are against moving the US embassy. It will inflame the whole region.\u201d Israel\u2019s newspaper columnists were split, however, about what Trump portends, while Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas, in a statement posted in his name on the official Palestinian news agency Wafa, congratulated Trump. He added: \u201cI look forward to working with him for the sake of peace, security and stability in a world that is troubled and in a region that lives a tragic era, and to contribute to creating a safe future for everyone.\u201d UK Before Trump had even arrived at Capitol Hill disgruntled Britons \u2013 including Green party joint leader Jonathan Bartley \u2013 had unfurled a banner reading \u201cBuild bridges not walls\u201d across London\u2019s Tower Bridge , while others held up a sign saying \u201cAct Now\u201d. \u201cWe won\u2019t let the politics of hate peddled by the likes of Donald Trump take hold,\u201d said protest organiser Nona Hurkmans. Other banners were draped over Westminster Bridge during a protest outside parliament. British prime minister Theresa May did not send wishes to Trump before his swearing in, but leader of the opposition Jeremy Corbyn urged him to put the \u201cmisogyny and the racism\u201d of his presidential campaign behind him. Speaking at an event in Glasgow, Corbyn said he hoped that as president he would reach \u201cout to all communities across the United States\u201d and called on him to promote \u201ccritical engagement\u201d with Russia. The foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, tweeted his congratulations to both Trump and the vice president Mike Pence, but the Liberal Democrat leader, Tim Farron, called Trump\u2019s journey to the White House \u201cthe most divisive, vulgar and illiberal presidential campaign in memory\u201d before calling on May to stand up to Trump. \u201cOf course the UK must continue to engage with the US on matters of mutual concern, but Theresa May must not to damage our national integrity and values by bowing down to a bully,\u201d he said. Protests against Trump also took place across Scotland. Hundreds marched from the foot of Edinburgh\u2019s North Bridge to the US consulate on Regent Terrace to coincide with Trump being sworn in. Protesters were armed with banners with wording including: \u201cLove Trumps Hate\u201d, \u201cNo to racism, no to Trump\u201d and \u201cHey Donald, I hope you step on a lego\u201d. The demonstration organised in the Scottish capital by Stand Up to Racism saw hundreds of people chant slogans such as \u201cDonald Trump go to hell \u2013 take the KKK as well\u201d and \u201cDonald Trump, go away \u2013 sexist, racist, anti-gay\u201d. Trump was welcomed by some rightwing politicians, including Ukip\u2019s Nigel Farage, but Sir Nigel Sheinwald, the former UK ambassador to the US, questioned his ability to unify the US and stand up to Russia. \u201cThe really big test is over Russia and Nato,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cOver the next few months, you are going to have to see whether a harder edge comes into his approach to Russia, and whether he is prepared to validate a sense of commitment to Nato and to Europe.\u201d Downing Street is trying to arrange for May to travel to meet the new president as soon as possible, with speculation that a visit take place within days. Alexandra Topping France In a small bar in Paris\u2019s M\u00e9nilmontant neighbourhood, Trump\u2019s speech was relayed on a giant screen. As he gave the pledge, a 20-something sighed and said: \u201cWell, there goes America.\u201d But another regular chipped in: \u201cI hurt for the American people. Half of the population didn\u2019t vote for him. They\u2019ll have to endure the next few years.\u201d One of the waiters doubted that Trump could fulfil many of his election promises \u201cWhat is he going to do?\u201d he said. \u201cSend all the immigrants back? Line them up against a wall and shoot them?\u201d A survey on Friday showed that more than 80% of the French population had a bad or very bad opinion of Trump. Some are anxious that his electoral success increases the chances of victory for its own anti-immigrant nationalist leader, Le Pen, in elections this year. The president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, did not mention Trump by name during a press conference in eastern France, referring instead to \u201cmy colleague taking the oath\u201d and criticising the protectionism that Trump advocated. The French president has previously said that Trump\u2019s victory \u201copens up a period of uncertainty\u201d that \u201cmust be faced with lucidity and clarity\u201d. Sofia Fischer in Paris Canada Canada\u2019s government, eager to sidestep potentially protectionist US policies, said it was confident Trump would see that working closely with Canada benefited both nations. \u201cWe are confident the new administration will see that Canada\u2019s partnership with the US mutually strengthens our two nations and provides real opportunities to grow our respective economies,\u201d Joseph Pickerill, spokesman for foreign minister Chrystia Freeland, said in a statement.

There is, however, a shortcut to permanent residency: if you cohabit with a Canadian citizen for a year or more, they can sponsor you. Despite what you may have heard, however, Canadians guard their, uh, resources carefully. Here\u2019s how to get your \u201cfoot\u201d in the \u201cdoor\u201d. Location, location, location Unlike Australians, Ethiopians and in fact every other nationality, Canadians don\u2019t tend to congregate in neighbourhoods. No city on Earth has a Little Canada. Canadians do, however, require shelter like other human beings: try Gumtree or Craigslist and you might be able to attract one to your house. They are sometimes spotted near youth hostels, sports bars and political protests. If that fails, note that they\u2019re also more susceptible to cold \u2013 all that time spent behind double-glazed windows in super-insulated homes has made them soft.
