Here is what we know so far this morning:</p> \n  <p>\u2022 Independent centrist <strong>Emmanuel Macron</strong>, 39, who was unknown three years ago, has become France\u2019s youngest-ever president after a 66% to 34% victory in the second round run-off against the far-right Front National\u2019s <strong>Marine Le Pen</strong>.</p> \n  <p>\u2022 The resounding win has been hailed by his supporters as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/07/theresa-may-congratulates-macron-on-victory-as-eu-breathes-sigh-of-relief\">holding back a tide of populism</a> after the <strong>Brexit</strong> vote and <strong>Donald Trump</strong>\u2019s victory in the US election.</p> \n  <p>\u2022 In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/08/a-new-page-has-been-turned-macron-eschews-triumphalism-in-victory-address\">Macron\u2019s fairly subdued victory speech</a> the political outsider vowed to unite a divided and fractured France, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/07/emmanuel-macron-wins-french-presidency-marine-le-pen\">saying the world was watching</a> and \u201cwaiting for us to defend the spirit of the Enlightenment, threatened in so many places\u201d.</p> \n  <p>\u2022 Despite her loss, Le Pen\u2019s score marked a<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/07/marine-le-pen-defeated-front-national-far-from-finished\"> historical high point for the French right</a>. In a defiant concession speech, Le Pen said she was leader of \u201cthe biggest opposition force\u201d in France and vowed to radically overhaul her party.</p> \n  <p>\u2022 With 99.99% of ballots counted early on Monday, Macron had 66.06% of the vote, and Le Pen 33.94%. Turnout was 74.62% \u2013 the lowest in 40 years.</p> \n  <p>\u2022 Macron now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/may/07/the-guardian-view-on-the-french-election-good-luck-mr-macron-you-will-need-it\">faces the challenge</a> of trying to win a parliamentary majority for his fledgling political movement En Marche! in legislative elections next month.

          "bodyText": "We are wrapping up our French presidential liveblog for the day. All the latest developments can be found in our most recent story and you can read about potential interference in the election by Russian-affiliated hackers here. Thanks for tuning in. And vive la France! The final count in the second round of the 2017 French presidential election saw Macron take 66.1% of the vote; Le Pen took 33.9%. Russian President Vladimir Putin has called on France to \u201covercome mutual mistrust\u201d in the wake of Emmanuel Macron\u2019s victory. The \u201cmassive and coordinated\u201d attack on the campaign of France\u2019s president-elect has been linked the same Russian-affiliated group accused for interfering the US election. German chancellor Angela Merkel has said Macron carries the hope of \u201cmillions\u201d of Europeans. British prime minister Theresa May congratulated Macron and used his election to ask the British electorate to give her a an equally strong mandate. Germany\u2019s Chancellor Angela Merkel congratulated Emmanuel Macron on his \u201cspectacular\u201d election success today, and has promised to help France tackle unemployment and to work together with him to promote European stability. Merkel told a news conference: He carries the hopes of millions of French people, and of many people in Germany and the whole of Europe. He ran a courageous pro-European campaign, stands for openness to the world and is committed decisively to a social market economy. Franco-German cooperation was a \u201ccornerstone\u201d of German foreign policy, she said, but added that Germany did not need to change its economic course in response to Macron\u2019s election victory. The German government says Macron\u2019s pro-European stance bodes well for future Franco-German cooperation. Speaking in Harrow, north west London, this morning, Theresa May noted that Macron had been elected with a strong mandate - indicating that she needed an equally strong mandate to sit opposite him and his European colleagues during Brexit negotiations. The prime minister, speaking in front of signs that said \u2018Theresa May\u2019s Team\u2019 told Tory activists: Yesterday a new French president was elected. He was elected with a strong mandate which he can take as as strong position into the negotiations. The UK we need to ensue we have an equally strong mandate and an equally strong negotiating position. May said \u201cevery vote for me and my team will strengthen my hand in those Brexit negotiations\u201d. May said voting for Corbyn was a \u201crisk\u201d. She said: Try to picture him at that negotiating table with the collective might of the European Commission and 27 other EU countries against him. In a phone call with Macron, May \u201cbriefly\u201d discussed Brexit and the prime minister \u201creiterated that the UK wants a strong partnership\u201d, Downing Street said. The hackers behind a \u201cmassive and coordinated\u201d attack on the campaign of France\u2019s president-elect, Emmanuel Macron, have been linked by a number of cybersecurity research firms to the same Russian-affiliated group blamed for attacking the Democratic party shortly before the US election, reports my colleague Alex Herne. Tens of thousands of internal emails and other documents were released online overnight on Friday as the midnight deadline to halt campaigning in the French election passed. New York\u2019s Flashpoint Intelligence and Tokyo-based Trend Micro have shared intelligence that suggests that the hacking group known variously as Advanced Persistent Threat 28, Fancy Bear and Pawn Storm was responsible. The group has been liked with the GRU, the Russian military intelligence directorate. Fran\u00e7ois Hollande has spoken to France 2 about the election of Emmanuel Macron, and why he wanted to stand alongside him today. This year I wanted Emmanuel Macron to be here with me, at my side, so that the flame could be passed to him. He told France 2 that he didn\u2019t want to \u201ccapture\u201d Macon: It is the French people who have chosen him. It\u2019s true that he followed me these last few years. But afterwards, he freed himself, he wanted to propose his [own] project to the French people. He is the president and it\u2019s up to him now, bolstered by the experience he had with me, to continue on his path. I wish him every success. And he knows that if he has any need for some information, advice if he asks me, I will always be at his side. Hollande said he would stand down on Sunday, when Macron will officially become the new president. On Monday, I will be a citizen of France and I will be attentive to the situation of my country and I will be ready to help with any requests people ask of me. He gave his successor some advice: He must love the French, all of them, without exception and think that they can be tempted by solutions that are not good. He must soothe as much as possible, but above all protect.. Hollande said he felt emotional to be at the commemorations with Macron. I feel a lot of emotion to be in this place. And then, to speak honestly, to show Emmanuel Macron the path to take. Assistant editor of Le Figaro Samuel Potier calls Hollande\u2019s promise to always be at Macron\u2019s side a \u201ca poisoned chalice\u201d Theresa May has signalled that she will fight any attempts by Macron to renegotiate the border deal between the UK and France that allows British police to operate in Calais. Last month Macron said the Le Touquet border deal must be \u201crenegotiated\u201d to ensure a better outcome for child migrants. Asked about Macron\u2019s threat at an election rally in Harrow on Monday, May said: \u201cThe Le Touquet agreement actually works for the benefit of both the UK and France.\u201d She said she would remind Macron\u2019s team of the mutual benefit of the agreement when she meets his government team. \u201cWe will be sitting down and talking to Monsieur Macron and others about how that system has worked both for the benefit of France as well as for the benefit of the UK,\u201d May said. The British prime minister also crowbarred in her electoral slogan about the need for strong leadership in her response to Macron\u2019s win. She said: \u201cYesterday a new French president was elected. He was elected with a strong mandate which he can take as a strong position in the negotiations. In the UK we need to ensure that we\u2019ve got an equally strong mandate and equally strong negotiating position. Every vote for me and my team will strengthen my hand in those Brexit negotiations.\u201d Guardian-reading Macron voters share their reactions to Macron\u2019s win, and their hopes for the future of France. Hugo T\u00e9tu, 27, unemployed, Paris In the first round I voted for Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, but I didn\u2019t like the way he didn\u2019t support [Macron]. I felt a kind of responsibility toward all the people in France and elsewhere who couldn\u2019t vote, and wanted to. Terrorism, unemployment and mistrust are the most pressing issues facing France. This will be fixed by coping with the economy, public life which he wants to moralise. Mich\u00e8le, 65, writer, Dr\u00f4me I\u2019m ecstatic. I feel as if my life has been saved. I feel that Europe has been saved. The thought of a fascist president was too much to contemplate, especially after Brexit. The EU might really not have survived a Frexit. I think his centrist approach, niether right nor left, is the only way forward from this right left divide which means nothing ever gets done anywhere. He\u2019s inspiring. And he believes in the EU, as I do. I would have voted for whoever stood against Le Pen, but I voted for Macron out of total conviction. Vincent, 24, law student, Rennes I voted for Macron without hesitation. I would have been happy to vote for Macron, if he was clear in the policies that he wants to lead. [...] Our most important problems are all about economy, poverty, and the most marginalised parts of our population that are struggling with no end in sight. This explains the votes for the Front National in the north. This is interesting - the number one reason Macron voters gave for backing their candidate was \u201cFrance\u2019s image abroad\u201d. In second they valued honesty and in third \u201cnew ideas\u201d. A little insight, thanks to the Figaro sport department, on Macron\u2019s love of the beautiful game and sport more generally. Macron is a graduate of the French Federation of Football, when he was a student at L\u2019ENA, Macron is a lifelong Marseille fan. Apparently he also plays tennis, runs and goes skiing. Here is is playing football with some young fans: He has described Paris\u2019 bid to host the 2024 Olympic Games as a \u201cboon for the economy\u201d. Nicolas Sarkozy has congratulated Macron for \u201cthis beautiful election\u201d and said he wished \u201cthe best for France, from the bottom of my heart\u201d. Questioned on France 2, at the VE day commemorations the former president said: I must first congratulate president Macron for this beautiful election and wish from the bottom of my heart the best for France. When you love your country, you can\u2019t but wish the best for him. I know from experience that now the difficult [work] begins. After all the votes have been counted, the official breakdown of votes in the second round of the 2017 French presidential election are in: Macron took 66.1% of the vote; Le Pen took 33.9%. Macron has arrived for a ceremony at the Arc de Triomphe for the French 1945 armistice VE day commemorations this morning. He will stand alongside Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, in what as seen as a symbolic handing over of power from one president to the next. Macron has got around to changing his Twitter profile bio: For the French speakers among you this is a good round-up video of last night\u2019s key moments from Le Monde (and if you don\u2019t speak French, it\u2019s relatively easy to follow). Some key figures from the video: Macron took 66.06% of the vote, the second highest score in the second round of a presidential vote since 1965. But that pales in comparison with the highest figure: Jacques Chirac beat Marine Le Pen\u2019s father in the 2002 second round with 82.21%. But three other statistics indicate that Macron\u2019s political journey may be fraught with danger. More people abstained in this election than at any time since 1969, with 25.4% of the population choosing not to vote. Meanwhile 11.5% of voters spoiled their ballot - the highest recorded figure in the 5th republic. Marine Le Pen got 10.5m vote, more than twice the number her father achieved in 2002. Russian President Vladimir Putin has congratulated Macron on his victory and wished him \u201cstrong health\u201d for the job ahead, the Kremlin announced today (in Russian here). In a telegram Putin told the new president that Russia is ready for constructive work on bilateral and global issues. He urged Macron to \u201covercome mutual distrust\u201d and join forces. He said: The citizens of France have entrusted you the leadership of the country at a difficult time for Europe and for the entire international community. Putin added that the growing threat of terrorism and the destabilisation of entire regions, made it \u201cparticularly important to overcome mutual distrust and unite efforts to ensure international stability and security.\u201d Macron\u2019s chief economics adviser Jean Pisani-Ferry has offered a conciliatory message to Britain, saying the new president will not punish Britain for its decision to leave the EU. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme Pisani-Ferry said a hard Brexit that completely severs ties between Britain and the rest of the European Union is in no one\u2019s interest, and called for security and economic ties to be maintained. France 24 have interviewed Le Pen aide Jean Messiha about the challenges facing the National Front party. Of course it\u2019s a defeat, of course we are a little bit disappointed by the result but if we take the good aspect of this [..] we are at a historic level of voters - almost 11mm people voted for Marine Le Pen. As Le Pen was pictured dancing \u201cLe Rock\u201d following the result - it seems fairly safe to say she doesn\u2019t see the result as a crushing defeat. (Or she might just love \u201crock n roll\u201d dancing like every other French person ever). The Euro has rallied to a six-month high after Macron\u2019s victory last night: This from AFP: The euro rallied to a six-month high against the dollar in early Asia-Pacific forex trading Monday after pro-European centrist Emmanuel Macron won the French presidency in a resounding victory over far-right rival Marine Le Pen. The single currency reached $1.1023, its highest level since November, from $1.0998 on Friday but the gains were modest compared to the reaction following his first round victory last month with markets largely pricing in Le Pen\u2019s defeat. To find out more about Emmanuel Macron in just three minutes, here is our essential primer: Speculation is rife this morning about who new French president Macron will choose as his prime minister. As a relative unknown, some have suggested that a high-profile name is in the offing, in order to boost support for Macron\u2019s fledgling party En Marche! in the French legislative elections in June. As Macron promised he would appoint more women to office if he was elected, and hinted he may appoint a female prime minster. There has been speculation that overtures could be made to International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde - one of France\u2019s best known faces. \u201cSelecting Lagarde as prime minister would be smart,\u201d Laure Mandeville, veteran political reporter for the French publication Le Figaro and best-selling author, told Newsmax, \u201cAnd it would bring lots of voters to his camp for the parliamentary election.\u201d Other potential candidates include Sylvie Goulard, a member of the European Parliament from the centrist Democratic movement, and Anne-Marie Idrac, former secretary of state for transport in outgoing Socialist President Francois Hollande\u2019s cabinet. Jean-Yves LeDrian, defense minister in the Hollande government, and Lyon Mayor Gerard Collombe, another Socialist are said to be in the running. Macron said on Friday he had decided who would be his prime minister if he won Sunday\u2019s vote - but the name was only \u201cin his head\u201d. But as Angelique has tweeted: Macon has said he will not announce his prime minster until he officially becomes president next Sunday. If you are coming fresh to our coverage of the French election then our main story by Paris correspondent Angelique Chrisafis is an excellent place to start: The pro-EU centrist Emmanuel Macron has won the French presidency in a decisive victory over the far-right Front National leader, Marine Le Pen, and vowed to unite a divided and fractured France. Macron, 39, a former economy minister who ran as a \u201cneither left nor right\u201d independent promising to shake up the French political system, took 65.1% to Le Pen\u2019s 34.9%, according to initial projections from early counts. His victory was hailed by his supporters as holding back a tide of populism after the Brexit vote and Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the US election. Addressing thousands of supporters in the grand courtyard of the Louvre, the vast Paris palace-turned-museum, Macron said he would defend France and Europe. He said Europe and the world are \u201cwatching us\u201d and \u201cwaiting for us to defend the spirit of the Enlightenment, threatened in so many places\u201d. He promised to unite a divided and fractured France, saying: \u201cI will do everything to make sure you never have reason again to vote for extremes.\u201d Speaking of his meteoric rise and victory that was not forecast even a year ago, he said: \u201cEveryone said it was impossible. But they didn\u2019t know France!\u201d Good morning and welcome to our second day of live coverage of the French presidential election. Here is what we know so far this morning: \u2022 Independent centrist Emmanuel Macron, 39, who was unknown three years ago, has become France\u2019s youngest-ever president after a 66% to 34% victory in the second round run-off against the far-right Front National\u2019s Marine Le Pen. \u2022 The resounding win has been hailed by his supporters as holding back a tide of populism after the Brexit vote and Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the US election. \u2022 In Macron\u2019s fairly subdued victory speech the political outsider vowed to unite a divided and fractured France, saying the world was watching and \u201cwaiting for us to defend the spirit of the Enlightenment, threatened in so many places\u201d. \u2022 Despite her loss, Le Pen\u2019s score marked a historical high point for the French right. In a defiant concession speech, Le Pen said she was leader of \u201cthe biggest opposition force\u201d in France and vowed to radically overhaul her party. \u2022 With 99.99% of ballots counted early on Monday, Macron had 66.06% of the vote, and Le Pen 33.94%. Turnout was 74.62% \u2013 the lowest in 40 years. \u2022 Macron now faces the challenge of trying to win a parliamentary majority for his fledgling political movement En Marche! in legislative elections next month. Without a majority, he will not be able to carry out his manifesto promises. \u2022 World leaders including Trump, Theresa May and Justin Trudeau have congratulated Macron. \u2022 The British prime minister spoke to Macron in a brief call in which the pair discussed Brexit. Macron also had a \u201cwarm\u201d conversation with German chancellor Angela Merkel. \u2022 Financial markets have been muted in response to Macron\u2019s victory, the Euro remaining fairly flat in early Asian trading.",

          "bodyText": "World leaders have congratulated Emmanuel Macron on his convincing win in the French presidential election as EU capitals expressed relief that France had proven not to be the next domino to fall after Britain\u2019s Brexit vote and Donald Trump\u2019s election as US president. Angela Merkel described Macron\u2019s victory as spectacular and promised to work with him to promote European stability. \u201cHe carries the hopes of millions of French people, and of many people in Germany and the whole of Europe,\u201d the German chancellor told a press conference on Monday. \u201cHe ran a courageous pro-European campaign, stands for openness to the world and is committed decisively to a social market economy.\u201d Merkel\u2019s chief of staff, Peter Altmaier, wrote on Twitter: \u201cVive la France, Vive L\u2019Europe!\u201d, adding that Macron\u2019s win was a \u201ca strong signal for our common values\u201d. The German foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel celebrated Macron\u2019s win for keeping France \u201cat the heart of Europe\u201d. The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, tweeted his congratulations, saying: \u201cHappy that the French have chosen a European future. Together for a stronger and fairer Europe.\u201d The European council president, Donald Tusk, also offered his congratulations, saying the French had chosen \u201cliberty, equality and fraternity\u201d and \u201csaid no to the tyranny of fake news\u201d. Although Marine Le Pen doubled her father\u2019s score from 2002, it was clearly satisfying to many leaders that the far right appeared unable to get above the 40% mark, which some feared would be breached. Minutes after the exit poll predicting Macron\u2019s came out, Downing Street issued a statement expressing British prime minister Theresa May\u2019s optimism over future relations between the two countries. \u201cThe prime minister warmly congratulates president-elect Macron on his election success,\u201d the statement said. \u201cFrance is one of our closest allies and we look forward to working with the new president on a wide range of shared priorities.\u201d A congratulatory statement on Monday from the Kremlin, which had been widely seen as backing Le Pen and gave her a meeting with Vladimir Putin in March, urged Macron to work with Russia to \u201covercome mutual mistrust and unite to ensure international stability and security.\u201d Ties between Russia and France are strained over the wars in Ukraine and Syria while alleged cyberattacks on Macron\u2019s campaign were linked to Moscow. Trump also extended his congratulations, despite earlier having backed Le Pen. Chinese President Xi Jinping congratulated the victor, saying China and France shared a \u201cresponsibility toward peace and development in the world.\u201d \u201cChina stands ready to work with France to move the strategic Sino-French partnership to a higher level,\u201d he said according to Xinhua news agency. Meanwhile, the Chinese daily Global Times, a Communist party controlled tabloid, hailed Macron\u2019s victory as a win against a \u201cpopulism trend\u201d following US President Donald Trump\u2019s election last year. \u201cIt may be too early to conclude that today\u2019s peak of popularism in world politics is beginning to wane,\u201d the nationalist newspaper said. \u201cYears later when we look back upon this election, we may find that France made a wise choice for human civilisation in helping to keep it moving forward at such a crucial time, rather than setting it back,\u201d it said. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said \u201cthe victory of President-elect Macron is a symbolic victory against inward-looking and protectionist moves and shows a vote of confidence in the EU\u201d. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau telephoned Emmanuel Macron to congratulate him. \u201cI look forward to working closely with President-elect Macron in the years ahead as we work together on a progressive agenda to promote international security, increase collaboration in science and technology, and create good, middle class jobs on both sides of the Atlantic,\u201d he said in a statement earlier. Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said he had congratulated Macron and had received a text back saying he was \u201clooking forward to working together\u201d. Highlighting the cooperation between French and Australian soldiers during World War I, he added: \u201cWe have been side-by-side in freedom\u2019s cause for over a century, and we are side-by-side in freedom\u2019s cause in the Middle East today. So we have great work to do to make the ties between France and Australia stronger still.\u201d In Brussels there had been no contingency planning for a Le Pen victory, in a sign of an unwillingness to even consider the ramifications of such a result more than anything else. The election was seen as significantly more important to the survival of the European project than the vote in the UK last June, given the centrality of France, a founding member, to the EU. Le Pen had pledged to take France out of the eurozone and to hold a referendum on France\u2019s EU membership, unless the bloc agreed to revert to a loose coalition of nations with neither a single currency nor a border-free area. Not only did the result come as a significant relief for the European commission, but it will be seen by some in Brussels as a vindication of the EU executive\u2019s unprecedented backing for a candidate in a domestic election. The decision to not comment during the Brexit referendum in the UK, and the question of whether that had been the right way forward, had weighed heavily on officials\u2019 minds in Brussels.",

My heart wanted [the Socialist party\u2019s] Beno\u00eet Hamon, but I had to vote for Macron in order to stop Le Pen getting too many votes.</p> \n  <p>I do not think Macron will be good for the country. My only hope is that he will try to make Europe more socially democratic. France has a high level of unemployment, which has to be tackled as a priority. But we have to stop the extreme right gaining power or France and the EU will be doomed.</p> \n  <p><strong>Peter, 70, Paris: </strong>I\u2019m voting Macron, although I do not support him, but could not tolerate the possibility of a Front National candidate winning.

          "bodyText": "The latest from the French interior ministry puts Macron at 66.06%, with virtually all votes counted. And that is where we are going to leave the live blog. Thanks for reading. For a full wrap of the events in France, have a look at this news story by Paris correspondent Angelique Chrisafis. My colleagues in London will start a new blog of reaction to the results in France as the continent wakes up. Until then, you can all read about Emmanuel Macron\u2019s historic win here. Bonne nuit. Independent centrist Emmanuel Macron, 39, who was unknown three years ago ago, has become France\u2019s youngest-ever president after an estimated 65% to 35% victory in the second round run-off against Front National\u2019s right-wing leader Marine Le Pen. The resounding win has been hailed by his supporters as holding back a tide of populism after the Brexit vote and Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the US election. In Macron\u2019s fairly subdued victory speech the political outsider vowed to unite a divided and fractured France, saying the world was watching and \u201cwaiting for us to defend the spirit of the Enlightenment, threatened in so many places\u201d. Despite her loss, Le Pen\u2019s score marked a historical high point for the French right. In a defiant concession speech, Le Pen said she was leader of \u201cthe biggest opposition force\u201d in France and vowed to radically overhaul her party. Turnout for the vote was the lowest in 40 years. Macron now faces the challenge of trying to win a parliamentary majority for his fledgling political movement En Marche! in legislative elections next month. Without a majority, he will not be able to carry out his manifesto promises. World leaders including Trump, Theresa May and Justin Trudeau have congratulated Macron. The British prime minister spoke to Macron in a brief call in which the pair discussed Brexit. Macron also had a \u201cwarm\u201d conversation with German chancellor Angela Merkel. Financial markets have been muted in response to Macron\u2019s victory, the Euro remaining fairly flat in early Asian trading. The reverberations of the result in France are being felt as far away as Australia, where prime minister Malcolm Turnbull tweeted his congratulations to Macron. He was followed by former PM Kevin Rudd, who described the win as \u201ca smack in the mouth for to racists everywhere\u201d. While Donald Trump has been quick to congratulate Macron, it is worth noting that last month he said Le Pen was the \u201cstrongest candidate\u201d. Just two weeks ago he reaffirmed his support for her on Twitter. Le Pen also found a friend in Steve King, the Republican congressman from Iowa with a history of inflammatory comments on immigration and vocal support for the European far right. So, who is Emmanuel Macron? At this point it is worth revisiting this profile by Angelique Chrisafis, our Paris correspondent, that delves into the back story of the centrist maverick. As well as speaking to Theresa May, Macron has also talked to German chancellor Angela Merkel in the hours following his victory. Macron reportedly had a 10-minute phone conversation with Merkel, telling her that he would travel to Berlin \u201cvery quickly,\u201d a source close to him said, describing it as a \u201cvery warm\u201d exchange. With Macron\u2019s elevation to the Elys\u00e9e Palace in the bag, thoughts will now turn to the make-up of his cabinet and the role his wife Brigitte might play in it. In April, Angelique Chrisafis wrote that if elected, Macron planned to hold a consultation to define the ambiguous status of first lady in France and draw up a job description for the first time. The story also charts the relationship between the pair, which famously began when Macron was a teenage school student and the woman who would become his wife was a drama teacher. Our results tracker neatly shows how each department in France voted. The financial markets aren\u2019t completely convinced about Macron\u2019s victory so the euro remains fairly flat in early Asian trading despite its little bounce earlier. The single currency, which would be expected to benefit from the pro-EU Macron taking charge in France, is down slightly on those ealier gains at US$1.099. It\u2019s up against the yen though, and also the pound which is currently worth \u20ac1.179. Chris Weston of IG Markets in Melbourne has this: \u201cMacron has no traditional party behind him, so the political analysts will be keen to understand the make-up of his government (when it is formed) and one suspects that the view that this potentially fragmented structure is keeping a lid on euro buying. Of course, the fact that this was highly anticipated is the main reason why we are only seeing euro [up slightly] in early Asia trade. However, it could be that with big gains already having been priced in thanks to Macron\u2019s first round win, the euro is set for a fall. An alternative take here at the Market History blog. Here are some more front pages. First up, the Guardian: Meanwhile, The Metro couldn\u2019t resist a pun. Reuters reports that France\u2019s biggest trade unions has issued warnings over the victory of Emmanuel Macron in the country\u2019s presidential election, with one union calling for a demonstration on 8 May. The CFDT, France\u2019s biggest union, welcomed Macron\u2019s victory in a statement but added that the National Front\u2019s score was still too high. \u201cNow, all the anxieties expressed at the ballot by a part of the electorate must be heard. The feeling of being disenfranchised, of injustice, and even abandonment is present among a large number of our citizens. The CFDT calls on Emmanuel Macron not to turn a deaf ear to this despair,\u201d it said. The CGT, one of the country\u2019s more militant unions, called for a demonstration in Paris on 8 May to mark the start of Macron\u2019s presidency in protest against \u201cliberal\u201d economic policies. British Brexit supporters have poured scorn on France and Emmanuel Macron after his victory, writes Tim Wyatt in the Guardian. The Twitter account of Leave.EU, the pro-Brexit pressure group set up by Nigel Farage for last year\u2019s referendum, tweeted that the French people had once again \u201crolled over\u201d just as they had done in 1940 \u2013 except this time they saved Germany \u201cthe bullets and the fuel\u201d. The tweet also included a picture of a newspaper headline from 1940 reporting the surrender of France to the Nazis. You can read more here: Theresa May has already spoken to Macron about Brexit, according to Number 10. A readout of the first call between the French president-elect and the British prime minister said May called Macron \u201cto warmly congratulate him on his election victory.\u201d \u201cThe Prime Minister said that she looked forward to working with the new President on a range of shared issues, with the UK and France\u2019s unique partnership providing a strong foundation for future co-operation,\u201d it said. \u201cThe leaders briefly discussed Brexit and the Prime Minister reiterated that the UK wants a strong partnership with a secure and prosperous EU once we leave.\u201cThe Prime Minister and President-elect Macron looked forward to meeting and holding discussions at the upcoming NATO and G7 Summits.\u201d An early edition front page of Lib\u00e9ration, the left-leaning French newspaper jointly founded by the late philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, simply declares \u201cWell played,\u201d alongside a portrait of Macron. More reaction from leaders around the world has been rolling in. Canada\u2019s prime minister Justin Trudeau tweeted his congratulations and also put out a statement lauding the \u201cwarm and historic relationship\u201d between France and Canada. Irish Taoiseach Enda Kenny also sent his congratulations. Sweden\u2019s prime minister, Stefan Lofven, said Macron\u2019s win was \u201ca victory for the French people and for European cooperation.\u201d \u201cNew opportunities will now open up for the proactive agenda needed to strengthen the EU, including more jobs and fair working conditions, a stronger climate policy and a functioning asylum system in which everyone takes responsibility,\u201d he said. Thanks Jon. Bonnie Malkin here taking over the blog for the coming hours. First, a look at how the news of Macron\u2019s victory has been received by some of the British press. The Telegraph\u2019s front page sees the win purely through the lens of Brexit, rather than the defeat of a far-right candidate. There is no mention of the results in France on the front of the Daily Mail, which, if you remember, made quite a big deal of Le Pen\u2019s arrival in the second round. The Times, meanwhile, played it pretty straight. That\u2019s about it from me; I\u2019m going to hand the blog over to my colleague Bonnie Malkin now. Thanks for following \u2013 all things considered, this has been a satisfyingly remarkable conclusion to a fairly astonishing election. Two years ago, few had heard of Emmanuel Macron. Tonight he becomes France\u2019s youngest president, its first avowed centrist leader, and the country\u2019s first head of state to be elected without the support of an established party. Over to Bonnie. Here are the opening paragraphs of Angelique Chrisafis\u2019s news story on Macron\u2019s historic win, which is the Guardian\u2019s front page splash: The pro-EU centrist Emmanuel Macron has won the French presidency in a decisive victory over the far-right Front National leader, Marine Le Pen, and vowed to unite a divided and fractured France. Macron, 39, a former economy minister who ran as a \u201cneither left nor right\u201d independent promising to shake up the French political system, took 65.1% to Le Pen\u2019s 34.9%, according to initial projections from early counts. His victory was hailed by his supporters as holding back a tide of populism after the Brexit vote and Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the US election. In a solemn first speech from his campaign headquarters, he vowed to \u201cdefend France and Europe\u201d. He promised to \u201cunite\u201d a divided and fractured France that had led people to vote for \u201cextremes\u201d. He said that he would \u201cfight with all my strength against the division that undermines and destroys us\u201d. Despite the wide margin of the final result, Le Pen\u2019s score nonetheless marked a historic high for the French far right. You can read Angelique\u2019s full piece here. A rather pointed tweet from Hillary Clinton, the Democratic candidate in last year\u2019s US presidential election, who recently said foreign hacking of officials close to her campaign may have contributed to her defeat. Macron\u2019s En Marche! movement said on Friday night it had been the target of a \u201cmassive and coordinated\u201d hacking attack that led to an online dump of tens of thousands of emails and other documents. Here is video footage of Le Pen\u2019s speech in which she conceded defeat to Macron earlier this evening but hailed a \u201chistoric\u201d score for the Front National and promised to \u201ctransform\u201d the party \u2013 which most people are taking to mean renaming it \u2013 to become the \u201cmain force of opposition\u201d to Macron: Macron won in every age group, according to Ipsos: Macron\u2019s choice of Beethoven\u2019s Ode to Joy as the background music to his march to the stage was surely significant. It has been used before: Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, France\u2019s Socialist president from 1981 to 1995, chose it for his first victory celebration. But the Ode to Joy, a musical setting of Schiller\u2019s lyrical verse of the same name, is also the anthem of the European Union \u2013 an expression, the EU says, of Schiller\u2019s vision of \u201cthe human race becoming brothers\u201d. EU leaders adopted it as the bloc\u2019s anthem in 1985 and it is played at official ceremonies involving the EU \u201cto celebrate the values member states share\u201d rather than to replace their own national anthems. Macron campaigned on a strong pro-European platform and explicitly said in his victory speech that \u201cstrengthening the European Union\u201d was one of his goals as president. The first foreign leader to speak to him was Angela Merkel. The president elect has often said his first priority in Brexit talks would be to \u201cdefend the integrity\u201d of the EU. In his election manifesto he described Brexit as a \u201ccrime\u201d that will leave the UK facing \u201cservitude\u201d. His choice of music tonight would seem to send a particularly strong message to Theresa May. The task facing us is immense, says Macron, and will start tomorrow. It involves reinforcing France\u2019s economy, building new defences, ensuring the safety of all French citizens. It is a huge job and it will require more of the same audacity that has brought us this far. This task will require the involvement and commitment of everyone, he says. It will require the courage of truth. It will require the building of a real and strong majority, a majority for change that the country needs and deserves. We have the strength and the energy. We will not give in to fear, to division, to lies, to a love of decline or defeat. I know what I owe you, to my companions, my family, my friends. It will not be easy. The job wil be difficult. I will tell you the truth but your fervour and your courage will carry me forward. I want the unity of our people and of our country. And finally, I will serve you with humility, with force, and in the name of our motto: liberty, equality and fraternity. I will serve you with love, he says. Vive la R\u00e9publique, vive la France. His wife Brigitte joins him on stage, on the verge of tears, with her children and grandchildren. Emmanuel Macron is about to speak to the cheering crowds in front of the Louvre, to the strains of Beethoven\u2019s Ode to Joy, the European anthem. Thank you my friends, he says. Thank you for being here this evening. Thank you for having fought with such courage for so many months because this evening you have won, France has won. What has been accomplished has no precedent or equivalent, he says. People said it was impossible. Thank you for the efforts, and the risks some people took. I take full measure of the honour. He says he is aware he has not been given a blank cheque by those who voted for him simply to keep out the extremist parties. He says he will stand by his engagement to protect France. He says of those who voted for Le Pen that he understands their fear and their anger and will do all he can to ensure during the next five years that they have no further reason to vote for the extremists. This evening, he says, it is Europe and the world who are watching us. Here\u2019s Leave.EU\u2019s take on the evening\u2019s proceedings, offered without comment: Lib\u00e9ration has some fun facts on France\u2019s new president, in case you were feeling this this was all getting a bit heavy. They include: He\u2019s the first French president to be called Emmanuel. His name is only worth nine Scrabble points, the lowest tally of any president of the Fifth Republic and way fewer than Sarkozy (34). He is 1.73 metres tall, six centimetres less than the French average and one centimetre less than Marine Le Pen. He likes Johnny Halliday and Charles Aznavour, and once said wine was \u201cthe soul of France\u201d. His dog, a Dogo Argentino, is called Figaro. In Nevers, Oscar Lopez has found a mixture of relief and disappointment at the result. \u201cIt\u2019s so great,\u201d said Catherine Fleurier, 53, a social assistant on the city council, who, like Macron, was elected without party affiliation. \u201cOtherwise we would\u2019ve had to become exiles from our own country. The revolution would start tomorrow.\u201d Others were less enthusiastic. \u201cI wasn\u2019t even going to vote today,\u201d said Bourak Patrouche, 66, a local bartender. \u201cBut I had to. Just to avoid the political catastrophe that would have been the Front National.\u201d An Algerian immigrant who came to France in the 60s, Patrouche was incensed by Marine Le Pen\u2019s anti-immigrant discourse. \u201cFrance is a land of welcome,\u201d he said. \u201cHer project was just based on fear and racism \u2013 it was completely unrealisable.\u201d Still, Patrouche, who had voted for the hard left Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon in the first round, wasn\u2019t particularly enthused by Macron. \u201cWhen you come from the world of work, you can\u2019t accept a man like that,\u201d he said. \u201cM\u00e9lenchon wanted to fight the bourgeoisie \u2013 Macron is the bourgeoisie.\u201d Joffrey Drapeau, 27, had also voted M\u00e9lenchon in the first round. \u201cI\u2019m very worried for the future,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is a victory for Macron: 35%, that\u2019s a big score for Marine Le Pen. That\u2019s a victory for fear.\u201d Though he\u2019d voted for Macron himself, he was very disappointed with the campaign: \u201cThere was no candidate who was truly presidential,\u201d he said. \u201cFrance\u2019s political system is far from its people: That\u2019s why so many people vote for the FN.\u201d For Leila Sabri, 49, her vote for Macron had been an act of resistance. \u201cI wanted to show Marine Le Pen that I can be Muslim and French at the same time,\u201d she said. \u201cMy religion is a part of me. But France is my country.\u201d Still, Sabri was so anxious about the result, she hadn\u2019t slept the night before, and the results hadn\u2019t eased her worries completely. \u201cFive years goes quickly,\u201d she said. \u201cIf this doesn\u2019t work out, we\u2019ll have Marine as president, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d The Guardian has a live results tracker running that shows the count by department and the percentage change between the first and second rounds, as well as the abstention figure. You can have a look at it here. Marion Mar\u00e9chal Le Pen, Marine\u2019s niece and one of the Front National\u2019s only two MPs, acknowledged \u201csome disappointment\u201d after Macron\u2019s victory and called for a period of \u201creflection\u201d on the party\u2019s campaign strategy. The FN\u2019s fight must be aimed at ensuring Macron does not have his hands completely free to run the country. There needs to be as many as possible of us in the national assembly. Some interesting numbers from Mathieu Gallard of pollsters Ipsos: About 43% of Macron\u2019s voters cast their ballot for him to keep out Le Pen; only 39% of voters would like the new president to have an absolute majority in the new parliament after legislative elections next month; taking into account abstentions and spoiled ballots, roughly 44% of people on the electoral roll voted for Macron \u2013 similar to De Gaulle in 1965 (45%), Mitterrand in 1981 (43%) and 1988 (44%) and Sarkozy in 2007 (43%). The parliamentary majority figure shows how hard the new president is going to have to work to get his programme implemented. The euro has hit a six-month high against the US dollar as financial traders react to the French election results. The single currency rose to $1.102 in early trading, its strongest position since the US elections last November. Investors are relieved that Emmanuel Macron\u2019s victory removes question marks over France\u2019s membership of the EU, and the single currency. But it\u2019s a fairly modest rise, as Macron\u2019s victory was largely \u2018priced-in\u2019. The euro has also hit a one-year high against the yen - a sign of relief that Macron secured such a big win over Marine Le Pen. It\u2019s up 0.3% against the pound too, to 84.9p. Michiel de Bruin, head of global rates and money markets at BMO Global Asset Management, comments: \u201cThis win sends a clear signal that anti-EU populist parties are unable to secure a power base across the political landscape in continental Europe. This started with the presidential elections in Austria in December 2016, with a win by the Pro-European Alexander Van der Bellen, followed by the Dutch elections last March where centrist pro-European parties won the elections. Now this trend has been echoed in France with a win by Emmanuel Macron, who has been campaigning on a pro-European agenda.\u201d Timothy Graf, head of macro strategy at State Street Global Markets, predicts that markets can now relax about European politics. But possibly not for long. Graf says: We expect the focus to now shift to how successful Macron\u2019s political movement, and new party, En Marche!, will poll ahead of June\u2019s parliamentary elections, and how strong a coalition of support he can expect as the leader of what is likely to be a minority party.\u201d US president Donald Trump, who before the first round vote last month had said that Marine Le Pen was \u201cthe strongest\u201d candidate, has tweeted his congratulations to Macron: Emmanuel Macron has given his victory speech. It was sober, calm and short. He spoke of a \u201cbig honour, and an immense responsibility\u201d. He said he was speaking to all of France\u2019s citizens, not just those who voted for him. He sent \u201crepublican greetings\u201d to Marine Le Pen. He said he was aware of the \u201canger, anxiety and doubt\u201d that many French citizens feel and had expressed in their vote. He said he would be \u201cimplacable and entirely resolved\u201d in defending their security. I will defend France, its vital interests, its image. His primary task over the coming five years, he said, was to \u201ccalm people\u2019s fears, restore France\u2019s confidence, and gather all its people together to face the immense challenges that face us in the future\u201d. The abstention rate, an estimated 25.3%, was the highest in a French presidential election since 1969, and the number of voters who cast a blank or spoiled ballot is expected to reach an absolute record of about 12%. The figures reflect the relatively large number of French people in this election who felt unable to vote for either candidate so either did not do so, or did but registered their disapproval of the choice they were being offered. Commentators have said this is largely a consequence of the fact that neither candidate represented an established mainstream party, and that for some voters, particularly on the left, the alternative to the far right was seen as significantly more right than left. The outgoing French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, has congratulated his successor, who until less than two years ago was his economy minister. Hollande told reporters he the new president would take office on 14 May. Hollande tweeted: I have called Emmanuel Macron to congratulate him warmly on his election. I have expressed all my best wishes for the success of our country. In his first (and very brief) statement to Agence France-Presse, Emmanuel Macron said: A new chapter in our long history has opened this evening. I would like it to be one of hope and of renewed confidence. Angela Merkel\u2019s spokesman said the German chancellor welcomed Emmanuel Macron\u2019s win as \u201ca victory for a strong united Europe and for Franco-German friendship\u201d. The European council president, Donald Tusk, has also tweeted his congratulations: The French prime minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, said the vote \u201ctestifies to the lucidity of the voters who rejected the deadly project of the extreme right\u201d and showed \u201can embrace of the European Union\u201d. Marine Le Pen has just spoken to her supporters, hailing a \u201chistoric\u201d score for her party and promising to \u201clead the fight\u201d in France\u2019s parliamentary elections next month. She pledged a \u201cprofound transformation\u201d of the Front National to create \u201ca new political force\u201d. It is not immediately clear what she means by this, but commentators are suggesting she aims to disband the party and build a new movement, aiming to organise \u201ca major political reorganisation around the divide between patriots and globalists\u201d: Our patriotic and republican alliance will be the primary force of opposition to the programme of the new president. Florian Philippot, a senior FN figure, has suggested to French media the party, which despite Le Pen\u2019s efforts to detoxify it still carries an image of racism and anti-semitism, will soon be renamed. Theresa May has been quick off the mark, releasing a statement through a Downing Street spokesperson: The prime minister warmly congratulates President-elect Macron on his election success. France is one of our closest allies and we look forward to working with the new president on a wide range of shared priorities. At 39, Macron will become France\u2019s youngest president and has pulled off a remarkable feat. He has never held elected office, and just over a year ago his political movement En Marche! did not even exist. His rival, the far-right leader Marine Le Pen, will certainly see this result as a disappointment. But as my colleague Angelique Chrisafis points out, she has brought her France-first, anti-EU Front National party a long way: The centrist Emmanuel Macron is the next president of France, defeating his far-right rival, Marine Le Pen, by a comfortable 65.1% to 34.9%, according to a usually reliable vote estimate by pollsters Ipsos/Sopra Steria for French state TV and radio and Le Monde. Vote estimates by other polling organisations for different French media show a broadly similar result, although some are showing marginal variations. The abstention rate is estimated at 25.3%, the highest since 1969 but not unexpected for such an unusual election. TV satellite vans are massing outside the Louvre in Paris, where what Macron\u2019s team believe will be his victory celebrations are to be staged. In little over 30 minutes, as the last polling stations close at 8pm, French media will publish their estimates of the final result. They may vary by a percentage point or two, but are generally highly consistent. Unlike the exit polls in many countries, in which people are asked how they voted as they leave the polling station, these estimates \u2013 in use and steadily perfected since 1965 \u2013 are based on a vote count. Pollsters select about 200 early closing polling stations around the country \u2013 in rural areas, small towns and urban agglomerations \u2013 carefully chosen to be as representative as possible of the country as a whole. As soon as those stations have closed at 7pm, and as their votes are being counted, a polling official records, for a sizeable sample of the ballots, the number of votes cast for each candidate. Those numbers are then run through a sophisticated computer program that adjusts them for past results and assorted variables, and produces a national vote estimate. These are not the official result, but they are also not an exit poll. They are also very accurate, usually to within a percentage point. Over the course of the evening, as the interior ministry\u2019s official count advances, it will give different numbers, but that is because the earliest final counts come from rural areas that traditionally favour the right. Gradually, as bigger towns and cities start to declare, the official count and the pollsters\u2019 8pm vote estimate come into alignment. As many polling stations close (some, particularly in big cities, will remain open for another hour), France\u2019s newspaper of record, Le Monde, has announced that it will also boycott the Front National\u2019s election evening event in the Bois de Vincennes. The Front National has chosen to exclude some French and international media from its election evening event on 7 May ... Le Monde forcefully condemns this attitude, which does not allow proper coverage of a major democratic moment and shows a poor interpretation of press freedom. In solidarity with the media concerned, we have decided we will not be present at this election evening event. This decision will not prevent us from covering the Front National to the same journalistic standards. Back in Nevers, Oscar Lopez has been speaking to the town\u2019s mayor and some other Macron supporters in the former Socialist stronghold. Like Macron, Nevers\u2019 mayor, Denis Thuriot, had been part of the Socialist party before running for office as an independent. Elected in 2014, Thuriot ended a 43-year run for the Socialists. \u201cI had to bring people together from the right and the left,\u201d he said. Now, he hopes Macron can do the same: \u201cIt\u2019s a seismic political shift, but it\u2019s necessary. It\u2019s the change that\u2019s best for France.\u201d The En Marche! candidate had certainly convinced Aline, 42. \u201cIt\u2019s been a difficult election,\u201d she said. \u201cFrench people are tired of politics, with the political system.\u201d A lifelong Socialist, she voted for the party\u2019s Beno\u00eet Hamon in the first round, but believes Macron \u201cembodies the values of the left. He has brought people together from all the parties that didn\u2019t make it through to the second round\u201d. J\u00e9r\u00e9mie, 30, also voted for Hamon in the first round. But for the run-off, he was voting more against Le Pen than anything else. \u201cShe promises nothing but destruction,\u201d he says. \u201cIt would be a catastrophe.\u201d Thuriot was equally critical. \u201cIt\u2019s fascism with a different face,\u201d he said of the Front National. \u201cYoung people don\u2019t know its history, they didn\u2019t live through the war. So when they see the country\u2019s difficulties, they see it as an alternative. That\u2019s dangerous.\u201d Macron, he hoped, would bring the country together. \u201cIt\u2019s extraordinary,\u201d he said. \u201cI think French people will find new connections \u2013 between right and left, between each other. That\u2019s the true republican spirit.\u201d Paris prosecutors have opened an investigation into the hacking attack on Emmanuel Macron\u2019s En Marche! campaign that saw about nine gigabytes of data, including tens of thousands of emails and documents, some of them fake, dumped online on Friday night, sources have told French media. The leaked documents seem largely unremarkable, but the national elections commission urged French media and citizens not to republish their contents under strict rules barring any form of electioneering the day before the vote and on election day. Prosecutors have also launched a separate inquiry into whether fake news was being used to influence the voting after Le Pen suggested during the candidates\u2019 live TV debate that former banker Macron may have an offshore account. A list of online and mainly left-leaning media organisations and websites say they have not been accredited for the Front National\u2019s election evening event in the Bois de Vincennes on the eastern edge of Paris. Organisations including BuzzFeed, Politico, Rue89, Mediapart and Les Jours all said they have been refused admittance. The leftwing daily newspaper Lib\u00e9ration has said it will boycott the event in solidarity. If turnout projections of about 74% are correct, it would be the lowest in the second round of a French presidential election since 1969. This is not unexpected in a contest as unique as that between the independent centrist Macron and far-right Le Pen, neither of whom have the formal backing of a mainstream political group, say analysts. Yves-Marie Cann of pollsters Elabe told L\u2019Express that the 1969 election, when the rate of abstention was a record 31.1%, was similarly exceptional, featuring two centre-right candidates: Georges Pompidou and Alain Poher. The perils of polling day: in order not to disturb five baby blue tits born between the two rounds in a nest occupying a disused letterbox in the main front door of the mairie (town hall) of the village of La Lande-Chasles (population 115) near Angers, voters are being asked to use an alternative entrance to the polling station, reports BFMTV. Guardian readers in France and abroad have been answering a request for their views on the election. Carmen Fishwick has responses of some voters who are supporting Macron, but not entirely enthusiastically. Tom, 22, Paris: I want to see Le Pen as far away as possible from the \u00c9lys\u00e9e. I don\u2019t think Macron will be positive in any way for us except to avoid Le Pen, as his policies are still very unclear. I feel very disappointed as there are no left-leaning candidates. It seems embarrassing to me now to choose between the cause or the consequences, as pro-business policies are definitely a springboard for far-right ideas for next elections. Catherine, 56, London: It was very difficult to vote for Macron, who I believe will not be able to govern and minimise the big divisions in France. My heart wanted [the Socialist party\u2019s] Beno\u00eet Hamon, but I had to vote for Macron in order to stop Le Pen getting too many votes. I do not think Macron will be good for the country. My only hope is that he will try to make Europe more socially democratic. France has a high level of unemployment, which has to be tackled as a priority. But we have to stop the extreme right gaining power or France and the EU will be doomed. Peter, 70, Paris: I\u2019m voting Macron, although I do not support him, but could not tolerate the possibility of a Front National candidate winning. I\u2019m not particularly confident that much will change under him, especially as it\u2019s not at all certain he will have a majority support in the parliament. I voted M\u00e9lenchon as he represented most closely those values that I support and was the only left candidate who displayed any genuine passion. As in many countries, there is considerable anxiety for the future, especially around employment, health services provision, youth disenchantment and immigration. The interior ministry has released afternoon turnout figures, showing the abstention rate is noticeably higher than in France\u2019s previous three presidential elections. Turnout at 5pm this year was 65.3%, the ministry said, down from 71.96% at the previous election in 2012, 75.1% in 2005 and 67.62% in 2002. Pollsters estimate that the final abstention rate will be about 25% or 26%, in line with forecasts before the vote. Analysts have said a spectacularly low turnout could in principle boost Le Pen\u2019s score. The \u201cni-ni\u201d (\u201cneither nor\u201d) movement \u2013 voters who say they cannot bring themselves to vote for either candidate \u2013 has been quite vocal during the second round, led by supporters of hard left veteran Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon and conservative Catholics who backed the centre-right candidate, Fran\u00e7ois Fillon. In the Burgundy town of Nevers, 150 miles (240km) south of Paris, long a Socialist party bastion and a stronghold of the late president Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, Oscar Lopez has found voters turning to Le Pen. \u201cI\u2019m not in France anymore,\u201d said Ivette Millerioux, 78, after casting her ballot. \u201cI don\u2019t know where I am.\u201d Millerioux, whose father fought in the second world war, said she was frightened after seeing so many terror attacks in France. \u201cI\u2019ve lived through two wars already,\u201d she says, recalling the Algerian war of independence. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d live through a third. But now, here I am.\u201d Millerioux once supported the Socialists and voted for Mitterrand in 1981. But not any more. \u201cMarine Le Pen, that\u2019s France,\u201d she said. She was particularly concerned by the number of African immigrants arriving in Nevers: \u201cMultiply that by all the cities in France \u2013 it\u2019s unthinkable.\u201d Another former Socialist Karine Bartier said she had voted for the far-left candidate Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon in the first round. \u201cNow I don\u2019t want to vote for either of them,\u201d said the 45-year-old. Still, when faced with the ballot box, she had chosen Front National. \u201cThere are too many immigrants,\u201d she said. \u201cFrance is already in such a difficult position - how are we supposed to welcome more people with such misery? At least with Le Pen, we have a chance at change. Things can\u2019t get any worse anyway.\u201d But for Jean-Philippe Sacquepey, 57, Le Pen represented a much greater destiny for France. \u201cThis republic can\u2019t last,\u201d he says. \u201cWe must return to the monarchy.\u201d For that, there was only one candidate. \u201cThe Le Pen family is descended from Joan of Arc,\u201d Sacquepey insisted. \u201cI voted for Marine \u2013 the heart of Joan of Arc still beats.\u201d Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen voted earlier this morning. The far-right politician cast her ballot in her northern stronghold of H\u00e9nin-Beaumont. The independent centrist Macron voted in the coastal resort of Le Touquet, where he has a second home: Good afternoon and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the runoff round of this tumultuous 2017 French presidential election. Voting has been under way since 8am in France as the country\u2019s 47 million voters choose their next president, the eighth in the Fifth Republic. The last polls close at 8pm and usually reliable estimates of the result will be known almost immediately. The outcome matters not just because France is the world\u2019s sixth biggest economy and a key member of the EU, Nato and the UN security council, but also because the two candidates\u2019 world views could not not be more different. Pollsters have predicted since the first round on 23 April that Emmanuel Macron, a centrist former banker and economy minister, will win comfortably, possibly by more than 20 percentage points, and at 39 become France\u2019s youngest ever leader. He is economically liberal, socially progressive, globally minded and \u2013 on the whole \u2013 optimistic. His rival, Marine Le Pen of the far-right Front National, is a nation-first protectionist who wants to close France\u2019s borders and abandon the euro and EU. Macron wants to ease labour laws, boost education in deprived areas, extend welfare protection to the self-employed and re-energise the EU. Le Pen aims to cut immigration to 10,000 a year, punish outsourcing by multinationals, and eradicate Islamism. The campaign has been extraordinary in many ways: for the first time, a sitting first-term president has not sought re-election, and the two mainstream centre right and centre left parties that have run France since the 1950s are not represented in the runoff. It has been marked by the crashing out of pre-race favourites, a terror attack on the eve of the first round, and \u2013 less than 48 hours before today\u2019s vote \u2013 a massive online data dump of documents hacked from Macron\u2019s En Marche! movement. An unhappy and deeply fractured France \u2013 its east and its north divided from its from west; its graduates from its school-leavers; its thriving, cosmopolitan cities from its left-behind small towns and villages \u2013 will soon know the name of its next leader.",

That is what we found in Canada.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/26/gina-miller-raises-300000-for-candidates-to-oppose-hard-brexit\">Gina Miller raises \u00a3300,000 for candidates to oppose hard Brexit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Miller is looking at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/26/gina-miller-raises-300000-for-candidates-to-oppose-hard-brexit\">supporting candidates in up to 100 marginal constituencies</a>, likely to include swing seats in the north and the south-west where the Liberal Democrats were punished in the 2015 election for their role in the coalition government. </p> <p>The Canadian political landscape has some similarities to the UK\u2019s but also some key differences. Like Britain, Canada has a first-past-the-post voting system. But the previous prime minister, Stephen Harper, had been in power for almost 10 years, arguably creating an appetite for change. In addition, the charismatic Trudeau had led the Liberals for two years and had few of the internal party struggles challenging Corbyn. </p> <p>Strategic Voting Canada intervened after data analysis of the previous general election found that five million progressive votes were \u201cwasted\u201d because they were splintered among three leftist and centrist parties \u2013 the Liberals, the NDP and the Greens.</p> <p>They found that the combined progressive vote of the three parties was enough to have changed the outcome in 57 electoral districts. </p> <p>\u201cOur goal was to pool the progressive voting bloc and get people to vote for the most likely candidate to win in each constituencys, even if wasn\u2019t their first choice candidate,\u201d said Abdel-Rahman.</p> <p>He made recommendations for a candidate in virtually all of the 338 constituencies to help the cause, but ran a targeted campaign for 126 swing seats. \u201cWe lost fewer than five,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The Liberal party won an absolute majority in what Trudeau called a victory for \u201cpositive politics\u201d. One of its biggest breakthroughs was in Qu\u00e9bec, where the Liberals had not been a political force since the days of Trudeau\u2019s father, Pierre.</p> <p>\u201cIt was the Conservative party\u2019s election to lose at the beginning. All the polls showed them clearly ahead. Even two weeks before the election I had supporters telling me they were going to give up because there was no hope. There was no dark horse on the left but what happened was amazing,\u201d said Abdel-Rahman. </p> <p>\u201cWith a direct message that people felt was sincere, the talk about strategic voting began to pick up in the last two or three weeks. I could see the traffic to my website double, triple, quadruple, and people were responding to the message.\u201d</p> <p>Psephologists are not convinced a similar campaign can work in the UK. John Curtice, professor of politics at Strathclyde University, said tactical voting had been happening in Britain since 1987. \u201cTactical voting is already priced into the market,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cYou have voters in Cornwall voting for Liberal Democrats for years who, if they lived in Liverpool, they would vote Labour. There was also tactical voting by Conservative supporters in Lib Dem seats.\u201d</p> <p>Curtice said if the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/22/opinium-observer-poll-conservatives-way-ahead-of-labour\">polls putting Tories on course for a landslide victory</a> proved accurate, tactical voting would not be able to beat the \u201cbrutal arithmetic\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cIf the Tories really are at 47%, all tactical voting is going to do is reduce their share. Tactical voting tends to work against parties that are already down in the polls, it is not going to change the broad picture.\u201d</p> <p>He pointed to the 1997 election when Paddy Ashdown, then leader of the Liberal Democrats, indicated he would work with Labour rather than the Tories. \u201cIt was widely known that Labour would work with the Lib Dems, so there was a pretty strong message out there for those that wanted to vote tactically. </p> <p>\u201cThis time, it you are remainer and want to vote tactically, the question will be if you regard the position as adequate or not. Plus there are quite a few Lib Dems out there who still can\u2019t forgive them for the coalition.\u201d</p> <p>But he agreed that tactical voting could help to mobilise younger voters like those in Canada who came out in droves to support Trudeau. \u201cYoung people don\u2019t come out and vote, period,\u201d said Curtice.</p>",

          "bodyText": "The founder of a strategic voting initiative that helped propel Justin Trudeau\u2019s Liberal party into office in Canada believes Gina Miller\u2019s campaign for tactical voting in the UK election has a \u201cgreat chance\u201d of blunting Theresa May\u2019s bid to consolidate power. Hisham Abdel-Rahman has already been in touch with Miller\u2019s Best for Britain team, which launched its campaign last week with a \u00a3300,000 war chest raised through crowdfunding. \u201cI would absolutely love to be involved and to come to Britain and help Gina. We\u2019ve had one conversation already and I believe if the progressives get their act together they have a great chance,\u201d said Abdel-Rahman, who is an IT consultant and self-confessed \u201cpolitical junkie\u201d. The key to success was to persuade young progressive voters to register and take part in the ballot on 8 June, said Abdel-Rahman, the founder of Strategic Vote Canada, which Miller described as \u201cone of the most successful tactical voting campaigns in the world\u201d. \u201cThe only way you can do this, is to convince them that their vote is going to make a difference,\u201d he said. \u201cMany young voters don\u2019t vote because they don\u2019t think their vote counts, but if you say to them: \u2018We have a plan, vote for this candidate, even if he or she wouldn\u2019t be the candidate of your choice it is better than the Conservatives staying in power,\u2019 they will respond. That is what we found in Canada.\u201d Miller is looking at supporting candidates in up to 100 marginal constituencies, likely to include swing seats in the north and the south-west where the Liberal Democrats were punished in the 2015 election for their role in the coalition government. The Canadian political landscape has some similarities to the UK\u2019s but also some key differences. Like Britain, Canada has a first-past-the-post voting system. But the previous prime minister, Stephen Harper, had been in power for almost 10 years, arguably creating an appetite for change. In addition, the charismatic Trudeau had led the Liberals for two years and had few of the internal party struggles challenging Corbyn. Strategic Voting Canada intervened after data analysis of the previous general election found that five million progressive votes were \u201cwasted\u201d because they were splintered among three leftist and centrist parties \u2013 the Liberals, the NDP and the Greens. They found that the combined progressive vote of the three parties was enough to have changed the outcome in 57 electoral districts. \u201cOur goal was to pool the progressive voting bloc and get people to vote for the most likely candidate to win in each constituencys, even if wasn\u2019t their first choice candidate,\u201d said Abdel-Rahman. He made recommendations for a candidate in virtually all of the 338 constituencies to help the cause, but ran a targeted campaign for 126 swing seats. \u201cWe lost fewer than five,\u201d he said. The Liberal party won an absolute majority in what Trudeau called a victory for \u201cpositive politics\u201d. One of its biggest breakthroughs was in Qu\u00e9bec, where the Liberals had not been a political force since the days of Trudeau\u2019s father, Pierre. \u201cIt was the Conservative party\u2019s election to lose at the beginning. All the polls showed them clearly ahead. Even two weeks before the election I had supporters telling me they were going to give up because there was no hope. There was no dark horse on the left but what happened was amazing,\u201d said Abdel-Rahman. \u201cWith a direct message that people felt was sincere, the talk about strategic voting began to pick up in the last two or three weeks. I could see the traffic to my website double, triple, quadruple, and people were responding to the message.\u201d Psephologists are not convinced a similar campaign can work in the UK. John Curtice, professor of politics at Strathclyde University, said tactical voting had been happening in Britain since 1987. \u201cTactical voting is already priced into the market,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have voters in Cornwall voting for Liberal Democrats for years who, if they lived in Liverpool, they would vote Labour. There was also tactical voting by Conservative supporters in Lib Dem seats.\u201d Curtice said if the polls putting Tories on course for a landslide victory proved accurate, tactical voting would not be able to beat the \u201cbrutal arithmetic\u201d. \u201cIf the Tories really are at 47%, all tactical voting is going to do is reduce their share. Tactical voting tends to work against parties that are already down in the polls, it is not going to change the broad picture.\u201d He pointed to the 1997 election when Paddy Ashdown, then leader of the Liberal Democrats, indicated he would work with Labour rather than the Tories. \u201cIt was widely known that Labour would work with the Lib Dems, so there was a pretty strong message out there for those that wanted to vote tactically. \u201cThis time, it you are remainer and want to vote tactically, the question will be if you regard the position as adequate or not. Plus there are quite a few Lib Dems out there who still can\u2019t forgive them for the coalition.\u201d But he agreed that tactical voting could help to mobilise younger voters like those in Canada who came out in droves to support Trudeau. \u201cYoung people don\u2019t come out and vote, period,\u201d said Curtice.",

The 2m acre Fort Peck Indian reservation straddles this winding water source, providing sustenance for the almost 7,000 Assiniboine and Sioux tribe members here and thousands of others throughout north-east Montana. It is the river that Welch and other Native American activists on the reserve say the Keystone XL oil pipeline \u2013 or the \u201cblack snake\u201d \u2013 will corrupt.</p> \n<p>The river maintains the deer, the fish, the native plants, sweet grasses and sacred sage. \u201cAnything that threatens my way of life and my spiritual well-being, I consider myself at war with,\u201d she says, her two-year-old daughter by her side. \u201cI will do whatever it takes.\u201d</p> \n<p>Although the pipeline is expected to cross the Missouri just outside of the reservation, it will do so about 40 miles upstream of the tribes\u2019 multimillion-dollar water treatment plant, which supplies clean water to communities throughout the entire region. A leak at this junction,<strong> </strong>they say, could be catastrophic. The project\u2019s backers insist it will be safe.</p> \n<p>The gargantuan underground pipeline is set to carry a daily load of 830,000 barrels of oil over 1,204 miles, from the Athabasca oil sands in Alberta, Canada \u2013 where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/07/keystone-xl-pipeline-reaction-canada-justin-trudeau\">it enjoys the support of the prime minister</a>, Justin Trudeau \u2013 across the US border into eastern Montana. It will travel down to South Dakota, eventually linking with the first Keystone pipeline, which was completed in 2010, in southern Nebraska. The route connects not just countries and states, but three US presidencies. First proposed by the private Canadian infrastructure giant TransCanada during George W Bush\u2019s final months in office, the project was eventually rejected by the Obama administration in 2015, only to be resurrected almost as soon Donald Trump was sworn in at the beginning of this year.<br></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed element--immersive\" data-alt=\"Video\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div id='gv-asset' data-video-type='video' data-caption='Play video' data-src='https://cdn.theguardian.tv/interactive/2017/04/28/170427KeystoneXLDay1_2M_H264.mp4' style='height: calc(100vw * 9 / 16);'></div> <script> function resize(){window.frameElement.height=document.body.offsetHeight}window.addEventListener('resize', resize);resize(); </script></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Its potential pathway crosses 56 rivers and streams, dozens of farms and ranches, and one of the world\u2019s largest groundwater sources, and comes close to a handful of Native American reserves, exposing the deep divisions and unlikely alliances within these rural communities after nearly a decade of struggle \u2013 positions which were entrenched even further by a bitterly divisive presidential election.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--immersive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/05/kxl-map-graphic/giv-3902Gz81MJy6DWGs/index.html\" data-alt=\"Map\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/05/kxl-map-graphic/giv-3902Gz81MJy6DWGs/index.html\">Map</a> \n <figcaption>\n  Graphic by Monica Ulmanu\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The pipeline has been framed as a victory over government regulation and a win for job creation by the Trump administration and those who support the project, but critics characterize the reversal as a success for a foreign business over environmentalism and private land rights. </p> \n<p>As the prospect of construction looms, the Guardian spent one recent week travelling along the proposed US route of the pipeline, meeting with those who will be directly affected by the expansion.

After she saw the protest camps opposing the Dakota Access pipeline, arguably the landmark environmental struggle of the Obama administration and a likely precursor to the future struggle over the Keystone XL pipeline, she felt compelled to travel to the Standing Rock reservation in North Dakota. She stood on the frontlines as protesters <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/29/standing-rock-protest-north-dakota-shutdown-evacuation\">were water-cannoned by police officers in subzero cold last winter</a>.

Already this year, Welch and others here have marched 85 miles along the banks of the Missouri and protested peacefully outside the site of a planned meeting between the tribal council and TransCanada, which was eventually called off.<br></p> \n<p>TransCanada insists it has consulted with all parties along the XL route, including Native American tribal leaders.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--thumbnail\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/04/glasgow-zip/giv-3902VR7nbLpItchB/\" data-alt=\"Glasgow locator\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2017/04/glasgow-zip/giv-3902VR7nbLpItchB/\">Glasgow locator</a> \n</figure> \n<p>But less than an hour down the highway in the old railroad town of Glasgow, the sentiment is the polar opposite.

She watched from her farmhouse as recovery crews drilled holes through the ice in a failed attempt to contain the leak. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed element--showcase\" data-alt=\"Video\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div id='gv-asset' data-video-type='loop' data-caption='Play video' data-src='https://cdn.theguardian.tv/interactive/2017/04/25/170415KXLMTCLIP5_2M_vp8.webm' style='height: calc(100vw * 9 / 16);' ></div> <script> function resize(){window.frameElement.height=document.body.offsetHeight}window.addEventListener('resize', resize);resize(); </script></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>The oil contaminated Glendive\u2019s water treatment plant, polluting the drinking water for upwards of 6,000 people with dangerous levels of the benzene, a known carcinogen. People went without water for days and some in town still distrust the city\u2019s water supply. Hoff recalls that time with evident disgust, arguing city officials were in no way prepared for the leak.</p> \n<p>The Keystone, too, will cross under the Yellowstone river about 13 miles from her farm but still upstream of the town\u2019s water treatment plant. At 36in wide, it is three times more voluminous than the Poplar pipeline and will carry a far dirtier, more corrosive substance, dilbit, which transports the viscous bitumen crude and natural gas liquids. <a href=\"https://www.nap.edu/catalog/21834/spills-of-diluted-bitumen-from-pipelines-a-comparative-study-of\">According to independent studies</a>, this would make a spill much more dangerous and any cleanup operation more complicated. Extracting tar sands also emits considerably more greenhouse gases than regular crude.</p> \n<p>A widely cited independent study in 2011, authored by John Stansbury, an engineering professor at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, found that TransCanada had significantly underestimated the likely number of significant spills (defined as those greater than 50 barrels) over the XL\u2019s lifetime. The company had projected a total of 11 over 50 years. Stansbury, citing a wide range of miscalculations, revised this number almost ten times higher, to 91.</p> \n<p>The academic concluded that in a worst-case leak under the Yellowstone, 165,000 barrels of oil (6.9m gallons) could escape the pipeline. At the XL\u2019s crossing under the Missouri, an extreme break could lead to over 122,000 barrels (5.1m gallons) escaping. </p> \n<p>This week, Stansbury told the Guardian he stood by his conclusions, arguing that TransCanada\u2019s most recent environmental impact statement suffered from the same flaws he identified in 2011. </p> \n<p>A TransCanada spokesman, Terry Cunha, said: \u201cWe disagree with all of the claims made by Mr Stansbury.\u201d He pointed to what the company describes as \u201cstate of the art\u201d leak detection systems it intends to deploy along the XL route, which the company maintains is safe. </p> \n<p>The US state department, which in March issued a permit approving the pipeline, estimated that a leak would convey enough oil to reach a protected body of water once every 542 years.</p> \n<p>For Hoff, the risk is clear. \u201cThere are only two kinds of pipelines,\u201d she says. \u201cThe ones that are leaking and the ones that are going to leak.\u201d</p> \n<p>However, Dennis Zander, a Republican county commissioner in Glendive, who stands outside the county courthouse in a pair of striking off-yellow Ostrich leather boots, accepts the 2015 Poplar leak was \u201can inconvenience\u201d but has no fear about the XL passing close to town. He says emergency services here have learned from past mistakes, and expects the pipeline will bring with it an annual revenue of $5m from additional county property taxes. According to TransCanada, the project would lead to $55.6m in local property taxes in the 27 US counties the pipeline is set to traverse during the first year of operation.</p> \n<p>Zander won\u2019t say how these additional funds will be spent in Glendive. </p> \n<p>The city, like Glasgow, is overwhelmingly white, inside a county that voted at an even higher rate for Trump. The poverty level here is close to the national average as the city reaped the rewards of the Bakken oil boom in the neighboring state of North Dakota, which peaked in 2013. Against rows of unremarkable houses, it is the city\u2019s backdrop that is most striking. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed element--showcase\" data-alt=\"Video loop\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div id='gv-asset' data-video-type='loop' data-caption='Play video' data-src='https://cdn.theguardian.tv/interactive/2017/04/25/170415KXLMTCLIP6_488k_vp8.webm' style='height: calc(100vw * 9 / 16);' ></div> <script> function resize(){window.frameElement.height=document.body.offsetHeight}window.addEventListener('resize', resize);resize(); </script></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Glendive is surrounded by the majestic badland formations of the Makoshika state park, where dozens of pristine dinosaur fossils, preserved by the ice age, have been discovered.

          "bodyText": "\u201cOur people call it the black snake because it is evil,\u201d says Tressa Welch, as thunder clouds steamroll the blue sky over the plains of Wolf Point. \u201cAnd like snakes they come out of nowhere; they slither and strike unknown.\u201d She faces southwards where, a couple of miles away, forks of lightning crack over the Missouri river. The 2m acre Fort Peck Indian reservation straddles this winding water source, providing sustenance for the almost 7,000 Assiniboine and Sioux tribe members here and thousands of others throughout north-east Montana. It is the river that Welch and other Native American activists on the reserve say the Keystone XL oil pipeline \u2013 or the \u201cblack snake\u201d \u2013 will corrupt. The river maintains the deer, the fish, the native plants, sweet grasses and sacred sage. \u201cAnything that threatens my way of life and my spiritual well-being, I consider myself at war with,\u201d she says, her two-year-old daughter by her side. \u201cI will do whatever it takes.\u201d Although the pipeline is expected to cross the Missouri just outside of the reservation, it will do so about 40 miles upstream of the tribes\u2019 multimillion-dollar water treatment plant, which supplies clean water to communities throughout the entire region. A leak at this junction, they say, could be catastrophic. The project\u2019s backers insist it will be safe. The gargantuan underground pipeline is set to carry a daily load of 830,000 barrels of oil over 1,204 miles, from the Athabasca oil sands in Alberta, Canada \u2013 where it enjoys the support of the prime minister, Justin Trudeau \u2013 across the US border into eastern Montana. It will travel down to South Dakota, eventually linking with the first Keystone pipeline, which was completed in 2010, in southern Nebraska. The route connects not just countries and states, but three US presidencies. First proposed by the private Canadian infrastructure giant TransCanada during George W Bush\u2019s final months in office, the project was eventually rejected by the Obama administration in 2015, only to be resurrected almost as soon Donald Trump was sworn in at the beginning of this year. Its potential pathway crosses 56 rivers and streams, dozens of farms and ranches, and one of the world\u2019s largest groundwater sources, and comes close to a handful of Native American reserves, exposing the deep divisions and unlikely alliances within these rural communities after nearly a decade of struggle \u2013 positions which were entrenched even further by a bitterly divisive presidential election. The pipeline has been framed as a victory over government regulation and a win for job creation by the Trump administration and those who support the project, but critics characterize the reversal as a success for a foreign business over environmentalism and private land rights. As the prospect of construction looms, the Guardian spent one recent week travelling along the proposed US route of the pipeline, meeting with those who will be directly affected by the expansion. The journey starts at the Fort Peck reserve, about 80 miles from the Canadian border and the first concentrated population in its pathway, where Tressa Welch and her group of \u201cwater protectors\u201d believe it is a duty endowed upon them by their ancestors to resist the construction. The men here are preparing the land for the Sun Dance festival in June, when the community will gather to pray for good health, fast without water for four days and offer parts of their flesh. \u201cWe give a little piece of ourself back to Mother Earth, because she supplies everything to us,\u201d Welch says. For the 26-year-old, as for many of the young tribal members on this reserve, the election of Trump and the rebirth of Keystone has brought with it a renewed connection to history and culture through activism. Only a few years ago, Welch had worked as a land surveyor carrying out contract work for large oil companies. After she saw the protest camps opposing the Dakota Access pipeline, arguably the landmark environmental struggle of the Obama administration and a likely precursor to the future struggle over the Keystone XL pipeline, she felt compelled to travel to the Standing Rock reservation in North Dakota. She stood on the frontlines as protesters were water-cannoned by police officers in subzero cold last winter. Their hard-fought victory was almost instantly reversed by the election of Trump, but the experience changed her life nonetheless. It is likely that the Fort Peck reservation will be the first frontier of physical opposition to the XL, should a series of recent oppositional lawsuits fail and the final route proposal in Nebraska be approved. Already this year, Welch and others here have marched 85 miles along the banks of the Missouri and protested peacefully outside the site of a planned meeting between the tribal council and TransCanada, which was eventually called off. TransCanada insists it has consulted with all parties along the XL route, including Native American tribal leaders. But less than an hour down the highway in the old railroad town of Glasgow, the sentiment is the polar opposite. Here the city is almost cut in half by the railway track. The town\u2019s station, a single-storey white bricked depot, sits at the centre of the Amtrak Empire Builder line, which runs over 2,000 miles and connects Chicago to the Pacific north-west. Jeff Swanson and RJ Winderl, who both own ranch land the XL will cross, sip coffee and pore over the papers at the local John Deere retailer, which serves as a hub for ranchers who come to sit among friends and peruse the large green tractors and combine harvesters on sale outside. The city is 92% white, in a county that voted 70% for Trump, and there is a sense of resentment expressed by some here for \u201cthe Indians\u201d on the reserve. \u201cThey\u2019re mad because it didn\u2019t go through their reservation, so they\u2019re not getting payment off it,\u201d says Swanson, slamming down his fists. \u201cIt\u2019s greed, that\u2019s all it is.\u201d The cattle rancher signed an easement with TransCanada years ago, which left him with a one-time payment of $15,000 (just 82 cents a day if the project fulfills its 50 year lifespan) in exchange for the use of a quarter of a mile of his pasture land. But Swanson says his support for the project was never about the money. It was politics. He saw the Obama administration\u2019s veto of the project as government overreach and reiterates the essence of one Trump banner in support of it: energy independence. \u201cOur country needs oil. Why import from the Middle Eastern countries when we can take it right from our Canadian neighbor?\u201d The reality, however, dictated by cascading domestic crude prices in the US, is that the majority of final product from the XL will probably be exported to foreign markets after it is processed at refineries on the Gulf Coast. But that doesn\u2019t seem to bother the pair. Perhaps they share the concerns of those on the reserve about the potential for a leak? \u201cWell, the oil comes out of the ground, so it should be good for it,\u201d says Winderl. \u201cThey\u2019re going to double-pipe it anyway. There\u2019s no way it will leak.\u201d \u2022\u2022\u2022 The next stop is about 150 miles south, across the Fort Peck dam. Back in 1933, the construction of this colossal hydraulic system, the largest in the US, brought over 10,000 jobs to the region after President Franklin Roosevelt commissioned it as part of the New Deal. It is lambing season here, just outside the city of Glendive, and Dena Hoff, a sheep farmer, finds it painful to hear of Winderl\u2019s confidence in the pipeline\u2019s integrity. \u201cIt\u2019s just not true,\u201d she says. The dregs of a few surviving snowdrifts are melting in the sun and some of Hoff\u2019s flock are out to pasture a few meters from where, in January 2015, about 40,000 gallons of crude oil, traveling from Canada to southern Montana, escaped from the ageing Poplar pipeline straight into the Yellowstone river. She watched from her farmhouse as recovery crews drilled holes through the ice in a failed attempt to contain the leak. The oil contaminated Glendive\u2019s water treatment plant, polluting the drinking water for upwards of 6,000 people with dangerous levels of the benzene, a known carcinogen. People went without water for days and some in town still distrust the city\u2019s water supply. Hoff recalls that time with evident disgust, arguing city officials were in no way prepared for the leak. The Keystone, too, will cross under the Yellowstone river about 13 miles from her farm but still upstream of the town\u2019s water treatment plant. At 36in wide, it is three times more voluminous than the Poplar pipeline and will carry a far dirtier, more corrosive substance, dilbit, which transports the viscous bitumen crude and natural gas liquids.

          "bodyText": "When Trump won the presidency, someone on 4chan wrote: \u201cWe actually elected a meme as president.\u201d As terrifying as the idea of a meme having access to the nuclear codes is, the age of Trump has ushered in a new age of memes. Jokes on the internet often crop up in the most trying of times \u2013 and with a non-stop news cycle based around whatever the president tweets next, maybe memes are the only way to make sense of the turbulent times we live in. In no particular order, here are some of the memes that have cropped up in the first 100 days of the Trump presidency. Inauguration day It was the day no one really thought would arrive, but arrive it did. On the plus side, there were plenty jokes to be had. There was box-gate: George Bush\u2019s poncho: Then Trump kind of quoted Bane in his inauguration speech: And that\u2019s without even mentioning the crowd sizes debacle. Rogue Whitehouse accounts In Trump administration\u2019s infancy, a strange trend developed, where a bunch of accounts were set up purporting to be run by disgruntled members of government departments. It started with an \u201calternative\u201d Park Services account (@AltParkSer now @NotAltWorld). Soon, around 50 \u201crogue\u201d government accounts had been set up, none of which were verified. But they racked up the followers nonetheless. SEE YOU IN COURT There was much mirth on Twitter when judges in the ninth circuit court of appeals upheld a temporary restraining order on Donald Trump\u2019s controversial travel ban on arrivals from seven Muslim-majority countries. Not from Trump however, who tweeted: Which people found quite funny. Then Hillary Clinton got involved, either referring to the three-strong panel of judges\u2019 unanimous verdict, or more likely the three times the travel ban has been successfully blocked: Tiny Trump Not much to explain here. The internet just really enjoyed making Trump look really tiny. Trump draws Possibly one of the best Twitter accounts of the Trump age \u2013 though we have a while to go yet. As Trump signed executive order after executive order, @TrumpDraws had a different idea of what exactly the president was up to: President Bannon Amid reports chief strategist Steve Bannon actually held sway at the White House, mischievous tweeters began spreading the \u201cPresident Bannon\u201d meme, with the aim of annoying Trump. They even started a campaign: #PostcardstoBannon. Handshakes The president has a weird handshake, as Japanese prime minister Shinz\u014d Abe found: When Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau came to visit, one picture stood out: Although it should be noted, Trudeau did actually shake Trump\u2019s hand. Sean Spicer\u2019s many memes It\u2019s hard to know where to start with the many memes relating to White House press secretary Sean Spicer. But perhaps it\u2019s best to start with his first press conference, in which he berated journalists for not reporting that Trump\u2019s inauguration crowd was the biggest ever.

The US would have to give six months\u2019 notice to withdraw from the free trade agreement and the executive order would start the clock in what the White House viewed as a negotiating tactic to force more favourable terms for renegotiation from Canada and Mexico. However, a White House official told the Guardian on Wednesday that the situation was \u201cmore complicated\u201d than reported.</p> <p>On Thursday Trump characterized the discussion with Pena Nieto and Trudeau as a request from the two leaders for him not to pull out of the trade pact. \u201cI received calls from the President of Mexico and the Prime Minister of Canada asking to renegotiate NAFTA rather than terminate,\u201d the president wrote on Twitter. \u201cI agreed ... subject to the fact that if we do not reach a fair deal for all, we will then terminate NAFTA.

          "bodyText": "The White House has announced that the United States will not unilaterally withdraw from Nafta, the landmark free trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, after multiple reports that Donald Trump was planning to pull out of the deal. In a readout of calls between Trump, Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto on Wednesday, the White House said: \u201cPresident Trump agreed not to terminate Nafta at this time.\u201d However, the statement added \u201cthe leaders agreed to proceed swiftly, according to their required internal procedures, to enable the renegotiation of the Nafta deal to the benefit of all three countries\u201d. The news came after reports on Wednesday that Trump was planning to sign an executive order that would trigger the process for the United States to withdraw from the deal, which was negotiated by the George HW Bush and enacted by Bill Clinton in 1994. The US would have to give six months\u2019 notice to withdraw from the free trade agreement and the executive order would start the clock in what the White House viewed as a negotiating tactic to force more favourable terms for renegotiation from Canada and Mexico. However, a White House official told the Guardian on Wednesday that the situation was \u201cmore complicated\u201d than reported. On Thursday Trump characterized the discussion with Pena Nieto and Trudeau as a request from the two leaders for him not to pull out of the trade pact. \u201cI received calls from the President of Mexico and the Prime Minister of Canada asking to renegotiate NAFTA rather than terminate,\u201d the president wrote on Twitter. \u201cI agreed ... subject to the fact that if we do not reach a fair deal for all, we will then terminate NAFTA.

Conservative Canucks chart course for the age of Trump</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Given those indicators, both profound and seemingly minor, the adoration of Canada and our leader isn\u2019t hard to fathom. And as nerves are being rattled by what appears to be a rightwing reactionary virus crisscrossing the planet \u2013 from Brexit to Le Pen to Erdo\u011fan \u2013 it\u2019s easy to see why Canada\u2019s apparent charms are so seductive. </p> <p>But while I hate to be the bearer of bad tidings, Canada is not immune to the populist appeals of a right-leaning movement \u2013 however phony that populism might be.</p> <p>While Canada\u2019s Conservative party was kicked to the curb <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/federal-election-2015/ridings/\">in the 2015 election</a> \u2013 they won 99 seats in parliament, compared to the victorious Liberals, who won 184 \u2013 that outcome was due in no small part to the country\u2019s multiparty system. While it looked like a landslide, the Conservatives won a respectable 31.9% of the popular vote, to the Liberals\u2019 39.5%. The next election is still a couple of years away, but the Conservatives can hardly be counted out.</p> <p>Three of the most talked-about Conservative candidates running in their current leadership race (vote to take place on 27 May) appear to be appealing to base populist instincts, which has led to some movement in the polls. </p> <p>Kellie Leitch, a cabinet member in the former Conservative government, has argued for a Canadian values test for immigrants and refugees applying for Canadian residency and citizenship. While some of her rivals have criticized her for such a stance \u2013 suggesting she is appealing to racist fears \u2013 she has stuck by this policy idea. Canadian values, she has argued, must be protected. <br></p> <p>Kevin O\u2019Leary, who entered the race somewhat late and has been faulted for not speaking French (an extremely important trait for a federal politician, given the country\u2019s official bilingual status), he has all the bluster and bravado of a purported man of the people. <br></p> <p>A regular cast member on reality TV shows (formerly Dragon\u2019s Den, now Shark Tank), O\u2019Leary is a businessman who especially loves taking shots at Trudeau, and made headlines last month when he argued the Conservative leadership race <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/kevin-oleary-vote-rigging-1.4028998\">was in fact rigged</a>. <br></p> <p>O\u2019Leary made some very specific accusations, among them that backroom organizers had used prepaid credit cards to recruit \u201cfake members\u201d. Leitch tweeted her response, that O\u2019Leary was kicking up a fuss \u201cwithout any evidence. You need to put up or shut up Kevin.\u201d <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a71bc63967dff65dcc62d01997a291807b50104\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a71bc63967dff65dcc62d01997a291807b50104/0_0_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kevin O\u2019Leary, Kellie Leitch and Maxime Bernier\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kevin O\u2019Leary, Kellie Leitch and Maxime Bernier</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Alamy, Getty Images &amp; Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Maxime Bernier, the most experienced candidate and widely perceived as the frontrunner, issued a public statement calling O\u2019Leary a \u201closer\u201d. Bernier added: \u201cI\u2019m a winner.\u201d This, coming from the candidate who most closely resembles an adult. </p> <p>As it turned out, there was some truth to O\u2019Leary\u2019s charges, and that meant the party was forced into an embarrassing acknowledgment and <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/conservative-vote-rigging-investigation-1.4030828\">struck 1,351 names off</a> its membership list. </p> <p>Americans will no doubt be finding this sounds very familiar. The fact is, several candidates in this leadership race are in a giant Trump-off, a panicked rush to see who can appeal to the lowest common denominator of the angriest, most reactionary voters. <br></p> <p>It has that strange taste of an Ayn Rand-Jerry Springer cocktail, the one the Republicans were supposed to evolve out of but that somehow worked under Trump, allowing him to take the electoral college.</p> <p>The other part of this equation is Trudeau himself.

          "bodyText": "Seeing how Americans perceive Canada is a fascinating spectator sport for Canadians. Long a supporting character in the films of Michael Moore, we have been utopianized as the land with sane gun control, universal healthcare, a more cautious approach to war and no death penalty. This romance, of course, has only been enhanced given the stark contrast between our two leaders: Justin Trudeau has embraced refugees from the Middle East \u2013 even greeting them at the airport as they arrived \u2013 and welcomes free trade while talking up environmental protection. It doesn\u2019t hurt that he\u2019s ludicrously photogenic. Meanwhile, you have Donald Trump, who puts ketchup on his steak and describes tremendous pieces of chocolate cake while misidentifying the country he just bombed. Given those indicators, both profound and seemingly minor, the adoration of Canada and our leader isn\u2019t hard to fathom. And as nerves are being rattled by what appears to be a rightwing reactionary virus crisscrossing the planet \u2013 from Brexit to Le Pen to Erdo\u011fan \u2013 it\u2019s easy to see why Canada\u2019s apparent charms are so seductive. But while I hate to be the bearer of bad tidings, Canada is not immune to the populist appeals of a right-leaning movement \u2013 however phony that populism might be. While Canada\u2019s Conservative party was kicked to the curb in the 2015 election \u2013 they won 99 seats in parliament, compared to the victorious Liberals, who won 184 \u2013 that outcome was due in no small part to the country\u2019s multiparty system. While it looked like a landslide, the Conservatives won a respectable 31.9% of the popular vote, to the Liberals\u2019 39.5%. The next election is still a couple of years away, but the Conservatives can hardly be counted out. Three of the most talked-about Conservative candidates running in their current leadership race (vote to take place on 27 May) appear to be appealing to base populist instincts, which has led to some movement in the polls. Kellie Leitch, a cabinet member in the former Conservative government, has argued for a Canadian values test for immigrants and refugees applying for Canadian residency and citizenship. While some of her rivals have criticized her for such a stance \u2013 suggesting she is appealing to racist fears \u2013 she has stuck by this policy idea. Canadian values, she has argued, must be protected. Kevin O\u2019Leary, who entered the race somewhat late and has been faulted for not speaking French (an extremely important trait for a federal politician, given the country\u2019s official bilingual status), he has all the bluster and bravado of a purported man of the people. A regular cast member on reality TV shows (formerly Dragon\u2019s Den, now Shark Tank), O\u2019Leary is a businessman who especially loves taking shots at Trudeau, and made headlines last month when he argued the Conservative leadership race was in fact rigged. O\u2019Leary made some very specific accusations, among them that backroom organizers had used prepaid credit cards to recruit \u201cfake members\u201d. Leitch tweeted her response, that O\u2019Leary was kicking up a fuss \u201cwithout any evidence. You need to put up or shut up Kevin.\u201d Maxime Bernier, the most experienced candidate and widely perceived as the frontrunner, issued a public statement calling O\u2019Leary a \u201closer\u201d. Bernier added: \u201cI\u2019m a winner.\u201d This, coming from the candidate who most closely resembles an adult. As it turned out, there was some truth to O\u2019Leary\u2019s charges, and that meant the party was forced into an embarrassing acknowledgment and struck 1,351 names off its membership list. Americans will no doubt be finding this sounds very familiar. The fact is, several candidates in this leadership race are in a giant Trump-off, a panicked rush to see who can appeal to the lowest common denominator of the angriest, most reactionary voters. It has that strange taste of an Ayn Rand-Jerry Springer cocktail, the one the Republicans were supposed to evolve out of but that somehow worked under Trump, allowing him to take the electoral college. The other part of this equation is Trudeau himself. While an adept politician who campaigned on \u201csunny ways\u201d, deficit spending in the name of job creation and economic stimulus, and the legalization of marijuana, some have argued his government is more decorative than substantial \u2013 and that Trudeau is better at striking a pose than taking a stand. (He is the target of two rather extreme attacks this week alone, for his stance on the environment as well as what some argue is his generally moribund performance as prime minister.) During the election, leftist critics charged that Trudeau was doing what the centrist Liberal party has often done to effectively win a majority in parliament: campaign to the left, while then governing to the right when ultimately achieving power. While Trudeau has championed refugees and is now moving ahead to legalize marijuana, many have expressed anger with his pro-pipeline position, $16bn in arms sales to Saudi Arabia and his abandonment of electoral reform. His promise of electoral reform \u2013 in which Canada\u2019s first-past-the-post system of electing members of parliament would be replaced by something in which voters could use a preferential ballot \u2013 was a promise Trudeau had made literally hundreds of times on the campaign trail and repeated in his throne speech upon taking power. Many suggested the move hit the depths of cynicism in politics, as one of the main reasons the Liberals were abandoning it was that it would clearly make their majority victory far more difficult to repeat. It is this extreme cynicism in the Liberal party that also dogged the American Democratic party; what many saw as pragmatic triangulation and centrism on Hillary Clinton\u2019s part, others saw as selling out. Thus many didn\u2019t bother to vote, even suggesting \u2013 as Susan Sarandon and Ralph Nader appeared to \u2013 that it may as well be Trump, or that a vote for Jill Stein (a candidate who had no hope in hell of winning) was a great idea. The wild card in all of this is the NDP, Canada\u2019s third party, often called the conscience of parliament for their principled stance on a broad range of issues. But principles don\u2019t always make for winning politics, and the farthest they got was when they formed the official opposition under Jack Layton, a wildly charismatic leader who died of cancer not long after savoring the electoral victory. The NDP are currently conducting a leadership race as well. The other wild card is Trump himself.

          "body": "<p>When asked this week what he had learned about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> during the US president\u2019s first months in power, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/justin-trudeau\">Justin Trudeau</a> paused.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/07/canada-donald-trump-nafta-economy-nato\">There goes the neighborhood? Canada frets over Trump's trade agenda</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI\u2019ve learned that he listens,\u201d the Canadian prime minister replied after a few seconds. \u201cHe is a little bit unlike many politicians.\u201d </p> <p>As laughter broke out among the audience at the public Q&amp;A with Bloomberg News, Trudeau continued. Politicians are usually trained to remain on message, he said. \u201c[But] he has shown that, if he says one thing and then actually hears good counter-arguments or good reasons why he should shift his position, he will take a different position, if it\u2019s a better one, if the arguments win him over.\u201d</p> <p>Trudeau\u2019s comments may help to explain how this week, Canada unexpectedly joined the list of countries in the president\u2019s crosshairs. On two separate occasions Trump took aim at Canada\u2019s protectionist trade policies, describing them as a \u201cdisgrace\u201d and \u201cunfair\u201d.</p> <p>It was a sharp reversal from a few months earlier, when Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/13/justin-trudeau-donald-trump-meeting-canada-trade-immigration\">assured Canada that his administration would simply be \u201ctweaking\u201d</a> the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). \u201cWe\u2019ll be doing certain things that are going to benefit both of our countries,\u201d Trump said at the time. \u201cOur relationship with Canada is outstanding.\u201d </p> <p>His words unleashed a sigh of relief in Ottawa, where officials had spent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/23/jared-kushner-canada-justin-trudeau\">months laying the groundwork for a smooth relationship</a> with the new administration. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/07/canada-donald-trump-nafta-economy-nato\">Few countries have as much at stake</a> when it comes to US relations; Canada sends about three-quarters of its annual exports to the US, and nearly 400,000 people a day cross the shared border. Roughly 2.5m jobs in Canada depend on trade with the US. </p> <p>The relief, however, was short-lived. On Tuesday, as he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/apr/18/trump-executive-order-visa-program-foreign-workers-h-1b\">unveiled his \u201cBuy American and Hire American\u201d executive order</a> in Wisconsin, Trump called out Canada and its reliance on import tariffs and production controls to protect its dairy sector. In Canada, Trump said, \u201csome very unfair things have happened to our dairy farmers and others.\u201d </p> <p>He did not elaborate, but his comments were believed to reference a collective price drop by Canadian dairy farmers to compete against imports of ultrafiltered milk, a high-protein concentrate that had been flowing across the border from dairy producers in Wisconsin and New York. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"69d27d52a4eec80e96283def03102c5613eecdad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/69d27d52a4eec80e96283def03102c5613eecdad/0_219_3500_1969/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trudeau and Trump \u2013 frenemies?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trudeau and Trump \u2013 frenemies?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe are also going to stand up for our dairy farmers in Wisconsin,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd that demands, really, immediately, fair trade, with all of our trading partners. And that includes Canada.\u201d</p> <p>Later in the week Trump reiterated his stance, this time widening it into a pointed attack on several sectors north of the border. \u201cCanada, what they\u2019ve done to our dairy farmworkers is a disgrace,\u201d Trump said at the Oval Office. </p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t let Canada or anybody else take advantage and do what they did to our workers and to our farmers \u2026 included in there is lumber, timber and energy.

          "bodyText": "When asked this week what he had learned about Donald Trump during the US president\u2019s first months in power, Justin Trudeau paused. \u201cI\u2019ve learned that he listens,\u201d the Canadian prime minister replied after a few seconds. \u201cHe is a little bit unlike many politicians.\u201d As laughter broke out among the audience at the public Q&amp;A with Bloomberg News, Trudeau continued. Politicians are usually trained to remain on message, he said. \u201c[But] he has shown that, if he says one thing and then actually hears good counter-arguments or good reasons why he should shift his position, he will take a different position, if it\u2019s a better one, if the arguments win him over.\u201d Trudeau\u2019s comments may help to explain how this week, Canada unexpectedly joined the list of countries in the president\u2019s crosshairs. On two separate occasions Trump took aim at Canada\u2019s protectionist trade policies, describing them as a \u201cdisgrace\u201d and \u201cunfair\u201d. It was a sharp reversal from a few months earlier, when Trump assured Canada that his administration would simply be \u201ctweaking\u201d the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). \u201cWe\u2019ll be doing certain things that are going to benefit both of our countries,\u201d Trump said at the time. \u201cOur relationship with Canada is outstanding.\u201d His words unleashed a sigh of relief in Ottawa, where officials had spent months laying the groundwork for a smooth relationship with the new administration. Few countries have as much at stake when it comes to US relations; Canada sends about three-quarters of its annual exports to the US, and nearly 400,000 people a day cross the shared border. Roughly 2.5m jobs in Canada depend on trade with the US. The relief, however, was short-lived. On Tuesday, as he unveiled his \u201cBuy American and Hire American\u201d executive order in Wisconsin, Trump called out Canada and its reliance on import tariffs and production controls to protect its dairy sector. In Canada, Trump said, \u201csome very unfair things have happened to our dairy farmers and others.\u201d He did not elaborate, but his comments were believed to reference a collective price drop by Canadian dairy farmers to compete against imports of ultrafiltered milk, a high-protein concentrate that had been flowing across the border from dairy producers in Wisconsin and New York. \u201cWe are also going to stand up for our dairy farmers in Wisconsin,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd that demands, really, immediately, fair trade, with all of our trading partners. And that includes Canada.\u201d Later in the week Trump reiterated his stance, this time widening it into a pointed attack on several sectors north of the border. \u201cCanada, what they\u2019ve done to our dairy farmworkers is a disgrace,\u201d Trump said at the Oval Office. \u201cWe can\u2019t let Canada or anybody else take advantage and do what they did to our workers and to our farmers \u2026 included in there is lumber, timber and energy. So we\u2019re going to have to get to the negotiating table with Canada very, very quickly.\u201d Trump also reiterated his attack on Nafta, this time adding Canada into the mix. \u201cThe fact is, Nafta \u2013 whether it\u2019s Mexico or Canada \u2013 is a disaster for our country. It\u2019s a disaster. It\u2019s a trading disaster,\u201d he said. Canada\u2019s top envoy to Washington was swift to respond. \u201cCanada does not accept the contention that Canada\u2019s dairy policies are the cause of financial loss for dairy farmers in the United States,\u201d David MacNaughton, Canada\u2019s ambassador to the US, wrote in a letter on Tuesday evening.

As a result, the Slims was reduced to a trickle in less than a week. </p> <p>We can now add river piracy to the growing list of unexpected, dramatic and tragic consequences of human-caused climate change. Although this is the first observed case of river piracy, it likely won\u2019t be the last. </p> <p>The melting of Yukon\u2019s massive Kaskawulsh glacier \u2013 known to the local Southern Tutchone First Nation as T\u00e4nsh\u012b \u2013 caused the drainage gradient to tip in favour of the second river, redirecting the meltwater to the Gulf of Alaska, thousands of miles from its original destination. </p> <p>The science says there\u2019s a 99.5% chance that climate change caused this dramatic transformation of the landscape. The continuing warming trend that caused the glacier to thin so extremely means the change is likely irreversible.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/apr/17/receding-glacier-causes-immense-canadian-river-to-vanish-in-four-days-climate-change\">Receding glacier causes immense Canadian river to vanish in four days</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Such a rapid transformation of the river alters more than just the physical geography and ecosystems of one of Canada\u2019s most majestic and ecologically sensitive regions. It also affects local Indigenous communities. <br></p> <p>Residents near Kluane Lake, which the Slims river used to feed, reported water level changes immediately after the river\u2019s disappearance. The lake is now about three meters lower than normal, and is in jeopardy of being cut off from its own outflows \u2014 making traditional food for the Kluane people, such as trout and whitefish, much harder to find.</p> <p>Climate change\u2019s extreme impacts are obvious to communities throughout the north, from documented hunting season changes and wildlife migrations to rising coastlines and drunken forests, where trees now lean into rivers as permafrost melts and land gives way. </p> <p>We\u2019ve seen images of climate change shrinking the world\u2019s glaciers before, which is worrying, if you consider that these glaciers are like bank accounts: they store snow and ice during cool, wet weather and release water when an area needs it most, during hot, dry summers or droughts. </p> <p>When nature\u2019s thresholds are passed, everything changes. Landscapes are radically transformed in the blink of an eye. In this case, river piracy is a dramatic reminder that the consequences of climate change are often unpredictable. </p> <p>It\u2019s also proof that climate change isn\u2019t a problem of the future. It\u2019s happening now. We\u2019re seeing the increasing effects of climate change every day.</p> <p>So, what to do about this dismal assessment?</p> <p>We must transition our economies quickly and decisively away from fossil fuels to renewable energy, and governments must play leadership roles to make this happen. </p> <p>We must move forward with a common understanding that we are embedded in the natural world, and what we do to our surroundings, we do to ourselves.</p> <p>I was part of the wave of hope that ushered in Justin Trudeau as Canada\u2019s prime minister in 2015. I applauded Canada\u2019s commitments to the Paris agreement, especially our country\u2019s push to limit the average global temperature increase to 1.5C. <br></p> <p>But since Paris, Prime Minister Trudeau has approved two oil pipelines and one of Canada\u2019s largest carbon dioxide-emitting liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects, virtually ensuring that Canada will not meet its own climate targets. <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/17/stop-swooning-justin-trudeau-man-disaster-planet\">Stop swooning over Justin Trudeau.

Humans are the dominant force on the planet, and we\u2019re causing unprecedented impacts.

In the case of the Slims, certainly not the second river, and certainly not nature. We are the pirates, and we\u2019re robbing ourselves.

          "bodyText": "The Slims river in northern Canada gained infamy, not for its fishing or pristine waters, but for vanishing in a matter of four days in May 2016. This week we learned that it fell victim to \u201criver piracy\u201d \u2013 and climate change was almost certainly to blame. The river \u2013 which stretched up to 150 meters at its widest points and averaged depths around three meters \u2013 lost its water source to another nearby river during a period of intense melting affecting one of Canada\u2019s largest glaciers. As a result, the Slims was reduced to a trickle in less than a week. We can now add river piracy to the growing list of unexpected, dramatic and tragic consequences of human-caused climate change. Although this is the first observed case of river piracy, it likely won\u2019t be the last. The melting of Yukon\u2019s massive Kaskawulsh glacier \u2013 known to the local Southern Tutchone First Nation as T\u00e4nsh\u012b \u2013 caused the drainage gradient to tip in favour of the second river, redirecting the meltwater to the Gulf of Alaska, thousands of miles from its original destination. The science says there\u2019s a 99.5% chance that climate change caused this dramatic transformation of the landscape. The continuing warming trend that caused the glacier to thin so extremely means the change is likely irreversible. Such a rapid transformation of the river alters more than just the physical geography and ecosystems of one of Canada\u2019s most majestic and ecologically sensitive regions. It also affects local Indigenous communities. Residents near Kluane Lake, which the Slims river used to feed, reported water level changes immediately after the river\u2019s disappearance. The lake is now about three meters lower than normal, and is in jeopardy of being cut off from its own outflows \u2014 making traditional food for the Kluane people, such as trout and whitefish, much harder to find. Climate change\u2019s extreme impacts are obvious to communities throughout the north, from documented hunting season changes and wildlife migrations to rising coastlines and drunken forests, where trees now lean into rivers as permafrost melts and land gives way. We\u2019ve seen images of climate change shrinking the world\u2019s glaciers before, which is worrying, if you consider that these glaciers are like bank accounts: they store snow and ice during cool, wet weather and release water when an area needs it most, during hot, dry summers or droughts. When nature\u2019s thresholds are passed, everything changes. Landscapes are radically transformed in the blink of an eye. In this case, river piracy is a dramatic reminder that the consequences of climate change are often unpredictable. It\u2019s also proof that climate change isn\u2019t a problem of the future. It\u2019s happening now. We\u2019re seeing the increasing effects of climate change every day. So, what to do about this dismal assessment? We must transition our economies quickly and decisively away from fossil fuels to renewable energy, and governments must play leadership roles to make this happen. We must move forward with a common understanding that we are embedded in the natural world, and what we do to our surroundings, we do to ourselves. I was part of the wave of hope that ushered in Justin Trudeau as Canada\u2019s prime minister in 2015. I applauded Canada\u2019s commitments to the Paris agreement, especially our country\u2019s push to limit the average global temperature increase to 1.5C. But since Paris, Prime Minister Trudeau has approved two oil pipelines and one of Canada\u2019s largest carbon dioxide-emitting liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects, virtually ensuring that Canada will not meet its own climate targets. As the new US president works to dismantle hard-won climate initiatives south of our border, a clear and effective approach to climate change in Canada is more important than ever. Making deep reductions in carbon emissions can\u2019t wait until 2050. Humans are the dominant force on the planet, and we\u2019re causing unprecedented impacts. Human-caused climate change is making events like hurricanes, floods and droughts stronger and more frequent. I believe there\u2019s still hope. Nature has the ability to continue to shock us. If we pull back and give nature room to recover, it may surprise us. So who are the pirates? In the case of the Slims, certainly not the second river, and certainly not nature. We are the pirates, and we\u2019re robbing ourselves. If we don\u2019t act on climate change now, we\u2019re stealing the prospect of a clean and healthy planet from ourselves, our children and generations to come.",

          "body": "<p>I was in a cafe when I first noticed Ryan Gosling. Not <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/ryan-gosling\"><em>the </em>Ryan Gosling</a>, you understand, but a weak simulacrum of the Canadian actor \u2013 a barista called Ben with three key Gosling markers: 1) a soft side parting; 2) a white T-shirt, its sleeves rolled twice; and 3) small, naive tattoos. Ben was preparing a flat white for another Gosling, who was in conversation with yet another. And so, I thought, the old adage is true: you\u2019re never more than six feet from a Gosling. Once you get your eye in, he\u2019s everywhere.</p> <p>At some point in the past few years, Ryan Gosling went from indie actor to representative of a whole type of modern masculinity. And if you were under any doubt as to the pervasiveness of Gosling beyond the barista, further proof: <a href=\"http://junoawards.ca/juno-tv/videos/prime-minster-justin-trudeau-speech-at-the-2017-juno-awards/\">Justin Trudeau in his slimline suit at the Juno awards</a>; Barack Obama louche in an off-duty linen suit; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/gary-lineker\">Gary Lineker</a>, punditing, in tight-fitting shirts; slim <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/dan-stevens\">Dan Stevens</a> on the red carpet; even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/ed-sheeran\">Ed Sheeran</a>, freshly inked. All modern men with good hair, all would-be Goslings.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b4786c45fe1661102092e1d5a6a93be1b3a3a471\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4786c45fe1661102092e1d5a6a93be1b3a3a471/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barack Obama, Dan Stevens, Ed Sheeran, Gary Lineker, Justin Trudeau.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Get the Gosling look (from left): Barack Obama, Dan Stevens, Ed Sheeran, Gary Lineker, Justin Trudeau.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Regardless of age and size, many men these days have the infamous Gosling hallmarks: side parting, tight shirt, a turbo cleanliness (not just Lineker, but the entire <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/oct/14/gary-lineker-bbc-match-of-the-day-motd\">Match Of The Day</a> pundit line-up attempt this look). The appeal is his wardrobe\u2019s simplicity: it\u2019s got a touch of the hipster, but without the irritation; a bit of metrosexual, but without the faff. Your archetypal Gosling man wears slim-cut suits, tight shirts and discreet jewellery. He mixes high street with designer, cares about trainers, but likely relaxes in Gap. He exists in a uniform of white T-shirts, black jeans and Redwing boots and probably spends \u00a3800 on a souvenir jacket but maintains his look is classic, with an edge, much like the man himself. If high fashion can feel alienating \u2013 and right now, with hyper-masculine streetwear and Russian-lad tracksuits at its cutting edge, it certainly can \u2013 then Gosling\u2019s look is a balm.</p> <p>Take <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/sep/22/drive-ryan-gosling-film-review\">the silk jacket Gosling wore in Drive</a> (directed by Nicolas Winding Refn), which was then borrowed five years later by Louis Vuitton and Gucci. \u201cGosling became the pin-up boy for the bomber jacket,\u201d says fashion writer Simon Chilvers, \u201cand that look has become a symbol for the relaxed man.\u201d Too studiedly insouciant to be edgy, too well dressed to wear a tracksuit, that\u2019s Gosling: accessible, green, appealing to both men and women. As my hairdresser, who has Gosling hair, says, \u201cIt\u2019s just easier to dress like him than not.\u201d</p> <p>It all started just over 10 years ago, when Gosling appeared as a benevolent addict teacher in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/apr/20/drama2\">Half Nelson</a>. One Oscar nomination later (always the bridesmaid), he had shifted from Mickey Mouse child star and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_review/0,4267,1246443,00.html\">The Notebook</a> pin-up to Hollywood A-list. Roles in Drive and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jan/13/blue-valentine-review\">Blue Valentine</a> placed him in that modern canon of flawed Hollywood anti-heroes grappling with masculinity and human connection. In the following years, Gosling the brand was distilled and drunk with gay abandon by men between the age of 21 and 45 searching for a look, a role model and a way to pull. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/la-la-land\">La La Land</a> cemented the emotional pin-up status, except with added feeling and jazz, and his forthcoming role as a lovesick troubadour in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otGbg3ZKUKo\">Song To Song</a> will do little to shift this perception.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He represents an idealised version of masculinity: not too good-looking, approachable, a little frayed around the edges</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Popular culture can\u2019t get enough. People magazine tried to name Gosling their sexiest man of the year on four separate occasions, and he reportedly refused each time. And there\u2019s plenty more where that came from: a Gosling-themed Easter egg hunt in New York, a Gosling weather app, Gosling colouring-in books. The <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Hey,+Girl!+memes+gosling&amp;client=firefox-b-ab&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwixrouv3KHTAhUD2hoKHRg1DrQQsAQIGw&amp;biw=2197&amp;bih=1146\">Hey, Girl! memes</a>, which place pithy feminist theory next to images of his face, were sparked by some feminist comments he made in interviews (such as: \u201cI think women are better than men\u2026 stronger. More evolved\u201d), and bred like knotweed on the internet.</p> <p>Then there was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkpCP9R1Jjc\">the series of Vines</a> created by a vlogger in which Gosling repeatedly turns his head away from an oncoming spoonful of cereal (\u201cRyan Gosling won\u2019t eat his cereal\u201d). Following the vlogger\u2019s death two years later (aged 27), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2015/may/05/ryan-gosling-cereal-mchenry-vine-video\">Gosling posted a tribute Vine</a> in which he did, finally, eat his cereal. Some attempts to break the internet have been more successful than others: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2017/mar/09/fake-ryan-gosling-accepts-german-film-award-after-convoluted-prank-video\">in February, a German prank duo sent a barely passable lookalike on stage posing as him to accept an award</a>. In many ways we can blame social media for this bordeline hysterical interest. Gosling\u2019s appeal grew in direct tandem with Tumblr: he is the pin-up of Generation Snapchat, boyfriend to the internet.</p> <p>Sure, Gosling is well dressed, a decent actor and pretty enough, but here\u2019s the rub: he\u2019s not actually <em>that</em> good-looking. The components are there \u2013 6ft tall, kempt hair, bright, puppy-dog eyes \u2013 but it\u2019s not an intimidating beauty. Given the calibre of Hollywood pin-ups, generation by generation \u2013 Marlon Brando, James Dean (proto-Gosling, but hotter), Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio \u2013 how did we end up with someone so relatively bland on our bedroom walls?</p> <p>\u201cHe seems to have been created in a laboratory,\u201d says Samuel Muston, deputy editor of Mr Porter, \u201cwhich is of course fine in an uncle or boss or whatever, but a bit crap in a cinematic icon.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a368334bcca36afa33cd49d5da50c6974c5beebe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a368334bcca36afa33cd49d5da50c6974c5beebe/1835_121_1784_1071/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ryan Gosling\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ryan Gosling: \u2018He seems to have been created in a laboratory.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joel Ryan/Invision/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A casting agent based in LA, who wishes to remain anonymous because \u201cyou never know who might walk through the door\u201d, describes Gosling as a Hollywood \u201cJohn Doe\u201d and \u201cmore than a blank canvas \u2013 he\u2019s every canvas. Good-looking, but not too good-looking.

          "bodyText": "I was in a cafe when I first noticed Ryan Gosling. Not the Ryan Gosling, you understand, but a weak simulacrum of the Canadian actor \u2013 a barista called Ben with three key Gosling markers: 1) a soft side parting; 2) a white T-shirt, its sleeves rolled twice; and 3) small, naive tattoos. Ben was preparing a flat white for another Gosling, who was in conversation with yet another. And so, I thought, the old adage is true: you\u2019re never more than six feet from a Gosling. Once you get your eye in, he\u2019s everywhere. At some point in the past few years, Ryan Gosling went from indie actor to representative of a whole type of modern masculinity. And if you were under any doubt as to the pervasiveness of Gosling beyond the barista, further proof: Justin Trudeau in his slimline suit at the Juno awards; Barack Obama louche in an off-duty linen suit; Gary Lineker, punditing, in tight-fitting shirts; slim Dan Stevens on the red carpet; even Ed Sheeran, freshly inked. All modern men with good hair, all would-be Goslings. Regardless of age and size, many men these days have the infamous Gosling hallmarks: side parting, tight shirt, a turbo cleanliness (not just Lineker, but the entire Match Of The Day pundit line-up attempt this look). The appeal is his wardrobe\u2019s simplicity: it\u2019s got a touch of the hipster, but without the irritation; a bit of metrosexual, but without the faff. Your archetypal Gosling man wears slim-cut suits, tight shirts and discreet jewellery. He mixes high street with designer, cares about trainers, but likely relaxes in Gap. He exists in a uniform of white T-shirts, black jeans and Redwing boots and probably spends \u00a3800 on a souvenir jacket but maintains his look is classic, with an edge, much like the man himself. If high fashion can feel alienating \u2013 and right now, with hyper-masculine streetwear and Russian-lad tracksuits at its cutting edge, it certainly can \u2013 then Gosling\u2019s look is a balm. Take the silk jacket Gosling wore in Drive (directed by Nicolas Winding Refn), which was then borrowed five years later by Louis Vuitton and Gucci. \u201cGosling became the pin-up boy for the bomber jacket,\u201d says fashion writer Simon Chilvers, \u201cand that look has become a symbol for the relaxed man.\u201d Too studiedly insouciant to be edgy, too well dressed to wear a tracksuit, that\u2019s Gosling: accessible, green, appealing to both men and women. As my hairdresser, who has Gosling hair, says, \u201cIt\u2019s just easier to dress like him than not.\u201d It all started just over 10 years ago, when Gosling appeared as a benevolent addict teacher in Half Nelson. One Oscar nomination later (always the bridesmaid), he had shifted from Mickey Mouse child star and The Notebook pin-up to Hollywood A-list. Roles in Drive and Blue Valentine placed him in that modern canon of flawed Hollywood anti-heroes grappling with masculinity and human connection. In the following years, Gosling the brand was distilled and drunk with gay abandon by men between the age of 21 and 45 searching for a look, a role model and a way to pull. La La Land cemented the emotional pin-up status, except with added feeling and jazz, and his forthcoming role as a lovesick troubadour in Song To Song will do little to shift this perception. Popular culture can\u2019t get enough. People magazine tried to name Gosling their sexiest man of the year on four separate occasions, and he reportedly refused each time. And there\u2019s plenty more where that came from: a Gosling-themed Easter egg hunt in New York, a Gosling weather app, Gosling colouring-in books. The Hey, Girl! memes, which place pithy feminist theory next to images of his face, were sparked by some feminist comments he made in interviews (such as: \u201cI think women are better than men\u2026 stronger. More evolved\u201d), and bred like knotweed on the internet. Then there was the series of Vines created by a vlogger in which Gosling repeatedly turns his head away from an oncoming spoonful of cereal (\u201cRyan Gosling won\u2019t eat his cereal\u201d). Following the vlogger\u2019s death two years later (aged 27), Gosling posted a tribute Vine in which he did, finally, eat his cereal. Some attempts to break the internet have been more successful than others: in February, a German prank duo sent a barely passable lookalike on stage posing as him to accept an award. In many ways we can blame social media for this bordeline hysterical interest. Gosling\u2019s appeal grew in direct tandem with Tumblr: he is the pin-up of Generation Snapchat, boyfriend to the internet. Sure, Gosling is well dressed, a decent actor and pretty enough, but here\u2019s the rub: he\u2019s not actually that good-looking. The components are there \u2013 6ft tall, kempt hair, bright, puppy-dog eyes \u2013 but it\u2019s not an intimidating beauty. Given the calibre of Hollywood pin-ups, generation by generation \u2013 Marlon Brando, James Dean (proto-Gosling, but hotter), Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio \u2013 how did we end up with someone so relatively bland on our bedroom walls? \u201cHe seems to have been created in a laboratory,\u201d says Samuel Muston, deputy editor of Mr Porter, \u201cwhich is of course fine in an uncle or boss or whatever, but a bit crap in a cinematic icon.\u201d A casting agent based in LA, who wishes to remain anonymous because \u201cyou never know who might walk through the door\u201d, describes Gosling as a Hollywood \u201cJohn Doe\u201d and \u201cmore than a blank canvas \u2013 he\u2019s every canvas. Good-looking, but not too good-looking. The guy the girl thinks she can get, and that\u2019s what we want from our leading men.\u201d She adds: \u201cHe\u2019s what we call a personality actor, which I suppose makes him more than a pin-up. It makes him \u2018boyfriend material\u2019.\u201d Another theory is psychological. \u201cOur attraction to Gosling is as much about personality as it is about looks,\u201d says Viren Swami, a professor of social psychology. \u201cHe represents an idealised version of masculinity: not too good-looking, approachable, a nice guy who is a little frayed around the edges.\u201d He is a tender kook: manly but self-deprecating, fit but forgettable. It\u2019s very hard to hate him because we don\u2019t know what we hate. The agent thinks Gosling\u2019s bankability also comes down to what psychologists call \u201cexposure\u201d, or the power of suggestion. The more you see him, the more you fancy him. I ask my friend Josh, who is routinely compared to Gosling (some of his colleagues actually thought he was Ryan Gosling) about his experiences. He is a blue-eyed blond and has a similar build to the actor, but says he finds it baffling. \u201cI think some people just have Ryan Gosling on the mind and therefore see vague resemblances in people like me.\u201d Back in the cafe, I order a flat white and ask Ben, the barista, whether he thinks he looks like Ryan Gosling. He smiles and says no, telling me that\u2019s absurd. I look at the side-parted hair, the not-too-tight T-shirt, and realise he\u2019s lying. He is constantly told that he does \u2013 which is why he looks, talks and acts the way he does. But then, no true Gosling would admit to that, would he? How to spot a Gosling Wears his hair in a smooth side parting. Owns 12 identical white cotton T-shirts. Rolls T-shirt sleeves twice, and shirt sleeves to the elbow (adding a slim-fit blazer for formal occasions). Owns several pairs of identical relaxed jeans \u2013 slim, not skinny \u2013 always worn with a laced boot. Rarely shaves \u201call the way\u201d. Has abs, but doesn\u2019t talk about the gym. Lists the word \u201cfeminist\u201d in his Twitter profile. Has a naive \u201cstick and poke\u201d tattoo \u2013 and regrets it. Does not believe in capitalism, but spends more than \u00a3180 on a statement pair of trousers. Only dates older women. Wears everything a size too small. Says: \u201cIf I ever mansplain, euthanise me.\u201d Ghosts the women he\u2019s dating\u2026 \u2026 yet lives to be objectified by them.",

          "bodyText": "Theresa May is on a five-day walking holiday in Snowdonia but is \u201cmaking calls and being constantly updated\u201d on the meeting of G7 foreign ministers and events in Russia and Syria, her spokesman has said. The prime minister \u2013 who spoke her Canadian counterpart, Justin Trudeau, while on a short Easter break in Wales \u2013 attended a Palm Sunday service in St Mary\u2019s church in Dolgellau, Gwynedd, with her husband, Philip. She was also spotted buying a \u00a332 sterling silver ring in the Celf Aran Arts shop in the town square, made by Barmouth jeweller Anna Hicks, as well as some Welsh slate coasters. She was photographed wearing the jewellery at the church service on Sunday. Hicks told the Daily Post she was delighted the prime minister had bought some of her work. \u201cWhen I first heard she had bought some of my pieces, I thought it was a wind-up, but I am very pleased that she liked the rings,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are practical rings that can be worn every day. \u201cWe would be delighted if she came back to the shop. Apparently she\u2019s a regular visitor and I think it\u2019s great that she buys locally when she is here.\u201d Matt Fletcher, who served the prime minister, told the paper he had been so nervous that he had fumbled his keys for the jewellery display case. \u201cI said to her, \u2018Is it you?\u2019 And she said: \u2018Well, it depends on who \u201cyou\u201d is.\u2019 She was really down to earth.\u201d The Mays go on regular walking holidays, including to the Swiss Alps, but are also repeat visitors to Snowdonia and the Brecon Beacons. The prime minister told Wales Online this month she had been visitingthe area for some years. Her predecessor, David Cameron, also often holidayed in the UK, but preferred surfing trips to the Cornish coast. \u201cWalking in Wales is an opportunity to get out and about and see scenery and clear your mind and your thinking,\u201d May said. \u201cWe stay in a hotel and try to walk every day. Walking is about relaxing, getting exercise and fresh air.\u201d However, May said she and her husband did not discuss politics during their hikes, for fearing of losing concentration and stumbling on steep hills. The prime minister said she had to avoid Welsh cakes because of her type 1 diabetes, but said she prefers red Welsh lamb and cheeses. A spokesperson for No 10 said: \u201cThe prime minister and her husband are taking a short UK break away from the office. She will continue to be briefed and updated as required. She is a regular visitor to Snowdonia to go walking.\u201d The Commons will return from its Easter recess next Tuesday.",

We\u2019re already starting to get calls from representatives from other countries, asking what we\u2019re doing.\u201d </p> <p>It hasn\u2019t all been smooth sailing: OrganiGram and two other licensed producers in Canada <a href=\"http://healthycanadians.gc.ca/recall-alert-rappel-avis/hc-sc/2017/61750r-eng.php\">recently issued a voluntary recall of much of its products</a> sold in 2016 after five lots tested positive for low levels of two unapproved pesticides. The company has since put in place <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.organigram.ca/latest/organigram-posts-highest-single-week-sales/\">new growing and harvesting protocols</a>.</p> <p>The fast-growing industry has also been in a holding pattern as of late. Some worry that the federal government\u2019s timeline of July 2018 is too ambitious, <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/ottawa-plans-for-cannabis-legalization-may-be-slowed-by-provinces/article34441770/\">given the scope of work likely to be left to the provinces</a>. A date of 2019 has been <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/ottawa-rushing-to-draft-marijuana-legalization-bill-ahead-of-420-sources-say/article34431990/\">floated as more likely</a>.</p> <p>And while eight US states and the District of Columbia have voted to legalise recreational marijuana, the White House has hinted that the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/02/23/white-house-hints-at-greater-enforcement-of-federal-marijuana-ban-in-states-where-its-legal/?utm_term=.4a723ff5e363\">Department of Justice will do more to enforce federal laws</a> prohibiting recreational marijuana, <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/investment-ideas/marijuana-stocks-drop-as-trudeaus-pot-czar-says-canada-wont-rush-into-legalization/article34230589/\">raising concerns over how Canada\u2019s approach</a> will coexist with a potential crackdown south of the border.</p> <p>Nearly 400,000 people a day cross the shared border between Canada and the US, and any clampdown on the border could have economic repercussions for Canada, which last year sent three-quarters of its exports to the US.</p> <p>Still, many in this province continue to push forward. In October, a New Brunswick college announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/04/canada-college-new-brunswick-marijuana-cultivation-course\">it would launch a specialised program on marijuana cultivation</a> aimed at prepping potential workers for everything from quality control to harvesting. The program, which could be on offer as early as autumn of this year, will compensate for the fact that \u201cmost of the experience that exists within the cultivation of marijuana happens in the black market\u201d, said Gracewood.</p> <p>It\u2019s a necessary development as the industry moves out of the shadows and into legalisation \u2013 and another building block that could help the province reap the benefits. \u201cThis industry is going to exist whether New Brunswick likes it or not. And the thing that\u2019s most encouraging to me, is that as a province, they\u2019ve truly embraced the opportunity,\u201d said Gracewood. \u201cMy sense is that New Brunswick will be one of the most prepared provinces in Canada when the opportunity arises.\u201d</p>",

We\u2019re already starting to get calls from representatives from other countries, asking what we\u2019re doing.\u201d It hasn\u2019t all been smooth sailing: OrganiGram and two other licensed producers in Canada recently issued a voluntary recall of much of its products sold in 2016 after five lots tested positive for low levels of two unapproved pesticides. The company has since put in place new growing and harvesting protocols. The fast-growing industry has also been in a holding pattern as of late. Some worry that the federal government\u2019s timeline of July 2018 is too ambitious, given the scope of work likely to be left to the provinces. A date of 2019 has been floated as more likely. And while eight US states and the District of Columbia have voted to legalise recreational marijuana, the White House has hinted that the Department of Justice will do more to enforce federal laws prohibiting recreational marijuana, raising concerns over how Canada\u2019s approach will coexist with a potential crackdown south of the border. Nearly 400,000 people a day cross the shared border between Canada and the US, and any clampdown on the border could have economic repercussions for Canada, which last year sent three-quarters of its exports to the US. Still, many in this province continue to push forward. In October, a New Brunswick college announced it would launch a specialised program on marijuana cultivation aimed at prepping potential workers for everything from quality control to harvesting. The program, which could be on offer as early as autumn of this year, will compensate for the fact that \u201cmost of the experience that exists within the cultivation of marijuana happens in the black market\u201d, said Gracewood. It\u2019s a necessary development as the industry moves out of the shadows and into legalisation \u2013 and another building block that could help the province reap the benefits. \u201cThis industry is going to exist whether New Brunswick likes it or not. And the thing that\u2019s most encouraging to me, is that as a province, they\u2019ve truly embraced the opportunity,\u201d said Gracewood. \u201cMy sense is that New Brunswick will be one of the most prepared provinces in Canada when the opportunity arises.\u201d",

The President is bound by the US Constitution, the War Powers Resolution, and the international laws of armed conflict\u2014but Congress has never authorized military action against the Assad regime, and the President took this action without approval by the United Nations or any claim of self-defense.</p> <p>\u201cSecond, what is the President\u2019s plan for Syria going forward? For years, Donald Trump warned President Obama not to get involved in Syria. The central theme of his campaign was \u2018America First.\u2019 He is not empowered to commit our troops to a new war on a whim, however brutal the actions of President Assad.</p> <p>\u201cFinally, how does President Trump reconcile this action with the other policies of his Administration? Like the President, I am haunted by the images of the children who have been murdered in this civil war. Like many of my colleagues, I wonder if the President understands that the refugees he hopes to ban from entry to the United States seek shelter from the same conflict. </p> <p>\u201cI join with Leader Pelosi in <a href=\"http://www.democraticleader.gov/newsroom/4717/\">her request</a> to reconvene the House immediately to demand answers to these questions.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Trump <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/07/us/politics/military-force-presidential-power.html\">did not have clear authority</a> under international law to order the strikes, according to law professors and attorneys.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58e7fefbe4b0e0ec04efeccb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-04-07T21:09:43.895Z\">10.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Tillerson has called Russia\u2019s reaction to the US missile strikes \u201cvery disappointing\u201d but \u201cnot all that surprising\u201d, the AP reports, after the secretary of state spoke briefly with reporters at the south Florida summit with a Chinese delegation staying at Donald Trump\u2019s resort, Mar-a-Lago.</p> <p>The Kremlin condemned the strike as an \u201cact of aggression\u201d against a sovereign state, and a violation of international law.

Then a colonel \u201cand an unorthodox military thinker\u201d, they write, McMaster immersed himself in Iraqi culture and tried to portray the US \u201cnot as an occupier, but a protector of the town\u2019s 150,000 inhabitants\u201d.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>But he combined this \u201chearts and minds\u201d approach with tough, disciplined military engagement.

The list of names on<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/dec/16/iraq.topstories3\"> a memorial in the middle of the base</a> testified to the high casualty rate among his Third Armoured Cavalry Regiment.</p> <p>The strategy applied in Tal Afar \u2013 to take the local population with you and, when a decision to use military force is made, go in hard \u2013 came to be adopted by the US military across Iraq in 2007, an expansion of American forces that became known as the Iraqi \u201csurge\u201d.</p> </blockquote> <p>McMaster, 54, was born in Philadelphia, and in part rose to his service in 1991, when he led nine tanks against an estimated 80 tanks and vehicles under Saddam Hussein\u2019s military \u2013 the American tanks destroyed them inferior Iraqi vehicles, with no US casualties. Later in the decade McMaster wrote a book, Dereliction of Duty, that condemned the failures of American leadership in Vietnam, in particular, in his view, compromises that doomed the war effort. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>People close to McMaster say that an early priority for the three-star general was to marginalise Bannon and re-empower the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and director of national intelligence, whose places on the principals\u2019 committee of the national security council Bannon had taken.

They point to a critical behind-the-scenes ally: defence secretary James Mattis, who has played a similar role to McMaster at the Pentagon and strikes similar notes on hostility towards Russia, openness to Nato and reassurance to South Korea and Japan. </p> <p>Both men are positioning themselves as reliable points of contact to US allies confused by the mercurial Trump, but without contradicting the president directly.</p> </blockquote> <p>You can read more about McMaster, and the ultimate fate of Tal Afar, through the link below.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/07/trumps-security-chief-shaped-by-tough-posting-near-syria\">Trump's security chief shaped by tough posting near Syria</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58e7dd8de4b0e0ec04efec50\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-04-07T19:31:19.162Z\">8.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">What we know</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Early Friday morning local time from warships in the eastern Mediterranean, the United States launched 59 Tomahawk missiles at a Syrian government airfield near Homs, in retaliation for a Syrian chemical weapons attack earlier this week that killed dozens of civilians, including children. </p> <p>The missiles were the first direct attack against President Bashar al-Assad over six years of Syria\u2019s civil war, after years warnings over humanitarian abuses, including bombing hospitals and the use of the sarin nerve agent and chlorine gas.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Donald Trump ordered the attacks on Thursday afternoon</strong>, en route to a south Florida summit with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. The strikes took place at about 7.40pm local time while the presidents had dinner.

Parliamentarians from 47 countries meet four times a year in the parliamentary assembly in Strasbourg, though Russia has not returned to the assembly following its suspension in 2014 in response to the annexation of Crimea.</p> <p> Tass had described Agramunt as Pace president, though officials at the Council of Europe have insisted he was not making an official visit. Agramunt\u2019s \u201cinitiative does not commit the Council of Europe in any way\u201d, said a spokesman.</p> <p>The office of the Pace president had not immediately responded to the Guardian\u2019s request for comment when this blog post was published.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-04-07T16:59:36.701Z\">at 5.59pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58e7bc52e4b0e0ec04efebc8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-04-07T16:21:05.093Z\">5.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Trump\u2019s airstrike is a convenient U-turn from a president who can\u2019t be trusted, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/07/convenient-u-turn-president-who-cant-be-trusted\">writes Jonathan Freedland.</a><br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58e7ba88e4b05776df18b8d6\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-04-07T16:14:45.632Z\">5.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Britain\u2019s UN Ambassador Matthew Rycroft: Assad has been 'put on notice'</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Britain\u2019s UN ambassador, Matthew Rycroft, has said Assad has been \u201cput on notice\u201d by the US airstrike, describing it as a \u201cproportionate response to unspeakable acts\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWithout Russia\u2019s seven vetoes in the security council, defying the views of other members of this council, Assad would have faced sanctions and justice,\u201d Rycroft told the 15-member council. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-04-07T17:08:41.461Z\">at 6.08pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58e7ba1be4b05776df18b8d1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-04-07T16:12:40.172Z\">5.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said he supported the \u201cstrong and clear message\u201d sent by the US airstrike.</p> <p>The Israeli military said it had been informed in advance of the strike. \u201cIn both word and action, President Trump sent a strong and clear message today that the use and spread of chemical weapons will not be tolerated,\u201d a statement from Netanyahu\u2019s office said. \u201cIsrael fully supports President Trump\u2019s decision and hopes that this message of resolve in the face of the Assad regime\u2019s horrific actions will resonate not only in Damascus, but in Tehran, Pyongyang and elsewhere.\u201d</p> <p>Hours after those remarks, the US vice-president, Mike Pence, called the Israeli premier and thanked him in Trump\u2019s name for the Israeli support of the US attack in Syria, Netanyahu\u2019s office said.

He said:<br></p> <blockquote> <p>That\u2019s it. The last remaining election fog has lifted. Instead of an overworked statement about a joint fight against the biggest enemy, Isis (Islamic State), the Trump administration proved that it will fiercely fight the legitimate Syrian government, in a tough contradiction with international law and without UN approval, in violation of its own procedures stipulating that the Congress must first be notified of any military operation unrelated to aggression against the US. On the verge of a military clash with Russia.</p> <p>Nobody is overestimating the value of pre-election promises, but there must be limits of decency. Beyond that is absolute mistrust. Which is really sad for our now completely ruined relations. And which is good news for terrorists.</p> <p>One more thing. This military action is a clear indication of the US president\u2019s extreme dependency on the opinion of the Washington establishment, the one that the new president strongly criticised in his inauguration speech. Soon after his victory, I noted that everything would depend on how soon Trump\u2019s election promises would be broken by the existing power machine.

          "bodyText": "We\u2019re going to close our rolling coverage of the first direct military strikes by the US against Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, in what Donald Trump described as necessary retaliation for a chemical weapons attack that killed dozens of civilians, including children, earlier this week. Fifty-nine Tomahawk missiles, launched before dawn from warships in the eastern Mediterranean, threatened hopes for Russian-American rapprochement just ahead of the first major meeting between Washington, which has armed anti-Assad rebels, and Moscow, which has held Assad up against them. Secretary of state Rex Tillerson will travel to Moscow on Tuesday, just three days after the US ambassador to the UN said Russia shouldered blame in the chemical weapons attack. Donald Trump ordered the attacks on Thursday afternoon and the strikes took place at about 7.40pm local time while he had dinner in south Florida with Chinese president Xi Jinping. Afterward Trump told the American people it is in their \u201cvital national security interest\u201d to \u201cprevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons\u201d. The Pentagon alerted Russian military counterparts to minimize the risk of conflict. A spokesman said the strike appeared to have \u201cseverely damaged or destroyed Syrian aircraft\u201d. Russian authorities disputed the claim, saying many missiles missed their targets. By Friday afternoon the base was already launching flights again, according to AFP. The American ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, said the US \u201ctook a very measured step\u201d and \u201cwe are prepared to do more\u201d. She added that Iran and Russia bore \u201cheavy responsibility\u201d for the chemical attack, either by allowing Assad to use such weapons or through \u201cincompetent\u201d oversight of their ally\u2019s obligations. \u201cThe world is waiting for Russia to reconsider its misplaced alliance with Bashar al-Assad,\u201d she said. \u201cThe United States will no longer wait.\u201d A spokesman for Vladimir Putin said the US had violated international law \u201cunder a false pretext\u201d, and UN deputy ambassador, Vladimir Safronkov, warned \u201cextremely serious\u201d consequences could follow the strike. The prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, said the action \u201ccompletely ruined relations\u201d. Russia\u2019s military announced it would bolster Assad\u2019s air defenses, and it was not clear whether it would cut off the \u201cdeconfliction\u201d hotline it uses to avoid clashes between US and Russian forces. Assad\u2019s office said the strike was \u201cfoolish and irresponsible\u201d and promised to redouble its efforts against rebels. His ambassador to the UN, Bashar Jaafari, claimed on Friday that \u201ca number of martyrs, including women and children\u201d were killed by the attack. An unnamed Syrian official told the AP that at least seven people were killed and nine wounded. Jaafari also claimed that the Syrian government had no chemical weapons. Syrian rebels welcomed the strike and called for more. \u201cHitting one airbase is not enough \u2013 there are 26 airbases that target civilians,\u201d a key figure in the Army of Islam faction, Mohamed Alloush, said on Twitter. \u201cThe whole world should save the Syrian people from the clutches of the killer Bashar and his aides.\u201d The US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, said the strikes did not indicate a shift in US policy toward Syria, even though a few days earlier American diplomats had said Assad\u2019s ouster was no longer a priority. The White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, said the strikes had a limited intent \u2013 to deter chemical weapons \u2013 and were of a piece with Trump\u2019s so-called \u201cAmerica first\u201d policy. The UK, Australia, Israel and Saudi Arabia were among the US allies that voiced support for the strikes, while Italy and Japan said they understood the action. The US military strikes against the Syrian airbase had no \u201cdirect consequence\u201d on aid operations in Syria, said the UN coordinator for humanitarian affairs, Jens Laerke. A UN human rights office spokeswoman, Ravina Shamdasani, said on Friday at a UN briefing that the use of chemical weapons, if confirmed, would amount to a war crime. Members of Congress, led in part by representative John Conyers, have questioned the legality of the president\u2019s decision to launch missiles against Bashar al-Assad. The concern follows a burst of support for the strikes \u2013 from Republican and Democratic leaders alike \u2013 on the night they were ordered. Conyers has released a statement: \u201cThere is no question that the United States must do more to relieve the suffering of the civilians trapped in Syria\u2019s civil war. \u201cBut before we can debate the wisdom of a single unilateral strike on a Syrian air field, President Trump must answer a number of threshold answers: \u201cFirst, what is the legal basis for the President\u2019s military intervention in Syria? The President is bound by the US Constitution, the War Powers Resolution, and the international laws of armed conflict\u2014but Congress has never authorized military action against the Assad regime, and the President took this action without approval by the United Nations or any claim of self-defense. \u201cSecond, what is the President\u2019s plan for Syria going forward? For years, Donald Trump warned President Obama not to get involved in Syria. The central theme of his campaign was \u2018America First.\u2019 He is not empowered to commit our troops to a new war on a whim, however brutal the actions of President Assad. \u201cFinally, how does President Trump reconcile this action with the other policies of his Administration? Like the President, I am haunted by the images of the children who have been murdered in this civil war. Like many of my colleagues, I wonder if the President understands that the refugees he hopes to ban from entry to the United States seek shelter from the same conflict. \u201cI join with Leader Pelosi in her request to reconvene the House immediately to demand answers to these questions.\u201d Trump did not have clear authority under international law to order the strikes, according to law professors and attorneys. Tillerson has called Russia\u2019s reaction to the US missile strikes \u201cvery disappointing\u201d but \u201cnot all that surprising\u201d, the AP reports, after the secretary of state spoke briefly with reporters at the south Florida summit with a Chinese delegation staying at Donald Trump\u2019s resort, Mar-a-Lago. The Kremlin condemned the strike as an \u201cact of aggression\u201d against a sovereign state, and a violation of international law. At the UN, Russia\u2019s representative said the security council should condemn air strikes in Iraq, by the US-led coalition, that had killed scores of civilians last month, and that the US had not shown proof that Syria was responsible for the chemical weapons. According to the AP, Tillerson said that Russia\u2019s reaction shows that nation\u2019s continued support for a regime that \u201ccarries out these types of horrendous attacks on their own people.\u201d The US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, has reiterated the message that UN ambassador Nikki Haley gave to the security council earlier on Friday: Russia bears responsibility for last week\u2019s chemical weapons attack by Bashar al-Assad\u2019s forces. Russia and Syria have claimed that the US has jumped to conclusions and does not actually know who was responsible for the attack, although Pentagon officials have said they watched, on radar, warplanes carry out the strikes from Shayrat airbase onto the town of Khan Sheikhun. Before Donald Trump decided that the US should retaliate against Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, he frequently argued that the United States has little responsibility, if any, to take any action in Syria. In 2013 and 2014, he repeatedly said that Barack Obama would be \u201cvery foolish\u201d to take military action in Syria. \u201cSyria is NOT our problem,\u201d he wrote in May 2013. In August: \u201cHow bad has our \u201cleader\u201d made us look on Syria. Stay out of Syria, we don\u2019t have the leadership to win wars or even strategize.\u201d Followed by: \u201cWhat will we get for bombing Syria besides more debt and a possible long term conflict? Obama needs Congressional approval.\u201d Trump has not gained congressional approval for the missile strikes he ordered on Thursday night. In September: \u201cPresident Obama, do not attack Syria. There is no upside and tremendous downside. Save your \u201cpowder\u201d for another (and more important) day!\u201d \u201cDo NOT attack Syria, fix USA,\u201d he continued. \u201cWhat I am saying is stay out of Syria.\u201d HR McMaster, the national security adviser for Donald Trump who replaced Michael Flynn, was central to the decision to attack the Syrian airbase near Homs, according to my colleagues Spencer Ackerman and Ewen MacAskill. McMaster was posted in 2005 at the town of Tal Afar, which was held by jihadi forces near the Syrian border. Then a colonel \u201cand an unorthodox military thinker\u201d, they write, McMaster immersed himself in Iraqi culture and tried to portray the US \u201cnot as an occupier, but a protector of the town\u2019s 150,000 inhabitants\u201d. But he combined this \u201chearts and minds\u201d approach with tough, disciplined military engagement. He had a large sand berm built around the town to control entry and exit, and retook neighbourhoods house by house. The list of names on a memorial in the middle of the base testified to the high casualty rate among his Third Armoured Cavalry Regiment. The strategy applied in Tal Afar \u2013 to take the local population with you and, when a decision to use military force is made, go in hard \u2013 came to be adopted by the US military across Iraq in 2007, an expansion of American forces that became known as the Iraqi \u201csurge\u201d. McMaster, 54, was born in Philadelphia, and in part rose to his service in 1991, when he led nine tanks against an estimated 80 tanks and vehicles under Saddam Hussein\u2019s military \u2013 the American tanks destroyed them inferior Iraqi vehicles, with no US casualties. Later in the decade McMaster wrote a book, Dereliction of Duty, that condemned the failures of American leadership in Vietnam, in particular, in his view, compromises that doomed the war effort. People close to McMaster say that an early priority for the three-star general was to marginalise Bannon and re-empower the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and director of national intelligence, whose places on the principals\u2019 committee of the national security council Bannon had taken. At a stroke, McMaster accomplished that this week, establishing his supremacy over the homeland security and economic councils for good measure, and cementing his alliances with joint chiefs chairman General Joe Dunford and intelligence chief Dan Coats. McMaster\u2019s camp has been crowing about their man\u2019s victory. They point to a critical behind-the-scenes ally: defence secretary James Mattis, who has played a similar role to McMaster at the Pentagon and strikes similar notes on hostility towards Russia, openness to Nato and reassurance to South Korea and Japan. Both men are positioning themselves as reliable points of contact to US allies confused by the mercurial Trump, but without contradicting the president directly. You can read more about McMaster, and the ultimate fate of Tal Afar, through the link below. Early Friday morning local time from warships in the eastern Mediterranean, the United States launched 59 Tomahawk missiles at a Syrian government airfield near Homs, in retaliation for a Syrian chemical weapons attack earlier this week that killed dozens of civilians, including children. The missiles were the first direct attack against President Bashar al-Assad over six years of Syria\u2019s civil war, after years warnings over humanitarian abuses, including bombing hospitals and the use of the sarin nerve agent and chlorine gas. Donald Trump ordered the attacks on Thursday afternoon, en route to a south Florida summit with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. The strikes took place at about 7.40pm local time while the presidents had dinner. Afterward Trump told the American people it is in their \u201cvital national security interest\u201d to \u201cprevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons\u201d. The Pentagon alerted Russian military counterparts to minimize the risk of conflict. A spokesman said the strike appeared to have \u201cseverely damaged or destroyed Syrian aircraft\u201d and reduced their ability to use chemical weapons. Russian authorities disputed the claim, saying many missiles missed their targets. By Friday afternoon the base was already launching flights again, according to AFP. The American ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, said the US \u201ctook a very measured step\u201d but \u201cwe are prepared to do more\u201d, should Assad use chemical weapons again. She added that Iran and Russia bore \u201cheavy responsibility\u201d for the chemical attack, either by allowing Assad to use such weapons or \u201cincompetent\u201d oversight of their ally\u2019s obligations. \u201cThe world is waiting for Russia to reconsider its misplaced alliance with Bashar al-Assad,\u201d she said. \u201cThe United States will no longer wait.\u201d A spokesman for Vladimir Putin said the US had violated international law \u201cunder a false pretext\u201d, and UN deputy ambassador, Vladimir Safronkov, warned \u201cextremely serious\u201d consequences could follow the strike. The prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, said the action was unjustified and \u201ccompletely ruined relations\u201d. Russia\u2019s military announced it would bolster Assad\u2019s air defenses, but it was not clear whether it would cut off the \u201cdeconfliction\u201d hotline it uses to avoid clashes between US and Russian forces. Assad\u2019s office said the strike was \u201cfoolish and irresponsible\u201d and promised to redouble its efforts against rebels.

An unnamed Syrian official told the AP that at least seven people were killed and nine wounded. Jaafari also claimed that the Syrian government had no chemical weapons. Syrian rebels welcomed the strike and called for more. \u201cHitting one airbase is not enough \u2013 there are 26 airbases that target civilians,\u201d a key figure in the Army of Islam faction, Mohamed Alloush, said on Twitter. \u201cThe whole world should save the Syrian people from the clutches of the killer Bashar and his aides.\u201d The US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, said the strikes did not indicate a shift in US policy toward Syria, even though a few days earlier American diplomats had said Assad\u2019s ouster was no longer a priority. The White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, said the strikes had a limited intent \u2013 to deter chemical weapons \u2013 and were of a piece with Trump\u2019s so-called \u201cAmerica first\u201d policy. The UK, Australia, Israel and Saudi Arabia were among the US allies that voiced support for the strikes, while Italy and Japan said they understood the action. The UN coordinator for humanitarian affairs, Jens Laerke, says it had no sign that US military strikes against the Syrian airbase had had \u201cany direct consequence\u201d on overall aid operations in Syria. A UN human rights office spokeswoman, Ravina Shamdasani, said on Friday at a UN briefing that the use of chemical weapons, if confirmed, would amount to a war crime. The airbase attacked on Thursday night by the United States is already launching new flights, according to Agence France-Presse, citing a group that monitors the Syrian civil war. AFP reports: The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said two warplanes \u201ctook off from inside the Shayrat base, which is partially back in service, and struck targets near Palmyra\u201d. The monitor could not specify whether they were Syrian or Russian planes, or what they had bombed. Early on Friday morning, the US military fired 59 Tomahawk missiles at the Shayrat air field in response to a suspected chemical attack this week that has been widely blamed on the Damascus regime. A Syrian military source told AFP that Syria\u2019s armed forces were warned about possible US military action hours before the strike took place. \u201cWe took precautions in more than one military point, including in the Shayrat airbase. We moved a number of airplanes towards other areas,\u201d the source said. US officials said Russia\u2019s military in Syria had been informed of the strike beforehand in order to avoid casualties that could prompt a broader crisis. The US said the missiles targeted radars, aircraft, and air defence systems and destroyed around 20 Syrian planes, but said the runway was intact. Russia\u2019s military said the strike had an \u201cextremely low\u201d military impact, with fewer than half of the 59 missiles reaching the airbase. The Pentagon has confirmed that it alerted Russian military counterparts about the strikes through a hotline, but the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, has said that there was no political contact with the Kremlin. Spicer also told reporters that Trump\u2019s attitude toward Syria had \u201cevolved\u201d over his 78 days in office, especially thanks to the \u201cclear images that were available\u201d and \u201cthat everybody in the world could see\u201d. \u201cIt was very disturbing and tragic and moving to him,\u201d Spicer said. \u201c \u201cHe had a very deliberative process of asking his national security team to develop options.\u201d Spicer insisted that the intent of the actions were limited in scope: a message that Bashar al-Assad \u201cshould abide by the agreement they made not to use chemical weapons\u201d. The press secretary also invoked support from allies to tamp down concern that the missile strikes could further entangle nations in a bloody, chaotic civil war. \u201cIf you\u2019ve seen the response from the world community,\u201d Spicer said, \u201cthey understand that the US acted appropriately and in most cases there is widespread praise from around the globe for the president\u2019s actions.\u201d He said the US strikes did not preclude its willingness to work with Russia on counter-terrorism operations \u2013 though Russia and Syria have described all anti-Assad rebels, whether jihadi or not, as terrorists. \u201cThere can be a shared commitment to defeat Isis and also agree that you can\u2019t gas your own people,\u201d Spicer said. \u201cI think this was a clear response on humanitarian purposes that has been widely praised.\u201d Finally, he said that Trump\u2019s meetings with Xi Jinping were going well. \u201cWe\u2019re in the midst of a very terrific visit.\u201d Missiles were launched during Donald Trump\u2019s dinner with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, has told reporters. At a quick briefing in south Florida, Spicer gave some details of the timeline to the airstrikes, and how they relate to Trump\u2019s policy. The press pool reports: Trump first heard about the gas attack in Syria at his president\u2019s daily briefing on Tuesday at about 10.30am. He asked his team for a range of options. There was another meeting at 8pm on Tuesday at the White House on options and again on Wednesday morning with restricted principals. Trump met again at 3pm on Wednesday and decided to reconvene on Thursday for a decision. On route to Florida on Thursday, at about 1.30pm, he spoke through secured video conference with his team and again at 4pm with [secretary of state] Rex Tillerson and others in a secure room in Palm Beach. That\u2019s when the \u201cpresident gave the OK to move ahead\u201d. Missiles were launched at 7:40pm during dinner. Foreign leaders and members of Congress were told at about 8.30pm, Spicer said, and Trump told Xi about the strikes during dinner. Afterward he met with the secretaries of state and defense and spoke with the joint chiefs, as they discussed what Spicer called an \u201cevolving process\u201d. Although the US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, said that the US was \u201cprepared\u201d to do more strikes, Spicer said the president was \u201cnot going to telegraph his next move\u201d. He insisted that the strikes were \u201cjustified and proportional\u201d, motivated by national security of the region and humanitarian concerns, and that the decision \u201cabsolutely\u201d squares with Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica first\u201d mantra. Bashar Jaafari, Syria\u2019s ambassador to the UN, accuses the US of a \u201cbarbaric and flagrant act\u201d that violates international law. The strikes on a military airfield, he says, lead to \u201ca number of martyrs, including women and children, and wide-ranging material damage\u201d. It remains unclear what damage or casualties were caused by the strikes: the White House has said all 59 missiles hit their targets, while Russian authorities have claimed that fewer than half did. Nevertheless Jaafari says: \u201cThis treacherous act of aggression is a grave violation of the charter of the United Nations as well as all international laws and norms.\u201d He claims \u2013 despite Tuesday\u2019s chemical weapons strikes, the Syrian government\u2019s past stockpiles and the word of US defense officials who said they had watched government planes make the strikes \u2013 that Assad\u2019s government \u201cdoes not have chemical weapons in the first place\u201d. Such claims by the US, Jaafari says, were \u201cattempts to justify it with empty pretexts \u2026 without genuine knowledge of what happened, without identifying whom was responsible\u201d. He then accuses the US of being \u201ca partner of Isil and Jabhat al-Nusra\u201d by way of its support for rebels who oppose Assad\u2019s government. Haley then casts blame on Russia and Iran, saying Bashar al-Assad \u201cwas not the only guilty party\u201d. \u201cThe Iranian government bears a significant responsibility,\u201d she says, for having \u201cpropped up\u201d Assad since the Syrian civil war began in 2011. \u201cThe Russian government also bears considerable responsibility,\u201d she continues. \u201cEvery time Assad has crossed the line of human decency, Russia has stood beside him.\u201d She then denounces Russia for its seven decision to veto resolutions against Assad, and for its threat to veto another, which she says is \u201ccovering up for the Assad regime\u201d. Delay, Haley argues, would create a \u201cwatered-down resolution\u201d that would strengthen Assad. \u201cStrengthening Assad would only lead to murders,\u201d she says. Haley condemns, in particular, Russia\u2019s conduct with regard to Syria\u2019s agreement to destroy its chemical weapons stockpiles. \u201cThat has not happened,\u201d she says. \u201cIt could be that Russia is knowingly allowing chemical weapons.\u201d She offers that Russia\u2019s oversight could be incompetent, or, she says, \u201cit could be that the Assad regime is playing the Russians for fools\u201d. \u201cThe world is waiting for the Russian government to act responsibly in Syria. The world is waiting for Russia to reconsider its misplaced alliance with Bashar al-Assad. The United States will no longer wait,\u201d she says. \u201cThose days are over.\u201d Haley concludes by calling for a move toward a political solution, implying that the US missile strikes should be a sign to Assad and his allies that they must \u201ctake this process seriously, something they have not done\u201d so far. The American ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, says the US \u201ctook a very measured step last night. We are prepared to do more but we hope that will not be necessary.\u201d Speaking in her capacity as ambassador and not as the current head of the security council, Haley condemns Syria \u2013 and Russia and Iran \u2013 for their respective actions in the last six years. The Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, has \u201cterrorized\u201d his country, Haley said, \u201cmurdered hundreds of thousands and displaced millions\u201d. She says Assad has broken international law and \u201cshocked the conscience\u201d of the world. On Tuesday Assad launched \u201cyet another chemical attack, murdering men women and children in the most gruesome way,\u201d Haley says. \u201cAssad did this because he thought he could get away with it. He thought he knew Russia would have his back.\u201d Haley says that changed with the US strike. \u201cWhen the international community fails in its duty to act collectively there are times when states are compelled to take their own action.\u201d The use of chemical weapons against civilians is \u201cone of those times\u201d, she says, and the cause for which \u201cour military destroyed the airfield from which this week\u2019s chemical strikes took place\u201d. \u201cWe were fully justified in doing so. The moral stain of the Assad regime could no longer go unanswered. \u201cHis crimes against humanity could no longer be met with empty words.\u201d \u201cBashar al-Assad must never use chemical weapons again, ever.\u201d The White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, has tweeted several photos of the president, including one during a national security briefing. President Trump sits at the head of the table surrounded by most of the members of his inner circle. Around the table, from left to right, excluding the president himself: his deputy chief of staff, Joe Hagin, senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner, treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, national security adviser, HR McMaster, and chief of staff, Reince Priebus. Seated against the wall are Spicer, chief strategist, Steve Bannon, senior adviser Stephen Miller, national security adviser Michael Anton, deputy national security adviser Dina Powell, and chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn. The photo\u2019s composition has drawn comparisons with the photo taking in the Obama White House in 2011 during the raid that killed Osama Bin Laden. Then vice-president Joe Biden sits at the far left, next to Barack Obama. Then secretary of state Hillary Clinton also sits at the table, with then secretary of defense Robert Gates to her right. Spicer has also tweeted another photo from Trump\u2019s resort at Mar-a-Lago, where the president is meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jingping, and Beijing\u2019s large delegation. At the UN, Russia\u2019s deputy ambassador, Vladimir Safronkov, has angrily told the United States it should halt any military action against the forces of Bashar al-Assad. \u201cWe call on the United States to immediately cease its aggression and to join efforts to make a political solution in Syria, and to work together to combat the terrorist threat,\u201d Safronkov said. \u201cWe strongly condemn the illegitimate actions by the US. The consequences of this for regional and international stability could be extremely serious,\u201d he added. The ambassador said that he had heard \u201cmany insulting words\u201d about Russia\u2019s use of its veto rights on the UN security council, and defended Russia\u2019s conduct. \u201cWe use it only in such circumstances in which you, you try in the UN security council, to impose your irresponsible geopolitical projects.\u201d Safronkov also said that the council must pay attention to airstrikes, by the US-led coalition against Isis in Mosul, Iraq, that had killed dozens of civilians. \u201cThe Mosul tragedy must be publicised, people must know about it,\u201d Safronkov said. \u201cNothing was said about Mosul.\u201d \u201cWe do not want to draw attention away from Syria,\u201d he added. Last night, the US launched a missile strike against Syria for the first time since the civil war began, targeting an airbase from which the US said this week\u2019s chemical weapons attack on civilians was launched by Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime. The strikes targeted Shayrat airbase near Homs. The US has said this was the location from which Syrian forces had launched a chemical attack on the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhun on Tuesday morning. The Pentagon said 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles were launched from the warships USS Ross and Porter in the eastern Mediterranean in the early hours of Friday morning, local time. A Syrian official told the Associated Press that at least seven people were killed and nine wounded in the US missile attack. Reuters reported that the Syrian state news agency said the strikes killed nine civilians, including four children, in areas near the targeted airbase. The death toll has not been independently verified. Some reports said senior officers had evacuated the base before the airstrikes happened and after foreign countries were notified of an imminent attack by the US. President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s office said the strike was \u201cfoolish and irresponsible\u201d and \u201crevealed its short-sightedness and political and military blindness to reality\u201d. It said the government would redouble its efforts against rebel groups after the strike, adding: \u201cThe disgraceful act of targeting a sovereign state\u2019s airport demonstrates once again that different administrations do not change deeper policies.\u201d Syrian rebels welcomed the strike and called for additional action. \u201cHitting one airbase is not enough \u2013 there are 26 airbases that target civilians,\u201d a key figure in the Army of Islam faction, Mohamed Alloush, said on Twitter. \u201cThe whole world should save the Syrian people from the clutches of the killer Bashar [al-Assad] and his aides.\u201d Russia, a Syria ally that has been helping the Assad regime target rebel-held districts, condemned the US action. Vladimir Putin\u2019s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said the president regarded the strikes as \u201caggression against a sovereign state in violation of international law, and under a false pretext\u201d. Peskov said Trump\u2019s move would have consequences for relations between the two countries. \u201cWith this step Washington has struck a significant blow to Russian-American relations, which were already in a sorry state.\u201d A Russian defence ministry statement read on state television said the US attack had been \u201cineffective\u201d and claimed Syrian authorities were looking for 36 Tomahawk missiles that fell outside the base and missed the target. The statement also confirmed Russia would stop cooperation and communication with US forces in Syria. Shortly thereafter, the Russian military said it would help Syria strengthen its air defences after the strike to help \u201cprotect the most sensitive Syrian infrastructure facilities\u201d. In a post on Facebook, the Russian prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, wrote about \u201ccompletely ruined relations\u201d between Russia and the US, saying the US strike was \u201cgood news for terrorists\u201d. The US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, said the strikes did not indicate a shift in US policy towards Syria, despite it being a significant change from the previous stance taken by the Trump administration. Tillerson said Russia bore responsibility for its handling of the 2013 deal that was supposed to remove Assad\u2019s stockpile of chemical weapons. The Pentagon confirmed Russia had been told in advance of the strike through military channels, despite earlier claims from Tillerson that there had been no contact. Hillary Clinton called for the US to \u201ctake out\u201d Syrian government-controlled airfields just hours before Trump launched airstrikes. The move was supported by key US allies, including the UK, Australia, Israel and Saudi Arabia. Italy and Japan said they understood the action taken by the US. The UK defence secretary, Michael Fallon, said the British government was not asked to provide military support to the US attack but believed it was a \u201cwholly appropriate\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re not committed to military action against Syria. Our parliament considered that before, back in 2013, and turned it down,\u201d he said. Iran, Assad\u2019s regional backer, said it \u201cstrongly condemned\u201d the strikes, as it condemned \u201call unilateral military action\u201d. It said the action was taken under the \u201cpretext\u201d of the chemical strike. Bahram Ghasemi, Tehran\u2019s foreign ministry spokesman, said the attack \u201cstrengthens the near-to-death terrorists and complicates the situation in Syria and the whole region\u201d. The UN coordinator for humanitarian affairs, Jens Laerke, says it had no sign that US military strikes against the Syrian airbase had had \u201cany direct consequence\u201d on overall aid operations in Syria. A UN human rights office spokeswoman, Ravina Shamdasani, said on Friday at a UN briefing that use of chemical weapons, if confirmed, would amount to a war crime. The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, has appealed to parties involved in the Syrian conflict for restraint to avoid adding to the suffering of Syria\u2019s people. Nato\u2019s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said Assad \u201cbears full responsibility\u201d for the US airstrikes against an airbase in Syria. The European commission said Jean-Claude Juncker \u201cunderstands efforts to deter future attacks\u201d and that the EU stood ready to play its role in finding a political solution to the crisis. The Syrian Observatory on Human Rights said airstrikes may have struck Khan Sheikhun on Friday. The UN security council has met to discuss the US strikes. Britain\u2019s UN ambassador, Matthew Rycroft, said Assad has been \u201cput on notice\u201d, describing the strike as a \u201cproportionate response to unspeakable acts\u201d. France\u2019s UN ambassador, Fran\u00e7ois Delattre, said Assad\u2019s goal was \u201cannihilation, quite simply, of all those who resist him, whatever the price might be\u201d. The French UN ambassador, Fran\u00e7ois Delattre, has told the UN security council that Assad\u2019s goal is \u201cannihilation, quite simply, of all those who resist him, whatever the price might be\u201d. He described the US strike as legitimate as it had become \u201cessential to deter\u201d Assad. The leader of one of Europe\u2019s oldest human rights bodies is facing growing criticism over a surprise meeting last month with Bashar al-Assad. Pedro Agramunt, a Spanish centre-right politician who is president of the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe (Pace), caused consternation at the Strasbourg-based organisation when it was reported that he and other lawmakers had paid an unexpected visit to Syria last month. Agramunt and several European parliamentarians had met Assad accompanied by a Russian delegation led by the Duma deputy Leonid Slutsky. According to the Russian state news agency Tass, 10 European parliamentarians were present on the trip, which took place on 20 March. Diplomats and MPs from several countries were already unhappy about the visit even before this week\u2019s chemical attack by the Assad regime. Now pressure on the Spanish politician is mounting. \u201cAn increasing number of members of the assembly, political groups and national delegations are expressing their concern and criticism,\u201d the Socialist party has said in a recent statement. \u201cIt is urgent that Pace reiterates its condemnation of war crimes and killing of civilians and dissociates from any initiative which can weaken its capacity and credibility of acting as strong advocate for human rights.\u201d The group said it had written to Agramunt asking for \u201curgent and public clarification about the role of Pace in this story \u2026 but, unfortunately, this clarification has not been made\u201d. French parliamentarians have also written to Agramunt demanding an explanation by the next session, which begins on 24 April. The Council of Europe was established in 1949 to safeguard democracy and human rights on the continent. Parliamentarians from 47 countries meet four times a year in the parliamentary assembly in Strasbourg, though Russia has not returned to the assembly following its suspension in 2014 in response to the annexation of Crimea. Tass had described Agramunt as Pace president, though officials at the Council of Europe have insisted he was not making an official visit. Agramunt\u2019s \u201cinitiative does not commit the Council of Europe in any way\u201d, said a spokesman. The office of the Pace president had not immediately responded to the Guardian\u2019s request for comment when this blog post was published. Trump\u2019s airstrike is a convenient U-turn from a president who can\u2019t be trusted, writes Jonathan Freedland. Britain\u2019s UN ambassador, Matthew Rycroft, has said Assad has been \u201cput on notice\u201d by the US airstrike, describing it as a \u201cproportionate response to unspeakable acts\u201d. \u201cWithout Russia\u2019s seven vetoes in the security council, defying the views of other members of this council, Assad would have faced sanctions and justice,\u201d Rycroft told the 15-member council. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said he supported the \u201cstrong and clear message\u201d sent by the US airstrike. The Israeli military said it had been informed in advance of the strike. \u201cIn both word and action, President Trump sent a strong and clear message today that the use and spread of chemical weapons will not be tolerated,\u201d a statement from Netanyahu\u2019s office said. \u201cIsrael fully supports President Trump\u2019s decision and hopes that this message of resolve in the face of the Assad regime\u2019s horrific actions will resonate not only in Damascus, but in Tehran, Pyongyang and elsewhere.\u201d Hours after those remarks, the US vice-president, Mike Pence, called the Israeli premier and thanked him in Trump\u2019s name for the Israeli support of the US attack in Syria, Netanyahu\u2019s office said. Pence had also \u201cupdated Netanyahu on the details of the attack and its outcome\u201d, it said. \u201cNetanyahu reiterated the need to prevent the distribution and use of chemical weapons,\u201d his office said. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, appeared in the House of Commons in Ottawa on Friday, saying the US attack on Syria was \u201cnecessary\u201d, writes Julien Gignac. \u201cIn the face of heinous war crimes, all civilised peoples must speak with one voice,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is why Canada fully supports in the United States\u2019 limited, focused action to degrade the Assad regime\u2019s ability to launch such attacks.\u201d An ongoing push for diplomatic efforts was asserted. \u201cWe know that long-term solutions for Syria have to go by way of diplomacy,\u201d he said. Trudeau said he had spoken with Donald Trump on Friday morning, emphasising \u201cthat Canada agrees that Assad\u2019s repeated use of chemical weapons must not continue\u201d. Trudeau stated that he had been informed of the US offensive about an hour in advance. \u201cWe emphasised that we certainly believe that the Assad regime needs to be held to account against its civilians, particularly the use of chemical weapons against children and innocents, and further degrading their capacity to continue such attacks is in the interest of the entire international community and the path to peace for Syria,\u201d he said. This photo was taken immediately after the US airstrike, and shows Trump receiving a briefing on Syria from his national security team while in Mar-a-Lago. In a post on Facebook, the Russian prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, has written about \u201ccompletely ruined relations\u201d between Russia and the US. He said: That\u2019s it. The last remaining election fog has lifted. Instead of an overworked statement about a joint fight against the biggest enemy, Isis (Islamic State), the Trump administration proved that it will fiercely fight the legitimate Syrian government, in a tough contradiction with international law and without UN approval, in violation of its own procedures stipulating that the Congress must first be notified of any military operation unrelated to aggression against the US. On the verge of a military clash with Russia. Nobody is overestimating the value of pre-election promises, but there must be limits of decency. Beyond that is absolute mistrust. Which is really sad for our now completely ruined relations. And which is good news for terrorists. One more thing. This military action is a clear indication of the US president\u2019s extreme dependency on the opinion of the Washington establishment, the one that the new president strongly criticised in his inauguration speech. Soon after his victory, I noted that everything would depend on how soon Trump\u2019s election promises would be broken by the existing power machine. It took only two and a half months. Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the UN, has said the US had insisted that the emergency meeting of the UN security council be held in the open so that \u201cany country that chooses to defend the atrocities of the Syrian regime will have to do in full public view, for all the world to hear\u201d. Muhammed AlRuru, 35, from Khan Sheikhun, told Mona Mahmood: I live almost 200m west of where the chemical attack took place. I saw a yellow cloud when I was releasing my sheep. I ran first to the basement, but after 10 minutes I and other locals headed to find out if there were any victims. I saw my cousin, Usama, lying on the floor. I threw some water on him and stopped one of the cars to take him to a makeshift medical spot. It seems that Usama went to check on his brother\u2019s family but he inhaled some gas and collapsed. My children were also affected \u2013 they were vomiting and their eyes were red, but they are OK. I kept going to the site with other locals searching for survivors. The situation is difficult here, there are some moments when we envy those who had died especially when the warplanes show on the skies. The kids are terrified, and we can\u2019t do anything. After the attack, I took part in burying more than 28 victims. I do not find it easy to go back again to the bereaved site, it is very painful to walk among the relatives of the victims who are busy checking who is dead or who is still alive. It is a human disaster by all means and we do not know when the machine of death in Syria will stop. Mustafa Muhammed Ieed al-Azreq, 30, from Khan Sheikhun, told the Guardian\u2019s Mona Mahmood about Tuesday\u2019s attack. He said: I\u2019m a maths teacher at a high school in Khan Sheikhun. I was sleeping at home when I heard a sound of a warplane and then four bangs. I ran to the roof to see what was going on. I saw that the attack was almost 300m from where I live. I ran down to check the website that we, locals of Khan Sheikhun, have set up to warn each other of any possible arial attack. The page started to warn people not to go nearby the site of the attack to avoid inhaling the poisonous gas. The situation was terrible, but still I could not stop myself running inside attacked houses, breaking the doors and taking out the victims with some other volunteers. When I broke into one of the houses, I saw a guy was lying unconscious on stairs, some others in the centre of the house. We took them out but I myself inhaled some of the poisonous gas, the smoke was above our head and we were full of grief at the horrible scenes. We started to suck the poison out of the victims by mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, to help save their lives. I did that procedure with three victims till I myself started to feel dizzy and my head was spinning. I evacuated seven kids, by chance one of them was still alive and breathing. His name is Mustafa al-Khalid, 15. I felt the pulse in his hand while all the other seven member of his family had died in the house. I put him in my own car and took him to the nearest medical centre where I myself fainted later. I have my son, my two brothers and parents living with me, they all went to another village to escape the gas. The warplanes are still hovering on Khan Sheikhun where you can smell only death. It is a death without blood. Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah has said the US airstrikes in Syria are a \u201cfoolish\u201d move that will lead to serious regional tensions. Hezbollah, which supports Assad, said in a statement the strike would not demoralise the Syrian army or negatively affect its allies. It added the US military action was a \u201cservice\u201d to Israel and its \u201cambitions in the region\u201d. Donald Trump has jumped into a quagmire with his eyes shut, writes Richard Wolffe. It may be hard to believe, but Donald Trump is even more simplistic than George W Bush in matters of war. George W Bush enjoyed all the certainty of a very simple man: you were either with us or against us, good or evil, marching for democracy or plotting terrorist attacks. The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, has appealed to parties involved in the Syrian conflict for restraint to avoid adding to the suffering of Syria\u2019s people. \u201cMindful of the risk of escalation, I appeal for restraint to avoid any acts that could deepen the suffering of the Syrian people,\u201d he said in a statement. US lawmakers from both parties have backed the airstrikes on Syria and urged Trump to spell out a broader strategy for dealing with the conflict. \u201cI am hopeful these strikes will convince the Assad regime that such actions should never be repeated,\u201d said Senator Mark Warner, Virginia Democrat. But Warner, who said he had been briefed on the strikes by the director of national intelligence, Dan Coats, urged Trump, a Republican, to lay out his plans for the multi-sided Syria conflict. \u201cPresident Trump has said repeatedly that his objective in Syria is to defeat [Islamic State militants]. Last night\u2019s strike was aimed at a different objective,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cPresident Trump needs to articulate a coherent strategy for dealing with this complex conflict, because the consequences of a misstep are grave.\u201d The armed services committee chairman, Senator John McCain, who has long called for more aggressive action against Assad, told MSNBC: \u201cThe signal I think that was sent last night ... was a very, very important one.\u201d But the Arizona Republican also said: \u201cDespite all the enthusiasm we see this morning, if I might quote Churchill, it\u2019s the end of the beginning not the beginning of the end.\u201d Trump, McCain added, should be \u201cprepared to take other action\u201d, including establishing safe zones within Syria and further arming and training of anti-Assad rebels. Several lawmakers said Trump should seek the approval of Congress if he decides to take additional military action in Syria. Senator Marco Rubio, Florida Republican, said the strikes in Syria could send a message to other US adversaries such as North Korea. \u201cI think the time has come for some of these countries to be worried about us a little bit, not us always worried about what they might do,\u201d Rubio told Fox News. Donald Trump and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, are meeting for a second day at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate as planned on Friday, AP reports. Their first-night summit dinner wrapped up shortly before the US announced the missile barrage on an airbase in Syria on Thursday night. The chair of the United Nations Association UK has questioned the wisdom of the US hit on Shayrat airbase. Stewart Wood said: \u201cIt\u2019s unclear how US airstrikes will make civilians safer.\u201d In a blog post, Lord Wood of Anfield wrote: \u201cUnilateral action without broad international backing through the UN, without a clear strategy for safeguarding civilians, and through military escalation risks further deepening and exacerbating an already protracted and horrific conflict, leaving civilians at greater, not lesser, risk of atrocities.\u201d He added that by circumventing the UN \u201cwe reduce both legitimacy and effectiveness, as a course of action that does not have the broad support of regional powers and the international community, channelled through UN systems and processes, can have little chance of success in leading to a more stable Syria\u201d. The situation in Syria \u201camounts to an international armed conflict\u201d following the US airstrike on a Syrian airbase, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has said. Iolanda Jaquemet, its spokeswoman, said: \u201cAny military operation by a state on the territory of another without the consent of the other amounts to an international armed conflict. So according to available information [about] the US attack on Syrian military infrastructure, the situation amounts to an international armed conflict.\u201d ICRC officials were raising the attack with US authorities as part of ongoing confidential dialogue with parties to the conflict, she added. The UN security council will meet at 4.30pm UK time to discuss US strikes in Syria, according to Reuters. The Free Syrian Army has released a statement welcoming the US airstrikes in Syria but has warned the US \u201cresponsibility is still big and does not end with this operation\u201d, Reuters reports. The rebel group said it was afraid of acts of revenge against civilians by Assad and his allies and said military operations targeting airbases and banned weapons should continue. There has been more support for Trump\u2019s airstrikes in Syria, this time from Canada and Jordan. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said in a statement: \u201cCanada fully supports the United States\u2019 limited and focused action to degrade the Assad regime\u2019s ability to launch chemical weapons attacks against innocent civilians, including many children. \u201cPresident Assad\u2019s use of chemical weapons and the crimes the Syrian regime has committed against its own people cannot be ignored.\u201d The Jordanian state news agency, Petra, reported that the Jordanian administration said the US missile strike was \u201cnecessary and appropriate\u201d. The leader of the Liberal Democrats, Tim Farron, has backed the US airstrikes in Syria in a piece for the Guardian. It starts: I am in no doubt that what will end the war in Syria is what ultimately ends every conflict: words and diplomacy, not weapons. But when diplomacy fails and civilians suffer, as they have been doing for many years in Syria, and when they are the victim of weapons that have been outlawed by the international community for their horrific and indiscriminate consequences, then we cannot shy away from proportionate military intervention. Here\u2019s a roundup of global reaction to the US airstrikes in Syria: The office of the Syrian president has called the US strike against one of its airbases in central Homs \u201creckless\u201d and \u201cirresponsible\u201d, AP reports. The statement on Friday said the strikes were \u201cshortsighted\u201d and reflect a continuation of policy regardless of which administration that is based on targeting and \u201csubjugating people\u201d. It added that the dawn attack was not based on facts. Vladimir Putin has held a meeting of the security council to discuss the Russian response. \u201cThe participants expressed deep concern at the inevitable negative consequences of these aggressive actions for the joint efforts to fight terrorism,\u201d said spokesman Dmitry Peskov. He said the security council also expressed regret at the harm the strike would do to US-Russian relations, and they discussed ways to continue the Russian air force operation in Syria to give support to Assad\u2019s army. The Russian military has said it would help Syria strengthen its air defences after the US strike on a Syrian airbase, AP reports. A Russian defence ministry spokesman, Maj Gen Igor Konashenkov, said that a \u201ccomplex of measures\u201d to strengthen Syrian air defences would be done shortly to help \u201cprotect the most sensitive Syrian infrastructure facilities\u201d. Konashenkov said \u201cthe combat efficiency of the US strike was very low\u201d, adding that only 23 of the 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles had reached Shayrat airbase in the province of Homs. He said the attack had destroyed six MiG-23 fighter jets of the Syrian air force which were under repairs but didn\u2019t damage other Syrian warplanes at the base. Konashenkov added that the base\u2019s runway also had been left undamaged. The UN coordinator for humanitarian affairs says it has no sign that US military strikes against a Syrian airbase have had \u201cany direct consequence\u201d on overall aid operations in Syria, AP reports. Jens Laerke, of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said such violence \u201cis not a new feature\u201d of Syria\u2019s war, and cited continued UN-led efforts to reach people in besieged and hard-to-reach areas of the country. The US launched cruise missile strikes against Shayrat airbase in Homs province following a chemical attack in a northern village that US officials and others have blamed on Assad forces. Ravina Shamdasani, a UN human rights office spokeswoman, said on Friday at a UN briefing that use of chemical weapons, if confirmed, would amount to a war crime. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, \u201cbears full responsibility\u201d for the US airstrikes against an airbase in Syria, Reuters reports. Stoltenberg added: \u201cAny use of chemical weapons is unacceptable, cannot go unanswered, and those responsible must be held accountable.\u201d Stoltenberg was told by the US defense secretary that the airstrikes would go ahead. Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the Labour party, has broken his silence over the US missile strikes in Syria. He said: The US missile attack on a Syrian government airbase risks escalating the war in Syria still further. Tuesday\u2019s horrific chemical attack was a war crime which requires urgent independent UN investigation and those responsible must be held to account. But unilateral military action without legal authorisation or independent verification risks intensifying a multi-sided conflict that has already killed hundreds of thousands of people. What is needed instead is to urgently reconvene the Geneva peace talks and unrelenting international pressure for a negotiated settlement of the conflict. The terrible suffering of the Syrian people must be brought to an end as soon as possible and every intervention must be judged on what contribution it makes to that outcome. The British government should urge restraint on the Trump administration and throw its weight behind peace negotiations and a comprehensive political settlement. The European commission head, Jean Claude Juncker, responded that \u201che understands efforts to deter future attacks\u201d and that the EU stood ready to play its role in finding a political solution to the crisis. A statement for the European commission president said: A horrific chemical weapons attack on civilians struck Khan Sheikhun on 4 April. Last night, in response, the US launched airstrikes on Shayrat airfield. The US has informed the EU that these strikes were limited and seek to deter further chemical weapons atrocities. President Juncker has been unequivocal in his condemnation of the use of chemical weapons. The repeated use of such weapons must be answered. He understands efforts to deter further attacks. There is a clear distinction between airstrikes on military targets and the use of chemical weapons against civilians. Efforts to stem the spiral of violence in Syria and work towards a lasting peace should be redoubled. Only a political transition can lead to such an outcome. President Juncker and the European commission as a whole stand ready to play their part in full. The UK\u2019s foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, appears to be taking a wait-and-see approach to the US president\u2019s decision to launch the airstrike. Emerging from talks with the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, on Friday morning, Johnson avoided making any comment, with one aide telling reporters he was \u201cdeparting immediately\u201d for Britain. Johnson had preferred to stick to the issues of Brexit, Cyprus and Turkey during his discussions with the Greek leader, officials in Athens told the Guardian. A spokeswoman for Number 10 and the UK defence secretary, Michael Fallon, have said they supported the strikes, adding they were \u201cappropriate\u201d. A warplane on Friday bombed the Syrian town of Khan Sheikhun, where a chemical attack killed scores of people earlier this week and prompted US missile strikes, a witness in the rebel-held area and a war monitoring group has said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based organisation that monitors the war, said a Syrian government or Russian warplane hit Khan Sheikhun, in rebel-held Idlib province, before noon local time. The Syrian army and the Russian defence ministry could not immediately be reached for comment. The witness, an activist working with an air raid warning service in opposition areas, said the jet struck at about 11am (0800 GMT) at the northern edge of the town, causing damage but no known casualties. The US fired dozens of cruise missiles on Friday at an airfield from which it said the Khan Sheikhun chemical attack that killed at least 70 people had been launched on Tuesday. Washington blamed the gas attack on Syrian government forces. The Syrian government strongly denies responsibility and said it had not used chemical weapons. The observatory and the witness said earlier this week that the aircraft which they accused of carrying out the suspected gas attack had flown out of Shayrat airbase. The Syrian army said the missile attack on its airbase killed six people and caused extensive damage, describing it as a \u201cblatant aggression\u201d. Reuters is reporting that the Syrian state news agency has said that US airstrikes killed nine civilians, including four children, in areas near the targeted airbase. Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, will hold a meeting of his security council later on Friday to discuss the US missile strikes on Syria, the Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters. Russia has suspended its Syria air safety agreement with the United States following the missile strikes, Reuters reports. Peskov said Russia would keep technical and military channels of communication open with Washington but would not exchange any information through them. \u201cIn light of the missile strikes, risks [of collisions between Russian and US aircraft] are significantly higher,\u201d the spokesman told reporters. The strikes were carried out in the interests of Islamic State and other radical groups operating in Syria, Peskov added. A Russian defence ministry statement read on state television said the US attack had been \u201cineffective\u201d and claimed Syrian authorities were looking for 36 Tomahawk missiles which fell outside the base and missed the target. The statement also confirmed that Russia would stop cooperation and communication with US forces in Syria. The Russian state news reporter Evgeny Poddubny is at the base and posted a video of the damage on his Instagram account. He also wrote that his \u201cpreliminary information\u201d at the base was that nine jets were destroyed in the strike. Airstrikes may have struck the Syrian town of Khan Sheikhun on Friday, where a chemical attack killed scores of people this week, according to a witness in the rebel-held area and a war monitoring group, the Syrian Observatory on Human Rights. Iran, Assad\u2019s staunch regional backer, was quick to condemn the US strike on Syria\u2019s Shayrat airbase, saying it violated international law and risked complicating the conflict further. Tehran authorities also questioned claims that Assad was behind the chemical attack on Khan Sheikhun. \u201cThe Islamic Republic of Iran, as the biggest victim of chemical weapons in the contemporary history, condemns all uses of chemical weapons regardless of their users or victims, and at the same time considers any unilateral measure with this excuse as dangerous, destructive, and violating of the imperative principles of the international law,\u201d said Bahram Ghasemi, Tehran\u2019s foreign ministry spokesman, according to the semi-official Mehr news agency. \u201cWe believe that the American missile attack on Shayrat airbase in Syria launched from US warships, with the excuse of the mysterious chemical attack on Khan Sheikhun, Idlib, whose time, executers and beneficiaries are shrouded in mystery, strengthens the near-to-death terrorists and complicates the situation in Syria and the whole region,\u201d he added. Russia 24 TV has shown images of damage at Shayrat airbase, which was targeted by the US airstrike. Here are some screengrabs shown on BBC News: The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, who is in Tashkent, said it appears there were no Russian servicemen killed in the missile strikes. He also compared the action to the 2003 invasion of Iraq but said \u201cat least that time they tried to bring some evidence forward\u201d. Other politicians in Russia are lining up to condemn the US airstrike, with many claiming the news of the chemical attack was a \u201cfake\u201d in order to provide a pretext for military action. Hillary Clinton had called for the US to take out Syrian government-controlled airfields just hours before Donald Trump launched airstrikes against Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime, PA reports. Speaking in her first public interview since losing the US election in November, Clinton said Assad\u2019s aerial power had been the key component behind widespread civilian deaths since the start of the civil war in 2011. President Trump authorised the launchof cruise missiles in the early hours of Friday morning on a Syrian airbase thought to be behind this week\u2019s chemical weapons attack. Speaking to the New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof, Clinton said she believed the US had been wrong not to have previously launched such an offensive. She said: \u201cAssad had an air force, and that air force is the cause of most of the civilian deaths, as we have seen over the years and as we saw again in the last few days. \u201cAnd I really believe that we should have and still should take out his airfields and prevent him from being able to use them to bomb innocent people and drop Sarin gas on them.\u201d Angelino Alfano, the Italian foreign minister, said in a statement that Italy understood the reasons behind US military action and called the strikes a \u201cproportionate\u201d deterrent to the further use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime. Alfano called for a \u201cnecessary and urgent\u201d meeting of the UN security council \u2013 where Italy, a non-permanent member, currently has a vote \u2013 and the adoption of a consensus resolution to prevent further atrocities. He also pointed to Rex Tillerson\u2019s upcoming visit to Moscow, suggesting that the US secretary of state could encourage Russia to use its influence in Syria and with Assad to agree \u201ca real ceasefire, full humanitarian access and a gradual building of trust between the Syrian parties\u201d. Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said he supported Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cresolve\u201d against the use and proliferation of chemical weapons. \u201cWe understand that the action taken by the United States was designed to prevent the situation [in Syria] from worsening,\u201d Kyodo News quoted Abe as saying after a meeting of Japan\u2019s national security council. Abe described Tuesday\u2019s chemical weapons attack on Syrian civilians as \u201cextremely inhumane\u201d, adding that he appreciated Trump\u2019s attempts to address threats to global security, including North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile programmes. Syria aside, Abe said \u201cthe threat from weapons of mass destruction is also growing more serious in east Asia\u201d. He added: \u201cJapan will coordinate with the United States and the rest of the international community and play its proper role in global peace and stability.\u201d China\u2019s Global Times, a nationalist Communist party-controlled tabloid that sometimes reflects official views, has published an online editorial criticising Trump\u2019s strikes against Syria. The newspaper said the attack was likely to spark conflict between the US and Russia and \u201ctook place despite no definitive results from the investigation by an international organisation, and was carried out in the absence of a UN security council resolution\u201d. \u201cTrump\u2019s decision to attack the Assad government is a show of force from the US president,\u201d it added. \u201cHe wants to prove that he dares to do what Obama dared not. He wants to prove to the world that he is no \u2018businessman president\u2019 and that he will use US military force without hesitation when he considers it necessary.\u201d \u201cThis is Trump\u2019s first major move in international affairs, and it leaves an impression that the decision was made in haste,\u201d the newspaper added. \u201cThe Syrian civil war is entering a new phase. More refugees will flee the region and Europe may have to pay the price.\u201d A Syrian official has told the Associated Press that at least seven were killed and nine were wounded in US missile attack on airbase. Syrian rebels on Friday welcomed a US strike on a government airbase and called for additional action, with one powerful faction saying a single strike was not enough, AFP reports. \u201cHitting one airbase is not enough, there are 26 airbases that target civilians,\u201d a key figure in the Army of Islam faction, Mohamed Alloush, said on Twitter. \u201cThe whole world should save the Syrian people from the clutches of the killer Bashar [al-Assad] and his aides.\u201d Other rebel groups welcomed the US strike and called for continued military action against the regime. \u201cThe American strike against the killing tools used by Bashar al-Assad is the first step on the correct path to combating terrorism and we hope it will continue,\u201d said Issam Raes, spokesman for the Southern Front rebel faction. \u201cIn my opinion, the message is political, and the message has arrived to Russia and been understood.\u201d Colonel Ahmed Osman, of the Turkey-backed Sultan Murad rebel group, said: \u201cWe welcome any action that will put an end to the regime that is committing the worst crimes in history.\u201d Mohamed Bayrakdar, another leader of the Army of Islam, which operates mainly around the capital Damascus, described the strike as \u201ca bold and correct step\u201d. \u201cWe welcome any response to the crimes of the regime,\u201d he told AFP. The US has launched a missile strike against Syria, targeting al-Shayrat airbase close to Homs, from where it said this week\u2019s sarin nerve gas attack on Khan Sheikhun was launched. Fifty-nine Tomahawk cruise missiles were launched from warships USS Ross and USS Porter in the eastern Mediterranean in the early hours of Friday morning. Reports from Homs province said the airbase was destroyed, and six people killed. Some reports said senior officers had evacuated the base before the airstrikes happened. Donald Trump (read his full comments here) said the strike was a direct response to the chemical weapons attack that killed more than 70 people: It is in this vital national security interest of the United States to prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons. There was an angry response in Russia, where the Kremlin warned that the strikes were a \u201csignificant blow to Russian-American relations, which were already in a sorry state\u201d. Moscow called for a meeting of the UN security council to discuss the strikes. Tillerson said Russia bore responsibility for its handling of the 2013 deal that was supposed to remove Assad\u2019s chemical weapons stockpile: Either Russia has been complicit or Russia has been simply incompetent in its ability to deliver on its end of that agreement. Tillerson said there had been \u201cno discussions\u201d with Moscow before the strike. But the Pentagon confirmed that Russia \u2013 a key Assad ally \u2013 had been informed in advance of the strike through military channels: Russian forces were notified in advance of the strike using the established deconfliction line. Sources told the Guardian that US intelligence officials believe Russian personnel were at al-Shayrat airbase when sarin was loaded on to a Syrian jet. They have not established whether the Russians knew it was happening. The UK, Australia, Israel, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, New Zealand and Japan offered strong backing for the US strikes, while Iran condemned the move. France and Germany confirmed they had been informed in advance of the attack, though China warned it opposed the use of force. Read our latest news story here: I\u2019m now handing over the live blog to my colleague Jamie Grierson, who will continue to bring you the latest developments. France was among the countries informed by the US ahead of the strikes, the French foreign minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, said. \u201cI was told by Rex Tillerson during the night,\u201d Ayrault said, calling the missile strike \u201ca warning [to] a criminal regime\u201d. The office of the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, issued a statement confirming he had spoken with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel: The president and the German chancellor held talks on the telephone this morning on the situation in Syria. Following the chemical massacre on April 4 in Khan Sheikhun in the north-west of Syria, a military installation of the Syrian regime used for chemical bombing was destroyed last night by US strikes. We have been informed. Assad bears full responsibility for this development. Its continued use of chemical weapons and mass crimes can not go unpunished \u2026 France and Germany therefore continue their efforts with partners in the United Nations framework to sanction the most appropriate criminal acts related to the use of chemical weapons banned by all treaties. We call on the international community to come together for a political transition in Syria, in accordance with resolution 2254 of the security council and the Geneva communiqu\u00e9. Sources have told the Guardian that US intelligence officials believe Russian personnel were at al-Shayrat airbase when sarin was loaded on to a Syrian jet. They have not established whether the Russians knew it was happening. The base covers an area of more than 8 sq km and has two runways and dozens of buildings, silos and storage facilities. Syrian opposition figures claim to have identified the pilot allegedly responsible for bombing Khan Sheikhun at about 6.30am on 4 April. Five hours later, close to 11.30am, a hospital treating victims from the attack was hit by a conventional bomb, dropped from a jet. The sources say that on both occasions, a Russian Sukhoi was monitored by ground radar and aerial reconnaissance flying over the town. Flashes were picked up on the ground, indicating that ordnance had been dropped. The air space over northern Syria is monitored heavily by Turkey, the US and Russia, and all three have precise knowledge of whose jets are in the air and where they fly. New Zealand has joined the list of nations backing the airstrikes, with prime minister Bill English saying the US action was supported by NZ. Foreign minister Murray McCully said: It is becoming clear that Syrian government forces were responsible for the outrageous attacks where chemical weapons were used. These events are horrific. It is critical that the international community emphatically demand an end to this violence, and that the Syrian government be held to account. In the absence of an adequate response from the United Nations security council, we can understand why the United States has taken targeted unilateral action to try and prevent further such attacks by the Syrian regime. Russia (which, along with China, has vetoed previous UN resolutions against Assad) has called for a meeting of the UN security council to discuss the US strikes: Russia also says it is suspending its agreement to communicate with the US over the use of Syrian airspace \u2013 possibly a reference to the so-called \u201cdeconfliction line\u201d, via which the US military gave Russia warning on Thursday of the missile strikes (more on that here): China, which has repeatedly blocked UN resolutions against Assad, has now issued its official response to the US strikes on Syria. Speaking at a press conference in Beijing, the foreign ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, stopped short of explicitly condemning the US airstrikes but said China had always been opposed to the \u201cuse of force\u201d. Hua said China also opposed \u201cthe use of chemical weapons by any country, organisation or individual, in any circumstance and for any purpose\u201d. There was now an urgent need to prevent a \u201cfurther deterioration\u201d of the situation in Syria, Hua added. With the UK, Australia, Israel, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Japan offering strong backing for the US strikes, Indonesia has given a more cautious response. Foreign ministry spokesman Armanatha Nasir told Reuters via text message that Indonesia strongly condemned the use of chemical weapons in Syria but added: At the same time, Indonesia is concerned with unilateral actions by any parties, including the use of Tomahawk missiles, in responding to the chemical weapon attack tragedy in Syria. Fallon ruled out UK military intervention in Syria: We\u2019ve all got to work much harder. We\u2019re not committed to military action against Syria. Our parliament considered that before, back in 2013, and turned it down. But we are involved in trying to get a political settlement in Syria and we will all be working harder to do that now. He called on Russia to use its influence to bring violence in Syria to an end. The UK defence secretary Michael Fallon has told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: Our reaction is we fully support what the Americans have done. It\u2019s limited; it\u2019s wholly appropriate. Fallon said the UK was not asked by the Americans to \u201cget involved\u201d in any action against the Assad regime. James Mattis, Fallon\u2019s US counterpart, made it clear it was a US operation, he said. Fallon said the US \u201chas not declared war\u201d on Syria: The Americans have made it clear the attack last night was limited. But he said the \u201cmessage\u201d the UK government took from the action was that if Assad used chemical weapons again, the Americans would respond again. Reuters reports a statement from the Syrian army, which says the missile strikes killed six people and caused \u201cbig material losses\u201d. The army accuses the US of \u201cblatant aggression\u201d against the airbase, and says its response will be to continue to \u201ccrush terrorism\u201d and restore \u201cpeace and security to all Syria\u201d. Japan has become the latest country to offer backing for the US strikes against the Syrian airbase, joining the UK, Australia, Israel, Turkey and Saudi Arabia. The Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said the nerve gas attack earlier this week justified the retaliation: Many innocent people became victims from the chemical attacks. The international community was shocked by the tragedy that left many young children among the victims. Japan supports the US government\u2019s determination to prevent the spread and use of chemical weapons. Communication between the US and Russia ahead of the strikes took place via the so-called \u201cdeconfliction line\u201d, which is controlled by the US military and operates out of the al-Udeid airbase in Qatar. It is used typically to protect pilots from both countries as they fly sorties over Syria, Associated Press reports, to ensure they do not attack each other, and to avoid the possibility of midair collisions. Pentagon spokesman Captain Jeff Davis said the Russians were informed of the imminent strikes in \u201cmultiple conversations\u201d through the deconfliction line on Thursday. As the missiles were launched from two US warships in the Mediterranean, Donald Trump was in Florida, where he has been hosting the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, at his Mar-a-Lago resort. After news broke of the strike, Trump broke off from the meeting (and a dinner of steak and carrots) to address reporters on the military action. Initial plans for a live televised address to the nation reportedly had to be scrapped due to technical difficulties of broadcasting from the resort. Here are Trump\u2019s remarks in full: My fellow Americans, On Tuesday, Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad launched a horrible chemical weapons attack on innocent civilians using a deadly nerve agent. Assad choked out the lives of innocent men, women and children. It was a slow and brutal death for so many. Even beautiful babies were cruelly murdered in this very barbaric attack. No child of god should ever suffer such horror. Tonight I ordered a targeted military strike on the airfield in Syria from where the chemical attack was launched. It is in this vital national security interest of the United States to prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons. There can be no dispute that Syria used banned chemical weapons, violated its obligations under the chemical weapons convention, and ignored the urging of the UN security council. Years of previous attempts at changing Assad\u2019s behaviour have all failed and failed very dramatically. As a result the refugee crisis continues to deepen and the region continues to destabilise, threatening the United States and its allies. Tonight I call on all civilised nations to join us in seeking to end the slaughter and bloodshed in Syria, and also to end terrorism of all kinds and all types. We ask for God\u2019s wisdom as we face the challenge of our very troubled world. We pray for the lives of the wounded and for the souls of those who have passed. And we hope that as long as America stands for justice that peace and harmony will in the end prevail. Goodnight and god bless America and the entire world. Thank you. While Moscow has labelled the strikes \u201can aggression\u201d and warned that they were \u201ca significant blow to Russian-American relations, which were already in a sorry state\u201d, the US earlier caused confusion with conflicting messages over whether Russia had been informed in advance about the attack on the airbase. Secretary of state Rex Tillerson told reporters at Mar-a-Lago that it had not: There were no discussions or prior contacts, nor had there been any since the attack with Moscow. But the Pentagon said Russia had been alerted in advance, through military channels. Pentagon spokesman Captain Jeff Davis said the Russians were informed in \u201cmultiple conversations\u201d on Thursday, through the \u201cdeconfliction channel\u201d \u2013 a communications channel to the Russian base at Latakia used to avoid collisions or exchanges of fire between US and allied planes and Russian planes: There are Russians at the base and we took extraordinary precautions to not target the area where the Russians are. This will raise many questions, says Guardian US national security editor Spencer Ackerman: The Russians are sure to have routed that warning to Assad, raising immediate questions about what the strike will have accomplished. The Kremlin has made its first comment, with Vladimir Putin\u2019s spokesman Dmitry Peskov making an angry statement. Peskov said Putin sees the strikes on Syria as \u201caggression against a sovereign state in violation of international law, and under a false pretext\u201d. Peskov claimed Syria has no chemical weapons, and that the destruction of them has been monitored by international observers. He said Trump\u2019s move would have consequences for the relationship between the two countries. \u201cWith this step Washington has struck a significant blow to Russian-American relations, which were already in a sorry state,\u201d said Peskov. No word yet on any concrete response, though. Catch up with our coverage of the US strikes against Syria here: US strikes Syrian airfield in first direct military action against Assad A dinner of steak and carrots, then Trump\u2019s cruise missiles struck Syria Moustafa Bayoumi: Trump\u2019s senseless Syria strikes accomplish nothing Tomahawk missile: weapon of deadly precision comes back to fore in Syria The US has launched a missile strike against Syria, targeting al-Shayrat airbase close to Homs, from where it said this week\u2019s sarin nerve gas attack on Khan Sheikhun was launched. The Pentagon said 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles were launched from warships USS Ross and Porter in the eastern Mediterranean in the early hours of Friday morning, Syria time. Unconfirmed reports from Homs province said the airbase was destroyed, and some personnel killed. Some reports said senior officers had evacuated the base before the airstrikes happened. Donald Trump said the strike was a direct response to the chemical weapons attack that killed more than 70 people: Tonight I ordered a targeted military strike on the airfield in Syria from where the chemical attack was launched. It is in this vital national security interest of the United States to prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons. There can be no dispute that Syria used banned chemical weapons, violated its obligations under the chemical weapons convention, and ignored the urging of the UN security council. Years of previous attempts at changing Assad\u2019s behaviour have all failed and failed very dramatically. US secretary of state Rex Tillerson said the strike did not indicate a shift in US policy towards Syria, despite its significant shift from the previous stance taken by the Trump administration. There was an angry response in Russia, where the Kremlin warned that the strikes would cause \u201csignificant damage to US-Russia ties\u201d. Tillerson said Russia bore responsibility for its handling of the 2013 deal that was supposed to remove Assad\u2019s chemical weapons stockpile: They would act as the guarantor that these weapons would no longer be present in Syria. Clearly Russia has failed in its responsibility to deliver on that commitment from 2013. Either Russia has been complicit or Russia has been simply incompetent in its ability to deliver on its end of that agreement. Tillerson said there had been \u201cno discussions\u201d with Moscow before or since the strike. But the Pentagon confirmed that Russia \u2013 a key Assad ally \u2013 had been informed in advance of the strike through military channels: Russian forces were notified in advance of the strike using the established deconfliction line. The Pentagon also said it believes the strike has \u201cseverely damaged or destroyed Syrian aircraft and support infrastructure\u201d. Support for the US action came from the UK, Australia, Israel, Turkey and Saudi Arabia, while Iran condemned the strikes. Read our latest news story here: The Turkish deputy prime minister, Numan Kurtulmu\u015f, has backed the US strikes. Speaking on Turkish Fox TV, Kurtulmu\u015f said he hoped the operation would contribute to achieving peace in Syria, and said the international community needed to maintain pressure on Assad. In its first public response to the airstrikes, the Kremlin has issued a strong statement condemning the US move as \u201caggression against a sovereign nation\u201d. Moscow said the strikes had been carried out on an \u201cinvented pretext\u201d and claimed the Syrian army did not have chemical weapons. The strikes, it said, would do \u201csignificant damage to US-Russia ties\u201d and created a \u201cserious obstacle\u201d to creating an international coalition to defeat Isis. Russian president Vladimir Putin, the Kremlin said, views the strikes as an attempt to deflect world attention from civilian deaths in Iraq \u2013 where at least 150 people died in a series of coalition airstrikes in Mosul last month. Iran has condemned the US missile strike on Syria, Associated Press reports: Foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Ghasemi said the \u201cunilateral action is dangerous, destructive and violates the principles of international law\u201d, in a report carried Friday by the semi-official ISNA news agency. Iran is one of the biggest supporters of Assad and its hardline paramilitary Revolutionary Guard is deeply involved in the war. Ghasemi described Iran as \u201cthe biggest victim of chemical weapons in recent history\u201d, referencing Iraqi use of the weapons during its 1980s war. He said Iran condemned the missile launch \u201cregardless of the perpetrators and the victims\u201d of Tuesday\u2019s chemical weapons attack in Syria. He also warned it would \u201cstrengthen terrorists\u201d and further add to \u201cthe complexity of the situation in Syria and the region\u201d. In addition, Shaun Walker reports, there\u2019s a big round of diplomacy ahead in Russia next week: US secretary of state Rex Tillerson is due in Moscow on Wednesday and is expected to meet with foreign minister Sergei Lavrov and president Vladimir Putin. Boris Johnson is in Moscow on Monday and will meet Lavrov. The Guardian\u2019s Moscow correspondent reports: The Russian foreign ministry has said it will make a statement soon on the US action. There has been a lot of negative comment so far, comparing Trump\u2019s move to previous US incursions in the Middle East, but little concrete information about the potential consequences, as people wait for a signal from the Kremlin on how Russia is going to play this. The Pentagon has said there were \u201cmultiple conversations\u201d with Russia before the strike, and that \u201cextraordinary precautions\u201d were taken not to target Russians at the base, but we are also yet to hear anything from either the Kremlin or military HQ on how these discussions looked from Moscow. A report on the state news said the US had launched the attack after \u201cbaseless\u201d claims that Assad had used chemical weapons. Senator Viktor Ozerov said Trump was \u201cfollowing in the footsteps of Bush Jr who looked for chemical weapons in Iraq, and we all know how that worked out\u201d. Alexei Pushkov, a Russian senator and former top foreign policy official, wrote on Twitter shortly before the US missiles were launched: In the 21st century, every US president has had a war in the Middle East, if not two. If Trump goes into Syria, he\u2019ll sit alongside Bush and Obama. Vladimir Safronkov, Russia\u2019s deputy UN ambassador, said: The authors of these plans should stop and think what military operations in Iraq, Libya, and other countries led to. All the consequences will be on the conscience of those who came up with these plans. Britain, too, has issued a show of support for the US action against Syria. A Downing Street spokeswoman said: The UK government fully supports the US action, which we believe was an appropriate response to the barbaric chemical weapons attack launched by the Syrian regime, and is intended to deter further attacks. Australia\u2019s prime minister Malcolm Turnbull has said he \u201cstrongly supports\u201d the US military strike on Syria\u2019s al-Shayrat airfield, calling it a calibrated, proportionate and targeted response to the Syrian regime\u2019s \u201cshocking war crime\u201d. He said Australia was in close discussions with its allies about the next steps, but said the airstrike had sent an important signal that the world would not tolerate the use of chemical weapons. In a specially-convened press conference in Sydney on Friday, Turnbull said: It sends a strong message to the Assad regime. The retribution has been proportionate and it has been swift. We support the United States in that swift action. Turnbull said it was important to note that the international community was not at war with the Assad regime, and the US had made it clear it was not seeking to overthrow Bashar al-Assad. However, he said events of this week raised \u201cvery real questions\u201d over whether Assad could remain as leader of Syria: This chemical attack was a horrific crime, shocking, even in the context of that brutal war. Turnbull said the US had not asked for more military support, but he left open the possibility of providing it in the future: There is no question that this shocking conflict in Syria is crying out itself for a resolution and we certainly will continue to work with our allies and our partners to see a resolution to this shocking war. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an organisation that monitors the war, says al-Shayrat airbase has been almost completely destroyed. There are reports that some troops have been killed, but this is as yet unconfirmed. A mainstay of US warfare for more than 20 years, the Tomahawk cruise missile had been considered the most likely weapon for any strike by the Trump administration against the Syrian military. And so it proved. The US launched its surprise attack on an inland airbase near Homs early on Thursday morning, with 59 of the missiles deployed from two naval destroyers. USS Ross and USS Porter were in the eastern Mediterranean sea off Syria\u2019s western coast. More than 6.25m long (20ft) and weighing 1,590kg (3,500lb), the Tomahawk land-attack missile is billed by the US navy as \u201can all-weather, long range, subsonic cruise missile\u201d able to be launched from either ships or submarines. They commonly carry warheads of up to 454kg (1,000lb), and are designed to fly at low altitudes towards even heavily defended land targets with extreme accuracy. Their chief advantage in warfare is that they are unmanned, guided by GPS to targets more than 1,600km (1,000 miles) away at high subsonic speeds of 885km/h (550mph). Russia is waking up to news of the strike \u2013 though we know military channels were used to alert Moscow before the missiles were launched \u2013 and reaction so far has been hostile. State news agency RIA quoted Viktor Ozerov, head of the defence and security committee at the Russian upper house of parliament, saying the US strikes could undermine the fight against terrorism. Ozerov said Russia would call for an urgent meeting of the UN security council: This [the attack] could be viewed as an act of aggression of the US against a UN nation. The Guardian\u2019s Middle East correspondent reports from Beirut: The al-Shayrat air base has been central to the Syrian war and to persistent claims of chemical weapons use. It is one of Bashar al-Assad\u2019s main military institutions and has housed allies including Russian troops, Hezbollah and Iraqi militias throughout the war. Sources in Lebanon who are allied to the regime said senior officers evacuated the base before the airstrikes happened and some commanders were attempting to move their families to the Lebanese capital. The US strike had been increasingly anticipated from late on Thursday until early Friday morning, when 59 precision guided missiles were launched from two US destroyers in the Mediterranean. Russia has retained a presence at al-Shayrat, although its most significant force is located at a purpose-built base close to Latakia. There was no immediate response from Hezbollah, whose forces have been central to turning the tide of the war in Assad\u2019s favour over the past two years, most recently in Hama, where they have helped rebuff an assault near Syria\u2019s fourth city led by jihadists and opposition groups. Russia has established a comprehensive ground-radar bubble over much of northern Syria, which would have been capable of detecting incoming threats, such as the pre-dawn barrage of missiles. Before the war, al-Shayrat was one of Assad\u2019s strategic bases. Located near where large stores of sarin were kept in bunkers, it has maintained that role even as most of the stockpiles were surrendered in late 2013. Since then, there have been several claims of sarin use and extensive claims that chlorine has been strapped to war planes and helicopters and dropped on opposition fighters and communities. Associated Press cites Talal Barazi, governor of Homs province, where al-Shayrat airbase is located, saying there have been deaths as a result of the strikes. At the moment, there are no further details. Pentagon spokesman Captain Jeff Davis said the Russians were informed in \u201cmultiple conversations\u201d on Thursday, through the \u201cdeconfliction channel\u201d \u2013 a communications channel to the Russian base at Latakia used to avoid collisions or exchanges of fire between US and allied planes and Russian planes. \u201cThere are Russians at the base and we took extraordinary precautions to not target the area where the Russians are,\u201d he said. The US defense department has released images of its two guided-missile destroyers, USS Porter and USS Ross, stationed in the Mediterranean, unleashing the missile strike on Syria. AP reports that the Syrian Coalition, an opposition group, has welcomed the US attack, saying it puts an end to an age of \u201cimpunity\u201d and should be just the beginning. Major Jamil al-Saleh, a US-backed rebel commander whose Hama district was struck by a suspected chemical weapons attack, said he hoped the US attack on a government air base would be a \u201cturning point\u201d in the six-year war. Talal Barazi, governor of Syria\u2019s Homs province, where al-Shayrat airbase is located, has told state TV that such strikes serve the purpose of terrorists, Reuters reports: Syrian leadership and Syrian policy will not change. This targeting was not the first and I don\u2019t believe it will be the last \u2026 The armed terrorist groups and Daesh [Isis] failed to target the Syrian Arab Army and Russian military positions. The US strikes \u201ctargeted military positions in Syria and in Homs specifically\u201d in order to \u201cserve the goals of terrorism in Syria and the goals of Israel in the long run\u201d, Barazi said. (The Syrian government describes all armed groups opposed to it as terrorists.) Barazi said there are not thought to be \u201cbig human casualties\u201d at the airbase, though there is material damage as a result of the strikes. He said firefighting and rescue operations had been continuing for more than two hours. And he insisted that the airbase \u2013 which the US said was the site from which the sarin nerve gas attack on Khan Sheikhun was launched \u2013 was used to support Syrian regime operations against Isis. Secretary of state Rex Tillerson has insisted that the missile strikes \u2013 despite the sharp shift they represent from the previous stance taken by the Trump administration \u2013 are not in fact a change in US policy towards Syria: This clearly indicates the president is willing to take decisive action when called for. I would not in any way attempt to extrapolate that to a change in our policy or posture relative to our military activities in Syria today. There has been no change in that status. I think it does demonstrate that President Trump is willing to act when governments and actors cross the line and cross the line on violating commitments they\u2019ve made and cross the line in the most heinous of ways. The US has launched a missile strike against Syria, targeting al-Shayrat airbase close to Homs, from where it said this week\u2019s sarin nerve gas attack on Khan Sheikhun was launched. The Pentagon said 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles were launched from warships USS Ross and Porter in the eastern Mediterranean on Thursday at 8.45ET (Friday 3.45am Syria). Donald Trump said the strike was a direct response to the chemical weapons attack that killed more than 70 people: Tonight I ordered a targeted military strike on the airfield in Syria from where the chemical attack was launched. It is in this vital national security interest of the United States to prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons. There can be no dispute that Syria used banned chemical weapons, violated its obligations under the chemical weapons convention, and ignored the urging of the UN security council. Years of previous attempts at changing Assad\u2019s behaviour have all failed and failed very dramatically. US secretary of state Rex Tillerson said Russia bore responsibility for its handling of the 2013 deal that was supposed to remove Assad\u2019s chemical weapons stockpile: They would act as the guarantor that these weapons would no longer be present in Syria. Clearly Russia has failed in its responsibility to deliver on that commitment from 2013. Either Russia has been complicit or Russia has been simply incompetent in its ability to deliver on its end of that agreement. Tillerson said there had been \u201cno discussions\u201d with Moscow before or since the strike. But the Pentagon confirmed that Russia \u2013 a key Assad ally \u2013 had been informed in advance of the strike through military channels: Russian forces were notified in advance of the strike using the established deconfliction line. The Pentagon also said it believes the strike has \u201cseverely damaged or destroyed Syrian aircraft and support infrastructure\u201d. Read our latest news story here: Contradicting information from the Pentagon \u2013 which said \u201cRussian forces were notified in advance of the strike using the established deconfliction line\u201d \u2013 secretary of state Rex Tillerson told reporters that Russia had not been alerted: There were no discussions or prior contacts, nor had there been any since the attack with Moscow. The contradiction could be explained if Tillerson is referring to political channels, and the Pentagon military ones. Israel\u2019s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has also lent his backing to the strike: Though Trump had neither congressional nor international authorisation for the strike, prominent US politicians immediately lent him political cover. House speaker Paul Ryan called the strike \u201cappropriate and just\u201d: Earlier this week the Assad regime murdered dozens of innocent men, women, and children in a barbaric chemical weapons attack. Tonight the United States responded. This action was appropriate and just. These tactical strikes make clear that the Assad regime can no longer count on American inaction as it carries out atrocities against the Syrian people. Resolving the years-long crisis in Syria is a complex task, but Bashar al-Assad must be held accountable and his enablers must be persuaded to change course. I look forward to the administration further engaging Congress in this effort. The missile strikes drew mixed reaction on Capitol Hill. Some welcomed what they saw as long overdue action against the human rights abuses of the Assad regime, while others were troubled by the lack of congressional authorisation. In a joint statement, senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham welcomed Trump\u2019s actions as sending \u201can important message the United States will no longer stand idly by as Assad, aided and abetted by Putin\u2019s Russia, slaughters innocent Syrians with chemical weapons and barrel bombs\u201d. The two prominent hawks saw Thursday\u2019s action as a \u201ccredible first step\u201d and urged a \u201cnew comprehensive strategy\u201d in the region starting with taking Assad\u2019s air force \u201cout of the fight\u201d. In contrast, Senator Rand Paul, who has long been skeptical of military intervention, expressed his scepticism and demanded a congressional vote: While we all condemn the atrocities in Syria, the US was not attacked. The President needs congressional authorisation for military action and I call on him to come to Congress for a proper debate on our role. Our prior interventions in this region have done nothing to make us safer and Syria will be no different. Democrats struck a more unified tone and emphasised the need for congressional approval. Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the Senate foreign relations committee, said in a statement: Any longer-term or larger military operation in Syria by the Trump administration will need to be done in consultation with the Congress \u2026 It is the president\u2019s responsibility to inform the legislative branch and the American people about his larger policy in Syria, as well as the legal basis for this action and any additional military activities in that country. This was echoed in far more strident terms by Ted Lieu, a Democratic congressman from California, who proclaimed the move \u201cillegal\u201d: In Florida, national security adviser HR McMaster has told reporters that Trump was given three options for retaliation against Syria following the chemical weapons attack. McMaster says the president told advisers to focus on two of those options, and made the final decision on Thursday. Tillerson says the strikes show that Trump is \u201cprepared to take decisive action to respond to heinous acts\u201d. Pentagon spokesman Captain Jeff Davis said the Shayrat airbase had been used to store chemical weapons used by the regime until 2013, when a deal was struck with the US and Russia to remove its declared arsenal. Davis said it was used to deliver the chemical weapons dropped on Khan Sheikhun on Tuesday, but could not confirm whether any chemical weapons were still at the site. However, he stressed that the targets were chosen carefully to avoid the risk of hitting those weapons: This was a place that prior to 2013 was one of their main chemical weapons storage sites. A lot of those sites were dismantled at the time as they were seeking to comply, but they obviously began using them again for that purpose. The things that were targeted were not where we assessed chemical weapons were. The places we targeted were the things that made the airfield operate. It\u2019s the petroleum facilities, it\u2019s the aircraft radar, what they use for takeoff and landing, as well as air-defence radar. It\u2019s the sites that are specific to making it operate, as well as hangars and aircraft themselves. Here\u2019s the full statement from the Pentagon about the strike. Key points: Russia was alerted in advance. 59 Tomahawk land attack missiles (TLAM) were launched from two US warships, USS Porter and USS Ross, in the Mediterranean. Targets at the al-Shayrat airbase included aircraft, shelters, ammunition supplies, fuel storage and radars. The US believes the strike has \u201cseverely damaged or destroyed Syrian aircraft and support infrastructure\u201d. The Pentagon has confirmed it used a hotline for minimising the risk of aerial combat between US and Russian jets in eastern Syria to alert Russia of the strike against its Syrian client. The Russians are sure to have routed that warning to Assad, raising immediate questions about what the strike will have accomplished, and also signalling that the US does not seek escalation. Pentagon spokesman Captain Jeff Davis said: Russian forces were notified in advance of the strike using the established deconfliction line. US military planners took precautions to minimise risk to Russian or Syrian personnel located at the airfield. We are assessing the results of the strike. Initial indications are that this strike has severely damaged or destroyed Syrian aircraft and support infrastructure and equipment at Shayrat airfield, reducing the Syrian government\u2019s ability to deliver chemical weapons. The use of chemical weapons against innocent people will not be tolerated. Tillerson tells reporters that the strike was \u201cproportionate\u201d and the US has a \u201chigh degree of confidence\u201d that sarin gas was used in this week\u2019s attack in Idlib. US secretary of state Rex Tillerson and national security adviser HR McMaster are also now briefing reporters at Mar-a-Lago shortly; they were in Florida to consult with Trump ahead of the strike. Tillerson says Russia has failed to carry out its responsibilities under the 2013 agreement designed to rid Assad of his chemical weapons stocks. He says Moscow was \u201ceither complicit or incompetent\u201d in its handling of the deal. Here\u2019s the Trump speech \u2013 you can read the comments in full a little further down this blog here: Florida Senator Marco Rubio has also welcomed the strike. In a statement, he said: I salute the bravery and skill of the men and women of our armed forces who conducted this mission. Tonight\u2019s strike against the Assad regime\u2019s Shayrat airbase will hopefully diminish his capacity to commit atrocities against innocent civilians. By acting decisively against the very facility from which Assad launched his murderous chemical weapons attack, President Trump has made it clear to Assad and those who empower him that the days of committing war crimes with impunity are over. What must follow is a real and comprehensive strategy to ensure that Assad is no longer a threat to his people and to US security, and that Russia no longer has free rein to support his regime. Here are the full remarks made by the president to reporters in Florida: My fellow Americans, On Tuesday, Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad launched a horrible chemical weapons attack on innocent civilians using a deadly nerve agent. Assad choked out the lives of innocent men, women and children. It was a slow and brutal death for so many. Even beautiful babies were cruelly murdered in this very barbaric attack. No child of god should ever suffer such horror. Tonight I ordered a targeted military strike on the airfield in Syria from where the chemical attack was launched. It is in this vital national security interest of the United States to prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons. There can be no dispute that Syria used banned chemical weapons, violated its obligations under the chemical weapons convention, and ignored the urging of the UN security council. Years of previous attempts at changing Assad\u2019s behaviour have all failed and failed very dramatically. As a result the refugee crisis continues to deepen and the region continues to destabilise, threatening the United States and its allies. Tonight I call on all civilised nations to join us in seeking to end the slaughter and bloodshed in Syria, and also to end terrorism of all kinds and all types. We ask for god\u2019s wisdom as we face the challenge of our very troubled world. We pray for the lives of the wounded and for the souls of those who have passed. And we hope that as long as America stands for justice that peace and harmony will in the end prevail. Goodnight and god bless America and the entire world. Thank you. Syrian state TV has responded \u2013 albeit without much detail \u2013 to the US strike. According to Reuters, state TV has reported: American aggression targets Syrian military targets with a number of missiles. Donald Trump is speaking to reporters at Mar-a-Lago. He says Assad used deadly nerve gas to kill many Syrians. Tonight he ordered a \u201ctargeted military strike\u201d on the airfield from which that chemical weapons attack was launched. These strikes were, he said, in the \u201cvital national security interest\u201d of the US. He said he was calling on all \u201ccivilised nations\u201d to stop the slaughter and bloodshed in Syria. The US military has launched a cruise missile volley at Syrian airfields, making the US a direct combatant for the first time against Bashar al-Assad. Donald Trump, who for years signalled comfort with leaving Assad in power, abruptly switched course after seeing images of children gassed to death in Idlib province after Assad unleashed sarin gas in his latest chemical weapons attack. The strike comprised dozens of Tomahawk cruise missiles launched from the guided-missile destroyers USS Ross and Porter in the eastern Mediterranean. An airfield near Homs was targeted, signalling a limited initial engagement. The US did not target Syria\u2019s formidable air defences, as it does before a concerted airpower campaign. Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham, both armed services committee hawks who have been sharply critical of Trump even as they have long sought an attack on Assad, praised Trump on Thursday evening. In a joint statement, they said: We salute the skill and professionalism of the US armed forces who carried out tonight\u2019s strikes in Syria. Acting on the orders of their commander-in-chief, they have sent an important message: the United States will no longer stand idly by as Assad, aided and abetted by Putin\u2019s Russia, slaughters innocent Syrians with chemical weapons and barrel bombs. Tomahawks are sophisticated missiles with the ability to shift course in the air, making them analogous to drones on a one-way mission. Syria\u2019s formidable, Russian-supplied air defences, largely along the Mediterranean coast, have long prompted warnings from US military officials against attacking Assad. CNN reports that the missile launches took place around an hour ago, at 8.45 ET \u2013 that would have been 3.45am in Syria. The targets at the military airbase included runways, aircraft and fuel points. The map shows al-Shayrat airfield, a Syrian military site close to Homs, which was targeted by around 60 US Tomahawk missiles. It\u2019s currently Friday 4.30am in Syria. It is not yet clear precisely what time the strikes were carried out. Donald Trump is expected to address the nation shortly. We\u2019ll cover that live here. It\u2019s currently 9.30pm in Florida, where the president is hosting his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, at his Mar-a-Lago resort. Earlier, en route to Florida, Trump had been vague about his intentions. He told reporters on Air Force One: I think what happened in Syria is a disgrace to humanity, and he\u2019s there, and I guess he\u2019s running things, so something should happen. Associated Press has more details on the strike. It says the US has attacked a Syrian airbase using around 60 cruise missiles. US officials said the Tomahawk missiles were fired from two warships in the Mediterranean Sea, targeting the Syrian government-controlled airbase. The move came after Trump held meetings with the secretary of defense, James Mattis, and national security adviser HR McMaster at Mar-a-Lago in Florida, where the president is currently hosting his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping. Simultaneously, the joint chiefs were briefed at the Pentagon for several hours on Thursday. As my colleagues Spencer Ackerman and Julian Borger report: Senior US military commanders have long sounded warnings over involving the US in Syria\u2019s grueling, multifaceted civil war, but the Pentagon is now said to be considering a range of options for standoff missile strikes against Assad regime targets. Discussions are likely to center on whether the strikes would be punitive and limited \u2013 to destroy specific aircraft, airstrips or chemical weapons infrastructure \u2013 or the beginning of a broader campaign to oust a ruler whom only days ago the Trump administration was prepared to leave in power. It is further unclear what, if any, US planning exists for a post-Assad Syria should the US seek to oust Assad and inherit a fractious, violent country. News is breaking that the US has launched missile strikes against Syria. NBC News reports that strikes were launched on al-Shayrat airfield, a Syrian military site close to Homs. Reports from NBC and CNN say more than 50 Tomahawk missiles were fired. This follows an apparent change of heart by Donald Trump over action in Syria, sparked by Tuesday\u2019s chemical weapons attack in Idlib that killed more than 70 people. We will be following developments here on the live blog as they unfold. For crucial background, Kareem Shaheen has this exclusive on-the-ground report on conditions at the site of the attack, Khan Sheikhun.",

          "bodyText": "Chris Bowen has emphatically rejected the idea that Labor will take a \u201cBuffett rule\u201d to the next election and he says progressive political parties need to balance the need to pursue redistributive policies with the need to boost economic growth. In a wide-ranging interview on Guardian Australia\u2019s politics live podcast, the shadow treasurer delivers a comprehensive thumbs-down to the idea that wealthy Australians would be forced to pay a minimum rate of tax, declaring the Buffett proposal is not a rule but a concept, \u201cbecause no country has done it\u201d. \u201cIt is actually the Buffett concept because no country has done it, it is not the law of the land anywhere, and no progressive party has it as its policy,\u201d Bowen says. \u201cIt\u2019s a concept, an idea.\u201d He argues a Buffett rule is too blunt a policy instrument and could create a number of unintended consequences, such as harming the fundraising prospects of philanthropic foundations or impacting negatively on angel funding and venture capital \u2013 and he insists it \u201cwon\u2019t be part of the policy we take to the next election\u201d. The emphatic nature of Bowen\u2019s response won\u2019t go down well in some quarters of the ALP, with a number of up-and-coming leftwingers, and the former treasurer Wayne Swan, a prominent rightwinger, declaring that Labor must seriously consider the merits of a Buffett rule as part of tax policy for the next federal election. Proponents of the change say Bowen agreed during the last Labor national conference to properly consider the proposal and he has subsequently refused to do that. The shadow treasurer neglects to note in his remarks that the Australian Greens last year adopted the Buffett rule as policy. The interview with Bowen followed a blunt declaration at the National Press Club by the new Australian Council of Trade Unions national secretary, Sally McManus, that neoliberalism had run its course \u2013 and a disavowal of liberal economics by the former Labor prime minister Paul Keating after the McManus address. The podcast conversation with the shadow treasurer considered the guiding principles progressives are bringing to economic policy development after the global financial crisis, the rise of the inclusive growth and inequality agenda, and the disavowal of neoliberalism by some prominent progressives. Bowen says in the interview he has focused during the past term in opposition on pursuing policies that are both assertively progressive and redistributive, such as Labor\u2019s proposed negative gearing and capital gains tax reforms. He says Labor will pursue other redistributive measures and there will be more to say between now and the next federal election. But in a message for internal consumption, Bowen warns it is important for the opposition to resist adopting \u201cvery blunt instruments\u201d to deliver progressive and redistributive outcomes. He says he exercised care in the development of the negative gearing and capital gains tax policies to keep the policy sharp and the unintended consequences to a minimum. Bowen says what Labor did during the past term of opposition \u201chas to be the model for what comes next\u201d. He says his message to progressive people who have grown tired of the status quo and want to achieve a fairer system is \u201cwork with us to deliver it\u201d. The shadow treasurer also argues the economic policy conversation in progressive politics needs to remain focused on economic growth as well as redistribution. \u201cIt\u2019s not all about redistribution,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to grow the pie and care how the pie is distributed.\u201d Bowen says the contemporary growth agenda is different from the orthodoxy that prevailed in the Hawke/Keating years. He says boosting growth now requires a more active role by governments. \u201cGrowth is not about the retreat of government, it is about governments intervening,\u201d Bowen says. He says Keating\u2019s commentary \u2013 in which the former prime minister said liberal economics had run into a dead end and had \u201cno answer to the contemporary malaise\u201d \u2013 needs to be understood in the context of the contemporary progressive agenda for economic growth. Bowen says Keating\u2019s reasoning is that opening up the Australian economy in the 1980s had been important and necessary \u201cbut there comes a point where you build on that by saying there\u2019s got to be a dividend for the nation, and there has got to be government involvement\u201d. He says it is important to acknowledge that the reforms kicked off by Hawke and Keating had delivered an extraordinary run of uninterrupted economic growth but had also fuelled societal inequality. As well as outlining his economic policy thinking, Bowen also argues progressive parties such as the ALP had to engage in a \u201cvalues debate\u201d and not vacate the field to rightwing populists. He says parties of the centre-left need to tell voters \u201cour answer is investing in you, not engaging in populism\u201d. \u201cIt is not about going back and making Australia great again,\u201d Bowen says, borrowing Donald Trump\u2019s campaign slogan from the US presidential race. \u201cI think there\u2019s an important opportunity for progressive parties because people are craving a values debate. They are saying we no longer want a choice about who is the most efficient technocrat or who is the best insider. \u201cPeople want to talk about what sort of country we want.\u201d He says rightwing populism has gained a foothold because \u201cthe person who presents the answer is the one who gets the public support, even if it\u2019s not the right answer. So Donald Trump has an answer. It\u2019s the wrong answer, but he has an answer.\u201d He says Labor\u2019s message has to be no retreat, and the pitch has to be inclusive and cognisant of the fact that inequality is at a 75-year high. International evidence supports the idea that progressive political leaders can prosper if they are prepared to articulate a cultural agenda as well as an economic one, he says. Bowen points to the victory of Justin Trudeau in Canada and the solid performance of the centrist independent, Emmanuel Macron, in the presidential race in France. \u201cOur values tell us we should be a modern, multicultural, outward-looking, sophisticated country which invests in people and brings people with us. \u201cI think we can win that values debate.\u201d",

          "body": "<p>Opposite a bleak government building in suburban Ottawa, Canada, a barebones \u201ccannabis clinic\u201d \u2013 with just a cash register, jeweller\u2019s scales and a glass counter \u2013 is doing a brisk trade. \u201cPirate! Muslim! Gangster! Yes! We all smoke!\u201d shouts one teen as he high-fives the owner, Rohmi. He pockets his pungent bag and bounces out, giggling.</p> <p>On the wall, there\u2019s a menu listing today\u2019s special: moonrocks \u2013 buds rolled in cannabis oil then dipped in powdered hash at C$40 (\u00a324) a gram. There are cans of Canna Cola; potent, weed-laced gummy bears; a mound of gooey hashish smelling of dark chocolate, hops and pine resin.</p> <p>If this is medicine, it\u2019s unclear what the illness is, other than sobriety. It makes an Amsterdam coffeeshop look tame \u2013 and it\u2019s this free-for-all, wild-west-of-weed attitude that Canada\u2019s government wants to tame by legalising cannabis during prime minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s first term in office. Laws that will legalise cannabis for recreational use will be announced in the week of 10 April, and <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/liberal-legal-marijuana-pot-1.4041902\">will be passed by July 2018</a>, say government sources, making Canada the first G7 country to do so.</p> <p>Globally, cannabis prohibition is being briskly dismantled, a wave of decriminalisation or legalisation sweeping south through the Americas, with states such as Colorado leading the way. California voted to legalise recreational use in November 2016. The US currently has 29 states offering legal medical marijuana and eight states with legal recreational cannabis markets. Countries including Uruguay, Mexico, Jamaica, Brazil, Colombia and <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/chile-opens-latin-america-s-largest-medical-marijuana-farm-n500301\">Chile</a> are either creating legal markets for medicinal cannabis or relaxing rules on possession and cultivation. In the EU, Germany is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/19/german-mps-vote-to-legalise-cannabis-for-medicinal-purposes\">preparing for imminent full medicinal legalisation</a>, and the Republic of Ireland voted in December 2016 to allow medical use. In the UK, medical marijuana is available in the form of a tincture spray, Sativex, but access is severely limited.</p> <p>What is different about Canada\u2019s plans to legalise is the scope of the law change \u2013 it will be legal, nationally, for anyone over the age of 18 to use cannabis for pleasure next year.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/news-video/video-trudeau-says-ottawa-wont-legalize-illicit-drugs-other-than-marijuana/article34199290/?utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_medium=Referrer:+Social+Network+/+Media&amp;utm_campaign=Shared+We\">Trudeau told journalists early this month</a> that he wanted to seize the profits of the criminalised market and use the income to help those with drug problems. But his main aim in legalising the drug was to make it harder for children to get hold of it, arguing that alcohol laws showed that proper controls and regulations work. \u201cIt\u2019s easier for a teenager to buy a joint right now than a bottle of beer, and it\u2019s not right,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know by controlling and regulating it, we are going to make it more difficult for young people to access marijuana.\u201d</p> <p>The evidence is on his side: in Colorado, where cannabis has been legal since 2014, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/12/21/one-of-the-greatest-fears-about-legalizing-marijuana-has-so-far-failed-to-happen/?utm_term=.98fa8c0f2f2b\">teen use has fallen by about 12%</a>, due to a combination of factors including a smaller black market and better drugs education.</p> <p>Ironically, however, the upcoming change in Canada has prompted a huge growth in outlaw dispensaries. Rohmi and hundreds of other dealers selling in kerbside clinics are claiming to be operating under rules allowing Canadians to use cannabis to treat complaints as diverse as insomnia, ADHD and chronic pain. In reality, they are cashing in and riding the pre-legalisation green rush.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/crime/2017/03/10/prince-and-princess-of-pot-released-on-bail.html\">Police are clamping down</a>, with dozens of raids in recent weeks, but the mood on the streets and in the clinics is one of delighted anarchy, with some outfits simply reopening the day after a raid in a new spot.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"15c866f4eeb63c60bf7e86815b6ba61223ed3c0f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/15c866f4eeb63c60bf7e86815b6ba61223ed3c0f/0_0_2400_1600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police seize marijuana from a dispensary in Toronto.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police seize marijuana from a dispensary in Toronto.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlos Osorio/Toronto Star via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rohmi says he takes C$15,000 in cash every day, and claims his business is an act of civil disobedience. \u201cWe\u2019re doing this as a Gandhi type of thing. Peaceful protest, activism,\u201d he says. Isn\u2019t he afraid of getting robbed? He laughs and nods at a plank in the corner with the word \u201cBertha\u201d scrawled on it. \u201cI got Bertha, she\u2019s my security!\u201d</p> <p>The road to legalisation in Canada has been long and circuitous. Medical cannabis has been legal in Canada since 2000. By 2012, under the Conservative government of Stephen Harper, there were 40,000 Canadians growing cannabis at home, says Chuck Rifici, a cannabis entrepreneur and former chief financial officer for the centre-left Liberal party. \u201cThe average Canadian is not particularly concerned with cannabis usage, or its illegality,\u201d he says, with wry understatement. Some of these homegrowers now illegally supply the clinics that are commonplace in all Canadian towns, while there are 38 licensed producers for the medical market, which has 130,000 users.</p> <p>Trudeau, who won the 2015 general election for the Liberals on a promise to free the weed, has spoken of his own cannabis use in casual terms, cementing his image as a modern progressive. Trudeau sought policy advice from Bill Blair, an old-school cop famed for his zero-tolerance approach to cannabis when he ran the force in Toronto. Trudeau told Blair he wanted to legalise cannabis to stop criminals from preying on kids, and Blair agreed that this was the best way to present the policy to the public.</p> <p>Cannabis is popular in Canada \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien/150415/dq150415b-eng.htm\">one-third of 18 to 24-year-olds use it</a>, as do 3.4 million of all Canadians, 10% of the country\u2019s population. For comparison, <a href=\"http://www.drugwise.org.uk/how-many-people-use-drugs/\">in the UK, there are about 2 million users</a>, 3% of the population.</p> <p>Blair <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/legalizing-marijuana-will-come-with-strict-controls-mp-bill-blair-says/article28137320/\">told Canada\u2019s Globe and Mail newspaper</a> in January: \u201cOur intent is to legalise, regulate and restrict.

          "bodyText": "Opposite a bleak government building in suburban Ottawa, Canada, a barebones \u201ccannabis clinic\u201d \u2013 with just a cash register, jeweller\u2019s scales and a glass counter \u2013 is doing a brisk trade. \u201cPirate! Muslim! Gangster! Yes! We all smoke!\u201d shouts one teen as he high-fives the owner, Rohmi. He pockets his pungent bag and bounces out, giggling. On the wall, there\u2019s a menu listing today\u2019s special: moonrocks \u2013 buds rolled in cannabis oil then dipped in powdered hash at C$40 (\u00a324) a gram. There are cans of Canna Cola; potent, weed-laced gummy bears; a mound of gooey hashish smelling of dark chocolate, hops and pine resin. If this is medicine, it\u2019s unclear what the illness is, other than sobriety. It makes an Amsterdam coffeeshop look tame \u2013 and it\u2019s this free-for-all, wild-west-of-weed attitude that Canada\u2019s government wants to tame by legalising cannabis during prime minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s first term in office. Laws that will legalise cannabis for recreational use will be announced in the week of 10 April, and will be passed by July 2018, say government sources, making Canada the first G7 country to do so. Globally, cannabis prohibition is being briskly dismantled, a wave of decriminalisation or legalisation sweeping south through the Americas, with states such as Colorado leading the way. California voted to legalise recreational use in November 2016. The US currently has 29 states offering legal medical marijuana and eight states with legal recreational cannabis markets. Countries including Uruguay, Mexico, Jamaica, Brazil, Colombia and Chile are either creating legal markets for medicinal cannabis or relaxing rules on possession and cultivation. In the EU, Germany is preparing for imminent full medicinal legalisation, and the Republic of Ireland voted in December 2016 to allow medical use. In the UK, medical marijuana is available in the form of a tincture spray, Sativex, but access is severely limited. What is different about Canada\u2019s plans to legalise is the scope of the law change \u2013 it will be legal, nationally, for anyone over the age of 18 to use cannabis for pleasure next year. Trudeau told journalists early this month that he wanted to seize the profits of the criminalised market and use the income to help those with drug problems. But his main aim in legalising the drug was to make it harder for children to get hold of it, arguing that alcohol laws showed that proper controls and regulations work. \u201cIt\u2019s easier for a teenager to buy a joint right now than a bottle of beer, and it\u2019s not right,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know by controlling and regulating it, we are going to make it more difficult for young people to access marijuana.\u201d The evidence is on his side: in Colorado, where cannabis has been legal since 2014, teen use has fallen by about 12%, due to a combination of factors including a smaller black market and better drugs education. Ironically, however, the upcoming change in Canada has prompted a huge growth in outlaw dispensaries. Rohmi and hundreds of other dealers selling in kerbside clinics are claiming to be operating under rules allowing Canadians to use cannabis to treat complaints as diverse as insomnia, ADHD and chronic pain. In reality, they are cashing in and riding the pre-legalisation green rush. Police are clamping down, with dozens of raids in recent weeks, but the mood on the streets and in the clinics is one of delighted anarchy, with some outfits simply reopening the day after a raid in a new spot. Rohmi says he takes C$15,000 in cash every day, and claims his business is an act of civil disobedience. \u201cWe\u2019re doing this as a Gandhi type of thing. Peaceful protest, activism,\u201d he says. Isn\u2019t he afraid of getting robbed? He laughs and nods at a plank in the corner with the word \u201cBertha\u201d scrawled on it. \u201cI got Bertha, she\u2019s my security!\u201d The road to legalisation in Canada has been long and circuitous. Medical cannabis has been legal in Canada since 2000. By 2012, under the Conservative government of Stephen Harper, there were 40,000 Canadians growing cannabis at home, says Chuck Rifici, a cannabis entrepreneur and former chief financial officer for the centre-left Liberal party. \u201cThe average Canadian is not particularly concerned with cannabis usage, or its illegality,\u201d he says, with wry understatement. Some of these homegrowers now illegally supply the clinics that are commonplace in all Canadian towns, while there are 38 licensed producers for the medical market, which has 130,000 users. Trudeau, who won the 2015 general election for the Liberals on a promise to free the weed, has spoken of his own cannabis use in casual terms, cementing his image as a modern progressive. Trudeau sought policy advice from Bill Blair, an old-school cop famed for his zero-tolerance approach to cannabis when he ran the force in Toronto. Trudeau told Blair he wanted to legalise cannabis to stop criminals from preying on kids, and Blair agreed that this was the best way to present the policy to the public. Cannabis is popular in Canada \u2013 one-third of 18 to 24-year-olds use it, as do 3.4 million of all Canadians, 10% of the country\u2019s population. For comparison, in the UK, there are about 2 million users, 3% of the population. Blair told Canada\u2019s Globe and Mail newspaper in January: \u201cOur intent is to legalise, regulate and restrict. There needs to be reasonable restrictions on making sure that we keep it away from kids, because I think that is very much in the public interest.\u201d Trudeau set up a taskforce, led by Blair, in June 2016 to write the roadmap towards legalisation. A more moderate and Canadian approach is hard to imagine. Experts included researchers and academics, patients and lawyers, users, chiefs of police and fire departments, and government officials and associations. Steve Moore, of British thinktank VolteFace, which is campaigning for legalisation in the UK, says Canada\u2019s model is more sensible than that of the US. \u201cThe American states that have legalised are too libertarian, with their billboards and TV advertising,\u201d says Moore, who lauds Trudeau\u2019s focus on tackling crime and reducing youth access. The Canadian path to legalisation is at once liberal and conservative, adds Moore, who believes such an approach could work in the UK. The Canadian taskforce\u2019s paper made more than 80 recommendations, including a minimum age of access \u2013 18 \u2013 with restrictions on advertising, and guidance on production, manufacturing and distribution.

It drew no conclusions on whether legalisation would lead to increased use, and instead took a harm-reduction and public-health approach \u2013 acknowledging the risk inherent in cannabis use and proposing ways to mitigate it.

Violent rightwing militants tend to be much older. Thomas Mair, who killed MP Jo Cox last year, was 52.</p> \n  <p>Every case is, of course, unique. And the reality is that, much as all politics is essentially local, so is terrorism.

to justify the president\u2019s blocked travel ban, which targets refugees and immigrants from six Muslim-majority countries, despite confirmation that the attacker was neither an immigrant nor a refugee.</p> \n  <p>Sebastian Gorka, a national security aide to the president and a former editor for the far-right news site Breitbart, <a href=\"http://video.foxnews.com/v/5369240578001/?#sp=show-clips\">told Fox News\u2019s conservative talk show host Sean Hannity on Wednesday evening</a> that the attack in Westminster, that left three people and the attacker dead, \u201cshould be a surprise to nobody\u201d.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe war is real and that\u2019s why executive orders like president Trump\u2019s travel moratorium are so important,\u201d Gorka said.</p> \n  <p>Despite the official\u2019s remarks it is almost certain that the British-born attacker, 52 year-old Khalid Masood, would not have been affected by Trump\u2019s ban, which targets immigrants and refugees from a handful of countries. Further, the US would have already been entitled to block Masood from the country, given his extensive criminal record.</p> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/23/sebastian-gorka-westminster-attack-trump-travel-ban\">Read more here.</a></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-03-23T22:35:24.347Z\">at 10.35pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-58d447b2e4b007e8557eef73\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-23T22:10:05.978Z\">10.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A spokeswoman for King\u2019s College Hospital in south London confirmed that the 75-year-old man had been treated there prior to his death. <br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-58d43f4be4b01ea2330bb6c1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-23T21:36:32.843Z\">9.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Well-wishers have donated more than \u00a3300,000 to the family of murdered police officer Keith Palmer. <br><br>The Metropolitan Police Federation launched an official memorial page at 9.13am today and it look less than 12 hours to reach its target.</p> \n  <p>The association set up the page after receiving a huge number of pleas from members who wanted to help.<br><br>Stephen Redgewell, who set up the page, said: \u201cA quick thank you for all those of you that have made your generous gifts in memory of Keith.

And I can tell you from my talks here with the US government and with partners around the world that the world is united to defeat the people who launched this attack, to defeat their bankrupt and odious ideology. </p> \n   <p>And I say that in confidence because our values are superior, our view of the world is better and more generous and our will is stronger.</p> \n   <p>Our Houses of Parliament in London have been attacked for centuries by all sorts of people. But the ideas embodied in that Palace of Westminster, freedom, democracy, the equality of human beings under the law, are stronger than any adversary and they will prevail.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Interestingly, Johnson also called for a debate about whether it was right to allow images of terrorist attacks to be broadcast as those events are taking place. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I may say, by the way, that I do believe that we should go through a period of reflection about how we transmit images of these events around the world in real time. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2c6bae11a8052a8c75d8f73f50464fa29d6b3ebd\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c6bae11a8052a8c75d8f73f50464fa29d6b3ebd/0_157_2694_1617/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson at the UN in New York attending a security council meeting on Somalia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson at the UN in New York attending a security council meeting on Somalia.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Lane/EPA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-58d3f582e4b01ea2330bb596\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-23T16:19:51.223Z\">4.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>PC Keith Palmer\u2019s former team have laid a wreath in memory of those who lost their lives yesterday.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/metpoliceuk/status/844943645061103617\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">PC Keith Palmer's former team lay a wreath in memory of those who lost their lives yesterday <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WestminsterAttack?src=hash\">#WestminsterAttack</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/QRkLOW6Ken\">https://t.co/QRkLOW6Ken</a></p>\u2014 Metropolitan Police (@metpoliceuk) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/metpoliceuk/status/844943645061103617\">March 23, 2017</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-58d3f4abe4b01ea2330bb591\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/heatherstewart\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-23T16:17:59.456Z\">4.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">PM visits injured in London hospital</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Theresa May has made a 40-minute private visit to an unnamed London hospital to comfort victims of yesterday\u2019s attacks and thank medical staff, her spokesman said at this afternoon\u2019s lobby briefing.</p> \n  <p>May also travelled to Buckingham Palace last night, at about 6pm, to hold her usual audience with the Queen, the spokesman confirmed.</p> \n  <p>He said May had signed the condolence book for the victims of the attacks and had received calls from a series of world leaders since the attack, including the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, German chancellor Angela Merkel and Donald Trump.<br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-03-23T16:19:25.122Z\">at 4.19pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-58d3f373e4b01ea2330bb58a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-23T16:14:47.269Z\">4.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>MPs have been attending a special service in the House of Commons led by the Speaker\u2019s chaplain, Rev Rose Hudson-Wilkin. </p> \n  <p>Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, and the shadow Commons leader Valerie Vaz were among the MPs in attendance.

I can\u2019t preempt what any review is likely to find but I would be surprised if there weren\u2019t attempts to direct traffic through the Black Rod entrance because traffic there is channelled through very heavy barriers. That will create no doubt some congestion problems and once they are in the parliamentary estate they would have to drive through so it would not be without an impact. But it is hard to see how a gate that can be opened to provide access to cars as quickly as Carriage Gates is not always going to create a security risk.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>MPs have long been aware that security at Carriage Gates could be better.

But as is routine, the police together with the House authorities are reviewing the security of the Parliamentary estate, co-ordinated with the Cabinet Office, who have responsibility for the security measures in place around the Government secure zone. All of us in this House have a responsibility for the security and safety of our staff and advice is available for Members who need it. <br></p> \n   <p>Mr Speaker, yesterday we saw the worst of humanity, but we will remember the best.</p> \n   <p>We will remember the extraordinary efforts to save the life of PC Keith Palmer, including those by my Rt Hon Friend the Member for Bournemouth East.</p> \n   <p>And we will remember the exceptional bravery of our police, security and emergency services who once again ran towards the danger even as they encouraged others to move the other way ...<br></p> \n   <p>Mr Speaker, a lot has been said since terror struck London yesterday. Much more will be said in the coming days. But the greatest response lies not in the words of politicians, but in the everyday actions of ordinary people. For beyond these walls today \u2013 in scenes repeated in towns and cities across the country \u2013millions of people are going about their days and getting on with their lives. The streets are as busy as ever. The offices full. The coffee shops and cafes bustling. As I speak millions will be boarding trains and aeroplanes to travel to London, and to see for themselves the greatest city on Earth. </p> \n   <p>It is in these actions \u2013 millions of acts of normality \u2013 that we find the best response to terrorism. A response that denies our enemies their victory. That refuses to let them win. That shows we will never give in. A response driven by that same spirit that drove a husband and father to put himself between us and our attacker, and to pay the ultimate price. A response that says to the men and women who propagate this hate and evil: you will not defeat us. Mr Speaker, let this be the message from this House and this nation today: our values will prevail. And I commend this statement to the House.<br></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ee1fe35a502bf04d37897266de577ce15ff5e97\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ee1fe35a502bf04d37897266de577ce15ff5e97/0_170_4666_3286/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Theresa May speaking in parliament.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"704\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Theresa May speaking in parliament.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Parliament TV</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-03-23T11:18:25.859Z\">at 11.18am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-58d3a80de4b007e8557eec9e\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/rowena-mason\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-23T10:54:09.681Z\">10.54am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Theresa May's statement \u2013 key extracts</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here are key extracts from Theresa May\u2019s statement.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Yesterday an act of terrorism tried to silence our democracy. But today we meet as normal, as generations have done before us and as future generations will continue to do, to deliver a simple message: we are not afraid and our resolve will never waver in the face ofterrorism. </p> \n   <p>And we meet here in the oldest of all parliaments because we know democracy and the values it entails will always prevail. Those values free speech, liberty, human rights and rule of law are embodied here in this place and shared by free people around the world.</p> \n   <p>A terrorist came to the place where people of all nationalities and culture gather to celebrate what it means to be free. He took out his rage indiscriminately on men, women and children. This was an attack on free people everywhere and on behalf of the British people I would like to thank our friends and allies around the world who have made it clear they stand with us.</p> \n   <p>What happened on the streets of Westminster sickened us all. While there is an ongoing police investigation, the House will understand there are limits to what I can say but having been updated by police and security officials let me set out what at this stage I can tell the house. </p> \n   <p>At approximately 2.40pm yesterday a single attacker drove his vehicle at speed into innocent pedestrians crossing Westminster Bridge, killing two people and injuring around 40 more. In addition to 12 Britons admitted to hospital, we know the victims include three French children, two Romanians, four South Koreans, one German, one Pole, one Irish, one Chinese, one Italian, one American and two Greeks. We are in close contacts with the governments of the countries of all those affected.</p> \n   <p>The injured also included three police officers returning from an event to recognise their bravery ... Two of those three remain in a serious condition. The attacker then left the vehicle and approached a police officer at Carriage Gates, attacking that officer with a large knife before he was shot dead by an armed police officer. Tragically 48 year old PC Keith Palmer was killed.</p> \n   <p>He was every inch a hero and his actions will never be forgotten.</p> \n   <p>I can confirm police have searched six addresses and made eight arrests in Birmingham and London. It is still believed this attacker acted alone and police have no reason to believe there are imminent further attacks on the public. His identity is known to the police and MI5. </p> \n   <p>When operational considerations allow he will be publicly identified. </p> \n   <p>What I can confirm is the man was British born and that some years ago he was once investigated by MI5 in relation to concerns about violent extremism. He was a peripheral figure. The case is historic. He is not part of the current intelligence picture.</p> \n   <p>There was no prior intelligence of his intent or the plot. Intensive investigations continue \u2026</p> \n   <p>Our working assumption is that the attacker was inspired by Islamist ideology. We know the threat from Islamist terrorism is very real. But while the public should remain utterly vigilant they should not and will not be cowed by this threat. </p> \n   <p>We are stepping up policing to reassure the public and as a precautionary measure it will mean increasing patrols in cities across the country, with more police and more armed police on the streets.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-03-23T11:01:32.367Z\">at 11.01am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-58d3a7e2e4b007e8557eec9a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-23T10:49:31.768Z\">10.49am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Corbyn says the injured include people from 10 nationalities.

One of my favourite parts of the job is showing constituents around the building. Although sadly it behaves like a private members club at times, it is the place where the people you choose to represent you come together to decide how we should go forward as a country. For all its faults, it is at the centre of our national life and that is why it was targeted yesterday ...</p> \n   <p>I spent nearly five hours yesterday locked in the chamber and voting lobbies of the House of Commons with about 350 other MPs. We watched the news on TV, shared mobile phone chargers so that we could reassure loved ones we were ok and talked about the work we do. It was a reminder that although we spend most of our time arguing about Brexit, austerity, the future of our Union and so many other things, those arguments obscure the fact that there is more that unites us than divides us. We are all committed to democracy, to the idea that the way we resolve our differences is through debate, sometime passionate argument, but never violence. If politics sometimes frustrates you (it certainly frustrates me at times), that is something worth holding onto, indeed something worth giving your life to defend - as PC Keith Palmer did so heroically yesterday.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-58d39b3ae4b01ea2330bb3cd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/severincarrell\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-23T09:54:28.861Z\">9.54am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Scottish parliament\u2019s debate and vote on calling for a new independence referendum will resume on Tuesday 28 March \u2013 the day before Theresa May triggers article 50 to begin the Brexit process. </p> \n  <p>That vote on Tuesday evening will almost certainly give Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, Holyrood\u2019s approval to ask May for the legal powers to stage the referendum just before the prime minister begins the process for leaving the UK. </p> \n  <p>The final 90 minutes of debate and the vote on Sturgeon\u2019s referendum motion, plus four opposition party amendments, were suspended at 15.55 on Wednesday in solidarity with the Westminster parliament after the terror attacks.</p> \n  <p>With its flags flying at half mast, Holyrood\u2019s business bureau met on Thursday morning but opted not to abandon today\u2019s sessions to resume the referendum debate immediately. </p> \n  <p>Instead, there will be a ministerial statement on childcare and a debate on British sign language.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/severincarrell/status/844848041332895747\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ScotParl\">@ScotParl</a> confirms <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/indyref2?src=hash\">#indyref2</a> debate and vote now on Tuesday 28 March; party leaders to use <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/FMQs?src=hash\">#FMQs</a> to mark <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Westminster?src=hash\">#Westminster</a> attack <a href=\"https://t.co/hnEqeS6CRm\">pic.twitter.com/hnEqeS6CRm</a></p>\u2014 Severin Carrell (@severincarrell) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/severincarrell/status/844848041332895747\">March 23, 2017</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-03-23T09:56:50.892Z\">at 9.56am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-58d39a64e4b01ea2330bb3c6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/jonhenley\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-23T09:52:23.782Z\">9.52am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>French authorities have launched an inquiry into the London attack after it became clear three French schoolchildren were wounded, two of them seriously.</p> \n  <p>The counter-terrorism section of the Paris public prosecutor\u2019s office has opened an investigation into \u201cattempted assassination related to a terrorist enterprise\u201d.<br></p> \n  <p>The investigation, which is standard procedure in France when French nationals are victims of violence abroad, is in the hands of the DGSI internal intelligence agency. </p> \n  <p>The children were part of a group on a week-long visit to London from the Saint-Joseph de Concarneau lyc\u00e9e in Brittany.<br></p> \n  <p>About a dozen members of the group, aged 15 to 16, are believed to have been on Westminster Bridge when the Hyundai car ploughed into them.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-03-23T09:57:46.346Z\">at 9.57am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-58d397ade4b007e8557eec52\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/andrewsparrow\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-23T09:48:49.345Z\">9.48am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Commons is now sitting in the normal way.

What I will say is this: the threat level in London and our country remains the same. It\u2019s severe. That means, according to the experts, an attack is highly likely. The commissioner who just retired said last year that, as far as an attack was concerned, it was a matter of when, not if. Thankfully the police and security services practise for such incidents.

So you have seen across London bollards, in lay person\u2019s terms, for the additional security measures that have been taken over the last couple of years now. You have seen the additional searches done by the police when it comes to vehicles and when it comes to intelligence-led stop and search. That\u2019s going to carry on.

We must never accept a situation where people try and divide Christians, Jews, Muslims, Sikhs, Hindus from each other, of those who are not members of organised faiths. We must never accept a situation where people can incite hatred against people because of the faith they belong to.</p> \n   <p>When you think about why terrorists want to attack London, it\u2019s because they hate the fact that we don\u2019t simply tolerate each other, whether you are a Christian, Muslim, Jew, Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, member of an organised faith or not, we respect, embrace and celebrate each other.

          "bodyText": "This live blog is now closing. Live coverage continues here: Here is what we now know about Wednesday\u2019s terrorist attack in Westminster: The victims The number of victims has risen to four, after a 75-year-old man died in hospital on Thursday. He had been on life support since the attack. He has not been named. The three others killed have been identified as PC Keith Palmer, who was stabbed outside parliament; and Aysha Frade and Kurt Cochran, who died on Westminster bridge. Four people remain in hospital in a serious condition, one with life-threatening injuries. The attacker Police have said that Khalid Masood was born in Kent on Christmas day 1964, and that this was not his birth name. Multiple reports now say he was born as Adrian Elms and converted to Islam. This name has not been confirmed. He had a number of convictions \u2013 for assaults, grievous bodily harm, possession of offensive weapons and public order offences \u2013 spanning 20 years, and had spent time in jail, though not for terrorist-related offences. Masood was previously known to MI5 was once investigated in relation to concerns about violent extremism, but was considered \u201ca peripheral figure\u201d, prime minister Theresa May said. The Sun reports today that Masood spent the night before the attack at the Preston Park hotel in Brighton. The Guardian has not been able to verify this. The arrested Eight people were arrested as a number of addresses were raided in London, Birmingham and elsewhere: A 39-year-old woman at an address in east London on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts. A 21-year-old woman and a 23-year-old man at an address in Birmingham on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts. A 26-year-old woman and three men aged 28, 27 and 26 at a separate address in Birmingham on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts. A 58-year-old man at a separate address in Birmingham on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts. The UK home secretary, Amber Rudd, has said it is \u201cfar too early\u201d to know the full picture of what was known about Masood and when. She told ITV News: Intelligence services are working hard to put together the whole picture, but I would caution drawing conclusions yet. I would wait and see what comes forward from the intelligence that\u2019s going on now. Rudd said it \u201cseems likely\u201d Masood was radicalised online: We know there\u2019s an onslaught of radicalisation online, there\u2019s so much information that tries to go out as propaganda to persuade people to take this sort of action. Candlelit vigils for the victims are scheduled to be held on Friday in Birmingham and London. On Thursday evening thousands gathered in Trafalgar Square to pay their respects. The man who photographed a Muslim woman walking past a victim of the Westminster terrorist attack has defended her and said the image has been \u201cmisappropriated\u201d. The photograph \u2013 showing a woman holding her phone as a group of people gathered around someone injured in the attack on Westminster bridge \u2013 was criticised by some on social media as alleged evidence of her lack of concern. But Jamie Lorriman, the freelance photographer who took the picture, told Australia\u2019s ABC that the series of images showed the woman\u2019s distress: The people who took on that picture are being rather selective. In the other picture in the sequence she looks truly distraught \u2026 personally I think she looks distressed in both pictures. It\u2019s wrong it\u2019s been misappropriated in that way. He told the ABC it was \u201cimpossible to know\u201d what was going through the woman\u2019s mind: The look on the woman\u2019s face, she\u2019s horrified, she\u2019s in the middle of a traumatic situation. She probably just wanted to get off the bridge. I feel so sorry for the woman in the picture. If she\u2019s seen this, she must feel awful. As investigators piece together the background of Khalid Masood, reports are emerging about his past. Police have said that Masood was born in Kent on Christmas day 1964, and that this was not his birth name. Multiple reports now say he was born \u2013 and lived till at least 2003 \u2013 as Adrian Elms. Police have not commented on that, but according to the Press Association, a spokesman said he was known by a number of different names and research into them was continuing. As well as Kent, he was believed to have lived for some time in the West Midlands, where police raids took place after the attack in London. The Sun reports today that Masood spent the night before the attack at the Preston Park hotel in Brighton. The Guardian has not been able to verify this, and Press Association says it was told by staff there that they had been \u201cinstructed not to talk\u201d. Theresa May said the right things this week, writes Martin Kettle. But will she put them into practice? This consensual approach was the right course. It also allowed her to get some politically difficult information out into the public domain early and without provoking any blowback. May\u2019s statement contained a disturbing admission, one familiar from the 7/7 events and from Woolwich, and which could yet become a stick to beat her with. Khalid Masood had been known to the authorities. He had come to MI5\u2019s attention in the past. But he was off the radar in the run-up to his act of terror. There was no prior intelligence of his readiness to act. When attacks like this happen people rally round. The popular wisdom is difficult to mistake in London this week. Britain\u2019s wartime self-image as the nation that could take it, that was not afraid, could keep calm and carry on or, this week, go on drinking tea came effortlessly to the fore. Newspapers that are too puffed up with their own importance, especially post-Brexit, got it badly wrong by trying to be divisive or demanding unspecified tough action. A politician who pretended to be Winston Churchill would get it wrong too. Read the full column here: A Romanian tourist who was in London to celebrate her boyfriend\u2019s birthday was pulled from the river by a passenger boat after falling into the Thames during the attack. Andreea Cristea, a 29-year-old architect, was knocked into the Thames as Khalid Masood drove towards Parliament Square. She was plucked to safety when the crew on a passing boat saw her floating downstream. Staff on the Milennium Diamond used a boat hook to grab her clothing. She was then picked up by a rescue boat and treated by paramedics. Kyle Haughton, managing director at the firm, said: \u201cCity Cruises\u2019 Millennium Diamond was in the area of the incident at the time and worked alongside London\u2019s emergency services to support in the rescue efforts of a woman in the water. \u201cOnce alerted by people on the bridge, the ship\u2019s captain reacted fast on spotting her. He halted the boat in order to hold her out of the water and stop her from being carried any further by the current. The emergency services were called immediately and arrived within minutes to take over the rescue operation.\u201d Her partner, Andrei Burnaz, suffered minor injuries. Dan Mihalache, Romania\u2019s ambassador to the UK, told Romanian media that Cristea sustained serious head injuries and had badly damaged lungs. Mihalache said: \u201cThey were tourists. Unfortunately they were unlucky. They had come to celebrate his birthday.\u201d Khalid Masood was a violent criminal convicted of multiple offences spanning 20 years, Robert Booth and Nazia Parveen report: His offences included assaults, grievous bodily harm, possession of offensive weapons and public order offences. He had spent time in jail but not for terrorist-related offences, according to Amber Rudd, the home secretary. The 52-year-old\u2019s first conviction was in November 1983 for criminal damage and his last conviction was in December 2003 for possession of a knife, said the Metropolitan police. It also emerged that Masood had been previously known to MI5 although the prime minister said he had been considered \u201ca peripheral figure\u201d in relation to suspected Islamist terror threats. He was once investigated in relation to concerns about violent extremism, said Theresa May. Downing Street declined to say whether that was between 2010 and 2016 during May\u2019s time as home secretary. A spokesperson repeated her position that Masood came across the radar of the security services \u201csome years ago\u201d. Since then, there had been no intelligence to suggest his intent to mount a terrorist attack. The news that the London attacker was born in Britain and inspired by extremist Islamist ideology was entirely predictable, as was his criminal record. The standout detail from the sketchy profile we have of Khalid Masood is his age: 52, nearly twice that of most contemporary attackers. The significance of Masood\u2019s age will later become clear. For the moment it simply underlines the variety of extremist profiles, and the unpredictability of the threat. Most Islamic militants have been between the ages of 18 and 35, with the average age declining in recent years. Some analysts see their attraction to radicalism as partly a generational rebellion. Violent rightwing militants tend to be much older. Thomas Mair, who killed MP Jo Cox last year, was 52. Every case is, of course, unique. And the reality is that, much as all politics is essentially local, so is terrorism. Islamic extremist strategists have wrestled with this challenge to their global vision for years, and have yet to evolve an adequate response. Western experts argue interminably over whether the motives of individuals are 10% ideology and 90% local context or vice versa. But the sad reality is that, though it may be reassuring to blame bad guys, or bad ideas, from a long way away for violence at home, no one should be surprised that the man who attacked one of Britain\u2019s most symbolically charged locations was born in the UK. The Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has suggested the country\u2019s controversial far-right politician Pauline Hanson is playing into the hands of Islamist terrorists, after she used the London attack as an opportunity to push for a Muslim ban, AAP reports. The One Nation leader tweeted after the attack, calling for people to pray for a ban on Muslims in Australia. \u201cThe object of the Islamist terrorist is to get the broader society to turn on Muslims at large,\u201d Turnbull told Melbourne radio. Turnbull said he had already made that position clear to Senator Hanson, adding: If you seek to attribute to all Australian Muslims responsibility for the crimes of Isil [Islamic State] then you are doing what Isil wants. The fundraising page set up by the Metropolitan police federation to assist the family of murdered officer Keith Palmer has soared past its target of \u00a3250,000. It currently stands at over \u00a3358,000. Here is what we know so far about the arrests that have taken place since the terror attack: Eight people were arrested as a number of addresses were raided in London, Birmingham and elsewhere. Those arrested include: A 39-year-old woman at an address in east London on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts. A 21-year-old woman and a 23-year-old man at an address in Birmingham on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts. A 26-year-old woman and three men aged 28, 27 and 26 at a separate address in Birmingham on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts. A 58-year-old man at a separate address in Birmingham on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts. Four of the five South Koreans who were injured in the attack have been released from hospital. They are all aged in their 50s and 60s. The Korea Herald reports that the four who have been released from hospital \u2013 three women and a man \u2013 suffered injuries such as broken bones when they were caught in the rush following the attack. They are likely to return to South Korea today, the Korea JoongAng Daily reports. A 67-year-old woman who underwent surgery for a head injury was \u201cawaiting progress after the operation\u201d, South Korean foreign ministry spokesperson Cho June-hyuck told reporters at a news briefing. \u201cWe will provide all necessary assistance to the injured citizens and their families until they come home safely,\u201d he said. The South Korean government yesterday issued a statement saying it \u201cstrongly condemns the barbarian attack on civilians\u201d and would actively participate in the global fight against terrorism. Associated Press has more on Kurt Cochran, the American man named earlier as one of the victims who was killed on Westminster bridge. Cochran, who was travelling across Europe with his wife, Melissa, to celebrate 25 years of marriage, died after being hit by the car driven by Khalid Masood. Melissa Cochran was injured. AP reports from West Bountiful, Utah, the couple\u2019s home: For the last decade, the couple ran a recording studio in their basement in a neighbourhood just outside Salt Lake City. Bret Layton started crying while talking about his longtime friend outside Cochran\u2019s house on Thursday. Layton said he ran the recording studio with Kurt Cochran. \u201cHe\u2019s one of those guys: you just know you want him to be your friend within five minutes \u2026 He was just an overall good guy to everybody,\u201d Layton said. Melissa Cochran is still hospitalised. She suffered a broken leg, broken rib and a cut and bruises, said friend Mike Murphy. Murphy, owner of Murphy\u2019s Guitars in Bountiful, said Kurt Cochran would come into his shop regularly. \u201cHe loved music,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cHe was always around when there were music things going on.\u201d Emma Dugal, executive director of Bountiful Davis art center, said the couple had volunteered at the organisation\u2019s annual summer arts festival for years. She described them as warm, friendly people and, as a couple, inseparable. She said Cochran\u2019s death will have a huge impact on the music community. \u201cI know of musicians who lacked confidence and who weren\u2019t sure how they wanted to present their talent, but Kurt encouraged them and got them out into performing, and has just made a huge difference in so many people\u2019s lives,\u201d Dugal said. Kurt Cochran was a good father who will be missed dearly by his two adult sons, said Danny Wiley, the stepfather to Cochran\u2019s sons. He says Cochran loved skateboarding and playing basketball with his sons. \u201cIt\u2019s devastating,\u201d Wiley said. \u201cHe was a good guy, everybody liked him. He always had a smile on his face.\u201d Security at the Palace of Westminster is under intense scrutiny after the attack, report Rajeev Syal, Rowena Mason and Heather Stewart: A string of MPs identified Carriage Gates, the entrance on Parliament Square used by the attacker, as a vulnerable point as the officers most closely guarding it are not armed and the gate tends to be left open during parliamentary votes. The attacker, Khalid Masood, is thought to have been shot by a member of the close protection team of Michael Fallon, the defence secretary, whose car happened to have been parked in New Palace Yard because a vote was taking place at the time. Having breached the perimeter of the Palace of Westminster estate at Carriage Gates, there are several routes an intruder could take to the House of Commons chamber area without passing through locked doors accessible by a security pass. Alan Johnson, the Labour former home secretary, said the Carriage Gates were a point of vulnerability, particularly during votes, when they were left open to give easy access for ministers. He said: \u201cWhen the votes are on, the gates are open so that ministers can drive in from wherever they are in their different departments in Whitehall.\u201d Liberal Democrat MP Tom Brake, a member of the House of Commons commission and a former deputy leader of the Commons, said: \u201cThere is the Carriage Gates issue. That is the weak point within the boundary of the Palace of Westminster. \u201cI can\u2019t preempt what any review is likely to find but I would be surprised if there weren\u2019t attempts to direct traffic through the Black Rod\u2019s entrance because traffic there is channeled through very heavy barriers.\u201d Thousands gathered in Trafalgar Square in central London on Thursday evening to show solidarity with the victims of Wednesday\u2019s attack. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, and home secretary Amber Rudd sent a defiant message, with Rudd telling the crowd: The terrorists will not defeat us. We will defeat them. The pro-EU march will go ahead in London on Saturday, organisers have insisted. Earlier on Thursday evening, Stephen Dorrell, chair of European Movement UK, said it would not go ahead, citing the extra burden on police following Wednesday\u2019s terror attack. But Unite4Europe, the umbrella group that has organised the anti-Brexit protest, says the march will go ahead as planned: We have spoken to the police and the GLA [Greater London Authority]. We can confirm that the march will go ahead. All plans remain the same. We will only move to our contingency if the police are still investigating the crime scene come Saturday. Our contingency will include the same march start point and time (Park Lane, 11am) with an alternate end point nearby. We will not be intimidated. We will stand in unity and solidarity. We will march on the heart of our democracy and reclaim our streets in honour and respect of those that fell yesterday. We will be observing a minute of silence and remembrance at the start of the rally. We would encourage all attendees to bring with them some symbol of respect and to act in the appropriate fashion on the day. European Movement UK has issued a clarification, saying that while the march will go ahead, it will not be participating: We don\u2019t want to increase the burden on the police at this difficult time. My colleague Denis Campbell has spoken to NHS staff who were among the first to respond to Wednesday\u2019s attack: It was a typically busy day in the emergency department at King\u2019s College hospital when Dr Emer Sutherland started receiving text messages from relatives and friends. They were the first indication of the scale of the horror unfolding just two miles down the road in Westminster. Within minutes, she and her colleagues were on major alert and preparing to receive the first of many critically injured casualties. \u201cWe are a major trauma centre so we are used to dealing every day with majorly injured patients, such as people who have been hit by a car or stabbed,\u201d said Sutherland, who is the consultant clinical lead for the hospital\u2019s A&amp;E department. But even for her, a highly experienced A&amp;E doctor, it had an impact. \u201cIt\u2019s always emotional when you are working on a day like that. Trauma cases are always emotional because you have to quickly treat someone who\u2019s critically injured and who might die.\u201d Just after 3pm, King\u2019s received the first of eight casualties from the attack, two of whom were critically ill. \u201cAt one point we were treating six of the eight casualties in the emergency department at the same time,\u201d Sutherland said. \u201cIt was very busy, but doctors and nurses were focused and calm. \u201cExtra colleagues came to help from operating theatres across the hospital, extra pharmacists came with additional supplies, extra radiologists came to do and interpret scans and extra porters came to move patients. That helped reassure the A&amp;E staff. Everyone played their part.\u201d Read more here: The Sun has video, taken from within the Palace of Westminster, showing the prime minister being swiftly escorted to her car as the attack unfolded. Theresa May was whisked away from parliament \u2013 where she is believed to have been in the voting lobby of the Commons \u2013 to Downing Street after the attacker, Khalid Masood, breached the security cordon of the parliamentary estate and fatally stabbed PC Keith Palmer. Masood was then shot dead by an armed officer. The video \u2013 which is on the Sun\u2019s website here \u2013 shows May escorted by several security officers, at least one of whom is armed, to a grey vehicle. She runs slightly as she approaches the car, which is then driven out of the grounds. A voice can be heard shouting: \u201cThere is an incident \u2026 Do not go out \u2026 Stay in the car.\u201d Speaking on BBC Newsnight, home office minister Ben Wallace insisted there are \u201cplenty of armed officers\u201d in Westminster, following calls by some for police to be routinely equipped with firearms. Wallace told the BBC: There are plenty of armed officers around the House of Commons and the House of Lords, both inside and outside and also around the area, the government quarter, there\u2019s a whole range of police forces that cover that area \u2013 diplomatic protection, Metropolitan police and other police. There are plenty of guns available and on show as a matter of reassurance. There are multiple reports this evening that Khalid Masood, the man who killed four people before being shot dead on Wednesday, was born Adrian Elms before later converting to Islam and changing his name. The Guardian is working to verify these reports. It is known that Masood was born in Kent. The Metropolitan police had earlier said Masood was likely not to have been his birth name. We do not yet know the identity of the 75-year-old man, injured in Wednesday\u2019s attack, who has died this evening. His death takes the number of victims to four. The attacker also died. The A&amp;E department at King\u2019s College hospital took in eight patients in the wake of the attack: six men and two women. One \u2013 the 75-year-old man \u2013 died on Thursday evening after his life support was withdrawn. The hospital said another patient remains in a critical condition there. Four are stable and two have been discharged. This is Claire Phipps picking up the live blog for continuing coverage. The front pages of Friday\u2019s newspapers are arriving now; here\u2019s a quick roundup. The Guardian: Killed by a homegrown terrorist The Sun: I\u2019m off to London today The Times: Killer was Muslim convert The Daily Mail: Google, the terrorists\u2019 friend The Mirror: Evil will not win The i: British attacker fell off MI5 radar The Financial Times: Homegrown Islamist named by police as Westminster attacker A Trump administration official seized on the Westminster terror attack to justify the president\u2019s blocked travel ban, which targets refugees and immigrants from six Muslim-majority countries, despite confirmation that the attacker was neither an immigrant nor a refugee. Sebastian Gorka, a national security aide to the president and a former editor for the far-right news site Breitbart, told Fox News\u2019s conservative talk show host Sean Hannity on Wednesday evening that the attack in Westminster, that left three people and the attacker dead, \u201cshould be a surprise to nobody\u201d. \u201cThe war is real and that\u2019s why executive orders like president Trump\u2019s travel moratorium are so important,\u201d Gorka said. Despite the official\u2019s remarks it is almost certain that the British-born attacker, 52 year-old Khalid Masood, would not have been affected by Trump\u2019s ban, which targets immigrants and refugees from a handful of countries. Further, the US would have already been entitled to block Masood from the country, given his extensive criminal record. Read more here. A spokeswoman for King\u2019s College Hospital in south London confirmed that the 75-year-old man had been treated there prior to his death. Well-wishers have donated more than \u00a3300,000 to the family of murdered police officer Keith Palmer. The Metropolitan Police Federation launched an official memorial page at 9.13am today and it look less than 12 hours to reach its target. The association set up the page after receiving a huge number of pleas from members who wanted to help. Stephen Redgewell, who set up the page, said: \u201cA quick thank you for all those of you that have made your generous gifts in memory of Keith. It is heart warming to see the messages that have been posted and those that have chosen not to post a message, the gift alone speaks a thousand words.\u201d Police say a 75-year-old man has died in hospital from injuries sustained in the attack on Wednesday. Police have now said the package is not suspicious and all cordons have been lifted. A peace vigil will be held in Birmingham on Friday to promote unity, after the city\u2019s most prominent mosque issued a statement condemning the Westminster terror attack as \u201cbarbaric and heartless\u201d. The city centre vigil has been organised by the Stand Up To Racism group and MEND (Muslim Engagement and Development) and will begin at 5pm in High Street. Mosque chairman Muhammad Afzal said of Wednesday\u2019s atrocity in London: \u201cNothing justifies taking lives of innocent people. Those responsible must be brought to justice.\u201d Urging calm within all communities and offering condolences to those bereaved by the attack, he added: \u201cThe Islamic faith does not allow anyone to take the life of others. No religion justifies the indiscriminate killing of individuals in such a barbaric and heartless way, and such acts only serve to differentiate between the misguided and the just.\u201d Met police said officers were dealing with a suspect package on Birdcage Walk. The street runs on the lower side of St James\u2019s Park from Buckingham Palace to Parliament Square. After the vigil in Trafalgar Square, Omer El-Hamdoon, deputy secretary-general of the Muslim Council of Britain, said: \u201cIt\u2019s good to see that many people have come out today. This is an important message that Londoners need to display which is that terrorism will not divide us and it is not going to stop us and scare us. For any person to attack innocent people is outrageous and despicable and we condemn it unreservedly.\u201d A Scotland Yard spokesman said research into other names the attacker used was ongoing, adding: \u201cKhalid Masood is not at this early stage believed to be his birth name.\u201d The fundraising appeal launched by the Metropolitan Police Federation for the family of PC Keith Palmer has exceeded \u00a3260,000 and appears set to soon reach its \u00a3300,000 target. Donations can be made on the JustGiving page. Contrary to the tweet quoting Stephen Dorrell earlier, Unite for Europe says it has spoken to the police and GLA and that Saturday\u2019s anti-Brexit protest march will go ahead from 11am as planned. Acting Metropolitan police commissioner Craig Mackey, who himself was caught up in the terror attack, spoke of the three innocent people killed during the \u201ctruly terrible\u201d incident, that many more were gravely injured and that \u201call of us have been deeply affected by what has happened\u201d. To applause, he said: \u201cThis cannot be undone, much as we would wish it. However we do get to choose our reaction and gathering here tonight shows exactly how we must move forward. We must stand together. People have tried to tear this city apart with acts of terror many times before. They have never succeeded and they never will.\u201d Detectives investigating the attack are treating Mackey as a significant witness because he was at the scene. An army veteran who was among the first responders to the stabbing of PC Keith Palmer told the Guardian he had no second thoughts about rushing to the scene of the terror attack. \u201cI didn\u2019t even feel I had a choice: there was nothing to hesitate about,\u201d Mike Crofts, a former army captain said, speaking for the first time since the incident. \u201cInstinct kicks in.\u201d Croft, who runs the Three Pillars Project, an organisation working with troubled youth and convicts, was leaving a parliamentary meeting about boxing with Sgt Tony Davis, who had trained him at Sandhurst years before, when he saw the attack. \u201cHe came at PC Palmer from one side and I ran from the other,\u201d he said, describing the feeling as \u201csurreal\u201d. Davis described the same moment to ITV\u2019s This Morning: \u201cThere were people running, coming round towards the gate. All of a sudden I saw a large chap brandishing two knives come through the gates and start attacking the policeman. \u201cAt that point instinct kicked in, I leapt over the fence because that guy needed assistance.\u201d The two men started performing first aid on Palmer, and were quickly joined by Foreign Office minister Tobias Ellwood, who performed CPR. Palmer was pronounced dead on the scene. Croft, who left the army last year, said: \u201cThe unity and the teamwork showed by the police officers who were on the scene immediately, the other people who rushed to the scene initially and later, and the helicopter team, was heroic. It would compare with the casualty evacuations I\u2019ve seen in Afghanistan.\u201d The view from Berlin this evening... Guardian writer Stephen Moss tweets: More from the Trafalgar Square vigil, where the home secretary, Amber Rudd, paid tribute to \u201ccourageous and brave\u201d police officer Keith Palmer, who was stabbed to death by the Westminster attacker. \u201cHe was courageous, he was brave, and he was doing his duty. And he was not alone in doing that. I know that all officers of the Met are like that and, in my experience, so are all policemen. I want us to say thank you to them all for the great sacrifice and risks they take to keep us safe.\u201d To applause from the crowd, she said of the attack: \u201cThey will not win, we are all connected and we showed that today by coming together, by going to work, by getting about our normal business, because the terrorists will not defeat us, we will defeat them. We are strong in our values and proud of our country.\u201d The former Manchester United footballer Gary Neville stood shoulder to shoulder with students, military veterans and city leaders in a vigil outside the town hall in Manchester. Neville, who chose to stand with members of the public rather than city leaders during the minute\u2019s silence, declined to speak when approached afterwords by reporters. Led by the lord mayor, Carl Austin-Behan, a small crowd braved chilly temperatures for a minute\u2019s silence for the victims of the Westminster terror attack. Among those paying tribute was Danny Standring who, like the murdered PC Keith Palmer, served in the Royal Artillery. \u201cIt\u2019s a horrible, horrible, horrible state of affairs,\u201d Standring said. We must stand united against terrorism and oppression. Radicalism should be stamped on.\u201d Standing next to him, Hemmy Spiggott, a former royal military police officer, said: \u201cIt would be good to see everyone from all communities say we\u2019re not having it. It doesn\u2019t matter what faith you belong to, or whether you have no faith. \u201cIt\u2019s a free country, we\u2019re allowed to worship as we see fit. We\u2019re not going to let people like that drive a wedge between us. We can only do that by coming together.\u201d Yasmin Mannan, a student at Manchester University, said it was important that other British cities stood in solidarity with London. \u201cI\u2019m a Londoner so I was devastated when I heard the news. Manchester, like London, is such a diverse city that it\u2019s important to show unity,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s made me more defiant because what the terrorists want is to change this way of living and co-existing.\u201d Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS foundation trust says two patients were treated at St Thomas\u2019 hospital following the attack \u2013 one man and one woman: \u201cThe man has now left hospital and the woman remains in a stable condition.\u201d More from Amber Rudd\u2019s interview with the BBC political editor, Laura Kuenssberg. The home secretary revealed that Khalid Masood had spent time in prison, but said it was not for terrorist-related offences. \u201cAll I can tell you is what the police have said so far, which is that he was someone known to them but that he was on the periphery of the intelligence agencies. I think we\u2019ll hear more from them in due course but we have to remember that this man was known to them partially because he had been in jail but not for terrorist offences,\u201d Rudd said. Thousands of people have gone to Trafalgar Square this evening for a candlelight vigil to honour the victims of the terror attack. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, praised the bravery of the emergency services responding to the attack: \u201cWhen Londoners face adversity, we always pull together. We stand up for our values and we show the world we are the greatest city in the world.\u201d The Independent Police Complaints Commission has said \u201cno police officers are under investigation\u201d over the Westminster terror attack, but it is \u201ccurrently investigating the circumstances\u201d. IPCC deputy chair Sarah Green said: \u201cI recognise that this is a very difficult time for the police service, following the tragic loss of PC Keith Palmer and the injuries to other officers. We are giving this investigation the highest priority and we will conclude it as soon as possible.\u201d More detail from the Met on those arrests made overnight: A 39-year-old woman was arrested at an address in east London. A 21-year-old woman and a 23-year-old man were arrested at an address in Birmingham. A 26-year-old woman and three men aged 28, 27 and 26 were arrested at a separate address in Birmingham. All were arrested on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts. Further, a 58-year-old man was arrested on Thursday morning at a separate address in Birmingham. A woman who fell from Westminster bridge into the River Thames during the terrorist attack is from Romania. Footage of the atrocity appears to show a person falling from the bridge as the attacker ploughed a car through pedestrians. The Romanian embassy in London confirmed the woman\u2019s name as Andreea Cristea. Counter terrorism detectives are investigating the possibility of a wider conspiracy that assisted the attack and made eight arrests after raids in Birmingham, and east London. Seven people in Birmingham and one in London were arrested on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts. Police still believe the attack was carried out by one person, and are examining what role if any, those arrested played. Searches were also carried out in Carmathanshire, Wales, and Brighton, Sussex. A vigil to pay tribute to those killed and injured in yesterday\u2019s attack is about to begin in Trafalgar Square, central London. Amber Rudd, the home secretary, in her first public comments today, has warned against blaming the intelligence services. \u201cThey do a fantastic job. The fact that he was known to them does not mean that someone has 24 hour cover. So I think we will discover more about this man and the people around him. I have no doubt the intelligence services are doing a great job,\u201d she said in a BBC interview. Asked if there had not been \u201ca clear intelligence failure\u201d because of concerns over his violent extremism and not just his criminal past, Rudd responded: I think that would absolutely be the wrong judgment to make. I am confident that as we get more information - and I really can\u2019t be drawn any further on it at the moment - that we will learn more and take comfort from the information we have. It is hard for them because they operate with a large degree of secrecy for good reasons. I would urge everyone to give them the space to do the inquiries that they need.\u201d As well as Birmingham earlier, police conducted raids in Brighton and Wales on Thursday. A spokesman for Sussex police declined to confirm whether raids had taken place in Brighton, saying: \u201cAll questions about the operation should be referred to the Metropolitan police.\u201d Four people have died, including police officer Keith Palmer, and the attacker. Seven of the 29 people injured remain in a critical condition. The assailant was named by police on Thursday as Khalid Masood, 52, who was born in Kent but was believed to have been living in the West Midlands most recently. He drove a car into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge, killing two people, before crashing it outside parliament and trying to enter the complex, armed with a knife. One of the victims was named as Aysha Frade, 43, who worked as a teacher in London. The mother-of-two had family in Betanzos, Galicia, in north-west Spain. The third person killed by the attacker was named as Kurt Cochran, a US tourist, who was in Europe to celebrate his 25th wedding anniversary with his wife, Melissa. She is in hospital with serious injuries. The prime minister, Theresa May, said Masood had been investigated \u201csome years ago\u201d by MI5 in relation to concerns about violent extremism but was \u201cnot part of the current intelligence picture\u201d. The Met police said Masood had a range of previous convictions for assaults, including GBH, possession of offensive weapons and public order offences. His most recent was in December 2003 for possession of a knife. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack but its claim has not been verified. Members of the public have been chalking messages in Trafalgar Square, where the mayor of London Sadiq Khan is leading a vigil later. We\u2019re handing over to Chris Johnston for the evening. Many thanks for reading today. Here\u2019s another line from Laura Kuenssberg\u2019s interview with Amber Rudd. That\u2019s all from me for today. My colleague Jessica Elgot is wrapping up shortly, too, but colleagues will be taking over and keeping the blog going into the evening. An update from King\u2019s College hospital, one of the major trauma centres treating some of the injured victims from yesterday\u2019s attack. Two patients have discharged, four are stable and two more are in a critical condition. After visiting the injured in hospital, Theresa May has been back at work in Downing Street this afternoon, No 10 said. She spoke by phone about the attacks with European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, Italian prime minister Paolo Gentiloni, Canada\u2019s prime minister Justin Trudeau and King Salman of Saudi Arabia. Later this afternoon, she was holding private talks at Downing Street with former Polish prime minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the chairman of the country\u2019s ruling Law and Justice party. Amber Rudd, the home secretary, has told the BBC that it would be wrong to see yesterday\u2019s attack as an intelligence failure. The Polish embassy has an update on the injuries of a Polish man caught up in the attack. The embassy said he suffered minor injuries and was released from hospital on Thursday. Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, has been speaking to reporters in New York after a meeting of the UN security council. He said that an attack on London was an attack on the world, and that democracy would prevail. Yesterday the people of London were attacked in a cowardly and despicable way and our thoughts today are with the victims and their families. And on behalf of the United Kingdom I\u2019m grateful for all the condolences that have been expressed here at the UN and the minute\u2019s silence that was held in the security council. You may know that today there are victims in London from 11 nations which goes to show that an attack on London is an attack on the world. And I can tell you from my talks here with the US government and with partners around the world that the world is united to defeat the people who launched this attack, to defeat their bankrupt and odious ideology. And I say that in confidence because our values are superior, our view of the world is better and more generous and our will is stronger. Our Houses of Parliament in London have been attacked for centuries by all sorts of people. But the ideas embodied in that Palace of Westminster, freedom, democracy, the equality of human beings under the law, are stronger than any adversary and they will prevail. Interestingly, Johnson also called for a debate about whether it was right to allow images of terrorist attacks to be broadcast as those events are taking place. He said: I may say, by the way, that I do believe that we should go through a period of reflection about how we transmit images of these events around the world in real time. PC Keith Palmer\u2019s former team have laid a wreath in memory of those who lost their lives yesterday. Theresa May has made a 40-minute private visit to an unnamed London hospital to comfort victims of yesterday\u2019s attacks and thank medical staff, her spokesman said at this afternoon\u2019s lobby briefing. May also travelled to Buckingham Palace last night, at about 6pm, to hold her usual audience with the Queen, the spokesman confirmed. He said May had signed the condolence book for the victims of the attacks and had received calls from a series of world leaders since the attack, including the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, German chancellor Angela Merkel and Donald Trump. MPs have been attending a special service in the House of Commons led by the Speaker\u2019s chaplain, Rev Rose Hudson-Wilkin. Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, and the shadow Commons leader Valerie Vaz were among the MPs in attendance. Many were in tears, others had their heads bowed. Two services took place at 12.30pm and 3pm, with another at 6.30pm. Here are some of the places where flags are flying at half mast today after the Westminster attack. The family of PC Keith Palmer have released a statement through the Met police: Keith will be remembered as a wonderful dad and husband. A loving son, brother and uncle. A longtime supporter of Charlton FC. Dedicated to his job and proud to be a police officer, brave and courageous. A friend to everyone who knew him. He will be deeply missed. We love him so much. His friends and family are shocked and devastated by his loss and ask that they are left to grieve alone in peace. The police have also released more details of Palmer\u2019s career, he joined the parliamentary and diplomatic protection command in April 2016 and before that was in the territorial support group, based at Catford but patrolling and working across London. Before the TSG, he was based in Bromley borough between 2002 and 2009. Keith was 48 and joined the Met in November 2001. He was married with a five-year-old daughter. He was nominated in 2015 for best thief taker in the Commissioner\u2019s Excellence Awards, having made more than 150 arrests in 12 months. PC James Aitkenhead, who worked alongside him in the TSG, called him a \u201cgenuinely nice person\u201d. When I heard what had happened I knew it would be him because that\u2019s just the sort of guy he was, to step straight in when others might step back. He had a great work ethic, he worked on our warrants\u2019 car for years, getting up at 4am to serve warrants and arresting wanted offenders. He was always so positive, always staying late after everyone else and getting in early. In his personal life he was a massive Charlton Athletic fan and had a season ticket. We will miss him so much. Insp Mark Turner, from the parliamentary and diplomatic protection command, who most recently worked withPalmer, said: He really was a solid reliable member of the team \u2013 he came in and just got the job done, quietly and efficiently. He was a fantastic member of staff and will be sorely missed. As a mark of respect, Palmer\u2019s shoulder number \u2013 4157U \u2013 will be retired and not reissued to any other officer. My Westminster colleague Peter Walker is on the newly reopened Westminster Bridge, where floral tributes are being left. Jeremy Corbyn has been laying flowers on Westminster Bridge as a tribute to those killed yesterday. He also said he had signed the book of condolence for PC Keith Palmer. He said Palmer was \u201ca great man who did a great job in parliament\u201d. A woman from an inner-city Birmingham estate that was raided by anti-terror police has claimed the dead London terrorist was her neighbour. Iwona Romek, a factory worker who did not know the attacker\u2019s name, described the killer as a father who was a keen gardener and lived with his Asian wife and young child. Romek, 45, who has lived in Quayside in Winson Green for 12 years, confirmed she knew the London terrorist when she was shown a photograph of him on the stretcher. I have been so shocked by it all. They were a nice family, very reserved. He was very calm. I saw the photos on the TV and knew it was the man who lived here. He had a wife, a young Asian woman, and a small child who went to school. Romek said the family moved out a few months ago. The house is now occupied by new tenants. On Thursday afternoon a police van remained parked outside the white front door. He was a nice guy. I used to see him outside doing his garden. Never any trouble. Romek said the man and his family moved out around Christmas very suddenly and did not say goodbye. Describing the late-night raid, she said officers had swarmed the terraced mews house. I just heard a lot of banging and shouting. They were shouting to open the door. It was all a bit scary. There was a helicopter above and men in white suits. The JustGiving page set up to support the family of PC Keith Palmer has now raised more than \u00a3100,000, a spokesman for the site said. It is now the fastest growing JustGiving crowdfunding page in history. The site reached its \u00a3100,000 target in just over six hours with donations from more than 5,500 members of the public. JustGiving has also made a donation of \u00a310,000. People have also been donating to the London air ambulance. Boris Johnson is addressing the UN security council in New York on Thursday. He was in Washington when the attack took place, where he was offered President Trump\u2019s personal condolences by vice-president Mike Pence. Sources close to the former mayor of London said he was \u201cshocked and disgusted\u201d by the attack on his home city and that the terrorist attack underlined the importance of confronting Daesh [Isis], the topic of yesterday\u2019s talks in the US capital. He is expected to travel on to Turkey, where he will discuss heightened aviation security measures. This is what he tweeted about the attack yesterday. Masood, 52, was born in Kent and detectives believe he was most recently living in the West Midlands. Masood was also known by a number of aliases, police said in a statement. Scotland Yard said Masood was not the subject of any current investigations and there was no prior intelligence about his intent to mount a terrorist attack. However, he was known to police and had a range of previous convictions for assaults, including GBH, possession of offensive weapons and public order offences. His first conviction was in November 1983 for criminal damage and his last conviction was in December 2003 for possession of a knife. He had not been convicted for any terrorism offences. Anyone with any information about Masood can call the anti-terrorist hotline 0800 789 321. Police have named the attacker as Khalid Masood. He was 52, born in Kent and detectives believe he was most recently living in the West Midlands. The Conservative MP Tom Pursglove witnessed the shooting of the attack from close up yesterday. He has put a statement about this on his Facebook page. Here\u2019s an extract. I was witness to part of the attack and saw, at close proximity, the assailant being shot by a police officer, in what was a great act of bravery in order to protect the lives of others. This was obviously a very unpleasant and upsetting experience for all those who bore witness to it and I was particularly grateful to the prime minister who took the time to call me last night - this was extremely kind of her, given all that was going on. President Trump has tweeted a tribute to the American killed in the attack yesterday. Rightwing commentators have wasted no time in appearing on US media and using the Westminster attack to further their political agendas. Nigel Farage has appeared twice on US television already, today arguing that the London attacks prove Donald Trump is right on hardline immigration and anti-Muslim policy. \u201cIt seems to me our political leaders really ought to start saying sorry,\u201d the former Ukip leader told Tucker Carlson on Fox News on Thursday morning. Surely this is the big takeout: when Donald Trump tries to makes America safer, when Donald Trump tries to make sure that these scenes we\u2019ve had in Paris, Brussels and Berlin and now London aren\u2019t repeated in America, we have people on Fifth Avenue and behind me in Westminster out on the streets protesting. What these politicians have done for the last 15 years may well affect how we live in this country for the next 100 years. He appeared on Fox News on Wednesday night, just hours after the attack, making a similar point. \u201cWe\u2019ve made some terrible mistakes in this country,\u201d Farage told Sean Hannity on Fox News. \u201cWhen Donald Trump tries to put in place vetting measures, he\u2019s doing it to protect your country,\u201d he added. He wasn\u2019t the only hardline conservative to appear in the US media. the Daily Mail columnist Katie Hopkins also turned up on Carlson\u2019s Fox show, echoing Farage\u2019s xenophobic rhetoric. We\u2019re a country that spends so much time tiptoeing around the cultures that refuse to join us and not enough time defending the culture they\u2019ve chosen to join, but because I say those things I am widely hated for those views. People are cowed, people are afraid and people are not united. UK writers on US alt-right websites also used the London terror attacks to incite hatred against Muslims. In a video on InfoWars, which published conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton\u2019s health during the 2016 election, writer Paul Joseph Watson argued that it was time to \u201cacknowledge that Islam is not a religion of peace and in serious need of reform\u201d. On Breitbart News, whose former executive chair Steve Bannon is now one of the most influential advisers to the president, the UK executive editor James Delingpole wrote a column declaring that Islamic terror attacks could end western liberal values. Jonathan Bartley, the Green party co-leader, has accused Ukip of trying to exploit the attack to divide communities. Responding to the statement from the Ukip leader, Paul Nuttall (see 1.55pm), Bartley said: Every time you think Ukip can\u2019t sink any lower, they do. It is abhorrent that Paul Nuttall is trying to capitalise on this terrible tragedy to create division between communities. Just a brief look around him would have revealed to Nuttall a resilient multicultural society coming together to reject violence. Trying to blame certain communities for this horrific incident is politics at its worst \u2013 the Ukip leader should be utterly ashamed. A tragic detail has emerged about the French school whose students were caught up in the attack on Westminster Bridge. Estelle Rouat, a pupil at the Lyc\u00e9e Saint-Joseph in Brittany, was one of the 89 victims who lost their lives in the massacre at the Bataclan concert hall during the Paris terror attacks of November 2015. Three of the pupils were injured in yesterday\u2019s attack, two seriously. A group of 36 year 11 and 12 pupils from the lyc\u00e9e was walking from parliament on to Westminster Bridge when they were struck by the attacker\u2019s car. With the exception of the three wounded, all were due to fly home on Thursday. At least 100 people have attended a memorial in Spain to commemorate Aysha Frade, who was also killed in the terror attack on Wednesday, the Press Association reports. A minute\u2019s silence was held in the Galician municipality of Betanzos, where the British national\u2019s family originates and where she spent her summers. Betanzos councillor Andres Hermida said the community in Spain was in \u201cenormous pain\u201d and shrouded in an \u201catmosphere of sadness\u201d. He told the Press Association: We had a minute\u2019s silence in the Plaza de la Constitucion outside the local government building and we have declared three days of mourning, which will include flying the flag at half mast until Saturday. About 100 people attended despite the rainy weather. Frade, who worked in administration at independent sixth-form school DLD College London, in Westminster, is understood to have been 43 and married with two daughters. Reports said she had left work and was crossing Westminster Bridge as part of her usual routine when she was hit by the car. Her family is well known in Betanzos, where older sisters Silvia and Michelle run the Notting Hill English language academy. According to Hermida: The sisters suspended classes at the academy yesterday afternoon when they received the news and they left for London, we believe with their mother. Aysha spent her summers here and had many friends here since her childhood, so we are all very affected. You never think things like this will happen to you and it\u2019s horrible luck when it happens at all, but when it happens close then it hurts that much more. It\u2019s an immense tragedy and an enormous pain \u2013 there is a big sadness in Betanzos. We have condemned the terrorist attack and promised our support to the family. Fumio Kishida, the Japanese foreign minister, has issued a message of condolence to the UK after yesterday\u2019s attack and condemned \u201csuch inhuman and despicable acts of terrorism\u201d. These are some of the floral tributes in Westminster and next to the National Police Memorial. An army veteran who was among the first on the scene of the Westminster attack has told how he tried to save the life of murdered police officer Keith Palmer. Tony Davis, who is now a GB Boxing coach, jumped over a barrier and tried to intervene moments after the officer was attacked. Davis, from Darlington, told ITV\u2019s This Morning he was leaving parliament following a press event with a group of boxers when he saw the attack taking place. There were people running, coming round towards the gate. All of a sudden I saw a large chap brandishing two knives come through the gates and start attacking the policeman. At that point instinct kicked in, I leapt over the fence because that guy needed assistance. The police were holding their ground and that is when poor Keith got attacked. You start moving back with adrenaline pumping in. At this point the assailant was coming towards us and I recall, out of the corner of my eye, one of the marksmen coming out and putting three rounds in him. Appearing on the show without shoes on because they are still being cleaned, Davis told how he rushed in to give the officer CPR, saying: I just knew he was in a great deal of difficulty. Everything happened so quick, but my natural instinct was to get over there and give some assistance if need be. Initially, when he fell to the ground I tried to have a look at him and put him in the recovery position and check his pulse. Davis said Palmer had wounds to his head, arm and another under his rib cage. About 90 seconds into it another guy called Mike came and joined in and at this time there were lots of police around, Keith\u2019s colleagues. Three and a half minutes was when the MP [Tobias Ellwood] came in and sort of took over CPR. I\u2019ve been speaking to Labour sources in the House of Lords, where there were clearly some concerns about the way yesterday\u2019s incident was handled. Lady Angela Smith, Labour\u2019s leader in the Lords, the chief whip Steve Bassam and their staff, were holed up there for a considerable period. For much of that time, they were reliant on tweets from journalists for information about the incident. \u201cWe heard the gunfire and were immediately told to get away from the windows at the front of the building \u2013 and then we spent two hours on the corridor, not really knowing what was happening other than from social media,\u201d said the source, who added that they had worked with the Conservative leader Lady Evans and her team to maintain a calm atmosphere among peers, some of whom had witnessed the events. It was unclear at that point whether there was another attacker still at large. Black Rod, the senior parliamentary official best known for knocking on the door of the Commons at the state opening of parliament, liaised with the parliamentary authorities as peers struggled to find out what was going on. Later, Smith and others moved to their offices \u2013 and remained there until the lockdown of parliament was lifted, about five hours later. The family of Kurt Cochran have issued a statement, through the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, after the American tourist was identified as the third victim of the attack in Westminster. The couple were scheduled to fly back to the US today. Melissa Cochran\u2019s parents are currently LDS missionaries in London. Clinton Payne, Melissa\u2019s brother, said in a statement: Our family is heartbroken to learn of the death of our son-in-law, Kurt W Cochran, who was a victim of Wednesday\u2019s terrorist attack in London. Kurt was a good man and a loving husband to our daughter and sister, Melissa. They were in Europe to celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary and were scheduled to return to the United States on Thursday. Melissa also received serious injuries in the attack and is being cared for in the hospital. We express our gratitude to the emergency and medical personnel who have cared for them and ask for your prayers on behalf of Melissa and our family. Kurt will be greatly missed, and we ask for privacy as our family mourns and as Melissa recovers from her injuries. Tom Brake, a member of the House of Commons Commission and the former deputy leader of the Commons, told the Guardian that he thought the review of security at the Palace of Westminster would focus on Carriage Gates, the gates used by the attacker yesterday. Brake said: There is the Carriage Gates issue. That is the weak point within the boundary of the Palace of Westminster. I can\u2019t preempt what any review is likely to find but I would be surprised if there weren\u2019t attempts to direct traffic through the Black Rod entrance because traffic there is channelled through very heavy barriers. That will create no doubt some congestion problems and once they are in the parliamentary estate they would have to drive through so it would not be without an impact. But it is hard to see how a gate that can be opened to provide access to cars as quickly as Carriage Gates is not always going to create a security risk. MPs have long been aware that security at Carriage Gates could be better. The authorities have recently been working on something called the \u201cNew Palace Yard security enhancement project\u201d, which will include replacing temporary galvanised barriers at the entrance with a stronger vehicle barrier. A business case was meant to be approved in February 2017 and work is due to start by the end of 2017, after planning permission is obtained from Westminster Council. Some news now from the police probe in Birmingham, from my colleague Jamie Grierson. Officer are searching an address in Winson Green, Birmingham. Police vans are parked outside the property in Quayside, while uniformed officers were seen entering the flat. Eyewitnesses told reporters that police vans arrived at the property around 1am. An American tourist from Utah has been named as the third victim of the Westminster Bridge attack, Kurt Cochran. His wife Melissa is still in hospital, according to her sister. In a public post on Facebook, her sister wrote: SO, SO SORRY to inform everyone - Kurt has passed away from the injuries he received during the attack in London. My sister, Melissa, has a broken leg, a broken rib, and a cut on her head. While we are glad she survived, our hearts are broken and will never be the same after losing our dear uncle, brother-in-law, father. Kurt, you are a HERO, and we will never forget you. Some more details are emerging about some of the injured. Italy\u2019s ambassador Pasquale Terracciano says she has visited an Italian woman in hospital who lost consciousness for about 10 minutes after being struck by the car\u2019s bumper. The woman, a tourist from Rome, underwent surgery for a compound leg fracture. She also suffered a less serious injury to two of her vertebrae near her neck, and head trauma. The German foreign office has also confirmed that among those injured yesterday is a female German citizen \u2013 no more information than that yet. The number of different nationalities tells you a lot about the location of the attack \u2013 and London as a city. A diverse, multicultural city which attracts so many different people from around the world to visit, work and make their homes. The Ukip leader, Paul Nuttall, has put out a lengthy statement about the attack saying that Muslim communities \u201cmust do far more\u201d to combat extremism. He said: Muslim communities must do far more to cut this cancer out of their midst. We need a more rigorous and assertive official approach on this. There should be no more pussyfooting around agonising whether \u2018Prevent\u2019 strategies risk stigmatising people. Muslim citizens \u2013 just like non-Muslim ones \u2013 need to know it is simply unacceptable to be aware of radicalisation but to withhold information from the authorities. He did not acknowledge that the Muslim Council of Britain had condemned the attack strongly, first in a statement issued yesterday soon after the attack happened, and again in a more extensive statement today. The UN security council, which is being chaired by the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, will observe a minute of silence at 2pm to mark the atrocity. The Duchess of Cambridge has expressed her sympathy with the victims and injured of the Westminster attack. Speaking at the launch of Out of the Blue, a series of films about mental health for parents and children, at an event in central London, Kate said: I know you would all want to join me in sending our thoughts and prayers to all those sadly affected by yesterday\u2019s terrible attack in Westminster. We will be thinking of all the families, as we discuss the important issues we\u2019re here to talk about. On the World at One just now Alan Johnson, the Labour former home secretary, said that one problem yesterday was that the gates to New Palace Yard (the main entrance to the Palace of Westminster for cars) were open because a vote was taking place. Those were the gates through which the attacker entered. Johnson said: The other thing was there was a vote at the time. When the votes are on, the gates are open so that ministers can drive in from wherever they are in their different departments in Whitehall. We might have to think about that as well. Johnson also suggested that there might be a case for arming all police on duty at the Palace of Westminster (a proposal also backed by Theresa Villiers, the Conservative former Northern Ireland secretary, in the Commons earlier - see 11.57am). Johnson said: The armed police are the second line of defence. The first line of defence, all too often, are the unarmed police, which we might need to rethink. The major crossing where the car attack on pedestrians took place has reopened already, police say. However, there are still widespread closures in the area. The injuries suffered by an Irish person in the Westminster terror attack are not life-threatening, the republic\u2019s parliament has been told. As the Press Association reports, the deputy prime minister, Frances Fitzgerald, revealed the victim\u2019s condition as she described the murders in central London as a \u201ccowardly act\u201d. Here\u2019s more from Jason Burke on the language used in the Isis propaganda and on British-born extremists: \u201cSoldiers\u201d responding to the call is used to describe people such as Omar Mateen, who opened fire in a nightclub in Florida last year and who claimed allegiance to Isis during the attack without any prior contact with the group. Other terms are used to describe attackers such as those who made up the Paris/Brussels network who, for the most part, were trained, commissioned and dispatched by Isis planners after spending time in Syria. The vast majority of attackers are local \u2013 many born in the countries they attack in, or at least naturalised citizens or long-term residents. Same in France, with a couple of recent exceptions, and elsewhere in Europe. The idea that terrorists systematically fly thousands of miles to infiltrate and strike is a fallacy \u2013 though it does occasionally happen. 9/11 set up this idea, but was an anomaly. The Isis claim was issued in English, Arabic, French and German. Yes, it was aimed at \u201cenemy\u201d but aimed at supporters too. Isis needs to boost morale. It\u2019s motto is \u201cto endure and expand\u201d. It\u2019s done precious little of either recently, so needs to make a point to potential and actual sympathisers and militants already in ranks who may be losing heart. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, offered his condolences to Theresa May for the attack. In a statement released by the Kremlin, he said: Terrorist attacks are becoming increasingly cunning and cynical. It is obvious that all members of the international community should join forces to stand up against the terrorist threat. Denis Campbell, our health policy editor, has just sent this: The boss of the NHS today lauded the \u201cimmense personal bravery\u201d and vital role played by health service personnel across the capital who helped the casualties from yesterday\u2019s attack. Speaking at an event in the City of London, Simon Stevens said: I would like to just start, given what happened, the terrible events of yesterday afternoon, by using this opportunity to thank the staff across the NHS in London who responded so brilliantly to the terrorist outrage in Westminster. The fact is that this was not just paramedics and ambulance crew but staff from St Thomas\u2019 hospital running across Westminster Bridge into potential danger. I think that really demonstrates not only the professional skill of all our staff across the NHS but also immense personal bravery. Stevens marked one minute\u2019s silence for the victims of the attack alongside staff who oversaw the NHS response from its London Incident Coordination Centre, which was activated as soon as news came through about 2.30pm on Wednesday. In all 68 paramedics and ambulance crew personnel from the London ambulance service were involved in the response to the attack. and casualties were treated at five London hospitals: St Mary\u2019s, Chelsea &amp; Westminster, King\u2019s College, Royal London and St Thomas\u2019. Poland\u2019s prime minister became the first senior European leader to draw a link between the London attack and the European Union\u2019s migrant policy, saying the assault vindicated Warsaw\u2019s refusal to take in refugees. Poland\u2019s government has refused to accept any of the 6,200 migrants allocated to it under the European Union\u2019s quota scheme that is designed to share the burden of taking in the large numbers of migrants and refugees who have come to Europe over the past two years. \u201cI hear in Europe very often: do not connect the migration policy with terrorism, but it is impossible not to connect them,\u201d Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlo told private broadcaster TVN24. The EU\u2019s migration commissioner, Dimitris Avramopoulos, on a visit to Warsaw, warned member states against failing to host refugees to help alleviate pressure on frontline states bearing the brunt of arrivals across the Mediterranean. \u201cThe commissioner should concentrate on what to do to avoid such acts as yesterday in London ... Poland will not succumb to blackmail such as that expressed by the commissioner,\u201d Szydlo said. \u201cThe commissioner is coming to Warsaw and trying to tell us: you have to do what the EU decided, you have to take these migrants .... Two days later another terrorist attack in London occurs,\u201d she said. The former US president Barack Obama has said no act of terror will shake the resilience of the British. Nigel Farage has used the London terror attack as a reason to justify Donald Trump\u2019s travel ban on travellers from Muslim-majority countries as he appeared on Fox News to claim it showed there should be more vetting of migrants. The former Ukip leader appeared on the US network in the early hours of the morning to blame politicians who embrace multiculturalism and uncontrolled immigration from Middle Eastern countries for \u201cinviting in terrorism\u201d. He said it was a reason for US citizens to stop protest against Trump\u2019s travel ban, even though Theresa May has confirmed police believe the attacker was British born. He said: We\u2019ve made some terrible mistakes in this country, and it really started with the election of Tony Blair back in 1997, who said he wanted to build a multicultural Britain. His government even said they sent out search parties to find immigrants from all over the world to come into Britain. Do you know what? I don\u2019t think we vetted a single one of them. The problem with multiculturalism is that it leads to divided communities. It\u2019s quite different to multiracialism. That\u2019s fine, that can work very happily and extremely well. But we\u2019ve finished up with very divided communities. I\u2019m sorry to say that we have now a fifth column living inside these European countries. Surely an American audience seeing this horrendous thing happening in Westminster should start to say to itself that when Donald Trump tries to put in place vetting measures, he is doing it to protect your country. Frankly, all those people out protesting in Fifth Avenue in New York and elsewhere need to have a good, long hard think about what they are doing. Frankly, if you open your door to uncontrolled immigration from Middle Eastern countries, you are inviting in terrorism. I do actually think that the moment has come for us to actually point the blame. What these politicians have done in the space of just 15 years may well affect the way we live in this country over the next 100 years. Victoria Ayling, a Ukip heritage and tourism spokesman, also retweeted a series of inflammatory posts about \u201cchallenging the West\u2019s Muslim\u2019s problem\u201d and a need for \u201caction against Islam\u201d. The Guardian\u2019s Jason Burke has some useful context on the credibility of the statement from Isis. The language in the statement does not name the attacker and suggested he was inspired by the group rather than organised. At Birmingham Central Mosque, chairman Mohammed Afzal was ready with a statement for journalists on Thursday condemning the London attacks. He handed out copies of a booklet called Terrorism Is Not Islam, a 12-page guide the mosque has produced. Fifty-five thousand copies of the leaflet were handed out at mosques, schools and shops across Birmingham, supported by West Midlands police. Afzal said he didn\u2019t know if the terrorist had attended the mosque because they did not yet know his identity. He questioned why the intelligence services had stopped monitoring the attacker. \u201cWhy did MI5 not keep an eye on him?\u201d he asked. In the House of Lords peers have also been speaking about the attack yesterday. One of the most striking interventions came from Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, who spoke to peers about the Christian lessons to be learnt from atrocity. He said he was struck by three images from yesterday. The first is of a vehicle being driven across Westminster Bridge by someone who had a perverted, nihilistic, despairing view of objectives of what life is about, of what this society is about, that could only be fulfilled by death and destruction. The second is of that same person a few minutes later on a stretcher or on the ground being treated by the very people he had sought to kill. The third is of these two houses, where profound disagreement, bitter disagreement, angry disagreement, is dealt with not with violence, not with despair, not with cruelty, but with discussion, with reason, and with calmness. It seems to me that those three pictures point us to deep values within our own society, deeper even than the ones that have been mentioned in the prime minister\u2019s statement and other statements, which is the sense that comes from a narrative within our society for almost 2,000 years that speaks of, at this time of year as we look forward to Holy Week and Easter, of a God who stands with the suffering and brings justice, and whose resurrection has given to believer and unbeliever the sense that, where we do what is right, where we behave properly, where that generosity and extraordinary sense of duty that leads people to treat a terrorist is shown, where that bravery of someone like PC Keith Palmer is demonstrated, that there is a victory for what is right and good over what is evil, despairing and bad. That was shown yesterday, hat is shown not just in our expression of values but in our practices which define those values and that is the mood that we must show in the future. UPDATE: The full text of Welby\u2019s speech is on his website here. It has emerged that the attacker \u2013 who has still not been named \u2013 was not among the 3,000 Britons on MI5\u2019s list of individuals whom they regard as potentially capable of committing an act of domestic terrorism. May told the Commons he had been on the radar of the security services as a \u201cperipheral figure\u201d years ago. About 3,000 Britons, mainly Islamists, are monitored because police suspect they might be capable of an attack. Of them, 500 are the subject of active investigations and only a limited number of those become the targets of physical surveillance. The Guardian understands that the attacker was not one of them. He did not even make the list of 3,000. Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, has been speaking to US news show Morning Joe. He says the attacker was known to police and MI5, as May said earlier this morning. I think what I can say about the individual concerned is that his values, his idea of the world will not prevail. He launched an attack at the heart of our democracy as has happened many times in the last decades. The values of that Palace of Westminster will continue to triumph and whatever he thought he was doing, he will not succeed. Amaq, the news agency used by Isis to broadcast propaganda, says that the group is responsible for the attack. It calls the attacker \u201ca soldier of Islamic State.\u201d This is a claim by them, which obviously cannot be verified at this stage. The wording of the Isis statement suggests he was inspired, rather than directed by them but we have no confirmation on either front. Often what is significant in the Commons is what is not said. As the Guardian\u2019s home affairs editor Alan Travis says, it was striking that this atrocity has not led to calls for a new anti-terror crackdown. The one exception to this was Theresa Villiers suggesting that all police officers guarding \u201csensitive sites\u201d in London should be routinely armed. (See 11.57am.) But the fact that this was a relatively modest proposal, which Theresa May was happy to sidestep, proves Alan\u2019s point; there is no appetite in the Commons for a fresh wave of authoritarianism. The Metropolitan police has acted fast to step up security at London\u2019s airports, reports the Guardian\u2019s Helena Smith. Within hours of the attack, extra patrols of police armed with automatic weapons were in place at Heathrow\u2019s terminals. By 3.10PM yesterday \u2013 exactly 30 minutes after the as-yet-unidentified assailant ploughed the rented SUV into people on Westminster bridge \u2013 six heavily armed police were standing outside one entrance to the departures lounge of Terminal Two. In an effort to reassure the public the Met police had announced that extra patrols, armed and unarmed, would be in place, \u201cparticularly in crowded places and iconic locations\u201d. Despite the heightened police presence however, there were no other evident restrictions for travellers flying out of Heathrow last night or this morning. PC Keith Palmer was a Charlton Athletic fan and the club have placed a red and white scarf on his seat in the stand where he held a season ticket. Several MPs have called for a permanent memorial to PC Keith Palmer for making \u201cthe ultimate sacrifice for our democracy.\u201d Conservative MP Nigel Evans said Palmer was \u201cone of us\u201d. The tribute to Keith and the police are that we are here today and our proceedings are going on. We have the arch that\u2019s been spoken about before, which is a lasting memorial to those who paid the ultimate sacrifice for our democracy. I do hope that at an appropriate time, with discussion with the family, that we too may be able to look at a lasting memorial to Keith in order that each and every one of us know that there are people putting their lives on the line for our democracy today. Fellow Tory MP Michael Fabricant also called for a memorial in Palmer\u2019s honour and Palmer\u2019s friend, James Cleverly, asked for him to be given a posthumous award for bravery. The prime minister said she was sure the issue would be considered by the parliamentary authorities. In the Commons Theresa May has now finished her statement. In Edinburgh Nicola Sturgeon has just started first minister\u2019s questions in the Scottish parliament. She says many MSPs have friends and even family members working in Westminster. They were shocked by what happened, she says. She says her thoughts and prayers are with the family of PC Keith Palmer. And she praises the bravery of all those who serve in the police. She says she was updated by Police Scotland yesterday, and again this morning. There is no evidence of a threat to Scotland. But, as a precautionary measure, policing has been increased, she says. She says the only people to blame for acts of terrorism are those who perpetrate them. She says she wants to echo the words of Theresa May: terrorists seek to undermine our values, but they will not succeed, she says. UPDATE: Here is a link to the text of Sturgeon\u2019s statement. Tobias Ellwood, the junior foreign office minister who went to the aid of PC Keith Palmer, has been listening to tributes in the House. His face was full of emotion. The MP, who performed CPR on the dying officer, did not speak but his bravery was mentioned by many MPs from both parties. Theresa Villiers, the former Northern Ireland secretary, used her question during the statement to suggest that all police officers guarding \u201csensitive sites\u201d in London should be routinely armed. She asked Theresa May: As we reflect on what happened, is it time to consider whether the police who guard sensitive sites known to be of interest to terrorists like Parliament or like airports should routinely carry personal protection weapons, even when those officers are not part of the units formally tasked with armed response? May said that whether particular officers were armed was \u201can operational matter\u201d for the police. She went on: They are the best able to judge the circumstances in which it is best for individuals to have those arms but of course we have seen a significant increase in the number of armed response vehicles, the number of counter terrorism specialists, firearms officers. It is a sad reflection of the threat that we face that it has been necessary to do that but we have been doing that.

Here are some more quotes from MPs who have been speaking during the statement. Harriet Harman, the former Labour deputy leader, said the act of terror had failed. As an act of terror it has failed. It has failed because we are here and we are going to go about our business. It failed because, as the prime minister so rightly said, we are not going to allow this to be used as a pretext for division, hatred and Islamophobia. Ed Miliband, the former Labour leader, said the UK was united against terrorism. We must not allow anyone to try and divide our country on the basis of faith or nationality after these attacks. The reality is that across London, across the country, we are a country united against these attacks. Dominic Grieve, the Conservative chair of the intelligence and security committee, said it was a \u201cmiracle\u201d that the UK had escaped most terror plots in recent years and that \u201cthis house is going to have to simply be resolute in accepting that such attacks cannot always be prevented\u201d. The Lib Dem leader, Tim Farron, praised Theresa May for the tone she adopted in her statement, which was \u201cunifying and defiant and with which she really did speak for us all\u201d. The Plaid Cymru MP Liz Saville Roberts said one attacker could not shut down a city. One man cannot shut down a city and one man cannot lock down democracy \u2026 We must also not react to such a warped ideology with unworthy responses. I\u2019ve taken the quotes from PoliticsHome. No 10 would not say precisely when the attacker was last investigated by MI5. Theresa May\u2019s spokesman would only say it was \u201csome years\u201d ago in response to repeated questions about when, why and how the intelligence agencies have monitored him in the past. The spokesman also refused to say whether May believes there have been any failings by the security services in their decision not to continue monitoring him. However, Downing Street did confirm that the prime minister intends to stick to her plan of triggering article 50 on Wednesday next week. The Hyundai Tucson used by the attacker was rented from an Enterprise branch on Spring Hill passage in Birmingham, one mile from the property raided last night on Hagley Road, the Guardian understands. May says that, as home secretary, there were two events every year that brought home to her how brave the police are. They were the national police service memorial day and the police bravery awards. What always struck her, she says, was how officers, when asked about what they did, just said they were doing their job. The Queen has said her \u201cthoughts, prayers, and deepest sympathy\u201d are with all those who have been affected by yesterday\u2019s \u201cawful violence\u201d. Queen Elizabeth had been due to open the new Metropolitan police building this morning, but the ceremony has been cancelled. She went on: \u201cI know I speak for everyone in expressing my enduring thanks and admiration for the members of the Metropolitan Police Service and all who work so selflessly to help and protect others.\u201d Witnesses yesterday described seeing a woman pulled from the river after the carnage on Westminster bridge, who is alive but in a serious condition. It has since emerged she was a Romanian tourist celebrating her boyfriend\u2019s birthday in London. Romanian Ambassador Dan Mihalache told Realitatea TV that the woman sustained serious head injuries and has badly damaged lungs. Her boyfriend suffered a foot fracture. The pair haven\u2019t been named yet. \u201cThey were tourists, unfortunately they were unlucky. They had come to celebrate his birthday.\u201d He said the pair planned to wed,\u201d Mihalache said. The Conservative MP James Cleverly sounded close to tears as he paid tribute to PC Keith Palmer in the chamber a few minutes ago. He said he first met him 25 years ago as Gunner Keith Palmer at the Royal Artillery HQ. He was a strong, professional public servant and it was a delight to meet him here again only a few months after being elected. Would [Theresa May] in recognition of the work that he did and the other police officers and public servants in the House do consider recognising his gallantry and sacrifice formally with a posthumous recognition? May said the idea would \u201cof course be considered in due course\u201d. Theresa May\u2019s announcement that two Greeks were among the 12 injured has caught authorities in Athens at least by surprise. While the Greek ministry of foreign affairs had strongly condemned the attack, describing it as a \u201ccowardly act,\u201d there was no suggestion that Greeks were among the victims. A press officer at the Greek embassy in London said staff has only been made aware when the British prime minister announced it in parliament. \u201cIt came as a surprise. We had not been made aware of it by the Metropolitian police earlier this morning,\u201d the officer, Claire Koltsida, told the Guardian. \u201cWe now know it was a couple who suffered light injuries and took themselves off in a private capacity to the hospital. We hope to know more later today.\u201d James Cleverly, the Tory MP who knew Palmer during his time in the armed forces, has been paying a highly emotional tribute to his friend, which has moved MPs across all sides of the house. May was emotional too in her response. We\u2019ll post the full quotes shortly. MPs from all sides of the Commons have been praising Theresa May for the tone and the language she used in her statement to the Commons about the Westminster terror attack. It is routine for prime ministers to respond to terrorist killings by saying that democracy will prevail, but May delivered that message this morning with great dignity and sincerity. Here are the key points. May said that attacker was a British-born man who had been investigated in the past in relation to violent extremism, by only as \u201ca peripheral figure\u201d. But he had not been a current suspect, she said. His identity is known to the police and MI5, and when operational considerations allow, he will be publicly identified. What I can confirm is that the man was British born and that \u2013 some years ago \u2013 he was once investigated by M15 in relation to concerns about violent extremism. He was a peripheral figure. The case is historic \u2013 he was not part of the current intelligence picture. (The text issued by Number 10 says the attacker was \u201conce investigated in relation to concerns about violent extremism\u201d but in the chamber May said he was \u201conce investigated by MI5 in relation to concerns about violent extremism.\u201d) She said the attackerwas thought to have acted alone and that the police \u201chave no reason to believe there are imminent further attacks on the public\u201d. She said the \u201cworking assumption\u201d was that the attacker was \u201cinspired by Islamist ideology\u201d. She gave details of the nationalities of those injured on Westminster Bridge. Two people were killed and about 40 more were injured, she said: In addition to 12 Britons admitted to hospital, we know that the victims include three French children, two Romanians, four South Koreans, one German, one Pole, one Irish, one Chinese, one Italian, one American and two Greeks. She said the police would increase the number of patrols in cities \u201cas a precautionary measure\u201d. She described the attack as \u201can attack on free people everywhere\u201d. She said the \u201cbest response to terrorism\u201d was for people to carry with their lives as normal. It is in these actions \u2013 millions of acts of normality \u2013 that we find the best response to terrorism. A response that denies our enemies their victory. That refuses to let them win. That shows we will never give in. A response driven by that same spirit that drove a husband and father to put himself between us and our attacker, and to pay the ultimate price. A response that says to the men and women who propagate this hate and evil: you will not defeat us. One of the Edge Hill University students who was struck by the terrorist\u2019s 4x4 has this morning thanked the emergency services. Owen Lambert, 18, was on Westminster Bridge when the vehicle ploughed into pedestrians, killing two and leaving dozens more injured. Owen, who received stitches for a head wound, said on Thursday: \u201cBattered and bruised but doing fine, massive thanks to Metropolitan police and the Chelsea and Westminster hospital for helping me through this ordeal and an even bigger thanks to all my family and friends for supporting me every step of the way.\u201d His fellow student, Travis Frain, suffered a cracked rib plus hand and arm injuries. His mother, Angela Frain, said last night that he was \u201cOK\u201d and in \u201cgood spirits\u201d. He is expected to remain in hospital for several days. Responding to Corbyn, May paid tribute both to the support received from France and to the bravery of the police. She said France too had \u201cfelt the horror and trauma of terrible terrorist attacks.\u201d Police officers like Keith Palmer put their lives on the line every day, she said. Every day, when they put on that uniform, they don\u2019t know what they are going to confront in the course of their duties that day. It\u2019s a fact often forgotten when people see the police officer walking on the streets that actually they do put their lives on the line for our safety and security. They show enormous bravery and we are grateful to them all. Here is the statement from Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, where he called the attack \u201can appalling atrocity\u201d but urged people not to rush to judgment. What happened yesterday was an appalling atrocity. Today, we are united by our humanity, by our democratic values and by that human impulse for solidarity to stand together in times of darkness and adversity. I express my condolences to the family and friends of PC Keith Palmer, who gave his life yesterday in defence of the public and our democracy \u2013 and to the loved ones of those still in a critical condition including the French schoolchildren visiting our capital from Concarneau in Brittany. The injured include people of ten nationalities. Innocent people were killed yesterday walking across Westminster Bridge as many millions of Londoners and tourists have done before them. I thank all the dedicated NHS staff working to save lives, including those from St Thomas\u2019 Hospital who rushed out to help those in need. We are grateful for the public service workers who yesterday, today and every day they pull on their uniforms. It behoves us all not to rush to judgement, but to wait for the police to establish the facts. We must stay united in our communities and not to allow fear or the voices of hatred to divide or cower us. It is by demonstrating our values of solidarity, community, humanity and love that we will defeat the poison and division of hatred. The attacker rented a car from an Enterprise branch within the Birmingham city area, sources have told the Guardian. A spokesperson for Enterprise Holdings said: \u201cWe can confirm that the car used in the tragic attack in London yesterday afternoon was one of ours. \u201cAn employee identified the vehicle after seeing the licence plate in an image online. We ran another check to verify, and immediately contacted the authorities. \u201cWe are cooperating fully with the authorities and will provide any assistance that we can to the investigation. \u201cOur thoughts are very much with the victims of this terrible tragedy.\u201d Angus Robertson, the SNP Westminster leader, praised the prime minister for her statement. Today of all days we are reminded that, notwithstanding our differences on political and constitutional issues, we are as one in our dedication to democracy, the rule of law and harmony between peoples of all faiths and none. Does she agree with me that no terrorist outrage is representative of any faith or faith community and we recommit ourselves to strengthening the bonds of tolerance and understanding? In the days to come I hope we will remember the love and bravery of the victim, not just the hatred and cowardice of the attackers. Others paying tribute in the house include the former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith, former cabinet minister Theresa Villiers, former Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman and Lib Dem leader Tim Farron. Here are more extracts from Theresa May\u2019s statement. Since June 2013 our police, security and intelligence agencies have successfully disrupted 13 separate terrorist plots in Britain. Mr Speaker, in terms of security here in Westminster, we should be clear first of all that an attacker attempted to break into Parliament and was shot dead within twenty yards of the gates. If his intention was to gain access to this building, we should be clear that he did not succeed.The police heroically did their job. But as is routine, the police together with the House authorities are reviewing the security of the Parliamentary estate, co-ordinated with the Cabinet Office, who have responsibility for the security measures in place around the Government secure zone. All of us in this House have a responsibility for the security and safety of our staff and advice is available for Members who need it. Mr Speaker, yesterday we saw the worst of humanity, but we will remember the best. We will remember the extraordinary efforts to save the life of PC Keith Palmer, including those by my Rt Hon Friend the Member for Bournemouth East. And we will remember the exceptional bravery of our police, security and emergency services who once again ran towards the danger even as they encouraged others to move the other way ... Mr Speaker, a lot has been said since terror struck London yesterday. Much more will be said in the coming days. But the greatest response lies not in the words of politicians, but in the everyday actions of ordinary people. For beyond these walls today \u2013 in scenes repeated in towns and cities across the country \u2013millions of people are going about their days and getting on with their lives. The streets are as busy as ever. The offices full. The coffee shops and cafes bustling. As I speak millions will be boarding trains and aeroplanes to travel to London, and to see for themselves the greatest city on Earth. It is in these actions \u2013 millions of acts of normality \u2013 that we find the best response to terrorism. A response that denies our enemies their victory. That refuses to let them win. That shows we will never give in. A response driven by that same spirit that drove a husband and father to put himself between us and our attacker, and to pay the ultimate price. A response that says to the men and women who propagate this hate and evil: you will not defeat us. Mr Speaker, let this be the message from this House and this nation today: our values will prevail. And I commend this statement to the House. Here are key extracts from Theresa May\u2019s statement. Yesterday an act of terrorism tried to silence our democracy. But today we meet as normal, as generations have done before us and as future generations will continue to do, to deliver a simple message: we are not afraid and our resolve will never waver in the face ofterrorism. And we meet here in the oldest of all parliaments because we know democracy and the values it entails will always prevail. Those values free speech, liberty, human rights and rule of law are embodied here in this place and shared by free people around the world. A terrorist came to the place where people of all nationalities and culture gather to celebrate what it means to be free. He took out his rage indiscriminately on men, women and children. This was an attack on free people everywhere and on behalf of the British people I would like to thank our friends and allies around the world who have made it clear they stand with us. What happened on the streets of Westminster sickened us all. While there is an ongoing police investigation, the House will understand there are limits to what I can say but having been updated by police and security officials let me set out what at this stage I can tell the house. At approximately 2.40pm yesterday a single attacker drove his vehicle at speed into innocent pedestrians crossing Westminster Bridge, killing two people and injuring around 40 more. In addition to 12 Britons admitted to hospital, we know the victims include three French children, two Romanians, four South Koreans, one German, one Pole, one Irish, one Chinese, one Italian, one American and two Greeks. We are in close contacts with the governments of the countries of all those affected. The injured also included three police officers returning from an event to recognise their bravery ... Two of those three remain in a serious condition. The attacker then left the vehicle and approached a police officer at Carriage Gates, attacking that officer with a large knife before he was shot dead by an armed police officer. Tragically 48 year old PC Keith Palmer was killed. He was every inch a hero and his actions will never be forgotten. I can confirm police have searched six addresses and made eight arrests in Birmingham and London. It is still believed this attacker acted alone and police have no reason to believe there are imminent further attacks on the public. His identity is known to the police and MI5. When operational considerations allow he will be publicly identified. What I can confirm is the man was British born and that some years ago he was once investigated by MI5 in relation to concerns about violent extremism. He was a peripheral figure. The case is historic. He is not part of the current intelligence picture. There was no prior intelligence of his intent or the plot. Intensive investigations continue \u2026 Our working assumption is that the attacker was inspired by Islamist ideology. We know the threat from Islamist terrorism is very real. But while the public should remain utterly vigilant they should not and will not be cowed by this threat. We are stepping up policing to reassure the public and as a precautionary measure it will mean increasing patrols in cities across the country, with more police and more armed police on the streets. Corbyn says the injured include people from 10 nationalities. We send them our best wishes, he says. He urges people to look after each other, to help one another and think of one another. It is by looking after each other that we will defeat the poison and hatred. Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, is responding. He says we are united by the human impulse of solidarity. He praises PC Keith Palmer. We thank the police who keep us safe, he says. The police and security staff lost a colleague, but continue to do their duty. We see the police every day, he says. When dangerous incidents take place, we run away. But they run towards danger, he says. He also praises Tobias Ellwood for using his skill yesterday to try to save PC Palmer\u2019s life. John Bercow says MPs have been joined today in the gallery by the French foreign minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault. Bercow says that MPs appreciate his presence and solidarity. May says yesterday we saw the worst of humanity. But we will remember the best. We will remember the efforts to save PC Keith Palmer\u2019s life, including by Tobias Ellwood. She pays tribute to the emergency services. That they have lost one of their own only makes their calmness and professionalism all the more remarkable. She says the greatest response lies in the actions of ordinary people. Millions of people are going about their ordinary lives, she says. People will be boarding buses and trains to come to London as she speaks, she says, to see the best city on earth. This is the response that shows we will never give in to terrorism. It is the same spirit that drove a husband and father to put himself between us and th attack, and to pay the ultimate price. Let this be the message for us today; our values will prevail. May says she chaired a Cobra committee last night. The threat level remains at \u201csevere\u201d. That means an attack is highly likely. But it will not be raised to the next level, because there is no intelligence that an attack is imminent. She says police have been working through the night to establish all they can about the attack. They have searched six addresses in London and Birmingham and eight people have been arrested. May says the attacker was \u201cBritish-born\u201d May says attacker was known to MI5. He was investigated some years ago in relation to extremist terrorism. But he was a \u201cperipheral figure\u201d. May says there is a limit to what she can say because of the police investigation. But she can set out the basic facts. She says an attacker drove a car at pedestrians on Westminster Bridge. Those injured include: 12 Britons, three French, two Romanians, four South Koreans, one German, one Chinese, one Irish, one Italian, one American and two Greeks. Then the attacker tried to enter parliament. PC Keith Palmer was killed. Theresa May is speaking now. She says a terrorist attack tried to disrupt democracy yesterday. But today MPs are carrying on as usual. This was an attack on free people everywhere, she says. She thanks friends around the world who have said they stand by the UK. The events sickened us all, she says. John Bercow, the Speaker, is making his own statement first. He expresses condolences to the family and friends of victims of this outrage. He says PC Keith Palmer was killed defending MPs, parliament and parliamentary democracy. Our hearts go out to all those touched by events yesterday. He thanks staff of the Commons and MPs\u2019 staff for their forbearance. He says steps have been taken to keep the Commons safe. In time the House of Commons commission, and its Lords counterpart, will review if more needs to be done. He says the house has been able to carry on its business today undisturbed. Two patients are being treated at St Thomas\u2019 hospital following yesterday\u2019s security incident in Westminster \u2013 one man and one woman. Both patients are in a stable condition. Amanda Pritchard, the chief executive of Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS foundation trust, said: I would like to thank all staff who were involved in the response to the terrible event yesterday. The Trust\u2019s major incident procedures have worked well, and there has been an excellent response from both clinical and non-clinical staff. My thoughts are with all affected by this appalling tragedy. Theresa May is about to address MPs. The Metropolitan police and the parliamentary authorities are reviewing security arrangements around the Palace of Westminster after a knife-wielding terrorist was able to access the estate. Focus will fall upon Carriage Gates, the vehicle entrance opening on to Parliament Square that is usually used by vehicles bearing ministers and selected staff. Witnesses said the attacker crashed his car into the estate\u2019s fence before running through Carriage Gates carrying two knives. He is said to have fatally attacked PC Keith Palmer, one of the unarmed officers patrolling near the gates, before being gunned down by armed officers. Unarmed officers such as PC Palmer act as the public face of parliament at the entrance, whose imposing iron gates are the symbol of the estate. These officers are not just the first line of defence but are often seen posing for pictures with tourists keen to take their photographs with a clear view of Elizabeth Tower, known as Big Ben. Any review will examine procedures at the gates, which are often left unlocked or ajar because they are in frequent use. Armed officers are usually seen several yards behind the unarmed officers. But just 50 yards beyond them on the other side of New Palace Yard, MPs and ministers can be seen frequently walking to and fro from parliament\u2019s offices and the House of Commons\u2019 chamber. The dilemma for the security forces and the parliamentary authorities has been the same since the building was first established on the banks of the Thames in the 11th century: how to provide safety without infringing the right of the public to turn up and lobby their constituency MP. A senior parliamentary officer confirmed this morning that a security review is under way.The details of the review will remain confidential. There are already airport-style checks at some parliamentary entrances,including those at St Stephen\u2019s Gate and Portcullis House, the new building housing most MPs\u2019 offices. There are no such checks at Carriage Gates. The Metropolitan Police Federation is launching a memorial fund for PC Keith Palmer. The Just Giving page is being set up because of pleas from Federation members who wanted to help in some way, chairman Ken Marsh said. He said: \u201cThat\u2019s why we are doing it, because of the overwhelming amount of our colleagues asking for it.\u201d Here is a link. The Metropolitan police say eight people have now been arrested in connection with the attack. Earlier (see 7.59am) they said there had been seven arrests. The Conservative MP Gavin Barwell has written a good post about yesterday\u2019s attack on his blog . Here\u2019s an extract. It was also an attack on your parliament. Make no mistake: it is your parliament. One of my favourite parts of the job is showing constituents around the building. Although sadly it behaves like a private members club at times, it is the place where the people you choose to represent you come together to decide how we should go forward as a country. For all its faults, it is at the centre of our national life and that is why it was targeted yesterday ... I spent nearly five hours yesterday locked in the chamber and voting lobbies of the House of Commons with about 350 other MPs. We watched the news on TV, shared mobile phone chargers so that we could reassure loved ones we were ok and talked about the work we do. It was a reminder that although we spend most of our time arguing about Brexit, austerity, the future of our Union and so many other things, those arguments obscure the fact that there is more that unites us than divides us. We are all committed to democracy, to the idea that the way we resolve our differences is through debate, sometime passionate argument, but never violence. If politics sometimes frustrates you (it certainly frustrates me at times), that is something worth holding onto, indeed something worth giving your life to defend - as PC Keith Palmer did so heroically yesterday. The Scottish parliament\u2019s debate and vote on calling for a new independence referendum will resume on Tuesday 28 March \u2013 the day before Theresa May triggers article 50 to begin the Brexit process. That vote on Tuesday evening will almost certainly give Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, Holyrood\u2019s approval to ask May for the legal powers to stage the referendum just before the prime minister begins the process for leaving the UK. The final 90 minutes of debate and the vote on Sturgeon\u2019s referendum motion, plus four opposition party amendments, were suspended at 15.55 on Wednesday in solidarity with the Westminster parliament after the terror attacks. With its flags flying at half mast, Holyrood\u2019s business bureau met on Thursday morning but opted not to abandon today\u2019s sessions to resume the referendum debate immediately. Instead, there will be a ministerial statement on childcare and a debate on British sign language. French authorities have launched an inquiry into the London attack after it became clear three French schoolchildren were wounded, two of them seriously. The counter-terrorism section of the Paris public prosecutor\u2019s office has opened an investigation into \u201cattempted assassination related to a terrorist enterprise\u201d. The investigation, which is standard procedure in France when French nationals are victims of violence abroad, is in the hands of the DGSI internal intelligence agency. The children were part of a group on a week-long visit to London from the Saint-Joseph de Concarneau lyc\u00e9e in Brittany. About a dozen members of the group, aged 15 to 16, are believed to have been on Westminster Bridge when the Hyundai car ploughed into them. The Commons is now sitting in the normal way. Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, is taking questions. It is not quite \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d, because some of the roads around the Houses of Parliament remain closed, and New Palace Yard, where PC Keith Palmer was stabbed, is still being treated as a crime scene, and forensic officers are currently at work on the site. But MPs, peers and other who work on the parliamentary estate (such as journalists like myself) have been able to come into the building without hindrance. There is already concern that policing is being stretched by the extra resources needed after the Westminster attack. Those extra demands are affecting not only the Met but forces outside the capital. In one force outside London, firearms officers finished an extended shift late on Wednesday, only to be recalled for an early start on Thursday. Annual leave has been cancelled and officers are working extended shift patterns, up from eight hours to about 12 hours and sometimes more. MacKey says he was a witness to the attack on PC Palmer and said it was his duty to secure his evidence before taking over the lead on the investigation. MacKey urges anyone in the city if they are concerned or worried to approach the police and talk to them. His voice is cracking as he says the response is large and covers all of London and all parts of national government. MacKey says the work done over many years, practising for scenarios like this, has helped but nothing prepares families for when events like this happen. He will attend the cabinet\u2019s Cobra committee later this morning. Craig Mackey, the Met\u2019s acting commissioner, is speaking now to gathered staff and journalists. He says the support of Londoners has been invaluable and ensures the police can do the job they are entrusted to do. Mackey says he is leading the response and the investigation is ongoing. A service is now taking place in front of Scotland Yard, in front of the flame that burns as a tribute to all dead Metropolitan police officers. A pray is being read by the Met\u2019s chaplain, Rev Jonathan Osborne. Cressida Dick, the incoming Met commissioner, Craig Mackay, the acting commissioner and other officers held a minute\u2019s silence in front of the \u201ceternal flame\u201d alight outside New Scotland Yard on Victoria embankment, within sight of Westminster bridge. The new headquarters was set to be formally opened by the Queen on Thursday but the ceremony was cancelled. The Commons chamber is packed. MPs are standing to observe the silence. At Westminster a minute\u2019s silence is being observed in honour of the victims of yesterday\u2019s attack. The Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron was outside Portcullis House, the building which houses MPs offices just next to the Houses of Parliament, as the chaos unfolded on Westminster Bridge. He said he was meeting his local hospital trust but was about to head to the chamber when the division bell rang for a vote, via the underground tunnel which links two buildings. As we went underneath, it was clear the sea of people had suddenly reversed and was heading the other way. There was a noise, retrospectively you might think it was a bang or gunshot but I couldn\u2019t say for sure. Farron left the building via the MPs\u2019 exit on to the embankment. He said he saw the horror but also \u201camazing things, the running towards danger of staff at St Thomas\u201d. Let\u2019s not forget, not least the sacrifice of Keith Palmer, but the others who came to the aid of those suffering, even though doing so was putting themselves in harm\u2019s way. Yesterday the anti-immigrant right, which in the past has sought to use terror attacks to justify its political stance, was generally silent. The Ukip leader Paul Nuttall put out a statement including a line saying \u201cin the coming hours and days more information will doubtlessly emerge about the attacker or attackers and their motivation\u201d but the press release focused on praising the emergency services and expressing sympathy for the victims. This morning, though, Leave.EU, the leave campaign run by the Nigel Farage ally and onetime Ukip donor Arron Banks, has put out a lengthy statement essentially blaming the attack on mass immigration. It says: We are sick, tired but perhaps even more so we are angry that recent governments across Europe have enabled these attacks through grossly negligible policies that have left us vulnerable. How many times must we #PrayForNice? For Brussels? Berlin? Paris? London? The list is endless. The statement is not attributed to anyone by name. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has issued an open invitation to all Londoners and visitors to the capital to a candlelight vigil in Trafalgar Square from 6pm this evening. This is the statement from City Hall: The mayor is asking everyone to come together in solidarity to remember those who have lost their lives, to express sympathy with their families and loved ones and to show the world that we are more committed than ever to the values that we hold dear \u2013 that we remain united and open. London is the greatest city in the world. We will never be cowed by terrorism. We stand together, in the face of those who seek to harm us and destroy our way of life. We always have, and we always will. West Midlands police have confirmed arrests were made at the addresses raided in Birmingham. A statement from the force said the arrests and searches were intelligence-led and there was no immediate risk to public safety. Extra officers will be out on patrol throughout the next few days in Birmingham, the force said. WMP\u2019s assistant chief constable Marcus Beale, who leads on counter-terrorism for the force, said: We work tirelessly to counter terrorism. Our absolute priority is to ensure the safety and security of the people who live, work and visit the West Midlands area. Our policing tactics and security measures are being reviewed on a daily basis \u2013 we, along with our partners, are working around the clock to keep Birmingham and our other cities as safe as can be. Birmingham has long been home to violent jihadis attracted to plotting and supporting terrorism. The chief constable of the West Midlands, Dave Thompson, has said that the area was second only to London for the number of terror plots linked to it. In a Guardian interview last year, Thompson said the rise of Isis, which he referred to as Daesh, had led to a very high \u201cintensity and determination\u201d of terrorist threat, he said. Thompson said there were differences between how al-Qaida had tried to attract British recruits and Isis\u2019s approach. Key to this was Isis\u2019s declaration of a hardline, pan-national Islamist state. There is something around the concept of Daesh, the concept of a caliphate that is drawing people to that. And I think there is a greater sophistication in the approach taken to radicalise people through more digital means, and I think that has driven a different face of the challenge we\u2019ve faced over the last few years.\u201d The Hagley Road area of Bearwood, where one raid by police took place, is close to the Birmingham city centre, barely a mile away. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has been giving interviews about the Westminster attack this morning. Here are some of the points he made. Khan refused to directly hit back at Donald Trump Jr, who used a tweet yesterday to criticise Khan for a comment he made last year about terror attacks being \u201cpart and parcel of living in a big city\u201d. Trump\u2019s comments have been strongly criticised. Here is the tweet. Asked about this tweet Khan said: I\u2019m not going to respond to tweets by Donald Trump. What I will say is this: the threat level in London and our country remains the same. It\u2019s severe. That means, according to the experts, an attack is highly likely. The commissioner who just retired said last year that, as far as an attack was concerned, it was a matter of when, not if. Thankfully the police and security services practise for such incidents. One, I\u2019m afraid, happened yesterday. He said policing in London was constantly evolving as new threats emerged. One of the reasons I believe our police service, our security services, are the best in the world is we evolve and adapt as the terrorists, those who seek to harm us, evolve and adapt and find new ways to kill us and destroy our way of live. So you have seen across London bollards, in lay person\u2019s terms, for the additional security measures that have been taken over the last couple of years now. You have seen the additional searches done by the police when it comes to vehicles and when it comes to intelligence-led stop and search. That\u2019s going to carry on. And you will see over the last 24 hours additional measures taken. He said we must not let terrorists destroy our way of life. We must never accept terrorists being successful. We must never accept that terrorists can destroy our life or destroy the way we lead our lives. We must never accept politicians not being accessible to the public. We must never accept a situation where people try and divide Christians, Jews, Muslims, Sikhs, Hindus from each other, of those who are not members of organised faiths. We must never accept a situation where people can incite hatred against people because of the faith they belong to. When you think about why terrorists want to attack London, it\u2019s because they hate the fact that we don\u2019t simply tolerate each other, whether you are a Christian, Muslim, Jew, Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, member of an organised faith or not, we respect, embrace and celebrate each other. And that\u2019s going to carry on. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow. I will be blogging today with my colleague Jessica Elgot, who has been running the blog until now. The Guardian\u2019s Scotland editor, Severin Carrell, reports that Holyrood will hold a minute\u2019s silence this morning. Here is the full interview from defence secretary Michael Fallon this morning. Fallon says the belief is that the man was motivated by international terrorism Their working assumption this is linked to Islamic terrorism but they don\u2019t yet know and the investigation - and it is a very large investigation - has been underway since it happened. Fallon said attacks are not part of normal life but London was clearly a target police were preparing for The current warning is at severe - that an attack - and that has been the case for sometime, is likely but not imminent. There is no specific information about other attacks and let me emphasise today although there is intense security around palace of Westminster, London is going to work this morning, I passed school children going to school, there are school trips going ahead, parliament itself will resume at the normal time at half past nine. Fallon said it was not the case that police could not prevent \u201clow tech\u201d attacks but admitted it was more difficult. The police and agencies that we rely on for our security have forestalled a large number of these attacks in recent years over a dozen last year. Now of course this kind of attack, this lone wolf attack, things from daily life - a vehicle, a knife are much more difficult to forestall - and we are dealing with a terrorist enemy that is not making demands or holding people hostage but just to kill as many people as possible. This is a new element to international terrorism but our forces are working extremely hard to identify those that are involved to this and I have every confidence they will be able to track down the associates of this particular man. Fallon said police had to work on the assumption others may have helped prepare the attack. The police have to proceed on the presumption that he may well have been assisted in this task - there may have been others involved - they have been working right through the night looking into his background, how he got hold of vehicle and who or where the vehicle has been in the last day or two and he may or may not have been helped. He also insists it is not the case that the security of parliament was breached, and that is down to the bravery of PC Keith Palmer at carriage gate. In paying tribute to PC Keith Palmer, they did not get into parliament, they only got as far as the gate, they did not breach the security of the House of Commons - he gave his life to protect our democracy. Parliament cannot be hermetically sealed, people are coming and going all the time, there was a division in place in the House of Commons at that time - people arriving at the gates by car or foot to vote on that. But obviously this is something that will be reviewed by the House authorities. Fallon also said the cabinet had reviewed at the Cobr meeting whether the Metropolitan police had all the resources they need, including military back-up to deal with situations like that. There have been increases in the budgets of security services - we will continue to keep that under review. I want to reassure you that the police and security sources will have resources they need. A minute\u2019s silence will take place in parliament, just after the start of business this morning. I\u2019m joined by my colleague Andrew Sparrow in Westminster now, he\u2019ll be taking charge of events today in Westminster while I monitor developments in the investigations. You can get in touch with either of us via Twitter, @jessicaelgot and @AndrewSparrow. A teacher and mother of two was among those who died in Wednesday\u2019s terror attack in London, it has emerged. Aysha Frade, 43, who worked as a teacher in London, had family in the town of Betanzos, Galicia in north-west Spain. The mayor of Betanzos, Ram\u00f3n Garc\u00eda V\u00e1zquez, confirmed Frade\u2019s death, saying he had been informed early on Thursday morning. \u201cThe rumours that started going round last night are sadly true,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cI didn\u2019t know her but she has two sisters who run an English school here and other relatives in the area. It\u2019s a tragedy.\u201d Sir Michael Fallon, the defence secretary, told the Today programme: The police are investigating this man, his associates where he came from, checking urgently whether other people were involved in this, their working assumption is it\u2019s linked to Islamic terrorism. But they don\u2019t yet know, the investigation - and it is a very large investigation - has been underway ever since the incident started. Sir Michael Fallon, the defence secretary, has been speaking to Radio 4 Today. He said police \u201cworking assumption is that this is linked to islamic terrorism\u201d. Police had been working through the night, he said. Fallon says he will not rule out that the attack was directed from overseas, but says all options are being looked at. They [police] don\u2019t yet have a full enough picture of the man and his known associates who may or may not have helped him prepare the attack. Fallon says he has passed many people going to work as normal in London this morning, including pupils on school trips, and says parliament will sit as normal at 9.30am. London has seen this before and is taking it on the chin. Hoyle says he does not want to get into any changes in security, but says he will be chairing the review when it happens. \u201cWe have a duty of care to everyone, including to staff and to you [journalists],\u201d he said. The deputy speaker Lindsay Hoyle, who announced the attack to MPs in the chamber yesterday afternoon, has been speaking to Sky News this morning. We had the information an attack was taking place outside, so we asked \u2018how serious?\u2019 \u2018Really serious.\u2019 So we suspended the sitting immediately, and we were partway through a division [a vote] so there were a lot of MPs in the chamber, which was good news. Of course, then we went into complete lockdown and no one can go in or out, which is the best thing to happen. Hoyle said he was devastated by the death of PC Keith Palmer. We lost one of our own, one of the village policemen. This is our village, to lose a person we all know, is not acceptable. Our thoughts are with his family and the other victims of this hideous crime. People are doing their duty, he has lost his life serving us and it\u2019s a tragedy that should never have happened. We have got to not give into terrorism. We will pay tribute to what has gone and that tragedy that took place yesterday, but we will not give into terrorism, and it will never, ever win. Hoyle said MPs greet the police officers every day and get to know them well. They look after us, they put the safety of the house first, they gave their lives to defend democracy. It will be business as usual, but not quite as usual. Innocent victims, tourists, people going about their business, mown down by a car. These despots will never win. We will stand together and stand firm. Hoyle says he feels safe every day in parliament. \u201cWe have the best police force in the world \u2026 we have great people who look after us and our head of security is second to none and proved it yesterday,\u201d he said. \u201cWe lost someone but no one got into parliament.\u201d MPs are returning to work now in parliament. Jess Phillips, the chair of the women\u2019s PLP, said that the group of Labour\u2019s female politicians had met the day before with the deputy speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, and the head of security in parliament to talk about safety. \u201cThe feeling in the room was very much that we felt safe on the estate. We had more concerns about random attacks in our constituency. During the attack the very next day the security was tested and the feeling of all the MPs inside and outside the building was that still we felt safe,\u201d she said. Phillips described the \u201ccalm, professional but forceful way the doorkeepers, security staff and police handled the situation\u201d to keep staff, MPs and visiting schoolchildren and guests safe. \u201cToday we will attend a statement to honour Keith Palmer, but to honour him and the sacrifice he made for us we will keep going to our constituency meetings and parliament debates.\u201d Good morning from London. Here\u2019s what we know from the most recent statement from Scotland Yard\u2019s acting deputy commissioner Mark Rowley. Rowley revised down the death toll \u2013 four people killed in the attack in Westminster yesterday, including the killer and parliament police officer Keith Palmer. Two other victims, who Rowley said were a mix of nationalities, were killed on Westminster bridge, a man and a woman. This morning, there are 29 people being treated in hospital, seven in a critical condition, which is also revised down from yesterday, when police said 40 were injured. Police have searched six addresses in Birmingham, London and other parts of the country, and made seven arrests. They believe this attacker \u201cacted alone and inspired by international terrorism\u201d. Rowley said he had no specific information about any further risk to the public, but repeated that more officers were on the streets - armed and unarmed - and that many had leave cancelled or were working extended hours. The area is a \u201clarge and complex crime scene\u201d that officers are still working on. Rowley said he would not identify the attacker or other victims at this stage - because the victims were a mix of nationalities. He said he realised journalists would be investigating too, but asked them not to name the attacker. I\u2019m handing over the blog now to my colleague Jessica Elgot, who\u2019ll continue to bring you latest news on the attack, as MPs return to Westminster. Rowley reiterates that police believe the attacker acted alone. He asks the media not to name him while investigations are ongoing. Rowley says he will not confirm whether the attacker was a British national. He declines to give any further detail on others killed and injured. Rowley says investigations are continuing and says he will not be identifying the attacker yet. He confirms that related arrests have been made in Birmingham, London and elsewhere. Seven arrests were made at six addresses, he says. Mark Rowley, acting deputy commissioner at the Met, is speaking now outside Scotland Yard. Four people are dead and 29 treated in five hospitals across London. Seven are in a critical condition. This is a revised death toll \u2013 last night police said five had died. The four are PC Keith Palmer, two members of the public \u2013 a woman in her mid-40s, and a man in his mid-50s \u2013 and the attacker. We are expecting an update imminently from the Metropolitan police; we\u2019ll have coverage live here when it begins. MPs are heading in to work today in understandably sombre mood: Cressida Dick, the incoming Metropolitan police commissioner, has praised the bravery of officers involved in the Westminster attack, Press Association reports: In a message to staff, Dick, who takes up the job next month, described Wednesday as a \u201ctragic day for London and the Met\u201d. Dick, who visited New Scotland Yard last night, said: One of our officers died protecting the public and parliament. We will never forget his courage. My deepest sympathy is with his family and with the loved ones of everyone who lost their lives. My thoughts too are with the members of the public and our officers who were injured as well as those people affected by these appalling events. As many parliamentarians have noted, our officers ran towards danger to do their jobs. We are indebted to their bravery. Officers and staff from the Metropolitan police are working as hard as we can to protect the public and our capital city. I am grateful for all their efforts. Brendan Cox \u2013 whose wife, Labour MP Jo Cox, was the last person to be killed by terrorism in the UK before yesterday\u2019s attack \u2013 is speaking now to the BBC Today programme. He says he would like to caution against \u201cgiving notoriety to the person who did it \u2026 I would much rather remember the heroes \u2026 talking about them is how we do justice\u201d. This is a story about people who didn\u2019t come home yesteday and the impact this will have on their familes \u2026 the individual tragedies. He says he \u201chated\u201d seeing pictures of the man who killed his wife in the days and weeks after her murder: Of course, there\u2019s going to be reporting on who did it, why he did it, his twisted ideology, but I\u2019m going to remember PC Palmer. Reactions to the attack should be directed at extremism, he added: The person who did this is no more representative of Muslims than the person who killed Jo is representative of people in Yorkshire. Frank Gardner, the BBC\u2019s security correspondent, is speaking on the Today programme. He says it appears the raid in Birmingham is linked to the investigation into the Westminster attack: The indications are that the car began its journey in Birmingham \u2026 An address was raided by armed officers. There are reports that a number of arrests were made at the address. Police have not yet commented. West Midlands police have directed media inquiries to Scotland Yard. The prime minister will give a statement to parliament later this morning, which will also allow MPs to question her about the event. The aim is for parliament to return to normal today, in an attempt to prevent this attack from disrupting the work of either the Commons or Lords, although school trips will be cancelled. The government will first be represented by the defence secretary, Michael Fallon, this morning, followed by May. Speaking on Wednesday evening, Theresa May said the attack was an assault on democracy: The location of this attack was no accident. The terrorists chose to strike at the heart of our capital city, where people of all nationalities, religions and cultures come together to celebrate the values of liberty, democracy and freedom of speech. These streets of Westminster \u2013 home to the world\u2019s oldest parliament \u2013 are engrained with a spirit of freedom that echoes in some of the furthest corners of the globe. And the values our parliament represents \u2013 democracy, freedom, human rights, the rule of law \u2013 command the admiration and respect of free people everywhere. That is why it is a target for those who reject those values. But let me make it clear today, as I have had cause to do before: any attempt to defeat those values through violence and terror is doomed to failure. The BBC and Sky News are reporting that a number of arrests have been made in Birmingham, in a police raid believed to be connected to the attack in London. The arrests \u2013 and any potential link \u2013 have not been confirmed by the police. BBC Newsnight reported late on Wednesday evening that the car used in the attack could have been rented in Birmingham. The Guardian has not been able to verify this report. West Midlands police has said of the raid that saw Hagley Road in south-west Birmingham closed for around two hours overnight: There is an ongoing police operation, no further details are being given at this stage. WMP referred media inquiries to the Metropolitan police in London, which said it would not be commenting for \u201coperational reasons\u201d. An update from the Met is expected within the next two hours. The attack outside the Houses of Parliament in London is the latest in a series of terrorist atrocities involving a vehicle being driven at speed into pedestrians \u2013 a tactic actively promoted by Islamic State. In December, a refugee in Germany drove a truck into a market in Berlin, killing 12. Last July, a stolen truck driven through a Bastille Day parade in Nice killed 86. The strikes appear inspired, if not actively commissioned, by Isis in Iraq and Syria. In November, a student used a vehicle and knives to injure 13 on a campus in Ohio, in the US. His motives and allegiance are less clear. Such attacks are not unprecedented, but have become much more numerous in recent years. In 2014, the chief spokesman of the group, Mohammed al-Adnani, issued a call for sympathisers in the west to strike \u201cunbelievers\u201d, especially police officers or soldiers, where they were \u2013 rather than travel to the middle east to fight there. \u201cIf you are not able to find a bomb or a bullet, then smash his head with a rock, or slaughter him with a knife, or run him over with your car, or throw him down from a high place, or choke him, or poison him,\u201d he said. Though al-Adnani, who was killed in 2016, pointed a finger specifically at France, where there were two vehicle attacks in 2014, he also cited the UK among preferred targets. Thursday\u2019s front pages are, of course, dominated by the attack in London. You can see our roundup here. Many focus on MP Tobias Ellwood\u2019s unsuccessful fight to save the life of PC Keith Palmer; others have chosen to picture the attacker, stretchered away after he was shot by armed officers. Here is the Guardian front page today: Police have said 40 people were injured in the attack, many of them as the assailant drove his car deliberately into pedestrians on Westminster bridge. Some are seriously wounded. The death toll rose on Wednesday evening, with four victims \u2013 three members of the public, who have not been named, and the police officer PC Keith Palmer \u2013 and the attacker confirmed to have died. Many of those injured remain in hospitals across London, including St Thomas\u2019, King\u2019s College and St Mary\u2019s. Two teenage French students were in a critical condition in hospital after being struck on the bridge. A third student was also being treated for injuries. One of the three had been thrown on to the bonnet of a car. Five South Korean tourists, four students from Ormskirk\u2019s Edge Hill University, and a German woman resident in Australia have been identified as among the wounded. Three police officers on the way back from a commendation ceremony \u2013 one of whom is thought to have suffered head injuries \u2013 and a Romanian couple were also among those hurt on the bridge. Here\u2019s a roundup of our latest reporting on the attack: Full report: police officer among five dead in \u2018sick and depraved\u2019 incident London attack: what we know so far \u2018Solidarity and support\u2019: world leaders send wishes after attack Tobias Ellwood MP hailed for attempting to save officer\u2019s life MPs honour the memory of murdered PC Keith Palmer \u2018All hell was let loose\u2019: witnesses on the Westminster attack #WeAreNotAfraid: Londoners send out message after terror attack Analysis and commentary is here: Ewen MacAskill: Lone attackers are the biggest challenge for security services Jason Burke: Crude nature of attack suggests limited Isis network in Britain The Guardian view: Solidarity against terror Jonathan Freedland: Bravery and simple humanity show Westminster at its best John Crace: The numbing afternoon when I saw a police officer die outside parliament Theresa May spent Wednesday afternoon being briefed on the details of the attack before chairing a meeting of Cobra, the emergency committee. The committee could meet again on Thursday morning before May addresses MPs in the House of Commons, which will sit as usual. The home secretary, Amber Rudd, and the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, were both overseas yesterday \u2013 in Pakistan and the US, respectively \u2013 but Rudd is returning. The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, attended the Cobra meeting, and is expected to make a fresh statement on Thursday. Police have not named the attacker, who died after being shot by armed police inside the Westminster security cordon. Speaking late on Wednesday evening, the Metropolitan police acting deputy commissioner, Mark Rowley, said investigators believe they know the man\u2019s identity. He said the man was likely to have been acting alone, but confirmed they believed he was \u201cinspired by international terrorism\u201d, later clarifying that this referred to Islamist extremism. MPs have been paying tribute to PC Keith Palmer, who was fatally stabbed within the Westminster security cordon. Conservative MP James Cleverly said he was a former army comrade of Palmer: \u201cI\u2019ve known Keith for 25 years. We served together in the Royal Artillery before he became a copper. A lovely man, a friend. I\u2019m heartbroken. My thoughts are with the family, friends and colleagues of PC Keith Palmer. A brave man.\u201d Home affairs select committee chair and Labour MP Yvette Cooper, who was in parliament when the terrorist attacked, said: \u201cThank you PC Keith Palmer \u2013 to your bravery many others owe their lives and safety.\u201d Liverpool Wavertree MP Luciana Berger said: \u201cMay PC Keith Palmer rest in peace. He died protecting our democracy. My sincerest condolences to all of his family and friends.\u201d Parliament will resume today after Wednesday\u2019s terrorist attack in the capital. Here is what we now know: Five people are now confirmed to have died in the attack on Westminster on Wednesday: one police officer, three members of the public, and the attacker. The police officer has been named as PC Keith Palmer, 48, a member of the parliamentary and diplomatic protection command, with 15 years\u2019 service in the force. He was unarmed. Metropolitan police acting deputy commissioner Mark Rowley said Palmer was a husband and father: He was someone who left for work today expecting to return home at the end of his shift and he had every right to expect that would happen. The other victims of the attack, and the assailant, have not yet been named. Police said 40 other people were injured; many remain in hospital, some in a serious condition. Five South Korean tourists, four students from Ormskirk\u2019s Edge Hill University, and a German woman resident in Australia have been identified as among the wounded. Investigators say they believe they know the identity of the attacker, and that he is thought to have acted alone but was \u201cinspired by international terrorism\u201d. The House of Commons will sit this morning, with prime minister Theresa May saying the country would not be cowed: Parliament will meet as normal. We will come together as normal. And Londoners \u2013 and others from around the world who have come here to visit this great city \u2013 will get up and go about their day as normal. They will board their trains, they will leave their hotels, they will walk these streets, they will live their lives. And we will all move forward together. Never giving in to terror. And never allowing the voices of hate and evil to drive us apart. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, echoed her comments, saying: London is the greatest city in the world and we stand together in the face of those who seek to harm us and destroy our way of life. UK foreign minister Boris Johnson, who is in the US for an international meeting discussing the Isis threat, said: Heartbreaking. This is not the first attack on London or our Parliament \u2013 and won\u2019t be the last \u2013 but our values will prevail. The terror threat level for the UK remains unchanged, at \u201csevere\u201d. The Metropolitan police said extra patrols, armed and unarmed, would be in place, \u201cparticularly in crowded places and iconic locations\u201d. The Queen has postponed a planned visit to Scotland Yard that was due to take place today. Roads around Parliament Square remain closed, as does Westminster Bridge, as police investigations continue. Overnight, a police raid took place in the south-west of Birmingham. It is not clear if it is connected to the attack in London.",

They know they cannot stop every attack but there is still a sense of devastation when it happens.</p> \n  <p>There will be lots of soul-searching reviews to see whether there is anything they could have done to stop it. But the intelligence agencies have long warned that it is hard to prevent such lone-actor attacks.</p> \n  <p>Knowing that eventually someone would get through, Parker had a well-rehearsed plan in place and, as soon as word came through from the police that there had been an incident at Westminster, his teams began to swing into action and will be working through the night.</p> \n  <p>The security services, having established his identity, would have had to make sure that he was indeed working alone and not part of a network.

A disconnect between brain and feeling. So it took me the best part of an hour to make sense of what I had seen. But the simple truth is this. Today I saw a man die. A police officer, someone I had almost certainly said \u201chello\u201d to at some point over the years. Possibly even this morning \u2026</p> \n   <p> Armed police officers ran to the scene. Some started tending to the bodies; others stood around. Another man came running out. I didn\u2019t recognise him. None of us did, we must have all been in shock. It later turned out <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/mar/22/minister-tobias-ellwood-hailed-for-attempting-to-save-officers-life\">he was Tobias Ellwood</a>, a junior foreign minister whom we had all seen countless times before. <br></p> \n   <p>Time stretched out as people began to do CPR on both bodies.

He told the Guardian he feared another Paris attack was under way.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI was cycling from the West End up the Embankment and saw a black car on the pavement right next to Big Ben with the front all smashed in with a body next to it. I thought it was just an accident and carried on cycling past and noticed people running around and I thought \u2018what is going on\u2019. A few seconds later I heard shots coming from inside the parliament grounds. I then realised this was not just another accident.\u201d</p> \n  <p>He said the body next to the car \u201cwasn\u2019t moving and there was a lot of blood\u201d.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThere were students shouting because there was a lot of blood. It felt like about 10 seconds after [that I heard the shots] but it could have been a bit longer because by that point I was starting to get a bit scared. I think there were three or four shots but I couldn\u2019t swear to that.\u201d</p> \n  <p>He said the shots came from the yard in front of the Palace of Westminster.</p> \n  <p>\u201cAs I looked [through the railings] there were people milling around and I think a couple of bodies on the floor. I couldn\u2019t tell if they were injured or had just been asked to lay down. The police at that point started to appear and were moving everybody back.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI felt shock. At the point that I thought maybe this was a bigger thing I started to get scared, but it calmed down pretty quickly and then it was just, shit, what is going on.\u201d </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-03-22T16:24:29.772Z\">at 4.24pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-58d2a245e4b01ea2330bafc9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/vikramdodd\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-22T16:12:53.175Z\">4.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>There is no official estimate of the number injured in the incidents today in Westminster, but police fear they may run into double digits.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-03-22T16:14:42.147Z\">at 4.14pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-58d2a1e9e4b01ea2330bafc5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-22T16:11:27.779Z\">4.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>An eyewitness has told Sky News that he saw a body in the Thames after the car drove into people on Westminster Bridge.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-58d2a0dae4b0a411e9ab760c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-22T16:07:10.002Z\">4.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The London Eye has stopped and is currently holding all its \u201cguests\u201d within the attraction. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheLondonEye/status/844577091060412416\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">1/5 There is an ongoing incident on Westminster Bridge and in the vicinity of the Palace of Westminster</p>\u2014 The London Eye (@TheLondonEye) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheLondonEye/status/844577091060412416\">March 22, 2017</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheLondonEye/status/844577172501286914\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">2/5 This is an ongoing incident and, as yet, we cannot provide any firm details as to what has transpired</p>\u2014 The London Eye (@TheLondonEye) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheLondonEye/status/844577172501286914\">March 22, 2017</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheLondonEye/status/844577241380147202\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">3/5 At present we are holding all of our guests within our attractions as per tried and tested security procedures.</p>\u2014 The London Eye (@TheLondonEye) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheLondonEye/status/844577241380147202\">March 22, 2017</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheLondonEye/status/844577291208396800\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">4/5 The safety and security of our guests and staff will always be our number one priority.</p>\u2014 The London Eye (@TheLondonEye) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheLondonEye/status/844577291208396800\">March 22, 2017</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheLondonEye/status/844577339149299712\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">5/5 We will update as frequently as possible.</p>\u2014 The London Eye (@TheLondonEye) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheLondonEye/status/844577339149299712\">March 22, 2017</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>This Spanish tourist says he has been held for more than 20 minutes and has posted an image on Twitter.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/hhersio/status/844574901847646210\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"es\" dir=\"ltr\">20 minutos despu\u00e9s sigo aqu\u00ed subido en el London Eye, vaya movida macho. <a href=\"https://t.co/7nu38OYulr\">pic.twitter.com/7nu38OYulr</a></p>\u2014 Hersio (@hhersio) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hhersio/status/844574901847646210\">March 22, 2017</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-58d29f45e4b0a411e9ab7601\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-22T15:59:49.339Z\">3.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Scottish parliament has now suspended its sitting.

He put the figures about cuts well, and, for the first time in ages, resorted to the \u2018here\u2019s a question from a voter\u2019 tactic (once his hallmark), which today worked effectively. May was bland and unconvincing on the general funding point, although she was right to say that the school funding formula was an issue that governments have dodged for too long. She seemed much more animated defending grammars, the domestic policy initiative to which she seems most personally committed, but Corbyn held his ground well, helped by being able to quote Tories opposed to this. You could tell May was under pressure because resorted to the personal, attacking Corbyn for a decision about this son\u2019s education (which reportedly helped to break up his second marriage - he did not support his wife\u2019s desire to send their son to a grammar), but if you are going to go personal, you probably have to be ruthless to make it decisive, and May did not press her point, with the result that Corbyn was not thrown off his stride. So it was an effective performance by him, if not a decisive win.</p> \n  <p>Robertson focused on two well-rehearsed SNP complaints: May\u2019s failure to reach an agreement with Scotland on Brexit, and her refusal to commit to offering Scotland an independence referendum. Both are relatively easy hits, although, in her second answer, May was able to come back with a particularly well-honed soundbite about how she is honouring the results of the UK\u2019s last two referendums, while the SNP is doing neither.</p> \n  <p><em>(Regular readers will notice that the snap verdict now includes Angus Robertson.

She wants the best possible deal for the people of Scotland. At heart we are one people.</p> \n  <p>Robertson says May has admitted that she has reached no agreement. She wants the people to know the outcome of the Brexit deal before Scotland votes on independence. If the Commons, the Lords, the European parliament and EU parliaments can get a choice on Scotland\u2019s future after the deal is concluded, why shouldn\u2019t the Scottish people get a choice too?</p> \n  <p>May says the people of Scotland voted to stay in the UK.

There are more teachers with first class degrees. It is not a vanity project to want better schools. There is a difference between her and Corbyn.

She wants people to get on on the basis of merit, not privilege. That is what she is delivering. Labour has opposed every policy that has improved education.</p> \n  <p>Corbyn says May should speak to the Tory MP Geoffrey Clifton-Brown who said all his schools would have a cut under this budget. But May found \u00a3320m for divisive grammar schools. What kind of priority is that?</p> \n  <p>May says the new funding formula addresses a problem Labour ignored. MPs have been saying this for years. She said it 15 years ago when she was shadow education secretary. The government has proposed a new approach. She says the government has put money into offering diversity. She says Diane Abbott and Shami Chakrabarti sent their children to private schools. Corbyn sent his son to a grammar.

The schools budget has been protected. The national funding formula is a consultation.</p> \n  <p>Corbyn says the Tory manifesto said the amount of money following your child into school will be protected. No wonder even the Evening Standard editor is concerned.

He organised <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2017/mar/21/death-martin-mcguinness-reaction-politics-live?page=with:block-58d10435e4b0a411e9ab6f2b#block-58d10435e4b0a411e9ab6f2b\">the letter signed by 76 mostly pro-leave MP complaining about the BBC giving too much prominence to reports conveying a negative impression of Brexit. </a>Thankfully the duty Today editor isn\u2019t taking much notice because this morning the programme gave a prominent slot to <strong>Lord Whitty</strong>, chair of the Lords EU internal market sub-committee, which has today published <a href=\"https://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201617/ldselect/ldeucom/135/13502.htm\">a report saying the businesses in the service sector would face \u201csignificant damage\u201d if the UK left the EU without a trade deal. </a>The government wants a trade deal but, as the Guardian reports, s<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/mar/21/pro-brexit-ministers-relaxed-about-leaving-eu-without-trade-deal\">ome cabinet ministers are saying they are relaxed about crashing out of the EU without a trade deal and instead having to rely on World Trade Organisations terms to trade with the EU.</a></p> \n  <p>This is what Whitty said in a statement explaining why this is so important.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The UK is the second largest exporter of services in the world and the EU receives 39% of the UK\u2019s non-financial service exports. This trade is critical to the UK\u2019s economy as it creates employment and supports goods exports - we can\u2019t afford to lose that. </p> \n   <p>To protect the UK\u2019s status as a global leader of trade in services, the government will need to secure the most comprehensive FTA that has ever been agreed with the EU. Walking away from negotiations without a deal would badly damage UK plc, particularly in sectors such as aviation and broadcasting which have no WTO rules to fall back on.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And here\u2019s an extract from the report explaining this case in more detail.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Trade in services is inherently different from, and in many ways more complex than, trade in goods. Services are intangible and can be traded either online, in person, via a subsidiary business located in another territory or (increasingly) embedded within manufactured goods ...</p> \n   <p>Unlike trade in goods, trade in services is largely unaffected by tariffs, but instead can be restricted by non-tariff barriers. Such barriers may not only increase the cost of trade but can also prohibit trade altogether. For example, without the right qualifications or licence, some UK service providers may not be able to deliver a service abroad ...</p> \n   <p>A \u2018no deal\u2019 scenario, or a deal which gave no special consideration to UK trade in non-financial services, would risk significant damage to these sectors. For instance, WTO rules do not provide for trade with the EU in aviation or broadcasting services at all. Instead, UK firms would have to rely on outdated and restrictive agreements. While the UK\u2019s global standing in services may mitigate some negative consequences, faced with a \u2018no deal\u2019 scenario, businesses could be forced either to re-structure or relocate in order to continue to operate in the way that they do today. Moreover, WTO rules would also not sufficiently facilitate the cross-border movement of persons that supports the UK\u2019s trade in services with the EU, nor would they ensure the free flow of data. Rules on market access also differ between EU member states\u2014increasing the regulatory complexity for UK firms.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>We are likely to hear more about this this afternoon, when David Davis, the Brexit secretary, gives evidence to the Lords EU committee.</p> \n  <p>Here is the agenda for the day.<br></p> \n  <p><em>10am: </em>Nick Hurd, the business minister, gives a speech on industrial strategy to the Localis thinktank.</p> \n  <p><em>10.30am: </em>Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd, the lord chief justice, gives evidence to the Lords constitution committee.</p> \n  <p><em>12pm:</em> Theresa May faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs.</p> \n  <p><em>12.30pm:</em> Tim Farron, the Lib Dem leader, proposes a 10-minute rule bill calling for a referendum on the final Brexit deal.</p> \n  <p><em>Around 2.30pm: </em>MSPs resume their debate on the SNP\u2019s call for a second independence referendum.

The police officer has been named as PC Keith Palmer, 48, a member of the parliamentary and diplomatic protection command, with 15 years\u2019 service in the force. He was unarmed. Metropolitan police acting deputy commissioner Mark Rowleysaid Palmer was a husband and father: He was someone who left for work today expecting to return home at the end of his shift and he had every right to expect that would happen. The other victims of the attack, and the assailant, have not yet been named. Police said 40 other people were injured; many remain in hospital, some in a serious condition. Five South Korean tourists, four students from Ormskirk\u2019s Edge Hill University, and a German woman resident in Australia have been identified as among the wounded. Investigators say they believe they know the identity of the attacker, and that he is thought to have acted alone but was \u201cinspired by international terrorism\u201d. The House of Commons will sit this morning, with prime ministerTheresa May saying the country would not be cowed: Parliament will meet as normal. We will come together as normal. And Londoners \u2013 and others from around the world who have come here to visit this great city \u2013 will get up and go about their day as normal. They will board their trains, they will leave their hotels, they will walk these streets, they will live their lives. And we will all move forward together. Never giving in to terror. And never allowing the voices of hate and evil to drive us apart. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, echoed her comments, saying: London is the greatest city in the world and we stand together in the face of those who seek to harm us and destroy our way of life. UK foreign minister Boris Johnson, who is in the US for an international meeting discussing the Isis threat, said: Heartbreaking. This is not the first attack on London or our Parliament - and won\u2019t be the last - but our values will prevail. The terror threat level for the UK remains unchanged, at \u201csevere\u201d. The Metropolitan police said extra patrols, armed and unarmed, would be in place, \u201cparticularly in crowded places and iconic locations\u201d. The Queen has postponed a planned visit to Scotland Yard that was due to take place today. Roads around Parliament Square remain closed, as does Westminster Bridge, as police investigations continue. Overnight, a police raid took place in the southwest of Birmingham. It is not clear if it is connected to the attack in London. Shinzo Abe, the Japanese prime minister, has offered his condolences: A terrorist attack has occurred in the United Kingdom. I offer my deepest condolences to the victims and extend my sympathy to all those who were wounded. Terrorism is absolutely intolerable. Japan stands in solidarity with Prime Minister May of the United Kingdom, as well as with its people during this difficult time. Prime Minister May has conveyed the message that the United Kingdom is firm in the fight against terrorism. Japan offers its full support to Prime Minister May and will combat terrorism in cooperation with the international community. El Pa\u00eds: Terrorism forces world\u2019s first parliament to close Gulf News: Car rampage, knife attack jolt London De Morgen: Terror is back in London Wall Street Journal: London rampage leaves 4 dead The attack outside the Houses of Parliament in London is the latest in a series of terrorist atrocities involving a vehicle being driven at speed into pedestrians \u2013 a tactic actively promoted by Islamic State. In December, a man whose asylum claim had been rejected by Germany drove a truck into a market in Berlin, killing 12. Last July a stolen truck driven through a Bastille Day parade in Nice killed 86. The strikes appear inspired, if not actively commissioned, by Isis in Iraq and Syria. In November a student used a vehicle and knives to injure 13 on a campus in Ohio, in the US. His motives and allegiance are less clear. Such attacks are not unprecedented, but have become much more numerous in recent years. In 2014 the chief spokesman of the group, Mohammed al-Adnani, issued a call for sympathisers in the west to strike \u201cunbelievers\u201d, especially police officers or soldiers, where they were \u2013 rather than travel to the middle east to fight there. \u201cIf you are not able to find a bomb or a bullet, then smash his head with a rock, or slaughter him with a knife, or run him over with your car, or throw him down from a high place, or choke him, or poison him,\u201d he said. Though al-Adnani, who was killed in 2016, pointed a finger specifically at France, where there were two vehicle attacks in 2014, he also cited the UK among preferred targets. \u2022 This section of the live blog was amended on 23 March 2017 to clarify a reference to the Berlin truck attacker. The brother of a British aid worker murdered by Isis in Syria has appealed for calm in the wake of the Westminster attack, Press Association reports: David Haines was beheaded in Syria three years ago by the group after being held prisoner for 18 months. His elder brother Mike, who works with groups to combat extremist indoctrination of young people in the UK, said it was \u201cvital\u201d that communities \u201cremain calm and united\u201d, regardless of the motive. Mike Haines said: \u201cMy thoughts and prayers go out to the family and friends of the victims of this tragic attack in the heart of our nation\u2019s capital. \u201cIn the midst of the hurt and heartache that we are all feeling in this moment, it is vital that we as a society remain calm and united, no matter who or what was behind this attack. \u201cTerrorism, in all its guises, seeks to spread fear and divide us. In confronting this evil, we must stand shoulder to shoulder, with confidence that we are all stronger when we stand together. \u201cThe reports of kindness and solidarity amongst those on the scene, proves our togetherness. \u201cWhatever the motivations, they will not succeed in sewing distrust amongst us \u2013 I have seen first hand that we are stronger than that.\u201d It\u2019s still early in London but pre-dawn travellers are still being advised to avoid the Westminster area: BBC Newsnight reported late on Wednesday evening that the car used in the attack could have been rented in Birmingham. The Guardian has not been able to verify this report. West Midlands police \u2013 according to a statement cited by the Telegraph, the Daily Mail and others \u2013 has said of the raid that saw a road in southwest Birmingham closed for around two hours overnight: There is an ongoing police operation, no further details are being given at this stage. WMP referred media enquiries to the Metropolitan police in London, which said it would not be commenting for \u201coperational reasons\u201d. Londoners have expressed defiance after the terrorist attack at Westminster, sharing messages of solidarity on social media. #WeAreNotAfraid was trending in London as users reacted to the deaths of five people, including the attacker, on Wednesday and expressed gratitude and support for the work of emergency services. Comedian and actor Margaret Cabourn-Smith characterised this tenor of the response, tweeting: \u201c#WeAreNotAfraid Or rather I am; but I\u2019m damned if I\u2019m going to let that stop me doing anything differently. \u201cI\u2019m a bladdy Londoner.\u201d A police raid has taken place in the early hours of Thursday morning in Birmingham, where Hagley Road in the southwest of the city was cordoned off for a while. At this point it is not clear whether this is in any way related to the attack in London. I\u2019ll have more details here if they emerge. The lights of the landmark in Paris were turned off at midnight as a mark of respect for the victims of Wednesday\u2019s terror attack in Westminster. ABC\u2019s Leigh Sales reports that the Australian permanent resident caught up in the Westminster attack is being treated for injuries sustained when the attacker\u2019s car ran over her foot. She is originally from Germany but now lives in South Australia. Malcolm Turnbull and Australian Labor leader Bill Shorten are offering condolences to the UK in the Canberra parliament now, with the British High Commissioner Menna Rawlings looking on. Turnbull said: As prime minister Theresa May said earlier this morning, the values of the British parliament command the admiration and respect of free people everywhere. And so they do because they are our values too. We stand, all of us, with the UK. Comforted that we share those values. They\u2019re ours. Freedom of speech, democracy, the rule of law. We will never give in to terror. He said of British MP Tobias Ellwood, who assisted attempts to resuscitate the police officer, PC Keith Palmer, who was fatally stabbed: This act of heroism is just one of the extraordinary stories that are emerging from this tragedy. Shorten paid tribute to Palmer: The murder of the Metropolitan police officer reminds us of the risks our security agencies take on our behalf to keep us safe. And on behalf of all honourable members I want to acknowledge and thank our Australian federal police and the parliamentary security officers for whom this news must strike a particular chord. (Thanks to my colleague Gabrielle Chan on the Australian politics live blog for the quotes.) Australia\u2019s attorney general, George Brandis, has said \u201can Australian permanent resident\u201d was injured in the attack in Westminster and is in hospital. Consular staff in London are offering the woman assistance, he said. He added: We stand in solidarity with the people of the United Kingdom. Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull says the injured person lives in South Australia. Thursday\u2019s Guardian editorial calls for solidarity in the wake of the terror attack on Westminster and pays tribute to the officers who intervened: The security forces and police have planned for what they call a \u201cmarauding attack\u201d for years. The awful choreography of the response to terror was fast and well-rehearsed. The police officer who later died of his injuries stopped the attacker at the gates off Parliament Square. Before the man had gone a pace or two further, he himself was shot by an armed officer. These two courageous interventions almost certainly saved scores of lives in a busy area thronged with politicians, visitors and some of the hundreds of staff who work in the palace. There will be many questions to ask in the coming days about what was known of the attacker and his associates, but for now, there can only be a wholehearted appreciation of the professionalism with which the police did their job. Donald Trump Jr is facing a backlash for criticising London mayor Sadiq Khan with a scornful tweet sent hours after an attack at the Houses of Parliament left five dead, including a police officer and the attacker. The US president\u2019s eldest son tweeted a link to a September 2016 story in the Independent, which quoted Khan saying terror attacks were \u201cpart and parcel of living in a big city \u2026 I want to be reassured that every single agency and individual involved in protecting our city has the resources and expertise they need to respond in the event that London is attacked.\u201d \u201cYou have to be kidding me?!\u201d Trump Jr tweeted, quoting only the headline: \u201cTerror attacks are part of living in big city, says London Mayor Sadiq Khan\u201d. It\u2019s unclear if the president\u2019s son read the article or understood that the quote was from six months ago and not a response to the Wednesday attack, which police are treating as a terrorist incident. The Hyundai driven by the attacker raced over Westminster Bridge, mounting the pavement and mowing down pedestrians. Three members of the public are now believed to have been killed here, and up to 40 injured. The car then veered across a cycle lane and smashed into parliament\u2019s perimeter wall. A man jumped out of the car and rushed through the gates into New Palace Yard where he fatally stabbed PC Keith Palmer. The attacker was then shot several times by armed officers. What happened in Westminster was witnessed by a number of parliamentary journalists, whose offices immediately overlook New Palace Yard, the cobbled square through which many MPs and peers drive each day to access parliament\u2019s underground carpark: Quentin Letts, the Daily Mail\u2019s parliamentary sketchwriter, has a desk near the window overlooking the yard; on hearing a loud crash and some screams, he told BBC news, he and his colleagues rushed to see what was happening. \u201cThen I saw a thick-set man dressed in black clothes, he looked I would say about 40 years old, I don\u2019t think he had much hair, running \u2026 through the gates. He seemed to have something in his hand, a stick or something like that.\u201d A policeman who tried to challenge the man had fallen over, Letts said, \u201cand the attacker was hitting him, possibly striking him or knifing him\u201d. The weapon was a knife, and the stab wounds inflicted would prove fatal. The victim was later named as PC Keith Palmer, a 48-year-old officer with 15 years\u2019 service who was a husband and father. The attacker then ran towards the entrance of the parliament building that is used by MPs each day. \u201cHe got about 15 yards or so when he was shot by two plain-clothes men who had come out of the building, having been summoned by the uniformed police,\u201d said Letts. Before shooting, they shouted something at the man, \u201cand he appeared to ignore them and still ran towards them, and they shot him about three times\u201d. The Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has extended Australia\u2019s \u201cheartfelt sympathy and resolute solidarity\u201d to the people of the UK. The attack in the British parliament is an attack on parliaments, freedom and democracy everywhere. Westminster is rightly known as the mother of parliaments. Almost every element of our parliamentary tradition, here in Australia, is modelled on that of the houses of parliament in London. We send our condolences, especially to the families of the victims, those injured, including a police officer murdered by the terrorist. Turnbull said he had received briefings on the attack from Australia\u2019s counter-terrorism coordinator, Tony Sheehan, and the high commissioner in London, Alexander Downer. He had also spoken to the Australian federal police commissioner and the director general of security, Duncan Lewis. Turnbull added that there would be an increased police presence in Canberra\u2019s Parliament House on Thursday. Australians should be reassured that our agencies are today, as every day, working relentlessly to keep Australians safe. We are very alert to the vulnerabilities of places of mass gathering and the risk of lone attackers, like the terrorist in London. Keeping Australians safe is our highest priority. It is the first duty of my government. See more in our Australian politics live blog: The South Korean embassy in London has sent officials to two London hospitals where five South Korean victims are being treated, media in Seoul have reported. All of the injured South Koreans are believed to be aged in their 50s or 60s. A South Korean foreign ministry official said the embassy had entered emergency mode since the terrorist attack, according to KBS World Radio. The report added that South Korean nationals travelling in the UK had been sent text messages alerting them about possible risks. \u201cThree of the four women and a man sustained relatively light injuries but the other woman sustained an injury to her head and underwent surgery at a nearby hospital,\u201d KBS World Radio reported, saying the tourists were hurt when they were caught in a stampede of people fleeing the attack on Westminster Bridge. The Seoul Shinmun, a daily broadsheet, reported that the 67-year-old female victim, who has been identified only as Park, was not directly injured by the vehicle driven deliberately by the attacker into pedestrians on the bridge, but fell to the floor. She is undergoing surgery at St Mary\u2019s hospital, Paddington. Park arrived in London a day earlier together with her husband and was scheduled to leave for Paris later on Wednesday, Yonhap news agency reported, citing officials. Of the four other South Koreans injured in the incident, two required surgery due to a clavicle fracture or arm fracture, and the remaining two patients complained of pain, according to the Seoul Shinmum. Donald Trump has tweeted for the first time about the attack on London (a tweet was earlier sent from the @Potus account, which is run by White House staff). Police officers across the UK have expressed sorrow at the death of PC Keith Palmer, Press Association reports: Greater Manchester Police chief constable Ian Hopkins said: \u201cRIP PC Keith Palmer, brutally murdered today carrying out his duty helping to protect parliament and the freedom of our country.\u201d The Metropolitan Police Federation, which represents officers from the force, said: \u201cPC Keith Palmer. Our brave Met police colleague who today made the ultimate sacrifice.\u201d Edge Hill University, in Ormskirk, Lancashire, has confirmed that some of its students were injured on Westminster Bridge. In a statement, the university said the group \u2013 believed to have been 13 students and their lecturer \u2013 had been visiting the capital on a field trip. Two students were taken to hospital. Owen Lambert, 18, from Morecambe, Lancashire, needed stitches to a head wound, and Travis Frain from Darwen, who, according to a tweet from a local journalist, had a cracked rib plus hand and arm injuries. His mother, Angela Frain, confirmed he was in hospital: I have spoken to him at 3.20pm and I know he\u2019s OK. He\u2019s at the hospital with a police officer. The police officer just said he was in good spirits. Two other students are believed to have minor injuries but were not hospitalised. All others on the trip were safe and accounted for, the university said. Dr John Cater, vice-chancellor of Edge Hill, told BBC North West Tonight: They had just actually finished their session, were leaving the parliament building and in the Westminster Bridge area where we understand \u2026 they were involved in the incident. We understand that two students have been taken to hospital but as walking wounded \u2013 one with a head wound and one with a wrist injury. There are two other students who have minor injuries who are with police and acting as witnesses. The good news is that the other nine students are now back in a hostel receiving support and will return to the north-west tomorrow. The details are invariably hazy \u2026 Our assumption is that they were either knocked over by other people or struck by the vehicle. Obviously all of them will be somewhat traumatised by what they have seen as well. The students are due to return to Ormskirk on Thursday. Five people are now confirmed to have died in the attack on Westminster on Wednesday: one police officer, three members of the public, and the attacker. The police officer has been named as PC Keith Palmer, 48, a member of the parliamentary and diplomatic protection command, with 15 years\u2019 service in the force. He was a husband and father. The other victims of the attack, and the assailant, have not yet been identified. Police said 40 other people were injured; many remain in hospital tonight, some in a serious condition. Investigators say they believe they know the identity of the attacker, and that he is thought to have acted alone but was \u201cinspired by international terrorism\u201d. Parliament will resume on Friday morning. The intelligence agencies have been warning of such an attack almost since the London bombings in July 2005. As late as last November, the head of Britain\u2019s domestic security agency, MI5, Andrew Parker, said unequivocally in an interview: \u201cThere will be terrorist attacks in this country.\u201d Even though they had known it would happen one day, there was soul-searching at MI5 headquarters, Thames House, just a 10-minute walk from the events at Westminster. They know they cannot stop every attack but there is still a sense of devastation when it happens. There will be lots of soul-searching reviews to see whether there is anything they could have done to stop it. But the intelligence agencies have long warned that it is hard to prevent such lone-actor attacks. Knowing that eventually someone would get through, Parker had a well-rehearsed plan in place and, as soon as word came through from the police that there had been an incident at Westminster, his teams began to swing into action and will be working through the night. The security services, having established his identity, would have had to make sure that he was indeed working alone and not part of a network. The working assessment is that his actions were Islamic State-inspired. Police have not yet identified the attacker, who died after being shot by an armed police officer within the Westminster security cordon. The Guardian understands the initial working theories of the investigation are that the attacker was inspired by Isis and was most likely a \u201clone actor\u201d. Police have said they believe they know who he is and described him as \u201cinspired by international terrorism\u201d. The front pages of Thursday\u2019s papers have been published, with some focused on MP Tobias Ellwood\u2019s unsuccessful fight to save the life of PC Keith Palmer, the unarmed police officer who rushed to confront the knife-wielding man; and others picturing the attacker himself. The Guardian The i The Times The Times chose to feature attempts to resuscitate both the police officer and his attacker: The Sun The Sun pictured the attacker and the police officer, across a wrap-around front (we are not including here the back page, which shows the body of the dead officer): The Daily Telegraph The Telegraph and others focused on the as-yet unnamed attacker, pictured as paramedics fought to keep him alive: The Daily Mail The Mirror The Daily Express Yonhap news agency in Seoul reports that five South Korean tourists were injured in the attack on Westminster Bridge. It cites a tour agency official saying four \u201csustained light injuries, and another serious injury \u2026 They are now being treated at two hospitals.\u201d Yonhap says the seriously injured tourist has been identified as \u201ca 67-year-old woman surnamed Park\u201d. It says she is being treated at St Mary\u2019s hospital, in Paddington, for a head injury sustained when she fell in the scramble to leave the bridge. My colleague John Crace, the Guardian\u2019s parliamentary sketchwriter, who works from our Westminster office, witnessed the death of PC Keith Palmer this afternoon. He writes here of the shock of the attack: The mind goes numb at times like these. A disconnect between brain and feeling. So it took me the best part of an hour to make sense of what I had seen. But the simple truth is this. Today I saw a man die. A police officer, someone I had almost certainly said \u201chello\u201d to at some point over the years. Possibly even this morning \u2026 Armed police officers ran to the scene. Some started tending to the bodies; others stood around. Another man came running out. I didn\u2019t recognise him. None of us did, we must have all been in shock. It later turned out he was Tobias Ellwood, a junior foreign minister whom we had all seen countless times before. Time stretched out as people began to do CPR on both bodies. Then after what felt like an age later, but can only have been a matter of minutes, there was the noise overhead of the air ambulance preparing to land in Parliament Square. Several armed police officers ran from New Palace Yard to talk to three paramedics dressed in yellow. They bypassed the first body \u2013 the assailant \u2013 and went straight to work on the fallen policeman. The scene became more ordered, yet more urgent. They worked for several minutes, hoping for a miracle that never came. \u201cLondon is the greatest city in the world and we stand together in the face of those who seek to harm us and destroy our way of life,\u201d the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said earlier. \u201cLondoners will never be cowed by terrorism.\u201d The lockdown of Westminster is over, police have confirmed. Mark Rowley, acting deputy commissioner of the Met, said hundreds of officers would continue through the night in their work on the investigation into the attack: We are forensically examining a complicated crime scene that covers a wide area, and as with all investigations of this nature it will take us some time to work through the painstaking work necessary to get all of the relevant evidence. But parliament will reopen on Friday, with business in the chambers expected to resume. Several MPs have already stated their intention to return to Westminster in the morning. Police have said some entrances to the parliamentary estate will be closed as they are part of the crime scene. The terror threat level would stay the same \u2013 \u201csevere\u201d \u2013 Rowley confirmed, adding: On a precautionary basis across the country we are stepping up police patrols \u2013 unarmed and armed \u2013 and the public will see far more of their local police forces over the forthcoming days, particularly in crowded places and iconic locations. The Metropolitan police has confirmed that PC Keith Palmer was unarmed. Acting deputy commissioner Mark Rowley explained: Our parliamentary protection team are a combination of armed and unarmed officers doing different roles, and sadly the officer who lost his life today was unarmed. He was supported by armed colleagues who shot and killed the attacker. [The attacker] tried to enter parliament and was stopped at the gate. Around the world, and as we have seen with other terror attacks in recent years, expressions of solidarity with London, and the UK, have been made. Tel Aviv, Israel Paris, France The lights went out on the Eiffel Tower at midnight: Birmingham, UK The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has sent his condolences to the family of PC Keith Palmer. In a statement issued on Facebook, Khan said: Tonight we have learned that the courageous police officer who was killed while protecting our city was PC Keith Palmer. He was 48 and a husband and father. Keith Palmer was killed while bravely doing his duty \u2013 protecting our city and the heart of our democracy from those who want to destroy our way of life. My heart goes out to his family, friends and colleagues. He personifies the brave men and women of our police and emergency services who work around the clock to keep us safe \u2013 tonight all Londoners are grateful to them. MPs and members of the House of Lords have been paying tribute to Keith Palmer, the officer who died today, as well as his colleagues who guard the parliamentary estate: James Cleverly, MP for Braintree, says he knew PC Keith Palmer, the officer killed today, for 25 years. He paid tribute to him on Twitter this evening: Speaking a short while ago, Met police acting deputy commissioner Mark Rowley said PC Keith Palmer, who was a member of the parliamentary and diplomatic protection command, had given 15 years\u2019 service: He was someone who left for work today expecting to return home at the end of his shift and he had every right to expect that would happen. Rowley confirmed that, besides Palmer, three members of the public were killed: Also, at this stage, but it may change - we believe approximately 40 people were injured, some with serious injuries, including three police officers, two of whom are in a serious condition. He added: Terrorists have a clear aim and that is to create discord, distrust and to create fear. The police stand with all communities in the UK and will take action against anyone who seeks to undermine society, especially where their crimes are motivated by hate. We must recognise now that our Muslim communities will feel anxious at this time given the past behaviour of the extreme right wing and we will continue to work with all community leaders in the coming days. It\u2019s essential for us to remain vigilant but to also work together \u2013 policing and communities \u2013 and unite against those who seek, through violence and extremism, to threaten, intimidate and cause fear. We ask the public to be alert and to report any suspicious activity to the police by calling 0800 789 321, or dialling 999. Whilst today is an incredibly sad and sombre day, especially for the MPS and everyone affected, it is only right that I mention the pride I feel in the swift and brave response from our officers \u2013 especially those who without fear for their own safety had to confront the terrorist. UK foreign minister Boris Johnson, who is in the US for an international meeting discussing the Isis threat, has tweeted about the attack in London: This is Claire Phipps picking up the live blog. Police have issued a picture of PC Keith Palmer, the 48-year-old police officer killed at Westminster today. He was a member of the parliamentary and diplomatic protection command and had 15 years\u2019 service in the force. He was a husband and father. He said the police believed they knew the identity of the attacker and were working to identify any associates, though he declined to give any further details. He said the man was thought to be inspired by international Islamist-related terrorism. He added that he recognises Britain\u2019s Muslim communities \u201cwill feel vulnerable at this time, given the past actions of right-wing extremists\u201d. The Met police have now confirmed that five people, including the attacker, died in the attack today. At least 40 people have been injured. Assistant deputy commissioner Mark Rowley names the police officer who died as Keith Palmer, a 48-year-old husband and father. My colleague Heather Stewart has some more information: Downing Street sources said May spent the afternoon being briefed on the unfolding attack, and chairing a meeting of Cobra, Whitehall\u2019s emergency committee. Home Office minister Ben Wallace stood in for Amber Rudd, who gave a televised statement on the attack from Pakistan, before boarding a plane back to London. Alan Duncan represented the Foreign Office, with Boris Johnson absent on a trip to Washington. Others present included health secretary Jeremy Hunt, London Mayor Sadiq Khan, and security and police officers. Both May and Khan are expected to make further public statements on Thursday; but the House of Commons will sit as planned. \u201cThe idea is very much business as usual,\u201d the source said. The campaign group Cage has expressed sympathy for today\u2019s victims. It also called on the UK government to enact policies that will bring an end to the \u201cglobal cycles of violence\u201d. Dr Adnan Siddiqui, its director, said: We express our deepest sympathies to all those who have lost their lives in this incident and to those many injured. While we accept that the security services and the police play a crucial role in keeping the public safe, such attacks which require very little planning cannot be thwarted by ever more securitisation and policing of communities. Reactionary policies in the UK have a global ramification and it is important that the government leads with policies that seek to end the global cycles of violence rather than further them. Buckingham Palace has announced the Queen has postponed a planned visit to Scotland Yard tomorrow. World leaders have condemned the attack in Westminster. The US president, Donald Trump, offered his condolences during a call to the prime minister, Theresa May, the White House said. He also pledged the \u201cfull cooperation and support of the United States government in responding to the attack and bringing those responsible to justice\u201d. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, also condemned the attack: I was shocked and saddened to learn of the innocent people who were killed and injured as a result of this cowardly attack. Canada and the UK are the closest of friends and allies. Our friendship is based on shared values and history \u2013 indeed, Canada\u2019s parliament is a descendant of the chamber targeted this morning. Today\u2019s attack on the UK parliament is an attack on democracies around the world. The Canadian parliament withstood a similar attack not so long ago by those who sought to instil fear and divide Canadians against themselves. Instead, Canadians came together. I am confident the British people will do the same, and will emerge from their grief stronger and more united than ever before. On behalf of all Canadians, I offer our full support to prime minister May and to the people of the United Kingdom. We stand ready to offer all possible assistance to the British government, to do what we can to bring to justice those responsible for this heinous act. Canadians stand united with the British people in the fight against terrorism. We will continue to work together with the UK and all our allies to show the world that freedom and democracy will always triumph. The leader of the Democrats in the US House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, also released a statement: Today, our thoughts and prayers are with the victims, survivors, and people of the United Kingdom. The American people share in the outrage and horror at this brutal terrorist attack in London. The special relationship between the United Kingdom and the United States has been critical to securing peace around the world. Together, we will remain strong and smart as we confront terrorists and defeat the threats to our nations. The United Kingdom will always have a friend and partner in the American people. During this difficult hour, we stand with the British people.\u201d Some clarification from the Met police. Acting deputy commissioner Mark Rowley said earlier that the officer who was killed was armed. \u201cIt has now been confirmed that he was not armed,\u201d Scotland Yard says. I have just chaired a meeting of the government\u2019s emergency committee, Cobra, following the sick and depraved terrorist attack on the streets of our capital this afternoon. The full details of exactly what happened are still emerging. But, having been updated by police and security officials, I can confirm that this appalling incident began when a single attacker drove his vehicle into pedestrians walking across Westminster bridge, killing two people and injuring many more, including three police officers. This attacker, who was armed with a knife, then ran towards Parliament, where he was confronted by the police officers who keep us and our democratic institutions safe. Tragically, one officer was killed. The terrorist was also shot dead. The United Kingdom\u2019s threat level has been set at severe for some time and this will not change. Acting deputy commissioner Rowley will give a further operational update later this evening. Our thoughts and prayers go out to all who have been affected; to the victims themselves and their family and friends who waved their loved ones off, but will not now be welcoming them home. For those of us who were in Parliament at the time of this attack, these events provide a particular reminder of the exceptional bravery of our police and security services who risk their lives to keep us safe. Once again today, these exceptional men and women ran towards the danger even as they encouraged others to move the other way. On behalf of the whole country, I want to pay tribute to them and to all our emergency services for the work they have been doing to reassure the public and bring security back to the streets of our capital city. That they have lost one of their own in today\u2019s attack only makes their calmness and professionalism under pressure all the more remarkable. The location of this attack was no accident. The terrorists chose to strike at the heart of our capital city, where people of all nationalities, religions and cultures come together to celebrate the values of liberty, democracy and freedom of speech. These streets of Westminster \u2013 home to the world\u2019s oldest parliament \u2013 are engrained with a spirit of freedom that echoes in some of the furthest corners of the globe. And the values our parliament represents \u2013 democracy, freedom, human rights, the rule of law \u2013 command the admiration and respect of free people everywhere. That is why it is a target for those who reject those values. But let me make it clear today, as I have had cause to do before: any attempt to defeat those values through violence and terror is doomed to failure. Tomorrow morning, Parliament will meet as normal. We will come together as normal. And Londoners - and others from around the world who have come here to visit this great city - will get up and go about their day as normal. They will board their trains, they will leave their hotels, they will walk these streets, they will live their lives. And we will all move forward together. Never giving in to terror. And never allowing the voices of hate and evil to drive us apart. The statement is over and the prime minister does not take any questions May says it is no accident that the attacker chose parliament which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law. She said that was why it is a target for those who reject those values, adding that any attempt to defeat those values through violence and terror is doomed to fail. Parliament will be open as normal tomorrow. These streets of Westminster are ingrained with the spirit of freedom that echoes in some of the furthest corners of the globe. She praises the exceptional bravery of police and security services who ran towards the danger as they encouraged others to move away. And pays tribute to the officer died. Once again today these exemplary men and women ran towards the danger even as they encouraged others to move the other way... That they have lost one of their own in todays attack only makes the calm and or under pressure all the more remarkable. Prime minister Theresa May is speaking. She describes the attacks as \u201csick and depraved.\u201d Four people have died and at least twenty have been injured in what police are treating as a terrorist incident in Westminster. Police were called to an incident at Parliament square in central London at 14.40 (GMT). An attacker drove into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge, killing at least two and seriously injuring others. A badly-injured woman was rescued from the Thames. The attacker then crashed into the railing of the Houses of Parliament, before attacking a police officer inside the gate of the Houses of Parliament. The police officer died of his injuries. His assailant was shot and killed by police. MP Tobias Ellwood attempted to resuscitate the officer, but he died at the scene. A group of French students and students from the north West of England were among the injured. Five London hospitals treated casualties: hospital officials said 12 people were treated for serious injuries, eight more were treated for less serious injuries at the scene. Home Secretary Amber Rudd condemned the attack on \u201cour shared values\u201d, but said they would never be destroyed. Large areas of central London were shut off to the public, and workers in the Palace of Westminster, including MPs were placed in lockdown for several hours. Some further details on how the injured were treated today in London\u2019s hospitals. In total five London hospitals treated casualties. Staff from St Thomas\u2019s, yards from the attack on Westminster Bridge, rushed to help the injured there. But the most seriously hurt were taken to three of the capital\u2019s four regional trauma centres: King\u2019s College in Camberwell, St Mary\u2019s in Paddington and the Royal London in Whitechapel. The Chelsea and Westminster hospital also dealt with some of the injured. Four university students were injured as they were caught up in the attack on Westminster Bridge, the Press Association has reported. They were among a group of 13 students and a lecturer from Edge Hill University, in Ormskirk, who were on the first day of a two-day educational visit to the Houses of Parliament. The students had just left Parliament and made their way on to Westminster Bridge after they had watched Prime Minister\u2019s Questions and met with MPs. Among those injured were Owen Lambert, 18, from Morecambe, Lancs, who needed stitches to a head wound, and Travis Frain, from Darwen. Dr John Cater, Vice Chancellor of Edge Hill University, told BBC North West Tonight: \u201cThey had just actually finished their session, were leaving the Parliament building and in the Westminster Bridge area where we understand ... they were involved in the incident. \u201cWe understand that two students have been taken to hospital but as walking wounded - one with a head wound and one with a wrist injury. There are two other students who have minor injuries who are with police and acting as witnesses. \u201cThe good news is that the other nine students are now back in a hostel receiving support and will return to the North West tomorrow.\u201d He added: \u201cThe details are invariably hazy I guess.Our assumption is that they were either knocked over by other people or struck by the vehicle. Obviously all of them will be somewhat traumatised by what they have seen as well.\u201d Earlier, the university tweeted: \u201cAll students and lecturer in Westminster have been accounted for and are being supported by the university.\u201d Ken Marsh, Chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, has offered his sympathy to the family to the fallen officer and all those killed and injured. He said: We offer our deepest sympathy to the family of the officer who has died. Our thoughts are also with all those killed and injured. This incident sadly shows the dangers our colleagues face on a daily basis. They show incredible bravery protecting the public. The Metropolitan Police Federation will be supporting the officer\u2019s colleagues in any way we can. Jeremy Corbyn MP, Leader of the Labour Party, has issued a statement: Today\u2019s horrific attack in Westminster has shocked the whole country. All our thoughts are with the victims of this outrage, their loved ones, families and friends. Those victims include civilians and police officers, Londoners and visitors, subjected to a brutal and indiscriminate assault. Our thanks and gratitude go to the police and emergency services who responded so bravely, and to those \u2013 including the MP Tobias Ellwood \u2013 who went to the aid of the injured and dying. This was not only an attack on innocent people. It was also an attack on our democracy. But I know that Londoners and people across the country will stand together in defence of our values and diversity. Romania\u2019s foreign ministry says two Romanians were wounded in a deadly attack in London\u2019s Westminster, the Associated Press have reported. The ministry said the two had been taken to a hospital for treatment. There were no further details on the identity of the two or how seriously they were injured. The ministry said it had been informed by authorities in London. My colleague Haroon Siddique earlier talked to a man who was waiting outside St Thomas\u2019s A&amp;E trying to glean information about Two Romanian friends who he feared had been caught up in the attack. He said a Romanian couple he met on a trip to Thailand, were on the bridge when it occurred. He was supposed to meet them at the London Eye but called when they failed to show up. We can\u2019t confirm if it is the same people confirmed as injured by the Romanian foreign ministry. Andy Sparrow is among those making his way home from Westminster, after all those who had been on lockdown were allowed to leave. But stay with us here on the Guardian liveblog for news updates as we get them. We are still waiting for a fuller statement from the prime minister who is chairing a Cobra emergency meeting this evening. Pauline Cranmer, London Ambulance Service deputy director of operations, has given further details of the injured. She said: Our thoughts are with the friends and families of those affected by today\u2019s incident. We treated 12 patients for serious injuries, who were all taken to hospital. Eight further patients were treated for less serious injuries at the scene. We were called to the incident at 2.40pm today, with the first ambulance crew arriving within six minutes. We sent a number of resources to the scene including ambulance crews, London\u2019s Air Ambulance and specialist teams trained to respond to this type of incident. We have been working closely with other members of the emergency services at the scene, with our priority being to ensure patients received the medical help they needed as quickly as possible. We declared a major incident and our priority was to assess patients and ensure that they were treated and taken to hospital as soon as possible. I would like to thank our staff and the other emergency services who responded today. Commenting on today\u2019s attack in Westminster a spokesman for the Public and Commercial Services union, which represents Met police security staff in the Palace of Westminster and civil servants in nearby government buildings, said: Our thoughts are with the victims of this horrific attack and their families. We also send our solidarity to police and security staff in parliament and all those who work in and around Westminster, including MPs, their employees and civil servants. The lockdown of Westminster seems to be over, after several hours. Around 1,000 people were in Westminster Abbey, including parliament workers as well as MPs. They were interviewed by police to see if they had any information that could help the inquiry. All the people working on the parliamentary estate who were being held in Westminster Hall have also been allowed to leave. MPs who were held in other parts of the building have also been allowed out. London\u2019s mayor, Sadiq Khan, has issued this video statement, saying Londoners will never be cowed by terrorism. MPs have been released from inside the Chamber and I\u2019ve just spoken to Green MP Caroline Lucas who was locked in along with many other MPs. She told me: I was in the voting lobby and the doors slammed quite firmly and then we were told to stay inside. Everyone was mostly quiet, on their phones or iPads watching the news. A lot of people were thanking the chamber staff, security staff who we see every day who keep us safe. We were told the House will sit as normal and then it was asked if we\u2019ll be given a chance to pay tribute tomorrow and we were told that we would. And everyone filed out. These are from Brendan Cox, whose wife, Jo, the Labour MP, was murdered last year by a far-right terrorist. Travis Frain, a politics student at Edge Hill University, was one of those injured on Westminster Bridge, his family have confirmed. Travis\u2019s mother, Angela Frain, told the Guardian he was in \u201cgood spirits\u201d and was in hospital. He reportedly suffered a cracked rib and minor injuries to his hand and arm in the attack. Angela Frain, from Darwen in Lancashire, said: \u201cI have spoken to him at 3.20pm and I know he\u2019s OK. I\u2019m waiting to hear back; his phone\u2019s actually dead at the moment. He\u2019s at the hospital with a police officer and his phone\u2019s on charge so I haven\u2019t spoken to him properly. \u201cThe police officer just said he was in good spirits and he\u2019s waiting to be x-rayed. I think that\u2019s just for minor injuries. I haven\u2019t got any information at all [about his injuries]; when I spoke to him at 3.20pm it was just a quick call to say that he was OK. I\u2019m hoping to hear back from him in the next few hours but at this point that\u2019s the only information I have.\u201d Here is the full text of the statement about the attack from Mark Rowley, the Metropolitan police head of counter-terrorism and acting deputy commissioner. We covered the highlights earlier. (See 6.14pm.) This is from Gordon Brown, the former prime minister. These are from Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury. And he retweeted this. David Lidington, the leader of the Commons, has just told MPs in the chamber that they will be sitting tomorrow. This is from Rupa Huq MP. And these are from Channel 4 News\u2019 Michael Crick. The flag above Scotland Yard is being flown at half mast to honour the heroism of its fallen officer and other victims of today\u2019s attack. Foreign minister Tobias Ellwood attempted to resuscitate the police officer fatally attacked outside parliament and stemmed the blood from the multiple stab wounds. Ellwood, a former soldier, was pictured kneeling over the policeman\u2019s body as he gave mouth-to-mouth resuscitation in a bid to save the officer\u2019s life. Ellwood was surrounded by paramedics, police officers and doctors as he tried to treat the injuries, and remained with the victim until the air ambulance arrived. The officer was later confirmed dead. The minister was later pictured with bloodied hands and forehead being comforted by officers in New Palace Yard. Ellwood, a former captain in the Royal Green Jackets who served in Kuwait, has personal experience of terrorism after his brother Jonathan was killed in the 2002 Bali bombings. A source told the Telegraph: \u201c[Ellwood] tried to give mouth-to-mouth and stem blood flow from multiple stab wounds to the officer until the chopper and medics arrived.\u201d The police officer is among four who had been confirmed dead as part of the incident which is being treated as a terror attack, while at least twenty have been injured. Ellwood has been a Conservative MP for Bournemouth East since 2005 and was appointed parliamentary under-secretary at the Foreign Office in July 2014. More details have emerged about those injured in today\u2019s attack. King\u2019s College hospital have confirmed that the major trauma unit have treated eight victims, six males and two females. Two are in a critical condition and six are in a stable condition. A visitor to Parliament jumped to the aid of the stricken police officer moments after he was attacked. Tony Davis, a coach for the British Lionhearts, the British boxing team, tried to revive the officer moments after seeing him stabbed with two knives. Davis was identified from photographs by members of his team. They said he went to help the police officer moments after he was stabbed. One member of the team, who asked not to be named, said: The attacker has two knives and was stabbing the officer. Then, shots rang out and the attacker fell to the floor. Tony jumped over a fence and ran to the police officer and tried to revive him. The officer started to fit, but Tony was still working on him. There were lots of officers around, but they were trying to revive both men. Davis, who is a former serviceman, was leading the British Lionhearts boxing team at the House of Commons to attend a press conference. Davis was with the team on a publicity visit ahead of an international bout. \u201cTony hopped over the fence to assist straight away,\u201d said a member of the team. He was later seen being comforted by police officers as he wore a bloodied team T-shirt. Parliamentary staff have been emailed by security saying people in Millbank and Tothill Street can leave the buildings. But everyone in the Palace of Westminster must continue to stay put until further notice. Welfare support has been offered to anyone who needs it. Most MPs and staff stuck in the offices and corridors of Norman Shaw North are pretty calm though - most glued to television sets or huddled round mobile phones, and a few quietly getting on with their work. The UK Parliament has confirmed it will be open as usual tomorrow. Home Secretary Amber Rudd has called the attack on \u201cour shared values\u201d, but said they would never be destroyed. Rudd has been in Lahore in Pakistan, but is currently making her way back to London. She said: We do not yet know the full impact of this terrible incident. But I know that the whole country will be thinking and praying for those who are affected as I am. I want to thank the emergency services for the quick response and pay tribute to their bravery their courage and their professionalism. I\u2019ve been briefed by the Met Police and by the security services and the security minister has also been updated. This is an ongoing incident and the government will continue to be updated. The Prime Minister will chair Cobra today. The Government\u2019s top priority is the security of the people and I urge everyone to remain calm but to be vigilant and if they see anything they are concerned about they should report it to the police. We have the best police, the best security services in the world and we must make sure that we let them get on with doing their job. The British people will be united in working together to defeat those who would harm our shared values. Values of democracy, tolerance and the rule of law. Values symbolised by the Houses of Parliament. Values that will never be destroyed. Downing Street have just issued this statement. It\u2019s from a Number 10 spokesman. The thoughts of the PM and the government are with those killed and injured in this appalling incident, and with their families. The PM is being kept updated and will shortly chair COBR. The Ukip leader, Paul Nuttall, has issued this statement about the attack. A terrible attack on our democracy has taken place today. My thoughts tonight go out to the victims of this terrorist atrocity and their families. Once again the emergency services have demonstrated the extraordinary work they do on our behalf. That a police officer is among the dead underlines the debt of gratitude we all owe those who work to keep us safe. In the coming hours and days more information will doubtlesly emerge about the attacker or attackers and their motivation. In the meantime everyone should resolve that terrorism will never beat us. I\u2019m in Westminster Hall waiting to be evacuated and have just bumped into Julian Lewis, the Conservative MP who chairs parliament\u2019s defence committee. He told me: It is always open to any lunatic with a fanatical outlook on life to mount an attack against innocent people in pursuit of their fixations and we have to be ever grateful to those who defend us on the perimeter of this building which was attacked before by the IRA and which has been anticipating this possibility ever since 11 September 2001. We were recalled to parliament for an emergency session on Friday 14 September, and that was the first time we had he presence of police armed with sub machine guns openly guarding the Palace of Westminster - and they\u2019ve been here ever since. Five of the injured and have been taken to the major trauma centre at Kings College Hospital London, according to the BBC. Steve White, chair of the Police Federation of England and Wales, which represents tens of thousands of rank-and-file officers, has paid tribute to the officers involved in the incident. He said: No words can capture how members of the policing family will feel after today\u2019s horrific events. We have lived in the knowledge that an attack on UK soil has been highly likely for nearly three years. Everyone is firmly aware of this fact, but it makes it no less shocking when it becomes a reality. This incident highlights the very real risks that police face each and every day. Officers will tonight take the opportunity to hug loved ones and seek comfort in the company of friends and family. But one will not. The pain of that officer\u2019s family, friends and colleagues will be shared by us all. Our hearts go out to their family and our thoughts are with them and their colleagues at this terrible time along with others who have been injured today. Here is some more international reaction to the attack. From Donald Tusk, president of the European council: From Angela Merkel, the German chancellor: Speaking in Berlin Merkel said: Even if the background to these attacks has yet to be cleared up, I would like to emphasise on behalf of Germany and its citizens: we stand resolutely on Britain\u2019s side in the fight against any form of terrorism. Berlin mayor, Michael M\u00fcller, expressed his solidarity with the citizens of London while speaking at a campaign event with SPD candidate Martin Schulz, saying he had been due to meet the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, next week. \u201cEspecially in times like these, it is important that friends stand together,\u201d M\u00fcller said. From the French president, Francois Hollande: From the French embassy: From Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen, the Danish prime minister: More details are emerging about the French students injured on Westminster Bridge during the attack. Ouest France reported that three students from the Saint-Joseph de Concarneau lyc\u00e9e (secondary school) were injured in the car attack. The paper said two of them were in a critical condition. The condition of the third is not known. The pupils were in 2nd grade - aged 15 or 16. There were four classes from the school on a week-long visit to London, meaning more than 100 teenagers. Around a dozen were believed to have been on Westminster Bridge at the time of the attack. Forough Salami, vice-president of the Brittany regional council, was in London with two colleagues Anne Gallo and Mona Bras. She was with a delegation of 40 people from business and cultural circles invited to the Australian embassy. \u201cAt the time of the attack, we weren\u2019t nearby and we had difficulty having information, but we\u2019ve just learned what hospital the three injured lyc\u00e9ens from Concarneau were being treated. The rest of the class was held on a boat with psychological councillors before being taken back to their youth hostel,\u201d she told the local newspaper. The former prime minister David Cameron has tweeted this. Rex Tillerson, the new US secretary of state, said the thoughts and prayers of the American people were with the UK. He said: We condemn these horrific acts of violence, and whether they were carried out by troubled individuals or by terrorists, the victims know no difference. The White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, said that President Trump had spoken by phone to Theresa May about the incident, adding that the US was continuing to monitor the situation. \u201cWe obviously condemn today\u2019s attack in Westminster,\u201d he told reporters, noting that the UK government was treating it as a terrorist incident. We applaud the quick response of British police and first responders. Spicer said \u201cour thoughts and prayers\u201d are with the victims and the UK has the \u201cfull support of the US government in bringing those responsible to justice\u201d. \u2022 Assistant commissioner, Mark Rowley, head of counterterrorism, confirmed that four people have died including one police officer and the attacker. \u2022 Attacker ploughed into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge before crashing into the railing of the Houses of Parliament and exiting the car to continue the attack. \u2022 Attacker then stabbed one of the armed officers protecting parliament, who has died. \u2022 Police are currently working on the assumption that there was only one attacker. \u2022 Two people died on Westminster Bridge \u2022 At least 20 people have been injured, including three police officers who were returning from a commendation ceremony. \u2022 The public should expect a heavier police presence on the streets of London in forthcoming days. He said: \u201cPlease be vigilant you will see more police officers armed and unarmed on the streets of London.\u201d \u2022 Police have deployed massive resources but they can call on the military if needed. Rowley said: This is a day we\u2019ve planned for but hoped would never happen, sadly it\u2019s now a reality. Police confirm that four people have died in the London attack today, including one police officer and the attacker. Officers believe there was only one attacker at this stage. At least twenty people have been injured. President Trump has spoken to Theresa May about the incident, NBC News reports. A picture of the suspected attacker being treated by emergency services at the scene outside the Palace of Westminster has emerged. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, has issued this statement about the attack. My thoughts are with everyone caught up in the dreadful incident at Westminster today, including the emergency services who responded bravely to ensure the safety of the many people nearby. Following the incident the Scottish government has been liaising closely with Police Scotland and the cabinet secretary for Justice has been briefed by the chief constable. This afternoon our officials held a Scottish government resilience (SGoRR) meeting with Police Scotland, to ensure that any potential implications for Scotland are considered and I will convene a Ministerial SGoRR meeting later this evening. We have been in regular dialogue with the parliament and I fully support the decision of the presiding officer to suspend proceedings this afternoon. It should be made clear, however, that this was not because of any specific threat to the parliament or to Scotland We are liaising with our counterparts in the UK government and the Scottish government stands ready to support in any way we can. Reports of heroic behaviour from the MP and minister Tobias Ellwood, who has been pictured trying to resuscitate the police officer stabbed by an assailant. The Conservative MP for Bournemouth East is a former armed serviceman with The Royal Green Jackets. His brother, Jon, died in the 2002 Bali bombings. Daily Telegraph chief political correspondent tweeted that he saw Ellwood being comforted in New Palace Yard after his attempts to save the police officer\u2019s life. The BBC is reporting that Ellwood has said that the officer died at the scene. A police officer is addressing us now. (By us, I mean the journalists and other people working in the Commons being held in Westminster Hall.) He says there has been a significant incident, and outside the building, New Palace Yard, is a crime scene. We are also witnesses, he says. So we will be held here for about 60 to 90 minutes. After about an hour and a quarter they will take details from people. After that we will be allowed to leave, he says. A second official is speaking now. He says they will prioritise anyone who needs medical help. Then they will pass around details allowing us to upload pictures and video of the incident. That will save them having to seize phones, he says. Finally, they will \u201ctriage\u201d witnesses, he says. He says this will require patience. People in other buildings are going through the same process. He asks anyone with medical needs to make themselves available. In about half an hour they will pass round information about how to submit evidence, he says. The Muslim Council of Britain has issued the following statement: We are shocked and saddened by the incident at Westminster. We condemn this attack and while it is still too early to speculate on the motives, our thoughts and prayers are for the victims and those affected. We pay tribute too to the police and emergency services who handled this with bravery. The Palace of Westminster is the centre of our democracy and we must all ensure that it continues to serve our country and its people with safety and security. The Guardian understands that a police officer has been killed in the London attack. Another police press conference is expected shortly. The Speaker of the House of Commons and the Speaker of the House of Lords have issued a statement: An extremely serious incident has occurred in the Westminster area this afternoon. The Metropolitan police is dealing with this and an investigation is under way. On behalf of members of both Houses of Parliament, we wish to offer our thoughts to all those affected and their families. We would also like to express our gratitude to the police and all emergency services. The journalists who were in the press gallery are now being held in Westminster Hall. Armed police seem to be searching the Palace of Westminster room by room \u2013 quite an undertaking, because it\u2019s a rabbit warren, with endless cellars, cubby holes, etc. And I\u2019ve just seen a team go into the room where the Westminster Hall chamber is, guns raised as if they were on the alert. We\u2019re told that they believe there may still be one suspect on the loose. The French prime minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, has confirmed that a number of French students were among casualties on Westminster Bridge. Some witnesses said a group of French students were present. Unconfirmed French media reports also state that students were present on Westminster Bridge at the time of the attack and that three have been hospitalised. There are no details as to their condition. Journalist Polly Boiko tweeted: The Labour MP Clive Efford wrote the following tribute to the work of those in the House of Commons: Estimate about three to four hundred MPs on lockdown together in the HoCs. We\u2019re huddling around TVs in the voting lobbies to find out what is going on. There is a calm quietness around the place. We all knew a day like could come. One of our police officers guarding the Palace of Westminster has been stabbed and have just heard the terrible news that a person has died. Our thoughts go out to those who have been injured and the family of the person who has died. The staff and police of the House of Commons are doing a fantastic job. They know that this building is very high on the list as a possible terrorist target which puts them at risk. They have been calmly going about their business and are showing complete dedication throughout this incident. They deserve a great deal of praise. We are all extremely grateful to them. We\u2019ve closed our GuardianWitness callout for eyewitness accounts as the Metropolitan police is asking for witnesses to share images and video with them. If you have any information here\u2019s the link. The Port of London Authority has confirmed that a seriously injured woman has been recovered from the Thames river. Spokesman Martin Garside said: A female member of the public was recovered alive from the water, but with serious injuries. She has been brought ashore and is undergoing urgent medical treatment. The working assumption is that she fell or jumped from the bridge. He added: The river is completely shut between Vauxhall Bridge and the Embankment. It was shut down almost immediately. A police officer has just come into the Guardian office in the Commons. Journalists are being asked to leave the press gallery, and the police don\u2019t know if, or when, we will be allowed back. That means this blog will now be in the hands of my colleague Alexandra Topping. Here is an extract from the statement from the Metropolitan police commander, BJ Harrington. Although we remain open-minded to the motive, a full counter-terrorism investigation is already under way. This is led by the Met counter-terrorism command. At this stage I will confirm what we know has happened but I will not speculate. We received a number of different reports which included a person in the river, a car in collision with pedestrians and a man armed with a knife. Officers were already in that location as part of routine policing but immediately additional officers were sent to the scene and that included firearms officers. We are working closely with the London ambulance service and the London fire brigade ... We know there are a number of casualties, including police officers, but at this stage we cannot confirm numbers or the nature of these injuries ... The acting commissioner, Craig Mackey, is being treated as a significant witness as he was at the scene when the incident started. Whilst he is not injured, it would be inappropriate for him to be here to talk about this incident at this stage. Our thoughts and his thoughts are with all those involved and responding to that incident this evening. I would stress that if anyone has information about today\u2019s incident they are urged to call 0800789321 and I want to stress that if the public have any information or see anything suspicious to dial 999 immediately. The London ambulance service deputy director of operations, Pauline Cranmer, has confirmed that they have treated at least 10 patients on Westminster Bridge. He said: We can confirm we have treated at least 10 patients on Westminster Bridge and have put a number of hospitals on alert as we continue to respond to this incident. We were called at 2.40pm today, with the first ambulance crew arriving within six minutes. We have sent a number of resources to the scene including ambulance crews, London\u2019s air ambulance and our Hazardous Area Response Team. We are working closely with other members of the emergency services at the scene, with our priority being to ensure patients receive the medical help they need as quickly as possible. We have declared a major incident and our priority is to assess patients and ensure that they are treated and taken to hospital as soon as possible. As we are very busy dealing with this incident, we would ask the public to only call us in a genuine emergency. \u2022 Commander BJ Harrington said there were a number of casualties but would not confirm any fatalities or the nature of injuries. \u2022 \u201cWe know there are a number of casualties including police officers but at this stage we can not confirm numbers or the nature of these injuries,\u201d he said. \u2022 Craig Mackay, the acting Met commissioner, is being treated as a \u201csignificant witness\u201d as he was at the scene when the attack started. \u2022 An investigation was launched immediately after the force received a number of different reports, which included a person in the river, a car in collision with pedestrians and a man armed with a knife. This is from ITV\u2019s Chris Ship. At 4.40pm some MPs and visitors to parliament were led out through Westminster Hall, the oldest part of the Palace of Westminster, walking across the corner of New Palace Yard where the incident occurred. There are still around 20 police cars, at least six ambulances and five fire engines on Parliament Square, next to the New Palace Yard entrance. Q: Is the incident over? Harrington says officers are still at the scene. And that\u2019s it. His briefing is over. Commander BJ Harrington from the Metropolitan police is speaking to reporters now. Firearms officers were sent to the scene, he says. He appeals to the public to avoid areas around Westminster. This is to allow emergency services to deal with the \u201congoing incident\u201d. He says there are a number of injuries, including police. He says extra police officers are being deployed across the capital. The acting commissioner is a significant witness, because he was at the scene, he says. He asks anyone with information about this to call the police. The Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood gave mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to the policeman who was stabbed, the Telegraph\u2019s Ben Riley-Smith says. World leaders have begun to react with shock to the incident in Westminster in which at least one person has died. The US president, Donald Trump, described the incident as \u201cbig news\u201d after he was updated on the situation. Trump told reporters: \u201cI was just getting an update on London \u2026 some big news having to do with London just happened,\u201d according NBC. The US State Department said it was ready to assist the UK authorities in any way. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said: \u201cWe are following the concerning situation outside the UK parliament. Our hearts go out to those affected. We stand ready to assist in any way the UK authorities would find helpful. The safety and security of US citizens overseas is one of our priorities. Our embassy in London is monitoring the situation closely.\u201d The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, said: \u201cHorrible images from London. The very heart of the city has been struck. Our thoughts are with the British people.\u201d Gibraltar\u2019s chief minister, Fabian Picardo, said: \u201cShocked at attack on London. Yesterday I spent the day at Westminster. Luckily not today. London\u2019s Parliament is the mother of democracy!\u201d The Met police are appealing for pictures or video footage of the incident. In Victoria Street teams of firefighters, some arriving in unmarked cars, have gathered and are pulling on burgundy overalls with the word \u201crescue\u201d on the back. They appear to be wearing body armour and helmets and are moving towards parliament. Speaking to reporters outside the central London hospital, junior doctor Colleen Anderson from St Thomas\u2019 hospital has said a female pedestrian had died. She also said she treated a police officer in his 30s with a head injury who had been taken to King\u2019s College hospital. She said: \u201cI confirmed one fatality. A woman. She was under the wheel of a bus. She died, confirmed her death at the scene.\u201d Anderson said: \u201cThere were people across the bridge. There were some with minor injuries, some catastrophic. Some had injuries they could walk away from ...[others] have life-changing injuries. There were maybe a dozen [injured].\u201d London mayor Sadiq Khan has issued a statement. The London mayor said an urgent investigation is underway and his thoughts are with those affected and their families. He also expressed his thanks to the police and emergency services for their rapid response.

A meeting of Cobra, the government\u2019s crisis committee, is expected to meet later with senior officials from government, counter-terrorism officials and the police present. The Labour MP Barry Sheerman has tweeted a series of pictures showing MPs locked in the Commons chamber. The intelligence agencies immediately put together teams to work on identifying who was involved in the attack and whether there was a link to a terrorist group. If the attacker or attackers are from the UK, the domestic intelligence service MI5, which works closely with the police, will be looking at whether they were part of a wider network and working to track down associates. The overseas intelligence agency MI6 will seek to establish whether there are any links to terrorists organisations in other countries. One of the first questions raised will be whether the attacker or attackers had been under surveillance. The immediate response of the intelligence agents would be that if they had someone under surveillance and became aware an attack was imminent, they would have stepped in. But MI5 does not have the resources to maintain 24-hour surveillance on all possible suspects and has to make hard choices about who poses the highest risk. Although symbolically parliament is one of the most high-profile targets in the UK, it is also one of the most heavily guarded. Without the high level of security, the casualty list could have been much higher. Holyrood\u2019s sitting to debate Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s independence referendum demand was suspended at just after 15.55, after parliament authorities reversed an earlier decision to keep sitting. About 20 minutes after his deputy Linda Fabiani told MSPs it would be \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d, Ken McIntosh, the Scottish parliament\u2019s presiding officer, told MSPs he was postponing the debate out of respect for Holyrood\u2019s \u201csister parliament\u201d. He said: Members will know that there has been a serious incident at Westminster and Westminster has been locked down because of security concerns. I have certainly no reason to cause undue alarm here and security has been increased here. Mike Jephcott, 38, was working at the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors which overlooks Parliament Square when he heard three gunshots. \u201cI looked at my colleague and said \u2018I\u2019m sure that\u2019s gunshots\u2019. There was panic and people running around,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cPolice were running around.\u201d \u201cWe saw the car on the side down by Big Ben. It was quite scary. Our offices were on lockdown and we have been asked to evacuate now.\u201d More from Kirsten Hurrell, who witnessed the incident from her newspaper kiosk in Parliament Square. (See 3.51pm.) Hurrell said that the car had come to a halt following shots. \u201cThere were shots to stop the car. The car turned, went completely over the cycle lane and rammed nose-first into the parliamentary fence. There was someone on the ground on the right of the car. They didn\u2019t look very good.\u201d Hurrell said her family had had her Newsstand kiosk for nearly 100 years. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised by what happened,\u201d she said. \u201cThis was always potentially a hot spot. I lived through the IRA incidents. We have got a lot of experience with terrorism. With what\u2019s going on in the world it\u2019s not surprising.\u201d The emergency services had responded amazingly, she said. \u201cThey were magnificent. Quick to respond and quick to evacuate.\u201d Matt Haikin, 44, from London who works in international development was on the scene immediately after one person was hit by a car and as shots were fired inside the parliament grounds. He told the Guardian he feared another Paris attack was under way. \u201cI was cycling from the West End up the Embankment and saw a black car on the pavement right next to Big Ben with the front all smashed in with a body next to it. I thought it was just an accident and carried on cycling past and noticed people running around and I thought \u2018what is going on\u2019. A few seconds later I heard shots coming from inside the parliament grounds. I then realised this was not just another accident.\u201d He said the body next to the car \u201cwasn\u2019t moving and there was a lot of blood\u201d. \u201cThere were students shouting because there was a lot of blood. It felt like about 10 seconds after [that I heard the shots] but it could have been a bit longer because by that point I was starting to get a bit scared. I think there were three or four shots but I couldn\u2019t swear to that.\u201d He said the shots came from the yard in front of the Palace of Westminster. \u201cAs I looked [through the railings] there were people milling around and I think a couple of bodies on the floor. I couldn\u2019t tell if they were injured or had just been asked to lay down. The police at that point started to appear and were moving everybody back. \u201cI felt shock. At the point that I thought maybe this was a bigger thing I started to get scared, but it calmed down pretty quickly and then it was just, shit, what is going on.\u201d There is no official estimate of the number injured in the incidents today in Westminster, but police fear they may run into double digits. An eyewitness has told Sky News that he saw a body in the Thames after the car drove into people on Westminster Bridge. The London Eye has stopped and is currently holding all its \u201cguests\u201d within the attraction. This Spanish tourist says he has been held for more than 20 minutes and has posted an image on Twitter. The Scottish parliament has now suspended its sitting. This is from Humza Yousaf, a minister in the Scottish government. Here are tweets from some MPs on the parliamentary estate. Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 hospital in Westminster is currently in lockdown, according to reports. The hospital said \u201cstaff and visitors at St Thomas\u2019 and Evelina London hospitals are being advised to remain on site during the current security incident.\u201d After giving urgent medical attention to two injured people in Old Palace Yard - including CPR - medics have taken away one person in an ambulance. Another person remains prone on the cobbles, covered completely in a blanket. It seems certain they are dead. It is not known who the two people are, police, a potential attacker or attackers, or others. UPDATE: This is clearly a difficult time for the police as they widen the cordon around Parliament Square. Three vans bringing 16 officers as reinforcements just screeched up Victoria Street under blue lights. One man confronted an officer and demanded to know why he couldn\u2019t pass through the cordon and complained it was a free country. \u201cNot at the moment it isn\u2019t,\u201d the officer replied. Tom McTague, chief UK political correspondent for Politico, has tweeted that police officers are walking across Whitehall towards Westminster Bridge with sniffer dogs. Kirsten Hurrell, 70, was at her newspaper kiosk in Parliament Square when the incident happened. What I heard myself was a crash. I looked up. I saw this car ploughing into the parliament fence. I thought initially it was some kind of accident. Then I heard a couple of sharp noises. It could have been gunshots. I wasn\u2019t sure. There was a lot of steam from the car. I thought it might explode. I telephoned the police but someone had already called them. I heard from someone else that the car had mown down people on the bridge. I saw myself someone lying on the floor near the car. It looked like a cyclist. The car was in the fence. Hurrell said she fled the scene without locking up her kiosk outside Portcullis House, home to dozens ofMPs. There was a lot of steam coming out of the car. It looked like steam rather than smoke. I thought it was going to explode. London Ambulance Service deputy director of operations, Pauline Cranmer, said: We were called at 2.40pm to Westminster Bridge to reports of an incident, with the first crew arriving within six minutes. We have sent a number of resources to the scene including ambulance crews, London\u2019s Air Ambulance and our Hazardous Area Response Team. We are working closely with other members of the emergency services at the scene, with our priority being to ensure patients receive the medical help they need as quickly as possible. We have declared a major incident and our priority is to assess patients and ensure that they are treated and taken to hospital as soon as possible. As we are very busy dealing with this incident, we would ask the public to only call us in a genuine emergency. John Stevens, the Daily Mail\u2019s deputy political editor tweeted the below, from an apparently eye-witness perspective at 3.17pm. As news of the attack at Westminster broke, Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister hurried from the debating chamber at Holyrood midway through the debate on her new Scottish independence referendum bid. It is thought Sturgeon may be heading for a meeting of the Scottish government\u2019s security and resilience committee. However, there was no obvious change in the level of policing and security at Holyrood where parliamentary business continued uninterrupted. Murdo Fraser, the Scottish Tory economy spokesman, raised a point of order during the debate asking whether the sitting should be suspended due to events at Westminster. Linda Fabiani, the deputy presiding officer, said the Holyrood authorities would not suspend the sitting. \u201cIt has been considered and it has been decided to carry on with business as usual,\u201d she told Fraser. The police says no terrorists have got into the parliament building. We have been evacuated from Portcullis House to Norman Shaw North, the building next door. MPs have been told to go back to their rooms. We are being told conflicting information about where to go. I\u2019m currently penned in a corridor with hundreds of people. Owen Bennett, deputy political editor of the Huffington Post, posted an account on Twitter. He said: I heard what sounded like an explosion and raised voices outside parliament, and so I rushed to the window. I saw people running past the entrance to the New Palace Yard entrance to parliament and then at least one person try to run into the Yard itself. A police officer chased this person and wrestled them to ground. Shots were then fired but I can\u2019t remember how many and I didn\u2019t see who fired them. I ran down the stairs from my office overlooking the Yard to get more information, but the police prevented us from leaving the stairwell. When I returned to my office, I could see two people lying on the ground outside Westminster Hall, but neither of these were the person I saw wrestled down by the police officer minutes earlier. Quentin Letts, the Daily Mail\u2019s parliamentary sketchwriter, said he saw a man in black attack a police officer outside Parliament before being shot two or three times as he tried to storm into the House of Commons, the Press Association reports. \u201cI saw a thick-set man in black clothes come through the gates into New Palace Yard, just below Big Ben,\u201d he told the BBC. He had something in his hand, it looked like a stick of some sort, and he was challenged by a couple of policemen in yellow jackets. And one of the yellow-jacketed policemen fell down and we could see the man in black moving his arm in a way that suggested he was stabbing or striking the yellow-jacketed policeman. The other officer ran to get help and the man in black ran about 15 yards towards the entrance, he said. He added: As this attacker was running towards the entrance two plain-clothed guys with guns shouted at him what sounded like a warning, he ignored it and they shot two or three times and he fell. This is to allow the emergency services to deal with the ongoing incident. Officers - including firearms officers - remain on the scene and we are treating this as a terrorist incident until we know otherwise. We thank the public for their assistance. I\u2019m outside Downing Street - 200 metres from Parliament Square - where police are in force and there is a nervy mood. Met officers have taped off the pavement and are clearing the public - tourists, workers, passersby - back towards Trafalgar Square. Unmarked police vehicles have blocked off the road to parliament at Horse Guards Parade. A helicopter is flying low above the Foreign Office and the PM\u2019s residence. Trafalgar Square is a log-jam of buses and cars. \u201cIt\u2019s a serious incident, sir. Please keep moving,\u201d one officer said. I\u2019m at the police cordon at Victoria Street and Parliament Square. Police are telling the public to move back for their own safety. One constable said there were \u201cvarious serious incidents going on. It\u2019s not safe to be around here at the moment\u201d. The police are clearly agitated. There\u2019s an air ambulance and about 15 police vehicles in the otherwise deserted square. Outside Westminster Abbey, groups of tourists are taking snaps oblivious of this afternoon\u2019s incident. A senior police source has confirmed that Scotland Yard\u2019s counter-terrorism command was involved in an investigation following this afternoon\u2019s incidents. The early police view emerging from the chaos is that there were probably two sites of attack: Westminster Bridge where people may have been run over, and parliament itself, where it appears an officer was stabbed and the attacker shot. Plans for a London-wide emergency have been put into place as a precaution. Police are hopeful the incidents are over. Theresa May, the prime minister, was rushed into a car 40 yards from the gates outside parliament where shots were fired minutes after the incident occurred, according to footage filmed by a member of staff. She was ushered by at least eight armed undercover police, some with their firearms drawn, into a waiting black vehicle in Speaker\u2019s Court, the footage seen by the Guardian shows. Loud bangs can be heard in the background as she is ushered into the car, but it is unclear whether the bangs were gunshots. There have been two serious incidents near the British parliament. Police have confirmed they are currently treating the events as a terrorist incident. A police officer has been stabbed inside the gate of the Houses of Parliament in central London, the Commons leader, David Lidington, has said. The Guardian understands that a police officer has been killed in the attack. The alleged assailant was shot by armed police following a \u201cserious\u201d incident. There are further reports of a car driving into a number of people on Westminster Bridge, before driving into the railings of the Palace of Westminster. Police fear the number of injured is in \u201cdouble digits\u201d. The London Ambulance Service confirmed they have treated ten victims. Westminster is currently in lockdown with MPs told to remain in the main chamber or in their offices. Scotland Yard said it was called to a firearms incident on Westminster Bridge amid reports of several people injured. Transport for London said Westminster underground station has been shut at the police\u2019s request. The aftermath of the apparent knife attack, which seemingly saw the attacker shot by police, could be seen in Old Palace Yard, the courtyard directly outside parliament. At least one person could be seen prone on the ground, tended to by ambulance staff. An air ambulance landed on the grass of Parliament Square, and medical crews rushed in. However, they soon stepped back, and there was no sign of anyone being taken away. While police looked clam, dozens of armed officers could be seen in the area. At one point, a group of about a dozen officers armed with guns arrived, some also carrying shields. They marched into parliament. More from the Met police ... Some pictures from the scene. Here is David Lidington\u2019s statement to MPs about 20 minutes ago in full. Colleagues will have appreciated that events have been moving rapidly and I want to emphasise that the knowledge that I have which is definite is so far very limited. What I am able to say to the House is that there has been a serious incident within the estate. It seems that a police officer has been stabbed; that the alleged assailant was shot by armed police. An air ambulance is attending the scene to remove the casualties. There are also reports of further violent incidents in the vicinity. BBC journalist Andrew Neil has tweeted that \u201cpara-military\u201d style police are currently all over Westminster. Commons leader David Lidington has told MPs a \u201cpolice officer has been stabbed\u201d and the \u201calleged assailant was shot by armed police\u201d following a serious incident within the parliamentary estate, PA reported. In a packed House of Commons, Lidington said: At the moment the very clear advice from the police and director of security in the house is we should remain under suspension and the chamber remain in lockdown until we receive advice that it is safe. Sky have spoken to an eyewitness who said he saw a 4x4 vehicle crash into a person and a railing near Parliament, before the driver fled. This is from the Daily Mail\u2019s Jason Groves. More from the Press Association. Minutes after the incident, an emergency services helicopter landed in Parliament Square, as sirens were heard outside. Air ambulance medics came from the helicopter to assist the casualties. Two people lay on the ground in the yard. One of them appeared to have had clothes removed as emergency workers attempted to resuscitate the pair. Parliament Square was closed to traffic. An ambulance entered the gates to New Palace Yard. Witness Don Brind told the Press Association he heard shots being fired and saw two people apparently injured on the ground. Brind, a researcher for MPs, said: \u201cI heard some shouting and saw some running out of the corner of my eye and then a short time after that there was a shot. I looked and I saw a civilian on the ground, with somebody standing over him with what I assumed to be a gun. \u201cThen I looked and about 10 yards away, there was a yellow jacketed person on the ground, who appeared to be alive and talking.\u201d He said he assumed the person in the high-visibility jacket was a police officer. Pictures emerged of a car having crashed into the railings of Parliament at the end of Westminster Bridge Press Association reporter Laura Harding, who was in Westminster at the time of the incident, said: \u201cEveryone has been evacuated into Central Lobby, including a group of schoolchildren and kitchen staff. \u201cAround 15 schoolchildren aged around 10, with armed police coming through the lobby now. \u201cThe children are really calm, the teachers are comforting them. \u201cEveryone is standing around on their phones. \u201cThere are also a bunch of young people from the Hammersmith Boxing Club in their tracksuits and the British Lionhearts boxing group.\u201d Dennis Burns, who was just entering Parliament for a meeting when the security alert happened, told the Press Association: \u201cAs I was coming through the doors at Portcullis House, a policeman grabbed someone who was coming in and threw him out. \u201cAs we were coming though the glass doors I was told by one security guard to get out while another one told me to get in. \u201cAs I walked in I heard a security guard get a radio message saying \u2018a policeman has been stabbed\u2019. \u201cThen I walked in as police officers and security start rushing out of the front doors on to the street. \u201cWhen I got inside I was wondering what the hell was going on and I saw dozens of panicked people running down the street. The first stream was around 30 people and the second stream was 70 people. \u201cIt looked like they were running for their lives.\u201d Rados\u0142aw Sikorski, a Polish politician, has spoken to the BBC saying: I didn\u2019t see a car but I heard what I thought was a collision, I looked through the window of the taxi and I saw someone down obviously in great distress. He then saw a further four people down on the ground, \u201cone bleeding profusely\u201d, he said. According to Reuters, two people have been shot and at least a dozen injured. These are from the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg. Lidington says the advice from the police is that the sitting should remain suspended, and that MPs should remain in the chamber. David Lidington, the leader of the Commons, is making a statement to MPs. He says an alleged assailant was shot by police. He says he cannot go into further details. Luke Steele, a Campaigns Manager for Animal Aid has tweeted a picture from the scene. MPs were told to wait in the Commons chamber when the sitting was suspended. Unconfirmed reports of a car involved in the incident on Westminster Bridge, it is being treated as a \u201cfirearms incident\u201d say police at the scene. Rados\u0142aw Sikorski, a senior fellow at CES Harvard has tweeted that a car has hit five people. An air ambulance has landed on Parliament Square. More from the Met police. ITV\u2019s Paul Brand has a periscope of the scene outside the Houses of Parliament. This is from the Press Association. There was a major security alert at the Palace of Westminster after a man apparently carrying a knife charged through the gates into the front yard of the parliamentary compound. Amid shouts and screams, sounds similar to gunfire rang out. Two people were seen to be lying within Old Palace Yard, immediately outside Westminster Hall. The sitting in the House of Commons was suspended while police officers sealed off the area around the incident. Immediately before the incident, at around 2.45pm, a crowd of passers-by was seen running from the direction of Westminster Bridge and around the corner into Parliament Square. This is from the Daily Mail\u2019s Quentin Letts, the paper\u2019s parliamentary sketch writer. He works in the Commons. This is from the Met Police. The Press Association has snapped this. Sounds similar to gunfire have been heard close to the Palace of Westminster. A man with a knife has been seen within the confines of the Palace, eyewitnesses said. This is from the FT\u2019s Jim Pickard. He was in Portcullis House a few minutes ago. My colleague Jessica Elgot is in Portcullis House. She can see 10 to 20 police officers running to the front of the building. About five minutes ago she saw a lot of people running along the street alongside. I\u2019m in the Guardian office in the press gallery at the Commons. Security officials have told us to stay where we are. In the Commons chamber the sitting has been suspended. There are reports of a shooting at the Commons. In Edinburgh MSPs will soon resume their debate on the SNP\u2019s motion calling for a second independence referendum. Before it starts, here is a reading list. Simon Johnson in the Daily Telegraph says an SNP MP will tell Nicola Sturgeon today not to call a referendum until public opinion has shifted. Nicola Sturgeon will be advised by one of her most senior colleagues to postpone a second independence referendum until she has overcome Scots\u2019 opposition to it. Alex Neil, a former Scottish Government Minister, is to tell Holyrood on Wednesday that calling a rerun of the 2014 vote without strong public support for another poll would damage the Nationalists\u2019 chances of victory. Speaking ahead of the conclusion of a two-day Scottish Parliament debate on a second referendum, Mr Neil told the Telegraph said Ms Sturgeon has \u201cto make sure people are with us\u201d before committing to a timetable. Tom Gordon in the Herald says yesterday\u2019s debate was particularly bad tempered. In the key vote before the first referendum, MSPs unanimously agreed in November 2013 to pass the required bill. There was no such consensus yesterday. It was trench warfare ... The pro-UK parties tried to put a question mark over the final decision, which is non-binding, pointing out the SNP government has ignored a series of awkward votes against it of late, yet now holds up a vote in the Scottish Parliament as the pinnacle of democracy. There was also a slew of insults. One SNP MSP said there was a gang of social media \u201cabusers\u201d on the Labour side, while a Tory likened Ms Sturgeon to \u201ca fanatic\u201d. Some say the first referendum was a giant party. The next looks like the monstrous hangover. Severin Carrell in the Guardian says Nicola Sturgeon was accused of hypocrisy in yesterday\u2019s debate after she insisted Theresa May had to respect Holyrood\u2019s call for a second independence referendum. Kenny Farquharson in the Times (paywall) says he thinks Scotland will leave the EU. Last time, people such as myself, arguing for a \u201cno\u201d vote, were able to talk of the UK as a force for good in the world \u2014 liberal, tolerant, multicultural, diverse, with a dynamic popular culture, fizzing with creative energy. This is still true, to an extent. But it has been obscured for the moment by a Brexit campaign that has emboldened an atavistic side of Britain that, to Scottish eyes, is not only foreign but alien. This is a Britain that turns away refugee children fleeing war. This does not feel like home. This does not feel like a country worth fighting for. It feels less precious than before. In 2014 the UK survived because turnout in No areas was higher than turnout in Yes areas. I find it hard to imagine, next time, the same rush to the polling stations to rescue this Union ... Another factor is the apparent inability of Theresa May to envisage a Brexit Britain that involves good news for Scotland. I was speaking to a source close to the first minister last week who admitted that if the prime minister had packaged up some key powers to be repatriated from the EU and presented them to Holyrood last month, tied up with a neat tartan ribbon, it would have made it very hard for Ms Sturgeon to have taken the first step last week towards a new referendum. ITV\u2019s Peter MacMahon says the Scottish Greens are being criticised for siding with the nationalists. And, for anyone who is interested, here is the record of yesterday\u2019s debate (pdf). Theresa May was accused by Jeremy Corbyn of breaching a Conservative manifesto pledge not to cut education funding, prompting her to launch a personal attack on the Labour frontbench for sending their children to private and grammar schools. May has defended the Conservative party\u2019s response to the accusations that led to it receiving a record \u00a370,000 fine for not properly declaring election expenses. At PMQs the SNP\u2019s Pete Wishart asked: Last week the Electoral Commission issued its largest-ever fine on the Conservative party for breaking vital and crucial election rules. What did the prime minister, the cabinet, her aides, know about any of this activity? Who was responsible for designing and signing off all of this? Do you agree with me that this is at best woeful negligence, and at worst pure electoral fraud? May replied: You are asking me to respond to what is a party matter, but I can assure you that the Conservative party did campaign in 2015 across the country for the return of a Conservative government, and we should be clear that such campaigning will be part of the party\u2019s national return, not candidates\u2019 local return, as the Electoral Commission itself has said. The party accepted in April 2016 it had made an administrative error on its national spending, it brought that to the attention of the Electoral Commission in order to amend its national return. As I say, national electoral spending is a question for the national party, not for individual members. The Electoral Commission has looked into these issues, as it has for issues for the Liberal Democrat party and the Labour party. It has issued fines to all three parties and those fines will be paid. May has said that MPs will get a free vote on the proposals to decant from the House of Parliament to an alternative Westminster venue to allow multi-billion repair works to be carried out. Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, has told MPs that an \u201cevolving threat\u201d led to his decision to impose the laptop cabin ban on flights from some countries. In response to an urgent question in the Commons, he said: We respond in aviation security to the evolving threat that we face from terrorists. And there are some things that we make public and others that we don\u2019t. I\u2019m not going to give [MPs] full details of the background to the decision we have taken. It is a response to an evolving threat ... Suffice to say to the House, we have taken the steps that we have taken for good reason. Tim Farron, the Lib Dem leader, renewed is call for a referendum on the final Brexit deal, saying David Davis, the Brexit secretary, backed the idea until quite recently. Proposing a 10-minute rule bill on this, Farron told MPs: The secretary of state for Exiting the European Union not long ago made the case very eloquently for what is now the Liberal Democrat proposal. He used the phrases: \u2018mandate referendum\u2019, and \u2018decision referendum\u2019 ... I couldn\u2019t agree with the secretary of state more. It is a shame that the secretary of state doesn\u2019t agree with himself anymore. Farron was referring to this speech Davis gave in 2012. Labour should suspend MPs disloyal to Jeremy Corbyn, including Chuka Umunna and Wes Streeting, Ken Livingstone has said. The lord chief justice, Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd, has launched an attack on the justice secretary, Liz Truss, for her failure last year to defend judges who were branded \u201cenemies of the people\u201d. Talks aimed at restoring power sharing in Northern Ireland continued at Stormont in the hours after it was announced that the former deputy first minister Martin McGuinness had died. The SNP\u2019s Alan Brown says the announcement implies the government does not trust the security arrangements at airports in the countries affected. Grayling says he does not want this to be seen as a vote of no confidence in security arrangements in these countries. Tom Pursglove, a Conservative, asks what consultation there was with airlines before this was announced. Grayling says the government has been in regular contact with them over recent days. Grayling says he is not saying to people that they should not travel to the countries affected. Grayling says he hopes these measures will ultimately prove to be temporary. But decisions will be taken on the basis of passenger safety. Labour\u2019s Lilian Greenwood asks what discussions Grayling has had with his counterparts in other countries about the rules for transfer passengers. Grayling says the government has been in contract with other countries. They will take their own decisions. In the huddle for journalists after PMQs, Downing Street sources doubled down on May\u2019s personal remarks about where Jeremy Corbyn and other members of the shadow cabinet sent their children to school: and indeed where the Labour leader himself was educated. \u201cShe was clearly making the point that there seems to be one rule for the people mentioned, and another rule for the rest of us,\u201d the source said, adding that, \u201cconsistency\u201d was important in politics. Some of the Tory critics of the government\u2019s grammar schools, including Stroud MP Neil Carmichael, have admitted sending their own children to grammars. Labour\u2019s Derek Twigg asks if Grayling is confident that a terrorist would not be able to get a laptop with a bomb onto a plane leaving a UK airport. Grayling says he thinks security at UK airports as high as anywhere in the world. He says the government is happy with the rules currently in place, but keeps them under review. The SNPs\u2019 transport spokesman, Drew Hendry, asks what extra resources will be made to UK airports to help them deal with this. Grayling says these rules do not apply to UK airports. But the government has asked them to \u201cthink ahead\u201d in case that changes. Sir Desmond Swayne, a Conservative, asks why laptops etc are safer in the hold. Grayling says he cannot discuss this. Richard Burden, the shadow transport minister, asks if there is a risk posed by the countries affected. And why are the US rules different? What is being done to ensure passengers get the right information? He says there are \u201ctoo many loose ends\u201d in this announcement. He says Grayling should give more information about why this decision has been taken. Grayling says Labour was in power for 13 years. It knows that there are some things that cannot be said in public. There is an evolving threat to aircraft, he says. This is not about singling out countries. It is about protecting UK citizens. He says the rules will apply to transfer passengers. Grayling is responding to Shuker. He says the government responds to evolving threats. He says he will not discuss details. But he says the government has taken this step \u201cfor good reasons\u201d. He says the UK has decided what is best for the UK. He says it is for the airlines to resolve what happens to people on handluggage-only tickets. He will be writing to insurers to ask them to be mindful of the theft issue. This decision has been taken to protect passengers, he says. But the government cannot put all its reasons in the public domain. Labour\u2019s Gavin Shuker says this is a major change. Can Grayling explain why the US and UK bans are different? He says the Washington Post says the US were discussing changes for a fortnight. When did Grayling first lean of the US plans? Will Grayling harmonise the changes? That would make life easier for passengers, he says. What happens to people who travel on a handluggage-only ticket? What will the government do to stop items being stolen? What evidence is there that placing problematic items in the hold will be safer? Some batteries have been banned from holds because they are a risk. Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, is responding to the urgent question. He says the government will always take steps to protect the travelling public. He outlines the countries involved. Partners in the region have had the decision explained to them, he says. The US made a similar announcement. The UK has been in close contact with them, he says. He says passengers boarding flights to the UK from the countries affected will not be able to take into the cabin a phone, tablet or laptop above a certain size. The Labour MP Gavin Shuker is now asking an urgent question on the cabin ban on laptops and tablets on inbound flights from six countries announced yesterday. Here is our story about this. And here is the written statement from Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, making the announcement. Labour\u2019s Jack Dromey says 96% of schools in Birmingham will lose \u00a320m under the new schools funding formula. But places like Windsor and Maidenhead will gain. How can this be fair? May says the current system is unfair. Some schools in London get twice as much as schools in other parts of the country. Anne-Marie Trevelyan, the Conservative, asks about the Jo Cox commission on loneliness and asks if May will meet women working on this. May says they are doing very good work. Labour\u2019s Julie Cooper says shocking pay rises have been given to Liverpool CCG. Will the government investigate failures in Liverpool CCG. May says NHS England is investigating this. Plaid Cymru\u2019s Jonathan Edwards says in triggering article 50 next week May is the modern day equivalent of Lord Cardigan at the Charge of the Light Brigade. May says in triggering article 50 she is responding to the will of the British people. Some of Corbyn\u2019s best PMQs have been on education, and on May\u2019s plans to extend grammar schools, and this was one of his best outings for weeks, although he was probably at his most effective in the first half of the exchange, when he was focusing on school funding, not selection. He put the figures about cuts well, and, for the first time in ages, resorted to the \u2018here\u2019s a question from a voter\u2019 tactic (once his hallmark), which today worked effectively. May was bland and unconvincing on the general funding point, although she was right to say that the school funding formula was an issue that governments have dodged for too long. She seemed much more animated defending grammars, the domestic policy initiative to which she seems most personally committed, but Corbyn held his ground well, helped by being able to quote Tories opposed to this. You could tell May was under pressure because resorted to the personal, attacking Corbyn for a decision about this son\u2019s education (which reportedly helped to break up his second marriage - he did not support his wife\u2019s desire to send their son to a grammar), but if you are going to go personal, you probably have to be ruthless to make it decisive, and May did not press her point, with the result that Corbyn was not thrown off his stride. So it was an effective performance by him, if not a decisive win. Robertson focused on two well-rehearsed SNP complaints: May\u2019s failure to reach an agreement with Scotland on Brexit, and her refusal to commit to offering Scotland an independence referendum. Both are relatively easy hits, although, in her second answer, May was able to come back with a particularly well-honed soundbite about how she is honouring the results of the UK\u2019s last two referendums, while the SNP is doing neither. (Regular readers will notice that the snap verdict now includes Angus Robertson. We\u2019ve decided to experiment with featuring him here, along with Jeremy Corbyn, because \u201cindyref2\u201d is now firmly on the agenda. Let us know what you think.) UPDATE: I\u2019ve corrected the paragraph above. It was Corbyn\u2019s second marriage that reportedly broke up partly because of the grammar school decision, not his first marriage. The SNP\u2019s Angus Robertson also offers condolences to the family and friends of Martin McGuinness. He says May said she would secure a UK-wide agreement before triggering article 50 on Brexit. Since then May has blocked, been intransigent and lectured. There is no agreement. Will these be May\u2019s tactics with the EU? May says she has made every effort to take into account the views of the devolved administrations. She wants the best possible deal for the people of Scotland. At heart we are one people. Robertson says May has admitted that she has reached no agreement. She wants the people to know the outcome of the Brexit deal before Scotland votes on independence. If the Commons, the Lords, the European parliament and EU parliaments can get a choice on Scotland\u2019s future after the deal is concluded, why shouldn\u2019t the Scottish people get a choice too? May says the people of Scotland voted to stay in the UK. The people of the UK voted to leave the EU. She is respecting both of those votes. Robertson is respecting neither. Corbyn says the former education secretary criticised grammar schools. Was he wrong? May says in grammar schools the attainment gap does not apply. Corbyn says the chair of the education committee has criticised grammar schools too. This is a vanity project. It will only benefit a few children. Is May happy to see this generation see its life chances decline. May says the government has protected school funding. There are more teachers with first class degrees. It is not a vanity project to want better schools. There is a difference between her and Corbyn. Corbyn recorded a video this week urging people to think of his movement first. That is the difference. Labour put the party first; she puts the country first. Corbyn says May was elected on a manifesto of no school cuts. But that is what is happening. He itemises things that are being cut. And he reads a letter from Eileen, a teacher, saying teachers are having to pay for pens and other items themselves. This is disgraceful. Does May agree? May says budgets and the pupil premium have been protected. She says what matters is the quality of education. That is what this government is about. She wants people to get on on the basis of merit, not privilege. That is what she is delivering. Labour has opposed every policy that has improved education. Corbyn says May should speak to the Tory MP Geoffrey Clifton-Brown who said all his schools would have a cut under this budget. But May found \u00a3320m for divisive grammar schools. What kind of priority is that? May says the new funding formula addresses a problem Labour ignored. MPs have been saying this for years. She said it 15 years ago when she was shadow education secretary. The government has proposed a new approach. She says the government has put money into offering diversity. She says Diane Abbott and Shami Chakrabarti sent their children to private schools. Corbyn sent his son to a grammar. He went to a grammar too. But now he wants to pull up the ladder. Jeremy Corbyn starts by echoing what May said about Martin McGuinness. He played an immeasurable role in bringing about peace in Northern Ireland, he says. He says the schools budget will be cut by 6.5% by 2020. And the new school funding formula will lead to some schools facing further cuts. Why is cutting tax for business more important? May says the government has plans to improve schools. The schools budget has been protected. The national funding formula is a consultation. Corbyn says the Tory manifesto said the amount of money following your child into school will be protected. No wonder even the Evening Standard editor is concerned. Is May advocating larger class sizes, a shorter school day or fewer teachers? May says there are more good teachers, and more outstanding schools. She believes in diversity in education; Corbyn believes in a one-size-fits-all model. Lucy Allan, a Conservative, asks if May will tell us how Telford will prosper from Brexit. May says the referendum was a vote not just to leave the EU, but to change the way the country works. That is why her plan for Britain sets out ideas to make a stronger Britain. It will deliver a more united country. Labour\u2019s John Mann says hospital units in Bassetlaw have been closed or cut back. He is offering to work with the PM to solve this. Will she work with him? May says the Bassetlaw clinical commissioning group is getting more funding. Mann talks about listening to local people. That is what sustainability and transformation plans are about. Theresa May says she would like to express her condolences to the family and colleagues of Martin McGuinness. She will not condone what he did in his early life but he played an indispensable role in taking the republican movement away from violence. This is from the Birmingham Post\u2019s Jonathan Walker. This is from the SNP\u2019s Pete Wishart. PMQs starts in about 10 minutes. Here is the list of MPs down to ask a question. There will be an urgent question after PMQs about the new restrictions on taking laptops into the cabin on some flights. YouGov has published its latest opinion poll. It suggests the Tories have a 16-point lead over Labour. And it suggests Theresa May (47%) has a 33-point lead over Jeremy Corbyn (14%) on who would make the best prime minister, although May is not that far ahead of the don\u2019t knows (39%). Teachers have voted to merge two unions to form a new super union for education workers, the Press Association reports. Members of the National Union of Teachers and the Association of Teachers and Lecturers backed the link up by more than 2-1. The National Education Union will be formed later in the year, representing 450,000 teachers and other education workers. It will be the biggest union in Europe for teachers and education professionals and the fourth biggest union in the UK. Given that Ken Livingstone has a theory on how Jeremy Corbyn can improve relations with the parliamentary Labour party (see 10.05am), perhaps he should apply for a new job that has been advertised on the w4mp website - Labour party \u201cpolitical liaison officer\u201d. The successful candidate will have to \u201chelp support and develop the relationship\u201d between, among others, Corbyn and Labour MPs. For a sense of how difficult a task this could be, do read Paul Waugh\u2019s account of Monday\u2019s extraordinary PLP meeting for Huffington Post. The person appointed will get a salary of \u00a340,000. And they will be on a fixed-term contract \u201cfor the period only that Corbyn is the leader of the Labour party\u201d. If you\u2019re still interested, you can find out more, including application details, here. And if you do get the job, good luck. You may need it. According to a story by Francis Elliott and Sam Coates in the Times (paywall), the plans for a new post-Brexit immigration law being drawn up by the government would involve penalties for employers and landlords who take on people without permission to live and work in the UK. Here\u2019s an extract. Businesses have been reassured that they will not face a \u201ccliff edge\u201d, with any changes brought in gradually and allowances made for low-skilled migration such as seasonal agricultural work. The leading options include work permits and a five-year working visa with strict curbs on benefit entitlements. Ministers privately admit, however, that businesses and private landlords will be made to shoulder much of the burden of policing the system, whatever is eventually introduced. \u201cWe will be making landlords and employers do a lot of the heavy lifting on the enforcement. That\u2019s the direction of travel,\u201d a senior minister involved in drawing up the system said. Landlords already face a maximum five year jail term for knowingly letting to illegals under the legislation that came into effect last year. That could increase as part of efforts to make them shoulder the burden of a new migration system. The Labour MP Wes Streeting has responded to Ken Livingstone, PoliticsHome\u2019s Kevin Schofield reports. Ken Livingstone, the former Labour mayor of London and veteran leftwinger, has been speaking to Radio 5 Live\u2019s Emma Barnett this morning. There were two news lines. Livingstone urged Jeremy Corbyn to suspend around a dozen Labour MPs most critical of his leadership. He said: Those that have been most over the top I think should be suspended. I think the other thing that Jeremy should do is re-introduce automatic re-selection. It\u2019s really ridiculous that MPs in safe seats have a job for life ... I\u2019m particularly talking about Chuka Umunna, Wes Streeting - basically it\u2019s the same group of MPs who were screaming that I\u2019d said Hitler was a Zionist and I was anti-semitic. The moment that issue went on hold, they were then blaming Jeremy for Britain voting to leave. Just endless criticism. It\u2019s only about a dozen of them. The simple fact is they are consciously undermining Jeremy and damaging the Labour party. He said that he would take Labour to judicial review if it refused to readmit him following his suspension for remarks about Hitler and zionism last year. A disciplinary hearing is due to take place shortly. Livingstone said he expected to lose that hearing, but that he thought he would win in the courts. I\u2019m afraid we\u2019ll have to be off to a judicial review in the courts and in the court the issue will be, what was actually said and what is the truth, and the Labour party has got no chance of winning a judicial review. I\u2019m basically retired. I\u2019m not seeking office. I haven\u2019t asked Jeremy or didn\u2019t ask Ed Miliband to send me to the House of Lords or anything like that. I\u2019m a house husband, but I\u2019m not having my political career defined at the end that I\u2019m anti-semitic. This is what the government has said in response to the Lords committee report warning that leaving the EU without a trade deal would cause \u201csignificant damage\u201d to the services sector. (See 9.11am.) A spokesman said: The prime minister has been clear that we will pursue a bold and ambitious free trade agreement with the European Union as a priority - it should allow for the freest possible trade in services, as well as goods, between Britain and the EU. On top of that, we believe a phased process of implementation will be in our mutual self interest - allowing UK and EU institutions, member states and businesses to prepare for the new arrangements. The nature of any interim arrangements will be a matter for negotiation. Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, is in Washington today for the conference about countering Islamic State (Isis). He is due to be meeting senior US officials including secretary of state Rex Tillerson, and as he arrived last night he tweeted a picture of himself with the US national security adviser, HR McMaster. The Tory MP Julian Knight won\u2019t be happy. He organised the letter signed by 76 mostly pro-leave MP complaining about the BBC giving too much prominence to reports conveying a negative impression of Brexit. Thankfully the duty Today editor isn\u2019t taking much notice because this morning the programme gave a prominent slot to Lord Whitty, chair of the Lords EU internal market sub-committee, which has today published a report saying the businesses in the service sector would face \u201csignificant damage\u201d if the UK left the EU without a trade deal. The government wants a trade deal but, as the Guardian reports, some cabinet ministers are saying they are relaxed about crashing out of the EU without a trade deal and instead having to rely on World Trade Organisations terms to trade with the EU. This is what Whitty said in a statement explaining why this is so important. The UK is the second largest exporter of services in the world and the EU receives 39% of the UK\u2019s non-financial service exports. This trade is critical to the UK\u2019s economy as it creates employment and supports goods exports - we can\u2019t afford to lose that. To protect the UK\u2019s status as a global leader of trade in services, the government will need to secure the most comprehensive FTA that has ever been agreed with the EU. Walking away from negotiations without a deal would badly damage UK plc, particularly in sectors such as aviation and broadcasting which have no WTO rules to fall back on. And here\u2019s an extract from the report explaining this case in more detail. Trade in services is inherently different from, and in many ways more complex than, trade in goods. Services are intangible and can be traded either online, in person, via a subsidiary business located in another territory or (increasingly) embedded within manufactured goods ... Unlike trade in goods, trade in services is largely unaffected by tariffs, but instead can be restricted by non-tariff barriers. Such barriers may not only increase the cost of trade but can also prohibit trade altogether. For example, without the right qualifications or licence, some UK service providers may not be able to deliver a service abroad ... A \u2018no deal\u2019 scenario, or a deal which gave no special consideration to UK trade in non-financial services, would risk significant damage to these sectors. For instance, WTO rules do not provide for trade with the EU in aviation or broadcasting services at all. Instead, UK firms would have to rely on outdated and restrictive agreements. While the UK\u2019s global standing in services may mitigate some negative consequences, faced with a \u2018no deal\u2019 scenario, businesses could be forced either to re-structure or relocate in order to continue to operate in the way that they do today. Moreover, WTO rules would also not sufficiently facilitate the cross-border movement of persons that supports the UK\u2019s trade in services with the EU, nor would they ensure the free flow of data. Rules on market access also differ between EU member states\u2014increasing the regulatory complexity for UK firms. We are likely to hear more about this this afternoon, when David Davis, the Brexit secretary, gives evidence to the Lords EU committee. Here is the agenda for the day. 10am: Nick Hurd, the business minister, gives a speech on industrial strategy to the Localis thinktank. 10.30am: Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd, the lord chief justice, gives evidence to the Lords constitution committee. 12pm: Theresa May faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs. 12.30pm: Tim Farron, the Lib Dem leader, proposes a 10-minute rule bill calling for a referendum on the final Brexit deal. Around 2.30pm: MSPs resume their debate on the SNP\u2019s call for a second independence referendum. They will vote at 5.30pm. 4pm: David Davis, the Brexit secretary, gives evidence to the Lords EU committee. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary after PMQs and another in the afternoon. You can read all today\u2019s Guardian politics stories here. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but normally I find it impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer direct questions, although sometimes I miss them or don\u2019t have time. Alternatively you could post a question to me on Twitter.",

But months after officials began wheeling him out for official events, Canadian diplomats in the US have been ordered to stop using cardboard cutouts of Justin Trudeau to promote their country. The life-size replicas were first spotted last summer at a bash organised by the Canadian consulate in Atlanta. Most recently, a two-dimensional Trudeau was on display for the South by Southwest arts festival in Austin, Texas. \u201cWe are aware of instances where our missions in the United States had decided to purchase and use these cutouts,\u201d Michael O\u2019Shaughnessy of Canada\u2019s global affairs department told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. \u201cThe missions have been asked to no longer use these for their events.\u201d One Pennsylvania-based company said it had sold between 10 and 20 cutouts of Trudeau since he became prime minister. The same company was contacted by the Canadian embassy in Washington, which, in the lead-up to Canada Day celebrations last year, placed a rush order for a cardboard Trudeau, spending C$147.79 (about US$111), including express delivery. Emails obtained by Canada\u2019s Conservative party hint at the internal debate that preceded the purchase, with one bureaucrat describing the replica as a \u201choot\u201d that would generate \u201csome serious selfie action\u201d. Another was more hesitant, arguing that \u201cit just doesn\u2019t seem very prime ministerial\u201d. The embassy went ahead with the order after it was noted that the US embassy in Ottawa had a two-dimensional Barack Obama in its diplomatic arsenal. While the global affairs department refused to detail why exactly the cutouts had now been banned, the use of Trudeau replicas at diplomatic events was blasted by the opposition Conservatives who said Canada\u2019s brand was about much more than the prime minister. The cardboard replicas had done well in capturing Trudeau\u2019s likeness, the party added, in a pointed jab at the prime minister. \u201cA life-size, two-dimensional cutout is probably a perfect metaphor for everything that Justin Trudeau represents,\u201d John Brassard, the Conservative party spokesman, told the CBC. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the shallow facade, and yet there\u2019s very little in the way of depth or substance there.\u201d",

Each of those trips was uncomfortable in its own unique way, but the visits did share a basic format.</p> <p>Merkel can expect to undergo a meet-and-greet with Trump in the Oval Office, with a photo opportunity; a private bilateral meeting with Trump; and, finally, a joint news conference. (Abe, like Trump an avid golfer, went in for the premium package, spending the whole weekend with the first family at Mar-a-Lago, the president\u2019s private Florida resort. Kenny, by contrast, got the basic package, which included a luncheon but not a news conference.)</p> <p>For a closer look at what Merkel might be in for, we\u2019ve broken down the previous trips by foreign leaders to the White House round by round. And we\u2019ve declared a winner for each round, based on who handled Trump best. </p> <h2>Round 1: Pleased to meet you</h2> <p>To greet a peer, the custom in much of the world is to shake hands. Unfortunately, Trump has a highly idiosyncratic handshake that is often visibly uncomfortable for the other person. And it\u2019s not just his handshake. But let\u2019s go to the tapes.</p> <h2><strong>May</strong></h2> <p><strong>What happened:</strong> They held hands.</p> <p><strong>Tell me more:</strong> Walking in the West Wing colonnade alongside May, Trump grabbed her hand and held it for awhile before patting it twice and letting it go. She kept a poker face. An anonymous White House source <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/28/revealed-real-reason-donald-trump-theresa-may-held-hands-not/\">spread</a> the word afterward that Trump, 70, is afraid of slopes and stairs and that the pair had to walk down a slope, so he reached out for her. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/27/theresa-may-donald-trump-hand-holding\">others suggested</a> it just looked like he grabbed her because he could.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2017/jan/27/trump-may-hold-hands-white-house-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5z5hm\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"3133723\"            data-video-name=\"Donald Trump and Theresa May awkwardly hold hands at White House \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters / AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-588bb0ebe4b0b3e971af38e1\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2017/01/27/170127TrumpMayHandhold_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2017/01/27/170127TrumpMayHandhold.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2017/01/27/170127TrumpMayHandhold_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2017/jan/27/trump-may-hold-hands-white-house-video\">Donald Trump and Theresa May awkwardly hold hands at White House</a></figcaption> </figure>   <h2><strong>Abe</strong></h2> <p><strong>What happened:</strong> They shook hands for 19 seconds.</p> <p><strong>Tell me more:</strong> Posing for photographers in the Oval Office, Trump and Abe locked hands and then seemed incapable of unlocking. The awkwardness escalated when Trump asked Abe what the Japanese photographers were saying. \u201cLook at me,\u201d Abe replied. So then Trump gazed at Abe. When it ended, Abe turned away with a traumatized grimace, gripping his chair and bobbing his hips. Then Trump told Abe he had \u201cstrong hands\u201d and pretended to grip a golf club.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWbP8eC-SIw\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GWbP8eC-SIw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2><strong>Trudeau</strong></h2> <p><strong>What happened:</strong> Trudeau beat Trump at his own game.</p> <p><strong>Tell me more:</strong> Like some kind of Canadian Superman, Trudeau proved impervious to the handshaking tricks \u2013 yanking the arm, patting the hand \u2013 that Trump uses to subdue mere mortals. Further asserting his self-possession, Trudeau allowed himself a disdainful glance at Trump\u2019s outstretched hand in the Oval Office before he accepted it. (You don\u2019t leave your largest trading partner wholly hanging.)</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2017/feb/14/donald-trumps-strange-handshake-style-and-how-justin-trudeau-beat-it-video-explainer\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/6v8ph\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"3195170\"            data-video-name=\"Donald Trump's strange handshake style and how Justin Trudeau beat it \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58a2716de4b09b65848eb59f\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2017/02/14/170214TrumpshakeUPDATE_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2017/02/14/170214TrumpshakeUPDATE.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2017/02/14/170214TrumpshakeUPDATE_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2017/feb/14/donald-trumps-strange-handshake-style-and-how-justin-trudeau-beat-it-video-explainer\">Donald Trump\u2019s strange handshake style and how Justin Trudeau beat it</a></figcaption> </figure>   <h2><strong>Netanyahu</strong></h2> <p><strong>What happened:</strong> The awkwardest reception.</p> <p><strong>Tell me more:</strong> When Benjamin and Sara Netanyahu emerged from their limo at the White House, Donald and Melania Trump greeted them with a friendly chat \u2026 that seemed like it would never end. There was a lot of fumbling with arms and hands and elbows and shoulders, as if none of the group had ever attempted conversation with more than one other person before. Then they stood for a picture \u2013 with the Trumps in the middle, as if <em>they</em> were the guests. Then, after more fumbling, Trump randomly returned a guard\u2019s frozen salute and the foursome disappeared inside. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4o_Z6X6ask\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/b4o_Z6X6ask?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2>Kenny</h2> <p><strong>What happened: </strong>Trump was seemingly the only man in the room not wearing a bright green tie and a shrubbery pocket square in honor of St Patrick\u2019s day. Then it got meta.</p> <p><strong>Tell me more:</strong> Somebody didn\u2019t get the memo about the shrubbery thing, apparently. In Trump\u2019s defense, Kenny\u2019s visit fell a day before the actual holiday. In the Oval Office, Kenny actually cracked a joke about Trump\u2019s handshaking style. \u201cYou can see nobody pulled anybody else,\u201d Kenny said. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve been getting a little heat for that,\u201d Trump replied, incredulously. Not from us, Mr President. Then Trump said: \u201cI love Ireland. I love it. I really love Ireland.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQvh71U8iL4\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aQvh71U8iL4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2>Winner</h2> <p>And the award for best handling of Trump goes to \u2026 <strong>Trudeau</strong>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/shortcuts/2017/feb/15/pictures-of-swooning-ivanka-trump-and-justin-trudeau-go-viral\">Especially if Ivanka Trump were one of the judges</a>.<br></p> <h2>Round 2: The press conference</h2> <p>The joint news conference can be a delicate pas de deux, in which world leaders standing side by side strive to show mutual deference while speaking to their distinct national audiences. It must be said for Trump that, so far, he is better at these than he is at anything that involves touching. </p> <h2><strong>May</strong></h2> <p><strong>What happened:</strong> Trump patronized May a bit, telling her that Brexit \u201cwas going to be a wonderful thing for your country\u201d. May smiled and prayed silently for a trade deal.</p> <p><strong>Tell me more:</strong> There was some built-in suspense for this one, for the American audience, because it was Trump\u2019s first official appearance on the global stage as president. Would he observe basic protocol? Would he allow May to speak? Would he mock her British accent? Would he make a dumb 1776 joke?</p> <p>In the end, it went OK. Trump said: \u201cA free and independent Britain is a blessing to the world, and our relationship has never been stronger.\u201d May said Trump had vowed 100% support for Nato, which for Trump counted as news. </p> <p>But at times, Trump seemed to be talking down to May. \u201cI think the prime minister, first of all, has other things that she\u2019s much more worried about than Mexico and the United States relationship,\u201d Trump said when May was asked about that issue. </p> <p></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2017/jan/27/may-president-trump-nato-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5z53p\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"3133348\"            data-video-name=\"Theresa May says Trump fully supports Nato \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-588b9693e4b0b3e971af384e\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2017/01/27/170127HighlightsMayTrump_KP-32257234_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2017/01/27/170127HighlightsMayTrump_KP-32257234.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2017/01/27/170127HighlightsMayTrump_KP-32257234_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2017/jan/27/may-president-trump-nato-video\">Theresa May says Trump fully supports Nato</a></figcaption> </figure>   <h2>Abe</h2> <p><strong>What happened:</strong> Trump was not equipped with a translation earpiece but seemed to pretend to understand Abe speaking Japanese.</p> <p><strong>Tell me more:</strong> Trump spoke first. Then Abe smiled, took out his translation earpiece and began speaking in his native language. Trump, without inserting his own earpiece, nodded along and appeared to listen intently to Abe\u2019s remarks. A White House spokeswoman later explained that Trump \u201cdid see the text and they spoke quite extensively before the remarks\u201d.</p> <p>Did it constitute an international incident? No. Did it reinforce the idea that Trump is in way over his head and desperately bluffing at every turn? That\u2019s not for us to say.

          "bodyText": "What sort of fireworks might erupt when the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, meets Donald Trump for the first time at the White House on Friday? If visits by foreign leaders to the White House so far are any guide, it will be \u2026 awkward, and perhaps embarrassing. The British prime minister, Theresa May, has the distinction of being the first foreign leader to have visited Trump, with Shinz\u014d Abe of Japan, Justin Trudeau of Canada, Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and Enda Kenny of Ireland following closely at her heels. Each of those trips was uncomfortable in its own unique way, but the visits did share a basic format. Merkel can expect to undergo a meet-and-greet with Trump in the Oval Office, with a photo opportunity; a private bilateral meeting with Trump; and, finally, a joint news conference. (Abe, like Trump an avid golfer, went in for the premium package, spending the whole weekend with the first family at Mar-a-Lago, the president\u2019s private Florida resort. Kenny, by contrast, got the basic package, which included a luncheon but not a news conference.) For a closer look at what Merkel might be in for, we\u2019ve broken down the previous trips by foreign leaders to the White House round by round. And we\u2019ve declared a winner for each round, based on who handled Trump best. Round 1: Pleased to meet you To greet a peer, the custom in much of the world is to shake hands. Unfortunately, Trump has a highly idiosyncratic handshake that is often visibly uncomfortable for the other person. And it\u2019s not just his handshake. But let\u2019s go to the tapes. May What happened: They held hands. Tell me more: Walking in the West Wing colonnade alongside May, Trump grabbed her hand and held it for awhile before patting it twice and letting it go. She kept a poker face. An anonymous White House source spread the word afterward that Trump, 70, is afraid of slopes and stairs and that the pair had to walk down a slope, so he reached out for her. But others suggested it just looked like he grabbed her because he could. Abe What happened: They shook hands for 19 seconds. Tell me more: Posing for photographers in the Oval Office, Trump and Abe locked hands and then seemed incapable of unlocking. The awkwardness escalated when Trump asked Abe what the Japanese photographers were saying. \u201cLook at me,\u201d Abe replied. So then Trump gazed at Abe. When it ended, Abe turned away with a traumatized grimace, gripping his chair and bobbing his hips. Then Trump told Abe he had \u201cstrong hands\u201d and pretended to grip a golf club. Trudeau What happened: Trudeau beat Trump at his own game. Tell me more: Like some kind of Canadian Superman, Trudeau proved impervious to the handshaking tricks \u2013 yanking the arm, patting the hand \u2013 that Trump uses to subdue mere mortals. Further asserting his self-possession, Trudeau allowed himself a disdainful glance at Trump\u2019s outstretched hand in the Oval Office before he accepted it. (You don\u2019t leave your largest trading partner wholly hanging.) Netanyahu What happened: The awkwardest reception. Tell me more: When Benjamin and Sara Netanyahu emerged from their limo at the White House, Donald and Melania Trump greeted them with a friendly chat \u2026 that seemed like it would never end. There was a lot of fumbling with arms and hands and elbows and shoulders, as if none of the group had ever attempted conversation with more than one other person before. Then they stood for a picture \u2013 with the Trumps in the middle, as if they were the guests. Then, after more fumbling, Trump randomly returned a guard\u2019s frozen salute and the foursome disappeared inside. Kenny What happened: Trump was seemingly the only man in the room not wearing a bright green tie and a shrubbery pocket square in honor of St Patrick\u2019s day. Then it got meta. Tell me more: Somebody didn\u2019t get the memo about the shrubbery thing, apparently. In Trump\u2019s defense, Kenny\u2019s visit fell a day before the actual holiday. In the Oval Office, Kenny actually cracked a joke about Trump\u2019s handshaking style. \u201cYou can see nobody pulled anybody else,\u201d Kenny said. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve been getting a little heat for that,\u201d Trump replied, incredulously. Not from us, Mr President. Then Trump said: \u201cI love Ireland. I love it. I really love Ireland.\u201d Winner And the award for best handling of Trump goes to \u2026 Trudeau. Especially if Ivanka Trump were one of the judges. Round 2: The press conference The joint news conference can be a delicate pas de deux, in which world leaders standing side by side strive to show mutual deference while speaking to their distinct national audiences. It must be said for Trump that, so far, he is better at these than he is at anything that involves touching. May What happened: Trump patronized May a bit, telling her that Brexit \u201cwas going to be a wonderful thing for your country\u201d. May smiled and prayed silently for a trade deal. Tell me more: There was some built-in suspense for this one, for the American audience, because it was Trump\u2019s first official appearance on the global stage as president. Would he observe basic protocol? Would he allow May to speak? Would he mock her British accent? Would he make a dumb 1776 joke? In the end, it went OK. Trump said: \u201cA free and independent Britain is a blessing to the world, and our relationship has never been stronger.\u201d May said Trump had vowed 100% support for Nato, which for Trump counted as news. But at times, Trump seemed to be talking down to May. \u201cI think the prime minister, first of all, has other things that she\u2019s much more worried about than Mexico and the United States relationship,\u201d Trump said when May was asked about that issue. Abe What happened: Trump was not equipped with a translation earpiece but seemed to pretend to understand Abe speaking Japanese. Tell me more: Trump spoke first. Then Abe smiled, took out his translation earpiece and began speaking in his native language. Trump, without inserting his own earpiece, nodded along and appeared to listen intently to Abe\u2019s remarks. A White House spokeswoman later explained that Trump \u201cdid see the text and they spoke quite extensively before the remarks\u201d. Did it constitute an international incident? No. Did it reinforce the idea that Trump is in way over his head and desperately bluffing at every turn? That\u2019s not for us to say. Trump did put a small speaker to his right ear during the subsequent question-and-answer session with journalists, some of whom were from Japan. Trudeau What happened: The Canadian prime minister barely suppressed a smile in the process of extruding diplomatic language on the subject of his counterpart\u2019s wild talk on refugees and immigration. Tell me more: Trump thinks Syrian refugees are secret terrorists, while Trudeau literally hugs them, a Toronto Star journalist pointed out. Would they care to comment? \u201cThere have been times when we have differed in our approaches, and that\u2019s always done firmly and respectfully,\u201d Trudeau replied, when suddenly the right side of his face tried to break into a smile of sympathy, discomfort or perhaps disbelief. \u201cThe last thing Canadians expect is for me to come down and lecture another country on how they choose to govern themselves,\u201d he finished, somberly. Trump did not smile. While the US\u2019s trade relationship with Canada was generally good, he said, \u201cwe\u2019ll be tweakin\u2019 it\u201d. Netanyahu What happened: Trump jettisoned longstanding US support for a two-state solution in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Tell me more: Netanyahu in general ran circles around Trump, at one point turning Trump\u2019s request for Israel to stop settlement construction into a joke. \u201cHe\u2019s a good negotiator,\u201d Trump said, as the crowd laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s the art of the deal!\u201d Netanyahu quipped. Good times. Asked about the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, Trump gave a vacuous and poorly improvised reply. \u201cI\u2019m looking at two-state, and one-state,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I like the one that both parties like. I\u2019m very happy with the one that both parties like. I could live with either one. I thought for a while the two-state looked like it may be the easier of the two, but honestly, if Bibi and the Palestinians, if Israel and the Palestinians are happy, I\u2019m happy with the one they like the best.\u201d Then Trump said of a US embassy in Jerusalem: \u201cI\u2019d love to see that happen.\u201d Kenny What happened: There wasn\u2019t a news conference, but there was a luncheon. Tell me more: Trump bravely pronounced \u201ctaoiseach\u201d and called Kenny \u201cmy new friend\u201d. Then he praised the contributions of Irish immigrants to the United States. He mentioned that John F Kennedy had once been US president. And he said: \u201cI\u2019ve spent a lot of time at St Patrick\u2019s Day parades over the years, I will tell you that.\u201d Winner And the award for best handling of Trump goes to \u2026 Netanyahu. In his first visit, he seemingly had the new American president dropping a two-decade-old commitment to the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel. Round 3: The art of the deal This is the round that happens behind closed doors, in private meetings between the parties. There are no transcripts and, from the US side at least, scant official description of what was discussed. One way to gauge how it went is from the coverage of the leaders\u2019 trips in the media back home. Here\u2019s how some of that coverage looked. May What happened: May was criticized for not confronting Trump over refugees and over his travel ban. Tell me more: After meeting Trump, May claimed to have laid \u201cthe foundations of a trade deal\u201d. But the opposition leader, Jeremy Corbyn, accused her of failing to defend British citizens affected by the travel ban and failing to stand up for refugees, women and other groups Trump has attacked. May said she \u201cmade very clear\u201d that Trump\u2019s travel ban on was \u201cdivisive and wrong\u201d. Abe What happened: Trump gave Abe the deluxe dignitary treatment, golfing with him, sending Melania Trump out into the public eye with Akie Abe, and even troubleshooting an international incident with the Japanese prime minister on the terrace at Mar-a-Lago. Tell me more: During his campaign, Trump accused Japan of dumping goods on the United States, of manipulating its currency and of not paying a fair share for its defense. But face-to-face with Abe, those criticisms disappeared, to be replaced by praise from Trump for Japan\u2019s \u201cheavy\u201d investment in mutual defense and a commitment to \u201cbringing those ties even closer\u201d, as well as personal compliments from Trump to Abe and his wife \u2013 \u201ca wonderful couple!\u201d To cap the trip, the two leaders spent a cozy weekend together at Mar-a-Lago, where a provocative North Korean missile launch \u201cwas played out by candlelight against a backdrop of hotel muzak, high-paying guests and low-paid waiters\u201d, the Guardian\u2019s Julian Borger wrote. Abe appears to have harvested a popularity bump from the trip, with a Kyodo News poll finding that 70.2% were satisfied with the Abe-Trump talks, while only 19.5% were dissatisfied. Trudeau What happened: Trudeau was praised for his restraint. Tell me more: \u201cAccording to a senior government source, there was some acknowledgment in private of the two leaders\u2019 differing perspectives on immigration,\u201d a CBC columnist wrote afterwards. \u201cBut the president is said to think highly of Canada\u2019s points-based system for selecting immigrants.\u201d The Globe and Mail columnist Andrew Cohen called it a \u201cgood, successful first date\u201d and praised Trudeau\u2019s \u201cbravura performance\u201d: However tempted, you say nothing about global warming \u2026 At the same time, you do not lecture your host on Muslim refugees, Mexican immigrants, the value of the UN \u2013 or, frankly, any of your values. Canada, which can be smug, has done that sort of thing before. It never works well. At the end of the day, you do what you have to do to keep our biggest customer happy. Mr. Trudeau did. It was a bravura performance. Netanyahu What happened: Netanyahu\u2019s rapport with Trump was contrasted favorably with the prime minister\u2019s lack of rapport with Obama. Tell me more: While Haaretz noted that the Trump-Netanyahu meeting was loaded with \u201cignorance, internal contradictions, political sloganeering and more than a few disagreements\u201d, most coverage back home of the prime minister\u2019s trip noted the palpable warmth between Netanyahu and Trump, who have known each other since the 1980s. \u201cTrump greeted Netanyahu as an old and dear friend, hosting him in Blair House, and lauding him as a smart and good leader,\u201d the Jerusalem Post effused. \u201cThe tone was markedly different from the acrimony that always seemed to follow Netanyahu\u2019s meetings with former US president Barack Obama.\u201d Kenny What happened: Kenny won positive coverage back home for asking Trump to pay special consideration to Irish immigrants. Tell me more: The Irish Times reported that Kenny \u201csaid he had raised both the issue of legal immigration paths for Irish people, including the revival of a stalled proposal of a new E3 visa scheme, as well as the situation of undocumented Irish citizens living in the United States\u201d: He said the president had been surprised at the number of undocumented Irish living in the country - said to be 50,000 - and had expected it to be much higher. The Guardian quoted Kenny as telling Trump that undocumented Irish immigrants just want to \u201cmake America great\u201d, adding: We would like this to be sorted. It would remove a burden of so many people that they can stand out in the light and say, now I am free to contribute to America as I know I can. And that\u2019s what people want. Winner And the award for best handling of Trump goes to \u2026 Abe. On his watch, Trump was transformed from hostile critic to praiseful host. Then they went golfing. Next up: Merkel",

The surging force in rightwing politics is a form of ethno-populism, driven by heightened concerns over immigration and terrorism. When the right adopts the far-right\u2019s language and policies, the only victory is for the hardliners. Supping with the devil can mean you enter the room as a guest and end up as dessert. Look at France, where Marine Le Pen could end up in the second round of the presidential election leading a party with no significant presence in the National Assembly. She would then have a chance to peel off members of the centre-right Republican party by offering the premiership and other ministerial posts in her putative government.</p> <p>Power is enormously seductive. Just ask Donald Trump. He first upended the US Republican establishment and now sits atop it. In the White House Trump models himself on America\u2019s first populist president, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/03/16/donald-trump-paying-homage-andrew-jackson-comparisons/\" title=\"\">Andrew Jackson</a>. Jacksonian America is a paranoid place: under siege, with its values undermined either by an elite cabal or by immigrants and its future under threat by arms of government that oppress voters rather than protect them. Even US neoconservatives, who thought they were advancing a liberal agenda through war, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/02/28/george-w-bush-paints-dark-picture-of-america-under-trump-i-dont-like-the-racism/?utm_term=.17371b631829\" title=\"\">recoil from the noxious racism</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If recent history is any guide, trying to ignore rightwing populists and the issues they raise does not work</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Trump, Wilders and Le Pen are all part of a pitchfork rebellion on the right. It is a historically novel conservative movement. Margaret Thatcher would never have attacked the British intelligence services, nor would Ronald Reagan have traduced the family of a US soldier killed in action.</p> <p>If recent history is any guide, trying to ignore rightwing populists and the issues they raise does not work. The policy flip-flops over immigration while Ed Miliband was leading Labour revealed to voters a vacillating streak over an issue that was rising to the top of their concerns; the party lost ground. The Dutch Labour party in this election <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/so-much-migration-puts-europes-dykes-in-danger-of-bursting-8772630.html\" title=\"\">framed their anti-migration arguments</a> as protecting workers \u2013 but the party\u2019s real problem was that it was in coalition with the centre-right government until 2014 and pushed through painful cuts to pensions and healthcare. <a href=\"http://www.politico.eu/article/dutch-labor-party-exits-stage-left-dutch-elections-lodewijk-asscher/\" title=\"\">Voters have not forgiven it</a>.</p> <p>What is lacking here is context. Technology has helped populists frame their messages to appear more in tune with the zeitgeist than established political parties, at a time when globalization has made many feel insecure about their position in society.</p> <p>Political parties, and the system of representative government, grew out of a more restrained politics, where voters decided which package of policies they wanted. With the rise of social media and single-issue campaigning, parties lost their monopoly on information. This at a time when people are more and more interested in single issues, causes and individual campaigns. These lend themselves to rightwing demagoguery, which trades in unsubstantiated claims.</p> <p>The change in politics is happening as poorer workers see their governments not bothering to prevent wages from sinking or to prevent jobs from being exported. Ahead of them are white-collar workers, who are frightened of being downsized themselves and are wary of paying taxes to provide benefits for anyone else.</p> <p>In the Netherlands, which appears a competitive and productive economy,<a href=\"https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2016/06/16/2166258/why-is-the-netherlands-doing-so-badly/\" title=\"\"> real household consumption is still lower than a decade ago</a>. Only last year, the <a href=\"https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2016/07/09/tijd-voor-een-nieuw-sociaal-contract-3162415-a1509927\" title=\"\">head of the government\u2019s thinktank said prosperity was not being widely shared</a> and a yawning gap was opening up between old and young, white and non-white, as well as lowly qualified and highly qualified people. Kim Putters of the Dutch Social and Cultural Planning Office warned people were being left powerless and sought control over their lives. Sound familiar?</p> <p>This is the bumpy terrain over which the populist tweeters \u2013 including Le Pen, Wilders and Trump \u2013 ride. They play on the idea that the system has failed and once elected only they will deal with \u201cproblems\u201d: the non-whites, non-Christians and other cultural deviants along with the smug bureaucrats, lawyers and professors. Populist movements want to overturn constitutional governments so that the groups they define as enemies of the people can be targeted. That\u2019s why they need to be confronted. That\u2019s why the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/15/dutch-elections-greenleft-jesse-klaver\" title=\"\">progressive success story of the Dutch elections was the Green Left party</a>, whose leader Jesse Klaver preached the virtues of an open, fair society: \u201cstand for your principles,\u201d he told voters. \u201cBe straight. Be pro-refugee. Be pro-European\u201d. With 14 seats, he can play kingmaker in coalition talks.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-netherlands-election-klaver-idUSKBN16H27K\" title=\"\">Klaver, the 30-year-old son of an absentee Moroccan father and part-Indonesian mother</a>, was canny enough to use social media and rallies to build support, but his breakthrough was largely down to the fact he was the anti-Wilders candidate. Klaver, who looks like Canada\u2019s Justin Trudeau and sounds like America\u2019s Bernie Sanders, sold an optimistic vision of tolerance, equality and environmentalism, through a slick, web-driven campaign strategy. His message to Wilders: \u201cI want my country back\u201d. He was given to slapping bigots down, saying he had had enough of hate. In TV debates he told Wilders that Islam wasn\u2019t the problem in Holland, Wilders was. Klaver\u2019s right: the way to take on the far-right is not to imitate racists but to fight them.</p>",

He\u2019s been happy to play the tough guy \u2013 as prime minister in the last week of the election campaign Rutte burnished his populist credentials through a fractious dispute with Turkey. He calculated it was in the interests of the Dutch prime minister to be tough on Turkey, and in the interests of the Turkish president to be tough on the Netherlands. He happily sparked a mini-international crisis for the sake of votes. Rutte said stopping Wilders was about stopping the \u201cwrong sort of populism\u201d. The Dutch prime minister will learn that he can\u2019t run the rhetoric of reaction; it will end up running him. Dealing with the populists who deal in fear offers three options: ignore, co-opt or confront. The surging force in rightwing politics is a form of ethno-populism, driven by heightened concerns over immigration and terrorism. When the right adopts the far-right\u2019s language and policies, the only victory is for the hardliners. Supping with the devil can mean you enter the room as a guest and end up as dessert. Look at France, where Marine Le Pen could end up in the second round of the presidential election leading a party with no significant presence in the National Assembly. She would then have a chance to peel off members of the centre-right Republican party by offering the premiership and other ministerial posts in her putative government. Power is enormously seductive. Just ask Donald Trump. He first upended the US Republican establishment and now sits atop it. In the White House Trump models himself on America\u2019s first populist president, Andrew Jackson. Jacksonian America is a paranoid place: under siege, with its values undermined either by an elite cabal or by immigrants and its future under threat by arms of government that oppress voters rather than protect them. Even US neoconservatives, who thought they were advancing a liberal agenda through war, recoil from the noxious racism. Trump, Wilders and Le Pen are all part of a pitchfork rebellion on the right. It is a historically novel conservative movement. Margaret Thatcher would never have attacked the British intelligence services, nor would Ronald Reagan have traduced the family of a US soldier killed in action. If recent history is any guide, trying to ignore rightwing populists and the issues they raise does not work. The policy flip-flops over immigration while Ed Miliband was leading Labour revealed to voters a vacillating streak over an issue that was rising to the top of their concerns; the party lost ground. The Dutch Labour party in this election framed their anti-migration arguments as protecting workers \u2013 but the party\u2019s real problem was that it was in coalition with the centre-right government until 2014 and pushed through painful cuts to pensions and healthcare. Voters have not forgiven it. What is lacking here is context. Technology has helped populists frame their messages to appear more in tune with the zeitgeist than established political parties, at a time when globalization has made many feel insecure about their position in society. Political parties, and the system of representative government, grew out of a more restrained politics, where voters decided which package of policies they wanted. With the rise of social media and single-issue campaigning, parties lost their monopoly on information. This at a time when people are more and more interested in single issues, causes and individual campaigns. These lend themselves to rightwing demagoguery, which trades in unsubstantiated claims. The change in politics is happening as poorer workers see their governments not bothering to prevent wages from sinking or to prevent jobs from being exported. Ahead of them are white-collar workers, who are frightened of being downsized themselves and are wary of paying taxes to provide benefits for anyone else. In the Netherlands, which appears a competitive and productive economy, real household consumption is still lower than a decade ago. Only last year, the head of the government\u2019s thinktank said prosperity was not being widely shared and a yawning gap was opening up between old and young, white and non-white, as well as lowly qualified and highly qualified people. Kim Putters of the Dutch Social and Cultural Planning Office warned people were being left powerless and sought control over their lives. Sound familiar? This is the bumpy terrain over which the populist tweeters \u2013 including Le Pen, Wilders and Trump \u2013 ride. They play on the idea that the system has failed and once elected only they will deal with \u201cproblems\u201d: the non-whites, non-Christians and other cultural deviants along with the smug bureaucrats, lawyers and professors. Populist movements want to overturn constitutional governments so that the groups they define as enemies of the people can be targeted. That\u2019s why they need to be confronted. That\u2019s why the progressive success story of the Dutch elections was the Green Left party, whose leader Jesse Klaver preached the virtues of an open, fair society: \u201cstand for your principles,\u201d he told voters. \u201cBe straight. Be pro-refugee. Be pro-European\u201d. With 14 seats, he can play kingmaker in coalition talks. Klaver, the 30-year-old son of an absentee Moroccan father and part-Indonesian mother, was canny enough to use social media and rallies to build support, but his breakthrough was largely down to the fact he was the anti-Wilders candidate. Klaver, who looks like Canada\u2019s Justin Trudeau and sounds like America\u2019s Bernie Sanders, sold an optimistic vision of tolerance, equality and environmentalism, through a slick, web-driven campaign strategy. His message to Wilders: \u201cI want my country back\u201d. He was given to slapping bigots down, saying he had had enough of hate. In TV debates he told Wilders that Islam wasn\u2019t the problem in Holland, Wilders was. Klaver\u2019s right: the way to take on the far-right is not to imitate racists but to fight them.",

          "bodyText": "It\u2019s the story of a remote Canadian town that \u2013 at a moment when the world was gripped by fear of terrorism \u2013 put aside fear-mongering and welcomed thousands of strangers from abroad. Come from Away is a Broadway musical about the small town of Gander, Newfoundland, which took in 6,579 passengers after US airspace was closed. On Wednesday, the show\u2019s audience included Justin Trudeau, Canada\u2019s prime minister, and Ivanka Trump, who arrived shortly after a federal court in Hawaii ordered a nationwide halt on the Trump administration\u2019s proposed ban on travellers from several Muslim-majority countries. The irony that the president\u2019s daughter should take in a show on welcoming foreigners \u2013 even as her father fights to bar millions from entering the US \u2013 was not lost on many. \u201cToday is a weird day for Ivanka to be at something called We Come from Away,\u201d one person wrote on Twitter. The \u201cday her daddy\u2019s Muslim ban got shot down again, she saw a show about welcoming strangers,\u201d noted another. Canadian officials had invited some 600 people to the show, including Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the United Nations, and more than 100 other UN ambassadors as well as politicians from both sides of the border. The surprise pairing of Trump and Trudeau at the show was \u201crich with symbolism\u201d, the New York Times noted. The storyline showcases the bonds forged as residents opened their doors to strangers from more than 100 countries, including a Muslim man who was initially treated with hostility and suspicion after he was heard speaking Arabic on the phone and a gay couple worried about how the seemingly conservative community would see them. As Ivanka Trump watched the musical, her father was leading a raucous rally in Nashville, slamming the court ruling as an \u201cunprecedented judicial overreach\u201d and vowing to fight back. Still, some held hope that the show\u2019s message might help sway the president\u2019s daughter, who has become a key adviser to the Trump team. In a tweet directed at Trudeau and the cast of the show, one Twitter user wrote: \u201cThank you for showing Ivanka what it means to be Canadian (&amp; what it used to mean to be American!)\u201d Another added: \u201cHopefully its message resonated with the audience (Read:Ivanka).\u201d",

          "bodyText": "With almost all the results in and coalition talks likely to take months we\u2019re going to bring this blog to a close. Here\u2019s a summary: The results The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, has seen off a challenge from the anti-Islam anti-EU populist Geert Wilders to claim victory in parliamentary elections. Rutte said his victory halted resurgent nationalism, claiming \u201cThe Netherlands said \u2018Stop\u2019 to the wrong sort of populism.\u201d Coalition talks on forming a new government have begun in the Hague but could take months to finalise. Rutte\u2019s party looks likely to take 33 seats (a loss of eight MPs) and will need the support of at least three other parties to secure the 76 seats needed to govern. The Christian Democrats (centre to centre-right) and Democrats 66 (economic: centre-right, social: centre-left), each with an expected 19 MPs, are two of the obvious candidates. Wilders, despite a projected second-place finish overall with around 20 seats, is not likely to be part of those negotiations, with all major parties unwilling to work with his populist, anti-Islam MPs. Wilders said he was proud that his PVV had gained seats to come second in the poll only 12 years after it was founded. The Labour party or PvdA, slumped from 38 seats to a projected nine. Labour leader Lodewijk Asscher admitted the result was \u201cunbelievably disappointing\u201d and that voters had put their trust in another party \u2013 an apparent reference to GreenLeft. The unexpected victor of the night was GreenLeft, led by 30-year-old Jesse Klaver, which boosted its four seats to a projected 14. It could now play kingmaker in coalition talks. The official tally of results will be published on 21 March. The reaction The political establishment in Europe welcomed the Dutch result as victory for tolerance and a boost for the European Union after its battering from last year\u2019s Brexit vote. European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said it was victory \u201cfree and tolerant societies in a prosperous Europe.\u201d German Chancellor Angela Merkel described it a \u201cvery pro-European result\u201d and a \u201cgood day for democracy\u201d. In France, where the anti EU far right Marine Le Pen is leading in the presidential election polls, there was also relief from the political establishment. French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, said it was a \u201cclear victory against extremism\u201d. But Nicolas Bay, secretary general of Le Pen\u2019s Front National said he was encouraged by the gains for Wilders. Guy Verhofstadt, leader of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe in the European Parliament, said: \u201cPeople want constructive and reliable politicians to govern their country. This is why Le Pen will also fail.\u201d Spain\u2019s Conservative prime minister Mariano Rajoy congratulated the Dutch people for their \u201cresponsibility\u201d. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 hit a new record high at the start of trading and European shares hit their highest level in 15 months. Turkey said there is \u201cno difference\u201d between the ruling Dutch liberals and the \u201cfascist\u201d anti-immigration politician Geert Wilders. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, who was barred by Netherlands from speaking at rally in support of giving Turkish President Erdo\u011fan, extra powers, said: \u201cYou look at the social democrats and the fascist Wilders, there is no difference, they have the same mentality.\u201d Hanna Yusuf has been monitoring how Dutch TV has been crunching the numbers. This FT graphic neatly sums up the result and the collapse in the Labour party vote. The Guardian\u2019s communities team is looking for readers reaction to the Dutch poll. Party leaders have come together in The Hague for the beginning of coalition talks, writes Hanna Yusuf. Speaking on his way to the talks D66 leader Alexander Pechtold said that he is incredibly proud of the election results, and that he is keeping an open mind when it comes to forming a government. The CDA are having cake because they claim they have something to celebrate. The party leader, Buma, said: \u201cthis is the best campaign we have ever had\u201d, according to the Dutch news site NOS. The Labour party had a less festive mood. Asscher said that he will keep going, and try to rebuild. Merkel: \u2018very pro-European result\u2019 German Chancellor Angela Merkel has welcomed what she describes as a \u201cvery pro-European result\u201d and a \u201cgood day for democracy\u201d Speaking at a conference on demography, she said: \u201cThe Netherlands are our partners, friends, neighbours. Therefore I was very happy that a high turnout led to a very pro-European result, a clear signal. \u201cAnd that after days in which the Netherlands had to tolerate accusations and reproaches from Turkey which are totally unacceptable... It was a good day for democracy.\u201d European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker has hailed the Dutch election result as a vote for \u201cfree and tolerant societies in a prosperous Europe.\u201d In a letter to Rutte he said the result would be as an \u201cinspiration for many\u201d a veiled reference perhaps to forthcoming elections in France and Germany. He didn\u2019t mention anti-EU and anti-immigrant Geert Wilders but Junckers is clearly relieved that he was beaten into second. Writing in Dutch Junckers added: \u201cLet us put our heads together for a stronger Europe.\u201d Here\u2019s a graphic of latest results. Denis MacShane Britain\u2019s former Minister of Europe under Labour, has hailed the result as the end of populism in Europe. Writing in the Independent he says: The Dutch result and the probable new President of France signals an end to Brexit-Trump nationalist populism with its nasty anti-immigrant scapegoating. Such politics will not disappear and it will infect mainstream parties, much as Ukip has now transplanted itself into the Conservative Party and even the cabinet. But democracies are not yet ready to surrender to their extremes. He also says the result should be a warning to Britain\u2019s Labour party. The Dutch centre-left party shares the same name as Labour but it slumped from 33 to 9 seats. Its leader, Lodowijk Aascher, tried to turn his fire on European workers in the Netherlands much as many Labour MPs have produced plans to limit Europeans working in the UK with proposals for Cold War era work permits, regional quotas, passports for London, and other schemes for external control that are archaic, bureaucratic and unenforceable short of a complete shutdown of entry into Britain. Far better would be stronger internal controls of the UK labour market to promote local employment, training, and protection of workers. But so traumatised is post-Brexit Labour that the party has lost clarity of thought. Labour MPs quoted approvingly the PvdA\u2019s Aascher as he sought to scapegoat European workers in the Netherlands, but Dutch voters are not buying left nationalist populism. Guy Verhofstadt, leader of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe in the European Parliament, has welcomed the Dutch result and claims it shows why Marine Le Pen will not be elected president in France. \u201cPeople want constructive and reliable politicians to govern their country. This is why Le Pen will also fail,\u201d he tweeted. With 95% of votes counted here\u2019s Jon Henley\u2019s latest roundup of the results. The German broadcaster Deutsche Welle has a useful video roundup of the reaction from seven leaders of the main party in the Netherlands (with subtitles). All but one claim the result as some kind of victory. The exception is Labour Party leader Lodewijk Asscher who admitted the result was \u201cunbelievably disappointing\u201d and that voters had put their trust in another party \u2013 an apparent reference to GreenLeft. The Labour Party or PvdA fell from 35 seats to just nine. Britain\u2019s Green Party is buoyed by the performance of the GreenLeft which came from nowhere to a projected 14 seats. Joint Green Party leader Jonathan Bartley sees this as a good omen. But Rafael Behr warns us to beware of Brits drawing too many conclusions from the Dutch results. Turkey said there is \u201cno difference\u201d between the ruling Dutch liberals and the \u201cfascist\u201d anti-immigration politician Geert Wilders, after Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte defeated the far-right in elections, AFP reports. \u201cYou look at the social democrats and the fascist Wilders, there is no difference, they have the same mentality,\u201d Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said acording to state-run news agency Anadolu. The comments follow Turkey\u2019s suspension of diplomatic relations with the Netherlands on Monday and Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan twice describing the Dutch government as Nazis on Saturday after Cavusoglu and Turkey\u2019s family affairs minister were prevented from attending rallies. Earlier this week Rutte accused Erdo\u011fan, of escalating the row after holding the Netherlands responsible for Srebrenica massacre. Party leaders are expected to meet this afternoon to discuss the first steps of coalition horse trading. Ruling coalitions need at least 76 seats between them. Rutte\u2019s VVD is well short of that with 33 seats, so will need the support of at least three other parties. The Christian Democrats and centrist D66 parties are likely future coalition partners with 19 seats each. But which other party could join? Rutte has ruled out working with Wilders\u2019 PVD which came second with 20 seats. Coalition talks are likely to take months and may not succeed. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has hit a new record high at the start of trading and European shares hit their highest level in 15 months on the back of the Dutch election results. The result may not be a surprise in Holland, but there has been lots of soul searching from the international media after its over-emphasis on the far right leader Geert Wilders and its underplaying of the collapse of the establishment left party the PvdA. The secretary general of France\u2019s far-right Front National said he was encouraged by the gains for Geert Wilders. \u201cIt\u2019s a real success,\u201d secretary general Nicolas Bay told France Inter radio, referring to how Wilders\u2019 party had won more seats, despite losing the overall result to Dutch centre-right prime minister Mark Rutte. There is widespread relief among British MPs at the result. Senior figures from all the main parties have welcomed the failure of Geert Wilders to top the poll. European government bonds are strengthening this morning, following Geert Wilder\u2019s failure to claim first place in the Dutch election. French debt is in demand, as investors take it as a sign that Marine Le Pen might be thwarted in her bid to win the presidency. Business Live has more on the market reaction: Spain\u2019s Conservative prime minister Mariano Rajoy has joined the queue of European leaders congratulating Rutte and the Dutch people for their \u201cresponsibility\u201d. He also praised the centre right CDA which looks set to come joint third with 19 seats. The prime minister of Denmark, Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen has congratulated Rutte and hailed the Dutch election result as a victory for serious politics. He is the latest European leader to welcome the result. Earlier French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, said it was a \u201cclear victory against extremism\u201d. Prime minister Mark Rutte has praised the Dutch for not allowing the Netherlands to fall to the \u201cwrong side of populism\u201d. Speaking to Bloomberg after a victory party he said: After Brexit, after the US elections, the [Dutch] people have said no to another country where the domino stone of the wrong side of populism would topple over. Geert Wilders is putting a brave face on coming second. He tweeted that he is proud of the more than one million people who voted for his Party of Freedom (PVV). Here\u2019s a rough translation via Bing: Very proud of all our voters, more than 1 million Dutch citizens! Thanks! 12 years after establishment, PVV the second party of all! Great!! This is Matthew Weaver taking over from Claire Phipps. The results VVD, the centre-right party led by incumbent prime minister Mark Rutte, has emerged as the biggest party, knocking back the predicted surge of Geert Wilders\u2019 far-right PVV. Rutte\u2019s party looks likely to take 33 seats (a loss of eight MPs) and will \u2013 as expected and is typical for the 150-seat Dutch parliament \u2013 need to enter into coalition talks to form a new government. Wilders, despite a projected second-place finish overall with around 20 seats, is not likely to be part of those negotiations, with all major parties unwilling to work with his populist, anti-Islam MPs. The collapse of Rutte\u2019s former coalition partners, the social democratic PvdA, slumping from 38 seats to a projected nine, means the PM will need to seek new agreements. The Christian Democrats (centre to centre-right) and Democrats 66 (economic: centre-right, social: centre-left), each with an expected 19 MPs, are the obvious candidates. But the unexpected victor of the night was GreenLeft, led by 30-year-old Jesse Klaver, which boosted its four seats to a projected 14. It could now play kingmaker in coalition talks. Talks are likely to last for some time \u2013 possibly weeks or months. The official tally of results will be published on 21 March. The reaction Rutte hailed the win, saying it was the moment in which The Netherlands said \u2018Stop\u2019 to the wrong sort of populism. Wilders called Rutte\u2019s remarks very worrying, as if populists are semi-Nazis \u2026 If all the losers like the VVD form a government, we need to have a strong opposition of winners like the PVV. The result was welcomed in Europe with German chancellor Angela Merkel telling Rutte: I look forward to working with you as friends, neighbours and Europeans. French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande congratulated Rutte: The values of openness, respect for others, and a faith in Europe\u2019s future are the only true response to the nationalist impulses and isolationism that are shaking the world. And this was GreenLeft\u2019s response to its electoral surge: The collapse of the Dutch Labour party PvdA \u2013 on course to fall from 38 seats to just nine \u2013 means its role as coalition partner to VVD is under threat. Leader Lodewijk Asscher\u200f has reportedly said he sees no role for his shrunken party in new coalition talks, which are likely instead to involve the Christian Democrats and Democrats 66, with a possible role for GreenLeft too. Asscher called the result \u201ca blow\u201d: (My rudimentary translation: \u201cTo all who supported us, thank you for your trust. The outcome is a blow, but the future of social democracy is worth fighting for.\u201d) Here are those latest figures; about 95% of the vote has been counted now, but the final official numbers are not published until 21 March. Nonetheless this is a pretty good guide to the way the new parliament will look: NRC: Rutte can do it \u2013 but with whom? Algemeen Dagblad: Rutte again BN DeStem: Rutte keeps smiling De Volkskrant: Rutte keeps populists down An editorial in respected Dutch daily NRC says the Netherlands has woken up to a \u201cnormal\u201d morning: The Dutch have woken up in a \u201cnormal\u201d country, as prime minister Mark Rutte puts it: there was no populist revolt. Rutte\u2019s VVD lost a quarter of its support but thanks to its substantial lead over the other parties finds itself in an exceptionally comfortable position as leader. The PvdA, however, one of the pillars of the postwar welfare state, is in existential crisis. Never in parliamentary history has a party lost so many seats. What is clear is that governing does not pay. The outgoing government presented a dream budget this year: what should have gone up went up, what should have come down came down. The Netherlands is currently one of the best performing countries in the EU. And still voters punished the outgoing coalition severely. For the voter, apparently, politics is about more than the economy. The Dutch news agency ANP has said its final results forecast, usually published sometime on election night, is unlikely to be available until later on Thursday or even on Friday. That\u2019s because several large municipalities including Amsterdam, The Hague and Utrecht don\u2019t expect to finish counting until then. But the ANP\u2019s election chief, Mark Westerhoff, said he expected no further significant changes to the picture. With 93.3% of votes counted, that was: VVD 33 seats PVV 20 CDA and D66 19 each GroenLinks, SP 14 PvdA 9 ChristenUnie and Partij voor de Dieren 5 each 50PLUS 4 SGP and DENK 3 Forum for Democracy 2 Some happy campaigners in The Hague: Writing for RTL Z, Roderick Veelo cautions against assumptions that the populist far-right is over: Responsibility \u2013 the willingness to steer the country through difficult times \u2013 seems to be the Achilles heel of the PVV [Geert Wilders\u2019 Freedom party] \u2026 Wilders\u2019 lack of responsibility broke into the campaign on the final weekend with the diplomatic row with Turkey. With perhaps the most energetic move of his career, Rutte put Wilders in checkmate. Rutte showed courage and leadership in a very difficult matter of national importance, and for potential PVV voters became a better choice than Wilders \u2026 Rutte is still standing, but so too is the social discontent about uncontrolled immigration, failed integration and the power of Brussels. This dissatisfaction is not going away. The broad coalition that will govern this country soon must show responsibility and courage on these subjects and go to work with real solutions. Only when that happens will the populist revolt die a quiet death. The Dutch election result has had a buoying effect on the euro, Reuters reports: The euro stood tall on Thursday after Dutch election exit polls pointed to a comfortable win by the prime minister over his far-right rival. The euro climbed to a five-week high of $1.0746 on Thursday, after surging 1.2 percent overnight. The common currency was boosted as exit polls showed the Netherlands\u2019 centre-right prime minister Mark Rutte roundly saw off a challenge by anti-Islam, anti-EU Geert Wilders in an election on Wednesday, alleviating concerns towards Holland opting to leave the EU. \u201cThe euro\u2019s rise was an initial reaction to the Dutch exit polls and the currency could rise further when the European \u2018mother market\u2019 comes into session later in the day,\u201d said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo. \u201cHow much further support the euro can garner would depend on how the Dutch vote could now impact the French presidential elections, for example by eroding support for [Marine] Le Pen. We could see the euro gain further if spreads between French and German government bonds tighten today.\u201d Voting continues swiftly \u2013 we\u2019re now into single-digit percentages still to tot up. It\u2019s a three-way race for second place, but VVD is unassailable in first. The big winner \u2013 and now the largest party of the Dutch left for the first time \u2013 was GreenLeft, headed by 30-year-old Jesse Klaver, hailed by his enthusiastic supporters as the \u201cJessiah\u201d. The party \u2013 formed 25 years ago by a merger of communists, pacifists, evangelicals and self-styled radicals \u2013 looks set to quadruple its MPs from four to 16 after a storming campaign by Klaver. \u201cThis is a fantastic result for us, a historic victory,\u201d said the party chairwoman, Marjolein Meijer. The result showed there was \u201cvery fertile ground in the Netherlands for change and a positive and hopeful story\u201d, she said. \u201cFor us this is just the beginning.\u201d The Netherlands\u2019 youngest ever party leader, Klaver built a strong following on social media through small Meetup events after taking over GreenLeft\u2019s leadership in May 2015. His rallies were among the campaign\u2019s largest, including an Amsterdam meeting that drew more than 5,000 people \u2013 plus 5,000 more following live on Facebook. His TV debates were also widely regarded as triumphs. In one debate watched by 1.6 million viewers, Klaver told his far-right, anti-Islam rival Geert Wilders that it was rightwing populism, not Muslim immigration, that was undermining Dutch culture and traditions. \u201cThe values the Netherlands stands for \u2013 for many, many decades, centuries actually \u2013 its freedom, its tolerance, its empathy \u2026 [the populists] are destroying it,\u201d he said during one campaign interview. \u201cIt\u2019s terrible when people are born in the Netherlands have the feeling they are not part of this society and it is not something to be proud of, but something to be ashamed of. And I want to change that.\u201d Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte says the election result, in which his VVD party comfortably beat the anti-Islam Freedom party of Geert Wilders, shows the people have said no to \u201cthe wrong side of populism\u201d. As the leader of the party with the greatest vote share, Mark Rutte will be given the first chance to form a government. He\u2019s likely to need three other parties to join with his VVD party to get the 76-seat majority needed in the 150-seat parliament. Predictions based on votes counted so far and exit polls put VVD on an estimated 31 seats. With the Christian Democrats and Democrats 66 looking set for 19 seats each, they are obvious first ports of call for Rutte. But that could add up to just 69 seats, still short of a majority. Geert Wilders, whose Freedom party (PVV) is also on course for 19 MPs, is not expected to be drawn into negotiations, despite announcing his willingness overnight. All major parties have said they would not work with the far-right party. Rutte\u2019s coalition partner till now, the social democratic Labour party (PvdA), has had a disastrous election, predicted to slump from 38 seats to just nine. Into the gap could come GreenLeft and its young leader Jesse Klaver. With a projected 16 seats, the party could become kingmaker in the new parliament. But don\u2019t expect a speedy settling: talks on forming a coalition could take months. It\u2019s notable that the social democratic Labour party (PvdA), Rutte\u2019s outgoing coalition partner, has nosedived off the bottom of the listing. It\u2019s currently forecast to slump to a historic low of nine seats from 38 in the current parliament. The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, and his liberal VVD party appear to have comfortably beaten the anti-Islam Freedom party of Geert Wilders to become the largest in the new parliament. \u201cOur message to the Netherlands \u2013 that we will hold our course, and keep this country safe, stable and prosperous, got through,\u201d Rutte told a cheering crowd of supporters at the VVD\u2019s election night party. The eyes of Europe had been on the vote, he added. \u201cMany European colleagues have called me this evening: this was an evening when after Brexit and Trump, the Netherlands said \u2018Stop\u2019 to the wrong sort of populism.\u201d Wilders tweeted that since the VVD had lost seats and the PVV had gained, his party was \u201camong the winners\u201d, adding: \u201cIf all the losers like the VVD form a government, we need to have a strong opposition of winners like the PVV.\u201d The leftwing environmentalists of GreenLeft looked the big winners of the night, as the party was forecast to quadruple its number of MPs to 16. But the social democratic Labour party (PvdA), Rutte\u2019s outgoing coalition partner, was forecast to slump to a historic low of nine seats from 38 in the current parliament. The projected result would leave Rutte with a choice of coalition options, although coalition-building \u2013 with four parties likely to be needed \u2013 could take months: the average in the Netherlands is three months and the record more than 200 days. Margaritis Schinas, spokesperson for the EU commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, says Juncker has spoken to the Netherlands\u2019 incumbent PM, Mark Rutte, congratulating him on his \u201cclear victory\u201d: A vote for Europe, a vote against extremists. With 50% of votes counted, here\u2019s how it stands, with VVD still holding a convincing lead: French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande is congratulating Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte for his election success and his \u201cclear victory against extremism\u201d, Associated Press reports: After Rutte\u2019s party soundly beat the party of anti-immigrant populist Geert Wilders, Hollande said in a statement early Thursday: The values of openness, respect for others, and a faith in Europe\u2019s future are the only true response to the nationalist impulses and isolationism that are shaking the world.\u201d France is facing a presidential election starting next month in which far-right leader Marine Le Pen, who wants to leave the European Union and sharply curb immigration, is expected to make a strong showing. Both Rutte and Wilders had painted Wednesday\u2019s Dutch election as a battle between established politics and populist ideas. French foreign minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said the result was good for a \u201cstronger Europe\u201d: Geert Wilders has left the building: Geert Wilders \u2013 whose far-right PVV has not performed as well as he, or polls, expected \u2013 has said he would be willing to enter coalition talks. (All main parties have said they will not go into coalition with PVV, and it currently doesn\u2019t look as if the first-placed VVD will need Wilders.) With 28% of votes counted, here\u2019s how the projection of seats won stands: VVD 32 seats Christian Democrats 20 PVV (Wilders\u2019 Freedom party) 19 Democrats 66 18 GreenLeft 14 SP 14 PvdA (Labour) 10 The Dutch poll differed from Trump\u2019s election and the Brexit referendum. Those were one-on-one, winner-take-all contests for which the victor needed 50% \u2013 or in the US poll, very nearly 50% \u2013 of the vote. The result in the Netherlands was always going to be a coalition of at least four, possibly five, parties that will take months to form and have to govern by compromise and consensus. And all main parties had vowed not to work with Wilders. So even if Geert Wilders\u2019 PVV had ended up as the largest party, it would almost certainly have been locked out of government. Even if it had not been, in order to pass new legislation it would have needed, as well as the lower house, the Dutch senate on board \u2013 where it currently has nine out of 75 seats. Wilders may prompt comparisons with Trump and Brexit \u2013 in hairstyle, campaign slogan (\u201cTake our country back\u201d), presentation and predilection for Twitter \u2013 but it was never clear how much of his programme he could have implemented in practice. Nor were the Dutch likely to vote to leave the EU any time soon. The prospect of a \u201cNexit\u201d referendum had gained currency abroad, but the other parties would not have backed it and there is no evidence a majority of voters would either. The far right in France and Germany would, certainly, have hailed a Wilders win as a nativist, anti-establishment triumph. But despite loudly welcoming both Brexit and Trump as the beginning of a \u201cpatriotic revolution\u201d, the Front National in France and AfD in Germany saw no improvement in their polling afterwards. This projection of seats won, courtesy of Die Zeit and not a final tally, puts Rutte\u2019s VVD on 33 seats, with the Christian Democrats in second place. Wilders\u2019 PVV shares third spot with Democrats 66 \u2013 but PVV is unlikely to be part of any coalition negotiations, with all major parties pledging not to work with the far-right party. Before coalition negotiations begin on Thursday morning, incumbent PM \u2013 and likely next PM \u2013 Mark Rutte has some other business to attend to: teaching. This visual shows the shift in voting in Amsterdam, where GreenLeft (GL) has surged to become the biggest winner \u2013 and Labour (PvdA) the biggest loser: I\u2019ve been speaking to supporters of GroenLinks (Green-Left), who quadrupled their MPs from four to 16. The party\u2019s charismatic leader is being hailed as \u201cJessiah\u201d, with similarities to Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau. They are realistic, instead of optimistic like the other left-wing parties I hope their plans to raise the taxes for cars but lower the cost of public transport \u2013 as well as make it more accessible \u2013 happen. Also, their plans to lower the cost of university and increase financial aid. And the use of alternative energy sources. Jesse Klaver is trustworthy, young and dynamic. They are rather realistic, instead of optimistic like the other left-wing parties. \u2013 Eva,18, foreign language student in France, with Dutch nationality I hope they can make sure we keep investing in foreign aid I hope they make sure the next government invests more into renewable energy, that we keep investing in foreign aid, which is much more effective in dealing with the refugee problem than closing the borders. I have mixed feelings about Klaver. Yes, he is a new impulse and he has a nice story to tell \u2013 young, son of a Moroccan father, worked hard \u2013 but it feels like he is using this story a bit too much. He is trying a bit too hard to be the new Dutch Obama or Trudeau. \u2013 Stef, 21, university student, Tilburg This election may determine whether we become the UK and US, or if we maintain our progressive values Groenlinks is one of the few parties with fresh ideas. It has a young face and stands for tolerance and European integration, which are the most important things to cling to in the current political climate. I want the Netherlands to be part of the EU, in which people live together in peace instead of spreading hate. Everyone is allowed to say what they want and believe what they want, up to the point where it insults other members of society. This election may determine whether we become the UK and US, or if we maintain our progressive values of tolerance and harmony. \u2013 Vlad, 19, student, living in Leiden Our reporter Gordon Darroch, in the Hague, has some totting-up of seats and possible coalitions: Negotiations to form a multi-party coalition to get that parliamentary majority will begin on Thursday and could continue for some time. This is Claire Phipps picking up the live blog as it ticks over into Thursday in the Netherlands. We have results from Amsterdam, where GreenLeft has come out on top: I\u2019m handing over this liveblog to my colleague Claire Phipps now, who will keep you posted with live results and reaction from the 2017 Dutch election as we get them. Thanks for reading and being with us tonight. Or as GreenLeft might put it: German chancellor Angela Merkel has congratulated Mark Rutte on his party\u2019s strong showing in the 2017 election in a telephone conversation. According to Merkel spokesman Steffen Seibert, she said: I look forward to working with you as friends, neighbours and Europeans. Jon Henley has this piece from the night on the surprise gains for the GreenLeft. The big winner of Wednesday\u2019s Dutch election \u2013 and now the largest party of the left for the first time \u2013 was GreenLeft, headed by 30-year-old Jesse Klaver, hailed by his enthusiastic supporters as the \u201cJessiah\u201d. According to a generally reliable Ipsos exit poll, the party, formed 25 years ago by a merger of communists, pacifists, evangelicals and self-styled radicals, quadrupled its MPs from four to 16 after a storming campaign by Klaver. \u201cThis is a fantastic result for us, a historic victory,\u201d said the GreenLeft chairwoman, Marjolein Meijer. The result showed there was \u201cvery fertile ground in the Netherlands for change and a positive and hopeful story,\u201d she said. \u201cFor us this is just the start.\u201d The party celebrated its historic advance with a tweet showing a gif of Kermit the Frog dancing for joy. Dutch TV station RTV Rijnmond is reporting that PVV is the largest party in Rotterdam, the Netherlands\u2019 second biggest city. Geert Wilders has tweeted in response: Mark Rutte has spoken following the exit polls which put his party in pole position. Here\u2019s a loose translation of his speech: It seems like for the third time in a row the VVD is the Netherlands biggest party. Our message to the Netherlands \u2013 that we will hold our course, and keep this country safe and stable \u2013 got though. I have had lots of European colleagues on the line. This is an evening where the Netherlands, after Brexit and Trump, said: \u201cThat\u2019s enough of the wrong sort of populism.\u201d He called the high turnout \u201ca festival of democracy\u201d. We also discovered his favourite song is Bruno Mars\u2019 Uptown Funk, which is my take-home fact of the night. Author Rutger Bregman has pointed out that parties that are concerned with environmental issues doubled their number of seats from 15% to 31%. Kathalijne Buitenweg, the chair of the GreenLeft delegation in the European parliament, has commented on the party\u2019s gains. We\u2019ve never had such great results \u2013 we quadrupled our seats \u2013 and I am incredibly proud of the party and all the people who voted and campaigned. It\u2019s clear people have had enough of the current climate of polarisation, and want a message of positivity and I am proud of that. Journalist Gordon Darroch has been reporting on the reaction of Socialist leader Emile Roemer, whose party lost one seat. As Darroch puts it: \u201cRoemer doesn\u2019t sound like a man who plans on stepping down in the morning.\u201d And the prize for best reaction to tonight\u2019s exit poll from the Dutch election surely come from leftwing insurgents GreenLeft. It posted this pretty excellent gif of Kermit the Frog when the provisional results came through. Jon Henley points out that the leftwing environmentalist party was set to be the big winners of the night, quadrupling its number of MPs to 16 Prime minister Mark Rutte and his liberal VVD party appear to have comfortably beaten the populist, anti-Islam Freedom party of Geert Wilders to become the largest in the new Dutch parliament, an early exit poll suggested. In the first of three key European votes this year in which populist parties are seeking electoral breakthroughs, the VVD lost ten seats but was still on course for 31 seats in the 150-seat parliament, the Ipsos poll for Dutch broadcasters predicted. Three other parties \u2013 the centre-right Christian Democrats (CDA), liberal-progressive D66 and Wilders\u2019 PVV \u2013 were forecast to gain between four and seven seats each, all finishing with 19 MPs each. The leftwing environmentalists of GreenLeft were set to be the big winners of the night, quadrupling their number of MPs to 16, the poll suggested, but the social democratic PvdA, Rutte\u2019s outgoing coalition partners, appeared to have slumped to a historic low of nine seats from 38 in the current parliament. Labour leader Lodewijk Asscher has called the party\u2019s apparent decimation a \u201cbitter evening\u201d and congratulated Jesse Klaver of GreenLeft. He says the party led the country out of an economic crisis, but it had failed to convince supporters to vote for it again. Carmen Fishwick asked Dutch voters why some people in the country, which is renowned for its liberal and tolerant culture, are drawn to Wilders\u2019 party. People need anything that shows that the government cares Other political parties don\u2019t offer any answer for the fears or problems that many Dutch feel they are facing. I personally don\u2019t believe these problems are as big as perceived by many others. But then again, I have the luxury of being at a distance. If other parties would offer, for example, an approach against groups of youths showing disrespectful behaviour, they could lure away a lot of PVV voters. It\u2019s not that hard: more money for 24/7 police surveillance and social work, for example. People need anything that shows that the government cares. \u2013 Lisa, 43, project manager living in Amsterdam If you are far-right, you only have one real option Geert Wilders is the only major party willing to quit the EU and ban Islam. If you are far-right, you only have one real option. Many people feel like they have lost something due to neoliberal policies, as well as the country being more ethnically and culturally diverse. Not everything has been perfect with the assimilation of groups perceived as migrants even though the majority are well-functioning and hard-working. For many it\u2019s not that its bad at this very moment, it\u2019s the feeling that if it goes on there will be enormous problems. Wilders is a walking middle finger, an outcry of despair. \u2013 Imre Rossel, 19, Gouda Supporters say that if you\u2019re against Wilders you\u2019re pro-Islam I know a lot of people who will vote for him. They\u2019re afraid of the Islam and refugees who take their money, supposedly. People say that if you\u2019re against Wilders you\u2019re pro-Islam or something. But I don\u2019t think he will be the biggest party because many people are going to vote for the Christian Democrats. Their leader said some really nationalistic things and profiles himself really as a right-wing party. \u2013 Rens Verhaegh, 22, Nijmegen Polling suggests that the high-profile spat between the Netherlands and Turkey \u2013 which saw Turkish ministers prevented from addressing rallies of Dutch Turks ahead of a referendum on granting Turkey\u2019s president sweeping new powers \u2013 may have helped incumbent prime minister Mark Rutte. Of those polled who said they voted VVD 34% said the Turkey crisis had played a role. Perhaps more importantly, 81% chose Rutte for his handling of the economy. (See \u201cWhat are the issues\u201d in this piece. ) This from Jon Henley and Gordon Darroch\u2019s piece: In a campaign dominated by Wilders\u2019 core themes of immigration and integration, the row has \u201callowed Rutte to show himself as a statesman \u2013 and to send a Turkish minister packing\u201d, said Andr\u00e9 Krouwel, a political scientist at Amsterdam\u2019s Free University \u201cWhat better publicity could a politician want a few days before an election?\u201d Klouwer said. \u201cRutte was able to show he could actually expel Turks, and to tell Wilders: \u2018You\u2019re just sitting there, tweeting\u2019 \u2026 This has won Rutte the election.\u201d A playful jibe at the unprecedented global interest in the 2017 Dutch election: Geert Wilders has thanked PVV voters following the exit poll, which appears to show that while his party gained seats it will fall far short of the 30 seats that polls were predicting he could gain at the start of the year. A (loose) translation: We have won seats! That\u2019s the first victory! I\u2019m not done with Rutte yet! But according to journalist Robert Chesal, the PVV is the only political party not holding a post-election gathering. Whichever politicians the Dutch have chosen today, they have turned out in large numbers to vote. The elections saw the highest turnout in the past 31 years, with 82% of people going out to vote, according to Ipsos. Dutch media outlet NOS is reporting that the exit poll could mean that the Labour party, one of the country\u2019s largest has lost a record number of seats. The numbers would see the PvdA, which was in a coalition government with the Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD), go from 38 seats to nine seats. That\u2019s an unprecedented loss in Dutch politics. The leftwing party performed worse than it did in the 2002 election, in which it went from 45 seats to 23. Some analysis of what those results would mean, if the main exit poll is accurate: Rutte\u2019s centre-right VVD Party looks set to win 31 out of 150 seats. That is significantly ahead of the next three parties \u2013 Geert Wilders\u2019 anti-immigration Freedom Party (PVV), the Christian Democrat Party and the liberal party. Each of these are set to get 19 seats, according to the exit poll. The Labour party (PvdA) appears to be the biggest losers of the night, and could lose as many as 29 seats. The biggest winner appears to be Green Left, the left-wing Green party which looks to have gained 12 seats. So what does this mean for a future Dutch coalition? Journalist Naomi O\u2019Leary says there is no clear coalition of the right, while the left have been left in disarray. Former leader of the social liberal Democrats 66 (D66) Lousewies van der Laan argues that if this exit poll is accurate Rutte can remain as prime minister. If this exit poll is accurate this shows a disappointing night for Wilders\u2019 PVV; it\u2019s also a devastating night for the Labour party, who are heading for a record low. The first exit polls are in for the Dutch elections. They show Rutte\u2019s VVD party on 31 seats, while Geert Wilders\u2019s PVV is on 19, the same as the CDA and D66. Obviously all exit polls have to be approached with a health warning, but if these are accurate it appears that the centrist VVD will emerge as the largest party. My colleague Hanna Yusuf, a Dutch speaker who spent part of her childhood in the Netherlands, has produced this handy guide to some of the bigger political parties: People\u2019s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) Political position: centre-right party Leader: Mark Rutte (current PM) Notes: currently in power in a coalition government with the PvdA The Labour Party (PvdA) Political position: centre-left Leader: Lodewijk Ascher Notes: currently in office in a coalition government with the VVD Party for Freedom (PVV) Political position: right-wing to far-right Leader: Geert Wilders Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) Political position: centre to centre-right Leader: Sybrand van Haersma Buma The Green Party (GroenLinks) Position: centre-left Leader: Jesse Klaver Democrats 66 (D66) Position: Centre (economic: centre-right, social: centre-left) Leader: Alexander Pechtold Socialist Party (SP) Position: Left-wing Leader: Emile Roemer Christian Union (CU) Position: centre to centre-right Leader: Gert-Jan Segers 50 Plus (50+) Position: centre Leader: Henk Krol Party for the Animals (PvdD) Position: left-wing Leader: Marianne Thieme Reformed Political Party (SGP) Position: right-wing Leader: Kees van der Staaij Loth as I am to big up other media organisations\u2019 coverage of the Dutch elections, if you finish reading everything the Guardian has to offer (I doubt this will happen, but just in case), here are a few bits that are worth a read/listen. Simon Kuper, of the Financial Times, who grew up in the Netherlands, writes that Wilders \u201cdoesn\u2019t worry the Dutch\u201d. Wilders\u2019 views on asylum seekers, immigration and the EU influence the national debate. But polls show that the biggest issue for voters is \u201czorg\u201d \u2014 which means both healthcare and eldercare. People are also worried about public rudeness and misbehaviour. Long technocratic TV debates on these topics draw big audiences. All this is deeply tedious for foreigners. Even if Wilders finishes first on March 15, expect months of boring coalition talks, culminating in a government without Wilders. Then foreigners can forget about Dutch politics for another decade. He also wrote a rather lovely piece from the Netherlands\u2019 poorest village. There is also a really interesting Radio 4 documentary in which journalist Tim Whewell asks, \u201cWhy is liberal, tolerant Netherlands home to one of Europe\u2019s most successful anti-immigration, anti-Islamic parties?\u201d Here\u2019s the blurb: Unlike some far-right parties elsewhere in Europe, the PVV has no neo-Nazi roots. It\u2019s loud in its support for gay and women\u2019s rights. It promotes itself as a strong defender of Holland\u2019s Jewish community. Is its ideology just an opportunistic mishmash? Or does it make some sense in a Dutch context? Searching for Henk and Ingrid, Tim Whewell sets off through Dutch \u201cflyover country\u201d - the totally un-photogenic satellite towns and modern villages that tourists, and Holland\u2019s own elite, rarely see. He asks if the PVV\u2019s platform is just thinly disguised racism. Or has it raised important questions about immigration and multiculturalism that other European countries, including the UK, have been scared to ask? Polls are set to close in about twenty minutes at 9pm local time (8pm GMT), and we\u2019ll get the first exit poll soon after. According to Mudde: \u201cTraditionally, exit polls have been pretty accurate in the Netherlands.\u201d Turnout so far looks to be up to 73%, up from 65% in 2012 and just shy of the 75% who turned out in 2006. Whether this will help or hinder Wilders appears to be up for debate: But our man in The Hague, Jon Henley, points out that most analysts believe a high turnout will benefit the left and centre parties. A high turnout in big cities such as Amsterdam is \u201cparticularly bad news for Wilders\u201d, he says. That point is reiterated by political scientist Cas Mudde: A little word on timings: Polls close at 9pm local time (8pm GMT). We expect the first exit poll at about 8.o5pm GMT and then a more accurate exit poll roughly 30 minutes later at 8.30pm GMT Results will start to come in from some of the small islands quite quickly, but the big cities like Amsterdam and Rotterdam won\u2019t declare until after 11pm GMT. We should have a clearer idea of where things are by midnight GMT. Will polls fare any better in this election than in recent votes in the UK and the US? For what it\u2019s worth here are the most recent polling predictions from the latest Peilingwijzer poll of polls by Leiden University. They show the centrist People\u2019s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) slightly in the lead. Nonetheless, the extent of Geert Wilders\u2019s popularity will be seen as a barometer of both populist and anti-immigration sentiment in Europe. Here is a profile of the agitator-in-chief from Gordon Darroch: Geert Wilders founded his Party for Freedom (PVV) in 2006 with a declaration of independence from the \u201celite in The Hague\u201d, and from the outset has espoused anti-Muslim rhetoric, promising to enshrine the \u201cdominance of the Judeo-Christian tradition\u201d in the Dutch constitution. As the country prepares to vote in national elections on 15 March, opinion polls have at times suggested that Wilders\u2019 party could emerge as the country\u2019s largest, despite recent slips. The strength of the anti-Islam, anti-EU populist PVV is reverberating around the country. He is thought unlikely to enter government but in his decade agitating in Dutch politics, Wilders\u2019s influence has changed the tone of debate in the country. He draws predictable comparisons with Donald Trump, but the similarities are mainly in style: a taste for sharp suits, incandescent hair dye and inflammatory tweets. While Trump rode into Washington as an outsider, Wilders has spent 19 years in parliament and is fighting his fourth election as party leader. This piece about what the Dutch election is \u2013 and is not \u2013 about is also excellent, and explains why the Dutch are not \u201cdoing a Brexit\u201d, or indeed \u201ca Trump\u201d, this evening. This is a key point from Cas Mudde: 3 The Dutch are not electing a president International media style the Dutch elections as a \u201cneck-and-neck race\u201d between conservative prime minister Mark Rutte of the People\u2019s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) and radical-right challenger Wilders, to fit the broader frame of status quo versus populism. [...] But however convenient it is for selling newspapers or for Rutte, this formula is inconsistent with the essence of the elections. The Dutch are electing a parliament, not a president or premier, and it is not guaranteed that the leader of the biggest party will be the premier. In a parliamentary system the government needs the support of the parliamentary majority, not necessarily of the biggest party. Moreover, the struggle between Rutte and Wilders captures only a minority of the voters: together the VVD and PVV are only polling between 30 and 35%. In other words, the real story is somewhere else. This is a fascinating vote, which has garnered an unprecedented amount of interest in the Dutch political system. Whether you are coming to it fresh, or are a seasoned Netherlands\u2019 politico, we have a comprehensive range of stories explaining the significance of today\u2019s election. A great starting place is this thorough preview from the inimitable Jon Henley, who is on the ground in The Hague. What\u2019s the political landscape and how does the system work? There are 150 MPs in the Dutch parliament, meaning a government needs 76 seats to form a majority. No single party ever manages this and the Netherlands has been governed by coalitions for more than a century. Parliament is elected by proportional representation in a single, nationwide constituency \u2013 which means that any party that wins 0.67% of the national vote is assured of a seat (key facts about the Dutch electoral system here). Dutch politics have been marked in recent decades by a sharp decline in support for the three main parties of government from the centre-right and left. Their share of the vote has shrunk from more than 80% in the 1980s to a projected 40% this year. This is a trend visible across Europe; see more about it here. In the Netherlands, it has been paralleled by a proliferation of smaller special interest parties: no fewer than 28 of them, many new, are contesting this election. As many as 14 are forecast to win seats, including eight with 10 or more MPs. It is this fragmentation of the vote, rather than a big increase in support, that could see the PVV become the largest party. The movements that produced Brexit and Trump won about half the vote; Wilders\u2019 is forecast to get below 20% (more from the Peilingwijzer poll aggregator here). Welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live blog of the 2017 Dutch elections \u2013 we\u2019ll be covering developments throughout the night and into tomorrow, bringing you live news from the Netherlands as it happens. With voters racing to polling stations before they close at 9pm local time (8pm GMT), all eyes are on the small European nation as the world waits to see if another populist insurgent can cause further political upset in Europe, or if the rising tide of populism can be stemmed. Early indications show that the turnout in 2017 is higher than the last election in 2012. According to local media reports 43% of voters went to the polls by 2.45pm GMT compared with 37% in 2012. Why do we care about this election? It\u2019s the first of three key European votes this year in which populist parties are hoping to match the success of Britain\u2019s leave campaign and the victory of Donald Trump in the United States. France will go to the polls to elect a new president next month, while a general election in Germany is due in September. The conservative prime minister, Mark Rutte, leader of the Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) is up against the far-right, anti-Islam populist Geert Wilders, leader of the Party for Freedom (PVV). Wilders has called for - among other things - the closing of mosques and Islamic schools, banning sales of the Qur\u2019an and barring Muslim migrants. Rutte has said the election is an opportunity for voters to \u201cbeat the wrong sort of populism\u201d. The VVD leads the latest Peilingwijzer poll of polls by Leiden University, on 17% - which could equate to about 24-28 seats - while Wilders\u2019 party is close behind on 14%, about 12-23. After recent elections, however, polls increasingly come with a fairly hefty health warning. Even if the PVV emerge as the country\u2019s largest party, it\u2019s unlikely Wilders will enter government. The other mainstream parties have already made it pretty clear they will not enter into a coalition with him. However, after shock results in the UK and the US, a strong showing for Wilders would further spook the Netherlands\u2019 European neighbours and send further shockwaves across the continent.",

          "body": "<p>A slight note of exasperation crept into Justin Trudeau\u2019s voice, suggesting that this was a topic he had broached many times before. \u201cI\u2019m going to keep saying loud and clearly that I am a feminist until it is met with a shrug,\u201d he declared to an audience at the United Nations in New York.</p> <p>His words sparked delight around the world. But one year on, Trudeau\u2019s heady promises have run into the realities of government, prompting the question: has electing a self-described feminist to helm the country translated into real change for Canadian women?</p> <p>The answer seems to be no \u2013 or at least, not yet.<br></p> <p>This month, Oxfam Canada released its first ever <a href=\"https://www.oxfam.ca/news/oxfam-scorecard-tracking-liberal-government-action-on-women%E2%80%99s-rights-shows-progress-%E2%80%93-but-more\">\u201cfeminist scorecard\u201d</a>, envisioned as a tool to track Trudeau\u2019s progress. The group concluded that some 17 months after taking power, the prime minister and his team\u2019s \u201cbold feminist rhetoric has not yet translated into tangible spending decisions\u201d.</p> <p>No one doubts that scale of the challenge: as many as 4,000 Indigenous women <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/17/missing-and-murdered-indigenous-women-in-canada-could-number-4000\">have gone missing or been murdered in the past three decades</a>, while the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/thunder-bay/aboriginal-women-now-make-up-one-third-of-canadian-female-prison-population-1.3089050\">number of Indigenous women</a> in prison has rocketed. Child care costs in the country <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/oecd-child-care-costs-1.3815954\">rank among the highest in the OECD</a>, and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/gender-pay-gap-a-persistent-issue-in-canada/article34210790/\">a persistent pay gap</a> has sent the country tumbling to 35th place in the World Economic Forum\u2019s global gender gap rankings.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>According to Oxfam, solid progress has been demonstrated in just one area: women\u2019s representation and leadership. \u201cYou can\u2019t overstate the importance of the first <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/04/canada-cabinet-gender-diversity-justin-trudeau\">gender-balanced cabinet in Canadian history</a>,\u201d said Lauren Ravon of Oxfam.<br></p> <p>The government fared worst in the category of jobs, where Oxfam noted that no actions have been taken to address a gender wage gap that ranks among the worst in the OECD or to ensure living wages for the working poor, the majority of whom are women. </p> <p>While the government has committed to tabling pay equity legislation for federally regulated sectors, <a href=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2016/10/05/liberals-to-compel-pay-equity-for-all-workers-in-federally-regulated-sectors.html\">it has said it will not do so until 2018</a>.<br></p> <p>Still, Oxfam was hopeful that the government would steadily improve its performance on the scorecard in the coming years. \u201cFor the most part we\u2019ve seen good first signs. Things are moving in the right direction,\u201d said Ravon. \u201cAs the Liberal government embarks on the second year of its mandate, it is time to turn feminist words into action.\u201d </p> <p>Among those who have been left waiting are Indigenous women and girls, said Pamela Palmater, who heads the centre for indigenous governance at Toronto\u2019s Ryerson University. Trudeau came into power vowing to overhaul the fraught relationship between Canada and its Indigenous people, rattling off promises that ranged from <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/editorials/the-undrip-drip-drip-of-liberal-native-rights-policy/article31807191/\">extending the right to self-determination</a> to making <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-election-2015-liberal-justin-trudeau-first-nations-1.3189872\">significant investments</a> in First Nation education.</p> <p>To date, little progress has been made. \u201cTrudeau is failing on literally every promise to Indigenous peoples generally and Indigenous women and girls specifically,\u201d said Palmater. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bed051d1de7b6b03d7b48975731284e4ef12f96a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bed051d1de7b6b03d7b48975731284e4ef12f96a/78_0_2150_1290/1000.jpg\" alt=\"justin trudeau\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Justin is practicing token feminism.

          "bodyText": "A slight note of exasperation crept into Justin Trudeau\u2019s voice, suggesting that this was a topic he had broached many times before. \u201cI\u2019m going to keep saying loud and clearly that I am a feminist until it is met with a shrug,\u201d he declared to an audience at the United Nations in New York. His words sparked delight around the world. But one year on, Trudeau\u2019s heady promises have run into the realities of government, prompting the question: has electing a self-described feminist to helm the country translated into real change for Canadian women? The answer seems to be no \u2013 or at least, not yet. This month, Oxfam Canada released its first ever \u201cfeminist scorecard\u201d, envisioned as a tool to track Trudeau\u2019s progress. The group concluded that some 17 months after taking power, the prime minister and his team\u2019s \u201cbold feminist rhetoric has not yet translated into tangible spending decisions\u201d. No one doubts that scale of the challenge: as many as 4,000 Indigenous women have gone missing or been murdered in the past three decades, while the number of Indigenous women in prison has rocketed. Child care costs in the country rank among the highest in the OECD, and a persistent pay gap has sent the country tumbling to 35th place in the World Economic Forum\u2019s global gender gap rankings. According to Oxfam, solid progress has been demonstrated in just one area: women\u2019s representation and leadership. \u201cYou can\u2019t overstate the importance of the first gender-balanced cabinet in Canadian history,\u201d said Lauren Ravon of Oxfam. The government fared worst in the category of jobs, where Oxfam noted that no actions have been taken to address a gender wage gap that ranks among the worst in the OECD or to ensure living wages for the working poor, the majority of whom are women. While the government has committed to tabling pay equity legislation for federally regulated sectors, it has said it will not do so until 2018. Still, Oxfam was hopeful that the government would steadily improve its performance on the scorecard in the coming years. \u201cFor the most part we\u2019ve seen good first signs. Things are moving in the right direction,\u201d said Ravon. \u201cAs the Liberal government embarks on the second year of its mandate, it is time to turn feminist words into action.\u201d Among those who have been left waiting are Indigenous women and girls, said Pamela Palmater, who heads the centre for indigenous governance at Toronto\u2019s Ryerson University. Trudeau came into power vowing to overhaul the fraught relationship between Canada and its Indigenous people, rattling off promises that ranged from extending the right to self-determination to making significant investments in First Nation education. To date, little progress has been made. \u201cTrudeau is failing on literally every promise to Indigenous peoples generally and Indigenous women and girls specifically,\u201d said Palmater. While the government did launch the long-awaited inquiry into the thousands of missing and murdered women in August, some seven months later the inquiry has yet to hold its first public hearing. \u201cJustin is practicing token feminism,\u201d said Palmater. \u201cHe made his cabinet half women, but these are women who are already privileged and in power. So, essentially, he shared some power around a small group of elites.\u201d Palmater is not the only skeptic: others have asked if Trudeau is a \u201cfake feminist\u201d and questioned the depth of his commitment to the idea. Many were incensed by Trudeau\u2019s launch of a roundtable on female entrepreneurs alongside Donald Trump last month. \u201cHow could the prime minister possibly sit down and discuss women in the workforce with President Trump without first denouncing his misogynist comments?\u201d Sheila Malcolmson, an MP with Canada\u2019s New Democratic party, asked in parliament. Her party has consistently pushed Trudeau on the issue of gender equality, putting forward a bill last year that would have forced parties to nominate a greater number of female candidates to parliament. Despite the fact that just 26% of the MPs elected in Canada\u2019s last election were women \u2013 a proportion that lags behind countries such as Uganda, Guyana and Laos \u2013 Trudeau\u2019s Liberals were among those who voted against the bill, citing now cancelled plans to reform the country\u2019s electoral system. For Sharmeen Khan of No One Is Illegal Toronto, Trudeau\u2019s reputation as a feminist has become an obstacle as the organisation attempts to draw attention to the government\u2019s continued use of policies that marginalise some of the country\u2019s most vulnerable, from temporary foreign workers to migrants without status. \u201cIt is incredibly frustrating,\u201d said Khan. \u201cIt\u2019s been really difficult for us to put heat on this government or pressure them because I feel people have been like, \u2018Why are you criticising this government?\u2019, even though the policies haven\u2019t changed since they got in.\u201d Some worry that might be exactly the point.

          "body": "<p>From a hilltop in Mas\u2019ade on the Israeli side of the Syrian border in the Golan Heights, Faried al-Said Ahmed surveys his cherry and apple trees 80 feet below. Barbed wire surrounds the steep hillside, preventing people entering a minefield planted when the Six-Day War ended 50 years ago.</p> <p>Currently, the trees are bare. Cherry-picking season is May and June, while 45,000 tons of apples will leave this co-operative farm after they ripen in September and October.</p> <p>Although Syrians are fighting less than three miles away and there\u2019s the danger of being blown up underfoot, Ahmed has a more pressing concern: the European Union.</p> <p>The co-operative sells fruit across Israel, but Ahmed claims that the EU\u2019s protection of its member states\u2019 farms makes exports to Europe all but impossible. \u201cIf it were possible to sell in England then, my God, yes, we would,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The 52-year-old may soon get his wish. When article 50 is triggered in the coming days, the UK will be only two years away from negotiating its own trade deals. The focus has been on an agreement with the US, but given the probable complications of negotiating with self-proclaimed master dealmaker Donald Trump, Israel might be first to sign on the dotted line.</p> <p>After talks in No 10 last month, Theresa May and Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, announced a joint working group charged with \u201cpreparing the ground\u201d for a trade deal.</p> <p>The trade relationship between Israel and Britain is already worth \u00a34.9bn, and on Wednesday foreign secretary Boris Johnson told press in Jerusalem as he stood beside Netanyahu: \u201cWe are ... building a global identity as a Britain that\u2019s coming out of the EU and we want to build on our trading partnership with you. We are the biggest European trading partner with Israel \u2026 We have the largest, fastest-growing Aston Martin dealership anywhere in the world here in Israel.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2195e593e98fb48e3ff6f0c11c6c4f3c6309a443\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2195e593e98fb48e3ff6f0c11c6c4f3c6309a443/0_0_3650_2190/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, visited the West Bank and Israel last week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The foreign secretary, Boris Johnson (centre), visits Israel and the West Bank last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ilia Yefimovich/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At his official residence on the outskirts of Tel Aviv, the British ambassador, David Quarrey, points to a growing economic relationship between the countries in the past 18 months. This included the biggest UK-Israel trade deal in history: Rolls-Royce landed a \u00a31bn contract to service and maintain its Trent 1000 engines for the airline El Al and, in the other direction, the Israeli defence firm Elbit Systems is in a consortium that provides the Ministry of Defence with training aircraft and simulators.</p> <p>Quarrey says: \u201cWe\u2019re seeing trading bilateral relationships between the UK and Israel, in science and trade for example, doing better than ever. But there\u2019s the potential to do even better, particularly in the context of Brexit. I was with Theresa May and Benjamin Netanyahu in London and it was clear there was the determination for this.</p> <p>\u201cMost businesspeople in Israel look at the UK as a great place to do business, because of its culture, language, and the predictability of the regulatory and tax systems.\u201d</p> <p>Britain, in effect, outsourced trade negotiations to European bureaucrats in the 1970s, so the way the newly formed Department for International Trade (DIT) thrashes out the Israel deal could provide a template for other business agreements.</p> <p>It is understood that the first meeting of the working group will take place by the end of this month. Two to four people will represent each side, including officials from the DIT and Israel\u2019s Ministry of Economy. They will set the parameters for future discussions, expected to take place two or three times a year.

          "bodyText": "From a hilltop in Mas\u2019ade on the Israeli side of the Syrian border in the Golan Heights, Faried al-Said Ahmed surveys his cherry and apple trees 80 feet below. Barbed wire surrounds the steep hillside, preventing people entering a minefield planted when the Six-Day War ended 50 years ago. Currently, the trees are bare. Cherry-picking season is May and June, while 45,000 tons of apples will leave this co-operative farm after they ripen in September and October. Although Syrians are fighting less than three miles away and there\u2019s the danger of being blown up underfoot, Ahmed has a more pressing concern: the European Union. The co-operative sells fruit across Israel, but Ahmed claims that the EU\u2019s protection of its member states\u2019 farms makes exports to Europe all but impossible. \u201cIf it were possible to sell in England then, my God, yes, we would,\u201d he says. The 52-year-old may soon get his wish. When article 50 is triggered in the coming days, the UK will be only two years away from negotiating its own trade deals. The focus has been on an agreement with the US, but given the probable complications of negotiating with self-proclaimed master dealmaker Donald Trump, Israel might be first to sign on the dotted line. After talks in No 10 last month, Theresa May and Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, announced a joint working group charged with \u201cpreparing the ground\u201d for a trade deal. The trade relationship between Israel and Britain is already worth \u00a34.9bn, and on Wednesday foreign secretary Boris Johnson told press in Jerusalem as he stood beside Netanyahu: \u201cWe are ... building a global identity as a Britain that\u2019s coming out of the EU and we want to build on our trading partnership with you. We are the biggest European trading partner with Israel \u2026 We have the largest, fastest-growing Aston Martin dealership anywhere in the world here in Israel.\u201d At his official residence on the outskirts of Tel Aviv, the British ambassador, David Quarrey, points to a growing economic relationship between the countries in the past 18 months. This included the biggest UK-Israel trade deal in history: Rolls-Royce landed a \u00a31bn contract to service and maintain its Trent 1000 engines for the airline El Al and, in the other direction, the Israeli defence firm Elbit Systems is in a consortium that provides the Ministry of Defence with training aircraft and simulators. Quarrey says: \u201cWe\u2019re seeing trading bilateral relationships between the UK and Israel, in science and trade for example, doing better than ever. But there\u2019s the potential to do even better, particularly in the context of Brexit. I was with Theresa May and Benjamin Netanyahu in London and it was clear there was the determination for this. \u201cMost businesspeople in Israel look at the UK as a great place to do business, because of its culture, language, and the predictability of the regulatory and tax systems.\u201d Britain, in effect, outsourced trade negotiations to European bureaucrats in the 1970s, so the way the newly formed Department for International Trade (DIT) thrashes out the Israel deal could provide a template for other business agreements. It is understood that the first meeting of the working group will take place by the end of this month. Two to four people will represent each side, including officials from the DIT and Israel\u2019s Ministry of Economy. They will set the parameters for future discussions, expected to take place two or three times a year. Regulatory and industry experts will be brought in on an ad hoc basis thereafter. At present, UK\u2013Israel trade is covered by the latter\u2019s association agreement with the EU. James Sorene, the chief executive at the Britain Israel Communications and Research Centre, says \u201cthe first priority will be to establish what preferential trade terms the UK is prepared to offer\u201d. Israelis are required to have work permits in the UK, though many are dual EU citizens and work freely in Britain. Given that this right would end on Brexit, Sorene points out: \u201cIf the UK\u2019s exit arrangements with the EU involve restricted movement for EU nationals this could indirectly cut the flow of Israeli tech workers to the UK, unless the UK designs a special arrangement for Israel.\u201d Technology is booming in Israel: Google, Apple, Facebook, and Microsoft all have research centres there, and there are 300,000 hi-tech workers in a country of only 8.5 million people.

We put out a monthly newspaper and ran a bookstore in deepest, darkest conservative Orange County. We all worked together, but there were plenty of gender assumptions at play. I refused to learn to make coffee or type so that I couldn\u2019t be stuck with those mundane tasks. The women in the group met in a consciousness-raising group. One question we asked ourselves was why it was always the men leading chants and making speeches at rallies and demonstrations. We decided it wasn\u2019t that they were unwilling to share, it was that we lacked confidence.</p> <p>So one night, we borrowed a bullhorn [megaphone] and headed down to the beach. We took turns getting a feel for the mechanics, and then we began using the bullhorn to amplify our voices, most of us for the first time ever. The noise of the waves gave us the perfect cover to experiment and let loose. I remember the freedom of standing out on the sand under the dark sky, finding my loudest voice, and letting it fly. I had never been in a situation before where I felt so free to fail and so free to succeed, and that night made me a different kind of woman.</p> <p>After that, the bullhorn was ours. A small battle, perhaps, but one that has come to mind in recent months as I\u2019ve watched so many women speaking from bullhorns and microphones. Who even thinks to notice it now? On such small battles, larger ones are won, and new worlds open up.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/08/fighting-for-equality-and-against-catcalling-the-battles-women-have-won\">Fighting for equality and against catcalling \u2013 the battles women have won</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58c0c41de4b0f24dba72322f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-09T02:57:46.586Z\">2.57am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Empire State building has been lit up in pink to mark the close of IWD on the <strong>US</strong> east coast.

Many hoped the result would be a government committed to tackling some of the deep-rooted issues facing Canadians.</p> <p>As many as 4,000 indigenous women <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/17/missing-and-murdered-indigenous-women-in-canada-could-number-4000\">have gone missing or been murdered in Canada in the past three decades.</a> Child care costs in the country <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/oecd-child-care-costs-1.3815954\">rank among the highest in the OECD</a>, while a persistent pay gap between men and women have sent the country tumbling from 19<sup>th</sup> to 35<sup>th</sup> place in recent years in the the <a href=\"http://reports.weforum.org/global-gender-gap-report-2016/rankings/\">World Economic Forum\u2019s global gender gap</a> rankings. </p> <p>The feminist scorecard offers a means to hold the prime minister to account by tracking annual progress on these issues and others. \u201cWe knew from experience that it\u2019s one thing to say something but words don\u2019t get you very far in the end, you still need to follow it up with concrete action,\u201d said Ravon. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people looking to Canada, so we want to say, what is the distance between the rhetoric and actual policy-making on the ground?\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.oxfam.ca/our-work/publications/time-to-turn-feminist-words-into-action\">The first scorecard, </a>released this week, noted that the government has yet to back its \u201cbold feminist rhetoric\u201d with concrete policy and spending decisions. The government has so-far demonstrated solid progress in just one area: Women\u2019s representation and leadership. \u201cYou can\u2019t overstate the importance of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/04/canada-cabinet-gender-diversity-justin-trudeau\">first gender balanced cabinet in Canadian history,</a>\u201d said Ravon. The government fared worst in the category of jobs, where Oxfam noted that no tangible steps have been taken to address the gender wage gap or ensure living wages for the working poor, the majority of whom are women. </p> <p>Still, the organisation was hopeful that the government would steadily improve its performance on the scorecard in the coming years. \u201cFor the most part we\u2019ve seen good first signs. Things are moving in the right direction,\u201d said Ravon. \u201cAs the Liberal government embarks on the second year of its mandate, it is time to turn feminist words into action.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, First Lady Sophie Gregoire Trudeau caused titters when she called on Canadians to celebrate International Women\u2019s Day by celebrating \u201cthe boys and men in our lives who encourage us to be who we truly are, who treat girls &amp; women with respect, and who aren\u2019t afraid to speak up in front of others\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=\"7\" style=\" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);\"><div style=\"padding:8px;\"> <div style=\" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;\"> <div style=\" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;\"></div></div> <p style=\" margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;\"> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BRV3rIAA6SO/\" style=\" color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;\" target=\"_blank\">Are you ready to ignite change?

The skin color change is particularly noticeable on faces with darker skin \u2013 as becomes apparent when Kahlo\u2019s own self-portrait is put through the filter.</p> <p>Kahlo, who was of mixed indigenous and European heritage, painted herself with brown skin and dark eyes.

It turns out a that lot factors people assume drive the wage gap actually play a small role. For instance, women\u2019s choices of careers alone <a href=\"http://www.epi.org/publication/what-is-the-gender-pay-gap-and-is-it-real/\">can\u2019t explain their pay disparity</a>.

But that hasn\u2019t meant that every woman in the workforce has been able to take part. Then and now, women have worked in jobs where striking just isn\u2019t an option.</p> <p>There are various reasons for that. In the US, women are <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat08.htm\">more likely</a> than men to work in part-time employment where workers are often considered more \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/17/opinion/sunday/disposable-workers.html\">disposable</a>\u201d. They are also less likely than men to receive a <a href=\"https://www.icrw.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/precarious-lives.pdf\">pension</a>, more likely than men to live in <a href=\"http://poverty.ucdavis.edu/faq/how-does-gender-relate-poverty-status\">poverty</a> and more likely to be paid hourly rates that are <a href=\"https://www.icrw.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/precarious-lives.pdf\">below</a>minimum wage. That makes striking risky, and this is before you even get to the astounding amount of unpaid work women do, including caregiver roles where taking a day off can be a matter of life and death.</p> <p>There are other occupations where women make up the majority. Pre-schoolers in America will have a tough time learning today if their teachers, 98% of whom are female, do decide to go on strike. More important though is healthcare \u2013 what would hospitals around the country look like if the 91% of nurses who are female simply didn\u2019t show up?</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/08/women-strike-inequality-poverty\">Read on</a> for a list of professions in which women dominate and for a look at the gender balance at the Guardian.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58c031b2e4b0bd9dcee56b83\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-08T18:38:04.080Z\">6.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Protests in Poland</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/crsdavies/status/839526620239134720\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Major demonstration in Warsaw&#39;s Constitution Square.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/IWD2017?src=hash\">#IWD2017</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/HLeD4FbCcU\">pic.twitter.com/HLeD4FbCcU</a></p>&mdash; Christian Davies (@crsdavies) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/crsdavies/status/839526620239134720\">March 8, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Women across Poland held demonstrations and marches on Wednesday to demand equal rights and protest violence.

I see the future. I see hope. And I\u2019m inspired because it will be women who lead the future. That is why I am writing to express my unconditional solidarity with the women\u2019s strike on International Women\u2019s Day, March 8.</p> <p>It would be easy for me to say that I am supporting this day of resistance because I have three daughters and I want nothing to stand in their way as they attempt to achieve their goals. I could also say that I am doing this because my wife, Pele \u2014 my best friend and soulmate \u2014 is of Samoan descent and has lived the struggle of being a woman and the daughter of immigrants. But this issue is a lot bigger than my dreams for my own family. It\u2019s about the women across the earth who are suffering: women who are less worried about a glass ceiling than they are about a collapsing floor. It\u2019s about women of color across the earth who live on less than one dollar a day.

But Toyin Saraki <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/13/good-news-gender-inquality-developing-world-education-maternity-women-hillary-clinton\">wrote in December</a> that the long-term trend is toward parity:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A reminder that while the status quo is unacceptable, the longer-term trend is pointed towards gender equality. And this trend is global, not simply confined to the western world. Just look at healthcare. Maternal mortality remains a mass killer in the developing world. It may not be as newsworthy as gender-based violence or as stark and immediate as disease or starvation, but it is the <a href=\"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs334/en/\">second biggest killer of women</a> of reproductive age in the developing world. This is changing.</p> <p>Due to a concerted focus not least through the recently concluded UN <a href=\"http://www.who.int/topics/millennium_development_goals/maternal_health/en/\">Millennium Development Goals</a>, the amount of women dying in childbirth has fallen by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2014/may/07/maternal-mortality-rate-drops-half-report-who-childbirth-pregnancy\">45% since 1990</a>. A staggering achievement. Gender-based development campaigns aimed at educating women have also pushed aside outmoded approaches to pregnancy and family planning, empowering women to take control of their own welfare in one of the most vulnerable periods of their lives.</p> <p>Improvement is also being made in education. While secondary education remains a critical problem in many developing countries, the challenge of primary school enrolment has virtually been solved. Enrolment rates globally are now on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/jul/04/mdgs-girls-match-boys-primary-school-enrolment\">near parity between boys and girls</a>.</p> <p>And what of the workplace? The top-line figures may be bleak, but there is evidence to suggest slow change is happening. A <a href=\"http://www.noceilings.org/\">study of 70 countries</a>, including many in the developing world, showed that since 1995 the gender wage gap has narrowed from 28% to 20%. The gap is still far too big.

Instead of outright striking and not showing up to work, I am protesting through silence to raise awareness of gender-based inequalities. My protest started at 6am and I will not speak again until 6pm. I came to work wearing the sign in the picture. I work in a male dominated field, so this has been attracting a lot of attention which is good, but also incredibly scary.</p> <p>So far people have mostly ignored the huge sign hanging from my neck, but if anybody starts reading it, I hand them out a card with a short list of reasons to explain why I&#39;m doing this. Sometimes I am met with ridicule, but even then people want to engage and discuss. A couple of times there has been heartfelt support and admitarion.

The day has more significance for ordinary citizens here than it does in the UK - most particularly in eastern parts, where under communism women - almost all of whom had jobs - were feted on this day, with flowers or being given time off work, sometimes even meals or drinks laid on by the boss, etc. Almost 30 years after the collapse of communism, this still happens in some workplaces, though the tradition is dying out. </p> <p>It\u2019s considered important enough that editorials in several leading German newspapers choose focus on it, arguing that recent global developments underline how we need IWD more than ever at a time when women\u2019s rights are so under attack. </p> <p>The liberal S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung from Munich writes: \u201cThe rise of populists in Germany, Russia, Turkey, America, Hungary, France and Poland has changed everything. They have brought back an image of women which we had thought had long been overcome. In Russia domestic violence will in future be treated as a much milder crime than it was previously, despite the fact that every year 12,000 women are battered to death by their partners. We should be under no illusion - despite regional differences, rights are being eroded in a similarly retrograde and discriminatory way. Women\u2019s rights are not collateral damage in the fight for the greater good, they are a barometer, a symptom of the internal state of a society.</p> <p>According to The Leipziger Volkszeitung: \u201cTrump, Putin and Erdogan are currently competing with each other in front of all of us for the position of biggest macho. What should we be doing to counteract this particularly difficult to deal with type of man?...Our motto should be \u2018the world needs strong women\u2019.</p> <p>The Lausitzer Rundschau, from Cottbus (like Leipzig in the former communist east) comments: \u201cthose who wants to change something but trusts in politics to do this, will wait forever. It was never a comfortable thing to fight for rights and freedoms. Dear women, you must become active yourselves, strengthen your networks and stand up together for your common interests. And we men should be your allies in this, and not just on this day.\u201d<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58bffa79e4b0f24dba722e6f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-08T12:36:09.116Z\">12.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This is wonderful footage of the Suffragettes marching on London in 1915 for the right to vote and equal pay from the British Film Insitute.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BFI/status/839422967163465728\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The fight for women&#39;s rights, 1915: Suffragettes march on London for equal pay and the right to vote <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BritainOnFilm?src=hash\">#BritainOnFilm</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/InternationalWomensDay?src=hash\">#InternationalWomensDay</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/ICthcuLhJa\">pic.twitter.com/ICthcuLhJa</a></p>&mdash; BFI (@BFI) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BFI/status/839422967163465728\">March 8, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58bff7e2e4b0bd9dcee56a2e\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/samjones\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-08T12:25:54.565Z\">12.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">IWD in Spain</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/swajones/status/839416416839303172\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">On <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/IWD?src=hash\">#IWD</a>, my i/v with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CapdeArguelles\">@CapdeArguelles</a> - Retrieving an untold story: voices of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Spanish?src=hash\">#Spanish</a> female artists finally heard <a href=\"https://t.co/SMUZlHd0il\">https://t.co/SMUZlHd0il</a></p>&mdash; Sam Jones (@swajones) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/swajones/status/839416416839303172\">March 8, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Some campaigners have argued that Spain still overlooks the massive contribution that women have made to society, culture and arts.</p> <p>As part of Madrid\u2019s belated efforts to honour some of the women who have been overshadowed by their more famous male peers, the city\u2019s mayor will unveil a plaque today to commemorate the Lyceum Women\u2019s Club, a meeting place for some of the leading intellectuals of pre-civil war Spain.</p> <p>The drive to remember their lives and contributions with plaques is being led by Nuria Capdevila-Arg\u00fcelles, a professor of Hispanic and gender studies at the University of Exeter.</p> <p>Capdevila-Arg\u00fcelles, and her film-maker collaborator, Tania Ballo, have so far provided the city council with research on more than 15 women, including the journalist, actor, writer and diplomat <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabel_Oyarz%C3%A1bal_Smith\">Isabel Oyarz\u00e1bal</a>, the lawyer and politician <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Kent\">Victoria Kent</a> and the poet <a href=\"https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernestina_de_Champourc%C3%ADn\">Ernestina de Champourc\u00edn</a>.<br><br></p> <p>\u201cPeople, both Spanish and British, have written about Spain\u2019s ghosts, but the most important ghosts are the women \u2013 the invisible 50%,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/15/voices-of-spanish-women-silenced-by-franco-are-being-heard-once-more\">Capdevila-Arg\u00fcelles told the Guardian recently</a>.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe role of history and an awareness of our past is utterly fundamental.

But no \u2026</p> <p>So for the last two International Women\u2019s Days I have tried to highlight this stupidity.

It goes on relentlessly, for hours and hours, but I try to get to them all because to see the same moronic question asked over and over again by people (who don\u2019t even think just to check Google to make sure they\u2019re not making an arse of themselves) is very funny, and shows exactly why an international women\u2019s day is necessary.</p> <p>Incidentally, nobody tweets me back to say: \u201cOh thanks for the information. I was wondering when it was.\u201d Almost like they don\u2019t want to know the answer to their own question.</p> <p>My hope is that if I can spend a day a year dealing with this issue, then that means that everyone else can get on with making International Women\u2019s Day about celebrating women and not complaining about the supposed raw deal men get. So I let men know that they do have a day if they want to celebrate themselves.

They technically went on everything-strike, but since their democratic exclusion was mirrored in the workplace, this functionally meant they stopped looking after their children and doing the washing-up (those who did have jobs worked in schools and nurseries, so those had to close as well). A staggering 90% of women took part, after the genius move of renaming it, not a strike, but a \u201cWomen\u2019s Day Off\u201d, dressing up stridency as me-time. Men had to take their children to work, which gave the event its other name: The Long Friday.</p> <p>This action <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/03/iceland-best-country-women-feminist\">changed the face of Icelandic politics</a>, delivering to Europe its first female president, Vigd\u00eds Finnbogad\u00f3ttir, five years later. But its significance in the wider feminist landscape is subtler, since that tension of where you situate domestic labour in the fight for equality is, if anything, more pronounced now than it was then. Feminism at home sounds a lot like nagging. The strike was underpinned by a movement, the radical Red Stockings in Iceland, and sister organisations across Europe making the case for paid housework.<br></p> <p>We now broadly reject domestic responsibilities as innately female, so would struggle to galvanise action around them. Yet we still do most of them (statistically, I mean; I don\u2019t personally, I am a slut) and they are still unpaid. I struggle to see much victory in this turn of events.</p> <p>If you want victory, go to Poland: \u201cThe so-called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/24/polish-abortion-law-protesters-march-against-proposed-restrictions\">Black Protest</a> last October,\u201d feminist activist Katarzyna Bielinska tells me, \u201cwas provoked by an attempt to tighten already the extremely restrictive abortion law in Poland by introducing an even more barbarian bill, banning abortion totally, making a woman who aborts liable for five years\u2019 imprisonment, criminalising miscarriage and blocking prenatal foetus investigation and treatment.\u201d Tens of thousands of women went on strike, or \u2013 this detail pleases me \u2013 went to work but dressed in black, and didn\u2019t do anything. More than 140 cities, towns and municipalities were profoundly affected, especially public-sector work.</p> <p>\u201cThe success was huge and unexpected,\u201d Bielinska says. \u201cThe governing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/25/poland-lurches-to-right-with-election-of-law-and-justice-party\">Law and Justice party</a> rejected the bill three days after.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/07/sex-bans-womens-strikes-international-womens-day\">Sex bans, strength and solidarity: women\u2019s strikes through the ages</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-03-08T07:19:16.431Z\">at 7.19am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58bfac6ce4b00bd41ba4fc1b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-03-08T07:06:35.709Z\">7.06am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Today is on course to be one of the most political International Women\u2019s Days in history, Alexandra Topping and Molly Redden report:</p> <blockquote> <p>From <strong>Thailand</strong> to <strong>Poland</strong>, the <strong>United States</strong> to <strong>Australia</strong>, the first <a href=\"http://www.globalwomenstrike.net/\">Global Women\u2019s Strike</a> will see action on both the industrial and domestic fronts, with participants keen to show solidarity with an energised global women\u2019s movement.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe are united, we are international \u2013 and we are everywhere,\u201d said Klementyna Suchanow, a Poland-based organiser of the Global Women\u2019s Strike, adding that the walkout would put governments and institutions under pressure by giving women a voice that has long been ignored. \u201cWe are an army of women across the globe and we are no longer asking to be listened to.

There is much to celebrate when it comes to progress for women throughout the world. There is also much to lament, both in relation to what still needs to be done and where the gains we have made risk going backwards.</p> <p>Stillbirth, however, is standing still. The incidence of stillbirth is the same today as it has been for decades. Very little money or attention goes into research to reduce or prevent stillbirth.<br></p> <p>Why? Stillbirth struggles on two fronts.</p> <p>One, stillbirth is a thing that happens inside a woman\u2019s body. In a male-dominated world, stillbirth is easily relegated as a private tragedy rather than as a public health matter.</p> <p>Two, stillbirth is not a cause feminists want to champion. Even though stillbirth is a tragedy for thousands of women each year, most feminists don\u2019t want to talk about the death of a baby inside its mother\u2019s womb. Many feminists get uneasy about anything that gets a bit too close to abortion rights.</p> <p>So let\u2019s be clear: stillbirth happens to women who want to be mothers, who have chosen to take a baby to term. It has nothing to do with abortion. Many mothers of stillborn babies are pro-choice and would not seek to restrict women\u2019s access to abortion services.</p> <p>If feminists believe women\u2019s choices should be respected, then there is nothing to fear from recognising a woman\u2019s choice to be a mother.

This is creating a huge demand for foreign \u2018wives\u2019.</p> <p>We heard devastating stories from women who have returned from China. One told us how she travelled to what she thought was a well-paying job in the north of Myanmar, only to be sold into marriage in China. She was trapped near Beijing for seven years, and had two daughters with her \u2018husband\u2019, only to then be deported by Chinese police to Myanmar. She has not had contact with her daughters since then.</p> <p>Another told us how she was deceived by a friend (who turned out to be a marriage broker) to travel to the border with China. There she was sold to a Chinese man for US$9,300. When she did not become pregnant within seven months, this man sold her to another Chinese man for $11,500. She was trapped in that \u2018marriage\u2019 for three years before her family and Myanmar police managed to secure her release.

If you get pregnant with a third child, abortion is compulsory. But I don\u2019t see our free access to abortion as a sign of progress, as reproductive rights only apply to married women.

We care for our partners (though in a genuine relationship it is certainly not a one-way street). We care for our children. We care for others\u2019 children. We care for our parents as they grow older. And we fill the jobs equated with caring. In my sector, 97% of us are women.<br></p> <p>It is not because the work we do has no value. It is because the work we do has an intrinsic female association. \u2018Care\u2019 in any role should not be seen as of little value. If anything, it should be seen as value-adding to the role. Look at aged care workers, educators, nurses, teachers, social workers, psychologists, therapists, tutors, doctors. None of these professions are seen only as caring, but care is understood as intrinsic to their role.</p> <p>But it is we in early childhood who forever need to point out that we are the same: we do caring but our whole job is far more than that.</p> <p>I am walking off because I want the government and society to recognise that an early childhood educator is a professional role and one that must be given its deserved status.

It goes on relentlessly, for hours and hours, but I try to get to them all because to see the same moronic question asked over and over again by people (who don\u2019t even think just to check Google to make sure they\u2019re not making an arse of themselves) is very funny, and shows exactly why an international women\u2019s day is necessary.</p> <p>Incidentally, nobody tweets me back to say: \u201cOh thanks for the information. I was wondering when it was.\u201d Almost like they don\u2019t want to know the answer to their own question.</p> <p>My hope is that if I can spend a day a year dealing with this issue, then that means that everyone else can get on with making International Women\u2019s Day about celebrating women and not complaining about the supposed raw deal men get. So I let men know that they do have a day if they want to celebrate themselves.

          "bodyText": "As International Women\u2019s Day draws to a close, so does our live coverage. So what next? If you\u2019re one of our readers in the US, you can sign up for our freshly launched newsletter tracking the progress of the resistance on feminism and beyond. Or join the Guardian US Facebook community. To keep up with the week in patriarchy, you can sign up for Jessica Valenti\u2019s email roundup and read Laura Bates on everyday sexism. Globally, track news on women\u2019s rights and gender equality, and feminism. Knit a pussy hat. Tell us how you marked IWD and what you\u2019ll be doing next. Speak. Thank you for your comments and contributions. A late entrant for most uncomfortable attempt to use IWD for unrelated political point-scoring comes from the US House Ways and Means committee, where representatives are debating the proposed changes to healthcare provisions. Missouri\u2019s Republican congressman, Jason Smith, is concerned that women are \u2013 under Obamacare \u2013 paying tax on their visits to tanning salons. Why is nobody talking about this on International Women\u2019s Day, he wanted to know. (I\u2019m not sure he genuinely wanted to know, but he did say it.) Washington Democrat congresswoman Suzan DelBene thought women might have more pressing concerns when it came to healthcare: birth control, for one. Ahead of International Women\u2019s Day, we asked readers to share stories about the battles you\u2019ve won. You can read them all here, and here is just one example of the responses we received: Brenda Carter, El Cerrito, California In 1969, I was a college student and part of a hippy-communist collective. We put out a monthly newspaper and ran a bookstore in deepest, darkest conservative Orange County. We all worked together, but there were plenty of gender assumptions at play. I refused to learn to make coffee or type so that I couldn\u2019t be stuck with those mundane tasks. The women in the group met in a consciousness-raising group. One question we asked ourselves was why it was always the men leading chants and making speeches at rallies and demonstrations. We decided it wasn\u2019t that they were unwilling to share, it was that we lacked confidence. So one night, we borrowed a bullhorn [megaphone] and headed down to the beach. We took turns getting a feel for the mechanics, and then we began using the bullhorn to amplify our voices, most of us for the first time ever. The noise of the waves gave us the perfect cover to experiment and let loose. I remember the freedom of standing out on the sand under the dark sky, finding my loudest voice, and letting it fly. I had never been in a situation before where I felt so free to fail and so free to succeed, and that night made me a different kind of woman. After that, the bullhorn was ours. A small battle, perhaps, but one that has come to mind in recent months as I\u2019ve watched so many women speaking from bullhorns and microphones. Who even thinks to notice it now? On such small battles, larger ones are won, and new worlds open up. The Empire State building has been lit up in pink to mark the close of IWD on the US east coast. (The women\u2019s march has done a pretty solid job of reclaiming pink as a protest colour.) To mark International Women\u2019s Day in Brazil, football team Cruzeiro tonight wore specially commissioned squad numbers with messages to highlight daily challenges faced by women in the South American country. Cruizero won their Brazilian Cup match against Murici-AL 2-0. The shirts featured a different message for each number such as \u201ca rape every 11 minutes\u201d or \u201csalaries 30% lower\u201d, organised in conjunction with the NGO AzMina, which fights for female empowerment in Brazil. Announcing the initiative on their website on Wednesday, the Belo Horizonte-based club\u2019s president Gilvan de Pinho Tavares said: In the 21st century, it is not tolerable to see women suffer acts of violence and discrimination. With this action, we join all who combat inequalities against people of the feminine sex. This is one of the social roles that big fan clubs must always be developing. International Women\u2019s Day is not just a moment to bring to the surface all the characteristics of inequality that still exist in Brazil and the world, but it is also a moment of awareness of other aspects related to women. It\u2019s important to have a moment of this, where you can bring up such important and women-related issues. It\u2019s getting loud in Los Angeles: Reuters has spoken to some of the women who took part in protests in the US today: Debra Sands, a middle-school teacher, joined thousands of women at New York City\u2019s Central Park after her students convinced her to attend. \u201cThis past year\u2019s election made me realize that voting in November isn\u2019t enough,\u201d Sands said. In San Francisco, where about 1,500 people gathered, Christine Bussenius said she and her female colleagues at Grey Advertising convinced their all-male managers to give them the day off and participate in the rally. \u201cWe were nervous,\u201d she admitted. \u201cBut the men stepped up to fill in the void.\u201d Rallies were held in numerous cities, including Washington, where demonstrators gathered at the US labor department. Female staffers at Fusion Media Group\u2019s Gizmodo declared they were striking for the day. At least three US school districts, in Virginia, Maryland and North Carolina, closed because of staff shortages after teachers requested the day off. Nearly 1,000 women converged outside Los Angeles City Hall, many of them critical of the Republican-backed healthcare bill that would strip women\u2019s health and abortion provider Planned Parenthood of funding. \u201cIt\u2019s terrifying. It\u2019s anti-woman,\u201d said Kassia Krozsur, a finance professional. About 200 gathered in Atlanta, where signs read \u201cWe are sisters\u201d and \u201cStop Trump.\u201d \u201cIf we want to change what is going on, we need to turn anger into action. People need to run for local office,\u201d organizer Rebekah Joy said. Pakistan Macedonia Yemen Lebanon Egypt In the US, Time reports that several women\u2019s march organisers who were arrested earlier on Wednesday in New York have now been released. Organisers Tamika Mallory, Linda Sarsour, Carmen Perez and Bob Bland were among a number of protesters detained close to the Trump Hotel at Columbus Circle. Most \u2013 including Mallory, Sarsour and Perez \u2013 were freed on Wednesday evening, Time reported, but others remain in custody: Yet to be released by 8pm on Wednesday was Sophie Ellman-Golan, a 24-year old activist whose mother Rabbi Barat Ellman was arrested about three weeks ago for protesting the Trump\u2019s travel ban. \u201cI\u2019m incredible proud of her,\u201d said Ellman as she waited outside the precinct for her daughter to be released. \u201cFor a long time she\u2019s been a woman who puts her feet where her mouth is.\u201d The ONE campaign, an international organization aimed at ending extreme poverty and eradicating preventable diseases, staged several hundred walk-ins around the globe earlier today to rally for women\u2019s education. One of its largest events took place in Nigeria, in Ekiti State, with several hundred students and activists. In the western part of the country, dozens holding signs to protest the worldwide gender disparity in education marched and blocked traffic on a 5km march starting at the University of Ibadan. Feminists across the Americas have been holding a day-long live marathon of radio programming \u2013 due to come to an end at 10pm Argentina time, in around half an hour from now. The #MaratonaRadialFeminista has featured women and their stories from Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Canada, Nicaragua, Mexico and Uruguay \u2013 with European solidarity from Spain and Switzerland \u2013 on Red Nosotras Radio. Organisers say: The sorority and joy of being together, without losing our anger, will once again break the frontiers. France\u2019s president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, has lambasted what he called a decline in women\u2019s rights in the United States and Russia. AFP reports: Speaking on International Women\u2019s Day, the French leader said that \u201cthreats of backtracking\u201d on women\u2019s rights don\u2019t just come from \u201cemerging nations or countries under dictatorships, but also in developed and rich countries\u201d. \u201cWhat about positions or intentions expressed by the new US administration?\u201d he asked. They would \u201creduce funding for family planning, as if this is the first cut to be made to allow an increase in military spending\u201d, he added. Hollande also took aim at Moscow\u2019s policies, pointing out that a law that penalised violence against family members had recently been modified. \u201cWhy would anyone change this text except to once again attack the freedom of women?\u201d he said. Hollande, who is coming to the end of his tenure and not standing for re-election, added that in Poland there had recently been protests against attempts to impose a near total ban on abortions. Such moves to row back on women\u2019s rights stem from \u201creligious fundamentalism\u201d and \u201cthe resurgence of reactionary ideologies which intend to reassign women to the procreative role in the domestic sphere\u201d, he said. Women have been marching in Buenos Aires, Argentina; reader Ella Jessel, who is there, has shared this video and images with me. (You can send your own contributions, from wherever you are marking IWD, to me on Twitter @Claire_Phipps.) Last October, tens of thousands of women marched in Buenos Aires to push back against violence against women. The hashtag #NiUnaMenos (\u201cNot one less\u201d, meaning not one more woman lost to male violence) has become a powerful rallying cry for women in Argentina and other South American countries. Tens of thousands of women took to the streets across Turkey earlier on Wednesday, AFP reports: In Istanbul over 10,000 people, mostly women, walked the long Istiklal Avenue, chanting \u201cend male-perpetrated violence\u201d and \u201cTayyip, Tayyip, run, run, we are coming\u201d. \u201cTayyip\u201d refers to the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who is seeking to create an executive presidency that would see the post of prime minister abolished. On 16 April, the Turkish public will vote on whether to change the current system, which the government argues causes instability \u2013 while critics claim greater powers for Erdogan will lead to one-man rule. A deep purple dominated the colourful crowds in Istanbul who held placards saying \u201cwomen are free\u201d and \u201cwe are strong united\u201d. The march was organised by multiple women\u2019s rights groups and attendees included LGBT individuals, young women, students and also men \u2013 many of whom were carrying \u201cNo\u201d posters. For Nurten Karanci who attended the march, being a woman in Turkey means a \u201cfight to live, to survive\u201d. Last year, a woman was attacked in Istanbul for wearing shorts on a public bus while another woman wearing a headscarf said she was kicked and insulted last month. Women\u2019s activists often call for an end to violence against women in a country where hundreds of women are killed every year, often by their husbands. Despite a heavy police presence and water cannon trucks on standby, the Istanbul march took place peacefully as they walked from Taksim Square to Sishane on the other end of the avenue on the European side of Istanbul. Members of the pro-Kurdish Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party (HDP), whose two co-leaders remain under arrest accused of terror links, also took part of the march in Istanbul. Meanwhile in Ankara women hit tambourines and held \u201cNo\u201d posters shouting their opposition to giving \u201cone man\u201d all the power. In the Kurdish-majority southeastern city of Diyarbakir, hundreds of people staged a demonstration for women\u2019s rights, dancing and playing music. One participant, Sabiba Akgul, said all women \u201cshould stand up and support each other. Hand in hand, they will find freedom.\u201d Activist Ozlem Gul in Istanbul described the difficulty of being a woman in Turkey: Being a woman anyhow is very complicated, especially today. We have to fight against many things. We have to fight against the attacks on our bodies, our work, our opinions. We are in the streets, we won\u2019t let up, and we will keep on the fight as Turkish women. In Australia, the feminist and author Germaine Greer has said that aiming for equality is a \u201cprofoundly conservative goal\u201d for women, speaking at the launch of her archive at the University of Melbourne on Wednesday night. Greer told an audience of about 500 people at the Kathleen Fitzpatrick Theatre for the International Women\u2019s Day event: What everybody has accepted is the idea of equality feminism. It will change nothing. War is made against civilian populations where women and children are the principal casualties in places like Syria, whether in collapsing buildings or bombed schools. War is now completely made by the rich with their extraordinary killing machines, killing the poor who have no comeback. Women are drawing level with men in this profoundly destructive world that we live in and, as far as I\u2019m concerned, it\u2019s the wrong way. We\u2019re getting nowhere. If we\u2019re going to change things I think we\u2019re going to have to start creating a women\u2019s polity that is strong, that has its own way of operating, that makes contact with women in places like Syria, and that challenges the right of destructive nations. Women needed to aim higher and achieve more than simply drawing level with men and entering into traditionally male-dominated fields, Greer said: If what happens when women discover when they join the army is they discover it\u2019s no place for a sane human being then they\u2019ve learned something. But right now, things are looking distinctly grim. In Brazil, a message from President Michel Temer to mark IWD has been met with some incredulity, as he praised women for their home-making skills and ability to spot a supermarket bargain: Temer does not have great form: on taking over as president last year, he installed a new cabinet with zero women in it. Women marching in Brazilian cities today expressed anger towards Temer, as my colleague Jonathan Watts reports: Rio de Janeiro, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brasilia and Porto Alegre each saw hundreds of demonstrators mark International Women\u2019s Day with banners and chants of Fora Temer! (Michel Temer Out!), a reference to the current president who came to power by plotting the impeachment of Brazil\u2019s first woman president \u2013 and his former running mate \u2013 Dilma Rousseff. The conservative president did little to mollify their anger with a speech in which he lauded how much women do around the house and the important role they play in assessing supermarket prices. He also noted that more an economic recovery will enable more women to enter the workplace in addition to their \u201cdomestic chores.\u201d On taking power last year, Temer abolished the ministry of women, racial equality and human rights, and cut programs on gender equality. His 28-member cabinet now includes only two women. Critics say his pension reform plans will hit women harder than men. Hi, this is Claire Phipps picking up the live blog, with thanks to Molly. I\u2019ll continue to cover IWD events live as they happen, everywhere in the globe it\u2019s still 8 March. Do send me your contributions from wherever you are, on Twitter @Claire_Phipps or in the comments below. Here\u2019s a female role model if ever we saw (or read) one: Matilda sees something she likes in Wall St\u2019s Fearless Girl: The Fearless Girl statue appeared overnight just down the road from Wall Street, defiantly staring down the famous bronze bull. The statue of a young girl, hands on hips, was instantly providing a good PR story for investment company State Street Global Advisors, who installed the statue for International Women\u2019s Day and called on companies to put more women on their boards. But it also provided a nice background for New York journalists in search of an International Women\u2019s Day story. The Guardian was asked by two separate news organizations for interviews when it popped down to visit, with Buzzfeed livestreaming the statue on its site. Thanks to the bull, that corner of Broadway is always pumping with tourists, but Fearless Girl made the crowds even worse than normal. Even if it was just a clever marketing stunt, these girls didn\u2019t care. At least 100 people marched in downtown Washington, DC to demand equal pay and protections for women workers. Activists marched to celebrate International Women\u2019s Day and protest violence against women in San Salvador. Hundreds took part in an International Women\u2019s Day rally at Candelaria square in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Guardian correspondent Jon Watts reports: At a demonstration in central Rio de Janeiro, several hundred women protested against sexual violence, unequal wages and the current government of President Michel Temer, who ousted his female running mate Dilma Rousseff last year. \u201cTemer is a coup monger and a misogynist,\u201d said student Kharine Dantes. \u201cHe wants to repeal quotas for women parliamentarians and to outlaw the morning-after pill.\u201d Outside the City council building in Rio de Janeiro, Workers Party activists handed out black balloons each marked with a different statistic about violence against women in Brazil: a rape every two hours, three-fifths of young women suffering violence from their partners and 40% of police women tend victims of sexual harassment. \u201cThis is a day of struggle as well as celebration,\u201d said Micaela Costa. \u201cThe problem of violence and harassment is terrible but at least it is becoming more visible.\u201d Dozens of women gathered in Lafayette Square in front of the White House to protest a US policy that bans international NGOs from providing abortion services or offering information about abortions if they receive US funding. President Trump imposed what critics call the \u201cglobal gag rule\u201d in an executive order he signed just after taking office. The policy has put thousands of international healthcare workers in a difficult position; they must decide whether to continue to offer family planning care that includes abortion or to preserve a critical funding stream. The US is the single largest donor to global health efforts. But many international health advocates insist that their efforts are not comprehensive without abortion services. Worldwide, unsafe abortions are a major cause of maternal mortality and kill tens of thousands of women every year. Oops. Despite being a self-declared feminist with a gender balanced cabinet, Justin Trudeau and his Liberal government have fallen short when it comes to translating rhetoric into real change for the country\u2019s women, according to a new \u201cfeminist scorecard\u201d from Oxfam Canada. Many in the country were hopeful when the prime minister publicly proclaimed himself a feminist after being elected in 2015, said Lauren Ravon of Oxfam. Many hoped the result would be a government committed to tackling some of the deep-rooted issues facing Canadians. As many as 4,000 indigenous women have gone missing or been murdered in Canada in the past three decades. Child care costs in the country rank among the highest in the OECD, while a persistent pay gap between men and women have sent the country tumbling from 19th to 35th place in recent years in the the World Economic Forum\u2019s global gender gap rankings. The feminist scorecard offers a means to hold the prime minister to account by tracking annual progress on these issues and others. \u201cWe knew from experience that it\u2019s one thing to say something but words don\u2019t get you very far in the end, you still need to follow it up with concrete action,\u201d said Ravon. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people looking to Canada, so we want to say, what is the distance between the rhetoric and actual policy-making on the ground?\u201d The first scorecard, released this week, noted that the government has yet to back its \u201cbold feminist rhetoric\u201d with concrete policy and spending decisions. The government has so-far demonstrated solid progress in just one area: Women\u2019s representation and leadership. \u201cYou can\u2019t overstate the importance of the first gender balanced cabinet in Canadian history,\u201d said Ravon. The government fared worst in the category of jobs, where Oxfam noted that no tangible steps have been taken to address the gender wage gap or ensure living wages for the working poor, the majority of whom are women. Still, the organisation was hopeful that the government would steadily improve its performance on the scorecard in the coming years. \u201cFor the most part we\u2019ve seen good first signs. Things are moving in the right direction,\u201d said Ravon. \u201cAs the Liberal government embarks on the second year of its mandate, it is time to turn feminist words into action.\u201d Meanwhile, First Lady Sophie Gregoire Trudeau caused titters when she called on Canadians to celebrate International Women\u2019s Day by celebrating \u201cthe boys and men in our lives who encourage us to be who we truly are, who treat girls &amp; women with respect, and who aren\u2019t afraid to speak up in front of others\u201d. Many US female journalists are in a tricky spot today: should they go on strike in solidarity or work to cover women focused stories that otherwise would be ignored? Different media outlets, particularly women-focused ones, are trying out different methods. Bustle is on strike. MTV adjusted its logo to make it a W for women. Glamour colored its logo red in solidarity with the women\u2019s strike, and all its coverage is focused on International Women\u2019s Day and the strike. New York Magazine\u2019s The Cut is on strike, \u201cto show solidarity with the women around the world who are standing up for equal pay and equal opportunity, reproductive freedom, an end to sexual assaults, an end to bigotry of all kinds, and policies that support our families like parental leave, health care, and child care.\u201d Teen Vogue is also striking: Although as an editorial staff we are privileged to have this platform and audience (as well as the opportunity to take a day off of work), journalism is still an industry that disproportionately awards leadership and power to men, and as a result, we still struggle to be taken seriously when we talk about politics. Jezebel is letting male colleagues take over the site for the day, and it\u2019s proving to be the most fascinating media experiment of the day. As editor-in-chief Emma Carmichael wrote: Publishing for a majority women audience is quite different from publishing for Deadspin or Gizmodo, and we want them to be thoughtful about how they package news and write criticism for Jezebel on a politically meaningful day for many women around the world. We\u2019re asking them to take that responsibility on without much of our guidance and advice, and if they stumble in that pursuit, we hope you notice. A few of our brave volunteers have confessed to being a bit nervous about this experiment, and we agree that they should be. If the site feels different or off or even just \u201cbad\u201d tomorrow, that is very much the point. It\u2019s been\u2026interesting. The first post of the day was a somewhat self-congratulatory entry by Jim Cooke about feminists using an illustration he created. Another post is titled \u201cSo Now There\u2019s a Girl on Wall Street\u201d. Hamilton Nolan wrote about the left-wing woke men who describe themselves as \u201callies\u201d while actually being insufferable creeps. Here at The Guardian, our female staffers are working, but I\u2019ve got my own personal strike motto So far so good! More than a 100 women arrived today in Mexico City\u2019s Historic Center, known as Zocalo, to celebrate International Women\u2019s Day. By mid-day, a fair organized by the Women\u2019s Institute of Mexico City had garnered almost 80 civil organizations and government initiatives to promote awareness on safety. \u201cSince 2015, Mexico City is part of the global initiative for the provision of safe cities and public spaces for women,\u201d InMujeres General Director Teresa Inchaustegui told The Guardian. \u201cThis is a topic very important for females particularly young ones who suffer the most.\u201d Inchaustegui said the local government is supporting women who will join the international labor strike and march scheduled to take place at 4pm next to the Angel of Independence in Reforma. Several groups of activists including Ni una menos movement, female members of the Workers Union and the Citizen Assembly for the Rights of Women are expected to join the demands against gender violence and inequality. \u201cWe will strike because we are fed up of violence,\u201d Areli Castillo said. One of the founders of the Citizen Assembly, Castillo criticized the government\u2019s festival partly because \u201cthey see it as a party, to congratulate women but don\u2019t need compliments, we need recognition.\u201d Melissa Cuevas, 31, is preparing to attend the march this afternoon as she sees it as \u201ca way to increase awareness among the population.\u201d Cuevas attributes gender inequality to \u201ca strong patriarchal approach in the society which consider that women are inferior, and based on this belief different problems arise, but the belief behind it is the main cause of it.\u201d In most parts of Mexico City, the day continues under the notion business as usual. Female entrepreneur Maria del Mar Gargari said \u201cI won\u2019t participate because I have a small business and cannot leave it unattended.\u201d According to statistics from the National Citizen Observatory of Femicides, seven Mexican women are killed everyday because of gender-based violence. Several hundred protesters have descended on the Utah state capitol for A Day Without a Woman protest. The AP reports: Hundreds of women dressed in red and holding signs with photos of their local lawmakers are gathering at the Utah state capitol for a Day Without a Woman protest to remind legislators they\u2019re closely watching how they handle women\u2019s issues. Crowds of women stood outside both the state\u2019s House and Senate on Wednesday to send notes to lawmakers asking them to come out to talk with them. Salt Lake City resident Chelsi Archibald says she skipped work at her marketing job to attend the event and send a note to Republican Sen. Todd Weiler, urging his support of the Equal Rights Amendment. International Women\u2019s Day protests are still happening sporadically across the US. In New York, at least 10 organizers were arrested by the NYPD, said a spokeswoman for the event. In Washington, DC, dozens of protesters marched on the Department of Labor demanding equal pay. And on TV, the revolution was color-coordinated. Snapchat is celebrating Mexican artist Frida Kahlo on International Women\u2019s Day with a filter that lightens the skin of users. Snapchat debuted three custom filters for the day, which is being marked in the United States with protests and strikes. The filters allows users to take self-portraits as Kahlo, civil rights activist Rosa Parks, or scientist Marie Curie. But on a day to celebrate international feminism, Snapchat\u2019s filters have raised some eyebrows. The Frida Kahlo filter lightens a user\u2019s skin and eyes and applies bright red lipstick, a floral headdress and braids, and the artist\u2019s signature unibrow. The skin color change is particularly noticeable on faces with darker skin \u2013 as becomes apparent when Kahlo\u2019s own self-portrait is put through the filter. Kahlo, who was of mixed indigenous and European heritage, painted herself with brown skin and dark eyes. Much of her work engaged with indigenous themes and imagery. The filter for Nobel Prize-winning physicist and chemist applies smoky eye makeup and lengthens the eye lashes. Curie is best known for her groundbreaking research on radioactivity. She was awarded the Nobel Prize twice, once for chemistry and once for physics. For International Women\u2019s Day, the Economic Policy Institute, a progressive think tank, is sharing some facts about the persistent wage gap in the United States. A lot of EPI\u2019s output has focused on which factors do not explain the wage gap. It turns out a that lot factors people assume drive the wage gap actually play a small role. For instance, women\u2019s choices of careers alone can\u2019t explain their pay disparity. And women can\u2019t simply educate themselves out of the pay gap. Women who hold advanced degrees still earn less, on average, than men with only a bachelor\u2019s degree. Then, there\u2019s the one-two punch of gender and racial bias. In the US, the wage gap is much bigger if you\u2019re a woman of color. In fact, while the overall wage gap has narrowed over the past four decades, the disparity between white women\u2019s wages and black women\u2019s is one of the fastest-growing gaps in the economy. That gap has increased the most for college-educated black women who are just entering the market. Latina women are even further behind when their wages are compared alongside white workers\u2019. For every dollar a white man is paid, white women are paid 81 cents, black women 65 cents, and Hispanic women 58 cents. Women have made forward progress in gaining managerial roles, but those gains have almost all gone to white women. Meanwhile, the minimum wage workers who have seen their wages freeze are more likely to be women of color. Women are nearly two-thirds of the minimum wage workforce, and the majority of women earning minimum wage or less are women of color. Hundreds of women farmers across Brazil occupied government offices in protest of new policies they say disproportionately harm poor, rural women. In one instance of protest, women from Brazil\u2019s Landless Workers Movement staged an occupation of an abandoned farm belonging to a prominent businessman jailed on charges of corruption. The land, said Ani Hao, a national organizer, belongs to Eike Batista, an oil and gas magnate who was arrested in the course of a multimillion dollar money laundering investigation. One hundred families will camp and farm on its 3,000 hectares, said Hao. Their occupation came as hundreds protesters marched across Brazilian cities or took over public offices. The demonstrators said pension reforms and other changes to social security will make it harder for family farmers to stay on the land. from Reuters: Brazilian officials say the changes, including raising the minimum retirement age for rural workers to 65 years and higher pension contributions, are crucial for South America\u2019s largest country to escape a fiscal crisis and recession. \u201cRural workers live on the margins,\u201d said Sejane Alexandre, a protester in Tocantins State in central Brazil\u2019s agricultural belt. \u201cThe rural worker does not have the same longevity and access to healthcare (as urban employees),\u201d she said, according to local media. In Recife, on Brazil\u2019s northeastern coast, around 1,000 female land rights activists occupied the government\u2019s social security office, the Pastoral Land Commission campaign group said in a statement. About seventy percent of the food consumed by Brazilians is produced by family farmers, according to the United Nations, but small producers often complain about unequal land distribution and poor government services in rural areas. First Lady Melania Trump celebrated International Women\u2019s Day with salsify and spinach gnocchi at a private luncheon at the White House. Guests included Trump aide Kellyanne Conway, Ivanka Trump, Karen Pence, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, Sen. Susan Collins, Small Business Administration chair-slash-former WWE executive Linda McMahon, and a 2015 Viognier from Sonoma County. Mona Chalabi writes for the Guardian that not all women can strike today \u2013 some, because they lack the power, and some, because the work can\u2019t happen without them: International Women\u2019s Day has always been tied to labor rights (first by the Socialist Party of America in 1908, and later by female textile workers in Russia in 1917). But that hasn\u2019t meant that every woman in the workforce has been able to take part. Then and now, women have worked in jobs where striking just isn\u2019t an option. There are various reasons for that. In the US, women are more likely than men to work in part-time employment where workers are often considered more \u201cdisposable\u201d. They are also less likely than men to receive a pension, more likely than men to live in poverty and more likely to be paid hourly rates that are belowminimum wage. That makes striking risky, and this is before you even get to the astounding amount of unpaid work women do, including caregiver roles where taking a day off can be a matter of life and death. There are other occupations where women make up the majority. Pre-schoolers in America will have a tough time learning today if their teachers, 98% of whom are female, do decide to go on strike. More important though is healthcare \u2013 what would hospitals around the country look like if the 91% of nurses who are female simply didn\u2019t show up? Read on for a list of professions in which women dominate and for a look at the gender balance at the Guardian. Women across Poland held demonstrations and marches on Wednesday to demand equal rights and protest violence. In Warsaw, hundred gathered before the office of Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the head of Poland\u2019s conservative party and a supporter of the government\u2019s recent efforts to ban abortion. A group of US Democratic congresswomen spoke before a crowd of dozens dressed in red on the steps of the US Capitol. The rally was part of a symbolic walkout some Democrats in the House staged for #DayWithoutAWoman \u2013 a protest the speakers linked directly to Trump and the GOP. \u201cWe are resisting Trump and congressional Republicans and letting them know we will not go back,\u201d said Rep. Barbara Lee of California. \u201cWe walked out today for A Day Without a Woman to send a clear message: that we stand with our sisters across the country who have walked out in defense of equal rights for women\u2026We are raising our voices for the millions of women who can\u2019t.\u201d Amid signs reading \u201cWomen\u2019s Rights are Human Rights,\u201d Lee hailed women of color who \u201cwork twice as hard for half the pay\u201d. Her colleagues denounced the high rates of violence facing trans women, and the renewed threat of deportation facing many immigrants. Rep. Brenda Lawrence of Michigan read out a list of statistics that would reflect a day without women. \u201cA day without a woman is a day of great loss for America and for the world,\u201d she said. \u201cA day without a woman is a day without the primary or sole earner for 40% of households\u201d with young children. \u201cA day without a woman is a day without 47% of the nation\u2019s workforce. A day without a woman is a day without 80% of the health care workforce in America\u201d and \u201cclose to 80% of the elementary and middle school educators in this country.\u201d \u201cYou would think our numbers would be enough to convince people of the needs for equality for women in America,\u201d she concluded. \u201cBut we still have a long way to go.\u201d The White House office of the Press Secretary released the following statement to mark International Women\u2019s Day. International Women\u2019s Day gives us the opportunity to celebrate and reflect upon the meaningful progress women have made throughout society, while also acknowledging that there is still much work that remains to be done to ensure the complete and consequential participation of women in all spheres of economic, political, and public life. Throughout our history, women have made enormous contributions in the service of our country, and we know that as a Nation, America will only become stronger, more prosperous, and better able to meet our shared goals, as women achieve greater access to a level playing field. The United States, as a beacon of hope and a leader in promoting women\u2019s rights, is deeply committed to empowering women both at home and abroad. Our policies will work to advance the economic empowerment of women by promoting entrepreneurship and equal access to education, employment opportunities, and training adapted to a new economic landscape. Together, America looks forward to a bright future with women in higher-wage jobs throughout high-growth sectors. America remains committed to empowering women around the world to realize their full potential within the global marketplace. And with our international partners, America will build upon the legacy of previous generations of women who have bravely broken through both economic and political barriers. It was with these goals in mind that, as one of its first initiatives, this Administration ramped up efforts to promote women in business by launching the United States-Canada Council for Advancement of Women Entrepreneurs and Business Leaders. The United States will continue to work with Canada and other partners around the globe to ensure that all women have the opportunity to succeed. Today, the United States renews its commitment to fostering economic growth and job creation by harnessing the full potential of women in our economy. This Administration will work diligently to encourage women to enter and succeed in the workforce while addressing the many barriers women still face in achieving economic success, including those that impede women\u2019s access to capital, markets, and networking opportunities. Just as the statement went live, dozens of House Democrats stood on the steps of the US Capitol to argue the threat the Trump administration posed to women\u2019s reproductive rights, women of color, Muslim women, trans women, minimum wage-earners, and women immigrants. Here\u2019s an aerial shot of the protest in New York: Hundreds have started to gather at the southeast corner of Central Park in New York City as part of the US strike for women\u2019s rights. The rally, for women\u2019s economic equality and freedom from violence will culminate in a march, all taking place in the immediate vicinity of Trump Tower. Organizers of International Women\u2019s Day called for a general strike of US women to represent \u201cthe women who have been left behind\u201d, such as women of color, Muslim women, trans women, and working-class women. \u201cEspecially surrounding Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy, there\u2019s been this idea that feminism is somehow about women becoming powerful and successful CEOs,\u201d aid Tithi Bhattacharya, an associate professor at Purdue University and one of the people who first called for the strike in a February op-ed for the Guardian. \u201cThe goal of 8 March is to make feminism a threat to the system and to talk about the feminism about the 99% rather than the 1%.\u201d Watch a livestream of US House Democrats staging a walkout to mark International Women\u2019s Day. Chirlane McCray, the first lady of New York City, marks International Women\u2019s Day: In the US, Michael Bennett of the NFL\u2019s Seattle Seahawks pledged his \u201cunconditional solidarity with the women\u2019s strike on International Women\u2019s Day\u201d: As a black man in America, I sometimes get overwhelmed and discouraged by what I see \u2014 from the police killings of unarmed black men, to the unequal educational system, to the mass incarceration of poor people of color in for-profit prisons. But when I look in my daughters\u2019 eyes, I see the courage of Harriet Tubman, the patience of Rosa Parks, the soul of Ida B. Wells, the passion of Fannie Lou Hamer and the heart of Angela Davis. I see the future. I see hope. And I\u2019m inspired because it will be women who lead the future. That is why I am writing to express my unconditional solidarity with the women\u2019s strike on International Women\u2019s Day, March 8. It would be easy for me to say that I am supporting this day of resistance because I have three daughters and I want nothing to stand in their way as they attempt to achieve their goals. I could also say that I am doing this because my wife, Pele \u2014 my best friend and soulmate \u2014 is of Samoan descent and has lived the struggle of being a woman and the daughter of immigrants. But this issue is a lot bigger than my dreams for my own family. It\u2019s about the women across the earth who are suffering: women who are less worried about a glass ceiling than they are about a collapsing floor. It\u2019s about women of color across the earth who live on less than one dollar a day. It\u2019s about all women who are subject to sexual assault and violence. Read more at the Players\u2019 Tribune. Worldwide, the gender gap \u2013 which includes employment, education, and earnings \u2013 actually got worse in 2016, according to the World Economic Forum\u2019s Global Gender Gap Report. But Toyin Saraki wrote in December that the long-term trend is toward parity: A reminder that while the status quo is unacceptable, the longer-term trend is pointed towards gender equality. And this trend is global, not simply confined to the western world. Just look at healthcare. Maternal mortality remains a mass killer in the developing world. It may not be as newsworthy as gender-based violence or as stark and immediate as disease or starvation, but it is the second biggest killer of women of reproductive age in the developing world. This is changing. Due to a concerted focus not least through the recently concluded UN Millennium Development Goals, the amount of women dying in childbirth has fallen by 45% since 1990. A staggering achievement. Gender-based development campaigns aimed at educating women have also pushed aside outmoded approaches to pregnancy and family planning, empowering women to take control of their own welfare in one of the most vulnerable periods of their lives. Improvement is also being made in education. While secondary education remains a critical problem in many developing countries, the challenge of primary school enrolment has virtually been solved. Enrolment rates globally are now on a near parity between boys and girls. And what of the workplace? The top-line figures may be bleak, but there is evidence to suggest slow change is happening. A study of 70 countries, including many in the developing world, showed that since 1995 the gender wage gap has narrowed from 28% to 20%. The gap is still far too big. But it is falling. The proportion of women not having children before the menopause has reached a record high in the last decade. In this video, women from the UK, France and Spain discuss the taboo of childlessness that they say comes from a dated societal structure, and mark International Women\u2019s Day by spotlighting female identity beyond motherhood. The tiny Balkan state of Montenegro saw hundreds protest state cuts to maternal aid. The AP reports: Showing support on the International Women\u2019s Day, hundreds have joined a protest by women in tiny Montenegro against cuts in state aid for mothers of three or more children. Financial help for some 21,500 women in Montenegro - a country of 620,000 people - has been slashed by 25 percent amid efforts to tighten public spending. About half of the women on the list are jobless. Montenegrin women have been protesting for days demanding that the government decision be reversed. Protesters on Wednesday blocked traffic outside the parliament building in downtown Podgorica, the capital, shouting \u201cthieves.\u201d Montenegro\u2019s economy has been weak despite recent progress in the Balkan country\u2019s efforts at joining NATO and the European Union. The European Parliament\u2019s Greek vice president, Dimitris Papadimoulis, greeted International Women\u2019s Day with a shocking forecast from the World Economic Forum. \u201cThe World Economic Forum predicts that the gender gap won\u2019t close entirely until 2186,\u201d Papadimoulis told the parliament in a speech replayed on Greek media. \u201cYes, you heard well, until 2186. Only in 169 years! It is more than obvious that we have to speed up this process. We have to act now.\u201d Greek women have suffered the country\u2019s ongoing economic crisis disproportionately. Although seven years of economic meltdown have narrowed a gap in the employment rate between men and women \u2013 because of soaring unemployment rates among men, not an increase in the hiring of women \u2013 Greece\u2019s employment gender gap remains well above the European Union average. In 2015, the gap was 18 percentage points in Greece, compared with 11 across the rest of the EU. In a Facebook post to mark International Women\u2019s Day, Alexis Tsipras, Greece\u2019s leftist prime minister and leader of the Syriza political party, hailed the women worldwide who \u201cbattle for equality, justice and dignity.\u201d He singled out Nadia Murrad, a former ISIS sex slave who is now a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations. Women from more than 40 countries are staging a strike from all work, paid and unpaid, to highlight women\u2019s power within global economies. But what if you can\u2019t join them? Here are other ways you can show solidarity, from wearing red to avoiding the shops for the day. A Guardian reader shares her International Women\u2019s Day protest from Switzerland: On the eve of International Women\u2019s Day, a viral video of a teacher appearing to brag to his class about domestic abuse illustrated just how pervasive Mexico\u2019s machismo culture remains. The footage showed Ram\u00f3n Urrea Bernal, a teacher at a public high school in Guadalajara, affirming that if his wife didn\u2019t consent to sex he\u2019d \u201cgrab her by the hair, give her a fucking beating [and say] \u2018Hey stupid, if you don\u2019t know how to do anything else at least open your legs.\u2019\u201d The coarse, 90-second rant concluded with Urrea declaring that he\u2019d throw his wife and children out on the street if she denied him sex. It served as a stark reminder of how many in Mexico are exposed to misogyny from an early age. As outrage spread across social media yesterday, the university that runs the school said Urrea would face administrative procedures. Urrea apologised for his language but claimed he was merely acting out an \u201cexample of domestic violence\u201d to highlight the problem. \u201cHow dare he say these things when he\u2019s supposed to educate people? How are his pupils going to treat women with teachers like him?\u201d asked Karla, a 15-year-old student from the school. \u201cInstead of leading by example he does the opposite. He\u2019s encouraging others to think like he does,\u201d added Giselle, another schoolgirl. \u201cIt\u2019s very worrying. These messages are reinforced everywhere in Mexico, in television, religion, the family and now even in schools,\u201d said Sof\u00eda Virgen, a local representative of the Latin American and Caribbean Committee for the Defence of Women\u2019s Rights. \u201cThis creates the culture of machismo that results in people committing femicides.\u201d Thousands worldwide gathered to protest the conditions for their countries\u2019 women. In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, protesters urged President Rodrigo Duterte to address the pressing problems of lack of food, jobs and peace instead of killings and violence. In Melbourne, Australia, thousands called for decolonization, and end to racism, economic justice for all women, and reproductive rights. See more. A bookstore in Cleveland kicked off International Women\u2019s Day by turning around every volume on their shelves written by a male author. It took the eight employees of Loganberry Books, a new, used and rare bookstore with a feminist bent, two hours to go through nearly 10,000 titles. The books will stay facing backwards for several weeks throughout Women\u2019s History month. Harriet Logan, the store\u2019s founder, said the act was \u201ca metaphor of silencing the male voice \u2013 at least for this month\u201d. From Heat Street: To draw attention to female authors, a Cleveland bookstore celebrated Women\u2019s History Month by turning every male-written book in the fiction room backward on its shelf. Eight of the all-female employees of Loganberry Books went through about 10,000 books, a process that took about two hours. They\u2019ll leave the books turned around for the next two weeks. \u201cPictures are loud communicators,\u201d Harriett Logan, the bookstore\u2019s founder and owner, told Heat Street. \u201cSo we are in essence not just highlighting the disparity but bringing more focus to the women\u2019s books now, because they\u2019re the only ones legible on the shelf.\u201d \u201cTo give the floor and attention to women, you need to be able to hear them,\u201d Logan told Heat Street. \u201cAnd if someone else is talking over them, that just doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d As part of a campaign to push Wall Street firms to place more women on their boards, the U.S. fund manager State Street on Tuesday installed a statue of girl opposite the famous Charging Bull. From Reuters: Although women have made some headway against the glass ceiling, State Street said one out of four of the companies that make up the Russell 3000 Index still have no female representation on their boards. \u201cToday, we are calling on companies to take concrete steps to increase gender diversity on their boards, and have issued clear guidance to help them begin to take action,\u201d State Street Global Advisors CEO Ron O\u2019Hanley said in a statement. Much the same as the charging bull, the little bronze girl by artist Kristen Visbal was put up in the wee hours of the morning as \u201cguerilla art,\u201d McNally said. But, unlike the bull, the firm discussed it with the city beforehand so that it could remain at least temporarily. \u201cWe\u2019re actively pursuing that it stays for a month,\u201d she said. \u201cIf the city decides that it should stay in perpetuity, we\u2019re absolutely on board with that.\u201d In Ireland\u2019s capital, thousands of demonstrators blocked traffic in the city center to protest the country\u2019s near-total ban on abortion. The Women\u2019s March is calling on people in Washington, DC to rally on the steps of Congress while Democratic women in the US House stage a symbolic walkout. In celebration of International Women\u2019s Day, the short film \u201cI March for ______,\u201d directed by Sam Campodonico-Ludwig, examines the growth of women\u2019s activism in the US with an intimate look at their divisions and similarities. In Argentina, a day of protest kicks off at 12pm ART with a \u201cruidazo\u201d \u2013 a widespread, noisy protest carried out by banging objects, usually pots and pans, from balconies or on sidewalks outside the home or workplace. The ruidazo will be followed by a 5pm march in the capital city of Buenos Aires from Congress to the Casa Rosada presidential palace. Argentina is home to the Ni Una Menos movement (or \u201cNot One Less,\u201d meaning not one more woman lost to male violence) a grassroots response to Argentina\u2019s high rates of deadly domestic violence. From 2008 to 2016, the rate at which Argentinian women are murdered shot up 78%. In 2012, Argentina passed a law in 2012 that recognized domestic violence homicides and honor killings as \u201cfemicide\u201d. There were 322 victims of femicide last year in Argentina, or one woman murdered every 30 hours. So far in 2017, the violence has not abated. Casa del Encuentro NGO, a safe home for victims of male violence, estimates that this year, one woman has died every 18 hours as a result of intimate partner or family violence. Today\u2019s 5pm march will be titled \u201cWe\u2019re Not All Here,\u201d in reference to the women lives have been lost. More school districts in the US are shutting down as the #DayWithoutAWoman campaign leaves them short-handed. Chapel Hill-Carrboro City Schools in North Carolina, Alexandria Virginia Public Schools in Virginia, and now, Prince George\u2019s County in Maryland: Several Prince George\u2019s County schools are still serving lunch for students who rely on its school lunch program. In the US House of Representatives, Democratic women are planning to stage a walkout Wednesday afternoon in solidarity with the women\u2019s strike. Several of them will speak in honor of International Women\u2019s Day, the Hill reports, and then, shortly after noon, they will walk out. \u201cI think it\u2019s important women in Congress show our solidarity,\u201d Rep. Lois Frankel, of Florida, told the Hill. Frankel helped arrange the walkout. The women won\u2019t be missing any votes, such as a vote on a defense spending bill that is expected to pass. \u201cWe considered a lot of different options, but our feeling is that there is so much mischief going on in this Congress that we cannot turn our backs,\u201d Frankel said. \u201cWe think it would actually be sort of the opposite of what we\u2019re trying to accomplish.\u201d International Women\u2019s Day is getting underway in the Americas. In the US, some media companies are already participating in the women\u2019s strike, or #DayWithoutAWoman. MTV\u2019s social media accounts are on autopilot: And the news sites Bustle and Romper have gone dark completely: For 24 hours, we will not be creating any new content on either of our sites or on any of our sites\u2019 social channels. Because, quite simply, without women, there is no Bustle. There is no Romper. Without our editorial team, which is 97 percent female, we would be unable to produce a site that aims to provide support and a megaphone for women to express how they\u2019re feeling about the world. And there\u2019s no time like the present to prove just how important those women\u2019s voices are to the world \u2014 to media, to business, and beyond. Some of its staff will spend the day volunteering for domestic violence shelters, food banks, and \u201cother charities that reach out to women and marginalized communities in need.\u201d International Women\u2019s Day events will be continuing throughout the globe today, and I am now handing over to my colleague Molly Redden in New York. Thank you to everyone who has tweeted, commented and emailed - and apologies to those I didn\u2019t get time to answer or include. We still want your stories: You can contribute via Guardian Witness here Tweet Molly on @mtredden Across the north of England, pressure is building for more women to be celebrated in statue form. In many cities and towns, the only women immortalised in stone or marble are either Queen Victoria, naked nymphs or other allegorical figures. In Carlisle, sculptor Hazel Reeves has just been commissioned to produce a statue of two \u201ccracker packers\u201d \u2014 female workers at the local McVities biscuit factory. Reeves has recently been shortlisted or the Emmeline Pankhurst statue commission for St Peter\u2019s Square, Manchester, and is well-known for her seven foot bronze sculpture of Sir Nigel Gresley in King\u2019s Cross Station. In Leeds, local MP Rachel Reeves is leading the call for a new female statue to join Henry Moore\u2019s naked reclining lady outside the city art gallery. Possible subjects include Olympic gold boxer Nicola Adams, social reformer Mary Gawthorpe, novelist Barbara Taylor Bradford or cycling hero Beryl Burton. Italy is marking International Women\u2019s Day by giving women free entry to all museum and cultural sites. But on a much more sober note, Italian president Sergio Mattarella used a speech in honour of IWD at the Presidential Palace in Rome to highlight the \u201ctragic, disturbing social emergency\u201d of femicide in Italy following a raft of high-profile murders. According to statistics released late last year, more than 100 women are killed in Italy each year in acts that are considered to be gender-related, in most cases by a woman\u2019s partner or ex-partner. It is estimated that another 3.5m women have been victims of stalking but that only 22 per cent of those victims have reported the incidents or sought help, according to Istat, the national statistics agency. Mattarella thanked women for their \u201cdaily and often strenuous action in favour of a fairer society, more welcoming, more united and integrated\u201d. Impressive smack down from Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor of people who have dismissed today\u2019s strike for International Women\u2019s Day as \u201cprivileged\u201d. There have been some who have suggested that in calling for women to \u201cstrike\u201d we are jeopardising those who do not have the \u201cluxury\u201d to call off work. Indeed, organisers of the women\u2019s strike have even been described as privileged. This is as ridiculous as it condescending to both the organisers and working-class women, who apparently are not viewed as capable of making decisions about their own activity on 8 March. Aside from ensuring there are multiple ways for women and their supporters to participate in the strike \u2013 including taking part in actions at work such as wearing red, as a gesture of solidarity \u2013 we have been inspired by the genuine grassroots nature that is animating cities, colleges, and communities across the country. ... In total, there are more than 60 events planned as part of today\u2019s strike. We have no idea how many people will participate. I don\u2019t expect the same millions who came out on 21 January to take part. But I do suspect thousands will be involved, and that is significant. The point was never to just hold a successful event, but to begin to knit together a network of ordinary people who can revive the struggles for racial and economic justice, sexual liberation and reproductive freedom that have always been at the nexus of the struggle for women\u2019s liberation. We have a world to win, and the women\u2019s strike is an important step in that process. AFP are reporting that a group of feminist activists have been detained in Moscow, after protesting by the Kremlin walls with a banner reading \u201cMen have been in power 200 years, down with them!\u201d AFP reports: OVD Info, a website that monitors detentions of activists, wrote that seven people were detained including two journalists from Novaya Gazeta opposition newspaper and a photographer and taken to a police station for questioning. Rights lawyer Mari Davtyan wrote on Facebook that eight had been detained including journalists. One of the detained activists, performance artist Yekaterina Nenasheva, posted a video of the protest on Facebook showing the activists standing on top of an artificial grotto in a park by the Kremlin walls, holding smoke flares. \u201cMoscow and St Petersburg feminists who seized the Kremlin congratulate you on March 8,\u201d Nenasheva wrote. The activists\u2019 banner referred to the fact that Russia\u2019s last female ruler was Catherine the Great, who died in 1796, more than 200 years ago. TV Rain independent channel reported that the women also carried banners reading \u201cA woman for president\u201d and \u201cWe are the majority.\u201d The protest resembled those by punk group Pussy Riot, who in 2012 lit flares and sang a song about President Vladimir Putin on a platform on Red Square. March 8 is a public holiday in Russia but is mainly celebrated by giving flowers and chocolates to women rather than stressing the need for gender equality. In a video address to the nation\u2019s women, Putin said that he and other men \u201cwill do all we can so that our beloved women are lavished with care and attention and smile more often.\u201d The UK government has announced \u00a320m of funding for services to support women and children who are victims of domestic violence in today\u2019s budget. Polly Neate, Chief Executive of Women\u2019s Aid, welcomed the \u201cdesperately needed\u201d boost to the sector: It\u2019s not a moment too soon, as Women\u2019s Aid\u2019s most recent national survey found that a third of domestic abuse services are running with no dedicated funding. The Prime Minister\u2019s strong commitment to helping survivors of domestic abuse is a fitting message for International Women\u2019s Day. With two women a week on average being killed by a partner or ex-partner in England and Wales, something has to change. When I left my flat for work this morning, my male neighbour from downstairs made a point of congratulating me on International Women\u2019s Day and warmly shook my hand. The day has more significance for ordinary citizens here than it does in the UK - most particularly in eastern parts, where under communism women - almost all of whom had jobs - were feted on this day, with flowers or being given time off work, sometimes even meals or drinks laid on by the boss, etc. Almost 30 years after the collapse of communism, this still happens in some workplaces, though the tradition is dying out. It\u2019s considered important enough that editorials in several leading German newspapers choose focus on it, arguing that recent global developments underline how we need IWD more than ever at a time when women\u2019s rights are so under attack. The liberal S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung from Munich writes: \u201cThe rise of populists in Germany, Russia, Turkey, America, Hungary, France and Poland has changed everything. They have brought back an image of women which we had thought had long been overcome. In Russia domestic violence will in future be treated as a much milder crime than it was previously, despite the fact that every year 12,000 women are battered to death by their partners. We should be under no illusion - despite regional differences, rights are being eroded in a similarly retrograde and discriminatory way. Women\u2019s rights are not collateral damage in the fight for the greater good, they are a barometer, a symptom of the internal state of a society. According to The Leipziger Volkszeitung: \u201cTrump, Putin and Erdogan are currently competing with each other in front of all of us for the position of biggest macho. What should we be doing to counteract this particularly difficult to deal with type of man?...Our motto should be \u2018the world needs strong women\u2019. The Lausitzer Rundschau, from Cottbus (like Leipzig in the former communist east) comments: \u201cthose who wants to change something but trusts in politics to do this, will wait forever. It was never a comfortable thing to fight for rights and freedoms. Dear women, you must become active yourselves, strengthen your networks and stand up together for your common interests. And we men should be your allies in this, and not just on this day.\u201d This is wonderful footage of the Suffragettes marching on London in 1915 for the right to vote and equal pay from the British Film Insitute. Some campaigners have argued that Spain still overlooks the massive contribution that women have made to society, culture and arts. As part of Madrid\u2019s belated efforts to honour some of the women who have been overshadowed by their more famous male peers, the city\u2019s mayor will unveil a plaque today to commemorate the Lyceum Women\u2019s Club, a meeting place for some of the leading intellectuals of pre-civil war Spain. The drive to remember their lives and contributions with plaques is being led by Nuria Capdevila-Arg\u00fcelles, a professor of Hispanic and gender studies at the University of Exeter. Capdevila-Arg\u00fcelles, and her film-maker collaborator, Tania Ballo, have so far provided the city council with research on more than 15 women, including the journalist, actor, writer and diplomat Isabel Oyarz\u00e1bal, the lawyer and politician Victoria Kent and the poet Ernestina de Champourc\u00edn. \u201cPeople, both Spanish and British, have written about Spain\u2019s ghosts, but the most important ghosts are the women \u2013 the invisible 50%,\u201d Capdevila-Arg\u00fcelles told the Guardian recently. \u201cThe role of history and an awareness of our past is utterly fundamental. It\u2019s about learning about our diversity, our cultural heritage, about learning about our first attempt at genuine democracy at the beginning of the 20th century, which failed. We need to learn from our past; it\u2019s there as a lesson.\u201d This is a fascinating tale of the history of women in science for International Women\u2019s Day. Rousing words: [E]ven though it may increasingly feel like the end of the road for those enlightenment values that people around the world will march for on 22 April, as long as we show up, we have hope. A quote normally attributed to the anthropologist Margaret Mead puts it best: \u201cNever doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.\u201d More than 500 women in Thailand, Philippines and India participated in a global solidarity strike for their rights today, according to The Asia Pacific Forum on Women Law and Development (APWLD). APWLD\u2019s Regional Coordinator Kate Lappin said: This action is part of ongoing efforts to increase the power of global solidarity strikes as we believe solidarity is the only possible antidote to the growing authoritarianism, deepening inequalities, runaway climate change and sexist leadership the world is experiencing. Edna Velarde of Amihan National Federation of Peasant Women , Philippines said: The peasant women joined today\u2019s strike to call on the Duterte administration to turn down neoliberal policies detrimental to the country and fulfill its promises to the Filipino people to provide land to the tillers, food on the table and respect for human rights. Elizabeth Khumallambam of Nari Shakti Manch, India said: Women working in unorganized sector continue to face discrimination - unequal wages, sexual harassment at workplaces, absence of social security and maternity benefits. In voicing these suppressions, our strength lies in solidarities across spectrums. This is an absolute must read for International Women\u2019s Day, six inspiring activists share their secrets about how to win a feminist battle. This from Leymah Gwobee, part of a group of mothers ended Liberia\u2019s civil war via non-violent action, including a sex strike: We were ordinary mothers who decided it was no longer enough to beg for peace. Instead, we came together to demand peace, justice, equality and inclusion in political decision-making. We used our bodies, broken by hunger, poverty, desperation and destitution, to stare down the barrel of the gun. Fourteen years later, we can comfortably say that we did the unimaginable. Sobering news of a domestic stabbing in Wolverhampton in the UK on IWD. It is believed a man attacked two women, killing one and critically injuring another before killing himself. According to Women\u2019s Aid on average two women are killed by their partner or ex-partner every week in England and Wales. This from my colleague Jamie Grierson: Two people have died following a domestic stabbing at a block of flats, including the attacker, in a Wolverhampton incident that sparked a significant emergency services response including armed police and air ambulances. Police were called to a block of flats in Leasowes Drive, in the Merry Hill area of the city, at around 9.45am where it is believed a man attacked two women before inflicting stab injuries on himself, West Midlands police said. Officers used stun grenades as they stormed the flat in a bid to distract and detain the knifeman, the force said. A woman believed to be in her 30s died at the scene while the male suspect, also believed to be in his 30s, was pronounced dead a short time later, WMP said. Nadja Sayej has written a lovely piece about the Iranian TV that is promoting women\u2019s rights. Worth a read this IWD. Here\u2019s a taster: \u2018Oops, I did it again,\u201d was Maryam Faghihimani\u2019s reaction when the Iranian regime accused her TV show of the horrible crime of promoting women\u2019s rights. She immediately took to Facebook, explaining to her friends that a state news site had also blurred out her bare arms and legs, to protect their honour. \u201cI am humble and proud of those crimes and sin,\u201d she added, \u201cand will continue my efforts.\u201d Satellite TV is becoming a powerful way for Iranian women to connect with the wider world. Over 70% of Iranian households have satellites to watch international television, and one of the most popular stations is the London-based Manoto TV. A liberal Persian channel with over three million Facebook followers, Manoto airs reality TV, cooking shows \u2013 and now, its first ever women\u2019s talk show, a Middle Eastern version of the American smash-hit The View. The show \u2013 Samte No (which translates as New Direction) \u2013 is a huge step forward in a country where YouTube and other anti-Islamic websites are blocked and it is banned for women to dance, perform music on stage, ride bikes, watch male sports teams, wear leggings or reject their husband\u2019s sexual advances. \u201cWearing makeup or even nail polish, you\u2019ll pay a fine,\u201d explains Faghihimani. \u201cHijab is mandatory and any tight outfits will result in arrest by the moral police.\u201d This from GuardianWitness: Kripa Joshi, an illustrator from Nepal, is celebrating International Women\u2019s Day with five generations of women in her family. She is also the creator of the character Miss Moti who emerged from Kripa\u2019s struggle with weight and whose name means a big woman in Nepali. To mark today she\u2019s highlighting some Miss Moti-vational messages. Feminists striking, marching and wearing red in solidarity for International Women\u2019s Day today will surely be delighted to hear that US president Donald Trump has tweeted to mark the day. For fun, here is a truncated selection of the times Trump has been accused of misogyny: Bragged he could \u201cgrab [women] by the pussy\u201d and kiss and grope them because he is a star. Briefly advocated \u201csome form of punishment\u201d for women who had abortions Attacked the Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly, calling her a \u201cbimbo\u201d incapable of objectivity when there was \u201cblood coming out of her whatever\u201d - widely interpreted as a thinly veiled reference to her menstrual cycle. As Kelly pointed out Trump has, at different times, \u201ccalled women you don\u2019t like fat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals.\u201d Critics reacted accordingly: Never shy of getting in on the action, singer Lily Allen tweeted: This year\u2019s International Women\u2019s Day has huge resonance in Warsaw and across Poland. Today women have gathered outside the Law and Justice headquarters to protest at continuing discrimination against women and to stand up for women\u2019s reproductive rights. Polish women attracted worldwide attention in October during the so-called \u2018Black Protest\u2019 against a blanket ban on abortion under consideration in the Polish parliament that would have prohibited terminations under almost all circumstances, including of pregnancies resulting from rape and incest. The government beat a hasty retreat in the face of the protests, but campaigners warn that Polish women remain under threat from the government and its relationship with hardline elements of the Polish Catholic Church - a feeling shared by many believers and non-believers alike. As Jaga, 34, told the Guardian: Whether you have experienced childbirth, or you know someone whose child died after delivery, or you know someone having to raise a disabled child alone, women are sharing stories. These are not topics you raise at the dinner table at Christmas, but thanks to the abortion bill, people started to talk about them. It is the first IWM since many Polish women found their voice, and won. There is now a palpable sense that if and when change comes to Poland, it will have been its women that won it. The UK government\u2019s department of international development are having a busy International Women\u2019s Day and have made this short video highlighting the work of women who manifest this year\u2019s theme of #BeBoldForChange. International Development Secretary Priti Patel said: We all know that women are part of the solution; that women\u2019s participation in education, health, politics and peace building increases the chances of a more prosperous and stable future. Yet we must also remain alive to the many challenges that still come before girls and women to have an equal part in this story. So we stand with them all, in every way. Seventeen women have been killed so far this year by their partners or ex-partners in Spain, writes my colleague Sam Jones in Madrid. The figure means that more women have died as a result of gender-based violence in the first four months of 2017 than died over the course of last year, when the total stood at 11. Statistics also show that this year has already overtaken 2008 (15 deaths) as the worst year on record for such violence. The situation has prompted protests and led a group of women to go on a month-long hunger strike in the famous Puerta del Sol square in central Madrid. The strikers ended their protest on Tuesday but vowed to press on with their 25-point plan to tackle gender-based violence. The German composer Fanny Mendelssohn is finally due to be recognised in Britain as a musician with the talent to match her brother, the more famous Felix, when a piano sonata long attributed to him is performed at lunchtime today. The British premiere of Fanny\u2019s Easter Sonata which will be broadcast on BBC Radio 3 at 1pm - is as much a tribute to the German woman, who wrote it 140 years ago, as it is to the many women composers over the ages who have not received the recognition they deserve. The manuscript of \u2018Easter Sonata\u2019 was first identified as being Fanny\u2019s work in 2010, when an American academic, Angela Mace Christian, tracked it down to a private archive in France and had it analysed. Fanny was only 23 when she wrote it. She had referred to the piece in her diary, including the fact she had played it at home in April 1829. But like most of the 500 works she wrote, it never came to public attention.Pianist Sofya Gulyak will resurrect the work at the Royal College of Music. Fanny\u2019s great great great granddaughter, Shiela Hayman, tells her story in The Guardian today. In France a \u201cstrike\u201d called for by feminist organisations is due to start at 3h40 this afternoon. This is the symbolic time after which French women are considered to work for free when their wages are compared with male colleagues. In Paris there will be a gathering at Place de la R\u00e9publique at 2pm followed by a march to Place de l\u2019opera at 5.30. There are protests in cities across France. But a recent controversy suggests France still has a long way to go before achieving gender equality. Green party MP Denis Baupin was last year investigated after claims of sexual aggression and harassment against four women. The women were, according to investigators, convincing witnesses, giving \u201cmeasured declarations that did not change and were corroborated... about events some of which could be considered criminal\u201d. One of the women is a French MP for the Green/Ecology party, one is the party secretary, one a local mayor and one a regional councillor. However, the case was dropped because it was out of time as the alleged harassment happened in the late 1990s.Now, Baupin, 54, has said he is going to sue the women for making \u201cfalse accusations\u201d. Russian president Vladimir Putin has issued a gushing message to the women of Russia, praising their \u201cbeauty and vitality\u201d and, of course, their timekeeping abilities. In a statement Putin said: Dear women: mothers, grandmothers, daughters, wives, friends, our nearest and dearest ones, please accept my heartfelt congratulations on International Women\u2019s Day! You fill this world with beauty and vitality, giving warmth and comfort, cordiality and harmony with your tenderness and generosity of spirit. You care day and night for your children, grandchildren and your family. Even today, on International Women\u2019s Day, you are still caught up in your routine, working tirelessly, always on time. We often ask ourselves, how do they manage it all? Many have pointed out that Putin has recently signed into law a controversial amendment that decriminalises some forms of domestic violence. On International Women\u2019s day the president of the European Parliament hhas vowed that a Polish lawmaker will be punished for sexist comments he made last week. EU parliament President Antonio Tajani said that he intends to bring a \u201cswift conclusion\u201d to the probe into the remarks of radical right-winger Janusz Korwin-Mikke at the legislature and promised \u201ca penalty commensurate with the gravity of the offence.\u201d During a debate on the pay gap between men and women Korwin-Mikke said: \u201cOf course women must earn less than men because they are weaker, they are smaller, they are less intelligent. They must earn less, that\u2019s all.\u201d He could face sanctions such as a reprimand, a temporary suspension or a fine. Hopefully a big one. In the Middle East the Gulf Centre for Human Rights (GCHR) is marking International Women\u2019s Day with a timely reminder of the need for greater protection for women human rights defenders in the region. On IWD a march will take take in Lebanon, organised by the WHRDs Middle East and North Africa Coalition. Here is a sobering reminder of the dangers and harassment people fighting for equality face in many countries throughout the world. In 2017, hundreds of women are still in captivity, detention, exile, many are under surveillance, travel bans and judicial harassment, while others are subjected to torture, disappearance or murder as a result of their human rights activities. In conflict zones, targeting women increases in parallel with the increase of violence, where sexual violence against girls and women is used as a tool of war, human trafficking, and early marriage plus other types of targetings puts women at greater risk. The organisation points out that women in Iraq, Iraqi Kurdistan, Syria, and Yemen are targeted daily just for being women. According to the GCHR they work \u201cunder government surveillance, risk of persecution, detention and torture for demanding their basic rights such as social rights in Iran, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, and political rights in Bahrain, while others are struggling to have a voice in shrinking civil spaces in countries including the United Arab Emirates and Qatar.\u201d The organisation points to 2017 as a year of momentous change for women in the middle east: Despite all odds, women refuse to be submissive, oppressed, marginalised, used and excluded; instead they have found strength in solidarity, and collaborative work. The beginning of this year showed how women can mobilise their efforts to refuse patriarchy and challenge the status quo. If you needed any more reason to love the small but powerful nation of Iceland, here\u2019s another: the country has just become the first country in the world to require companies to prove they offer equal pay regardless of gender, ethnicity, sexuality and nationality. This from the ministry of Social Affairs and Equality: The certification requires companies with more than 25 employees to not only offer equal pay for equal work, but also equal pay for work of the same value. The Equal Pay Standard, on which the certification requirements are based, does this by assessing a company\u2019s pay policies, classification of jobs according to equal value and wage research on the basis of the classification, as well as formalizing policies and processes related to pay decisions. The move aims to help the country achieve its aim of eradicating the country\u2019s gender gap by 2022 Iceland\u2019s Minister of Social Affairs and Equality, \u00deorsteinn V\u00edglundsson said: As a country we set ourselves the challenge to eradicate the gender pay gap by 2022 but, despite taking steps such as introducing dedicated paid leave for new dads and 40% quotas for women on boards of larger companies, we have not made the progress we would have wished. It is the right time to do something radical about this issue. We want to show the world that eradicating the gender pay gap is an achievable goal and we hope other nations will follow suit in adopting the Equal Pay Standard in years to come. Iceland has a long and proud history of leading the way on gender equality. For the past eight years it has topped the World Economic Forum\u2019s gender gap index. The Economist recently named Iceland the world\u2019s best place for working women \u2013 in comparison, the UK came in at No. 24. You can read the joyous story of 90% of Icelandic women going on strike in 1975 here. The UK parliament Women and Equalities Select Committee have done a video encouraging women to get into politics. The chair Maria Miller told me for a IWD story last week, that the WESC has been made permanent. Also, she believed having a female prime minister - coupled with MPs from both sides of the divide being prepared to work for common goals - was making a quiet difference to improving policy on women\u2019s issues. It\u2019s worth following @5050Parliament for the campaign for better female representation in the UK parliament. If you want to take one small action for IWD, you can sign their petition here: An example of how people are using this year\u2019s IWD to fight for political goals can be seen in Ireland. where women are preparing to strike and march in a bid to push the government to call a referendum on reproductive rights. People are gathering on the bridge in Dublin at 12.30. You can read more about the push to repeal the 8th amendment, which amounts to a constitutional ban on abortion in Ireland, by my colleague Henry McDonald.

Thanks to Rob Shaw who has directed me to the resplendent front page of Wikipedia today, which - among other fabulous women - is celebrating the achievements of top scouser Bessie Braddock. It\u2019s worth checking out. In Sheffield in the UK protesters are using the Women of Steel statue [see my colleague Helen Pidd\u2019s previous story on the statue here] to voice their opposition to the new Bishop of Sheffield\u2019s views on the ordination of women. Hello from London! And happy International Women\u2019s Day to all. Huge thanks to the incredible Claire Phipps who has put in a sterling shift for the sisterhood from Australia. I\u2019ll be here for much of the day and I would love to hear your stories and see pictures of how you are marking the day. Are you striking? Wearing a specific colour? Get in touch! I\u2019m on alexandra.topping@theguardian.com and on twitter @lexytopping I\u2019m handing over the blog now to my colleague Lexy Topping in London \u2013 she\u2019ll continue to update you on events, protests and everything else as International Women\u2019s Day continues its way around the globe. Thanks for reading and for your comments and contributions \u2013 do keep them coming. A key feature of 2017\u2019s International Women\u2019s Day is the call for \u201ca day without women\u201d \u2013 for women to take the day off work (paid and unpaid, at home and out of the home); to avoid shopping for the day,\u201cwith exceptions for small, women- and minority-owned businesses\u201d; and to wear red in solidarity. In America, the call to strike has been led by the organisers of the Women\u2019s March, which took place across the US (and the world) the day after Trump\u2019s inauguration. A group of feminist activists and academics wrote recently in the Guardian about the need to strike: The idea is to mobilise women, including trans women, and all who support them in an international day of struggle \u2013 a day of striking, marching, blocking roads, bridges, and squares, abstaining from domestic, care and sex work, boycotting, calling out misogynistic politicians and companies, striking in educational institutions. These actions are aimed at making visible the needs and aspirations of those whom lean-in feminism ignored: women in the formal labor market, women working in the sphere of social reproduction and care, and unemployed and precarious working women. In embracing a feminism for the 99%, we take inspiration from the Argentinian coalition Ni Una Menos. Violence against women, as they define it, has many facets: it is domestic violence, but also the violence of the market, of debt, of capitalist property relations, and of the state; the violence of discriminatory policies against lesbian, trans and queer women; the violence of state criminalization of migratory movements; the violence of mass incarceration; and the institutional violence against women\u2019s bodies through abortion bans and lack of access to free healthcare and free abortion. But Guardian columnist Lindy West, speaking on Australian TV this week, while agreeing that \u201cprotest is most effective when it disrupts people\u2019s lives\u201d, echoed concerns of others who are cautious about the proposed strike: It would be tremendously effective if we could mobilise every single woman in the world \u2026 A concern for me, as a very privileged, financially stable white woman who works from home \u2026 it\u2019s very easy for me to say yes, everyone should go on strike but I want to be very cognisant of the fact there are very many women who cannot afford to lose one day\u2019s worth of pay, let alone risk their job. You can find details of strikes and other protests taking place around the world from Australia to Uruguay via the links on this page. And here are some ways you can take part if you\u2019re not striking: Brendan Cox, whose wife Jo Cox was murdered last year, has shared this picture of the Labour MP for International Women\u2019s Day: In the UK, International Women\u2019s Day coincides \u2013 or collides \u2013 with the Budget. Labour peer Shami Chakrabarti argues that austerity is a feminist issue, with women more likely to be single parents, earn less and work part-time than their male counterparts. It\u2019s 19 November, since you ask. If you\u2019d like to hear more about how International Men\u2019s Day is on 19 November, can I suggest you follow comedian Richard Herring on Twitter, as he endures his annual feat of replying to all the people wondering when International Men\u2019s Day is. Here\u2019s what Herring wrote for the Guardian on International Men\u2019s Day in 2015: International Women\u2019s Day is on 8 March: 24 hours (of the 8,760 annually available) set aside to celebrate women and all of their achievements. And people get furious about it. Surely, you might think, you could only be cross about it because that definitely isn\u2019t enough time to celebrate the achievements of over than 50% of the population. But no \u2026 So for the last two International Women\u2019s Days I have tried to highlight this stupidity. I have got up early, logged on to Twitter and searched for the phrase \u201cinternational men\u2019s day\u201d, found every single person who has tweeted the question and responded to them all individually: \u201cIt\u2019s 19 November.\u201d There are thousands to get through. It goes on relentlessly, for hours and hours, but I try to get to them all because to see the same moronic question asked over and over again by people (who don\u2019t even think just to check Google to make sure they\u2019re not making an arse of themselves) is very funny, and shows exactly why an international women\u2019s day is necessary. Incidentally, nobody tweets me back to say: \u201cOh thanks for the information. I was wondering when it was.\u201d Almost like they don\u2019t want to know the answer to their own question. My hope is that if I can spend a day a year dealing with this issue, then that means that everyone else can get on with making International Women\u2019s Day about celebrating women and not complaining about the supposed raw deal men get. So I let men know that they do have a day if they want to celebrate themselves. Though not many of them do when it comes along, weirdly. On 24 October 1975, the women of Iceland did no housework, to protest against their feeble, 5% representation in parliament. They technically went on everything-strike, but since their democratic exclusion was mirrored in the workplace, this functionally meant they stopped looking after their children and doing the washing-up (those who did have jobs worked in schools and nurseries, so those had to close as well). A staggering 90% of women took part, after the genius move of renaming it, not a strike, but a \u201cWomen\u2019s Day Off\u201d, dressing up stridency as me-time. Men had to take their children to work, which gave the event its other name: The Long Friday. This action changed the face of Icelandic politics, delivering to Europe its first female president, Vigd\u00eds Finnbogad\u00f3ttir, five years later. But its significance in the wider feminist landscape is subtler, since that tension of where you situate domestic labour in the fight for equality is, if anything, more pronounced now than it was then. Feminism at home sounds a lot like nagging. The strike was underpinned by a movement, the radical Red Stockings in Iceland, and sister organisations across Europe making the case for paid housework. We now broadly reject domestic responsibilities as innately female, so would struggle to galvanise action around them. Yet we still do most of them (statistically, I mean; I don\u2019t personally, I am a slut) and they are still unpaid. I struggle to see much victory in this turn of events. If you want victory, go to Poland: \u201cThe so-called Black Protest last October,\u201d feminist activist Katarzyna Bielinska tells me, \u201cwas provoked by an attempt to tighten already the extremely restrictive abortion law in Poland by introducing an even more barbarian bill, banning abortion totally, making a woman who aborts liable for five years\u2019 imprisonment, criminalising miscarriage and blocking prenatal foetus investigation and treatment.\u201d Tens of thousands of women went on strike, or \u2013 this detail pleases me \u2013 went to work but dressed in black, and didn\u2019t do anything. More than 140 cities, towns and municipalities were profoundly affected, especially public-sector work. \u201cThe success was huge and unexpected,\u201d Bielinska says. \u201cThe governing Law and Justice party rejected the bill three days after.\u201d Today is on course to be one of the most political International Women\u2019s Days in history, Alexandra Topping and Molly Redden report: From Thailand to Poland, the United States to Australia, the first Global Women\u2019s Strike will see action on both the industrial and domestic fronts, with participants keen to show solidarity with an energised global women\u2019s movement. \u201cWe are united, we are international \u2013 and we are everywhere,\u201d said Klementyna Suchanow, a Poland-based organiser of the Global Women\u2019s Strike, adding that the walkout would put governments and institutions under pressure by giving women a voice that has long been ignored. \u201cWe are an army of women across the globe and we are no longer asking to be listened to. The world is being forced to listen to us.\u201d The theme for 2017\u2019s International Women\u2019s Day \u2013 which celebrates the social, economic, cultural and political achievements of women \u2013 is #BeBoldForChange. Organisers of the Global Women\u2019s Strike have joined forces with coordinators of the Women\u2019s March and hundreds of human rights and women\u2019s campaigners to capitalise on momentum in the movement in the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s election. Up to 2 million people around the world marched for equality in January the day after his inauguration. The Women\u2019s March \u2013 which now has organisers across 200 cities in 80 countries \u2013 has called on supporters not to engage in paid or unpaid labour and only spend money in small and female-owned businesses. Recognising that the poor financial situation and rigid work laws mean many will not be able to take part in a physical strike, organisers are urging supporters to wear red, a colour historically associated with the labour movement, in solidarity. In other countries women will wear black, or different colours, while the focus on issues from femicide to abortion will be decided in each nation. The relationship between feminism and capitalism is a twisty one, but in the US Wall Street is making its own International Women\u2019s Day statement with this statue of a girl facing down the charging bull. Reuters reports: Placing the diminutive, school-aged girl in front of the massive bull on the eve of International Women\u2019s Day was a way of calling attention to the lack of gender diversity on corporate boards and the pay gap of women working in financial services, a spokeswoman for Wall Street firm State Street Global Advisors said. \u201cA lot of people talk about gender diversity, but we really felt we had to take it to a broader level,\u201d said Anne McNally. Although women have made some headway against the glass ceiling, State Street said one out of four of the companies that make up the Russell 3000 Index still have no female representation on their boards. The little bronze girl by artist Kristen Visbal was put up in the wee hours of the morning as \u201cguerilla art\u201d, McNally said. But the firm discussed it with the city beforehand so that it could remain at least temporarily. \u201cWe\u2019re actively pursuing that it stays for a month,\u201d she said. \u201cIf the city decides that it should stay in perpetuity, we\u2019re absolutely on board with that.\u201d In Greece, the Eurozone\u2019s weakest member state, the governing left-wing Syriza party has issued a rousing statement to mark International Womens\u2019 Day. After eight years of economic crisis and depression-era poverty, the ruling Syriza party elected to mark the day tapping into the radical rhetoric that first swept it to power. Women, it said, were not only poorer wherever they lived, they were paid less than men for the same work, while the violence often perpetuated against them was \u201cthe most widespread crime in the world and harmed the life, dignity and freedom of half the world\u2019s population\u201d. Applauding the protest action women had taken over the past year, \u201cfrom the squares of Argentina to those in European cities and Turkey\u201d, women, it said, had marched against gender violence, racism, sexism, Donald Trump\u2019s misogynist agenda and the policies and effects of austerity. The 8th of March is a reminder that in our country female unemployment, especially among the young, has soared. The shrinking of the social state brought about by the politics of austerity over the last decade has further encumbered women regarding care for children and old people. Under the stewardship of Greece\u2019s first ever leftist government, legislation outlining the equality of the sexes had been drafted and would soon be put to parliament and sexist language removed from all public documents, it added. Less than 19% of the 300-seat Greek parliament is represented by female MPs. In Afghanistan, Reporters Without Borders says it will today hold an opening ceremony for the country\u2019s first Centre for the Protection of Afghan Women Journalists, in Kabul. Afghan journalist Farida Nikzad will head the new centre, which says its aim is \u201cto assist and protect women journalists, especially those working in remote parts of Afghanistan, who are more vulnerable\u201d. Nikzad explains: The creation of this centre is intended to send a strong message not only to Afghan women journalists, but also to all of the country\u2019s women. We want to support women journalists both in war zones and within the news organisations for which they work, to defend both their rights and their physical safety. To that end, we need the government and media owners to commit to do their part in what is a key battle for Afghan society. The centre says it is already working with 10 female journalists, five of them in conflict zones. Reporters Without Borders says many women have been forced to give up work in the media due to violence: In some regions, there are no longer any women journalists at all. Three of the 10 journalists and media workers killed in 2016 were women. Thirteen women journalists and media workers (including five foreigners) have been killed since 2001, and at least 10 have had to flee the country. Afghanistan is ranked 120th out of 180 countries in RSF\u2019s 2016 World Press Freedom Index. Today is International Women\u2019s Day. There is much to celebrate when it comes to progress for women throughout the world. There is also much to lament, both in relation to what still needs to be done and where the gains we have made risk going backwards. Stillbirth, however, is standing still. The incidence of stillbirth is the same today as it has been for decades. Very little money or attention goes into research to reduce or prevent stillbirth. Why? Stillbirth struggles on two fronts. One, stillbirth is a thing that happens inside a woman\u2019s body. In a male-dominated world, stillbirth is easily relegated as a private tragedy rather than as a public health matter. Two, stillbirth is not a cause feminists want to champion. Even though stillbirth is a tragedy for thousands of women each year, most feminists don\u2019t want to talk about the death of a baby inside its mother\u2019s womb. Many feminists get uneasy about anything that gets a bit too close to abortion rights. So let\u2019s be clear: stillbirth happens to women who want to be mothers, who have chosen to take a baby to term. It has nothing to do with abortion. Many mothers of stillborn babies are pro-choice and would not seek to restrict women\u2019s access to abortion services. If feminists believe women\u2019s choices should be respected, then there is nothing to fear from recognising a woman\u2019s choice to be a mother. There is everything to gain from demanding that society take seriously a public health problem that devastates six women and their babies a day in Australia. Found a hidden feminist book? Do let us know where and what! It\u2019s estimated more than 1,000 early years workers walked off the job today at 3.20pm \u2013 the time that women in Australia effectively start working for free. Early childhood educator Julie Lofts said she wanted the government to recognise the value of her work. After 18 years in the industry, she said she continued to live paycheque to paycheque, and had struggled to raise two sons balancing bills and \u201csome quality of life\u201d. \u201cI should be paid a lot more than what I get now,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t do this for the money, I do it because it\u2019s a job that I love. But I\u2019m not paid according to my qualifications.\u201d Carley Adams, an educator at the same centre, had been \u201cshocked\u201d to discover how little she would earn when she joined the sector six years ago. \u201cIt\u2019s my career, it\u2019s not just a job I come to every day \u2026 When you find something you love to do it\u2019s hard to leave it, but if I don\u2019t get a pay rise I would have to leave eventually, which is sad.\u201d India\u2019s minister for women has sparked anger and ridicule after saying female students need curfews to protect them from their own \u201chormonal outbursts\u201d. AFP reports: Many Indian universities inflict curfews on women while allowing their male students freedom to stay out at night, a policy that critics say is sexist and outdated. Asked about the practice on the NDTV news channel, Manekha Gandhi said it was necessary to protect young women from their own hormones. \u201cTo protect you from your own hormonal outbursts, perhaps a certain protection, a Lakshman Rekha [red line] is drawn,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can make it [the curfew] six, seven or eight, that depends on college to college but it really is for your own safety,\u201d she told the studio audience of college students during a special show to mark International Women\u2019s Day. Gandhi said a similar deadline should be put in place for male students, but many social media users ridiculed her for her comments. \u201cYou know what would be safest? Lock hormonal men in, instead of denying women the right to lead a full life,\u201d tweeted one critic. Gandhi, who is the sister-in-law of opposition leader Sonia Gandhi, is no stranger to controversy. Last year she angered women\u2019s rights campaigners arguing for a law against marital rape by saying that could not apply in India because society viewed marriage as sacrosanct. In 2015, female students in Delhi launched a campaign against the curfews under the name Pinjra Tod (\u201cBreak the Cage\u201d). University residences generally justify the rules with concern for the safety of young women in a country where sexual violence is widespread. A flicker of controversy from the US, where the lights have gone out on the Statue of Liberty. Was Lady Liberty joining the Day Without Women and showing her support for the global IWD strike? Plenty on social media seemed to think so. Sadly, the reason turned out to be rather more mundane: As our Southeast Asia correspondent Oliver Holmes reports, the forced marriage of women and girls from Myanmar into China has been highlighted today by the Freedom Fund, a private philanthropic initiative dedicated to ending slavery. The organisation\u2019s CEO, Nick Grono, has been travelling around Myanmar during the past few days and sends this report: China\u2019s one-child policy, and the preference of parents for boys, means that by 2025-2030, an estimated 22 to 30 million Chinese men will be unable to find women to marry. This is creating a huge demand for foreign \u2018wives\u2019. We heard devastating stories from women who have returned from China. One told us how she travelled to what she thought was a well-paying job in the north of Myanmar, only to be sold into marriage in China. She was trapped near Beijing for seven years, and had two daughters with her \u2018husband\u2019, only to then be deported by Chinese police to Myanmar. She has not had contact with her daughters since then. Another told us how she was deceived by a friend (who turned out to be a marriage broker) to travel to the border with China. There she was sold to a Chinese man for US$9,300. When she did not become pregnant within seven months, this man sold her to another Chinese man for $11,500. She was trapped in that \u2018marriage\u2019 for three years before her family and Myanmar police managed to secure her release. We heard many other equally heart-wrenching stories. Grono has met with Myanmar officials in the capital, Naypyitaw, and says there is a genuine willingness by the authorities to fight forced marriage. He said the Freedom Fund has a strategy ready and hopes to establish a presence in the country. Zehra Khan has much to celebrate on International Women\u2019s Day. It is exactly four months since members of the Home-Based Women Workers Federation (HBWWF) in Sindh province in Pakistan \u2013 of which Khan is secretary general \u2013 finally received legal recognition. The province\u2019s chief minister, Syed Murad Ali Shah, signed a policy that means the region\u2019s estimated 5 million home-based workers \u2013 the majority of whom are women \u2013 can register as workers and access benefits. \u201cIt was an important day not only for the history of the labour movement in Sindh and Pakistan, but also for south Asia,\u201d says Khan, whose federation has more than 4,500 members. \u201cOnce they are legally accepted as workers, they can be registered with the government-run social security institution, [and] be part of [the] workers\u2019 welfare board to enjoy benefits like health, education and housing, as well as those offered after retirement,\u201d she adds. Almost 80% of an estimated 12 million Pakistani home-based workers are women. As well as unpaid domestic work, the women often spend up to 10 hours a day making garments, footwear, sports goods, and arts and crafts behind closed doors. Their work is often invisible to the rest of the world, despite having propped up the country\u2019s informal economy for so long. \u201cThey are left to negotiate with the middlemen. Many often get deprived of payment or chastised if they demand better wages,\u201d says Khan. The new government policy, however, brings hope that this kind of exploitation will soon come to an end. Once registered as workers, the women will be able to demand a basic level of pay as set out in the Minimum Wages Act of 2015. Raising a few eyebrows in Australia today is this IWD tribute by Liberal senator Eric Abetz, who has taken to Facebook (retweeted here by Labor MP Tony Burke) to praise Queen Elizabeth II. Fair enough, to a point: plenty of people would applaud her role in public life. As an example of where \u201chard work and commitment\u201d can get you in life, the logic goes a little astray. But the most jarring note is surely that dismissal of \u201cdemanding that people \u2026 artificially promote you simply because of your sex\u201d. If Elizabeth had had a brother \u2013 even a younger one \u2013 she would not have been entitled to that throne at all, of course. In Australia, more than 1,000 early childhood educators have walked off the job to campaign for equal pay in the \u201cpink-collar\u201d sector. Dozens of childcare centres closed mid-afternoon on International Women\u2019s Day, said to be the largest action taken by the sector in Australia. The national gender pay gap in Australia is 16.2%, but female-dominated industries attract lower wages than those made up of mostly men. The childcare sector is 97% women but qualified early childhood educators earn some of the lowest wages in the country \u2013 as little as $20.61 an hour, or about half the national average wage. It was estimated more than walked off the job at 3.20pm \u2013 the time that women in Australia effectively start working for free. Helen Gibbons, the assistant national secretary of the early childhood union United Voice, said participating educators had worked closely with parents over a matter of weeks to ensure they would not be inconvenienced by the industrial action. \u201cWe\u2019ve been really excited and pleased to see that a lot of parents are really supportive of this campaign and in fact many parents will be joining the educators when they\u2019re walking off the job this afternoon.\u201d India has launched its first all-women cricket league to promote women\u2019s cricket. The sport, which enjoys enormous popularity in India, has been dominated by men for decades. Founders say the want a women\u2019s league that enjoys the same prestige as the male Indian Premier League, which has drawn cricket stars from around the world and has huge sponsorship from multinational companies and celebrities. In a statement, founder Parul Jain said, \u201cIt\u2019s important that young girls coming through can see cricket as a viable option to play at the highest level. The WCL #T20 League is expected to be of the same repute as the Indian Premier League (IPL) and women Big Bash League of Australia in support of women.\u201d \u201cThis will lead to greater interest in women\u2019s cricket in India, which has generally been given much less importance than the men\u2019s sport. With many sports getting their own professional leagues and ever-growing popularity in the country, it is time that the women cricket league is formed. It is no surprise that the fierce team of eves does not get as much attention and opportunities neither from the sports bodies or the sponsors in India as the men\u2019s team,\u201d he said. Founders say India has hundreds of millions of women cricket fans, but few opportunities to play the sport at a professional level. The league will encourage women competitors, who are often discouraged from playing sports, especially in more conservative parts of the country. Sunita Sharma, the country\u2019s first female cricket coach, who is closely associated with the project said, \u201cIt\u2019s been more than three decades since the Indian women cricket team has been formed and has won various matches globally, still there is hardly any acknowledgement to women as per men cricketers in India.\u201d An Australian women is running 3,000km across 184 countries in support of rape survivors following her own personal attack, Oliver Holmes reports. Claire McFarlane began the campaign, named Footsteps to Inspire, in July last year in what she hopes will \u201cremove the taboo around rape, support the healing process and ultimately make lasting change\u201d. \u201cIn 1999, I was brutally raped and left for dead on the streets of Paris,\u201d McFarlane said in an email to the Guardian. \u201cWhat followed was an arduous, long battle to find justice and it only came to an end in October 2015. Through sharing my own story of survival, I\u2019ve become an advocate for survivors of rape.\u201d McFarlane will run 16km in each country to signify the 16 years it took for her case against a perpetrator to go through the court system. She has started raising donations for her run, which has taken her from South Africa to India to Papua New Guinea. It will take four years to complete, with McFarlane moving country every week. She ran most recently in Singapore and landed in the Philippines on Monday night. Her next run is on Saturday on the west coast of Luzon, in an area called Zambales. McFarlane says she is using beach running as a way to tackle the issue of rape in an empowering way. \u201cI\u2019ve chosen to use a very different medium to talk about rape: that is, adventure and sport. Sport unites us and often brings people together to make a stand for something they believe in,\u201d she said. Funds raised for the cause are donated to local projects or organisations helping rape survivors as well as part of the cost of the trip, in which McFarlane meets with NGOs working to combat sexual violence. McFarlane will also collect data on survivors of sexual violence in all 184 nations, which she will compile for a research report. Some readers have been in touch to let me know what they have been, or will be, doing to mark International Women\u2019s Day. Do feel free to contact me on Twitter @Claire_Phipps, or via the comments below. There was more unwelcome news for Japan ahead of International Women\u2019s Day, reports Justin McCurry from Tokyo, with the release of a report showing that the country ranks 163rd out of 193 countries in female representation in lower houses of parliament. The defence minister, Tomomi Inada; the leader of the biggest opposition party, Renho Murata; and the governor of Tokyo, Yuriko Koike, are all women, but Japan trails behind all of its G7 counterparts in overall political representation, according to the Inter-Parliamentary Union. The report, released on Wednesday, did note, however, that a record 28 women were elected to Japan\u2019s upper house last July. Koike, who has criticised the golf venue for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics over its sexist membership policy, is aiming to put a dent in male domination of politics, at least at the local level, by securing a female majority in city assembly elections this July. \u201cSince I am the governor of this mega-city and hopefully the assembly will have a female majority, that will be a big change,\u201d Koike said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. \u201cSelecting as many women politicians as possible in the local assembly will surely make Tokyo change.\u201d In Australia\u2019s capital, the National Press Club hosted Kenyan educator and social activist Kakenya Ntaiya to mark International Women\u2019s Day. Ntaiya is the founder of the Kakenya Centre for Excellence, a boarding school for girls in Enoosaen. The centre requires as a condition of enrolment that girls are not subjected to genital mutilation or forced marriage. Ntaiya told the story of bargaining for her education at the age of seven, when she told her father she would submit to female genital mutilation if he would allow her to complete her education: I went through the cuts and it was a very horrifying experience. There is no anaesthesia when it\u2019s done, there is no medication, I bled, I fainted after that. I\u2019m very lucky that I\u2019m standing here today sharing my story. Many girls die. I was determined. I went back to school. She finished her education, won a scholarship to an American university (which involved another round of bargaining with the powerful men of her small Kenyan village), completed a PhD, and in the course of her studies, decided she would open a school in her village for 10 girls I arrived there and 100 girls showed up. It was not just the girls, it was their parents, it was their grandmothers, it was the people who really thirsted for an education. So my ten became 30. I have dreamed big. My girls are graduating this year. This year, 26 of them are finishing high school. They are going to university: this is the first time in my village that we are going to be sending 26 girls \u2013 not one woman, but 26 of them. That is the future of Kenya. Think about those girls. Some of them you might meet some day. Think about them as heads of banks. Think of them \u2013 that\u2019s their dream. They want to be doctors. Think about them as lawyers. Think about them making change in the whole world. That\u2019s why we stand here today to celebrate the progress we have made, by pushing ourselves to be bold, to move forward, to say it\u2019s time that women need to be there. Please don\u2019t wait to be handed over. We have to step forward. We have to be bold. On Monday night, on Australia\u2019s Q&amp;A debate show, Mei Fong, a journalist and author of a book on China\u2019s one-child policy, now based in Washington DC, said the ability to protest was \u201ca great privilege\u201d. Fong praised the regular protests in America\u2019s capital, \u201cthe heart of crazy Trumpland\u201d, adding: It is protests against the immigration ban, against mistreatment of women, and I bless my heart \u2013 it\u2019s so wonderful when I see people chant, holding up signs in the streets. You guys don\u2019t realise how wonderful it is to be able to get out there and not be tear-gassed. Two years ago, Li Maizi was imprisoned after she and four other young feminists attempted to mark International Women\u2019s Day in China. This year Li is spending International Women\u2019s Day in the UK where she spoke at Soas in London last night and will address the University of Nottingham tonight. She has also written for the Guardian about her treatment \u2013 and the treatment of women \u2013 in her home country: I often think of the day I was detained in Beijing. On the night of 6 March 2015, the police knocked on my door and took me to the station, where I was questioned nonstop for 24 hours. Later I was sent to a detention centre, where I was held for 37 days \u2026 Two years later, is there any hope for the Chinese feminist movement? Definitely, yes. Since my arrest, there has been both progress and a backlash against women\u2019s rights \u2026 Women are becoming more active in the fight against gender discrimination. When I was released from detention, I faced a tough decision: should I continue my activism, or give up? I chose to continue. What I do is for the rights of women all over the world. But I can\u2019t help but be especially concerned about China. My own experiences, and the experiences of my friends in China, have had a profound effect on me \u2026 Because of China\u2019s two-child policy, abortions are readily available. If you get pregnant with a third child, abortion is compulsory. But I don\u2019t see our free access to abortion as a sign of progress, as reproductive rights only apply to married women. If you are unmarried, it is illegal to give birth and you will face heavy fines. Some NGOs are calling on the government to grant single women their reproductive rights. Maxine Beneba Clarke, Emily Maguire and two recently deceased authors, Georgia Blain and Cory Taylor, are among six authors shortlisted for the 2016 Stella prize, celebrating female writers in Australia. The shortlisted books, announced on International Women\u2019s Day, are Between a Wolf and a Dog by Georgia Blain; The Hate Race by Maxine Beneba Clarke; Poum and Alexandre by Catherine de Saint Phalle; An Isolated Incident by Emily Maguire; The Museum of Modern Love by Heather Rose; and Dying: A Memoir by Cory Taylor. \u201cThe 2017 Stella prize shortlist celebrates books that combine extraordinary literary accomplishment with the social and familial reverberations of some of the most significant issues of our time: racism, violence against women, the aftermath of totalitarianism, the place of art in everyday life and the way we confront our individual mortality,\u201d said Brenda Walker, the chair of the judging panel. Staff at Australia\u2019s Fairfax media are holding a \u201cFairfax Sausage Fest\u201d to highlight the 23.2% pay gap in newspaper publishing. Journalists are donning their vintage finery \u2013 \u201cretro-grade dress up day\u201d \u2013 to tell management to stop living in the past and make women equal to men in terms of pay. Justin McCurry reports: The Korean Women\u2019s Association United is holding its annual Korean Women\u2019s Conference in Seoul today. The association says it is working \u201cfor the realisation of a democracy where everyone can enjoy equal basic citizenship rights regardless of gender, sexual orientation, origin or class\u201d. Despite the rapid economic growth South Korea has enjoyed since the end of the Korean war in 1953, the country\u2019s women still earn far less than their male counterparts. According to the Women In Work Index 2017 released by PricewaterhouseCoopers last month, the gender pay gap in South Korea was 36%, more than twice the average of 16 percent among OECD countries. That means South Korean women are, on average, paid 36% less than their male counterparts. The report said that if current pay trends persist, South Korean women will have to wait more than a century before their wages catch up with those of men, according to the Yonhap news agency. South Korea elected its first female president in late 2012 \u2013 the now-impeached Park Geun-hye - but gender disparity reigns in the country\u2019s national assembly, where just 17% of the the 300 members are women, according to a recent study. That is still the highest proportion of seats held by women in the assembly\u2019s history. Over 30 women\u2019s organisations in India will march in New Delhi today for the One Billion Rising march. The campaign started five years ago, on Valentine\u2019s day, and spread across 207 countries, as women marched together to end rape and sexual violence against women. In Delhi the march had a particular significance, as the city was still reeling after the horrific gang rape and murder of medical student Jyoti Singh. In 2012, after the details of Singh\u2019s case emerged, India burst into protest, with candlelight vigils, and protests across the country. The case paved the way for small victories, including a special court to fast-track rape cases in the country, and a greater awareness of the country\u2019s ingrained culture of violence against women. This year, One Billion Rising\u2019s campaigns are focusing on ending the exploitation of women. More than 1,000 women are expected to gather at the Rajiv Chowk metro station around 11am local time. After the demonstration, a forum to discuss the work of various women\u2019s organisations will be held. In Australia, Dr Mehreen Faruqi, an MP with Greens NSW and a high-profile campaigner for access to abortion, began International Women\u2019s Day with a breakfast for a few hundred women at NSW Parliament House. She became the first Muslim woman to join an Australian parliament in 2013, benefiting from the Greens\u2019 affirmative action policy in a seat that had been preselected for women. She said it concerned her that the Australian parliament\u2019s upper house had the lowest percentage of women of any in Australia: That really boggles my mind, I have to say. And being a woman of colour, there\u2019s hardly any diversity. That\u2019s kind of a challenge as you do feel a little bit lonely, in that space. She understood why a career in politics would not appeal to women, given both the isolation and the \u201cadversarial environment\u201d: You wouldn\u2019t believe how many women have said, \u2018good on you Mehreen, but I can\u2019t do it\u2019. Other parties needed to take \u201cserious action\u201d to make sure woman were selected for winnable spots, said Faruqi. Faruqi recently came under fire for her comments that there was \u201csystemic racism\u201d in Australia; a Liberal upper house MP said it was evidence that the Greens \u201csecretly loathe this wonderful country\u201d. She said, especially in the context of Australia\u2019s history, it was \u201cundeniable\u201d that there had been racism, though she loved it as she did Pakistan, her birth country. When she arrived in Australia she was made to feel quite welcome, she said, but that had changed in the last 10 to 15 years: The amount of racism and sexism women are facing, especially women of colour and Muslim women and those that wear a hijab that are easy to identify \u2013 I don\u2019t want us to go that way. I want us to be the best country possible, and that is respectful, multicultural and inclusive. But the first step towards that is to actually acknowledge that racism exists. Tokyo will host a women\u2019s march from 3pm local time today, Justin McCurry reports from Japan. \u201cWe have been inspired by the women\u2019s marches which took place around the world [in January], and with the wish to walk together on International Women\u2019s Day, decided to plan the following event and march,\u201d the organisers said on the event\u2019s Facebook page. Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has had limited success in his \u201cwomenomics\u201d campaign to raise the profile of women in the workforce, a measure he says will boost economic growth and address the country\u2019s greying working-age population. While the proportion of working-age Japanese women with jobs has increased \u2013 at 66.7%, the rate is on a par with the US \u2013 many do poorly paid part-time or temporary jobs that critics say are contributing to a rise in poverty levels in the world\u2019s third-biggest economy. Although women are notoriously under-represented in Japanese boardrooms, the country\u2019s powerful \u2013 and male-dominated \u2013 business lobby, Keidanren, has just sent an all-female business lobby to the US, led by BT Japan president Haruno Yoshida. In Indonesia, a coalition of women\u2019s right groups will be staging a march from central Jakarta to the presidential palace to mark International Women\u2019s Day. Once in front of the palace, a diverse range of speakers will address the crowd, including female migrant workers \u2013 a group often subject to exploitation and abuse in the Middle East and across the region \u2013 as well as fisherwomen, female farmers and labourers, and victims of the recent and controversial riverside evictions in the capital. There will also be theatre and music performances, as well as a dance performance by transgender students. Organisers from the IWD action committee expect a turnout of around 2,000 people. The event follows a successful turnout for a planned Women\u2019s march just a few days ago, where hundreds dressed in pink and purple and took to the streets to demand equal rights for women. Several Indonesian women dressed in blood-stained kebayas, traditional Javanese blouses, led the march holding signs that showed how many women are victims of sexual abuse and are killed in fatal assaults each year. Initially inspired by the feminist movement that swept America after the election of Donald Trump, the Jakarta march on Saturday gave voice to the state of women\u2019s rights in Indonesia \u2013 a country where over recent years aspiring female police officers have been subject to virginity tests, and where FGM remains widespread. Papua New Guinea has for some time been considered one of the most dangerous places in the world to be a woman or child. Rates of family and sexual violence are at epidemic levels, but many organisations \u2013 at community, government, and international levels \u2013 have worked hard to address it. Ume Wainetti is the long-term coordinator of the PNG family and sexual violence action committee, and she says there have been great changes \u2013 hindered by a lack of follow-through and real support from the government. She tells the Guardian: At the end of last year we passed the [government] strategy on family and sexual violence, but we don\u2019t know if funding will be made available to implement it. We are screaming and shouting for things to be done but what support is being given for it is another matter. There is government support but no financial commitment. The fear of stigma and retribution continues to stop many women in violent relationships from seeking protection or assistance, Wainetti says, and there is a lack of services beyond the provincial level. About 85% of Papua New Guineans live in rural areas. However, Wainetti says there have been changes in community awareness, not just about the unacceptable levels of violence but also the place of women in the upper levels of leadership. The country goes to a national election in June. \u201cI\u2019m here at a meeting where 50 women are attending training, learning \u2013 if they win \u2013 how they will do in parliament and what is expected of them,\u201d says Wainetti. \u201cI have not really seen many women confirmed candidates.\u201d At the last election, there were three and she hopes 2017 will see more. \u201cWhether they have funding or party support to make it to parliament is another matter. There are changes but we still need to see some concrete support.\u201d Some of that support comes from international NGOs like MSF, ChildFund, and the Red Cross, as well as foreign governments. This morning Australia\u2019s foreign minister, Julie Bishop, who is currently in PNG, announced AU$10m in grants to six international NGOs to deliver projects promoting the rights of women and girls in 12 developing countries, including PNG. Bishop said the Gender Action Platform projects \u201cwork to increase women\u2019s economic opportunities, improve women\u2019s participation in leadership, and reduce gender-based violence\u201d. Writing in Guardian Australia today, Greens NSW MP Mehreen Faruqi says the right for women to control their bodies is still under attack in Australia \u2013 not least by the continuing restrictions on access to abortion: So many people are shocked to discover that abortion is still a criminal offence in both Queensland and New South Wales. While medical practice has advanced and majority public opinion has shifted in support of a woman\u2019s right to choose, more than century-old laws remain unaltered in these two states \u2026 Many doctors do not perform this procedure owing to this risk of prosecution. Services are limited, privatised and expensive, creating barriers to access, especially for rural and regional women. It\u2019s not unusual to see intimidation of patients by anti-choice protesters picketing outside clinics with graphic images and even handing out plastic foetuses in an effort to shame them. This is what criminalisation has led to: shame and stigma. We must remove the shame and end the stigma. Today\u2019s Google doodle for IWD highlights the lives of 13 women, as told by a woman to her granddaughter as a bedtime story. All of the women featured, Google says, have previously featured in doodles of their own, but usually only within their home countries. The doodle shows the stories of American suffragist Ida Wells; Egyptian pilot Lotfia El Nadi; Mexican artist Frida Kahlo; Italian-born Brazilian architect Lina Bo Bardi; Soviet scientist Olga Skorokhodova; South African activist Miriam Makeba; American astronaut Sally Ride; the first Muslim woman to compete in the Olympics, Turkey\u2019s Halet \u00c7ambel; English computer pioneer Ada Lovelace; Indian dancer Rukmini Devi; Argentinian doctor Cecilia Grierson; Korea\u2019s first female lawyer and judge Lee Tai-young; and French tennis player Suzanne Lenglen. ABC News presenter Juanita Phillips has some advice for those perturbed by the Australian broadcaster\u2019s all-female line-up today: China \u2013 home to around 675 million women \u2013 is unlikely to witness much IWD action today. Two years ago, five feminists who were planning to put some stickers on buses to mark International Women\u2019s Day were locked up by authorities on suspicion of \u201cpicking quarrels and creating a disturbance\u201d. The women \u2013 Wei Tingting, Li Tingting (known as Li Maizi), Wu Rongrong, Wang Man and Zheng Churan (Datu) \u2013 were intending to distribute stickers with slogans such as \u201cPolice: go arrest those who committed sexual harassment\u201d. Just a fortnight ago, an account called \u201cFeminist Voice in China\u201d on social networking site Sina Weibo was banned for 30 days after it posted a Chinese translation of an article in which academics argued for a new \u201cmilitant feminist struggle\u201d against Donald Trump\u2019s policies, calling for an international women\u2019s strike today, 8 March. The article was first published in the Guardian: you can read it here. Xiong Jing, an editor for the Feminist Voice, said Weibo had not told the group the reason for the ban, but: We are guessing that it\u2019s because we sent out some tweets calling for a women\u2019s strike action against Trump. All day today across TV, radio and digital, Australia\u2019s ABC is celebrating International Women\u2019s Day with an all-female line-up. Women will take over from their male counterparts on programs they host from NewsRadio to ABC TV. News bulletins across the country and television programs will focus on telling women\u2019s stories. In a special IWD broadcast at 1pm, Radio National will revisit its groundbreaking women\u2019s show Coming Out with a special Coming Out, Again, which will reunite some of the Coming Out cast from the 70s to the 90s, such as Julie Rigg, Nicola Joseph, Fiona Martin and Kath Duncan. Mark Colvin\u2019s PM will instead be hosted by Kim Landers and Julia Zemiro\u2019s Home Delivery features social commentator Susan Carland. On ABC iview you can watch a collection of programs highlighting the work of women including artist Margaret Olley, journalist Ita Buttrose and comedian Judith Lucy. But Rupert Murdoch\u2019s stable was cranky with the ABC for devoting the day to celebrating women. A front page in the Daily Telegraph yesterday called it tokenism and a \u201cman ban\u201d. \u201cThe ABC will boot all of its male television and radio hosts off air tomorrow in a bizarre and patronising bid to promote \u2018gender equality\u2019,\u201d the Tele reported. The Australian soon jumped on the bandwagon, with not one but two pieces ridiculing the move: \u201cThe ABC in its wisdom is dumping its male presenters tomorrow in favour of an all female line-up.\u201d The ABC was forced to defend the initiative. International Women\u2019s Day is an opportunity for the ABC to draw attention to one of the great issues of the modern age. Gender parity is one of the biggest challenges facing the Australian, and the global, economy today. The #IWDABC line-up on International Women\u2019s Day represents one day of activity; however it sits within a broader ABC campaign focusing on equality and the recognition of women, and supporting the UN\u2019s #BeBoldForChange initiative. There are a bunch of happenings going on around Southeast Asia for International Women\u2019s Day, reports our correspondent Oliver Holmes. In Singapore, the iconic Vagina Monologues is on. The show started in New York two decades ago and has since been translated into nearly 50 languages to \u201cempower women and men, stimulate dialogue and support social causes such as ending violence against women\u201d. Tickets are sold out but you can jump on a waiting list here. A portion of the profit will go towards care packages covering food, medicine, sanitary napkins, infant formula and children uniforms for destitute women on the streets of Johor Bahr, in Malaysia. Also in the city state (and not sold out!) there is Queer Karaoke. It\u2019s billed as for feminists and pacifists \u201cpassionate about women\u2019s issues\u201d. Book here. In Myanmar, head to the lush People\u2019s Park at 4.30pm local for a celebration of art exhibitions, music, theatre and public readings. The organisers say there will be some \u201csurprises\u201d too. In Thailand, there is the \u201cHeForShe\u201d arts week Bangkok, run by UN Women and starting today. At the Bangkok Arts and Cultural Centre, there will be exhibits and performances, including from Thai-Australian video artist Kawita Vatanajyankur and Hong Kong-based graphic designer Cath Love. Also in Bangkok, a four-days film festival starts in SF Cinema Central World to showcase seven award-winning movies based on gender issues, including \u2018He Named Me Malala\u2019 and \u2018Dev Bhoomi\u2019. International Women\u2019s Day talks are being held across the Philippines, too: here and here and here. A key feature of 2017\u2019s International Women\u2019s Day is the call for \u201ca day without women\u201d \u2013 for women to take the day off work (paid and unpaid, at home and out of the home); to avoid shopping for the day, \u201cwith exceptions for small, women- and minority-owned businesses\u201d; to wear red in solidarity. In America, the call to strike has been led by the organisers of the Women\u2019s March, which took place across the US (and the world) the day after Trump\u2019s inauguration. A group of feminist activists and academics wrote recently in the Guardian about the need to strike: The idea is to mobilize women, including trans women, and all who support them in an international day of struggle \u2013 a day of striking, marching, blocking roads, bridges, and squares, abstaining from domestic, care and sex work, boycotting, calling out misogynistic politicians and companies, striking in educational institutions. These actions are aimed at making visible the needs and aspirations of those whom lean-in feminism ignored: women in the formal labor market, women working in the sphere of social reproduction and care, and unemployed and precarious working women. In embracing a feminism for the 99%, we take inspiration from the Argentinian coalition Ni Una Menos. Violence against women, as they define it, has many facets: it is domestic violence, but also the violence of the market, of debt, of capitalist property relations, and of the state; the violence of discriminatory policies against lesbian, trans and queer women; the violence of state criminalization of migratory movements; the violence of mass incarceration; and the institutional violence against women\u2019s bodies through abortion bans and lack of access to free healthcare and free abortion. But Guardian columnist Lindy West, speaking on Australian TV this week, while agreeing that \u201cprotest is most effective when it disrupts people\u2019s lives\u201d, echoed concerns of others who are cautious about the proposed strike: It would be tremendously effective if we could mobilise every single woman in the world \u2026 A concern for me, as a very privileged, financially stable white woman who works from home \u2026 it\u2019s very easy for me to say yes, everyone should go on strike but I want to be very cognisant of the fact there are very many women who cannot afford to lose one day\u2019s worth of pay, let alone risk their job. You can find details of strikes and other protests taking place around the world from Australia to Uruguay via the links on this page. Today, Margaret Carey \u2013 director of an early childhood centre in Sydney, Australia \u2013 is striking for the first time ever. She explains why: Women are an essential part of society. We hold together the household. We hold together the family. We care for our partners (though in a genuine relationship it is certainly not a one-way street). We care for our children. We care for others\u2019 children. We care for our parents as they grow older. And we fill the jobs equated with caring. In my sector, 97% of us are women. It is not because the work we do has no value. It is because the work we do has an intrinsic female association. \u2018Care\u2019 in any role should not be seen as of little value. If anything, it should be seen as value-adding to the role. Look at aged care workers, educators, nurses, teachers, social workers, psychologists, therapists, tutors, doctors. None of these professions are seen only as caring, but care is understood as intrinsic to their role. But it is we in early childhood who forever need to point out that we are the same: we do caring but our whole job is far more than that. I am walking off because I want the government and society to recognise that an early childhood educator is a professional role and one that must be given its deserved status. The first real step, a big step, in this direction is to receive professional wages, not 20 patronising dollars an hour. More of the globe is now ticking over into International Women\u2019s Day. Here\u2019s Lebanon\u2019s government palace in Beirut, illuminated purple for the day: In Mumbai, the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus railway station has turned pink: When\u2019s International Men\u2019s Day? It\u2019s 19 November, since you ask. If you\u2019d like to hear more about how International Men\u2019s Day is on 19 November, can I suggest you follow comedian Richard Herring on Twitter, as he endures his annual feat of replying to all the people wondering when International Men\u2019s Day is. Here\u2019s what Herring wrote for the Guardian on International Men\u2019s Day in 2015: International Women\u2019s Day is on 8 March: 24 hours (of the 8,760 annually available) set aside to celebrate women and all of their achievements. And people get furious about it. Surely, you might think, you could only be cross about it because that definitely isn\u2019t enough time to celebrate the achievements of over than 50% of the population. But no \u2026 So for the last two International Women\u2019s Days I have tried to highlight this stupidity. I have got up early, logged on to Twitter and searched for the phrase \u201cinternational men\u2019s day\u201d, found every single person who has tweeted the question and responded to them all individually: \u201cIt\u2019s 19 November.\u201d There are thousands to get through. It goes on relentlessly, for hours and hours, but I try to get to them all because to see the same moronic question asked over and over again by people (who don\u2019t even think just to check Google to make sure they\u2019re not making an arse of themselves) is very funny, and shows exactly why an international women\u2019s day is necessary. Incidentally, nobody tweets me back to say: \u201cOh thanks for the information. I was wondering when it was.\u201d Almost like they don\u2019t want to know the answer to their own question. My hope is that if I can spend a day a year dealing with this issue, then that means that everyone else can get on with making International Women\u2019s Day about celebrating women and not complaining about the supposed raw deal men get. So I let men know that they do have a day if they want to celebrate themselves. Though not many of them do when it comes along, weirdly. Incorrect assumptions are still being made that gender equality has been achieved, despite disturbing and comprehensive evidence to the contrary, an investigation by Australia\u2019s sex discrimination commissioner, Kate Jenkins, has found. Her findings include the experiences of more than 1,000 women she interviewed while travelling to every state and territory over a six-month period last year to learn about Australia\u2019s progress towards gender equality. Women working in rural and remote areas were particularly vulnerable to inequality, Jenkins found. One young woman told her how she was asked to wear a bikini while fruit picking to get paid a bonus. Jenkins heard stories of women not being taken seriously or experiencing sexual harassment in these areas in particular. \u201cA lot of the rural women were really facing greater barriers to women in metro areas,\u201d she said. It\u2019s too easy to lump all women together as a homogenous group of white, Anglo-Saxon, heterosexual, able-bodied people, many who feel they are breaking down some of those barriers to equality. But there are many different voices in this, and my voice is tied to having spoken to rural women, LGBTI women, older women, women with disabilities, migrant women and Aboriginal women. Research shows that women with disabilities are 40% more likely than women without disabilities to be the victims of domestic violence; and that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women are 32 times more likely to be admitted to hospital as a result of family violence-related assault than non-Indigenous women in Australia. The findings were launched today to coincide with international women\u2019s day. Jenkins said it was distressing to see the same arguments emerge each year that having a day for women was biased against men and unnecessary. Women from more than 40 countries are staging a strike from all work, paid and unpaid, to highlight women\u2019s power within global economies. But what if you can\u2019t join them? Here are other ways you can show solidarity, from wearing red to avoiding the shops for the day. New Zealand was the first country to give women the vote but gender equality is far from achieved. The pay gap is of particular concern, having remained steady at about 12% for the past decade. On current figures, it will be 45 years before New Zealand women are paid equally. That\u2019s even though the Equal Pay Act was passed in 1972 \u2013 it has never been enforced. Last month the New Zealand Council of Trade Unions launched the Treat Her Right campaign to lobby the government to take action on the issue of pay inequality. On Tuesday, the Ministry for Women released the findings of the first comprehensive study of the causes of the gender pay gap in New Zealand. It found that \u201chard to measure factors\u201d such as conscious and unconscious bias, and \u201cdifferences in choices and behaviours between men and women\u201d, accounted for 80% of the difference. For women on higher wages, the pay gap was significant and hard to explain; for women on lower incomes, factors such as type of work, family responsibilities, education and age remained important. In her first major speech since taking on the portfolio of minister for women, Paula Bennett said the difference in pay was \u201creally disappointing\u201d, and called on her audience \u2013 members of the Human Resource Institute of New Zealand \u2013 to take steps towards addressing it. She urged employers to remember three things: It\u2019s not about what you can get away with. It\u2019s not about what she is willing to accept. It\u2019s simply about you paying her what she is worth. Julia Gillard, former prime minister of Australia and current chair of the board of the Global Partnership for Education, writes today for Guardian Australia about the hidden women of International Women\u2019s Day: Considering that approximately 130 million girls worldwide are not attending primary through upper-secondary school and that women represent nearly two thirds of the world\u2019s illiterate, we must ask: How many other innovations and inventions \u2013 great and small \u2013 have been lost to the world because so many minds are idle on the sidelines of human progress? Today is set to be one of the most political International Women\u2019s Days in history, Alexandra Topping and Molly Redden report: From Thailand to Poland, the United States to Australia, the first Global Women\u2019s Strike will see action on both the industrial and domestic fronts, with participants keen to show solidarity with an energised global women\u2019s movement. \u201cWe are united, we are international \u2013 and we are everywhere,\u201d said Klementyna Suchanow, a Poland-based organiser of the Global Women\u2019s Strike, adding that the walkout would put governments and institutions under pressure by giving women a voice that has long been ignored. \u201cWe are an army of women across the globe and we are no longer asking to be listened to. The world is being forced to listen to us.\u201d The theme for 2017\u2019s International Women\u2019s Day \u2013 which celebrates the social, economic, cultural and political achievements of women \u2013 is #BeBoldForChange. Organisers of the Global Women\u2019s Strike have joined forces with coordinators of the Women\u2019s March and hundreds of human rights and women\u2019s campaigners to capitalise on momentum in the movement in the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s election. Up to 2 million people around the world marched for equality in January the day after his inauguration. The Women\u2019s March \u2013 which now has organisers across 200 cities in 80 countries \u2013 has called on supporters not to engage in paid or unpaid labour and only spend money in small and female-owned businesses. Recognising that the poor financial situation and rigid work laws mean many will not be able to take part in a physical strike, organisers are urging supporters to wear red, a colour historically associated with the labour movement, in solidarity. In other countries women will wear black, or different colours, while the focus on issues from femicide to abortion will be decided in each nation. Hello from Sydney, where International Women\u2019s Day is up and running (and for readers still in Tuesday time zones: think of this as a bonus preview). We\u2019ll be covering the full day live from our offices in Sydney, London and New York; and with correspondents chipping in from all over the world. We\u2019ll be watching out for events, protests and stories of \u201c a day without women\u201d, as well as highlighting some of the key (and less key but just really, persistently irritating) issues that continue to thwart and hinder progress towards equality worldwide. We\u2019d also like to hear what\u2019s happening where you are \u2013 let me know in the comments below or find me on Twitter @Claire_Phipps.",

Rather, it is arguably closer to a (hypothetical) scene from Pirandello\u2019s play Enrico IV, in which the protagonist, a modern Italian aristocrat, falls from his horse and awakes believing he is an 11th-century Holy Roman Emperor; his entourage conspires to keep him in this delusion.

One is the mighty Social Democratic party (SPD) left and the other is the radical left.</p> <p>Second, throughout history, the radical left\u2019s hopes have been smashed by the SPD over and over again. In 1914, the radical left hoped the SPD would not support the looming war, but this hope was shattered. The SPD signed up to war. After the first world war, in 1918-19, the radical left hoped for basic democracy, and an end to militarism and capitalism. This hope was again destroyed as the SPD betrayed the revolution. Many workers were killed by Gustav Noske and Friedrich Ebert\u2019s SPD.</p> <p>At the end of the Weimar Republic, in 1933, the radical left hoped for a call to arms to fight Nazism. Again, this hope was smashed. A few days after Hitler\u2019s takeover, the German left vanished into Nazi torture centres and early concentration camps.</p> <p>Fast forward to recent times and you will find the continuation of a history of shattered hopes and dreams. Only a few years ago, the radical left and the SPD had a solid majority in my home state of Hessen. But the SPD destroyed the hopes for a left state government by enabling an arch-conservative to become state premier.</p> <p>Finally, during the last federal election, in 2013, the SPD won 193 seats and the radical left 127, together reaching 320 and thereby easily beating Angela Merkel\u2019s conservatives, who won 311 seats. But the hopes for a government of the left were once again crushed mercilessly by the SPD. Instead of a progressive government, the party supported Merkel.</p> <p>What can we learn from this history of shattered dreams?

If people are deifying a man who looks like a fairytale prince, it\u2019s because they\u2019re hoping to be saved in time for a happy ending. And this task has fallen to ... Canada.
