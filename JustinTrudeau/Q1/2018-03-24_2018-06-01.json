There is an eerie sense of calm after all the ructions caused by the Italian political crisis, with investors hoping a new government can be formed after all without the need for another election campaign. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Not too long ago, a coalition government in Italy consisting of two eurosceptic populist parties was a feared and unlikely prospect that many believed would majorly concern investors. While much of this remains true, it is also currently viewed as the least unattractive and feasible outcome for markets, with the other alternative being fresh elections and the possibility that the parties are given an even stronger and potentially less euro-friendly mandate. </p> <p>Italy\u2019s President, Sergio Mattarella, may have believed he was acting in the best interest of the country when he rejected to populists choice of Finance Minister but the reality is that in doing so, he has given both parties more ammunition with which to attack the euro. Mattarella has already been accused of acting on behalf of Germany and others while Brussels has been accused of interference, it all feeds very well into the eurosceptics message that the country no longer even has control over its domestic politics.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9b35d86c9efd92c20581531724ce127c1ec69232\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b35d86c9efd92c20581531724ce127c1ec69232/0_22_5309_3184/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Quirinale presidential palace in Rome.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Quirinale presidential palace in Rome.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vincenzo Pinto/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>Should the country move straight on to another election, both Five Star Movement and Lega will look to take advantage of any fury linked to perceived meddling and could significantly add to their numbers. All of a sudden, the worst case scenario prior to the election looks tolerable compared to what could come from another. With both parties now in discussions again, there is a hope that the political impasse can be resolved which is helping to lift sentiment in the near-term. That said, a positive outcome now poses many further risks in the long-term. </p> <p>While Italian assets have bore the brunt of the pain from the latest period of political instability and uncertainty, there has been a negative impact on the wider markets including the euro which dropped to a 10-month low against the dollar. While we\u2019re still far away from the days of the debt crisis and the risk of a breakup, a second election was being portrayed as a vote on the euro which seems drastic and probably overhyped but it certainly hit the single currency. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b0fd09ce4b0033069061649\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/stephanie-kirchgaessner\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-05-31T10:39:41.033Z\">11.39am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Markets are still managing to hold onto their gains - just - on hopes that the Italian political crisis can be resolved before too long.

And, as selling price expectations have been weakening in the recent soft patch of economic data, it does not seem like we are at the start of a marked increase in inflation.</p> <p>The understatement of recent months was also helped by a weakening euro, which dampened some of the effects from the higher oil price. Petrol prices jumped significantly in May, on the back of an oil price of around $80 per barrel for most of the month and a weakening euro.</p> <p>Be careful what you wish for, ECB. After years of pushing for inflation to return to just under 2%, it could not have come at a more difficult time. Eurozone financial market turmoil has returned because of Italian politics this week and it is very difficult to see how the Italian political situation is going to play out. Economic data has been weakening over the past months, and the ECB is eager to determine whether this is just a soft patch. Finally, the US seems on the brink of announcing tariffs on European steel and aluminium, which clouds the exports outlook and could have an additional inflationary impact if the trade conflict gets out of hand.</p> <p>The ECB therefore now has to decide whether it will provide certainty straight away by announcing an extension to QE or take a \u201cwait and see\u201d approach at the June meeting. Then it could just hint at an extension while taking another six weeks to see how the political situation in Italy and the trade conflict with the US play out, and take in more economic data.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-05-31T10:41:13.432Z\">at 11.41am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5b0fba4ae4b022a3efa0dbd4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-05-31T09:22:43.101Z\">10.22am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Eurozone inflation higher than forecast in May</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Eurozone inflation rose by more than expected in May, partly due to the recent surge in oil prices.</p> <p>The increase towards the European Central Bank\u2019s target comes as it wants to run down its stimulus programme, but faces the prospect of market turbulence disturbing its plans.</p> <p>The cost of living in the 19 eurozone countries rose from 1.2% in April to 1.9% in May, according to an initial estimate from Eurostat, higher than the forecasts of around 1.6%.</p> <p>Energy prices rose by 6.1% compared to 2.6% in April, while food was 2.6% higher, uup from 2.4%.</p> <p>Excluding energy and food prices, inflation rose from 1.1% to 1.3%.</p> <p>Meanwhile unemployment in the eurozone fell from 8.6% in March to 8.5% in April.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"82b98669c1329634d7a1a36658ac347054cd128f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/82b98669c1329634d7a1a36658ac347054cd128f/0_0_995_377/500.jpg\" alt=\"euinflate1\" width=\"500\" height=\"189\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b9ba4c6e0ea587e4cdb33cf674d26a941612570c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b9ba4c6e0ea587e4cdb33cf674d26a941612570c/0_0_1018_417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"euinflat2\" width=\"1000\" height=\"410\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-05-31T09:24:44.029Z\">at 10.24am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5b0fb999e4b069235b5cf035\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-05-31T09:02:20.756Z\">10.02am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A UK interest rate rise in August is by no means a done deal, says ING Bank economist James Smith. Commenting on the credit figures, he says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s not something markets or analysts typically spend much time looking at each month, but the unexpectedly sharp fall in consumer credit in March was probably a key factor in the Bank of England\u2019s decision to keep rates on hold in May.</p> <p>Admittedly the reasons for this sudden decline were fairly unclear, and the latest figures released today show that the amount of unsecured consumer credit supplied fully recovered in April, rising by \u00a31.8 billion. This tentatively suggests that the fall was simply a blip, perhaps related to the wider economic slowdown in March (although it\u2019s not entirely clear why the bad weather would have resulted in such a sharp change).</p> <p>We still think this is a story worth keeping an eye on over the next couple of months. A net 39% of banks said they tightened up on credit availability in the first quarter according to a Bank of England survey. If credit growth were to slow further, it would no doubt be a bad omen for growth - particularly as, of what little spending there has been over the past year, much of it appears to have been financed by borrowing.</p> <p>Meanwhile consumers continue to remain cautious. While household incomes are no longer being squeezed quite as much as before, shoppers are now being confronted with higher petrol prices, and the latest confidence surveys suggest individuals remain pessimistic about the economic situation overall.</p> <p>These cracks forming in the retail sector remain a big risk to the Bank of England outlook. While we are inclined to think policymakers have a preference to hike rates again in August if economic data allows (particularly given the better wage growth trend), this is certainly not a done deal.</p> <p>As one committee member said recently, the cost of waiting a bit longer before hiking rates is relatively low.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b0fb766e4b069235b5cf020\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-05-31T08:59:30.553Z\">9.59am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/notayesmansecon/status/1002106329656328198\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Is Sir Dave Ramsden of the Bank of England around to explain how an extra \u00a31.8 billion of unsecured lending in April is &quot;weak credit growth&quot; please?</p>&mdash; Shaun Richards (@notayesmansecon) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/notayesmansecon/status/1002106329656328198?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 31, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The independent economist is referring to remarks made earlier this month at at select committee hearing, when Sir Dave said <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a8b0348e-5da1-11e8-ad91-e01af256df68\">there was a risk households were spending less than the Bank had expected - as reported by the Financial Times (\u00a3).</a></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b0fb2d2e4b00330690614d3\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-05-31T08:44:58.118Z\">9.44am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">UK consumer credit surges in April</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Speaking of credit, there has been a spike in borrowing by UK consumers in April after a slowdown the previous month blamed on the snowy weather.</p> <p>Consumer credit lending rose by a higher than expected \u00a31.832bn, the biggest increase since November 2016, compared to an increase of just \u00a3425m in March.

We see two main drivers: a rebound in core inflation and a jump in energy prices. Core inflation probably reversed its April drop and rose to 1.1% year on year from 0.7%. This would reflect normalization in the price of holiday-sensitive items, with the April reading having been distorted to the downside by the early timing of Easter.

The 5 Star and Lega parties are making renewed efforts to form a coalition, which has eased fears that a new vote could give a mandate for the country to leave the euro - Italexit or Quitaly, take your pick.</p> <p>So Italian bond yields have fallen back from their highs earlier in the week, while European markets are expected to make a positive start. CMC Markets UK\u2019s opening forecasts show</p> <ul> <li>The FTSE 100 up 3 points</li> <li>Germany\u2019s Dax 20 points higher</li> <li>France\u2019s Cac climbing 8 points</li> <li>Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB up 50 points.</li> </ul> <p>CMC\u2019s chief market analyst Michael Hewson said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[Market] optimism was reinforced by a call from the Five Star movement for Paolo Savona to withdraw his candidacy for the position of finance minister. This would appear to be at odds with the position of the League and its leader Matteo Salvini, whose pick Savona is. The differences of opinion between the two parties certainly don\u2019t bode well for any future relationship in government, if Salvini does change his mind about Savona and put someone else forward as finance minister...<strong> </strong></p> <p>Even though investors have significant concerns about the recent steep rise in Italian borrowing costs it should be noted they still remain well below their long-term averages prior to the financial crisis, when they were on average in and around the 4% level for most of the noughties. This means that while Italian borrowing costs now are high relative to the last few years, they still remain low by historical standards.</p> </blockquote> <p>Still, investors would be right to be cautious. Italy is not the only potential problem in the eurozone, with Spain\u2019s prime minister Rajoy facing a no confidence vote on Friday.</p> <p>On the same day, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/30/trump-administration-tariff-steel-aluminum-eu-trade-tension\">the EU\u2019s temporary exemption from the US steel and aluminium tariffs is due to expire</a> although developments could come as soon as today, while there are also the continuing concerns about a trade war between the US and China, as well the situation in North Korea.</p> <p>It\u2019s set to be a busier day all round, with news already that the UK regulator the Financial Conduct Authority is clamping down on high cost credit.</p> <p>Meanwhile Nationwide\u2019s latest house price index has shown weaker than expected growth in May, with prices up 2.4%, down from a 2.6% increase in April and below the expected figure of 3%. <strong>J</strong>onathan Samuels, chief executive of property lender, Octane Capital, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Tight supply and subdued demand are the key contributors to the ongoing limbo gripping the UK property market.

Other US index were also lower, with the S&amp;P 500 falling for the fourth time in five days. The tariff issue had \u201ccast a pall over the animal spirits,\u201d explained Libby Cantrill, managing director and the head of public policy for PIMCO, on Bloomberg TV. Some investors expressed concerns that trade tariffs could interrupt synchronized global growth. \u201cThe hard thing about protectionism, the hard thing about tariffs and quotas, is that you can almost think of it as it\u2019s a slow moving disease, but it\u2019s deadly,\u201d Kristina Hooper, Invesco\u2019s chief global market strategist, told Bloomberg. \u201cWhen I look at protectionism, I don\u2019t believe the market truly can price it in at this point because there\u2019s still so many potential iterations. But right now it\u2019s certainly moving further to the extremes when it comes to protectionism and that can be very problematic.\u201d That\u2019s code for expect trouble ahead. Thanks for reading \u2013 we\u2019re going to wrap up this blog now. US jobs report on Friday \u2013 stay tuned. South of the border, Mexico\u2019s ministry of economy has also issued a statement, saying it \u201cdeeply regrets and disapproves\u201d the US decision to impose tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum from Mexico as of 1 June but reiterated \u201cits openness to a constructive dialogue with the US\u201d. The statement read in part: \u201cIn response to the decision of the United States to impose tariffs, Mexico will adopt equivalent measures on a variety of products, including flat steel (hot and cold foil, including coated and tubes and pipes), lamps, pork legs and shoulders, sausages and food preparations, apples, grapes, cranberries, various cheeses, and other products, up to an amount comparable to damage caused by the United States\u2019 action. \u201cThis measure will be in force for as long as the US government maintains the imposed tariffs.\u201d Canada\u2019s list of proposed counter measures is here. Freeland concluded her remarks saying: \u201cI want to be very clear about one thing: Americans remain our partners, friends, and allies. This is not about the American people. We have to believe that at some point their common sense will prevail. But we see no sign of that in this action today by the US administration.\u201d Canadian officials said they would impose tariffs against up to C$16.6bn worth of imports of steel, aluminium, whiskey, orange juice and other products from the US. \u201cWe are imposing dollar for dollar tariffs,\u201d said Chrystia Freeland, Canada\u2019s foreign affairs minister. The tariffs are expected to take effect on 1 July. The tariffs violate Nafta and WTO trade rules, added Freeland, who said that Canada plans to launch dispute settlement proceedings under Nafta Chapter 20 and the WTO. Canada\u2019s foreign minister Chrystia Freeland says Canada will impose retaliatory measures against US steel, aluminium and other products \u2013 but subject to a 15-day consultation. Freeland also said Canada would continue to defend \u201cfree, open rule-based trade\u201d but would also challenge US tariffs under both the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Word trade Organisation. Trudeau said the tariffs will harm industries and workers on both sides of the Canada-US border. \u201cThey are an affront to the long-standing security partnership between Canada and the United States, and in particular an affront to the thousands of Canadians who have fought and died alongside their US comrades in arms. The ties of commerce, friendship and in many cases family between Americans and Canadians are undiminished. We are confident that shared values, geography and common interest will ultimately overcome protectionism.\u201d Canada\u2019s prime minister Justin Trudeau has hit back strongly at the imposition of tariffs, calling them \u201c totally unacceptable\u201d at a news conference. French President Emmanuel Macron said the United States\u2019 decision to impose tariffs on European metals exports is illegal and a mistake. The French leader said he would talk to President Donald Trump on the subject later on Thursday Canada\u2019s prime minister Trudeau and Mexico\u2019s president Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto have reportedly spoken and agreed to co-ordinate retaliation efforts... A formal complaint by the EU at the WTO in Geneva is expected tomorrow, Friday. In joint statement the French minister and German finance minister, Bruno la Marie and Peter Altamira, said they regretted the \u201cunilateral decision\u201d taken by the White House and backed the European Commission\u2019s retaliatory response. Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau is expected to speak at 1.30pm ET. In the meantime, we have Kathleen Wynne, the premier of Ontario, who has called Trump a \u201cbully\u201d, describing him as a \u201cman who simply does not seem to get that his bluster and his bullying are costing real people real jobs\u201d. The conservative business network backed by the wealthy industrialist brothers Charles and David Koch has also come out in opposition to the tariffs. Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce and Americans for Prosperity warned there would be a tax increase on all Americans and would undermine the nation\u2019s economy and low unemployment rates. Now for the reaction from Washington\u2026 Kevin Brady, the Texas Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, has said the Trump administration is \u201chitting the wrong target\u201d and officials will need to provide answers to Congress about the damage to US businesses. \u201cWhen it comes to unfairly traded steel and aluminum, Mexico, Canada and Europe are not the problem \u2013 China is. These tariffs are hitting the wrong target.\u201d Brady urged the administration to exempt allies from the new import tariffs. And he warned that administration officials \u201cwill need to come to Capitol Hill to provide answers about the indiscriminate harm these tariffs are causing our local businesses\u201d. Continuing the denunciations of the US decision, Germany\u2019s foreign minister Heiko Maas says the European Union \u201cis ready to react accordingly with counter measure\u201d. As Europe prepares to hit back with tariffs on a list of US exports worth \u20ac6.4 billion ($7.5 billion), Mexico\u2019s economy ministry has said it will target several US goods in response, including some steel and pipe products, lamps, berries, grapes, apples, cold cuts, pork chops and various cheese products \u201cup to an amount comparable to the level of damage\u201d linked to the US tariffs. Canada is also expected to impose retaliatory measures, details of which are expected soon. Adam Marshall, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), called the US move \u201chugely disappointing\u201d and warned that the tariffs \u201cwill hurt companies and communities in many areas of the UK, as well as their customers in the US\u201d. \u201cThe UK government must reach out to and support the many supply chain businesses that face becoming the \u2018collateral damage\u2019 of the Trump administration\u2019s protectionist push. British ministers must also work hand in hand with the EU to avoid any further escalation, and to find a long-term solution.\u201d But he also warned that the US decision to impose punitive tariffs should serve as a reminder that self-interest looms large in trade negotiations. \u201cMinisters should reflect on this carefully before they pursue any future trade deal between the UK and the USA.\u201d More from Boffey: Manfred Weber, the leader of the European People\u2019s Party, the largest group in the European Parliament, and a key ally of the German chancellor, warned that treating the EU as the \u201cenemy\u201d would lead to US consumers hurting too. He said: \u201cEurope does not want a trade conflict. We believe in a fair trade regime from which everybody benefits. We have tried everything to make dialogue and mutual understanding prevail. If President Trump decides to treat Europe as an enemy, we will have no choice but to defend European industry, European jobs, European interests.\u201d But he warned his party would not accept \u201cthis highly regrettable decision without reacting. This will have consequences for the American people too. In a trade conflict there are only losers.\u201d The situation, he added, \u201chas to be a wake-up call for us Europeans.\u201d \u201cWith the US closing in on itself, we should be bridge-builders and reliable partners for the rest of the world. Europe now has to act with a clear message and remain united, calm and proportionate.\u201d Gareth Stace, director of UK Steel, called the US decision \u201ca bad day for the steel sector, for international relations and for free trade.\u201d He said it is vital that the EU and US continue discussions to find a way through the current impasse and reach an agreement that works for all parties. But he called on the EU to forge ahead with safeguard action. And from the Guardian\u2019s political correspondent Jessica Elgot: A UK government spokesman said they were \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d by the outcome. \u201cThe UK and other European Union countries are close allies of the US and should be permanently and fully exempted from the American measures on steel and aluminium,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cWe have made clear to the US government at the highest levels the importance of UK steel and aluminium to its businesses and defence projects. We will continue to work closely with the EU and US Administration to achieve a permanent exemption, and to ensure that UK workers are protected and safeguarded.\u201d May will raise the tariffs with Trump directly when the pair meet at the G7 in Canada next week, where the issue is likely to figure prominently. May has personally lobbied the US president repeatedly in recent weeks and months. The Guardian\u2019s Daniel Boffey from Brussels: Brussels has been preparing a retaliatory hit on an array of US goods, both industrial and agricultural, ranging from Harley Davidson motorbikes to blue jeans and American bourbon. Ambassadors from the 28 member states were in immediate communication with the European Commission following the announcement from the Trump administration. Speaking at a conference in Brussels, Juncker said the EU would launch retaliatory action \u201cin the coming hours\u201d. \u201cThis is a bad day for world trade,\u201d Juncker. \u201cIt\u2019s totally unacceptable that a country is imposing unilateral measures when it comes to world trade. What they can do, we are able to do.\u201d Susan Danger, chief executive of the American Chamber of Commerce to the EU (AmCham EU), said the White House did not have any justification for imposing the tariffs. \u201cAmerican companies in Europe oppose the US government\u2019s decision to impose tariffs on EU imports of steel and aluminium. We urge the US government to revisit its plans and the EU to take a balanced approach in responding to these measures. We are very concerned by the damage a tit-for-tat dispute would cause to the transatlantic economy and its impact on jobs, investment and security across the Atlantic.\u201d Mexico\u2019s Undersecretary of Foreign Trade, Juan Carlos Baker, tweeted: Ram\u00f3n Beltr\u00e1n, the president of Mexico\u2019s National Chamber of the Aluminium Industry, told \u2018Aristegui En Vivo\u2019: \u201cNobody will win [the trade war that is beginning]. The US will lose.\u201d \u201cFrankly, we do not like this at all,\u201d Beltr\u00e1n added. Beltr\u00e1n claimed the US move was designed to pressure Mexico over NAFTA negotiations. \u201c[But] we shouldn\u2019t contaminate one thing with the other.\u201d Mexico\u2019s Secretariat of Economy said it \u201cprofoundly regretted\u201d the US move and announced it would hit back with tariffs on products including including grapes, apples, pork legs and shoulders, blueberries, some cheeses as well as flat steel. \u201cMexico has repeatedly made clear that these kinds of measures based on national security are neither appropriate nor justified,\u201d the secretariat said in a statement. The former Belgian prime minister, and leader of the liberals in the European Parliament, Guy Verhofstadt, said: \u201cUnfortunately, these steps weaken the transatlantic alliance. Instead of imposing punitive tariffs on their closest allies, the US and EU should work together to tackle China\u2019s unfair trading practices.\u201d He continued: \u201cAs with Brexit, what is most important now is unity within the EU. If we are united, we will have a strong position to face this wave of protectionism, which will benefit no one. The EU has proven to be a strong and reliable global trading partner. In recent months, the EU secured major free trade deals with partners like Canada, Japan and Mexico. This shows what we can achieve when Europe speaks with one voice. We need to continue in this spirit and work with partners around the globe to preserve the rules-based multilateral trading system.\u201d In his statement, EU commission president Juncker said: \u201cI am concerned by this decision. The EU believes these unilateral US tariffs are unjustified and at odds with World Trade Organisation rules. This is protectionism, pure and simple. Over the past months we have continuously engaged with the US at all possible levels to jointly address the problem of overcapacity in the steel sector. Overcapacity remains at the heart of the problem and the EU is not the source of but on the contrary equally hurt by it. US equities fell on the news, with the Dow Jones industrial average dropping 250 points. Mexican stocks also fell, while the Mexican peso and Canadian dollar hit their lows of the day against the dollar after news of US tariffs broke. Author and historian Simon Schama has also weighed in, posting on Twitter that \u201cEurope now has to show some real spine or else it will just become Trump\u2019s doormat\u201d. The president of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, has issued a statement and commented on Twitter: \u201cIt\u2019s a bad day for world trade. US leaves us no choice but to proceed with a WTO dispute settlement case and the imposition of additional duties on a number of US imports. We will defend the EU\u2019s interests, in full compliance with international trade law.\u201d Markets have edged into negative territory despite earlier rises on hopes of a resolution to the Italian political crisis. The moves came as the US imposed steel and aluminium tariffs on the EU, Mexico and Canada. Investors are also fretting about other geopolitical problems, including Friday\u2019s vote of no confidence in Spain, the continuing concerns about North Korea and Iran, the prospect of a trade war between the US and China. Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB is currently down 0.13%, while Spain\u2019s Ibex is 0.2% lower and Germany\u2019s Dax is down 0.75%. France\u2019s Cac has managed to edge up 0.03% while the FTSE 100 is 0.18% higher. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 145 points or 0.62%. On the economic front, eurozone inflation came in higher than forecast in May. UK consumer credit rebounded in April, as the City regulator ordered a clampdown on high cost credit. In the US, consumer spending and weekly jobless claims both came in better than expected. Finally, the Bank of England has appointed academic Jonathan Haskel to its rate setting monetary policy committee, the only man on a shortlist of five candidates. US commerce secretary Wilbur Ross has confirmed that it will impose steel and aluminium tariffs on the EU, Canada and Mexico from midnight tonight. The tariffs will be 25% for steel and 10% for aluminium. Amid fears of a trade war, Ross said if any party retaliated that did not rule out further negotiations. He said talks with the EU had made progress, but not enough to continue an exemption from tariffs, which was due to expire tomorrow. While European markets are still just about holding onto gains in the hope that Italy can come up with a plausible government after the recent turmoil, Wall Street has opened lower on worries about trade wars. With the US set to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium from the EU, Canada and Mexico, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 112 points or 0.4%. The S&amp;P 500 opened 0.28% lower and the Nasdaq Composite has lost 0.08%. Here\u2019s our story on the appointment of the only man on a five person shortlist to the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee: The Bank of England interest rate setting committee, which has only one woman among its nine members, will continue to be male-dominated after the Treasury opted to appoint the only man from a shortlist of five candidates. In a move that immediately sparked protests from women\u2019s groups, the chancellor, Philip Hammond, said Jonathan Haskel, an Imperial College economist, would join the Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, on the monetary policy committee (MPC) for a three-year term starting in September, when he will succeed the outgoing Ian McCafferty. The Treasury said four women were on the shortlist, but an internal panel made up of two women and one man chose Haskel as the best candidate. Clare Lombardelli, first female chief economic adviser to the Treasury, chaired the panel. She was joined by the former MPC member Kate Barker and Richard Hughes, the Treasury\u2019s director of fiscal policy. A Women\u2019s Equality party (WEP) spokeswoman said the appointment of Haskel sent the wrong message- about the Treasury\u2019s commitment to improving diversity in important areas of public life. \u201cIt suggests that even if they had an all-female shortlist, they would probably still appoint a man,\u201d she said. The full report is here: Shares in troubled Deutsche Bank are down around 5% following reports that US authorities have put its business in the country on a list of troubled institutions. More signs of the strength of the US economy. Weekly jobless claims fell by more than expected, down 13,000 to a seasonally adjusted 221,000. Analysts had forecast a fall to 228,000. The jobless rate at 3.9% is a near seventeen and a half year low and close to the Federal Reserve\u2019s target of 3.8% by the end of the year. The news comes ahead of Friday\u2019s non-farm payroll report, where economists expect around 188,000 jobs to have been created in May. Meanwhile US consumer spending rose by a higher than expected 0.6% last month, the biggest increase in five months. The forecast was for a 0.4% increase. Back in Italy: Meanwhile over in Spain, the no confidence debate is taking place. Our latest report: The future of the Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, is hanging in the balance as parliament prepares to debate a motion of no-confidence tabled after his Partido Popular (People\u2019s party) was found to have profited from a huge kickbacks-for-contracts scheme. A defiant Rajoy addressed MPs early on Thursday, accusing the opposition Partido Socialista Obrero Espa\u00f1ol (Spanish Socialist Workers\u2019 party) of opportunism and reminding the PSOE of its corruption scandals. \u201cWith what moral authority are you speaking? Are you perhaps Mother Teresa of Calcutta?\u201d he asked. \u201cThere have been corrupt people in the PP, but the PP is not a corrupt party.\u201d The no-confidence vote, scheduled to take place on Friday, is likely to be very close. The PSOE needs the support of 176 of the 350 MPs in congress of deputies. The votes of the five MPs of the Partido Nacionalista Vasco (Basque Nationalist party) will prove decisive, with the PNV saying it would meet and hear what the PSOE leader, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, had to say before announcing its decision. S\u00e1nchez called for \u201cdemocratic regeneration\u201d as he sought the backing of MPs, saying: \u201cResign, Mr Rajoy. Your time is up.\u201d The full story is here: With European markets drifting - but mainly still managing to stay in positive territory - Wall Street is expected to open marginally lower. There is an eerie sense of calm after all the ructions caused by the Italian political crisis, with investors hoping a new government can be formed after all without the need for another election campaign. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, said: Not too long ago, a coalition government in Italy consisting of two eurosceptic populist parties was a feared and unlikely prospect that many believed would majorly concern investors. While much of this remains true, it is also currently viewed as the least unattractive and feasible outcome for markets, with the other alternative being fresh elections and the possibility that the parties are given an even stronger and potentially less euro-friendly mandate. Italy\u2019s President, Sergio Mattarella, may have believed he was acting in the best interest of the country when he rejected to populists choice of Finance Minister but the reality is that in doing so, he has given both parties more ammunition with which to attack the euro. Mattarella has already been accused of acting on behalf of Germany and others while Brussels has been accused of interference, it all feeds very well into the eurosceptics message that the country no longer even has control over its domestic politics. Should the country move straight on to another election, both Five Star Movement and Lega will look to take advantage of any fury linked to perceived meddling and could significantly add to their numbers. All of a sudden, the worst case scenario prior to the election looks tolerable compared to what could come from another. With both parties now in discussions again, there is a hope that the political impasse can be resolved which is helping to lift sentiment in the near-term. That said, a positive outcome now poses many further risks in the long-term. While Italian assets have bore the brunt of the pain from the latest period of political instability and uncertainty, there has been a negative impact on the wider markets including the euro which dropped to a 10-month low against the dollar. While we\u2019re still far away from the days of the debt crisis and the risk of a breakup, a second election was being portrayed as a vote on the euro which seems drastic and probably overhyped but it certainly hit the single currency. Markets are still managing to hold onto their gains - just - on hopes that the Italian political crisis can be resolved before too long. Here is our latest report on the developments: The leader of the Italian far-right party the League, Matteo Salvini, cancelled political rallies to return to Rome early on Thursday, in what was seen as a sign that a weeks-long political impasse that has left the country without a fully-functioning government for months might soon be coming to an end. Salvini was heading back to the capital to meet with his coalition partner, Luigi Di Maio, the 31-year-old head of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, after the Italian president gave the pair more time to form a government. Italian press reports indicated that any agreement to form a new populist government involving the League, formerly known as the Lega Nord, and M5S would include the nomination \u2013 again \u2013 of Giuseppe Conte, a formerly obscure law professor, to serve as prime minister. But the two populists, Di Maio and Salvini, were expected to back down on their earlier insistence that the 81-year-old Eurosceptic Paolo Savona, who had called Italy\u2019s adoption of the euro a \u201chistoric mistake\u201d, serve as finance minister. There were also small indications that the populists would try to assure markets that they were not planning any big moves to try to hasten an Italian exit out of the euro, a fear that roiled markets this week. The full story is here: Given the controversy over the comments from male executives making excuses for why there are now women on their boards, the fact that the new member of the Bank of England\u2019s MPC is male hardly helps matters. Worse - the shortlist for the appointment included four women and one man. And the man was given the job. From the Treasury release: The release also says: The Treasury is committed to appointing a diverse range of people to public appointments, including at the Bank of England. The Treasury continues to work to attract the broadest range of suitable applicants for posts. As part of this recruitment process, the Chief Economic Advisor at the Treasury and chair of the interview panel contacted 87 potential applicants to inform them of the vacancy, of whom 44 were women. Could Haskel also be hawkish? David Owen, chief european financial economist at Jefferies, says: His expertise will also be invaluable when it comes to assessing how much spare capacity there is in the UK economy, as well as trend GDP growth, both key when looking at monetary policy. Jonathan Haskel\u2019s recent book \u201cCapitalism Without Capital: The Rise of the Intangible Economy\u201d highlights the growing use of things that we cannot really measure accurately in the production process in the UK. Everything being equal, this would suggest that labour productivity is stronger than official estimates suggest and like Ian McCafferty (who leaves the BoE in August) will vote for a rate rise when he joins the MPC. The government has appointed Jonathan Haskel, a professor of economics at Imperial College Business School, as the newest member of the Bank of England\u2019s rate setting Monetary Policy Committee. Haskel will serve a three year term as an external member and will start on 1 September, when Ian McCafferty\u2019s term ends. In his Imperial College profile, Haskel says: My main research interests are productivity, innovation, intangible investment and growth. I currently study (a) how much firms investment in \u201cintangible\u201d or \u201cknowledge\u201d assets, such as software, R&amp;D and new business processes (b) how much such investment contributes to economic growth as whole and (c) what public policy implications there might be, especially for science policy. This work uses a mix of data at the levels of company, individual, industry and whole economy. Economist Bert Colijn at ING Bank said the eurozone inflation figure puts the European Central Bank in an awkward position: As this jump in inflation just thinly masks underlying core weakness and uncertainty about the economy is high, it is unlikely to convince the ECB to normalise policy more quickly.... [The] core inflation reading is still below where we would expect it to be with the improving labour market and increased selling prices indicated in business surveys. And, as selling price expectations have been weakening in the recent soft patch of economic data, it does not seem like we are at the start of a marked increase in inflation. The understatement of recent months was also helped by a weakening euro, which dampened some of the effects from the higher oil price. Petrol prices jumped significantly in May, on the back of an oil price of around $80 per barrel for most of the month and a weakening euro. Be careful what you wish for, ECB. After years of pushing for inflation to return to just under 2%, it could not have come at a more difficult time. Eurozone financial market turmoil has returned because of Italian politics this week and it is very difficult to see how the Italian political situation is going to play out. Economic data has been weakening over the past months, and the ECB is eager to determine whether this is just a soft patch. Finally, the US seems on the brink of announcing tariffs on European steel and aluminium, which clouds the exports outlook and could have an additional inflationary impact if the trade conflict gets out of hand. The ECB therefore now has to decide whether it will provide certainty straight away by announcing an extension to QE or take a \u201cwait and see\u201d approach at the June meeting. Then it could just hint at an extension while taking another six weeks to see how the political situation in Italy and the trade conflict with the US play out, and take in more economic data. Eurozone inflation rose by more than expected in May, partly due to the recent surge in oil prices. The increase towards the European Central Bank\u2019s target comes as it wants to run down its stimulus programme, but faces the prospect of market turbulence disturbing its plans. The cost of living in the 19 eurozone countries rose from 1.2% in April to 1.9% in May, according to an initial estimate from Eurostat, higher than the forecasts of around 1.6%. Energy prices rose by 6.1% compared to 2.6% in April, while food was 2.6% higher, uup from 2.4%. Excluding energy and food prices, inflation rose from 1.1% to 1.3%. Meanwhile unemployment in the eurozone fell from 8.6% in March to 8.5% in April. A UK interest rate rise in August is by no means a done deal, says ING Bank economist James Smith. Commenting on the credit figures, he says: It\u2019s not something markets or analysts typically spend much time looking at each month, but the unexpectedly sharp fall in consumer credit in March was probably a key factor in the Bank of England\u2019s decision to keep rates on hold in May. Admittedly the reasons for this sudden decline were fairly unclear, and the latest figures released today show that the amount of unsecured consumer credit supplied fully recovered in April, rising by \u00a31.8 billion. This tentatively suggests that the fall was simply a blip, perhaps related to the wider economic slowdown in March (although it\u2019s not entirely clear why the bad weather would have resulted in such a sharp change). We still think this is a story worth keeping an eye on over the next couple of months. A net 39% of banks said they tightened up on credit availability in the first quarter according to a Bank of England survey. If credit growth were to slow further, it would no doubt be a bad omen for growth - particularly as, of what little spending there has been over the past year, much of it appears to have been financed by borrowing. Meanwhile consumers continue to remain cautious. While household incomes are no longer being squeezed quite as much as before, shoppers are now being confronted with higher petrol prices, and the latest confidence surveys suggest individuals remain pessimistic about the economic situation overall. These cracks forming in the retail sector remain a big risk to the Bank of England outlook. While we are inclined to think policymakers have a preference to hike rates again in August if economic data allows (particularly given the better wage growth trend), this is certainly not a done deal. As one committee member said recently, the cost of waiting a bit longer before hiking rates is relatively low. The independent economist is referring to remarks made earlier this month at at select committee hearing, when Sir Dave said there was a risk households were spending less than the Bank had expected - as reported by the Financial Times (\u00a3). Speaking of credit, there has been a spike in borrowing by UK consumers in April after a slowdown the previous month blamed on the snowy weather. Consumer credit lending rose by a higher than expected \u00a31.832bn, the biggest increase since November 2016, compared to an increase of just \u00a3425m in March. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a rise of \u00a31.3bn. The number of mortgages approved slipped from 62,802 in March to 62,455, less than the expected 63,000. Net mortgage lending rose by \u00a33.894bn. Here\u2019s our story on the Financial Conduct Authority clamping down on high cost credit: The City watchdog is planning a price cap for rent-to-own retailers as part of a crackdown on high-cost credit and overdrafts to save consumers more than \u00a3200m a year. Although stopping short of capping charges on overdrafts, the Financial Conduct Authority outlined a series of measures on Thursday amid growing calls to protect vulnerable consumers. The changes, the result of an 18-month review by the regulator, come as the Bank of England becomes increasingly concerned about rapid growth in personal borrowing, which is returning to levels unseen since the financial crisis. The Hollywood actor Michael Sheen, debt charities and the Labour party have applied significant pressure on the regulator to act. The FCA said it would consider introducing a price cap for the rent-to-own sector, which includes firms such as BrightHouse, from as early as April next year, although it warned it would need to consult on the measure with the industry first. The full report is here: More positive news for Italy: Germany\u2019s Dax has dipped into the red but other European markets are holding up as investors await the latest developments in the Italian political crisis. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Further steps in the right direction in regards to Italy avoiding another snap election \u2013 even if it does result in the Five Star Movement and League parties forming a Eurosceptic government \u2013 allowed the European markets to hold steady on Thursday. Rising 0.4% the euro managed to put a bit more distance between it and the 10 month lows it struck against the dollar on Tuesday night, the single currency climbing back towards $1.17 after the bell. Against the pound it was a bit more sluggish; however, flat at just under \u20ac1.14, it is trading at the top end of its recent bracket. The Eurozone indices, meanwhile, were broadly positive as well. Though the DAX dipped into the red, the CAC and FTSE MIB both continued to rise, the latter especially expressing its relief that things \u2013 for now, at least \u2013 appear to be calming down. It\u2019ll be interesting to see what role the Eurozone\u2019s May inflation reading plays in the day\u2019s trading. The surge in oil prices means analysts are expecting a sharp month-on-month jump, from 1.2% to 1.6%; that could give the euro a bit more room to breathe, but only if investors are willing to overlook the fact that the increase isn\u2019t really due to anything going on in the Eurozone. Italian bond yields - which soared on Tuesday as the price fell on political concerns - continue to fall back. The two year yield is now down at 0.9% as calm returns - for the moment at least. Two days ago the yield hit 2.84%. Australian shares ended the month on a positive note, helped by the hopes for a solution to the Italian crisis and a rise in mining shares on the back of higher commodity prices. The S&amp;P/AX index rose 0.5% on the day, helping it to a similar increase for the month as a whole. Markets are likely to remain volatile, says Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com: European equities are firmer in early trade and yesterday\u2019s rebound for stocks may well hold if we see the two populists form a government, though longer term any such government faces a clash with the EU/ECB. They may also face a considerable backlash from bond markets again \u2013 calm for the moment \u2013 if they push ahead with plans to increase debt-to-GDP... Reports this morning suggest Paolo Savona could become foreign minister in a Lega-M5S government, a move that could be palatable for all the sides. In the near term the avoidance of snap elections would be positive for risk, but longer-term concerns remain. It does look as though the main risk being priced in earlier this week when bonds and stocks sold off sharply was the threat of another election that could have been framed in a more anit-EU light. Again we must reiterate that stock and bond markets will remain volatile and highly sensitive to the political situation in Rome. Added to this we have the prospect of a no-confidence vote in Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy, a move that would likely bring down the centre-right government. The debate, which starts today, adds to investor concerns that Europe is in a very rocky patch politically at the moment. It is indeed a positive start for European markets, albeit a slightly tentative one given all the geopolitical tensions at the moment. With hopes of a resolution to the Italian political impasse, the country\u2019s FTSE MIB is up 0.38%, while Germany\u2019s Dax is 0.12% better and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.18%. In the UK, the FTSE 100 is up 0.19%. Economist Paul Donovan at UBS said: We are not back to normal, but markets have reacquainted themselves with what normal might look like. Italian bond yields fell and the euro recovered yesterday. A consensus is forming that there will not be elections in Italy until September at the earliest. Italian President Mattarella is waiting to see if the two anti-parties can in fact form a coalition. Ahead of the eurozone inflation figure we have had an update from France. Reuters reports: French inflation rose in May to its highest level since August 2012, according to data from the INSEE national statistics agency, adding to a raft of strong inflation readings across the euro zone as the European Central Bank considers whether or not to tighten its monetary policy. French consumer prices rose from April due partly to higher energy and food prices. The year-on-year inflation rate came in at 2.3 percent, according to EU-harmonised data from INSEE, above a forecast for an inflation reading of 2.0 percent according to a Reuters poll. Earlier this week, data had also shown inflation in Germany, the euro zone\u2019s biggest economy, surging more than expected in May to its highest level in more than a year, while data also showed inflation picking up in Spain. Germany\u2019s May inflation of 2.2 percent also surpassed the European Central Bank\u2019s (ECB) target of just under 2 percent for the euro zone as a whole. ING Bank economist James Smith says the UK credit numbers could be interesting: Here\u2019s more on the Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s clampdown on high cost credit. FCA chief executive Andrew Bailey said: High-cost credit is used by over three million consumers in the UK, some of who are the most vulnerable in society. Today we have proposed a significant package of reforms to ensure they are better protected including the possibility of a cap on rent-to-own lending. The proposals will benefit overdraft and high-cost credit users, rebalancing in the favour of the customer. Here is the full FCA announcement. Eurozone inflation is expected to move sharply higher, partly due to the recent surge in oil prices. UniCredit economists said: We expect headline inflation to rebound strongly in May, from 1.2% to 1.8% year on year. We see two main drivers: a rebound in core inflation and a jump in energy prices. Core inflation probably reversed its April drop and rose to 1.1% year on year from 0.7%. This would reflect normalization in the price of holiday-sensitive items, with the April reading having been distorted to the downside by the early timing of Easter. Surging oil prices are likely to push energy prices up strongly, adding 0.3 percentage points to headline inflation . Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Optimism that the Italian political crisis can be resolved without new elections is expected to see markets continue their revival today. The 5 Star and Lega parties are making renewed efforts to form a coalition, which has eased fears that a new vote could give a mandate for the country to leave the euro - Italexit or Quitaly, take your pick. So Italian bond yields have fallen back from their highs earlier in the week, while European markets are expected to make a positive start. CMC Markets UK\u2019s opening forecasts show The FTSE 100 up 3 points Germany\u2019s Dax 20 points higher France\u2019s Cac climbing 8 points Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB up 50 points. CMC\u2019s chief market analyst Michael Hewson said: [Market] optimism was reinforced by a call from the Five Star movement for Paolo Savona to withdraw his candidacy for the position of finance minister. This would appear to be at odds with the position of the League and its leader Matteo Salvini, whose pick Savona is. The differences of opinion between the two parties certainly don\u2019t bode well for any future relationship in government, if Salvini does change his mind about Savona and put someone else forward as finance minister... Even though investors have significant concerns about the recent steep rise in Italian borrowing costs it should be noted they still remain well below their long-term averages prior to the financial crisis, when they were on average in and around the 4% level for most of the noughties. This means that while Italian borrowing costs now are high relative to the last few years, they still remain low by historical standards. Still, investors would be right to be cautious. Italy is not the only potential problem in the eurozone, with Spain\u2019s prime minister Rajoy facing a no confidence vote on Friday. On the same day, the EU\u2019s temporary exemption from the US steel and aluminium tariffs is due to expire although developments could come as soon as today, while there are also the continuing concerns about a trade war between the US and China, as well the situation in North Korea. It\u2019s set to be a busier day all round, with news already that the UK regulator the Financial Conduct Authority is clamping down on high cost credit. Meanwhile Nationwide\u2019s latest house price index has shown weaker than expected growth in May, with prices up 2.4%, down from a 2.6% increase in April and below the expected figure of 3%. Jonathan Samuels, chief executive of property lender, Octane Capital, said: Tight supply and subdued demand are the key contributors to the ongoing limbo gripping the UK property market. A lethargic economy populated by cautious and squeezed consumers has created a property market lacking both momentum and direction. And on the corporate front, the chief executive of train and bus business FirstGroup is leaving with immediate effect. As the company reported a poor set of results, Tim O\u2019Toole said: The time is right for me to step aside. Today\u2019s results clear the way for the new approach sought by our Chairman and the Board. Investors will also be watching out for European inflation figures after Wednesday\u2019s higher than expected consumer price index from Germany.

The tariffs will cover steel and aluminium as well as orange juice, whiskey and other food products. </p> <p>With the White House having used national security legislation to introduce the tariffs, Trudeau called the measures an \u201caffront\u201d to Canadians who had fought alongside their American comrades in arms. \u201cThat Canada could be considered a national security threat to the US is inconceivable.\u201d</p> <p>Canada\u2019s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, went further calling her country\u2019s $16.6bn retaliatory tariffs \u201cthe strongest trade action Canada has taken in the postwar era. This is a very strong response.

          "bodyText": "The United States and its traditional allies are on the brink of a full-scale trade war after European and Canadian leaders reacted swiftly and angrily to Donald Trump\u2019s decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium producers. The president of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, promised immediate retaliation after the US commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, said EU companies would face a 25% duty on steel and a 10% duty on aluminium from midnight on Thursday. Europe, along with Canada and Mexico, had been granted a temporary reprieve from the tariffs after they were unveiled by Donald Trump two months ago. However, Ross sent shudders through global financial markets when he said insufficient progress had been made in talks with three of the US\u2019s traditional allies to reduce America\u2019s trade deficit and that the waiver was being lifted. Wall Street slumped as the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down more than 250 points as investors sold off shares in manufacturers and corporations with global reach. Shares across Europe also declined. The move from Washington \u2013 which comes at a time when Trump is also threatening protectionist action against China \u2013 triggered an immediate and angry response from Canada, Brussels and from individual European capitals. Juncker called the US move \u201cunjustified\u201d and said the EU had no choice but to hit back with tariffs on US goods and a case at the World Trade Organisation in Geneva. \u201cWe will defend the Union\u2019s interests, in full compliance with international trade law,\u201d he added. Brussels has already announced that it would target Levi\u2019s jeans, Harley-Davidson motorbikes and bourbon whiskey. The UK, which has hopes of agreeing a trade liberalisation deal with the US after Brexit, expressed alarm at Ross\u2019s announcement. Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, said Britain would not rule out countermeasures or taking Washington to the WTO, which arbitrates on global trade disputes. Speaking to Sky News he attacked the tariffs as \u201cpatently absurd\u201d and urged the US to think again. \u201cIt would be a great pity if we ended up in a tit-for-tat trade dispute with our closest allies.\u201d A spokesman for Number 10 said the government was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d the US had decided to apply the tariffs and that Theresa May would raise the issue with Trump at next week\u2019s meeting of the G7 industrial nations in Canada. \u201cThe UK and other European Union countries are close allies of the US and should be permanently and fully exempted from the American measures on steel and aluminium.\u201d The French president, Emmanuel Macron, called the US tariffs illegal and a mistake, while the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, issued an immediate like-for-like response \u2013 announcing tariffs of up to 25% on US imports worth up to 16.6bn Canadian dollars (\u00a39.6bn), which was the total value of Canadian steel exports to the US last year. The tariffs will cover steel and aluminium as well as orange juice, whiskey and other food products. With the White House having used national security legislation to introduce the tariffs, Trudeau called the measures an \u201caffront\u201d to Canadians who had fought alongside their American comrades in arms. \u201cThat Canada could be considered a national security threat to the US is inconceivable.\u201d Canada\u2019s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, went further calling her country\u2019s $16.6bn retaliatory tariffs \u201cthe strongest trade action Canada has taken in the postwar era. This is a very strong response. It is a proportionate response, it is perfectly reciprocal ... this is a very strong Canadian action in response to a very bad US decision.\u201d Mexico also denounced the move, saying it \u201cdeeply regrets and disapproves\u201d the US decision. The economics minstry said it would adopt equivalent measures on a variety of products, including flat steel, lamps, pork legs and shoulders, sausages and food preparations, apples, grapes, cranberries, various cheeses, and other products, \u201cup to an amount comparable to damage caused by the United States\u2019 action\u201d. It added: \u201cThis measure will be in force for as long as the US government maintains the imposed tariffs.\u201d Hopes remain that the fallout could be contained.

Fipas are Canada\u2019s name for bilateral investment treaties, which are frequently used by corporations around the world to challenge public policies or community decisions that interfere with their ability to make money. Canada\u2019s first Fipa took the form of a single chapter in the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). Since then, <a href=\"https://www.citizen.org/sites/default/files/naftareport_final.pdf\">Canada has paid out $160m to US corporations</a> who challenged public decisions, including environmental policy.

First are many of Canada\u2019s First Nations groups, who don\u2019t want their land used for this purpose without their permission, and who fear the effects of oil spills on the oceans and forests they depend on. Second are the residents of Canada\u2019s west coast, who don\u2019t want hundreds of additional tankers plying the narrow inlets around Vancouver on the theory that eventually there\u2019s going to be an oil spill. And third are climate scientists, who point out that even if Trudeau\u2019s pipeline doesn\u2019t spill oil into the ocean, it will spill carbon into the atmosphere.</p> <p>Lots of carbon: Trudeau told oil executives last year that \u201cno country would find 173bn barrels of oil in the ground and just leave it there\u201d. That\u2019s apparently how much he plans to dig up and burn \u2013 and if he\u2019s successful, the one half of 1% of the planet that is Canadian will have awarded to itself almost one-third of the remaining carbon budget between us and the 1.5 degree rise in temperature the planet drew as a red line in Paris.

Hell, than Saudi Arabians. </p> <p>Is this a clever financial decision that will somehow make Canada rich? Certainly not in the long run. Cleaning up the tar sands complex in Alberta \u2013 the biggest, ugliest scar on the surface of the earth \u2013 is already estimated to cost more than the total revenues generated by all the oil that\u2019s come out of the ground. Meanwhile, when something goes wrong, Canada is now on the hook: when BP tarred the Gulf of Mexico, the US was at least able to exact billions of dollars in fines to help with the cleanup. Canada will get to sue itself.</p> <p>No, this is simply a scared prime minister playing politics. He\u2019s worried about the reaction in Alberta if the pipe is not built, and so he has mortgaged his credibility. His predecessor, Stephen Harper, probably would not have dared try \u2013 the outcry from environmentalists and First Nations would have been too overwhelming. But Trudeau is banking on the fact that his liberal charm will soothe things over.

Faced with the same situation \u2013 a revolt over the Keystone XL pipeline \u2013 Barack Obama delayed for several years to avoid antagonizing either side. He ultimately decided he couldn\u2019t defend the climate cost of building it, and so became the first world leader to explicitly reject a big piece of infrastructure on global warming grounds.

          "body": "<p>If there\u2019s one thing that hit Netflix show The Good Place is absolutely, definitely not about, it\u2019s The State of the World Today. Intentionally, anyway. For one thing, this feelgood sitcom isn\u2019t even set in our world, but in a non-denominational afterlife you might call \u201cHeaven\u201d. This is the Good Place of the title, where Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) finds herself in the show\u2019s opening episode and soon concludes she\u2019s been sent in error. </p> <p>The Good Place is for the likes of beautiful philanthropist Tahani (Jameela Jamil), silent Buddhist monk Jianyu (Manny Jacinto) and earnest ethics professor Chidi (William Jackson Harper). Eleanor, on the other hand, is the kind of garbage person who reads Celebrity Baby Plastic Surgery Disasters magazine and sells fake medicine to the elderly for a living. Still, understandably, she wants to stay, so spends most of season one trying to keep her secret from Michael (Ted Danson), the angel-architect overseeing the Good Place neighbourhood.</p> <p>The other point is that The Good Place was midway through its first season on NBC when the 2016 US presidential election took place. Even after the world entered into its Trumpian twilight zone, The Good Place\u2019s showrunner, Michael Schur, was keen to ensure his writing team did not get sidetracked: \u201cWe talked a lot in the room about, this is not a show about Donald Trump,\u201d he told New York magazine before the season two premiere last year. \u201cThese characters are dead. These characters don\u2019t even know that Donald Trump is president.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ef24d2d07cf913ac6bd5e268caa26cddf2cab48\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ef24d2d07cf913ac6bd5e268caa26cddf2cab48/0_86_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kristen Bell as Eleanor and Ted Danson as Michael.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kristen Bell as Eleanor and Ted Danson as Michael.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ron Batzdorff/NBC/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most importantly, though, The Good Place couldn\u2019t be about Trump, Brexit, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/22/windrush-scandal-forgetting-black-britons-like-me-british-history\">Windrush</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/metoo?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Ehashtag\">#MeToo</a> or any other contemporary talking point, because that\u2019s exactly the sort of thing that fans watched the show to escape. While for some, The Handmaid\u2019s Tale was a perfectly timed misery-watch, this show offered the opposite sort of distraction. By 2017, political drama and comedy were on the wane in TV generally, with once-popular shows such as Veep, Scandal and House of Cards all either cancelled or embarking on final seasons. Schur, meanwhile, was known and loved as the creator of optimistic, easy-watching sitcoms that found silliness and fundamental decency in the lives of local government officials (Parks and Recreation) and police officers (Brooklyn Nine-Nine). The Good Place, with its pastel hues and twee, euphemistic cursing was his most whimsically escapist yet.</p> <p>Or so it seemed, right up until the season one finale, which first aired on 19 January 2017, the night before Trump\u2019s inauguration. This was the episode in which \u2013 plot twist! \u2013 Eleanor discovered that Michael (Danson) wasn\u2019t an angel-architect, but a demon-bureaucrat who\u2019d been messing with them all along. It wasn\u2019t just Eleanor who belonged in the Bad Place (AKA Hell), but Tahani, Chidi and Jianyu (actually another imposter called Jason) too. And, what\u2019s more, they were already there. They had been obligingly torturing each other as part of Michael\u2019s reality TV-meets-Sartre experiment since episode one. As Eleanor\u2019s catchphrase-coining moment of realisation had it: \u201cThis is the Bad Place!\u201d</p> <p>This phrase chimed with viewers experiencing their own state of post-election shock. Kristen Bell saying \u201cThis is the Bad Place\u201d soon became a liberal meme \u2013 applied, most recently, to Trump retweeting Kanye. \u201cI frequently get messages with that line,\u201d says Vivienne Parent, who runs @nocontexttgp, a Good Place Twitter fan account that has 72,000 followers. \u201cI think it\u2019s a perfect line to describe the swift change from an Obama presidency to a Trump presidency.\u201d</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t just repetition and aptness that made the phrase stick, however. Part of the reason The Good Place\u2019s twist had impact is because audiences didn\u2019t have this down as a \u201cplot twist\u201d kind of show. It relied on the audience\u2019s comfortable complacency, and encouraged viewers to retrospectively reflect on how they\u2019d been so thoroughly duped. In the same way, perhaps, that those non-voters or Hillary voters who\u2019d once confidently dismissed a Trump presidency as an inconceivable joke were now considering their inadvertent complicity in paving his path to the White House.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2e62553b26f7fd61626c36e369d0f4e8ab33238d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e62553b26f7fd61626c36e369d0f4e8ab33238d/0_146_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jameela Jamil as Tahani.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jameela Jamil as Tahani.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colleen Hayes/NBC/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Good Place was subverting some sitcom conventions but it was also embracing others. One of the genre\u2019s defining features is a situation and characters that never fundamentally change. Whatever happens in an episode, however high the stakes, you are always by the next episode, or certainly by the next series, back to square one. Will and Grace still live together, Maggie Simpson never outgrows her dummy, Del Boy never makes his fortune (until the end), and whatever the news agenda throws at the United States, Trump is somehow still president. This may go some way to explaining how The Good Place continues to work as a light sitcom, even as it fearlessly explores weighty philosophical conundrums and peels back the layers of liberal self-delusion. \u201cIt can be both,\u201d says Jason Sutherland, Parent\u2019s co-host on Forkin\u2019 Bullshirt: The Good Place Podcast. \u201cYou can shut off your brain, watch some lovable band of misfits try to become better people and sneak into eternal happiness. [But] if you take a moment and think, you begin to see parallels.\u201d</p> <p>For a Canadian like Sutherland, deep readings needn\u2019t stop at the US border. \u201cMany feel like Justin Trudeau is a great face for Canada. He\u2019s photogenic and charismatic. He shows up at all the important rallies, events, parades, and says the right things when the relevant people are listening, but behind the scenes promises aren\u2019t being kept, millions are scratching their heads. The Good Place neighbourhood is Canada, and Michael is Trudeau in this simulation.\u201d</p> <p>So while The Good Place is TV for liberals the world over, it isn\u2019t TV that\u2019s unchallenging of liberal attitudes. Note that the individual traits for which \u201cTeam Cockroach\u201d (a title Eleanor gives the quartet following a Michael quip) have been eternally damned, also happen to be the traits conservatives most disparage in their defeated foe: Tahani\u2019s smug condescension; Chidi\u2019s indecisive idealism; Jason\u2019s obliviousness; and Eleanor\u2019s ironic detachment. Only the most diabolically manipulative reality TV producer could have cast four more apt personality types for the times we live in, and this meta-commentary on the TV medium is part of the joke too, right? With Ted Danson\u2019s Michael meting out punishment and judgment in the manner of an Apprentice-era Donald Trump? In his New York interview, Schur denied that he\u2019d named Michael after himself in order to make just this point, citing the gatekeeping role of the archangel Michael in Christian theology: \u201cMy initial response was, \u2018Ha, ha, ha, you fools. No, there\u2019s a much more complicated and intellectual, historical reason for the reason he\u2019s named Michael,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then after a while I was like, \u2018Well, maybe they\u2019re right.\u2019 Maybe in the world of literary criticism, the author\u2019s intentions are often seen as irrelevant. Maybe subliminally somewhere, that was the reason I chose that name.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, none of the show was consciously intended to reflect the world we find ourselves in. But then it seems TV, much like the Almighty, works in mysterious ways.</p> <h2>Five Mike Schur show tropes</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e3f0d7b60fa90bc5ed2df5c9ba74044db2fb4ff8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e3f0d7b60fa90bc5ed2df5c9ba74044db2fb4ff8/0_206_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Parks and Recreation.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Parks and Recreation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Haston/NBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>1.</strong><strong> Fantastic job security<br></strong>Schur is the auteur of the workplace comedy, having written some of the most memorable episodes of the American version of The Office and created Parks and Recreation and Brooklyn Nine-Nine, both about a group of oddball co-workers. Even when he tried to break the mould with The Good Place, a complex, twist-filled sitcom about the afterlife, the show basically wound up being an office-based sitcom about middle-manager demons in hell trying to cut through red tape to find the best way to torture humans. In all these shows, the offices are all staffed by eccentric oddballs who want to do literally anything other than their day job, yet somehow they almost never get fired. Even when the entire staff of The Office sack-off work to create the Games of the 1st Dunder Mifflin Olympiad \u2013 including \u201cflonkerton\u201d, a race to see who can run the fastest with boxes of paper strapped to their feet \u2013 they\u2019re always back at work next week without so much as a formal warning.</p> <p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Those same old faces<br></strong>Schur has a cast of actors who follow him round the schedules, although they often go through a total personality transplant to avoid any confusion. Adam Scott, a lovable boardgame enthusiast in Parks and Rec, becomes a mansplaining demon who loves talking about his dumps in The Good Place. Kristen Bell, Rashida Jones and Nick Offerman all make similar volte-faces, but a special mention is reserved for Jason Mantzoukas. He plays Dennis Feinstein, a deranged perfumier who likes to hunt humans in Parks and Recreation; Adrian Pimento, a cop returning from 12 years undercover and struggling with return to non-mafia life in Brooklyn Nine-Nine; and Derek, a computer-generated rebound boyfriend that takes corporeal form in The Good Place. Quite the range.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a9ddba95015c1a588e7e463d67b7da48deb32d71\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9ddba95015c1a588e7e463d67b7da48deb32d71/745_0_1600_2000/800.jpg\" alt=\"Terry Crews, Stephanie Beatriz and Andy Samberg in Brooklyn Nine-Nine.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Terry Crews, Stephanie Beatriz and Andy Samberg in Brooklyn Nine-Nine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fox/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>3.</strong><strong> In-jokes galore<br></strong>Schur comedies are simple enough that if you just drop in on the odd episode, you can pick up what\u2019s going on fairly quickly, but they provide most reward for those that stay loyal. Like how in every episode of The Office, you can see the certificate Michael proudly hangs in his office, not a diploma but his \u201cSeyko\u201d watch certificate of authenticity. The Parks season six finale involved a giant festival in tribute to all the callbacks from the show: the 90s rock band Letters to Cleo played after Ben wore their T-shirt once; a throwaway mention to Donna\u2019s cousin being the R&amp;B singer Ginuwine meant that he took the stage to perform Pony; and there was a tribute to Li\u2019l Sebastian, the town\u2019s celebrity mini-horse.</p> <p><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Universalism<br></strong>Very eagle-eyed viewers have spotted small references to Schur\u2019s sitcoms taking place in the same universe. In The Good Place, there are adverts for Dennis Feinstein\u2019s perfumes on the back of one of Eleanor\u2019s magazines. Parks was originally going to begin with a photocopier being shipped from Dunder Mifflin to Pawnee \u2013 although Schur later decided to scrap that, wanting the shows to stand alone. Basically, he won\u2019t be happy until Reddit pat him on the back and give him a gold star for Easter eggs.</p> <p><strong>5.</strong><strong> Good sitcom values<br></strong>The modern sitcom, typified by Curb Your Enthusiasm, involves essentially awful people getting away, to various degrees, with their shitty behaviour. That kind of thing is not acceptable in Schurland. Running through all his shows is an unambiguous moral code \u2013 based around friendship, collaboration and principle \u2013 to which every character, no matter how oddball, ends up adhering. Leslie Knope is a dogged defender of her community and the Brooklyn Nine-Nine precinct always end up putting a commitment to the law above their personal lives. The Good Place takes this philosophy to its extremes, assigning a numerical value to every Schur-positive and Schur-negative act and using that as a grand unifying theory for who gets into heaven and hell. In a world of ambiguity, you can always be certain who to root for in Schurland. <em>Sam Wolfson</em></p>",

In the summer of 2015, while dealing with the vermin in their new home of Edmonton, he\u2019d learned through a social worker that Canadians apparently loved camping, and so, as a new Canadian, he thought that perhaps this was something he should try.</p> <p>Camping was a new concept to this refugee born and raised in Hama, Syria, site of the Hama massacre of 1982, when the military rounded up 10,000 or 20,000 or 40,000 people for execution (nobody really knows). His father and uncles were spared, but El Hindawi, who was six then, never shed the trauma and bitterness. </p> <p>His whole life has been a struggle, from his early 20s when he lost his firstborn son to measles, right up until 13 November 2014, the day he boarded a plane and flew to Canada \u2013 a country he\u2019d never learned about in public school. His life remained a struggle, because he had six kids crying every night, a wife telling him they\u2019d be better off on the streets, and a family panicking over a blood-sucking insect they\u2019d never encountered before. So, yes, camping, whatever camping was, sounded like a great idea.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/guardian-selects/v1/embed.html?colour-scheme=news&amp;headline=%E2%80%98God%20Knows%20What%20Canada%20Is%E2%80%99%3A%20What%20It%E2%80%99s%20Really%20Like%20to%20Be%20a%20Refugee&amp;headlineLink=http%3A%2F%2Feighteenbridges.com%2Fstory%2Fgod-knows-what-canada-is-what-it-is-really-like-to-be-a-refugee%2F&amp;publine=Eighteen%20Bridges&amp;pubLink=http%3A%2F%2Feighteenbridges.com%2F&amp;reason=This%20poignant%2C%20thoughtful%20portrait%20examines%20the%20lives%20of%20a%20Syrian%20refugee%20family%20in%20Canada%2C%20and%20how%20they%20mirror%20the%20writer\u2019s%20own%20experience%20as%20a%20son%20of%20a%20Muslim%20immigrant.%20Since%20the%20election%20of%20Trump%2C%20Canada%20has%20often%20been%20held%20up%20as%20North%20America\u2019s%20last%20liberal%20sanctuary%3A%20tolerant%2C%20multicultural%20and%20welcoming%20of%20immigrants.%20But%20what%20do%20these%20experiences%20say%20about%20Canadianness--or%20Canada%3F%0A\" data-alt=\".\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/guardian-selects/v1/embed.html?colour-scheme=news&headline=%E2%80%98God%20Knows%20What%20Canada%20Is%E2%80%99%3A%20What%20It%E2%80%99s%20Really%20Like%20to%20Be%20a%20Refugee&headlineLink=http%3A%2F%2Feighteenbridges.com%2Fstory%2Fgod-knows-what-canada-is-what-it-is-really-like-to-be-a-refugee%2F&publine=Eighteen%20Bridges&pubLink=http%3A%2F%2Feighteenbridges.com%2F&reason=This%20poignant%2C%20thoughtful%20portrait%20examines%20the%20lives%20of%20a%20Syrian%20refugee%20family%20in%20Canada%2C%20and%20how%20they%20mirror%20the%20writer\u2019s%20own%20experience%20as%20a%20son%20of%20a%20Muslim%20immigrant.%20Since%20the%20election%20of%20Trump%2C%20Canada%20has%20often%20been%20held%20up%20as%20North%20America\u2019s%20last%20liberal%20sanctuary%3A%20tolerant%2C%20multicultural%20and%20welcoming%20of%20immigrants.%20But%20what%20do%20these%20experiences%20say%20about%20Canadianness--or%20Canada%3F%0A\">.</a> </figure>  <p>I met El Hindawi on the first sub-zero day of the fall of 2015, at a workshop at Edmonton\u2019s Catholic Social Services, sponsored by the government of Canada, to teach new Canadians about the ancient western art of roughing it in the woods. Along with his wife and kids, he was there to learn, and I was there as a reporter to tell a warm story about immigrants. The 43rd Canadian federal election was a month away and it seemed, at least in the moment, that more than global warming, healthcare, trade, taxes and pipelines, the most important issue to Canadians was Canadian-ness itself, and whether someone like El Hindawi, or his hijab-wearing wife, Nisreene, had and/or deserved the right to call themselves Canadian.</p> <p>This debate, however, was all but invisible to the country\u2019s new residents, who could hardly speak their new language, let alone read the news. If there was time between English school, job-hunting, and caring for an infant, three small children and two teens \u2013 all while relying upon a confusing public transit system \u2013 then that time was spent following the tragic unravelling of their homeland, not the comparatively minor issue of an election they couldn\u2019t vote in.</p> <p>El Hindawi, a middle-class petroleum mechanic in Hama, was involved in anti-government activism for much of their last decade in Syria (against the wishes of Nisreene, who feared for their family). In 2011, when the rebellion began, he gave his vacant rental property to a group of rogue medical professionals who treated injured protesters. He believes a recaptured survivor was the one who ratted on him in March 2012, forcing El Hindawi to flee to Lebanon in a taxi with a friend\u2019s ID. The driver returned two weeks later with the rest of the family, who paid border guards $200 to open the gate.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Sure, I\u2019ll go to Canada, even though I don\u2019t know what it is or where it is</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>They lived in an apartment with sporadic water supply, surviving off a paltry United Nations allowance and the charity of a friend abroad and some Lebanese, though they found many of their new neighbours to be unwelcoming of refugees. It took 18 months for the UN to resettle them. On a Wednesday morning, he got the call. They were going to Canada \u2013 the next day. \u201cSure, I\u2019ll go to Canada, even though I don\u2019t know what it is or where it is,\u201d Mohammed would later tell me through a translator. \u201cGood \u2013 I just want to bring my family to survive, and God knows what\u2019s Canada.\u201d</p> <p>First impressions: Canada is cold, which he assumed when he was given a winter coat on arrival, but didn\u2019t fully comprehend until the frost hit his cheeks outside Edmonton international airport. Canada is also expensive; by spring their savings of $9,400 were gone.</p> <p>But Canada is caring, too. An Arab business-owner hired El Hindawi on a construction site, though language difficulties and arthritis meant he was unable to keep the job. Insomnia didn\u2019t help either, but a doctor diagnosed him with depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, and he\u2019s now receiving treatment for it. They were heartened by the generosity of Edmonton\u2019s Capital Region Housing Corporation, which sheltered the large family at a subsidized rate of just $550 a month. But then came the infestation. Bedbugs. It made it even harder to sleep at night. It made the children miserable. It caused a rift between the parents.</p> <p>Before leaving the camping workshop, El Hindawi showed me pictures of the red pocks on the back of his newborn \u2013 the first second generation Canadian for these first generation parents \u2013 and asked me to help. It seemed like a worthwhile human interest story for my newspaper, so I took his phone number to pass on to my editor. A week later, another reporter came to his home to write about their living conditions, which turned out to be quite complicated.</p> <h2>\u2018I\u2019ve never cried in public, but when I read them I cried\u2019</h2> <p>Numerous health inspectors who\u2019d come to their duplex had deemed it safe. The landlord had sprayed repeatedly for vermin and the El Hindawis had purged the space of any possibly infested object (meaning yet another loss of worldly possessions). </p> <p>Still, the pocks returned. There were few affordable housing options for the family of eight, the most recent inspection found no evidence of bedbugs and the landlord had been taking the complaints seriously. When the facts were laid out in the story and published on the cover of Metro News, an army of online commentators turned El Hindawi\u2019s family into ammunition for their anti-immigrant campaign.</p> <p>\u201cIngrates\u201d, \u201cqueue-jumpers\u201d and \u201cGO HOME!!!\u201d were typical comments. \u201cHow about you go out and get a job Mohammed?\u201d read another. The newspaper deleted and closed the comments section, but not before El Hindawi himself had them read to him. The malice was aggregated and proliferated by alt-right media sites such as The Rebel, owned by Alberta\u2019s infamous and Islamophobic pundit Ezra Levant. The case of the ungrateful and troublesome El Hindawis was used by such sites as clear evidence that Canada needed to keep refugees out.</p> <p>There were sympathetic readers, some of whom called the newspaper to help, but the harsh words still came as a shock to El Hindawi. \u201cI\u2019ve never cried in public, but when I read them I cried,\u201d he said. \u201cI lost my father and my son, but I never cried like that. They hurt me so badly. Their words just touched my soul.\u201d This was not the fair and tolerant Canada the settlement agents told him he was bringing his family to.</p> <p>But it is his Canada, our Canada, a democracy founded on and propagated through various undemocratic practices\u2013 cultural genocide, papal bulls, bad-faith treaties \u2013 always with the white euro-Christian norm at the centre of the effort to safeguard itself from \u201cthe other\u201d, whoever that might be.</p> <p>Ancient Greeks called the others they encountered \u201cbarbarians\u201d. Islamic crusaders then (and now, in the form of Isis) called them \u201cinfidels\u201d. In the US and Canada, we have many words but generally adhere to the politest one: immigrants. Though the majority of Canadians welcome this \u201cother\u201d, defend this other and identify with this other (because to be a land of one we must be a land of others), they might still distrust this other. And currently, no other in this country is distrusted more than the one who looks like an El Hindawi.</p> <p>An Angus Reid survey of national attitudes toward religions showed more Canadians have negative than neutral views of Muslims, and it is a big gap down to the next religion on the list. Prejudice against Islam is highest in Quebec, where two-thirds admit to it, and where six Muslim men were gunned down in the middle of prayer last January by a white nationalist who cultivated a pro-Trump fanaticism online. The massacre happened the weekend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/27/donald-trump-muslim-refugee-ban-executive-action\">Donald Trump signed an executive order</a> enacting a legal version of his promised \u201cMuslim Ban\u201d, motivated by fears of an Islamic takeover \u201clike Europe\u201d, said the shooter. </p> <p>But such a tragedy was probably inevitable, Trump or no. Though hate crimes in general are declining, they are not declining against Canada\u2019s one million Muslims. In fact, they have more than doubled between 2012 and 2014. These are numbers reported before Trump, before Brexit, before the Burka Ban and Barbaric Cultural Practises hotline. Before Nice and San Bernadino. Before Orlando and Berlin. \u201cSomeday something bad will happen in this country,\u201d El Hindawi told me, \u201cand as a Syrian refugee I\u2019ll be in trouble.\u201d</p> <h2>Seeking the Canadian Dream</h2> <p>My father, Ahmed Mouallem, emigrated from Lebanon in 1970, when it was on the cusp of a civil war that killed 4% of the country\u2019s population and displaced another quarter. He was 16, but by the time he could legally vote he didn\u2019t have to think about who he\u2019d cast his ballot for: Pierre Elliott Trudeau, the man who spritzed multiculturalism into the crisp Canadian air. Though the official policy felt fragile in those rare moments when he was called a \u201cdeport\u201d, or when he overheard complaints of immigrants taking jobs from Canadians, you couldn\u2019t convince Ahmed that Allan had an advantage over him. </p> <p>Or that Ahmed had an advantage over Aboriginals. \u201cIn Canada,\u201d my father would tell me, \u201cif you work hard you will succeed.\u201d The lesson, as I interpreted it, was that labour and location were the critical factors; success had nothing to do with race, religion or anything else.</p> <p>In August 2016, I asked my father to translate during an interview with Mohammed El Hindawi. As I drove from my parents\u2019 spacious modern home on Edmonton\u2019s north side to an aged pink row-house deep on the south side, I asked Ahmed, a businessman without a high school degree who\u2019d retired at 49 if he thought Syrian refugees would have the same shot at success that he had. He said that they have it even easier with so much government support; that kind of direct support didn\u2019t exist in the early 70s. </p> <p>I recast my question to be generally about Muslim immigrants. \u201cMaybe in the States they\u2019d have problems, because of 9/11 and so many other things where the Muslim was involved. But right here, no,\u201d he said. \u201cI never worry because I have the best neighbours. We respect each other and always say hi, even the Vietnamese guy. So if you just walk straight, ignore what\u2019s around you, work hard, you don\u2019t have to worry about nothing. Just look at your future in the right way, and you\u2019ll be OK.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s one the most Canadian things you can own. It keeps away the bad dreams.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>His faith in Canada was, and is, unshakable. I parked and we stepped out of the car, but 10 metres from Mohammed El Hindawi\u2019s front door, I began to fear that he had texted me the wrong address. A dreamcatcher was floating in the entryway of the town-home. I turned to my translator, concerned, but then we heard Arabic music wafting out an open window. Before I knocked, El Hindawi greeted us with his middle son, Wael, a short kid with chubby arms who reminded me of myself at 12. El Hindawi, a 39-year-old with stubble on his chin and who dressed youthfully in an untucked pink polo, looked nothing like my dad, a man who\u2019d been wearing dark dress shirts tucked into pleated pants for the 31 years I\u2019d known him.</p> <p>I asked El Hindawi about the dreamcatcher. He said he\u2019d found it at the Value Village. \u201cDo you know what it is?\u201d I said.</p> <p>A concerned look overcame Wael. \u201c<em>Haram</em>?\u201d he asked. Sinful. It was one of the two hundred or so Arabic words I knew.</p> <p>\u201cNo <em>haram</em>,\u201d I said. \u201cThis is from the original people of Canada. It\u2019s one the most Canadian things you can own. It keeps away the bad dreams.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood,\u201d said El Hindawi, whose English had greatly improved in the last 11 months. He told me that he\u2019d just returned from a weeklong trip camping to Sylvan Lake, a couple hours south of Edmonton. They drove there as a family, and it wasn\u2019t even their first camping trip that summer.</p> <p>He and his wife Nisreene, who was upstairs tending to their 18-month-old daughter, had spare time on their hands now that the children were back in school. Mohammed was still unemployed, and frustratingly so since he\u2019d worked so hard to learn English, but otherwise he was noticeably more relaxed than when I\u2019d first met him. The bedbugs were gone. The children safe and integrating. He felt more confident speaking up for himself. The newspaper article about his family\u2019s dilemma didn\u2019t just inflame the internet\u2019s fringe right, but it also sparked rumours in his largely ethnic neighbourhood. He said there was word going around that social services were going to take away his children. \u201cBut the last five, six months, better,\u201d he said, smiling.</p> <p>They welcomed us into their living room. His neighbour Sharef Sharf, was sitting on the couch. Like El Hindawi, Sharf had arrived from Syria via Lebanon, but he\u2019d arrived post-election, after Canada had decided, with a resounding \u201cyes\u201d, to accept more refugees. Perhaps it was the relief of having brought his wife and three small children to safety, or maybe it was arriving in a rebranded tolerant Canada on one of the first planeloads of 25,000 promised refugees, but Sharf seemed to almost glow from the inside out. While Wael doted on us with an overflowing pot of sweetened Turkish tea, Sharf used a big smile and a patchwork of English and Arabic to weave the story of his escape from Syria.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cb802e7e4682eb24ec9978278b4ee609f15b5974\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb802e7e4682eb24ec9978278b4ee609f15b5974/0_0_2463_3764/654.png\" alt=\"\u2018It is life or death.

I am life after death.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cooper &amp; O'Hara</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sharf lived in a village near Daraa, the spark that lit the Syrian civil war in 2011 when a group of boys aged 10 to 15 inspired by the Arab Spring spray-painted \u201cthe people want to topple the regime\u201d on a wall in plain view. The boys were arrested, interrogated, tortured and, they believed, prepared for execution. Massive protests saved their lives. Sharf, who ran a construction company in Daraa, was hesitant to get involved in the uprising, given that the military violently and fatally suppressed opposition. The burgeoning checkpoints worried him, as did the rebel commanders who overtook those checkpoints, but, he said, as long as he could feed his children he had no reason to leave.</p> <p>Then, on the seventh day of Ramadan in 2012, a missile landed directly outside the family\u2019s home as they were about to break fast. His six-year-old daughter was hurled out a two-storey window by the impact. Outside, he scooped her up, a leg dangling backwards over his arm. With his family in tow, he carried her five kilometres to a hospital, where doctors wrapped sticks around her legs and sent them away. The next time he saw their home was in a picture, months later, after they had fled to Lebanon. \u201cIt was like gravel,\u201d he told me.</p> <p>Here was a middle-class man whose entire life was uprooted in an instant. I couldn\u2019t fathom abandoning everything you owned, almost everyone you knew, at a moment\u2019s notice. I asked him how difficult that decision must have been, but he didn\u2019t understand the question. I turned to my father to translate my question into Arabic, but he interjected. \u201cIt was not a hard decision,\u201d my translator assured me, who until this moment was doing his job without apparent editorialization. \u201cTrust me.\u201d</p> <p>I insisted he ask Sharf the question. He complied.</p> <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t even a choice,\u201d said Sharf. \u201cIt is life or death. I am life after death.\u201d</p> <p>Sharf did not share El Hindawi\u2019s worry about Canadians turning on him and people like him. It seemed implausible given the welcoming he received in Canada in January 2016. \u201cThis is my sponsorship family,\u201d he said, handing me his phone to look at a picture of 20 people posing with his wife and children at the Edmonton international airport, most of them Chinese Canadians from a Mandarin church, as well as people of European and Indo-Asian backgrounds. Sharf lurched forward and flicked the screen. There was Justin Trudeau, with his arm around Sharf and his son. When his children grow up, Sharf said, he\u2019ll tell them that they can become doctors because of the prime minister. \u201cJustin Trudeau is our hero. A hero to my little boy.\u201d As for Canada\u2019s last prime minister, all Sharf understood about him was: \u201cHe made us wait two years.\u201d</p> <h2>Canada won\u2019t raise its Syrian refugee quota </h2> <p>After the election of the Trudeau Liberals, Canada swiftly rebranded itself as a tolerant and open-armed society. Within months of the parliamentary exchange of power, the foreign press gushed over the nation\u2019s treatment of refugees in stark contrast to most of the rest of the western world. Canada has accepted a relatively small number of Syria\u2019s 6 million refugees, but the Trudeau government continues to hail its comparatively small effort; within hours of Trump\u2019s recent indefinite ban on Syrian refugees and four-month ban on all others, Trudeau tweeted a photo of himself hugging a Syrian boy at an airport, the visual message being that Canada was there to help.</p> <p>They would not, however, raise Canada\u2019s refugee quota \u2013 or scrap a policy that blocks US migrants from seeking asylum up north, forcing some asylum seekers to literally lose digits and limbs to frostbite as they sneak across our open borders. Still, for many of the migrants who\u2019ve already arrived, the reputation is warranted. \u201cSomething I like very much here in Canada is they call us newcomers, not refugees,\u201d said Daroo Karajoul, a cosmopolitan Kurdish Syrian with a gem ear piercing.</p> <p>I met Karajoul at a central Edmonton Lebanese restaurant for hookah and shish kebab. Two other Syrian men, Basel Abou Hammrah and Morhaf Aldiri, joined us. Speaking demographically, the men I sat with ticked the boxes of the crude caricatures people create to represent the problems immigration brings. They are single men in their mid-20s. Two of them are Muslim. All arrived thanks to the Liberals\u2019 resettlement campaign that their Conservative opponents warned could allow for contamination by extremists. Yet they have found few, if any, indications that they are not welcome here. If anything, Canadians can be overly accommodating, said Karajoul, noting a visiting neighbour who worried she had offended him with her exposed shoulders.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>'Nobody saw us as a human,' he said. 'Just as an economic problem. It was very racist.'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cHere, they treat us as human,\u201d said Abou Hammrah, a clean-shaven Arab Christian. \u201cThey encourage you to do things with your life.\u201d Abou Hammrah, an accountant who moved to Edmonton with his mother and siblings (his father died of stress-related causes during the war), told me his experiences in Canada are starkly different from those in Lebanon, where they slept five to a tent and were interrogated at checkpoints outside the camp.</p> <p>Aldiri, a student of French literature, echoed the treatment among his fellow Sunni Muslims in Jordan: \u201cThe camp was like a zoo in the middle of the desert. You can\u2019t leave and there\u2019s police around you everywhere.\u201d When his family moved into an apartment in the capital Amman, they later learned that they were renting it at 10 times the cost as their neighbours. Any complaints were met with: If you don\u2019t like it here, go back! \u201cNobody saw us as a human,\u201d he said. \u201cJust as an economic problem. It was very racist.\u201d</p> <p>The treatment of his family and fellow Syrians wasn\u2019t racist in the literal sense. Aldiri and his discriminators were of the same race, and likely the same religion, sharing more or less the same basic customs and speaking the same language. But they were stripped of their humanity and whittled down to undesirable objects. Subjected to everything that we\u2019ve come to understand as racism. But it does beg the question: What, precisely, is racism? And how is it expressed in places typically known for being tolerant? Places like Canada.</p> <h2>Canada\u2019s own \u2018democratic racism\u2019</h2> <p>Canada\u2019s particular brand of prejudice might be called \u201cdemocratic racism\u201d, which is essentially how the sociologist Frances Henry characterized multiculturalism as a tool to rationalize racial disadvantages and keep \u201cwhite dominance\u201d intact. Other sociologists have dubbed Canada\u2019s attitudes towards the other as \u201cpolite racism\u201d. Whatever we call the prejudice that flows under, and sometimes on, the surface of our society, it might be epitomized by the living conditions of indigenous people living in Canada, who have suffered \u201cmore hardship than the African American population in the US\u201d, according to data analyzed by Maclean\u2019s in 2015. Taking into account factors such as life expectancy, high school drop-out rates and median income, the descendants of slaves in racially charged America are living better lives than our First Peoples.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b0816bca727cdd84e9d751962d647813a0691ba9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0816bca727cdd84e9d751962d647813a0691ba9/0_0_3500_2334/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Something I like very much here in Canada is they call us newcomers, not refugees.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Something I like very much here in Canada is they call us newcomers, not refugees.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lyle Stafford/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even as racism has been largely written out of Canadian law \u2013 ending the \u201cHead Tax\u201d on Chinese immigrants, closing Japanese internment camps and shuttering the last residential school in 1996 (though the Indian Act remains in good standing) \u2013 racism is given air in Canada through the right to hold and disseminate racist opinions. </p> <p>Many of Canada\u2019s current hate speech laws were formed in the 1970s to combat a surge of antisemitic incidents, but in 2014, a crucial law, section 13 of the Human Rights Code, a special provision for hate speech online, was repealed. (Curiously, the next year, government passed bill C-52 to crack down on online recruitment and propaganda by Islamic terrorists.) But in the noble pursuit of protecting free speech, lifting the internet clause has created a safe place for outlets such as Rebel Media, which has over half a million YouTube subscribers.</p> <p>It may have also helped<strong> </strong>take the shackles off sites like Stormfront Canada, a popular white supremacy forum from the internet\u2019s halcyon days, whose users are \u201cdisproportionately responsible for some of the most lethal hate crimes and mass killings\u201d since 1995 (over one hundred murders between 2009 and 2014 alone), according to the US-based Southern Poverty Law Centre.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>When you start digging at the surface, we\u2019re not very accepting.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Stormfront members and online spreaders of hate speech once hid behind screen names, but now Facebook commentators more often use links that identify them (all part of the ongoing validation of the views they represent). Irfan Chaudhry, a former criminologist and now a University of Alberta PhD candidate who researches racism online, says the unveiled nature of Facebook especially gives him access to real people using real names and real faces. He admits that data gathered from social media is imperfect and anecdotal, but it remains the most open pathway to gaining insight into Canadians\u2019 sentiments on minorities. </p> <p>\u201cThe sentiment\u2019s always existed, but it\u2019s just now more visible,\u201d he told me in the days leading up to the US election. \u201cThe reality chips away at what some envision as Canada\u2019s greatest strength \u2013 multiculturalism and the acceptance of others. When you start digging at the surface, we\u2019re not very accepting.\u201d</p> <p>Karajoul accepts prejudice as a fact of life because, as a minority Kurd, he\u2019s been on the receiving end of it everywhere he\u2019s lived \u2013 Syria, Turkey and even Canada, where a man on Tinder rejected him with the message: \u201cWhite is right.\u201d It was no big deal. He always dreamed of a place where there are \u201cno borders\u201d. And Canada, to him, is the closest thing to it. \u201cIt\u2019s like a garden of people. All these different flowers and smells.\u201d</p> <p>But snakes slither in this garden. Certainly, the white nationalist movement could infiltrate the government, as it seems to have in America. There are also Islamic extremists who could reverse popular opinion, as they have in Germany, where the doors were thrown wide open early on but where there has now been a backlash. There have been protests of significant size, namely those staged by the Dresden nationalist group Pegida (\u201cPatriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West\u201d). The Soldiers of Odin, a white nationalist vigilante group founded in Finland less than two years ago, now has chapters in every major Canadian city, where they\u2019re known to whitewash their intimidation campaigns by volunteering at homeless shelters or shovelling elderly people\u2019s driveways. Polite racism indeed.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Polite racism indeed.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>My request to interview a member of Soldiers of Odin was denied by the Edmonton president, but I was able to speak with Jenny Hill (a pseudonym), the president of Pegida Canada. She immediately recoiled at my use of the word Islamophobia to describe the sentiment of her group. \u201cThe term is a non-word,\u201d she told me over the phone. \u201cI guess you could say we fear Islam. I fear Sharia law coming into Canada. In that case, you could say I am Islamophobic.\u201d</p> <p>As an outspoken critic, Hill fears violent backlash. Pegida\u2019s small Toronto rallies have been outnumbered by counter-protesters from the anti-fascist group Antifa, who\u2019ve called them \u201cNazi scum\u201d. On one occasion, police stopped their protest, concerned it would escalate to violence. Hill doesn\u2019t doubt that her group has attracted some neo-Nazis, and said she goes through great efforts to remove racist comments when they appear. (A cursory scroll shows either that \u201cracist comments\u201d is a relative term or Hill is having trouble keeping up with her workload.) </p> <p>Ironically, she was less fearful of Muslims than extreme leftists. She\u2019s never had a negative encounter with a Muslim person, she admitted. \u201cWe are concerned about the ideology. The amount of Muslims that are killed by other Muslims because of a difference in doctrine or how they follow the Qur\u2019an is huge and horrible. We think they\u2019re victims of their ideology.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018The truth is that 9/11 happened and not much changed in our immediate world\u2019</h2> <p>Throughout my childhood and adolescence, I didn\u2019t so much try to reconcile my dual heritage as deny it. It was humiliating to hear my parents speak Arabic in public, and, to this day, I speak a fraction of the Arabic my siblings can. I avoided most of my parents\u2019 food, rejected their dances, resented their chauvinism. Growing up in a small town in the conservative heartland, it seemed as a family \u2013 these funny-sounding Muslim pita-eaters \u2013 that we went through great efforts to other ourselves. </p> <p>We held a relatively fine standing in the world, however, something I understood from the earliest jokes I learned on the schoolyard, like, \u201cWhat do you call three Indians in a ditch?\u201d (A sleepover.) Behind our closed doors, there was distrust of all the others \u2013 whites, Natives, smaller Muslims sects, and especially Jews, though I didn\u2019t actually meet one until high school \u2013 but outside our household doors my family wished to be accepted as honorary whites. And we were, even to the point of being embraced as such in our community.</p> <p>And this is where a reader could reasonably expect me to write: \u201cAnd then 9/11 happened.\u201d But the truth is that 9/11 happened and not much changed in our immediate world. Yes, there were more people suddenly interested in my background and a few wisecracks (Omar bin Laden) that I laughed off. But we lost neither friends nor customers at our family restaurant, which was busier than ever thanks to an oil boom. The bigger change was within myself. Even if I didn\u2019t feel like I was being treated suspiciously, I internalized the fear of radical Islam, and exercised any faith left inside me by joining a \u201cskeptics\u201d group and antagonizing street-preachers whenever time allowed it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The bigger change was within myself \u2026 I internalized the fear of radical Islam</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Some of the authors I was reading at the time (Sam Harris, Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens) cautioned against all supernatural beliefs, and all religions, but when it came to Islam the message tended to be more heavy-handed. Many writers and thinkers I came across felt the Qur\u2019an espoused misogyny, bloodlust and global domination, that Muslim immigrants are populating Europe so quickly and birthing so many babies, that by the end of the 21st century it will be a Muslim majority continent, or that Islam promotes a culture of conquest and its followers wish to impose Sharia law (the first I\u2019d heard of it). </p> <p>Most worrying of all was that these writers believed Islam was \u201cincompatible\u201d with western values. In a sense, they feared Islam would conquer the west just as Christians did, systematically purging non-believers through genocide and indoctrination. The way Pegida\u2019s Jenny Hill, an ardent Christian, felt about a religious takeover surely echoed what Indigenous peoples felt as they watched their practices and visibility erased from the landscape. Hill, after some consideration, agreed that it wasn\u2019t so different. \u201cI don\u2019t want that oppression to happen again.\u201d</p> <p>She doesn\u2019t appear to have much to worry about. The best demographic science suggests Europe\u2019s Muslim population will peak at 10% and America\u2019s at 2%, according to <a href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/myth-muslim-tide-fortress-europe\">The Myth of the Muslim Tide</a> by journalist Doug Saunders. Children of Muslim immigrants do not have as many children as their parents and they secularize at rates roughly equal to that of immigrants of other minority religions. Still, as Trump demonstrates daily, facts are simply quaint artefacts of a bygone era.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>There is no propaganda machine more effective than fear-mongering around Islamic extremism.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Today, there is no propaganda machine more effective than fear-mongering around Islamic extremism. With Isis\u2019s barbarism and attacks on the west ratcheting up the hysteria, Islamophobia has gone mainstream. Would-be Alberta premier and former immigration minister Jason Kenney tweets bogus images of religious enslavement. The National Post covers a dubious self-published study alleging extremist views in average mosques. Conservative MP and leadership candidate Kellie Leitch \u2013 whose selling point to the base is a \u201cnon-Canadian values test\u201d for new immigrants (a clear dog-whistle about Sharia-hysteria) \u2013 defends the Trump administration\u2019s right to register Muslims, ban immigration from Muslims nations and concentrate their counter-extremism efforts exclusively on Islam.</p> <p>When our political and media figures adopt or endorse xenophobia, it gives social licence to the harboured racism of the segment of the general public that once kept such views under wraps. I began to see this clearly in the lead-up to Canada\u2019s 2015 federal election (and it hasn\u2019t subsided). A balloon artist busking in downtown Edmonton, upon learning my name, joked that he\u2019d create a \u201cterrorist\u201d for me (whatever that would look like). On Twitter, I\u2019m blocking users spamming me with anti-Muslim or anti-Arab epithets like Whack-a-Mole. In full view on Facebook, friends touted \u201cCanadian values\u201d and decried settling refugees over helping \u201cour own\u201d.</p> <p>A childhood friend recently posted a graphic video of a young straight couple being stoned to death by Isis, supposedly because of their inter-religious relationship, adding a rant against letting any more of \u201cthese people\u201d through our borders. Did it not occur to her that \u201cthese people\u201d could have been the murdered lovers, not the stone throwers? That they were just newer versions of the Mouallems and Mourads (my mother\u2019s maiden name), who also left a war-torn country to build a better life. </p> <p>If you want to know what Syrian refugees want from our country, there are now 40,000 of them you can ask. \u201cMy dream,\u201d Mohammed El Hindawi told me, \u201cis that my kids will be doctors so one day they can go to Syria and look after the people and tell them about the life they found in Canada.\u201d But even though Canadians elected Trudeau\u2019s refugee-friendly government, repeated polls show we are almost evenly split on whether to take them in. And there is ample evidence to be found, without having to spend much time looking, that our welcoming attitude sits in fragile balance.</p> <h2>Parallels between 20th-century antisemitism and 21st-century Islamophobia</h2> <p>Because of the rise in women in headscarves who are being assaulted, and harassed, an increasing number of self-defence courses for Muslim women are being offered across Canada. I observed one, last fall, where 50 Muslim women in loose-fitting clothes gathered in an Edmonton school gymnasium. </p> <p>This course was organized by Alberta Muslim Public Affairs Council (Ampac), which also created an \u201cIslamophobia hotline\u201d. Ampac was launched after the Harper government proposed a ban on taking citizenship oaths under a niqab or burka. \u201cThat\u2019s when things started changing,\u201d Nakita Valerio, who sits on the council, told me during the self-defence course. \u201cPeople I know started talking to me about how Islam is not like other religions, repeating things about the hyper-sexualization of our men, a lot of talk about the hijab. I feel like I\u2019m under the microscope more.\u201d</p> <p>She had never expected this moment to come to Canada. Europe, where her family is from, yes, but not here. Six years ago, while in Florence, without any provocation whatsoever, a man grabbed Valerio by her head-scarf and whipped her into traffic while yelling at her to go home. Had he managed to tear off her headscarf, and not just chunks of hair, he would perhaps have seen that the Italian Canadian Muslim convert looked no different from his daughter. It was Valerio\u2019s first week wearing the hijab, and since moving back to her birthplace, Canada, Valerio has committed herself to countering Islamophobia. </p> <p>Last December, when a senior citizen was captured on video taunting hijabis at an Edmonton train station with a noose while singing O, Canada, Valerio and a friend returned to the scene of the crime to distribute flowers to women in headscarves for a day. The day after the Quebec City mosque shooting, she co-organized a vigil with close to 3,000 attendees braving the frigid Edmonton weather. The outpouring of support heartens her, but Valerio has a less-than-optimistic forecast for Muslims. \u201cI worry that people will get lost and burnt out, and as a result lessen their ability to take action. A similar set of circumstances happened before the second world war.\u201d Valerio, who is a student of Jewish Holocaust studies, added: \u201cAs a veiled woman, I say, with no disrespect to the Holocaust, that we are today\u2019s Jews.\u201d</p> <p>The comparison is jarring, but clear parallels between 20th-century antisemitism and 21st-century Islamophobia are emerging. The uncapturably sickening treatment of Jews, not just in the last century, but throughout so many historical periods, is a pattern that appears to be finding a new modern expression. Frances Henry, a Jewish refugee of Hitler\u2019s Germany, and co-author of The Colour of Democracy: Racism in Canadian Society, recognizes the rhetoric coming from rightwing populism. \u201cWhat are we to make of it,\u201d she writes, \u201cother than there is a new scapegoat?\u201d</p> <p>Isis has, of course, simply carried the fear of the other to its logical conclusion, an all-out global war, and is appealing to the disenfranchised abroad using the same online tools as white supremacists. The more intolerant the west becomes, the easier their job. With every Islamophobic event another alienated Muslim is radicalized. With every terrorist attack, another alienated non-Muslim is radicalized.</p> <h2>\u2018Our goals are just to survive.\u2019</h2> <p>Despite the various xenophobic undercurrents flowing through their new home, Mohammed El Hindawi and Sharef Sharf have nevertheless fully embraced the values of multiculturalism. Not that they are naive about the precariousness of tolerance. Worried that another attack perpetrated by Muslim extremists will compromise his living conditions, El Hindawi told me, \u201cIf I find out that one of my neighbours is doing these things, I will take them to the police myself.\u201d</p> <p>By the end of our evening together, my father had all but given up on translating, and it became three men fervently debating in Arabic about Canadian cultural differences and the futility of Middle Eastern politics. It felt like a scene from my childhood, sitting quietly in living rooms, with abundant fruit, tea and sweets spread across a coffee table, being entertained by the impassioned discussions of adults. </p> <p>I overheard, in my limited Arabic, my father ask if they worried that their religion and culture would be seduced away from his children. Sharf said he wasn\u2019t the slightest concerned, and he and my father debated over the importance of retaining their culture. \u201cDon\u2019t you want your kids to stay Muslim, marry a Muslim, and not say, \u2018Get away from me\u2019 to the parents?\u201d my dad asked, apparently unconcerned that Exhibit A in this argument, his son, was beside him.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d said Sharf, shaking his head. \u201cWe will just do what we can do.\u201d</p> <p>I interjected, and asked Sharf what he wanted from his new life. He paused, appearing suddenly emotional and silent, and thought about it with a blissful smile. \u201cDon\u2019t start singing now,\u201d my dad joked, anticipating the man might break out in song.</p> <p>Sharf laughed. \u201cOur goals are just to survive.\u201d He looked at each of us in turn. \u201cThese are not big goals.\u201d</p> <p><em>Looking for more great work from </em><em><a href=\"http://eighteenbridges.com/\">Eighteen Bridges</a>, the magazine of narrative journalism from Alberta, Canada?

          "bodyText": "It was never particularly complicated. All Mohammad El Hindawi wanted for his family was a reprieve from the bedbugs afflicting his children. In the summer of 2015, while dealing with the vermin in their new home of Edmonton, he\u2019d learned through a social worker that Canadians apparently loved camping, and so, as a new Canadian, he thought that perhaps this was something he should try. Camping was a new concept to this refugee born and raised in Hama, Syria, site of the Hama massacre of 1982, when the military rounded up 10,000 or 20,000 or 40,000 people for execution (nobody really knows). His father and uncles were spared, but El Hindawi, who was six then, never shed the trauma and bitterness. His whole life has been a struggle, from his early 20s when he lost his firstborn son to measles, right up until 13 November 2014, the day he boarded a plane and flew to Canada \u2013 a country he\u2019d never learned about in public school. His life remained a struggle, because he had six kids crying every night, a wife telling him they\u2019d be better off on the streets, and a family panicking over a blood-sucking insect they\u2019d never encountered before. So, yes, camping, whatever camping was, sounded like a great idea. I met El Hindawi on the first sub-zero day of the fall of 2015, at a workshop at Edmonton\u2019s Catholic Social Services, sponsored by the government of Canada, to teach new Canadians about the ancient western art of roughing it in the woods. Along with his wife and kids, he was there to learn, and I was there as a reporter to tell a warm story about immigrants. The 43rd Canadian federal election was a month away and it seemed, at least in the moment, that more than global warming, healthcare, trade, taxes and pipelines, the most important issue to Canadians was Canadian-ness itself, and whether someone like El Hindawi, or his hijab-wearing wife, Nisreene, had and/or deserved the right to call themselves Canadian. This debate, however, was all but invisible to the country\u2019s new residents, who could hardly speak their new language, let alone read the news. If there was time between English school, job-hunting, and caring for an infant, three small children and two teens \u2013 all while relying upon a confusing public transit system \u2013 then that time was spent following the tragic unravelling of their homeland, not the comparatively minor issue of an election they couldn\u2019t vote in. El Hindawi, a middle-class petroleum mechanic in Hama, was involved in anti-government activism for much of their last decade in Syria (against the wishes of Nisreene, who feared for their family). In 2011, when the rebellion began, he gave his vacant rental property to a group of rogue medical professionals who treated injured protesters. He believes a recaptured survivor was the one who ratted on him in March 2012, forcing El Hindawi to flee to Lebanon in a taxi with a friend\u2019s ID. The driver returned two weeks later with the rest of the family, who paid border guards $200 to open the gate. They lived in an apartment with sporadic water supply, surviving off a paltry United Nations allowance and the charity of a friend abroad and some Lebanese, though they found many of their new neighbours to be unwelcoming of refugees. It took 18 months for the UN to resettle them. On a Wednesday morning, he got the call. They were going to Canada \u2013 the next day. \u201cSure, I\u2019ll go to Canada, even though I don\u2019t know what it is or where it is,\u201d Mohammed would later tell me through a translator. \u201cGood \u2013 I just want to bring my family to survive, and God knows what\u2019s Canada.\u201d First impressions: Canada is cold, which he assumed when he was given a winter coat on arrival, but didn\u2019t fully comprehend until the frost hit his cheeks outside Edmonton international airport. Canada is also expensive; by spring their savings of $9,400 were gone. But Canada is caring, too. An Arab business-owner hired El Hindawi on a construction site, though language difficulties and arthritis meant he was unable to keep the job. Insomnia didn\u2019t help either, but a doctor diagnosed him with depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, and he\u2019s now receiving treatment for it. They were heartened by the generosity of Edmonton\u2019s Capital Region Housing Corporation, which sheltered the large family at a subsidized rate of just $550 a month. But then came the infestation. Bedbugs. It made it even harder to sleep at night. It made the children miserable. It caused a rift between the parents. Before leaving the camping workshop, El Hindawi showed me pictures of the red pocks on the back of his newborn \u2013 the first second generation Canadian for these first generation parents \u2013 and asked me to help. It seemed like a worthwhile human interest story for my newspaper, so I took his phone number to pass on to my editor. A week later, another reporter came to his home to write about their living conditions, which turned out to be quite complicated. \u2018I\u2019ve never cried in public, but when I read them I cried\u2019 Numerous health inspectors who\u2019d come to their duplex had deemed it safe. The landlord had sprayed repeatedly for vermin and the El Hindawis had purged the space of any possibly infested object (meaning yet another loss of worldly possessions). Still, the pocks returned. There were few affordable housing options for the family of eight, the most recent inspection found no evidence of bedbugs and the landlord had been taking the complaints seriously. When the facts were laid out in the story and published on the cover of Metro News, an army of online commentators turned El Hindawi\u2019s family into ammunition for their anti-immigrant campaign. \u201cIngrates\u201d, \u201cqueue-jumpers\u201d and \u201cGO HOME!!!\u201d were typical comments. \u201cHow about you go out and get a job Mohammed?\u201d read another. The newspaper deleted and closed the comments section, but not before El Hindawi himself had them read to him. The malice was aggregated and proliferated by alt-right media sites such as The Rebel, owned by Alberta\u2019s infamous and Islamophobic pundit Ezra Levant. The case of the ungrateful and troublesome El Hindawis was used by such sites as clear evidence that Canada needed to keep refugees out. There were sympathetic readers, some of whom called the newspaper to help, but the harsh words still came as a shock to El Hindawi. \u201cI\u2019ve never cried in public, but when I read them I cried,\u201d he said. \u201cI lost my father and my son, but I never cried like that. They hurt me so badly. Their words just touched my soul.\u201d This was not the fair and tolerant Canada the settlement agents told him he was bringing his family to. But it is his Canada, our Canada, a democracy founded on and propagated through various undemocratic practices\u2013 cultural genocide, papal bulls, bad-faith treaties \u2013 always with the white euro-Christian norm at the centre of the effort to safeguard itself from \u201cthe other\u201d, whoever that might be. Ancient Greeks called the others they encountered \u201cbarbarians\u201d. Islamic crusaders then (and now, in the form of Isis) called them \u201cinfidels\u201d. In the US and Canada, we have many words but generally adhere to the politest one: immigrants. Though the majority of Canadians welcome this \u201cother\u201d, defend this other and identify with this other (because to be a land of one we must be a land of others), they might still distrust this other. And currently, no other in this country is distrusted more than the one who looks like an El Hindawi. An Angus Reid survey of national attitudes toward religions showed more Canadians have negative than neutral views of Muslims, and it is a big gap down to the next religion on the list. Prejudice against Islam is highest in Quebec, where two-thirds admit to it, and where six Muslim men were gunned down in the middle of prayer last January by a white nationalist who cultivated a pro-Trump fanaticism online. The massacre happened the weekend Donald Trump signed an executive order enacting a legal version of his promised \u201cMuslim Ban\u201d, motivated by fears of an Islamic takeover \u201clike Europe\u201d, said the shooter. But such a tragedy was probably inevitable, Trump or no. Though hate crimes in general are declining, they are not declining against Canada\u2019s one million Muslims. In fact, they have more than doubled between 2012 and 2014. These are numbers reported before Trump, before Brexit, before the Burka Ban and Barbaric Cultural Practises hotline. Before Nice and San Bernadino. Before Orlando and Berlin. \u201cSomeday something bad will happen in this country,\u201d El Hindawi told me, \u201cand as a Syrian refugee I\u2019ll be in trouble.\u201d Seeking the Canadian Dream My father, Ahmed Mouallem, emigrated from Lebanon in 1970, when it was on the cusp of a civil war that killed 4% of the country\u2019s population and displaced another quarter. He was 16, but by the time he could legally vote he didn\u2019t have to think about who he\u2019d cast his ballot for: Pierre Elliott Trudeau, the man who spritzed multiculturalism into the crisp Canadian air. Though the official policy felt fragile in those rare moments when he was called a \u201cdeport\u201d, or when he overheard complaints of immigrants taking jobs from Canadians, you couldn\u2019t convince Ahmed that Allan had an advantage over him. Or that Ahmed had an advantage over Aboriginals. \u201cIn Canada,\u201d my father would tell me, \u201cif you work hard you will succeed.\u201d The lesson, as I interpreted it, was that labour and location were the critical factors; success had nothing to do with race, religion or anything else. In August 2016, I asked my father to translate during an interview with Mohammed El Hindawi. As I drove from my parents\u2019 spacious modern home on Edmonton\u2019s north side to an aged pink row-house deep on the south side, I asked Ahmed, a businessman without a high school degree who\u2019d retired at 49 if he thought Syrian refugees would have the same shot at success that he had. He said that they have it even easier with so much government support; that kind of direct support didn\u2019t exist in the early 70s. I recast my question to be generally about Muslim immigrants. \u201cMaybe in the States they\u2019d have problems, because of 9/11 and so many other things where the Muslim was involved. But right here, no,\u201d he said. \u201cI never worry because I have the best neighbours. We respect each other and always say hi, even the Vietnamese guy. So if you just walk straight, ignore what\u2019s around you, work hard, you don\u2019t have to worry about nothing. Just look at your future in the right way, and you\u2019ll be OK.\u201d His faith in Canada was, and is, unshakable. I parked and we stepped out of the car, but 10 metres from Mohammed El Hindawi\u2019s front door, I began to fear that he had texted me the wrong address. A dreamcatcher was floating in the entryway of the town-home. I turned to my translator, concerned, but then we heard Arabic music wafting out an open window. Before I knocked, El Hindawi greeted us with his middle son, Wael, a short kid with chubby arms who reminded me of myself at 12. El Hindawi, a 39-year-old with stubble on his chin and who dressed youthfully in an untucked pink polo, looked nothing like my dad, a man who\u2019d been wearing dark dress shirts tucked into pleated pants for the 31 years I\u2019d known him. I asked El Hindawi about the dreamcatcher. He said he\u2019d found it at the Value Village. \u201cDo you know what it is?\u201d I said. A concerned look overcame Wael. \u201cHaram?\u201d he asked. Sinful. It was one of the two hundred or so Arabic words I knew. \u201cNo haram,\u201d I said. \u201cThis is from the original people of Canada. It\u2019s one the most Canadian things you can own. It keeps away the bad dreams.\u201d \u201cGood,\u201d said El Hindawi, whose English had greatly improved in the last 11 months. He told me that he\u2019d just returned from a weeklong trip camping to Sylvan Lake, a couple hours south of Edmonton. They drove there as a family, and it wasn\u2019t even their first camping trip that summer. He and his wife Nisreene, who was upstairs tending to their 18-month-old daughter, had spare time on their hands now that the children were back in school. Mohammed was still unemployed, and frustratingly so since he\u2019d worked so hard to learn English, but otherwise he was noticeably more relaxed than when I\u2019d first met him. The bedbugs were gone. The children safe and integrating. He felt more confident speaking up for himself. The newspaper article about his family\u2019s dilemma didn\u2019t just inflame the internet\u2019s fringe right, but it also sparked rumours in his largely ethnic neighbourhood. He said there was word going around that social services were going to take away his children. \u201cBut the last five, six months, better,\u201d he said, smiling. They welcomed us into their living room. His neighbour Sharef Sharf, was sitting on the couch. Like El Hindawi, Sharf had arrived from Syria via Lebanon, but he\u2019d arrived post-election, after Canada had decided, with a resounding \u201cyes\u201d, to accept more refugees. Perhaps it was the relief of having brought his wife and three small children to safety, or maybe it was arriving in a rebranded tolerant Canada on one of the first planeloads of 25,000 promised refugees, but Sharf seemed to almost glow from the inside out. While Wael doted on us with an overflowing pot of sweetened Turkish tea, Sharf used a big smile and a patchwork of English and Arabic to weave the story of his escape from Syria. Sharf lived in a village near Daraa, the spark that lit the Syrian civil war in 2011 when a group of boys aged 10 to 15 inspired by the Arab Spring spray-painted \u201cthe people want to topple the regime\u201d on a wall in plain view. The boys were arrested, interrogated, tortured and, they believed, prepared for execution. Massive protests saved their lives. Sharf, who ran a construction company in Daraa, was hesitant to get involved in the uprising, given that the military violently and fatally suppressed opposition. The burgeoning checkpoints worried him, as did the rebel commanders who overtook those checkpoints, but, he said, as long as he could feed his children he had no reason to leave. Then, on the seventh day of Ramadan in 2012, a missile landed directly outside the family\u2019s home as they were about to break fast. His six-year-old daughter was hurled out a two-storey window by the impact. Outside, he scooped her up, a leg dangling backwards over his arm. With his family in tow, he carried her five kilometres to a hospital, where doctors wrapped sticks around her legs and sent them away. The next time he saw their home was in a picture, months later, after they had fled to Lebanon. \u201cIt was like gravel,\u201d he told me. Here was a middle-class man whose entire life was uprooted in an instant. I couldn\u2019t fathom abandoning everything you owned, almost everyone you knew, at a moment\u2019s notice. I asked him how difficult that decision must have been, but he didn\u2019t understand the question. I turned to my father to translate my question into Arabic, but he interjected. \u201cIt was not a hard decision,\u201d my translator assured me, who until this moment was doing his job without apparent editorialization. \u201cTrust me.\u201d I insisted he ask Sharf the question. He complied. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t even a choice,\u201d said Sharf. \u201cIt is life or death. I am life after death.\u201d Sharf did not share El Hindawi\u2019s worry about Canadians turning on him and people like him. It seemed implausible given the welcoming he received in Canada in January 2016. \u201cThis is my sponsorship family,\u201d he said, handing me his phone to look at a picture of 20 people posing with his wife and children at the Edmonton international airport, most of them Chinese Canadians from a Mandarin church, as well as people of European and Indo-Asian backgrounds. Sharf lurched forward and flicked the screen. There was Justin Trudeau, with his arm around Sharf and his son. When his children grow up, Sharf said, he\u2019ll tell them that they can become doctors because of the prime minister. \u201cJustin Trudeau is our hero. A hero to my little boy.\u201d As for Canada\u2019s last prime minister, all Sharf understood about him was: \u201cHe made us wait two years.\u201d Canada won\u2019t raise its Syrian refugee quota After the election of the Trudeau Liberals, Canada swiftly rebranded itself as a tolerant and open-armed society. Within months of the parliamentary exchange of power, the foreign press gushed over the nation\u2019s treatment of refugees in stark contrast to most of the rest of the western world. Canada has accepted a relatively small number of Syria\u2019s 6 million refugees, but the Trudeau government continues to hail its comparatively small effort; within hours of Trump\u2019s recent indefinite ban on Syrian refugees and four-month ban on all others, Trudeau tweeted a photo of himself hugging a Syrian boy at an airport, the visual message being that Canada was there to help. They would not, however, raise Canada\u2019s refugee quota \u2013 or scrap a policy that blocks US migrants from seeking asylum up north, forcing some asylum seekers to literally lose digits and limbs to frostbite as they sneak across our open borders. Still, for many of the migrants who\u2019ve already arrived, the reputation is warranted. \u201cSomething I like very much here in Canada is they call us newcomers, not refugees,\u201d said Daroo Karajoul, a cosmopolitan Kurdish Syrian with a gem ear piercing. I met Karajoul at a central Edmonton Lebanese restaurant for hookah and shish kebab. Two other Syrian men, Basel Abou Hammrah and Morhaf Aldiri, joined us. Speaking demographically, the men I sat with ticked the boxes of the crude caricatures people create to represent the problems immigration brings. They are single men in their mid-20s. Two of them are Muslim. All arrived thanks to the Liberals\u2019 resettlement campaign that their Conservative opponents warned could allow for contamination by extremists. Yet they have found few, if any, indications that they are not welcome here. If anything, Canadians can be overly accommodating, said Karajoul, noting a visiting neighbour who worried she had offended him with her exposed shoulders. \u201cHere, they treat us as human,\u201d said Abou Hammrah, a clean-shaven Arab Christian. \u201cThey encourage you to do things with your life.\u201d Abou Hammrah, an accountant who moved to Edmonton with his mother and siblings (his father died of stress-related causes during the war), told me his experiences in Canada are starkly different from those in Lebanon, where they slept five to a tent and were interrogated at checkpoints outside the camp. Aldiri, a student of French literature, echoed the treatment among his fellow Sunni Muslims in Jordan: \u201cThe camp was like a zoo in the middle of the desert. You can\u2019t leave and there\u2019s police around you everywhere.\u201d When his family moved into an apartment in the capital Amman, they later learned that they were renting it at 10 times the cost as their neighbours. Any complaints were met with: If you don\u2019t like it here, go back! \u201cNobody saw us as a human,\u201d he said. \u201cJust as an economic problem. It was very racist.\u201d The treatment of his family and fellow Syrians wasn\u2019t racist in the literal sense. Aldiri and his discriminators were of the same race, and likely the same religion, sharing more or less the same basic customs and speaking the same language. But they were stripped of their humanity and whittled down to undesirable objects. Subjected to everything that we\u2019ve come to understand as racism. But it does beg the question: What, precisely, is racism? And how is it expressed in places typically known for being tolerant? Places like Canada. Canada\u2019s own \u2018democratic racism\u2019 Canada\u2019s particular brand of prejudice might be called \u201cdemocratic racism\u201d, which is essentially how the sociologist Frances Henry characterized multiculturalism as a tool to rationalize racial disadvantages and keep \u201cwhite dominance\u201d intact. Other sociologists have dubbed Canada\u2019s attitudes towards the other as \u201cpolite racism\u201d. Whatever we call the prejudice that flows under, and sometimes on, the surface of our society, it might be epitomized by the living conditions of indigenous people living in Canada, who have suffered \u201cmore hardship than the African American population in the US\u201d, according to data analyzed by Maclean\u2019s in 2015. Taking into account factors such as life expectancy, high school drop-out rates and median income, the descendants of slaves in racially charged America are living better lives than our First Peoples. Even as racism has been largely written out of Canadian law \u2013 ending the \u201cHead Tax\u201d on Chinese immigrants, closing Japanese internment camps and shuttering the last residential school in 1996 (though the Indian Act remains in good standing) \u2013 racism is given air in Canada through the right to hold and disseminate racist opinions. Many of Canada\u2019s current hate speech laws were formed in the 1970s to combat a surge of antisemitic incidents, but in 2014, a crucial law, section 13 of the Human Rights Code, a special provision for hate speech online, was repealed. (Curiously, the next year, government passed bill C-52 to crack down on online recruitment and propaganda by Islamic terrorists.) But in the noble pursuit of protecting free speech, lifting the internet clause has created a safe place for outlets such as Rebel Media, which has over half a million YouTube subscribers. It may have also helped take the shackles off sites like Stormfront Canada, a popular white supremacy forum from the internet\u2019s halcyon days, whose users are \u201cdisproportionately responsible for some of the most lethal hate crimes and mass killings\u201d since 1995 (over one hundred murders between 2009 and 2014 alone), according to the US-based Southern Poverty Law Centre. Stormfront members and online spreaders of hate speech once hid behind screen names, but now Facebook commentators more often use links that identify them (all part of the ongoing validation of the views they represent). Irfan Chaudhry, a former criminologist and now a University of Alberta PhD candidate who researches racism online, says the unveiled nature of Facebook especially gives him access to real people using real names and real faces. He admits that data gathered from social media is imperfect and anecdotal, but it remains the most open pathway to gaining insight into Canadians\u2019 sentiments on minorities. \u201cThe sentiment\u2019s always existed, but it\u2019s just now more visible,\u201d he told me in the days leading up to the US election. \u201cThe reality chips away at what some envision as Canada\u2019s greatest strength \u2013 multiculturalism and the acceptance of others. When you start digging at the surface, we\u2019re not very accepting.\u201d Karajoul accepts prejudice as a fact of life because, as a minority Kurd, he\u2019s been on the receiving end of it everywhere he\u2019s lived \u2013 Syria, Turkey and even Canada, where a man on Tinder rejected him with the message: \u201cWhite is right.\u201d It was no big deal. He always dreamed of a place where there are \u201cno borders\u201d. And Canada, to him, is the closest thing to it. \u201cIt\u2019s like a garden of people. All these different flowers and smells.\u201d But snakes slither in this garden. Certainly, the white nationalist movement could infiltrate the government, as it seems to have in America. There are also Islamic extremists who could reverse popular opinion, as they have in Germany, where the doors were thrown wide open early on but where there has now been a backlash. There have been protests of significant size, namely those staged by the Dresden nationalist group Pegida (\u201cPatriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West\u201d). The Soldiers of Odin, a white nationalist vigilante group founded in Finland less than two years ago, now has chapters in every major Canadian city, where they\u2019re known to whitewash their intimidation campaigns by volunteering at homeless shelters or shovelling elderly people\u2019s driveways. Polite racism indeed. My request to interview a member of Soldiers of Odin was denied by the Edmonton president, but I was able to speak with Jenny Hill (a pseudonym), the president of Pegida Canada. She immediately recoiled at my use of the word Islamophobia to describe the sentiment of her group. \u201cThe term is a non-word,\u201d she told me over the phone. \u201cI guess you could say we fear Islam. I fear Sharia law coming into Canada. In that case, you could say I am Islamophobic.\u201d As an outspoken critic, Hill fears violent backlash. Pegida\u2019s small Toronto rallies have been outnumbered by counter-protesters from the anti-fascist group Antifa, who\u2019ve called them \u201cNazi scum\u201d. On one occasion, police stopped their protest, concerned it would escalate to violence. Hill doesn\u2019t doubt that her group has attracted some neo-Nazis, and said she goes through great efforts to remove racist comments when they appear. (A cursory scroll shows either that \u201cracist comments\u201d is a relative term or Hill is having trouble keeping up with her workload.) Ironically, she was less fearful of Muslims than extreme leftists. She\u2019s never had a negative encounter with a Muslim person, she admitted. \u201cWe are concerned about the ideology. The amount of Muslims that are killed by other Muslims because of a difference in doctrine or how they follow the Qur\u2019an is huge and horrible. We think they\u2019re victims of their ideology.\u201d \u2018The truth is that 9/11 happened and not much changed in our immediate world\u2019 Throughout my childhood and adolescence, I didn\u2019t so much try to reconcile my dual heritage as deny it. It was humiliating to hear my parents speak Arabic in public, and, to this day, I speak a fraction of the Arabic my siblings can. I avoided most of my parents\u2019 food, rejected their dances, resented their chauvinism. Growing up in a small town in the conservative heartland, it seemed as a family \u2013 these funny-sounding Muslim pita-eaters \u2013 that we went through great efforts to other ourselves. We held a relatively fine standing in the world, however, something I understood from the earliest jokes I learned on the schoolyard, like, \u201cWhat do you call three Indians in a ditch?\u201d (A sleepover.) Behind our closed doors, there was distrust of all the others \u2013 whites, Natives, smaller Muslims sects, and especially Jews, though I didn\u2019t actually meet one until high school \u2013 but outside our household doors my family wished to be accepted as honorary whites. And we were, even to the point of being embraced as such in our community. And this is where a reader could reasonably expect me to write: \u201cAnd then 9/11 happened.\u201d But the truth is that 9/11 happened and not much changed in our immediate world. Yes, there were more people suddenly interested in my background and a few wisecracks (Omar bin Laden) that I laughed off. But we lost neither friends nor customers at our family restaurant, which was busier than ever thanks to an oil boom. The bigger change was within myself. Even if I didn\u2019t feel like I was being treated suspiciously, I internalized the fear of radical Islam, and exercised any faith left inside me by joining a \u201cskeptics\u201d group and antagonizing street-preachers whenever time allowed it. Some of the authors I was reading at the time (Sam Harris, Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens) cautioned against all supernatural beliefs, and all religions, but when it came to Islam the message tended to be more heavy-handed. Many writers and thinkers I came across felt the Qur\u2019an espoused misogyny, bloodlust and global domination, that Muslim immigrants are populating Europe so quickly and birthing so many babies, that by the end of the 21st century it will be a Muslim majority continent, or that Islam promotes a culture of conquest and its followers wish to impose Sharia law (the first I\u2019d heard of it). Most worrying of all was that these writers believed Islam was \u201cincompatible\u201d with western values. In a sense, they feared Islam would conquer the west just as Christians did, systematically purging non-believers through genocide and indoctrination. The way Pegida\u2019s Jenny Hill, an ardent Christian, felt about a religious takeover surely echoed what Indigenous peoples felt as they watched their practices and visibility erased from the landscape. Hill, after some consideration, agreed that it wasn\u2019t so different. \u201cI don\u2019t want that oppression to happen again.\u201d She doesn\u2019t appear to have much to worry about. The best demographic science suggests Europe\u2019s Muslim population will peak at 10% and America\u2019s at 2%, according to The Myth of the Muslim Tide by journalist Doug Saunders. Children of Muslim immigrants do not have as many children as their parents and they secularize at rates roughly equal to that of immigrants of other minority religions. Still, as Trump demonstrates daily, facts are simply quaint artefacts of a bygone era. Today, there is no propaganda machine more effective than fear-mongering around Islamic extremism. With Isis\u2019s barbarism and attacks on the west ratcheting up the hysteria, Islamophobia has gone mainstream. Would-be Alberta premier and former immigration minister Jason Kenney tweets bogus images of religious enslavement. The National Post covers a dubious self-published study alleging extremist views in average mosques. Conservative MP and leadership candidate Kellie Leitch \u2013 whose selling point to the base is a \u201cnon-Canadian values test\u201d for new immigrants (a clear dog-whistle about Sharia-hysteria) \u2013 defends the Trump administration\u2019s right to register Muslims, ban immigration from Muslims nations and concentrate their counter-extremism efforts exclusively on Islam. When our political and media figures adopt or endorse xenophobia, it gives social licence to the harboured racism of the segment of the general public that once kept such views under wraps. I began to see this clearly in the lead-up to Canada\u2019s 2015 federal election (and it hasn\u2019t subsided). A balloon artist busking in downtown Edmonton, upon learning my name, joked that he\u2019d create a \u201cterrorist\u201d for me (whatever that would look like). On Twitter, I\u2019m blocking users spamming me with anti-Muslim or anti-Arab epithets like Whack-a-Mole. In full view on Facebook, friends touted \u201cCanadian values\u201d and decried settling refugees over helping \u201cour own\u201d. A childhood friend recently posted a graphic video of a young straight couple being stoned to death by Isis, supposedly because of their inter-religious relationship, adding a rant against letting any more of \u201cthese people\u201d through our borders. Did it not occur to her that \u201cthese people\u201d could have been the murdered lovers, not the stone throwers? That they were just newer versions of the Mouallems and Mourads (my mother\u2019s maiden name), who also left a war-torn country to build a better life. If you want to know what Syrian refugees want from our country, there are now 40,000 of them you can ask. \u201cMy dream,\u201d Mohammed El Hindawi told me, \u201cis that my kids will be doctors so one day they can go to Syria and look after the people and tell them about the life they found in Canada.\u201d But even though Canadians elected Trudeau\u2019s refugee-friendly government, repeated polls show we are almost evenly split on whether to take them in. And there is ample evidence to be found, without having to spend much time looking, that our welcoming attitude sits in fragile balance. Parallels between 20th-century antisemitism and 21st-century Islamophobia Because of the rise in women in headscarves who are being assaulted, and harassed, an increasing number of self-defence courses for Muslim women are being offered across Canada. I observed one, last fall, where 50 Muslim women in loose-fitting clothes gathered in an Edmonton school gymnasium. This course was organized by Alberta Muslim Public Affairs Council (Ampac), which also created an \u201cIslamophobia hotline\u201d. Ampac was launched after the Harper government proposed a ban on taking citizenship oaths under a niqab or burka. \u201cThat\u2019s when things started changing,\u201d Nakita Valerio, who sits on the council, told me during the self-defence course. \u201cPeople I know started talking to me about how Islam is not like other religions, repeating things about the hyper-sexualization of our men, a lot of talk about the hijab. I feel like I\u2019m under the microscope more.\u201d She had never expected this moment to come to Canada. Europe, where her family is from, yes, but not here. Six years ago, while in Florence, without any provocation whatsoever, a man grabbed Valerio by her head-scarf and whipped her into traffic while yelling at her to go home. Had he managed to tear off her headscarf, and not just chunks of hair, he would perhaps have seen that the Italian Canadian Muslim convert looked no different from his daughter. It was Valerio\u2019s first week wearing the hijab, and since moving back to her birthplace, Canada, Valerio has committed herself to countering Islamophobia. Last December, when a senior citizen was captured on video taunting hijabis at an Edmonton train station with a noose while singing O, Canada, Valerio and a friend returned to the scene of the crime to distribute flowers to women in headscarves for a day. The day after the Quebec City mosque shooting, she co-organized a vigil with close to 3,000 attendees braving the frigid Edmonton weather. The outpouring of support heartens her, but Valerio has a less-than-optimistic forecast for Muslims. \u201cI worry that people will get lost and burnt out, and as a result lessen their ability to take action. A similar set of circumstances happened before the second world war.\u201d Valerio, who is a student of Jewish Holocaust studies, added: \u201cAs a veiled woman, I say, with no disrespect to the Holocaust, that we are today\u2019s Jews.\u201d The comparison is jarring, but clear parallels between 20th-century antisemitism and 21st-century Islamophobia are emerging. The uncapturably sickening treatment of Jews, not just in the last century, but throughout so many historical periods, is a pattern that appears to be finding a new modern expression. Frances Henry, a Jewish refugee of Hitler\u2019s Germany, and co-author of The Colour of Democracy: Racism in Canadian Society, recognizes the rhetoric coming from rightwing populism. \u201cWhat are we to make of it,\u201d she writes, \u201cother than there is a new scapegoat?\u201d Isis has, of course, simply carried the fear of the other to its logical conclusion, an all-out global war, and is appealing to the disenfranchised abroad using the same online tools as white supremacists. The more intolerant the west becomes, the easier their job. With every Islamophobic event another alienated Muslim is radicalized. With every terrorist attack, another alienated non-Muslim is radicalized. \u2018Our goals are just to survive.\u2019 Despite the various xenophobic undercurrents flowing through their new home, Mohammed El Hindawi and Sharef Sharf have nevertheless fully embraced the values of multiculturalism. Not that they are naive about the precariousness of tolerance. Worried that another attack perpetrated by Muslim extremists will compromise his living conditions, El Hindawi told me, \u201cIf I find out that one of my neighbours is doing these things, I will take them to the police myself.\u201d By the end of our evening together, my father had all but given up on translating, and it became three men fervently debating in Arabic about Canadian cultural differences and the futility of Middle Eastern politics. It felt like a scene from my childhood, sitting quietly in living rooms, with abundant fruit, tea and sweets spread across a coffee table, being entertained by the impassioned discussions of adults. I overheard, in my limited Arabic, my father ask if they worried that their religion and culture would be seduced away from his children. Sharf said he wasn\u2019t the slightest concerned, and he and my father debated over the importance of retaining their culture. \u201cDon\u2019t you want your kids to stay Muslim, marry a Muslim, and not say, \u2018Get away from me\u2019 to the parents?\u201d my dad asked, apparently unconcerned that Exhibit A in this argument, his son, was beside him. \u201cNo,\u201d said Sharf, shaking his head. \u201cWe will just do what we can do.\u201d I interjected, and asked Sharf what he wanted from his new life. He paused, appearing suddenly emotional and silent, and thought about it with a blissful smile. \u201cDon\u2019t start singing now,\u201d my dad joked, anticipating the man might break out in song. Sharf laughed. \u201cOur goals are just to survive.\u201d He looked at each of us in turn. \u201cThese are not big goals.\u201d Looking for more great work from Eighteen Bridges, the magazine of narrative journalism from Alberta, Canada?

          "bodyText": "Donald Trump has pulled back from a potential trade war with Europe by postponing a decision on imposing steel and aluminum tariffs until 1 June. The US president imposed a worldwide 25% tariff on steel imports and a 10% tariff on aluminum in March but granted temporary exemptions to Canada, Mexico, Brazil, the European Union (EU), Australia and Argentina. These were due to expire at 12.01am on Tuesday. The extension offers temporary reprieve for the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and German chancellor, Angela Merkel, who lobbied Trump during visits to the White House last week. It could also be seen by political analysts as the latest issue on which Trump\u2019s bark has proved worse than his bite. The administration \u201creached agreements in principle with Argentina, Australia, and Brazil with respect to steel and aluminum, the details of which will be finalized shortly\u201d, the White House said on Monday. \u201cThe Administration is also extending negotiations with Canada, Mexico, and the European Union for a final 30 days.\u201d Trump, who ran on a nationalist \u201cAmerica first\u201d agenda, claims the tariffs are needed to protect American metal producers from unfair competition and enhance national security amid a worldwide oversupply of steel and aluminum largely blamed on excess production in China. At a joint press conference with Merkel at the White House last week, the president said: \u201cWe need a reciprocal relationship, which we don\u2019t have \u2026 We\u2019re working on it and we want to make it more fair and the chancellor wants to make it more fair.\u201d But the move threatens to spark a trade war that could cause turmoil in financial markets. The EU \u2013 which is the biggest US trading partner \u2013 has warned that, if it is subject to tariffs on the \u20ac6.4bn ($7.7bn) worth of the metals it exports annually to the US, it will retaliate with its own tariffs on \u20ac2.8bn ($3.4bn) worth of US goods imported into Europe including Harley-Davidson motorcycles, Levi\u2019s jeans and Kentucky bourbon. The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, said in March: \u201cIf the Americans impose tariffs on steel and aluminium, then we must treat American products the same way. We must show that we can also take measures. This cannot be a unilateral transatlantic action by the Americans.\u201d And at the weekend the German government said Merkel, Macron and Britain\u2019s Theresa May had agreed, after conferring by phone, that if the tariffs were imposed, \u201cthe European Union should be ready to decisively defend its interests within the framework of multilateral trade rules\u201d. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said on Monday that any move by Washington to impose tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum would be a \u201cvery bad idea\u201d bound to disrupt trade between the two countries. Canada is the biggest source of steel imports into the US. Administration officials have said that in lieu of tariffs, countries that export steel and aluminum would have to agree to quotas designed to achieve similar protections for US producers.

Donald Trump, standing beside Emmanuel Macron, told reporters: \u201cMr President, they\u2019re all saying what a great relationship we have, and they\u2019re actually correct,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not fake news.\u201d The French leader grinned. Then, with unexpected intimacy, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2018/apr/24/ill-get-that-little-piece-of-dandruff-off-says-trump-as-he-flicks-at-macrons-jacket-video\">Trump reached for Macron\u2019s shoulder.</a> \u201cIn fact, I\u2019ll get that little piece of dandruff off; you have a little piece. We have to make him perfect. He is perfect.\u201d<br></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/27/angela-merkel-donald-trump-white-house-visit\">Trump and Merkel tried \u2013 and failed \u2013 to hide their differences in Washington</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>That night, TV host <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/apr/25/trevor-noah-french-president-macron-belle-trump-beast\">Stephen Colbert observed:</a> \u201cMr President, Macron is still standing next to you, smiling, after hanging out with you for two days. That\u2019s not dandruff \u2013 that\u2019s cocaine.\u201d But while many Americans rolled their eyes at 71-year-old Trump\u2019s silverback impression, no less striking was the impeccable response of Macron, 40, graciously laughing along with the joke and giving no hint of being thrown off his game.</p> \n<p>Indeed, during the first state visit of the Trump presidency, the Frenchman offered a masterclass in how to play this most skittish of commanders-in-chief. Tactile and tactful, he established himself firmly in the front rank of Trump\u2019s favourite leaders alongside Japan\u2019s Shinz\u014d Abe, Israel\u2019s Benjamin Netanyahu, Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, China\u2019s Xi Jinping and, most cryptically, Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin.</p> \n<p>Notably all are men and, in style or substance, strongmen. That bodes ill for Theresa May, who will host Trump in July, and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. The women lead fragile coalition governments, likely to be a sign of weakness in this US president\u2019s eyes, and have proved unable, or unwilling, to flatter his ego.</p> \n<p>The contrast in body language was brutal on Friday when Merkel paid a lower-key visit and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/27/angela-merkel-donald-trump-white-house-visit\">held a joint press conference.</a> Behind the same lecterns in the East Room, Trump and Macron shared a man hug with the US president declaring, \u201cI like him a lot.\u201d Trump and Merkel engaged only in stiff handshakes. As they departed, Trump put his hand towards her back but did not touch.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a5414e90-b60b-407a-ba6d-83f26b35eba1\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4I97fq8DorE?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>During the question and answer session, Trump rambled about how \u201cWashington can be a very mean place; you don\u2019t know about that, chancellor\u201d, and joked about how quickly people in Germany can get fired. Merkel\u2019s chilly reaction \u2013 eyebrows raised, a frown, a grimace, a forced half-smile \u2013 raised the question of how she would have reacted to the dandruff move.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Even this Putin stuff, a lot of it is, \u2018I think I get on with him, I think I could deal with him'</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Western diplomat</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>How to handle Trump\u2019s improvisational, barely briefed approach to global affairs has been a puzzle for world leaders. \u201cI think he wants to be liked,\u201d said one western diplomat, who attended a meeting between Trump and his own country\u2019s leader. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to strike up a rapport, find some kind of common ground, find something that gets him in a positive frame of mind.\u201d</p> \n<p>The diplomat, who did not wish to be named, observed how Trump sees foreign policy through the prism of relationships. \u201cI would say personal rapport is probably more important with him than it would be with a more conventional president. The idea that getting on with someone is what\u2019s crucial to the outcome of the discussions wouldn\u2019t normally be the way people see it. But he\u2019s inclined to see it as a question of personal chemistry. Even this Putin stuff, a lot of it is, \u2018I think I get on with him, I think I could deal with him.\u2019</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a belief in his personal responsibility to shape things in his favour. As a businessman, as a dealmaker, as someone who\u2019s been involved in real estate deals all his life, I think those kind of personal relationships he builds up are important to him, so I wouldn\u2019t undervalue it all. But whether it produces the goods in the case of Macron, let\u2019s wait and see.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>The \u2018Trump whisperers\u2019</strong></h2> \n<p>There has been keen competition for the role of \u201cTrump whisperer\u201d. A White House source said Macron and Abe, the prime minister of Japan, have spoken to the president by phone more often than any other leader. Abe was the first suitor at Trump Tower after the 2016 election, giving the president-elect a $3,800 golden golf club. He followed up at Trump\u2019s luxury Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida soon after. When the American president reciprocated with a visit to Japan, he was treated to a state dinner, a white hat embroidered with \u201cDonald &amp; Shinzo, Make Alliance Even Greater\u201d in gold thread and a round of golf.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f6dbf5cb5bee8f9f0494695b2d2435d85bfde86a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f6dbf5cb5bee8f9f0494695b2d2435d85bfde86a/0_176_3972_2383/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Angela Merkel speaks in the East Room of the White House.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Angela Merkel speaks in the East Room of the White House.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Abe visited Mar-a-Lago again earlier this month and played another round.

          "bodyText": "It is safe to assume that the Oval Office had never before witnessed the practice of dandruff diplomacy. Donald Trump, standing beside Emmanuel Macron, told reporters: \u201cMr President, they\u2019re all saying what a great relationship we have, and they\u2019re actually correct,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not fake news.\u201d The French leader grinned. Then, with unexpected intimacy, Trump reached for Macron\u2019s shoulder. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019ll get that little piece of dandruff off; you have a little piece. We have to make him perfect. He is perfect.\u201d That night, TV host Stephen Colbert observed: \u201cMr President, Macron is still standing next to you, smiling, after hanging out with you for two days. That\u2019s not dandruff \u2013 that\u2019s cocaine.\u201d But while many Americans rolled their eyes at 71-year-old Trump\u2019s silverback impression, no less striking was the impeccable response of Macron, 40, graciously laughing along with the joke and giving no hint of being thrown off his game. Indeed, during the first state visit of the Trump presidency, the Frenchman offered a masterclass in how to play this most skittish of commanders-in-chief. Tactile and tactful, he established himself firmly in the front rank of Trump\u2019s favourite leaders alongside Japan\u2019s Shinz\u014d Abe, Israel\u2019s Benjamin Netanyahu, Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, China\u2019s Xi Jinping and, most cryptically, Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin. Notably all are men and, in style or substance, strongmen. That bodes ill for Theresa May, who will host Trump in July, and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. The women lead fragile coalition governments, likely to be a sign of weakness in this US president\u2019s eyes, and have proved unable, or unwilling, to flatter his ego. The contrast in body language was brutal on Friday when Merkel paid a lower-key visit and held a joint press conference. Behind the same lecterns in the East Room, Trump and Macron shared a man hug with the US president declaring, \u201cI like him a lot.\u201d Trump and Merkel engaged only in stiff handshakes. As they departed, Trump put his hand towards her back but did not touch. During the question and answer session, Trump rambled about how \u201cWashington can be a very mean place; you don\u2019t know about that, chancellor\u201d, and joked about how quickly people in Germany can get fired. Merkel\u2019s chilly reaction \u2013 eyebrows raised, a frown, a grimace, a forced half-smile \u2013 raised the question of how she would have reacted to the dandruff move. How to handle Trump\u2019s improvisational, barely briefed approach to global affairs has been a puzzle for world leaders. \u201cI think he wants to be liked,\u201d said one western diplomat, who attended a meeting between Trump and his own country\u2019s leader. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to strike up a rapport, find some kind of common ground, find something that gets him in a positive frame of mind.\u201d The diplomat, who did not wish to be named, observed how Trump sees foreign policy through the prism of relationships. \u201cI would say personal rapport is probably more important with him than it would be with a more conventional president. The idea that getting on with someone is what\u2019s crucial to the outcome of the discussions wouldn\u2019t normally be the way people see it. But he\u2019s inclined to see it as a question of personal chemistry. Even this Putin stuff, a lot of it is, \u2018I think I get on with him, I think I could deal with him.\u2019 \u201cIt\u2019s a belief in his personal responsibility to shape things in his favour. As a businessman, as a dealmaker, as someone who\u2019s been involved in real estate deals all his life, I think those kind of personal relationships he builds up are important to him, so I wouldn\u2019t undervalue it all. But whether it produces the goods in the case of Macron, let\u2019s wait and see.\u201d The \u2018Trump whisperers\u2019 There has been keen competition for the role of \u201cTrump whisperer\u201d. A White House source said Macron and Abe, the prime minister of Japan, have spoken to the president by phone more often than any other leader. Abe was the first suitor at Trump Tower after the 2016 election, giving the president-elect a $3,800 golden golf club. He followed up at Trump\u2019s luxury Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida soon after. When the American president reciprocated with a visit to Japan, he was treated to a state dinner, a white hat embroidered with \u201cDonald &amp; Shinzo, Make Alliance Even Greater\u201d in gold thread and a round of golf. Abe visited Mar-a-Lago again earlier this month and played another round. But is all this effort \u2013 undignified sycophancy in the eyes of critics \u2013 worth it? For Abe there is already talk of buyer\u2019s remorse. Trump carried out this threat to quit the Trans-Pacific Partnership and blindsided Tokyo by agreeing to meet the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-un, to discuss denuclearisation. Jon Alterman, a senior vice-president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said: \u201cWhere does it get you? There\u2019s certainly an argument to be made in Japan that Abe has bent over backwards to court Trump yet on several crucial issues, like North Korea, Japan is outside the room looking in instead of inside the room looking out.\u201d Others who cosy up to Trump could meet a similar fate.

Thinking time As the Anzac 100 commemorations draw to a close, Paul Daley tries to make sense of what the day has become. \u201cSo eager was I for clarification about this Anzac myth and of what it might tell me about Australia that I\u2019ve visited many times the important first world war battlefields \u2026 where the Australians died in the heat and the dust or drowned slowly in the mud while screaming for their mothers. And I\u2019ve also traipsed around this country visiting the places where, by some accounts, just as many tens of thousands of Indigenous people died fighting the British redcoats and their proxies,\u201d he writes. In 2012, a team of researchers and academics from the UNSW Canberra put out a call to Vietnam veterans: Operation Wandering Souls sought to reunite artefacts, memorabilia and ephemera from the Vietnam war with their Vietnamese owners. In some cases, it was hoped, items such as photographs, diaries, letters or documents might help trace the whereabouts of the graves of some of Vietnam\u2019s 300,000 soldiers missing in action from the conflict. Vietnam veteran Derrill de Heer says it has been deeply emotional \u2013 on all sides \u2013 for objects to be returned to the descendants of soldiers. The film-maker Warwick Thornton will hand-deliver a copy of his critically acclaimed Australian western, Sweet Country, to the community of Dubbo this Friday, following a months-long campaign to bring the film to the regional New South Wales city. More than 400 tickets have been sold to the one-off screening. \u201cSweet Country is a cinematic experience that should be seen on the big screen, in order to do it justice. I felt this was important particularly for the Dubbo community, due to our high Indigenous population,\u201d says screenwriter Kellie Jennar, who spearheaded the campaign. \u201cThis is a culturally important film and they are the closest cinema within a three-hour round trip.\u201d What\u2019s he done now? Donald Trump has dismissed a query about whether he is considering pardoning his personal attorney, Michael Cohen, as \u201ca stupid question\u201d. The longtime Trump subordinate has come under increased scrutiny after the FBI raided his New York office, home and hotel room on 9 April. Trump called the raid \u201can attack on our country in a true sense\u201d. Media roundup The Australian has a long read by Caroline Overington into the untold story of a black hawk helicopter which crashed in Afghanistan in 2010, killing three Australian commandos and wounding 11. What really happened that day \u2013 and what became of the wounded soldiers? The West Australian has a striking front page, recreating a painting of the battle of Villers Bretonneux, where Australian diggers turned the tide of the first world war. It also report on how the City of Perth has been criticised for its poor emergency management plan, and instructed to install emergency sirens at strategic locations. And the ABC investigates whether your local cafe\u2019s surcharge is actually going to the staff working on a public holiday. Coming up The prime minister will attend the centenary of the first world war battle at Villers-Bretonneux with an Anzac Day service and wreath-laying ceremony. Dawn services will be held at cenotaphs across the country. Collingwood and Essendon will take to the field in round five of the AFL, and in the NRL, St George Illawarra will take on the Sydney Roosters and Melbourne Storm play the NZ Warriors.

As presents from France to the US go, some have pointed out that this tree <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statue_of_Liberty\">is not exactly up there with the Statue of Liberty</a>.

As well as demonstrating the kind of epic hair flick that belongs on catwalks or in shampoo adverts (which would make sense, given Melania\u2019s former modelling career) it\u2019s interesting to speculate what she might be hiding under the cape. Perhaps a carry-on, containing all the stuff one needs when one is planning to run away from one\u2019s awful husband?

This is a man who in the past has declared support for gay rights but is obsessed with phallic machismo, usually touching the hands of men only in a bid to one-up them in a crushing handshake.

          "bodyText": "Never will we be gifted such a dream set of press photos as the three day Macron-Trump t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate, the first day of which has seen the foursome visit the former home of George Washington and awkwardly plant a tree. As presents from France to the US go, some have pointed out that this tree is not exactly up there with the Statue of Liberty. The tree is more of a flowers-from-the-petrol station sort of effort. (It is, though, apparently significant foliage, in that the oak grew on one of France\u2019s former first world war battlefields). The Macrons\u2019 trip is the first state visit from foreign leaders to Trump, who is the first president in 100 years not to have held a state visit in his first year of office. It\u2019s difficult to be a good host, between watching Fox &amp; Friends, tweeting relentlessly and egregiously offending most sections of society at a whim. But Trump chose the Macrons as a return invitation after he and Melania spent Bastille Day with the Macrons in Paris. Let us take a closer look at the latest couples\u2019 minibreak. We begin with the above image, which I have titled, in homage to Magritte, Ceci n\u2019est pas un avion. Because frankly, there is a glaring omission here. I care about this image because Brigitte\u2019s coat is amazing. There\u2019s a Jackie Onassis colour-match here (albeit specifically the outfit Onassis wore on the day of JFK\u2019s assassination). The coat is Louis Vuitton, one of Brigitte\u2019s favourite labels. The cigarette pants are tr\u00e8s French. Her husband is simply dressed as a standard Amis, ie. A Man in a Suit. But I note that Melania also chose a French designer to wear (Givenchy, with Louboutin shoes); more on this outfit anon. Here\u2019s Macron doing \u201cthe Blair\u201d hand gesture, since developed as the centrist premier hand-move du jour. We\u2019ve seen Barack Obama and Justin Trudeau utilise it, and even Angela Merkel. I have never seen anybody other than a politician do this with hands when they speak. The main event, the tree-planting. What I enjoy about this photograph is that neither Melania nor Brigitte has any remote intention of helping, while Trump and Macron bury their dying approval ratings and, perhaps in Trump\u2019s case, Michael Cohen\u2019s paper trail from the Stormy Daniels case. And the Steele dossier. And all other intel on Russia. He\u2019ll probably be finished by nightfall. Meanwhile, Brigitte has the pose of someone who just landed a red and a green on her first two moves in a game of Twister. Perhaps the best shot of the bunch, because: Melania. As well as demonstrating the kind of epic hair flick that belongs on catwalks or in shampoo adverts (which would make sense, given Melania\u2019s former modelling career) it\u2019s interesting to speculate what she might be hiding under the cape. Perhaps a carry-on, containing all the stuff one needs when one is planning to run away from one\u2019s awful husband? Or perhaps this is why the Macrons apparently didn\u2019t need a plane, because Melania flew them over. We just don\u2019t know. Please, give it up for random harp lady. Your typical woodland stage headliner at Latitude Festival. Note Trump\u2019s tepid wave \u2013 which, I\u2019ll be honest, is probably the correct response. The others are ignoring the harp lady, in the manner of one quickening one\u2019s pace, head down, past a tube station busker with an eccentric instrument. I respect your decision to play the oboe sir, but is it really working at the bottom of an escalator in King\u2019s Cross? I\u2019m gonna let the body-language speak for itself here \u2013 because Melania, straight up, wants no part of this life any longer. Given that French men kiss readily even as part of a polite greeting, this hand-holding won\u2019t mean much to Macron. But for Trump it\u2019s as though he\u2019s gone to his first Pride and decided to become an ally. This is a man who in the past has declared support for gay rights but is obsessed with phallic machismo, usually touching the hands of men only in a bid to one-up them in a crushing handshake. He\u2019s also prone to boasting about the size of his penis. Or rather, defending the size of his penis. In this picture, however, Trump looks like he\u2019s leading his new husband away to the helicopter to fly to Turks and Caicos for a honeymoon, with a dolphin swim booked for day three. At the end of a successful first day, the vibe here is very much reunited 70s band embarking on an arena tour because funds are running dry and those basement extensions in Notting Hill aren\u2019t going to build themselves. \u201cThank you, Milton Keynes!\u201d Even the colour matching works.

While the city\u2019s police chief said there was nothing to indicate the suspect was armed at the time of his arrest, Saunders commended the officer for doing a \u201cfantastic job\u201d, saying that \u201cofficers here are taught to use as little force as possible in any given situation\u201d. The incident took place about 12 miles from the city centre, where foreign ministers from the G7 countries were meeting to discuss international issues before the G7 summit near Quebec City in June. Toronto\u2019s mayor, John Tory, described the incident as a \u201ccowardly and incomprehensible attack\u201d on Monday. \u201cThese are not the kinds of things we expect to happen in this city,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope that we will as a city remind ourselves of the fact that we are admired around the world for being inclusive, for being accepting and understanding and considerate.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 1 May 2018 to correct the distance from the city centre from 18 miles to 12 miles.",

All night, like mating baboons, gibbons.\u201d The kids, meanwhile, ran wild. Eventually his mother wanted out, and settled back in Britain with Noa and his brother. \u201cWhen I eventually did get back to this country when I was 10 I couldn\u2019t read anything or write anything, or do two plus two,\u201d says Noa.

          "bodyText": "Top story: \u2018Anyone in his way, he would hit\u2019 Hello, it\u2019s Warren Murray with the early news. Ten people are dead after a van was driven along the sidewalk in Toronto, ploughing into pedestrians. The drama ended in the arrest of Alek Minassian, 25, from the nearby town of Richmond Hill. Police and the government said there appeared to be no immediate connection to terrorism. Apart from the dead, another 15 people were injured. Onlookers have told of their horror after the van mounted the kerb of Yonge Street in the north of Canada\u2019s biggest city around lunchtime on Monday and carved a trail of carnage two kilometres long. \u201cAnybody in his way, he would hit,\u201d said Ali Shaker, who was driving nearby. Another witness said: \u201cI just came out from a subway station and I saw a crazy van, a rental van, hitting people one after one. I saw an old man going up and going down.\u201d Here\u2019s more of what we can tell you this morning. Video taken by onlookers captures the extraordinary moment a Toronto police officer stares down the suspect, who points an object as if it is a gun while standing next to the damaged van. \u201cGet down \u2026 get down or you\u2019ll be shot!\u201d the officer yells, levelling his own pistol, before walking straight up to the man who then lies on the ground to be handcuffed. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, expressed sympathy for the victims and their families, and praised first responders. \u201cWe should all feel safe walking in our cities and communities,\u201d he said. Toronto\u2019s mayor, John Tory, said it was a \u201ccowardly and incomprehensible attack\u201d, adding: \u201cI hope that we will as a city remind ourselves of the fact that we are admired around the world for being inclusive, for being accepting and understanding and considerate.\u201d * * * \u2018Treasured sword\u2019 \u2013 Kim Jong-un has pledged to keep North Korea\u2019s nuclear arsenal for generations, throwing into doubt the prospect that talks with Donald Trump will be as \u201cfruitful\u201d as the latter hopes. Kim said the halt to testing he declared over the weekend was possible because the regime had built a viable nuclear deterrent. The North\u2019s arsenal was a \u201cpowerful treasured sword for defending peace\u201d and \u201ca firm guarantee by which our descendants can enjoy the most dignified and happiest life in the world\u201d. It doesn\u2019t sound much like the \u201cdenuclearisation\u201d that was hailed by the US president on Twitter. The White House spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, said she would \u201cleave that to the president and Kim Jong-un to walk through\u201d. * * * \u2018Pray for Alfie\u2019 \u2013 Alfie Evans was taken off life support last night. A high court judge gave the go-ahead for doctors at Alder Hey children\u2019s hospital in Liverpool to withdraw life support from the 23-month-old boy, who had a rare degenerative brain condition. On Monday afternoon, police blocked protesters as they tried to enter the hospital in support of Alfie\u2019s parents, Tom Evans and Kate James, who had mounted a protracted legal campaign. Supreme court justices last week said: \u201cAlfie looks like a normal baby, but the unanimous opinion of the doctors who have examined him and the scans of his brain is that almost all of his brain has been destroyed \u2026 there is no hope of his ever getting better.\u201d * * * Peer pressure \u2013 Parliament continues to pick apart Theresa May\u2019s Brexit plans, with the Lords inflicting a fresh defeat by voting to retain the fundamental charter of EU rights. The government lost a series of other votes that could have given ministers the power to restrict when citizens could use principles of EU law to challenge the government; while a compromise was reached on post-EU public health protections. Senior Tory leavers continue to be gripped by a phobia of anything that suggests a customs union \u2013 they want Theresa May to rule out even a \u201ccustoms partnership\u201d. May\u2019s team has privately admitted she may have to accept permanent membership of a European customs union, while senior Conservatives are said to be drawing up a customs union \u201cin all but name\u201d to try and broker peace with the Brexiters. * * * Legacy of Rana Plaza \u2013 Five years after 1,134 people died in a garment factory collapse, Bangladesh has made inroads when it comes to protecting workers. \u201cI think right now, of the developing countries with a ready-made garment sector, Bangladesh is the safest,\u201d says Rob Wayss, executive director of one of the safety accords that resulted from the 2013 disaster. But those deals are coming to an end, and they don\u2019t cover workers in the many factories supplying non-western brands anyway. The garment sector complains western clothing retailers want it both ways \u2013 safety and minimum pay, but also ever-lower prices. Factory owners are happy to see safety accords wound down, while the government is reluctant to step up and enforce standards. As one labour advocate put it: \u201cIt is scary to imagine that things could go back to business as usual.\u201d * * * Bum dial \u2013 Vodafone has been named Britain\u2019s worst mobile phone provider \u2013 for the seventh consecutive year. \u201cThese findings published by Which? really don\u2019t match up with what our customers are telling us,\u201d said a Vodafone spokesman \u2013 possibly demonstrating where the problem partly lies. EE, which last year shared the dubious distinction with Vodafone, came second-last in this survey. Utility Warehouse came in first \u2013 while the Telefonica/BT subsidiary GiffGaff came in second and Sky Mobile was third. Lunchtime read: \u2018Like baboons having sex\u2019 Adult life inside a free-love cult was laid bare in a recent Netflix documentary, Wild Wild Country. Our TV critic Sam Wollaston, though, wondered what became of the children \u201cseen running around in the background\u201d. Wollaston tracked down Noa Maxwell, whose bohemian parents gravitated in the mid-1970s to controversial guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh\u2019s ashram, first in India and later in Oregon. \u201cWe had been a tight, 70s middle-class family, and within a very short period that family unit was ripped up,\u201d says Noa, now 46. In the cult, adults immersed themselves in the search for a higher consciousness, and free love \u2013 \u201cYou could hear people having orgasmic sex all the time. All night, like mating baboons, gibbons.\u201d The kids, meanwhile, ran wild. Eventually his mother wanted out, and settled back in Britain with Noa and his brother. \u201cWhen I eventually did get back to this country when I was 10 I couldn\u2019t read anything or write anything, or do two plus two,\u201d says Noa. He tells how the experience left him damaged but also determined to be \u201cas normal as possible \u2013 I made a lot of choices that would give me something solid\u201d. Sport The England and Wales Cricket Board will meet representatives from the country\u2019s 420 professional players next month following a backlash over its new 100\u2011ball competition. At Goodison Park last night, one banner called for Sam Allardyce to go during Everton\u2019s 1-0 win over Newcastle but Theo Walcott\u2019s sharp finish shielded the manager from further hostility. London Marathon organisers are already lining up Mo Farah to run in next year\u2019s race while his coach, Gary Lough, believes he could yet reach a \u201csimilar level\u201d as the winner this year, Eliud Kipchoge. And Dylan Hartley will miss England\u2019s three-Test tour to South Africa in June after being told to take the summer off following his latest concussion. Business Asian stocks bounced from near two-week lows on Tuesday, as investors paused for breath following the heavy selling of recent sessions and waited to see if the dollar\u2019s rally was sustainable. The pound has been trading at $1.394 and \u20ac1.141 The papers It\u2019s the Cambridges\u2019 day on the front pages after they presented to the cameras their new baby boy, born on St George\u2019s Day. \u201cThrice the worry now\u201d is the Express headline, quoting William. \u201cHis first royal wave!\u201d gushes the Mail, with a close-up of the baby\u2019s face and tiny uncurled hand. \u201cTriple crown\u201d says the Mirror while the Sun has fun with a bit of Shakespeare \u2013 \u201cCry for Mummy, England and St George\u201d \u2013 because the newborn also shares the Bard\u2019s birthday. Back to serious business: the Guardian splashes on the Windrush generation and Theresa May\u2019s promise of citizenship and speedy compensation for those affected. \u201cRuddy awful,\u201d fumes the Mirror, accusing Theresa May of authoring the debacle but letting Amber Rudd take the heat. The Times reports Rudd has promised a change of culture at the Home Office on migration.

You can read our latest story on the incident here. 10 people have been killed and 15 injured after they were hit by a rental van, driven along the sidewalk in Toronto for more than 2km The incident began at about 1.30pm at a busy intersection in the city\u2019s north The majority of victims are yet to be identified The driver, 25-year-old Alek Manassian, is in custody after being arrested in a dramatic confrontation with a police officer Police said the actions \u201cdefinitely looked deliberate\u201d but they don\u2019t know what motivation was behind it Police said all lines of inquiry remain open but there is no suggestion based on current information that there is any link to national security Authorities have urged witnesses to contact police with any information The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, expressed sympathy for the victims and their families, and praised first responders. \u201cWe are monitoring this situation closely, and will continue working with our law enforcement partners around the country to ensure the safety and security of all Canadians.\u201d The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has issued the following statement: It was with great sadness that I heard about the tragic and senseless attack that took place in Toronto this afternoon. On behalf of all Canadians, I offer my heartfelt condolences to the loved ones of those who were killed, and my thoughts for a fast and full recovery to those injured. I thank the first responders at the scene who managed this extremely difficult situation with courage and professionalism. They faced danger without hesitation, and their efforts no doubt saved lives and prevented further injuries. We should all feel safe walking in our cities and communities. We are monitoring this situation closely, and will continue working with our law enforcement partners around the country to ensure the safety and security of all Canadians. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, the Mexican president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, and former Canadian PM Stephen Harper are among those who have expressed condolences to Canada and the people of Toronto. The Toronto Star has published an editorial, praising the city\u2019s residents and authorities for their responses to the tragic event. Police \u201cstuck to the facts\u201d, and the public \u201cby and large also refused to indulge in finger-pointing or blame-throwing\u201d, it said. There was no over-reaction, in particular by the arresting officer. This confrontation could easily have ended in yet another death, and it must have taken remarkable restraint to avoid shooting in the heat of such a charged moment. The driver is alive to face justice and, just as important for the public good, to give his own explanation of why he inflicted this horror. All this speaks very well of the city we call home. We cannot prevent all violence in our midst; there will always be individuals who lash out for personal or political reasons and take innocent life. But we can do something about how we react collectively when we come under attack. It would have been all too easy for things to have turned very ugly very quickly in the wake of Monday\u2019s attack. Police have set up a web portal for witnesses to share videos and photos of the incident. A quick summary of that press conference, where we heard from the police chief, Mark Saunders, the premier, Kathleen Wynne, the minister of public safety, Ralph Goodale, and the Toronto mayor, John Tory. The death toll has now risen to 10, with 15 people injured after the man - now named as 25-year-old Alek Menassian \u2013 drove off the road and into a number of pedestrians over the course of several kilometres at about 1.30pm. The majority of victims have not yet been identified. While the actions \u201cdefinitely look deliberate\u201d police have not identified any motivation. There is nothing to link the act with any national security situation and the city is safe, they said. Police are calling for witnesses to contact them using a dedicated hotline or web portal. Some further points from the press conference: Authorities are assessing Canada\u2019s threat level, but the city is safe, says Saunders. The majority of victims have not yet been identified. Toronto police are leading the homicide investigations, but they are working in concert with federal and provincial counterparts. Saunders is being asked about a range of possible motivations but will not be drawn on any of them. The investigation is ongoing. Charges have not been laid yet. Saunders praises the training of Canadian police to use as little force as possible, when asked about the peaceful arrest of Alek Minassian. Reporters are asking further questions about national security. The police chief, Mark Saunders, says the minister didn\u2019t dismiss the possibility it was terrorism-related, but that the information currently didn\u2019t find any connection. \u201cWe are looking very strongly to what the exact motivation was for this particular incident to take place.\u201d \u201cThe actions definitely look deliberate,\u201d he later says. The driver, Alek Minassian, is not known to police. There is no current suggestion of a national security risk because of this incident, says Ralph Goodale, Canada\u2019s minister of public safety and emergency preparedness. \u201cOn the basis of all available information at the present time there would appear to be no national security connection to this particular incident,\u201d Goodale says. \u201cThe events ... are horrendous but they do not appear to be connected in any way to national security based on the information available at this time.\u201d Kathleen Wynne, premier of Ontario, praises the first responders for a professional and comprehensive response. She says the outreach from across the country has been \u201coutstanding\u201d. \u201cPeople across the country are thinking about what\u2019s happening here in Toronto, thinking about the families and the victims.\u201d Toronto mayor, John Tory, says he hopes for people who live in Toronto \u201cthis tragic incident is not representative of how we live or who we are or anything to do with how we live in this city on a day-to-day basis\u201d. He hoped people would \u201ccarry on \u2013 with heavy hearts \u2013 but carry on\u201d. Tory calls for anyone who witnessed the incident to contact the police. Police a short time ago sent out the following message: Anyone with information is asked to please call the investigative hotline at 416-808-8750. A web portal has been opened for anyone who is able to submit photos and/or videos of the incident, please click here. Police are also asking the public to please refrain from calling 911 unless they are in a life or death emergency. The death toll has risen to 10, according to the police chief, Mark Saunders. Police have named the driver as 25-year-old Alek Minassian from Richmond Hill, Ontario. Social media identifies him as a college student. Police have cordoned off an area stretching close to a kilometre, for the investigation, which involves several levels of law enforcement. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take some time to process the scene,\u201d Saunders said. More than six hours after the incident bodies remain in the street, covered in bright orange tarps, reports Leyland Cecco from the scene. An impromptu memorial had already been set up less than 50m from one of the victims. \u201cIt could\u2019ve been anybody,\u201d said Konstantin Goulich, who has lived across the street for 15 years. \u201cWe live in a unified society. And people\u2019s support and outpouring of grief is evidence of this.\u201d A short time ago a playoffs game between the Toronto Maple Leafs and Boston Bruins opened with tributes to victims of the fatal incident. CBC has spoken to a number of eyewitnesses. \u201cI just came out from a subway station and I saw a crazy van, a rental van, hitting people one after one,\u201d said one man. \u201cI saw an old man going up and going down. The people were screaming and going around. He drove really fast.\u201d Taxi driver Nana Agyeman-Badu described one woman being hit at a bus stop. He and another driver stopped. \u201cThe two of us were trying to help her, telling her she\u2019s going to be OK.\u201d Citing government officials, CBC says the driver is not associated with any known terrorist organisations. We are working to confirm that. A press conference will be held in about 15 minutes. Toronto councillor John Filion represents the Willowdale neighbourhood in north Toronto, where the attack occurred. He spoke to CBC a littler earlier. \u201cIt\u2019s just a shock that it could happen in our city, that it could happen anywhere in our city,\u201d he said. \u201cThe area I represent is, you know, very harmonious. We have people from all over the world and everybody gets along very well. You know, you rarely even encounter an angry person in the area. \u201cIt\u2019s just, you know, incomprehensible.\u201d Premier of Ontario, Kathleen Wynne, spoke to media a little earlier. \u201cI\u2019ve been briefed by the provincial security advisor and what I want people to know is that all levels of government and police services are working together. The OPP, the RCMP, and the Toronto police service, all levels are working together and the information is flowing among those organisations,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no gap there and I will continue to get updates.\u201d Ten of the victims were taken to Sunnybrook hospital\u2019s trauma centre. A spokesman gave a press conference a little earlier. He said two injured pedestrians who were taken to the hospital had succumbed to their injuries. Another five were in a critical condition, and three were in a serious condition. One of those in a serious condition was previously in a fair condition, but deteriorated. All of the victims were adults, the spokesman said. Authorities were still in the process of identifying the two deceased, he said. We\u2019re expecting to hear another update from Toronto police tonight, local time. There is still no official word on the driver\u2019s motivation. The Toronto police remain the lead agency investigating the attack, but support has been provided by Canada\u2019s Mounted Police Force, the agency usually responsible for national security matters. Toronto\u2019s mayor, John Tory, has issued a statement on what he described as a \u201ccowardly and incomprehensible attack\u201d. \u201cOur city denounces this and all acts of violence and we are united in our grief over this devastating loss of life,\u201d he said. \u201cI encourage the people of Toronto to come together in support of those affected by this tragedy and those working to keep us safe \u2013 in particular to help the police by providing information. \u201cI ask everyone to await the result of thee police investigation and avoid speculation. Instead we should show the world that Toronto is a city that will not be cowed, will not be afraid, and will not waver in the values we hold dear.\u201d Vision posted to Twitter shows the stationary van, with extensive front-end damage. The driver confronts police with what appears to be a gun. Police can be heard telling the man to get down on the ground. \u201cKill me,\u201d he tells officers. An officer responds: \u201cNo, get on the ground.\u201d The man says: \u201cI have a gun in my pocket.\u201d Police warn him if he doesn\u2019t not get on the ground, they will shoot. The suspect is then arrested without firing any shots. Ralph Goodale, Canada\u2019s public safety minister, has described the incident as a \u201chorrific attack\u201d and thanked brave local police officers for their response. This map shows the path of the van, according to current information. The first reported collision was near the corner of Finch Avenue and Yonge Street. The van continued along the sidewalk for almost 3km along Yonge Street. Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has made a statement about the Toronto incident on Twitter, thanking first responders and expressing his sympathies to those affected. Witnesses have shared horrific first-person accounts of the scene near the Toronto intersection, on the corner of Yonge Street and Finch Avenue East. Christian Ali, who drove down Yonge Street shortly afterwards, said he saw three people lying in the street. \u201cThere was a lot of blood flowing,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cEveryone was in sheer shock.\u201d The Globe and Mail spoke to Michele Kelman, who was walking back to work after lunch with a friend at the time. Kelman said she heard screams and turned to see the white van heading towards her down the sidewalk. She was unhurt, but could not find her friend. \u201cMy friend was gone,\u201d Kelman told the Globe and Mail. \u201cI couldn\u2019t find her body for a while. There were a few around. And there were people trying to bring her back.\u201d Kelman said her friend did not survive. Details about the incident are scant. But this is what we know so far: The van mounted the kerb at a busy intersection in the northern suburbs of Toronto on Monday afternoon, about around 1.30pm local time. It continued almost 3km, striking dozens of pedestrians. Police have so far confirmed nine people are dead, and another 16 are injured. The van was a rental. The driver fled from police but was detained and arrested. Witnesses and video posted on social media suggest the man had aimed what appeared to be a gun at police, before being detained. Local media are reporting the man\u2019s identity, but law enforcement are yet to officially confirm the name. A van has struck pedestrians in Toronto, Canada, killing nine people and injuring 16. The van appeared to mount the curb and continue down the sidewalk, mowing down pedestrians as it went. The driver has been arrested. But questions remain about his motives, and investigators are yet to confirm the act was deliberate. Stay with us. We\u2019ll bring you developments as they happen.",

The suspect initially fled from police. Video posted on social media suggested the man had pointed an object at police before being detained. Police said the van incident appeared to have been deliberate but have not identified a motive. Canada\u2019s minister of public safety and emergency preparedness, Ralph Goodale, said there was \u201cno national security connection\u201d to the incident as yet. Prime minister Justin Trudeau offered his condolences to the loved ones of those killed in what he described as a \u201ctragic and senseless attack\u201d.",

After initially balking at the idea, the federal government \u2013 led by the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau \u2013 eventually approved the provisions. But no timeline has been set for thee changes, and the government now says that it must first consult with First Nations and other indigenous groups. \u201cThere\u2019s no way that anybody in the world should be consulting with somebody on whether or not they should continue to discriminate,\u201d said McIvor. Campaigners acknowledge that there are legitimate concerns over issues such as access to resources for the country\u2019s 1.6 million indigenous peoples, but they express concerns that the consultations are being used to further delay equality. \u201cWhat we\u2019re getting is words \u2013 nice words \u2013 but no action,\u201d said Shelagh Day of the Canadian Feminist Alliance for International Action. \u201cHow could this still be happening with a government that is committed to women\u2019s equality and that has said it\u2019s interested in a new nation-to-nation relationship?\u201d Previous comments from the government hint at concerns over the costs involved. A recent report from the country\u2019s parliamentary budget officer estimated that around 260,000 people would actually register if equality was granted \u2013 which could cost the government more than C$400m a year in health and education benefits. Several United Nations bodies have drawn a direct line between sexual discrimination in the Indian Act and Canada\u2019s crisis of missing and murdered indigenous women. In a 2015 report, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights cited the Indian Act as \u201can important factor in understanding the persistence of unequal treatment and stereotyping of indigenous women, which in turn continue to place indigenous women at an increased risk for multiple forms of violence\u201d. The push for change comes amid a wider conversation on replacing the Indian Act with the indigenous self-government and self-determination. But as long as the act endures, it must treat men and women equally, said Day. \u201cWhen the federal government is talking about forging a new nation-to-nation relationship with indigenous peoples, it seems critical that the pool of people with whom the new relationship is being forged not be distorted by colonial-era sex discrimination.\u201d In an email to the Guardian, the federal ministry responsible for the Indian Act said officials are working with First Nations communities and other partners to design consultations on eliminating the remaining sex-based discrimination in the act. The ministry declined to detail their timeline. After more than two decades of litigation, McIvor\u2019s grandchildren are now entitled to status but \u2013 unlike her brother\u2019s grandchildren \u2013 will not be able to pass this to successive generations. So her battle for equality continues. \u201cWhat I lost was a big piece of me, of who I am and how I was recognised. My people saw me as not one of them,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople say it\u2019s about getting your medical and your dental and your education. It has very little to do with that,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the recognition that I belong to this group of people. That they recognise me as belonging \u2013 and I recognise them. That was lost.\u201d",

She dodged the bullet. It would be wrong to describe anything associated with this wretched affair as a triumph, or even a victory, but it was a success of sorts because, in response to the killer question, she had an answer that exonerated her. Or at least seemed to. We need to learn more about her claim that it was the Labour home secretary in 2009 (Jacqui Smith or Alan Johnson) who took the decision to get rid of the Windrush landing cards, but for the purposes of PMQs, her answer was enough to derail Corbyn and let her off the hook. (May\u2019s comment about Albert Thompson now getting NHS treatment also needs further scrutiny, as Corbyn suggested.) Barristers supposedly operate on the basis that you should never ask a question to which you don\u2019t know the answer, and Corbyn did not seem to have prepared for what May told him about the landing cards. That said, he did not really let it throw him off his stride. He had another deadly question ready - the one about whether Amber Rudd, or May, was to blame for the institutional problems with the Home Office Rudd mentioned on Monday (and he should have asked it a second time, after May ignored it.) And his soundbite sound-off in question six was good. But it is hard to avoid the feeling that Labour MPs will view this as a missed opportunity. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-04-18T12:34:46.075Z\">at 1.34pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ad7283be4b0d4b06ccb4fde\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-04-18T11:18:31.399Z\">12.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Corbyn said May was to blame for sending \u2018go home\u201d vans around sending warnings to illegal immigrants.

          "bodyText": "Theresa May has suffered two big defeats in the House of Lords on her flagship Brexit legislation, the EU withdrawal bill, in a move that will embolden MPs who want to force her to keep the UK in the customs union. She lost by a majority of 123 on an amendment forcing ministers to explore the option of staying in the customs union and by a majority of 97 on an amendment limiting the ability of ministers to use secondary legislation to water down existing EU rights when those rights get transferred to UK law. (See 3.38pm.) The second defeat was largely technical, and the Brexit department implied the first one did not really matter because it would not stop the UK leaving the customs union anyway. (See 6.11pm.) But there are five more days of report stage debate in the House of Lords and tonight\u2019s voting figures suggest that Brexitsceptic peers in the Lords will turn out in large numbers to inflict several more defeats on the government, not all of which will easily be overturned in the Commons given the slenderness of the Tory/DUP majority. The votes will also encourage the pro-European Tories who are trying to win a Commons majority for future customs union amendments which would be more binding on the government. (See 6.40pm.) Theresa May is facing controversy over the case of Albert Thompson, a Londoner denied free NHS cancer treatment despite having lived in the UK for 44 years, after he disputed the prime minister\u2019s assertion to parliament that he would now receive the care he needed. The mother of a Windrush citizen who died suddenly last month after being classified as an illegal immigrant and sacked from his job believes the stress caused by his immigration problems was responsible for his death, the Guardian can reveal. Home Office claims that the destruction of Windrush-era landing cards in 2010 had no impact on the rights of those individuals to stay in the UK have been dramatically undermined by the evidence of two new whistleblowers. RT, the Kremlin-backed news channel that broadcasts in the UK, is facing seven new investigations after Ofcom said that it had seen a significant rise in potentially problematic material since the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripa. Jeremy Hunt received a \u201cbulk discount\u201d on seven flats bought from a Conservative donor, the Guardian can disclose, as parliament\u2019s watchdog opened an investigation into the health secretary\u2019s admission that he breached money laundering rules. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. Thanks for the comments. The Lords have now released the detailed voting figures for the second defeat. You can read them in detail here. There were 14 Conservative rebels this time. Labour have won the vote, by 314 votes to 217 - a majority of 97. Peers have voted for an amendment that would make it harder for ministers to weaken existing EU rights after Brexit. (See 3.38pm.) Ukip are not happy about the Lords vote. This is from the party leader, Gerard Batten. The vote by the House of Lords to remain in the customs union is a clear betrayal of the 17.4 million people who voted leave. Those people did not vote to be half in, half out of the EU. The Commons must reject the Kerr amendment or put itself in opposition to the people. Lord Kerr was the man who drafted article 50 in such a way that EU exit can be delayed, impeded and overturned. Acting true to form he is now trying to carry it through to its purpose. Ukip will continue to fight for a complete and clean exit from the EU. Actually, the vote wasn\u2019t a vote to remain in the customs union (see 6.11pm), but never mind ... Lady Hayter says the government amendments mentioned by Lord Callanan do not do what he says they will do. Some EU directives are not covered by the government\u2019s amendments. She says she has had three lawyers look at this, and all three told her that the government amendments were not robust enough. She says her amendment is better because it would ensure only primary legislation could be used to remove current EU rights in key areas. You can read the full text of the amendment here (pdf). It is amendment 11. Peers are now voting on the amendment. In the Lords Lord Callanan is responding on behalf of the government. He says the government has already tabled amendments to the bill that would stop the EU withdrawal bill being used to water down existing EU rights. Jeremy Corbyn is to meet New Zealand premier Jacinda Ardern - the emerging star of the international Left - for talks this weekend. The Labour leader will host Ardern after she returns from a retreat at Windsor Castle with her fellow Commonwealth heads of government. During the New Zealand election campaign last year, the 37-year-old politician was portrayed as the saviour of the beleaguered left in the wake of the Brexit vote and the election of Donald Trump. At the time Corbyn declared: \u201cDo it for all of us\u201d in a video of support. After an event on gender equality at City Hall today, Ardern told the Guardian that she planned to share how the New Zealand Labour party had managed a \u201creset\u201d at the 2007 election after many years in opposition. She said: We spent nine difficult years in opposition, we went through multiple leaders. We managed a reset at the last election. We spoke to the issues that I know New Zealand was concerned about: job security, decent health services, education, wages that weren\u2019t moving relative to the cost of living. However, asked what advice she could give Corbyn about pushing his party across the line to power, she said she would be \u201cvery wary\u201d about telling other political parties what to do, when hers had only been in power for less than a year. \u201cI\u2019m always happy to share about our experience but it would always be different to another nation\u2019s and another party\u2019s,\u201d she said. Lord Cormack, a Conservative peer seen as a loyalist, has just peers that he supports the amendment because he thinks it is consistent with Theresa May\u2019s pledge that the EU withdrawal bill should not be used to water down existing EU rights. Hugo Dixon, who set up the anti-Brexit InFacts, has posted a Twitter thread arguing that the Lords vote could lead to further, more significant defeats on Brexit. It starts here. In the Lords peers have just started debating the Labour amendment to the EU withdrawal bill on retained EU law, amendment 11. (See 3.38pm.) This is the second amendment due to be put to a vote tonight and, again, the government is expected to lose. Lady Hayter, a shadow Brexit minister, opened the debate. She said that Theresa May has promised not to dilute standards after Brexit and that this amendment would help to ensure that happened. Here is Anna Soubry, one of the most prominent pro-European Conservatives in the Commons, on the Lords vote. Soubry has tabled amendments to the trade bill and the taxation (cross-border trade) bill (sometimes referred to as the customs bill) which could lead to government defeats when they get debated later this spring. The two amendments, which so far have the backing of a handful of Tories, go further than Lord Kerr\u2019s amendment. But they do not specify that they UK will remain in the customs union under all circumstances. They say that staying in a customs union with the EU should be a negotiating \u201cobjective\u201d. This is from the Times\u2019 Henry Zeffman. The Brexit department (or DExEU to give it its proper name - the Department for Exiting the European Union) has issued a statement about the vote. A spokesman said: We are disappointed that parliament has voted for this amendment. The fundamental purpose of this bill is to prepare our statute book for exit day, it is not about the terms of our exit. This amendment does not commit the UK to remaining in a customs union with the EU, it requires us to make a statement in parliament explaining the steps we\u2019ve taken. Our policy on this subject is very clear. We are leaving the customs union and will establish a new and ambitious customs arrangement with the EU while forging new trade relationships with our partners around the world. The department is right about the wording. Here is the key passage from the amendment again. The condition in this subsection is that, by 31 October 2018, a Minister of the Crown has laid before both Houses of Parliament a statement outlining the steps taken in negotiations under Article 50(2) of the Treaty on European Union to negotiate, as part of the framework for the United Kingdom\u2019s future relationship with the European Union, an arrangement which enables the United Kingdom to continue participating in a customs union with the European Union. (Technically this is amendment 4. The vote was actually on amendment 1. But the two go together, and after amendment 1 was passed, amendment 4 went through on the nod, because there was no point voting on the same thing twice. The full list of amendments is here [pdf].) The amendment just says the government will have to give parliament a statement \u201coutlining the steps taken in negotiations ... to negotiate ... an arrangement which enables the United Kingdom to continue participating in a customs union with the European Union.\u201d That statement could be very short. In fact, it might just be the last two sentences of the press release. Here are the 24 Conservative peers who rebelled over the customs union. Lady Altmann Lord Arbuthnot of Edrom Lord Balfe Lord Bowness Lord Cooper of Windrush (Andrew Cooper, David Cameron\u2019s former strategy chief) Lord Cormack Lord Deben (aka John Gummer, the former party chairman) Lord Green of Hurstpierpoint Viscount Hailsham (aka Douglas Hogg, another former cabinet minister) Lord Heseltine (former deputy prime minister) Lord Horam Lord Inglewood Lord Kirkhope of Harrogate Lord Lansley (Andrew Lansley, the fomer health secretary) Lady McGregor-Smith Lady McIntosh of Pickering Lord Northbrook Lord Patten of Barnes (Chris Patten, former Tory chairman and former European commissioner) Lord Prior of Brampton Lord Tugendhat Lady Verma The Duke of Wellington Lady Wheatcroft (Patience Wheatcroft, the former Sunday Telegraph editor) Lord Willetts (David Willetts, the former universities minister) The House of Lords has its faults, but it is much better than the Commons at publishing the results of divisions. The results of the customs union vote are now up here. Here are the key figures. And here is some reaction to the vote from journalists. From my colleague Heather Stewart From Sky\u2019s Faisal Islam From the Economist\u2019s John Peet Here is some reaction to the vote. From Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary The passing of this cross-party amendment is an important step forward. Labour has long championed the benefits of a customs union as the only viable way to protect jobs, support manufacturing and help avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland after we leave the EU. That is why we have called on the government to negotiate a new comprehensive UK-EU customs union after Brexit as part of a close future relationship with the EU. Theresa May must now listen to the growing chorus of voices who are urging her to drop her redline on a customs union and rethink her approach. From Lord Newby, the Lib Dem leader in the Lords This is a hugely significant moment, the House of Lords has come together to show the government that remaining in a customs union is key to the UK\u2019s future prosperity. Securing this win on a cross-party basis rams home how out of touch the government have been on this issue and that they drastically need to change tack from the destructive hard Brexit they are pursuing. From Lord Adonis, the Labour peer and an outspoken opponent of Brexit The government has lost by a mile. Peers passed the Kerr amendment by 348 votes to 225 - a majority of 123. A spokesperson for Alex Salmond\u2019s TV production company, Sl\u00e0inte Media, has denied ever claiming the tweets on his RT chat show which Ofcom said were wrongly described as \u201caudience tweets\u201d were actually from viewers. (See 2.34pm.) Ofcom said earlier it had reached a preliminary decision in its investigation whether the Alex Salmond Show had broken \u201cdue accuracy\u201d rules by claiming to show tweets from viewers, and had decided those tweets he broadcast last November were not from audience members. Sl\u00e0inte Media said: Ofcom are still in the process of investigating a single complaint about \u2018viewers\u2019 tweets in the very first edition of The Alex Salmond show from last November. However, it has never been Slainte Media\u2019s contention that the tweets, emails or messages from the first show were from viewers or audience members of that first show given, by definition, the very first edition of a pre-recorded show (unlike every single Alex Salmond Show since that time) could not possibly present any messages or reaction from those viewers. This point is not in dispute. There have been no complaints about the content of any show since. Until Ofcom complete their procedures their rules prevent us from disclosing further details. However, that statement directly contradicts what Salmond said in that inaugural show, screened on 17 November, when he said to viewers \u201cyour tweets and emails\u201d would be read out. Within three minutes of the programme starting, Salmond stated: But first, to a really important part of the show, where I get to hear from you. Over the past week, and even before the show has started, we received an avalanche of tweets and emails. Can I just say to the media, thanks folks for all the publicity. Let\u2019s just look at a few of them \u2026 He first quoted a tweet from @ellalorenR asking \u201cso why RT?\u201d. One Twitter user said the day afterward they couldn\u2019t find any account of that name. No account of that name currently appears on Twitter. The fourth tweet he quoted from belonged to @lastjohn. That account then appeared to be from Luisa St John, listed in the show\u2019s credits and whose LinkedIn profile said she was series director of The Alex Salmond Show. That handle now belongs to a Twitter account set up in January 2018, which has not yet tweeted. This is from Sky\u2019s Faisal Islam. Peers are now voting. Lord Kerr is now winding up. Responding to what Lord Lawson, the former Tory chancellor and one-time Vote Leave chair, said in the debate, he says Lawson may well have said during the campaign that the UK was going to leave the customs union. But the nation was not listening. He says Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary and another Vote Leave campaigner, said that no one was talking about leaving the single market. Callanan says, if the government were to accept the amendment, it would send a signal to EU partners that it would not be serious about negotiating a new customs deal. He says he does not want peers to have \u201cfalse hope\u201d that they will back down on this point. Callanan is now summarising the government\u2019s two proposals for customs arrangements after Brexit - the new customs partnership, and the highly-streamlined customs arrangement. There are summarised in this DExEU paper (pdf). Lord Callanan, the Brexit minister, is now winding up for the government. He says the government takes amendments to the bill seriously. It wants to find consensus wherever possible. But it cannot accept these amendments, he says. He says a customs union has a single external order. That would mean trade policy being the authority of the EU. Hayter says this amendment is not about unscrambling Brexit. It is about how we leave the EU, she says. Lady Hayter is now winding up for Labour. She says the Kerr amendment gives the government the chance to reconsider its customs union red line. She says David Davis, the Brexit secretary, effectively admitted on election night that Theresa May\u2019s failure to win a majority meant the government did not have a mandate for taking the UK out of the customs union. She says Davis said that the election result would show whether the government had a mandate for this. In the Lords the backbench speeches are coming to an end. As the Press Association reports, Chris Patten, the Conservative former cabinet minister used his speech to mock claims by the international trade secretary Liam Fox that a free trade deal with the EU would be \u201cone of the easiest in human history\u201d. He suggested the current approach being taken by the government to securing agreements was \u201cabsurd\u201d. He also said the idea that countries such as Australia would open up their market without any demands in return was \u201cnonsense\u201d. In a sideswipe at the foreign secretary Boris Jonson, Patten said: I don\u2019t think repeating the Road to Mandalay whenever one\u2019s travelling, I don\u2019t think that is going to make a spectacular difference to our trading opportunities. I don\u2019t think we will do better than we are doing within the customs union. Sky\u2019s Faisal Islam has some more highlights. These are from the BBC\u2019s Esther Webber In the Scottish parliament Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, told MSPs that attempts to resolve the dispute between the UK, Scottish and Welsh governments over the EU withdrawal bill were \u201creaching the end game\u201d. Giving evidence to Holyrood\u2019s committee conveners (Holyrood\u2019s equivalent of the Commons liaison committee), Sturgeon said the UK government\u2019s decision to challenge the Scottish government\u2019s own Brexit legislation in the Supreme Court was \u201cdeeply regrettable\u201d. She explained: The Westminster government had a decision to make, whether to respect the decision the Scottish Parliament arrived at or not to respect it, and unfortunately they opted not to and referred to the supreme court ... I think it\u2019s fair to say we are reaching the end game of this. We know the stage the withdrawal bill is at in terms of being at the report stage in the Lords, so we will probably over the next couple of weeks need to see this come to an agreement or not. We are talking now more like days rather than weeks. I genuinely hope we can reach agreement but inevitably when there is pretty fundamental issues of principles involved, the bar for agreement is not always easy to overcome. The dispute between the UK, Scottish and Welsh government is about what happens to EU powers being repatriated that related to policy areas that are devolved. It is accepted that most should be devolved but that some should be retained (so that the UK government can maintain common rules for the UK single market), but there is a dispute over how much say Scotland and Wales over the UK-retained elements. Amber Rudd, the home secretary, has been summoned to the Commons home affairs committee to give evidence to it next week about the Windrush generation, the BBC reports. The SNP has been accused of manufacturing a legal row over Brexit in order to push for a second independence referendum. As the Press Association reports, the accusation came as MPs debated the UK government\u2019s decision to challenge emergency Brexit legislation passed by the Scottish parliament and Welsh assembly in the courts. Scottish Tory MP Kirstene Hair described the move as a \u201cpolitical manoeuvre\u201d designed to instigate another referendum. Hair, speaking the Commons, said: Myself and my colleagues have been concerned that the SNP\u2019s continuity Bill is a political manoeuvre designed to create precedence for legislation on a second independence referendum. It\u2019s time for the SNP to put this grievance to one side and get serious about working together as one team for the best possible Brexit. SNP frontbencher Pete Wishart told ministers the decision to challenge the bill represented an \u201cutter contempt\u201d for Scottish parliament. He said: This quite extraordinary, there\u2019s only a question about this legislation because the Tories have chosen to question it. They\u2019ve been democratically defeated in the Scottish parliament by an overwhelming majority and they\u2019re now showing their utter contempt for Scottish democracy by seeking to have this democratic decision overturned in the courts. Turning back to Albert Thompson for a moment, this is from my colleague Peter Walker. And this is from the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg. The government is preparing a climbdown over its key Brexit bill in the House of Lords over EU rules on clinical trials, as it braces itself for a series of defeats, my colleague Heather Stewart reports. Ministers are expected to accept the substance of an amendment tabled by crossbench peer Lord Patel, which would keep EU clinical trial regulations \u2013 which have not yet come into force \u2013 in UK law. Here is Heather\u2019s story. It is not unusual for ministers to offer concessions in the House of Lords but it was not until I read Legislation at Westminster, a revealing book - academic, but readable - by Meg Russell and Daniel Gover about how laws get passed, that I discovered ministers have to prepare a \u201cconcession strategy\u201d for all bills before they are allowed to bring them to parliament. And the Lords is often where this strategy gets rolled out. Russell and Gover write: One government official suggested that the \u2018golden rule is don\u2019t amend in committee, save it for report\u2019. Likewise, \u2018if you can wait for the Lords, then wait for the Lords\u2019; in short \u2018don\u2019t amend until you have to amend\u2019. Another official suggested that \u2018the culture of the Commons is one in which any minor concession would be trumpeted as a major climbdown or humiliating U-turn, and I just don\u2019t think that the rhetoric that is used is the same in the Lords\u2019. As Kerr pointed out a moment ago, his amendment would not guarantee that the UK would remain in the customs union. It just says the government should have to explain to parliament what it has done to negotiate \u201can arrangement which enables the United Kingdom to continue participating in a customs union with the European Union.\u201d (See 3.38pm.) On my reading of the amendment, the government could comply with it by coming back to parliament and giving the answer as - nothing. In an Independent article today Joe Watts says that, for this reason, the government could \u201clive with\u201d a defeat on the Kerr amendment. Watts quotes an unnamed cabinet minister as saying: The language of this amendment is not strictly prescriptive and if, in this instance, it passes, I think we can probably live with it. Kerr says his amendment would require the government to negotiate for a customs union, and make a statement to parliament before the withdrawal agreement gets put to a vote. He says he cannot require the government to secure a customs union deal. The EU may not accept this, he says. He says that is why is amendment is phrased in the way it is. Kerr says the EU are preparing to offer the UK a \u201cbarebones\u201d free trade deal, with little on services. That is because the UK is committed to leaving the customs union. But the EU guidelines also say that, if the UK were to drop this condition, the EU may revise its offer. He says that is why the government should accept his amendment. His amendment would allow the government to explore what might be available if the UK were to stay in the customs union. Without that, the UK will never know what is on offer, he says. He says the subject of the customs union did not come up in the EU referendum. The country voted narrowly to leave the European Union, but no one can argue that it voted knowingly to leave the customs union with the European Union. But Theresa May made it a red line in her speech to the Conservative party conference in 2016. He says he does not know what discussions there were in government about the economic implications of this. Other red lines have been blurred, he says. He says he is not in favour of leaving. But if the UK must leave, it should do so in such a way as to limit the damage, he says. If in the end we do leave it should be in a way that limits the damage to the country\u2019s well being and the future of our children. Lord Kerr is opening the debate. He says his amendment (see 3.38pm) is a call to the government to \u201cexplore\u201d a customs union. Business wants a customs union, he says. He says, over time, leaving the customs union could cost the country 1% of GDP. Peers are now starting a debate on the EU withdrawal bill, the flagship legislation that will transfer EU law into UK law ahead of Brexit so that there is legal continuity at the point the UK leaves the EU. (Later the laws will diverge, but not on day one.) There is nothing in itself new about that. Peers have already spend 13 days debating it this year, at second reading and committee stage, with minimal interest from the media. But now they are onto the report stage, the bit where they start voting, and it is going to get newsy. You can read all the amendments here (pdf). This afternoon peers will be debating the customs union and retained EU law and, with the government lacking a majority, the government is expected to be defeated on both issues. Customs union The key amendment has been tabled by Lord Kerr, the crossbencher and former head of the Foreign Office credited with drafting article 50, Lord Patten, the former Conservative chairman and European commissioner, Lady Hayter, a shadow Brexit minister, and Lady Ludford, a Lib Dem Brexit spokeswoman. It would require the government, as part of the Brexit process, to make a statement to parliament \u201coutlining the steps taken in negotiations under Article 50(2) of the Treaty on European Union to negotiate, as part of the framework for the United Kingdom\u2019s future relationship with the European Union, an arrangement which enables the United Kingdom to continue participating in a customs union with the European Union.\u201d Retained EU law This is a Labour amendment also signed by a Lib Dem peer, Lady Smith of Newnham, and a Conservative, Lord Kirkhope. It says that, after Brexit, ministers should not be allowed to amend retained EU law in certain areas except by primary legislation, or subordinate legislation subject to certain beefed-up scrutiny requirements. The areas affected are: (a) employment entitlements, rights and protection, (b) equality entitlements, rights and protection, (c) health and safety entitlements, rights and protection, (d) consumer standards, or (e) environmental standards and protection, Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, is being investigated by Kathryn Stone, the parliamentary commissioner for standards, her office has confirmed. The allegation is that he failed to declare his interest in a property company. PoliticsHome broke the story. We knew that a complaint had been submitted to the commissioner, but that does not automatically trigger an investigation because some complaints get dismissed as without merit. This one, though, is serious enough to merit a proper inquiry. This is from PoliticsHome\u2019s Emilio Casalicchio. Various people (including George Eaton in his New Statesman PMQs review) have been making the point that, after being ambushed by Theresa May\u2019s Windrush landing cards reply at PMQs, Jeremy Corbyn should have made the point that, even if the decision to destroy the cards was taken in 2009, it was policy decisions taken by May that made the loss of the cards so calamitous. Now the Labour party is saying that too. It has just put out this statement from a spokesperson. The government\u2019s story is shifting by the hour. First Downing Street claimed the decision to destroy the Windrush-era landing cards was made by the Home Office in 2010 for data protection reasons. Then the Home Office passed the buck to a 2010 decision by the UK Border Agency. At PMQs, the prime minister tried to shift the blame onto the last Labour government but was undermined by her own spokesperson minutes later, who then stated it was an operational decision, which Labour ministers would not have been aware of. Her spokesperson couldn\u2019t even say when the cards were destroyed. In the confusion, one thing is already clear: The change in the law in 2014 that meant members of the Windrush generation faced deportation and the loss of their rights, including to healthcare, was made in full view of the fact that the vital information had been destroyed. The home secretary at the time must be held to account for the disastrous impact her \u201chostile environment\u201d policies have had on the lives of British citizens. UPDATE: The Labour press statement does not point out that the Labour party did not oppose the 2014 Immigration Act that has exacerbated the problems of the Windrush-generation immigrants. But, as William Richardson at Evolve Politics reports, six Labour MPs did vote against it. One of them was Jeremy Corybn. The broadcasting regulator Ofcom has disclosed it believes that messages broadcast as \u201caudience tweets\u201d during Alex Salmond\u2019s controversial chatshow on the Kremlin-funded channel RT were fake. In two footnotes to its statement today that it has launched seven new investigations into RT\u2019s coverage after the Salisbury nerve agent attack, Ofcom says it had already started other inquiries into the Russian broadcaster\u2019s output. It said one dated to December 2017, when it announced it would look into suspicious tweets screened on Salmond\u2019s show on 16 November, which included interviews with the ousted Catalan president, Carles Puigdemont, the Tory MP Crispin Blunt and the Labour peer Helena Kennedy. Ofcom states: We already had one open investigation relating to \u2018audience tweets\u2019 in the Alex Salmond Show, which we have provisionally found were not from audience members. One of the suspicious tweets appeared to be from the series director of Salmond\u2019s programme producers, Luisa St John. Ben Nimmo, an expert in Russian propaganda with the Atlantic Council\u2019s digital forensic research lab and a former Nato press officer, said the number of new cases was very significant, although it remained to be seen whether all seven would be proven. He said: Ofcom has found 10 RT programmes guilty of violating accuracy and impartiality standards over the past four years. Now, in one go, it says it\u2019s seen seven programmes which \u2018warrant investigation\u2019 since March 4. Even by RT\u2019s standards, that\u2019s a major increase. The mention of the Alex Salmond Show adds to RT\u2019s problems. Ofcom confirmed that they\u2019ve provisionally found that so-called \u2018audience tweets\u2019 presented by the show were not sent by audience members. That investigation was launched in December, so it\u2019s not related to Salisbury, but it doesn\u2019t do anything to enhance RT\u2019s reputation. Jacqui Smith, the Labour home secretary until June 2009, thinks she deserves an apology from Theresa May. At PMQs May implied that either Smith or Alan Johnson, home secretary for the rest of 2009, was to blame for the decision to destroy the Windrush landing cards. Downing Street says the decision to destroy the landing cards was an operational one taken by the Border Force, not one taken by the home secretary. (See 1.12pm.) Some readers have been in touch to argue this shows May was lying. But May did not actually say that Smith or Johnson took the decision. She implied it, but she did not say it. Her actual words were: [Corbyn] asked me if the decision to destroy the landing cards - the decision to destroy the landing cards - had been taken in my time as home secretary. The decision to destroy the landing cards was taken in 2009 and as I seem to recall in 2009 it was a Labour Home Secretary who was in office. This is misleading, because MPs were left with the impression that the decision was taken by the home secretary. But, in the annals of political dishonesty, this is very much at the vanilla end of things. Ministers are ultimately responsible for what their officials do, even if they do not take the decisions themselves. And nowhere is this more true than in the Home Office. The former home secretary Jack Straw once summed it up like this. One of my predecessors, who was in one of the Thatcher cabinets, said to me, \u2018What you have to understand about being home secretary, Jack, is that at any one time there\u2019ll be 50 sets of officials working on projects which will undermine the government and destroy your political career. And the worst is, not only do you not know who they are, they don\u2019t know either. CORRECTION: Earlier, in the PMQs write-up at 12.44pm, I said the Conservative MP Steve Double spoke about the Labour candidate in the Gower spreading lies about Byron Davies, the Tory MP defeated in the 2017 election. But Double actually referred to a Labour activist being responsible - not the Labour party candidate. I\u2019ve corrected the post. I am sorry for the mistake. There are more details about the case here. Here is a Guardian video from last month featuring Albert Thompson explaining how he had been told that he was facing a \u00a354,000 bill for cancer treatment. This is what political journalists and commentators are saying about PMQs. Generally, it is seen as a decisive win for Theresa May. From Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby From the Daily Mirror\u2019s Jason Beattie From the Guardian\u2019s Gaby Hinsliff From the Financial Times\u2019 Sebastian Payne From the Sunday Times\u2019 Tim Shipman From ITV\u2019s Daniel Hewitt From the New Statesman\u2019s Stephen Bush From the Times\u2019 Matt Chorley From the Yorkshire Post\u2019s Arj Singh From the Times\u2019 Patrick Kidd From PoliticsHome\u2019s Kevin Schofield From the Mail on Sunday\u2019s Dan Hodges From the Evening Standard editor (and former Tory chancellor) George Osborne More on the landing cards issue. This is from HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh, who was at the post-PMQs No 10 briefing. And this is from Sky\u2019s Faisal Islam. This is from the BBC\u2019s Jason Keen. (On a related point, I think Monday\u2019s blog was the first I\u2019ve written since the EU referendum that did not include the word Brexit once.) This is from my colleague Peter Walker. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, asked about the \u201crape clause\u201d in his questions. He asked May if she agreed with Esther McVey, the work and pensions secretary, that government plans on this topic offered women \u201cdouble support\u201d. He said the \u201crape clause\u201d was a disgrace and asked: \u201cWhat kind of society do we live in?\u201d May said the government was taking \u201cevery care\u201d to make sure the issue was dealt with sensitively. I\u2019ve taken the quotes from PoliticsHome. PMQs is over. Someone attempts to raise a point of order (see 12.31pm), but John Bercow, the speaker, says points of order come later. There is an urgent question on equal pay first. Labour\u2019s Stella Creasy asks about a constituency case involving a suspect who is in India. The Indians are not cooperating, she says. May says it is important to recognise the independence of the judiciaries in both countries. Pauline Latham, a Conservative, asks May if she will discuss with the Canadian prime minister how the G7 can work to fight malaria. May says she has not met Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, yet this week. Steve Double, a Conservative, says a Labour activist in the Gower spread lies about Byron Davies, the Tory who was defeated. May says Davies has received an apology. But parties should not just talk about free and fair elections. They should put that into practice. UPDATE: Originally I said Double spoke about the Labour candidate in the Gower spreading lies about Byron Davies. But Double actually referred to a Labour activist being responsible - not the Labour party candidate. I\u2019ve corrected the post. I am sorry for the mistake. The DUP\u2019s Nigel Dodds asks May for an assurance that social media companies will be forced to tackle the problem of abuse and to end the \u201cWild West culture\u201d they encourage. May says the government is working with social media companies on this. They are not publishers. But they are not just platforms either. Bob Blackman, a Conservative, asks May to condemn the mobile billboards going round London attacking Narendra Modi, the Indian prime minister. May says the Indian community make an enormous contribution. She spoke to Prime Minister Modi today about how to increase the links between the two countries. Nigel Evans, a Conservative, asks what message May has for Commonwealth leaders and people in the Commonwealth about gay rights. May says she address this when speaking to the Commonwealth forum yesterday. Many Commonwealth countries have anti-gay laws, but many of those laws were put in place by Britain. Britain will back any country that wants to repeal them, she says. Plaid Cymru\u2019s Ben Lake asks about the lifeboat in Ceredigion Bay. Does May agree the lifeboat service should continue in the bay? May says a number of services provide rescue services. But the RNLI plays an important role, she says. It is independent; it decides where it allocates resources. Anne Main, a Conservative, asks about a tech investment in her constituency. May gives her support to the company. Labour\u2019s Virendra Sharma asks May if the government will continue to support the fight against TB. May says the government wants to follow the example India is setting on this issue. Labour\u2019s Afzal Khan asks about Kashmir. May says the government continues to take the view that the best solution is for India and Pakistan to come together to resolve this issue. Iain Duncan Smith, a Conservative, asks May if she agrees that all parties should kick out antisemites and apologists for antisemites. May says she agrees. It is very important for parties show a clear signal that antisemitism will not be tolerated. She pays tribute to the Labour MPs who spoke out in last night\u2019s debate about the antisemitic abuse they had suffered. That was a fine example of what parliament is for, she says. May says there is no causal relationship between crime and the number of police officers. Those are not her words, she says. They are the words of the shadow policing minister. PMQs - Snap verdict: May prevailed. She dodged the bullet. It would be wrong to describe anything associated with this wretched affair as a triumph, or even a victory, but it was a success of sorts because, in response to the killer question, she had an answer that exonerated her. Or at least seemed to. We need to learn more about her claim that it was the Labour home secretary in 2009 (Jacqui Smith or Alan Johnson) who took the decision to get rid of the Windrush landing cards, but for the purposes of PMQs, her answer was enough to derail Corbyn and let her off the hook. (May\u2019s comment about Albert Thompson now getting NHS treatment also needs further scrutiny, as Corbyn suggested.) Barristers supposedly operate on the basis that you should never ask a question to which you don\u2019t know the answer, and Corbyn did not seem to have prepared for what May told him about the landing cards. That said, he did not really let it throw him off his stride. He had another deadly question ready - the one about whether Amber Rudd, or May, was to blame for the institutional problems with the Home Office Rudd mentioned on Monday (and he should have asked it a second time, after May ignored it.) And his soundbite sound-off in question six was good. But it is hard to avoid the feeling that Labour MPs will view this as a missed opportunity. Corbyn said May was to blame for sending \u2018go home\u201d vans around sending warnings to illegal immigrants. On Monday Rudd said she did not know if anyone had been deported. How many people have been deported. May says some people may have wrongly been sent letters saying they should not be her. The government has apologised. But there is a difference between the Windrush generation, who are here legally, and those who are not here legally. People have a right to know that services only go to people who should get them. Corbyn says he has been told that Thompson has not been told he will be getting treatment. He says May\u2019s pandering to people over immigration led to May creating a hostile environment. Vital documents were shredded. The Windrush generation came here to help rebuild Britian. Under May the Home Office was heartless and hopeless. And under her the government is callous and incompetent. May says the government is helping the Windrush generation. She says Corbyn talks about being callous. But she initiated the race disparity audit. She asks what can be done to ensure there are equal opportunities in this country. Corbyn accuses her of being callous. She will not take that in the light of what was said in last night\u2019s debate about antisemitism, and she will not take it from a man who allows antisemitism to exist in his party. Corbyn says it was May\u2019s government that tried to create a hostile environment for immigrants. May should not blame officials, he says. May says Corbyn asked about the decision to destroy the landing cards was taken in 2009, under a Labour home secretary. Corbyn says the decision was implemented under a Tory government. On Monday Amber Rudd said the Home Office was too concerned with policy. Who is to blame? Rudd or her predecessor? May says Rudd has been swift in responding to this issue. Corbyn asked about action taken to deal with illegal immigration. It is right that action is taken against people here illegally. But the Windrush generation are here legally. If Corbyn wants to question what is being done about illegal immigration, he should question Yvette Cooper, the former shadow home secretary, who said in 2013 tougher action was needed to deal with illegal immigration. UPDATE: This is what May actually in her reply to Corbyn (in her third reply, or her first reply in this block.) [Corbyn] asked me if the decision to destroy the landing cards - the decision to destory the landing cards - had been taken in my time as home secretary. The decision to destroy the landing cards was taken in 2009 and as I seem to recall in 2009 it was a Labour home secretary who was in office. In my original write-up, I said \u201cMay says Corbyn asked about the decision to destroy the landing cards was taken in 2009, by a Labour home secretary.\u201d That was my mistake, as I was trying to summarise her point. I have corrected it, so it now reads \u201cunder\u201d a Labour home secretary. Jeremy Corbyn says last month he raised the case of Albert Thompson, who has lived her for decades but has been denied NHS treatment. May brushed it off. Will she now say he will get the cancer treatement he needs? May says it was not brushed off. No urgent treatment should be withheld from people, she says. She says Thompson is not part of the Windrush generation. But clinicians have been looking at his case, and he will get the treatment he needs. May says Albert Thompson will get the cancer treatment he needs. Corbyn asks if May took the decision to destroy the landing cards of Windrush immigrants. No, says May. The decision was taken in 2009 under a Labour government. May claims decision to destroy Windrush landing cards taken by Labour, not her. Neil O\u2019Brien, a Conservative, asks for an update on the Windrush generation. May says this has caused a great deal of concern. She says people who came here from the Commonwealth countries have made a massive contribution. These people are British. They are part of us. There is no intention of making them leave, she says. She says she wants to say sorry and apologise to those who have \u201cmistakenly\u201d received letters. May restates her apology to those Windrush-generation migrants who, she says, have \u201cmistakenly\u201d received letters. She says the government is working hard to help those who do not have the documents they need. Theresa May says this week the UK is hosting the Commonwealth heads of government meeting. She says MPs will want to join her in welcoming leaders from 52 countries to London, who collectively represent a third of the world\u2019s population. The summit will focus particularly on how to revitalise the institution. My colleague Dan Sabbagh thinks Jeremy Corbyn has an easy task today. PMQs is about to start. Here is the running order. On the Daily Politics Ian Lavery, the Labour party chair, has just told Andrew Neil that he thinks around 100 Labour party members are being investigated for antisemitism. Asked about the complaints about Ken Livingstone, who is suspended in relation to comments seen as antisemitic pending a final decision, Lavery said that the case should have been resolved more quickly and that he hoped it would be resolved soon. Theresa May met the Indian prime minister Narendra Modi in Downing Street this morning. According to Number 10, Anglo-Indian trade deals worth \u00a31bn have been agreed today. And they discussed Brexit. Here is an extract from the Number 10 readout. The prime minister updated Prime Minister Modi on the progress of the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU, saying the implementation period agreed in March gives Indian companies and investors the confidence that market access will continue on current terms until the end of 2020. She reiterated that the UK will remain committed to global free trade and investment and that the UK will remain a leading hub for global finance. Prime Minister Modi said there would be no dilution in the importance of the UK to India post-Brexit. He said the City of London was of great importance to India for accessing the global markets and would remain so. The two leaders said trade between the UK and India had grown strongly over the last year and Prime Minister Modisaid that Brexit offers opportunities to further increase trade ties. Here is the Ofcom statement in full. Ofcom has today opened seven new investigations into the due impartiality of news and current affairs programmes on the RT news channel. The investigations form part of an Ofcom update, published today, into the licences held by TV Novosti, the company that broadcasts RT. Until recently, TV Novosti\u2019s overall compliance record has not been materially out of line with other broadcasters. However, since the events in Salisbury, we have observed a significant increase in the number of programmes on the RT service that warrant investigation as potential breaches of the Ofcom Broadcasting Code. We will announce the outcome of these investigations as soon as possible. In relation to our fit and proper duty, we will consider all relevant new evidence, including the outcome of these investigations and the future conduct of the licensee. Ofcom is announcing seven investigations into RT (formally Russia Today), Sky reports. Ann Taylor, the former Labour MP and committee chair, goes next. Q: What would happen if the resolution was amended to require a second vote? Baker says this would be very controversial. The public have decided, he says. He says people do not want to be asked again. Parliament needs to respect that democratic decision, he says. It needs to show people that, when they voted in 2016, that had meaning. There must not be attempts to stay in via the back door or to reverse the decision. He says parliament backed triggering article 50 by a large majority. Q: But what would happen if it were carried? Baker says the government would look at it carefully. But the government will ask parliament to approve the withdrawal agreement and the future partnership proposal as a package. And that\u2019s it. The hearing is over. Q: Will the WAI bill need legislative consent from the Scottish parliament and the Welsh assembly? Braverman says the government will be seeking approval from Scotland and Wales and, if it is relevant, legislative consent will be sought. Q: What is the government\u2019s view of the emergency legislation passed by the Scottish parliament and the Welsh assembly? Braverman says there is a legal challenge to the Scottish legislation. She cannot comment on it, she says. Turning away from the committee for a moment, Home Office claims that the destruction of Windrush-era landing cards in 2010 had no impact on the rights of those individuals to stay in the UK have been dramatically undermined by the evidence of two new whistleblowers, my colleague Amelia Gentleman reports. Braverman says the government intends to bring forward the withdrawal agreement and implementation (WAI) bill very soon after the \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d. Q: What is the scope for substantive amendments to the withdrawal agreement and implementation (WAI) bill? Suella Braverman (until recently Fernandes - she has just go married), another Brexit minister giving evidence alongside Baker, says it would be surprising if parliament wanted to pass amendments that went against what was agreed in the resolution. Baker says he thinks the government can pass the legislation needed before Brexit in time. But that is subject to the will of parliament. He says the government and parliament will need to work constructively together. But if the resolution backing the withdrawal deal is passed, then they should work constructively together, he says. Q: Will the resolution put to both Houses by amendable? Baker says resolutions can be amended, but that is not what the government wants. Q: But what happens if it is amended? Baker says the government hopes that will not happen. Lord Judge, a crossbencher, asks what would happen if the Commons approves the withdrawal agreement but the Lords rejects it. Baker says the government expects the Lords to follow the will of the elected House. Q: But what happens if it does not? Baker says the government expects to put forward an agreement both Houses will support. He says he would be interested to know what the Lords think should happen in those circumstances. Q: But what would happen? There would be a flurry of conversations, he says. But he says, under the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act, the treaty would still be ratified if the Commons approved it, but the Lords does not. Baker says House of Lords on its own would not be able to block Brexit withdrawal deal. Steve Baker, the Brexit minister, opens. He says it is not possible to say when the \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d will happen, but the government wants it to happen as soon as possible after the withdrawal agreement is agreed, which should be in October. The Lords constitution committee hearing is starting now. According to the committee, here are some of the questions they want to address. Is the \u2018meaningful vote\u2019 a choice between accepting the withdrawal agreement in full or leaving the European Union without a deal? How does the government envisage parliament\u2019s scrutiny of the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration on the framework of the future relationship? How long do you expect parliamentarians and committees will have to examine the agreement and the political declaration before the \u2018meaningful vote\u2019 is held? The government has indicated that the motion will cover both the withdrawal agreement and political declaration on the framework of the future relationship. Will it be possible for parliament to approve one and not the other? What consequences would that have? Will the government publish a full analysis of the impact of the withdrawal agreement as part of the explanatory materials accompanying the withdrawal agreement and implementation bill? Will the withdrawal agreement and implementation bill need legislative consent from the devolved legislatures? Good morning. And sorry for the the late start. I was held up for various domestic reasons. As my colleague Jessica Elgot reports, Amber Rudd, the home secretary, is facing further pressure over the treatment of Windrush-era migrants, with Labour now effectively calling for her resignation. (That\u2019s what \u201cconsider her position\u201d means - Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, is not saying Rudd should consider her position and decide to stay.) This is bound to come up at PMQs. Otherwise it is almost wall-to-wall Brexit, with peers voting on the EU withdrawal bill this afternoon and this evening, and a potentially interesting committee hearing about to start. Here is the agenda for the day. 10am: Penny Mordaunt, the international development secretary, and the Microsoft founder Bill Gates speak at a malaria summit in London. 10.30am: The Brexit ministers Steve Baker and Suella Braverman (n\u00e9e Fernandes - she got married last month) give evidence to the Lords constitution committee about the promise of a \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d on the Brexit withdrawal treaty. 12pm: Theresa May faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs. 2pm: Michael Gove, the environment secretary, gives evidence to the Commons environmental audit committee about his 25-year environment plan. 2.30pm: Prof Alan Manning, chair of the migration advisory committee, gives evidence to the Commons home affairs committee about the impact of EU nationals on the labour market. After 3.30pm: Peers begin the report stage debate for the EU withdrawal bill. It is at this point that peers start voting and the government is expected to be defeated on a customs union amendment. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I will post a summary at the end of the day. You can read all today\u2019s Guardian politics stories here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news from Jack Blanchard. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019 top 10 must reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but normally I find it impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer direct questions, although sometimes I miss them or don\u2019t have time. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

As the push for this pipeline has transfixed the country, there\u2019s one image the oil industry and Canadian government desperately want to avoid: that of Indigenous peoples as the unifying front of a rising movement for an alternative.</p> <p>The media has thus far done them the favour. We\u2019ve heard little about the Tsleil-Waututh and Squamish, the coastal First Nations who\u2019ve <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/trans-mountain-kinder-morgan-court-first-nations-1.4316928\">taken</a> the federal government to court. We\u2019ve heard even less about the Secwepemc in the interior of BC \u2013 whose lands cover almost half of Kinder Morgan\u2019s route \u2013 who are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/true-north/2017/oct/16/indigenous-rights-serious-obstacle-to-kinder-morgan-pipeline-report-says\">building solar-panelled tiny houses</a> directly in the pipeline\u2019s path. And we\u2019ve heard nothing about the Lubicon, Athabasca Chipewyan and Beaver Lake Cree downstream of the Alberta mines, who first raised the cry of concern about Canada\u2019s future with the tar sands. </p> <p>They understand what the Alberta and Canadian governments seem to not. To prevent climate breakdown, we must stop oil companies from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jan/07/much-worlds-fossil-fuel-reserve-must-stay-buried-prevent-climate-change-study-says\">digging up new deposits</a> of fossil fuels. Government boosters of each pipeline project have instead sent a very clear message: to hell with our climate commitments. So Indigenous peoples have done what our governments will not: they\u2019ve drawn a line.</p> <p>At a <a href=\"http://www.vueweekly.com/everyones_downstream_ii_tar_sands_usa/\">meeting</a> in Alberta ten years ago, long before the world knew of the tar sands, a young Indigenous activist named Clayton Thomas-Mueller pointed at a map of proposed pipelines, sprawling like tentacles across North America. \u201cThis map traces where our allies will emerge,\u201d he predicted.</p> <p>And so we\u2019ve seen new, diverse coalitions of Indigenous and non-Indigenous people spring forth in the pathway of the Northern Gateway, Keystone XL, and Energy East pipelines. Each has been stalled or halted. Kinder Morgan\u2019s TransMountain expansion \u2013 tripling its carrying capacity \u2013 is the latest. The thousands who\u2019ve flocked to Burnaby mountain the last weeks now know that real climate leaders aren\u2019t found in legislatures. They\u2019re found mounting blockades on the ground.</p> <p>The rule of law, you say? By pushing through the pipeline, Justin Trudeau bulldozes it himself. He violates Indigenous land rights on unceded lands that have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/true-north/2014/oct/21/the-indigenous-land-rights-ruling-that-could-transform-canada\">recognized</a> by the Supreme Court, and the right to \u201cfree, prior informed consent\u201d in the United Nations declaration. He violates the Paris Climate Accords, whose ambitious target his government was praised for helping establish. And he violates an electoral mandate granted by a majority of British Columbians. In other words, the Indigenous-led opposition to pipelines aren\u2019t \u201crogue criminals\u201d or a \u201cnoisy minority.\u201d They\u2019re enforcing the democratic will of a province \u2013 and the sacred legal duties of the country.</p> <p>So don\u2019t let pundits and politicians pretend this crisis is about BC Premier John Horgan defying federal jurisdiction. Governments aren\u2019t provoking a new constitutional impasse. They\u2019re prolonging an old colonial pillage. Much of the remaining pools of global carbon \u2013 and the infrastructure to ship it out \u2013 are located on Indigenous peoples\u2019 territories. Which makes the attempt to trample through their lands by a foreign oil company \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.desmog.ca/2018/04/12/kinder-morgan-blackmailing-canada-and-government-letting-it-happen\">a spawn of Enron</a> \u2013 part of a long, familiar story. Yet Justin Trudeau doesn\u2019t call this what it is. He calls it the \u201cnational interest.\u201d</p> <p>But wrapping a crime in the flag of national interest can only shroud the truth for so long. The wall of Indigenous-led protest points the way to a new story: a transition off fossil fuels to a thriving low-carbon economy. The world is already <a href=\"https://thetyee.ca/Opinion/2018/02/15/Why-Oilsands-Era-Is-Over/\">turning</a> on the tar sands. Its shadow may tower over Canadian politics, but its contribution is diminishing and small: just 2 percent of our economy. </p> <p>The good news is that we can create far more jobs through investment in a clean energy transition than in oil and gas \u2013 as <a href=\"https://www.policyalternatives.ca/sites/default/files/uploads/publications/BC%20Office/2012/03/CCPA-BC_Enbridge_Pipe_Dreams_2012.pdf\">many as 34 times</a> more. Such as in public transit, housing retrofits and health or care-giving work. Or by <a href=\"http://www.lubiconsolar.ca/\">funding</a> Indigenous-owned renewable projects that communities are already getting off the ground. So why are Trudeau and Alberta premier Rachel Notley spending our taxes bailing out a Texas oil billionaire? They should be bailing out Canada\u2019s workers, First Nations and the climate.</p> <p>To say that Indigenous peoples have become the heroes in this fight isn\u2019t high-minded romanticism. It\u2019s hard-bitten reality. Those First Nations who\u2019ve signed deals with Kinder Morgan struggle with crushing poverty \u2013 they are stuck between a pipeline and a hard place. And as Indigenous rights have become more formidable, the financials buy-offs \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/true-north/2016/mar/20/by-rejecting-1-billion-for-a-pipeline-a-first-nation-has-put-justin-trudeaus-climate-plan-on-trial\">as much as $1bn per fossil fuel project</a> \u2013 have only grown larger. This suggests one thing about the resistance of other First Nations: that it is even more remarkable.</p> <p>\u201cWe need the money [the project would bring], but we don\u2019t need it enough to sell out the things we love and are spiritually connected to \u2013 and that\u2019s our land, our water, our people,\u201d Rueben George of the Tsleil-Waututh First Nation <a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-what-if-the-trans-mountain-pipeline-is-never-built/\">said</a> on Friday. </p> <p>The Tsleil-Waututh, and their many growing supporters, will be on watch when Kinder Morgan takes its likely next step: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/wildernesscommittee/posts/10155526016567993\">drilling</a> a hole through Burnaby mountain. Polls <a href=\"http://www.vancourier.com/news/1-in-4-pipeline-opponents-would-consider-civil-disobedience-poll-1.23178843\">show</a> that 10 percent of British Columbians \u2013 an astonishing half-a-million people \u2013 are already prepared to engage in civil disobedience to stop it. They understand what government and industry hoped they would not: that Indigenous rights aren\u2019t just a tool to forge a safe, liveable future \u2013 they\u2019re the most powerful one we have.</p> <p>It means the best representative of our national interest isn\u2019t Justin Trudeau or Rachel Notley, nor even John Horgan. It\u2019s the Indigenous peoples standing in the path of a pipeline. </p> <p><em>Twitter</em>: <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/Martin_Lukacs\">@Martin_Lukacs</a><br></p>",

We\u2019ve heard even less about the Secwepemc in the interior of BC \u2013 whose lands cover almost half of Kinder Morgan\u2019s route \u2013 who are building solar-panelled tiny houses directly in the pipeline\u2019s path. And we\u2019ve heard nothing about the Lubicon, Athabasca Chipewyan and Beaver Lake Cree downstream of the Alberta mines, who first raised the cry of concern about Canada\u2019s future with the tar sands. They understand what the Alberta and Canadian governments seem to not. To prevent climate breakdown, we must stop oil companies from digging up new deposits of fossil fuels. Government boosters of each pipeline project have instead sent a very clear message: to hell with our climate commitments. So Indigenous peoples have done what our governments will not: they\u2019ve drawn a line. At a meeting in Alberta ten years ago, long before the world knew of the tar sands, a young Indigenous activist named Clayton Thomas-Mueller pointed at a map of proposed pipelines, sprawling like tentacles across North America. \u201cThis map traces where our allies will emerge,\u201d he predicted. And so we\u2019ve seen new, diverse coalitions of Indigenous and non-Indigenous people spring forth in the pathway of the Northern Gateway, Keystone XL, and Energy East pipelines. Each has been stalled or halted. Kinder Morgan\u2019s TransMountain expansion \u2013 tripling its carrying capacity \u2013 is the latest. The thousands who\u2019ve flocked to Burnaby mountain the last weeks now know that real climate leaders aren\u2019t found in legislatures. They\u2019re found mounting blockades on the ground. The rule of law, you say? By pushing through the pipeline, Justin Trudeau bulldozes it himself. He violates Indigenous land rights on unceded lands that have been recognized by the Supreme Court, and the right to \u201cfree, prior informed consent\u201d in the United Nations declaration. He violates the Paris Climate Accords, whose ambitious target his government was praised for helping establish. And he violates an electoral mandate granted by a majority of British Columbians. In other words, the Indigenous-led opposition to pipelines aren\u2019t \u201crogue criminals\u201d or a \u201cnoisy minority.\u201d They\u2019re enforcing the democratic will of a province \u2013 and the sacred legal duties of the country. So don\u2019t let pundits and politicians pretend this crisis is about BC Premier John Horgan defying federal jurisdiction. Governments aren\u2019t provoking a new constitutional impasse. They\u2019re prolonging an old colonial pillage. Much of the remaining pools of global carbon \u2013 and the infrastructure to ship it out \u2013 are located on Indigenous peoples\u2019 territories. Which makes the attempt to trample through their lands by a foreign oil company \u2013 a spawn of Enron \u2013 part of a long, familiar story. Yet Justin Trudeau doesn\u2019t call this what it is. He calls it the \u201cnational interest.\u201d But wrapping a crime in the flag of national interest can only shroud the truth for so long. The wall of Indigenous-led protest points the way to a new story: a transition off fossil fuels to a thriving low-carbon economy. The world is already turning on the tar sands. Its shadow may tower over Canadian politics, but its contribution is diminishing and small: just 2 percent of our economy. The good news is that we can create far more jobs through investment in a clean energy transition than in oil and gas \u2013 as many as 34 times more. Such as in public transit, housing retrofits and health or care-giving work. Or by funding Indigenous-owned renewable projects that communities are already getting off the ground. So why are Trudeau and Alberta premier Rachel Notley spending our taxes bailing out a Texas oil billionaire? They should be bailing out Canada\u2019s workers, First Nations and the climate. To say that Indigenous peoples have become the heroes in this fight isn\u2019t high-minded romanticism. It\u2019s hard-bitten reality. Those First Nations who\u2019ve signed deals with Kinder Morgan struggle with crushing poverty \u2013 they are stuck between a pipeline and a hard place. And as Indigenous rights have become more formidable, the financials buy-offs \u2013 as much as $1bn per fossil fuel project \u2013 have only grown larger. This suggests one thing about the resistance of other First Nations: that it is even more remarkable. \u201cWe need the money [the project would bring], but we don\u2019t need it enough to sell out the things we love and are spiritually connected to \u2013 and that\u2019s our land, our water, our people,\u201d Rueben George of the Tsleil-Waututh First Nation said on Friday. The Tsleil-Waututh, and their many growing supporters, will be on watch when Kinder Morgan takes its likely next step: drilling a hole through Burnaby mountain. Polls show that 10 percent of British Columbians \u2013 an astonishing half-a-million people \u2013 are already prepared to engage in civil disobedience to stop it. They understand what government and industry hoped they would not: that Indigenous rights aren\u2019t just a tool to forge a safe, liveable future \u2013 they\u2019re the most powerful one we have. It means the best representative of our national interest isn\u2019t Justin Trudeau or Rachel Notley, nor even John Horgan. It\u2019s the Indigenous peoples standing in the path of a pipeline.

          "bodyText": "Justin Trudeau has said Canada\u2019s government is prepared to use taxpayer dollars to push forward plans for a controversial pipeline expansion, despite protests and efforts by a provincial government to halt the project on environmental grounds. For months, the provinces of Alberta and British Columbia have been locked in a standoff over plans, spearheaded by Texas-based Kinder Morgan, to expand an existing pipeline and lay nearly 1,000km of new pipe from Alberta\u2019s oil sands to the Pacific coast. While the project could allow Alberta to get its landlocked bitumen to markets in Asia and reduce its reliance on the US market, it has encountered opposition in British Columbia over the potential for oil spills and the impact that a dramatic rise in tanker traffic could have on the region\u2019s southern resident killer whales, a population already on the knife edge of extinction. The political stalemate over the C$7.4bn project catapulted into the national conversation last week after Kinder Morgan Canada announced it would walk away from the project unless it saw a clear path to completion by the end of May. Their project has now become a crucial test for Trudeau and his Liberal government, who swept into office in 2015 on promises of striking a balance between economic growth, environmental concerns and repairing the country\u2019s fraught relationship with indigenous peoples. \u201cWhile governments grant permits for resource development, only communities can grant permission,\u201d noted the Liberal party\u2019s 2015 platform. The pipeline expansion has put this sentiment to the test, with Vancouver and nearby Burnaby launching court actions against the project along with several First Nations communities. After taking power in 2017, the provincial government of British Columbia \u2013 a left-leaning coalition which relies on support from the Green Party \u2013 vowed to use all the tools available to them to halt the project. Recent weeks have seen indigenous-led protests against the project heat up, sending thousands into the streets. About 200 people have been arrested for blocking the entrance of facility belonging to Trans Mountain, including two federal MPs. On Sunday, Trudeau interrupted a foreign trip to meet the premiers of Alberta and British Columbia, reiterating his government\u2019s determination to see the project completed. \u201cThe Trans Mountain expansion is a vital strategic interest to Canada \u2212 it will be built,\u201d he told reporters after the meeting. The prime minister said the project \u2013 which would nearly triple the flow of Alberta\u2019s bitumen to the west coast \u2013 is in the national interest. \u201cIt means good jobs in Alberta, they\u2019ve suffered tough times. It means good jobs in BC, thousands of them as the pipeline is built.\u201d The uncertainty looming over trade relations between Canada and the US as well as waning investor confidence in Canada\u2019s ability to complete big projects reinforce why this expansion needs to go forward, he added. Trudeau said his government would launch formal financial discussions with Kinder Morgan and potentially use taxpayer dollars to ensure the project goes forward. As interprovincial pipelines are the federal government\u2019s jurisdiction, his government may also pursue legislation to assert Ottawa\u2019s authority over the project, he said. Approving the project in 2016, Trudeau said: \u201cI\u2019ve said many times that there isn\u2019t a country in the world that would find billions of barrels of oil and leave it in the ground while there is a market for it.\u201d After meeting Trudeau on Sunday, John Horgan, the premier of British Columbia, showed no sign that his government would drop its opposition to the project. \u201cMy obligation is to the people of BC, and I will defend that until I am no longer premier,\u201d he said.

An estimated 4,000 Canadians died last year due to opioids, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada \u2013 more than the number of Canadians who died due to motor vehicle accidents and homicides combined. </p> <p>In British Columbia, the western Canadian province where officials declared the opioid crisis a public health emergency in 2016, an average of four people die of overdoses each day. </p> <p>The federal Liberal government has taken steps to address the crisis, expediting <a href=\"http://idpc.net/alerts/2017/05/canada-eases-steps-to-open-supervised-drug-injection-sites-amid-opioid-crisis\">the approval of supervised injection sites</a> and permitting physicians to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jun/23/vancouver-supervised-injection-clinic-heroin\">prescribe heroin in cases of severe addiction.</a> These are important steps, said Erskine-Smith. \u201cBut obviously if we want to save lives we need to do more.\u201d </p> <p>That could mean adopting an idea that is gaining steam across Canada as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/20/canada-first-nations-kanai-reserve-drugs-opioid-fentanyl\">number of opioid deaths continue to swell.</a> Earlier this year, Canada\u2019s New Democratic Party became the first major political party in Canada to officially champion the idea. </p> <p>Weeks later the city of Vancouver recommended that the federal government immediately decriminalise personal possession of illicit drugs. \u201cWe are witnessing a horrific and preventable loss of life as a poisoned drug supply continues to kill our neighbours, friends and family,\u201d Gregor Robertson, Vancouver\u2019s mayor, <a href=\"http://mayorofvancouver.ca/news/vancouver-sees-alarming-trend-steady-increase-overdose-deaths\">said in a statement.</a></p> <p>Their stance is backed by prominent organisations, from the Global Commission on Drug Policy to the <a href=\"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2017/discrimination-in-health-care/en/\">World Health Organization</a>. Many of them point to the experience of Portugal, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/dec/05/portugals-radical-drugs-policy-is-working-why-hasnt-the-world-copied-it\">which in 2001 did away with criminal penalties</a> for simple possession and consumption of illicit drugs. </p> <p>The move was coupled with an expansion of treatment and harm reduction services such as safe injection sites. In Portugal, those caught with drugs appear before dissuasion commissions, which can refer people to treatment or impose monetary fines.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/dec/05/portugals-radical-drugs-policy-is-working-why-hasnt-the-world-copied-it\">Portugal\u2019s radical drugs policy is working. Why hasn\u2019t the world copied it?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Statistics suggest the approach is working; Portugal has seen dramatic drops in overdose deaths, HIV infection rates and drug-related crimes, while the number of drug users seeking treatment has increased.</p> <p>Should the Liberals approve their resolution this week, decriminalisation would be backed by two of Canada\u2019s three major parties. But even so, there is little guarantee that the idea will make its way into the Liberal platform in the upcoming 2019 federal election. Trudeau, who leads the party, has repeatedly said his government is <a href=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2017/09/07/pm-says-no-to-decriminalizing-drugs-bc-addictions-minister-open-to-idea.html\">not considering legalising any other drugs</a> besides marijuana.</p> <p>Erskine-Smith stressed the difference between the two issues.

          "bodyText": "With months left before Canada becomes the first country in the G7 to fully legalise marijuana, members of the country\u2019s Liberal party, led federally by Justin Trudeau, are calling on their government to go one step further and decriminalise the possession and consumption of all illicit drugs. The internal push to embrace the idea is one of more than two dozen resolutions set to be debated this week as the political party gathers for their national convention in the east coast city of Halifax. The resolution is one of three put forward by the national caucus, suggesting widespread support among Liberal MPs. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the few issues where we\u2019re taught from a young age, that drugs are bad and that it\u2019s normal to throw people in jail for using drugs,\u201d said Nathaniel Erskine-Smith, a Liberal MP who has championed decriminalisation since he was elected in 2015. \u201cYet when you actually start looking underneath those claims and at the actual evidence and hear from people who have study or lived this issue, this isn\u2019t the right approach.\u201d Framing drug use as a criminal justice issue rather than one of health has simply served to fuel a lucrative black market, divert resources from law enforcement and marginalise those who are often already on the margins of society, he argued. The push towards decriminalisation comes as the opioid crisis continues to claim thousands of lives on both sides of the 49th parallel. An estimated 4,000 Canadians died last year due to opioids, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada \u2013 more than the number of Canadians who died due to motor vehicle accidents and homicides combined. In British Columbia, the western Canadian province where officials declared the opioid crisis a public health emergency in 2016, an average of four people die of overdoses each day. The federal Liberal government has taken steps to address the crisis, expediting the approval of supervised injection sites and permitting physicians to prescribe heroin in cases of severe addiction. These are important steps, said Erskine-Smith. \u201cBut obviously if we want to save lives we need to do more.\u201d That could mean adopting an idea that is gaining steam across Canada as the number of opioid deaths continue to swell. Earlier this year, Canada\u2019s New Democratic Party became the first major political party in Canada to officially champion the idea. Weeks later the city of Vancouver recommended that the federal government immediately decriminalise personal possession of illicit drugs. \u201cWe are witnessing a horrific and preventable loss of life as a poisoned drug supply continues to kill our neighbours, friends and family,\u201d Gregor Robertson, Vancouver\u2019s mayor, said in a statement. Their stance is backed by prominent organisations, from the Global Commission on Drug Policy to the World Health Organization. Many of them point to the experience of Portugal, which in 2001 did away with criminal penalties for simple possession and consumption of illicit drugs. The move was coupled with an expansion of treatment and harm reduction services such as safe injection sites. In Portugal, those caught with drugs appear before dissuasion commissions, which can refer people to treatment or impose monetary fines. Statistics suggest the approach is working; Portugal has seen dramatic drops in overdose deaths, HIV infection rates and drug-related crimes, while the number of drug users seeking treatment has increased. Should the Liberals approve their resolution this week, decriminalisation would be backed by two of Canada\u2019s three major parties. But even so, there is little guarantee that the idea will make its way into the Liberal platform in the upcoming 2019 federal election. Trudeau, who leads the party, has repeatedly said his government is not considering legalising any other drugs besides marijuana. Erskine-Smith stressed the difference between the two issues. The federal government\u2019s efforts to end marijuana prohibition aim to halt the flow of profits to organised crime, given that Canadians spent an estimated C$5.7 billion on marijuana last year. But when it comes to decriminalisation, said Erskine-Smith, \u201cwe\u2019re not talking removing the criminal sanction for sale, we\u2019re not talking removing the criminal sanction for production, as we did with cannabis.\u201d The change in approach comes with political risks, he acknowledged. Canada\u2019s Conservative party remains staunchly opposed to the idea and have shown themselves willing to exploit fears over the proposal to gain votes. Last year the party\u2019s leader Andrew Scheer attacked Trudeau on Twitter, alleging that his government was considering decriminalisation drugs beside marijuana. \u201cIt\u2019s funny. When you talk to conservative members of Parliament one-on-one, I think they\u2019re open to the idea,\u201d said Erskine-Smith. \u201cBut my hope is \u2013 especially when confronted with the numbers of Canadians who have lost their lives, and we\u2019re talking Canadians of all backgrounds, Canadians of all political parties \u2013 I really do hope we\u2019re all able to get past the politics of it and follow the evidence.\u201d",

He can do whatever he wants to do. In fact, we will celebrate rather than grieve. Trump is trying to cover his failure in proving that the Syrian army used chemical weapons against Douma. All these allegations were used as a pretext to launch this criminal aggression against Syria. If the Syrian army wants to use chemical weapons, it would not be fighting for all these long years to avoid causing harm to any civilians. The war would have been much shorter but whenever the Syrian army achieves a victory on the ground and clean its land of terrorists, the US and its coalitions fabricate lies to attack Syria, something that will never undermine our will and love for our country.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-04-14T14:39:25.838Z\">at 3.39pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ad20cf2e4b0a1c89d37df4c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/jamie-grierson\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-04-14T14:17:23.000Z\">3.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Airstrikes \"unacceptable and lawless\" - Russian foreign minister</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has told a press conference the actions of UK, US and France in Syria are \u201cunacceptable and lawless\u201d.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-04-14T14:39:07.895Z\">at 3.39pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ad209f4e4b0db851d6274db\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/peterbeaumont\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-04-14T14:05:11.306Z\">3.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">UK government issues summary of legal advice</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The UK government has released a summary of its legal advice authorising air strikes against Syria over its alleged use of chemical weapons, which is certain to be at the centre of controversy in the coming days, not least as parliament comes back.</p> \n  <p>The advice argues that there were three key legal considerations that had been satisfied: \u201cconvincing evidence, generally accepted by the international community as a whole, of extreme humanitarian distress on a large scale, requiring immediate and urgent relief; no practicable alternative to the use of force if lives are to be saved, and that the proposed use of force must be necessary and proportionate to the aim of relief\u201d.<br></p> \n  <p>Arguments are most likely to focus in the coming days on the first two conditions.<br></p> \n  <p>Syria\u2019s allies, including Russia and Iran, as well as other opponents of the military action will dispute that the \u201cevidence\u201d - in particular the assessment presented by France \u2013 is \u201cgenerally accepted by the international community\u201d, with Russia continuing to stick to its version that the attack was \u201cstaged\u201d.<br></p> \n  <p>Critics are also likely to home in on the fact that the strikes took place before two teams of chemical weapons inspectors, who had stated their intentional of visiting Douma \u2013 the site of last weekend\u2019s attack \u2013 were able to do their work and present their reporting which would also inform the issue of \u201cpracticable alternative[s] to the use of force\u201d.<br></p> \n  <p>The counter argument to these criticisms will be made that Russia, through use of its veto, has made it almost impossible to secure agreement on evidence of culpability or alternatives.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-04-14T14:11:16.454Z\">at 3.11pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ad20424e4b0e47a8e8070e9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/jamie-grierson\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-04-14T13:42:24.549Z\">2.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Asked if Trump\u2019s \u201cmission accomplished\u201d comments were accurate, White says: \u201cLast night\u2019s operations were very successful.

They must be allowed to complete their inspections without hindrance.</p> \n   <p>Acting through the United Nations, I believe Britain should now take a diplomatic lead to negotiate a pause in this abhorrent conflict in which hundreds of thousands of Syrians have already been killed and millions displaced. The refugee crisis places a responsibility on all countries and I the government will now increase its commitment to take additional refugees. Hundreds of unaccompanied children remain in Europe and the UK must do more through the Dubs amendment.This means engaging with all parties that are involved in the conflict \u2013 including Iran, Israel, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the US \u2013 to ensure there is an immediate ceasefire. We have the grotesque spectacle of a wider geopolitical proxy battle being waged with the Syrian people used as pawns by all sides.</p> \n   <p>I would welcome your assurance that Britain will embark on renewed diplomatic efforts to end this conflict. Our only priority must be the safety and security of the Syrian people \u2013 which is best served by de-escalating this conflict, so that aid can get in.</p> \n   <p>Yours sincerely,</p> \n   <p>Jeremy Corbyn MP</p> \n   <p>Leader of the Opposition</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-04-14T12:13:15.041Z\">at 1.13pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ad1df71e4b0db851d6273a2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/mona-mahmood\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-04-14T11:42:18.359Z\">12.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Our Middle East reporter, Mona Mahmood, has spoken to a resident of Damascus about his experience overnight.</p> \n  <p>Hussam Youis, 27, said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We thought Trump\u2019s threats were empty words as he was late in implementing them and that is why we went to bed as usual, only to wake up suddenly at the drastic sounds of the explosions. </p> \n   <p>I ran at 4am with my family to a nearby shelter built in a school to find lots of people who were already there, with their terrified children.</p> \n   <p>Some of these rockets deviated of their main targeted and fell on the houses of the civilians.</p> \n   <p>The pretext of the chemical attack against Douma is a blatant lie used by Trump and other states who are in support of him to attack Syria. </p> \n   <p>This vicious act won\u2019t change anything on the ground, as Syrian people who have been fighting terrorism for more than seven years a couple of rockets would not frighten us.

          "bodyText": "We\u2019re going to pause our live coverage of the Syria strikes there. Here\u2019s where things stand: At the United Nations, the security council rejected a Russian resolution condemning \u201cthe aggression\u201d against Syria by the United States and its allies. Only three countries - Russia itself, plus China and Bolivia - backed Moscow\u2019s resolution calling for condemnation of the airstrikes carried out on Friday night. After the vote, the Russian envoy, Vassily Nebenzia said: \u201cToday is a very sad day for the world, the UN, its charter, which was blatantly, blatantly violated.\u201d A senior US administration official went further than the Pentagon in saying sarin nerve agent was used by the Assad regime in Douma on 7 April. \u201cWe assess that chlorine and sarin were used in the attack,\u201d the official said, pointing as evidence to the nature of the victims\u2019 symptoms, such as the narrowing of pupils in their eyes, and the effects on their nervous systems, along with the sheer lethality of the gas. \u201cThose symptoms don\u2019t come from chlorine - they come from sarin,\u201d she added. Syrians remained divided over the airstrikes. Wael Abdullah, a 25-year-old resident of Ghouta, told the Guardian: \u201cThis is a great step by President Trump by which he sends a hot message to Bashar Al-Assad that he can\u2019t continue killing his people by all kinds of weapons with the help of the Russians and Iranians.\u201d But Ayad Younis, a 35-year-old teacher in a secondary school in Damascus, said: \u201cThis is a blatant aggression against Syria, a staged drama created by the US to attack our land.\u201d Western leaders continued to add their voices of support for the US, France and UK airstrikes. \u201cCanada stands with our friends in this necessary response and we condemn in strongest possible terms\u201d the use of chemical weapons in Syria,\u201d Justin Trudeau said on Saturday. Of the European leaders, only Italian premier Paolo Gentiloni warned that while this was a \u201climited and targeted action ... it cannot and should not be the start of an escalation\u201d. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, described the strikes as an \u201cact of aggression\u201d and said the attack would worsen the humanitarian crisis in Syria. Anatoly Antonov, the Russian ambassador to the US, said \u201csuch actions will not be left without consequences\u201d and that Moscow was being threatened. The US ambassador to the UN said Washington was \u201clocked and loaded\u201d to strike again if Syria\u2019s president Bashar al-Assad again uses chemical weapons, at a fiery UN security council meeting in which the Russian ambassador accused the US, UK and France of \u201cdiplomatic hooliganism\u201d. The US, British and French strikes were aimed at damaging the Syrian regime\u2019s chemical weapons facilities in the wake of last weekend\u2019s gas attack on the Damascus suburb of Douma. Some 105 missiles were fired in total, the Pentagon said. That\u2019s it from us. Here are our latest stories on the fallout from the strikes: Syria\u2019s deputy parliamentary speaker said Saturday that he believes western countries could launch new airstrikes on his country using chemical weapons as a pretext. Najdat Anzour also told the Associated Press that western countries want to resume Syria peace talks in Geneva conditional on drafting a new constitution, holding presidential elections, and forming a cabinet with the participation of armed opposition groups. Anzour said the pre-conditions were \u201cunacceptable and impossible\u201d. Mona Mahmood has interviewed Syrians in favor of and opposed to the joint military action. Wael Abdullah, a 25-year-old resident of Ghouta and who had to flee to the countryside outside Aleppo, told the Guardian: This is a great step by President Trump by which he sends a hot message to Bashar Al-Assad that he can\u2019t continue killing his people by all kinds of weapons with the help of the Russians and Iranians. We are looking for more to get to the day that we celebrate the toppling of the Syrian regime. He continued: \u201cWe know that these rockets will not stop Bashar and his gangsters in keeping on killing the Syrian people, but they are good to make him aware that there will be a response from now on to all his vicious acts against his innocent people. \u201cThe best thing the US administration can do to the Syrian people is to launch an attack in cooperation with all Syrian factions who have been fighting the regime. We want an all-out war that could put an end to this tragedy. I\u2019m sure the US president and his allies have full knowledge of what is going on Syria. They should not act just when Bashar uses chemical weapons and then leave his hand free.\u201d In contrast, Ayad Younis, a 35-year-old teacher in a secondary school in Damascus, said: This is a blatant aggression against Syria, a staged drama created by the US to attack our land. It is incredible that these superpowers would get their information from social networks though they are full of lies and fabrications about the use of chemical weapons against our people in Douma. He added: \u201cI woke up at midnight with my wife and one year kid to the sound of the explosions. At the beginning, I thought this is thunder but when I opened the window, I found people on the roofs watching what was happening. TV news confirmed that most of the rockets were intercepted and deviated. \u201cI think the aim of the aggression is to achieve a moral victory for the US which considered itself a super state. If Trump threatens, then he has to fulfill his threats, that is all. This aggression changes nothing in my belief that Syria is winning. I already lost a number of my relatives in our war and these terrorists want to turn Syria to a jungle. Their malicious attempts will be foiled and they will be defeated. \u201cI denounce this immoral act. We have passed the most seven difficult years in the history of Syria, a couple of rockets won\u2019t change anything on the ground, yet, will encourage us to fight for Syria.\u201d A senior administration official on Saturday went further than the Pentagon in saying sarin nerve agent was used by the Assad regime in Douma on 7 April. \u201cWe assess that chlorine and sarin were used in the attack,\u201d the official said, pointing as evidence to the nature of the victims\u2019 symptoms, such as the narrowing of pupils in their eyes, and the effects on their nervous systems, along with the sheer lethality of the gas. \u201cThose symptoms don\u2019t come from chlorine - they come from sarin,\u201d she added. Officials said that there was evidence that chlorine and sarin have been used by the regime on multiple occasions since the last US air strikes in April 2017, and expressed anger at Russia for blocking all other attempts to rein Bashar al-Assad\u2019s behaviour, at the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and at the UN security council, where Russia voted six times to stop the continuation of UN watchdog body empowered to investigate chemical weapons attacks and attribute responsibility for carrying them out. \u201cRussia has failed,\u201d the senior administration official said. \u201cPutin has four years to make good on his commitment to rid Syria of chemical weapons use. The president was not just going to wait around for Russia to mount yet another disinformation campaign that would deflect attention from the fact that Russia is the one that\u2019s enabling Syria to continue on with this behaviour.\u201d Russia has been defeated in its bid to have the US, France and UK airstrikes condemned in the UN security council. Only three countries - Russia itself, plus China and Bolivia - backed Moscow\u2019s resolution calling for condemnation of the \u201caggression\u201d by the United States and its allies against Syria. With eight countries voting against, and four abstentions - Ethiopia, Kazakhstan, Peru and Equitorial Guinea - the failure of the Russian resolution was a stinging diplomatic defeat for Moscow. After the vote, the Russian envoy, Vassily Nebenzia said: \u201cToday is a very sad day for the world, the UN, its charter, which was blatantly, blatantly violated.\u201d The failure of the resolution confirms how isolated Russia has become on the Syrian issue. This week, Russia used its veto power for the 12th time to block action in the security council over Syria, including four attempts to establish investigations of chemical weapons use in the country\u2019s seven-year war. There are five permanent members of the security council \u2013 China, France, Russia, the UK and the US - and 10 rotating members, currently Bolivia, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Netherlands, Peru, Poland, and Sweden. Russia\u2019s UN ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, is demanding a vote on a resolution that would condemn \u201cthe aggression\u201d against Syria by the United States and its allies. But Russia\u2019s demand, which calls for military action to stop \u201cimmediately and without delay\u201d, will almost certainly be rejected when the resolution is voted on in the Security Council later today. The Canadian prime minister and several European leaders have added their support for the US-led airstrikes against Syrian chemical weapons targets. \u201cCanada stands with our friends in this necessary response and we condemn in strongest possible terms\u201d the use of chemical weapons in Syria,\u201d Justin Trudeau said on Saturday. European council president Donald Tusk, one of the key leaders of the EU, added his voice to the denunciations of Russia and Iran\u2019s support for the Assad regime. \u201cStrikes by US, France and UK make it clear that Syrian regime together with Russia &amp; Iran cannot continue this human tragedy, at least not without cost. The EU will stand with our allies on the side of justice,\u201d Tusk tweeted. Bulgaria, which currently holds the rotating EU presidency, said: \u201cThe strike on Syrian targets was a response to a war crime.\u201d German chancellor Angela Merkel described the strikes as a \u201cnecessary and appropriate in order to preserve the effectiveness of the international ban on the use of chemical weapons and to warn the Syrian regime against further violations\u201d. Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan and European Union commission president Jean-Claude Juncker \u2013 another EU leader \u2013 also issued statements supporting the action. But Italian premier Paolo Gentiloni warned that while this was a \u201climited and targeted action ... it cannot and should not be the start of an escalation\u201d. Here Julian Borger assesses how dangerous this moment of conflict is for the globe: The US launched military strikes alongside UK and French forces on Saturday morning aimed at damaging the Syrian regime\u2019s chemical weapons facilities in the wake of last weekend\u2019s gas attack on the Damascus suburb of Douma. Some 105 missiles were fired in total, the Pentagon said. Moments after Donald Trump finished his address on Friday night, reports emerged of explosions in Damascus at about 2am BST (9pm ET). A Pentagon briefing later confirmed three sites were hit: two in Damascus and one in Homs. The sites were all regarded as being linked to the storage, or testing, of chemical weapons. Syrian air defences responded to the strikes but the US said it had suffered no losses in the initial airstrikes. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, described the strikes as an \u201cact of aggression\u201d and said the attack would worsen the humanitarian crisis in Syria. Anatoly Antonov, the Russian ambassador to the US, said \u201csuch actions will not be left without consequences\u201d and that Moscow was being threatened. The US ambassador to the UN said Washington was \u201clocked and loaded\u201d to strike again if Syria\u2019s president Bashar al-Assad again uses chemical weapons, at a fiery UN security council meeting in which the Russian ambassador accused the US, UK and France of \u201cdiplomatic hooliganism\u201d.

I am handing over the blog to my colleague Edward Helmore. Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg has said all members of the organisation back this morning\u2019s airstrikes conducted by the US, the UK and France following a meeting of the North Atlantic Council - the principal political decision-making body of Nato. The United States, France and Britain told Nato envoys on Saturday their coordinated air strikes on Syrian government targets overnight were a last resort and aimed to stop more chemical attacks, the alliance\u2019s chief said. The three allies briefed Nato ambassadors at a special session at the alliance headquarters and won support from the other 26 Nato members, who sought more diplomatic pressure to uphold an international ban on poison gas attacks like the one the West believes Syria conducted on April 7 in Douma. The strikes \u201cdegraded the capabilities of Syria to conduct new attacks and at the same time send a clear message which deters further attacks\u201d, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told a news conference after the meeting. \u201cWe will never have a total guarantee against new attacks as long as we have regimes which are willing to use chemical weapons,\u201d he said. \u201cChemical weapons cannot be used with impunity and cannot be normalised.\u201d Nato was not involved in the strikes. In a separate statement, Nato envoys called on Syria, Russia and Iran to allow \u201crapid, sustained and unhindered humanitarian access\u201d to areas targeted in Syria\u2019s seven-year-old war. The UK ambassador to the UN, Karen Pierce, told the security council meeting there had been \u201cclear boundaries\u201d in the action that had been taken in an attempt to avoid escalation. She said repeated attempts to hold the Syrian regime to account had been met with Russian \u201cobstruction and resistance\u201d. \u201cWe have repeatedly in this council attempted to overcome this obstruction, without success,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are faced with a litany of violations, no sense of guilt, no sense of regret, no sense of responsibility, a shameful record wrapped in a mix of denial, deceit and disinformation.\u201d Pierce finished by adding: \u201cI will take no lessons in international law from Russia.\u201d In Brussels, where officials have been watching developments closely, all eyes are on Russia\u2019s possible reaction. One senior minister, who preferred to remain unnamed, said while it thought Moscow would pursue diplomatic channels in the coming days, a more strident response could not be ruled out. \u201cThere is definitely concern over what Russia will do but for the moment it seems they will not react militarily,\u201d said the official who holds a post at the highest levels of the European Commission. \u201cWe\u2019ve been meeting this afternoon to discuss reaction and the feeling is Moscow will definitely do something beyond the diplomatic although what no one knows. It can turn off gas [supplies to Europe] or ratchet up tensions in the Ukraine again.\u201d The United States is \u201clocked and loaded\u201d to strike again if Syria\u2019s President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s government again uses chemical weapons, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley told the security council on Saturday. \u201cWe are confident that we have crippled Syria\u2019s chemical weapons program. We are prepared to sustain this pressure, if the Syrian regime is foolish enough to test our will,\u201d she said. \u201cIf the Syrian regime uses this poison gas again, the United States is locked and loaded,\u201d Haley said. Cyprus\u2019 respected former foreign minister Ioannis Kassoulides has described the wait for the airstrikes \u201cas more painful than the strike itself.\u201d Four RAF Tornados took off from Akrotiri, in the island\u2019s south armed with Storm shadow missiles, around 3 AM before returning to base less than two hours later after firing eight missiles at a chemicals weapons facility near Homs. \u201cI believe that it will be forgotten in the coming days, also by those wishing to book their holidays in Cyprus,\u201d he said shortly before the British prime minister Theresa May called her Cypriot counterpart president Nicos Anastasiades to brief him on the military action. Earlier, the government spokesman Prodromos Prodromou had predicted that the strikes would be \u201c a face saving\u201d exercised aimed. squarely. at sending a message to the Syrian regime and Russia. Ambassador Vasily Nebenzya has said the US-led strikes in Syria were \u201can act of aggression\u201d against a sovereign state, accusing the UK, France and the US of \u201cdiplomatic hooliganism\u201d and showing a blatant disregard for international law. UN secretary general Antonio Guterres spoke at the start of the meeting. He called on all members of the security council to show restraint and avoid further escalation in Syria. He said Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) inspectors are in Syria and ready to inspect the site of last Saturday\u2019s chemical attack near Damascus. The OPCW confirmed this a short while ago. Vasily Nebenzya, the Russian ambassador to the UN, is about to share his thoughts. The UN security council meeting on Saturday\u2019s strikes in Syria is just about to start. We will bring you the key developments. Photos of the aftermath of the strikes on the Syrian Scientific Research Centre near Damascus have been taken during press tour organised by the Syrian information ministry on Saturday. Melania Trump has joined her husband in thanking the US military, although she does not mention the strikes in Syria directly. Russia has proposed a draft United Nations security council resolution that would condemn \u201cthe aggression against the Syrian Arab Republic by the U.S. and its allies in violation of international law and the U.N. Charter\u201d, Reuters are reporting. It was not immediately clear when it could be put to a vote. It was unlikely to get the minimum nine votes needed to force a veto by the United States, France or Britain, said diplomats. A resolution needs nine votes in favour and no vetoes by Russia, China, France, Britain or the United States to pass. Read more about the Russian response to the strikes here: Over at the RAF base in Akrotiri, Cyprus it is business as usual barely 12 hours after four Tornados returned from their overnight bombing mission. Within hours of the strikes, the sleepy village outside the British base had returned to its somnolent ways: parents taking their kids to weekend dances, the elderly pegging clothes to washing lines, locals downing beers in the Swan pub. By midday, long before US president Trump tweeted \u201cmission accomplished,\u201d the roar of the four Syria-bound Tornados flying overhead was a distant memory. \u201cWe woke up with all the noise but that\u2019s nothing new here,\u201d said Giorgos Xenophontas, serving bar food at the Swan. \u201cUsually it\u2019s two, [fighter bombers] not four, flying out at the same time and 3am is an unusual hour but it\u2019s kinda over now and forgotten.\u201d Giorgos Philippou, who owns the fish and chip shop in the village with his English wife, Shaniece, dismissed fears of Russian retaliation widely circulated in the media. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard a lot about that here,\u201d he quipped. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think there is anyone who seriously believes it would happen. Why would they strike here and not stage a counter attack in Britain? \u201d Others, however, were concerned that Russia would at some point react \u2013 and that the village - population 1,000 - could be hit. Security concerns have grown as sorties out of the base by bomber jets targeting Islamic State sites in Syria and Iraq have also risen. \u201cEveryone worries, especially those with children, that there could be some kind of punishment,\u201d said Bambos Charalambos, 44, a public works employee with the Cypriot government. \u201cThey just prefer to keep quiet because most in Akrotiri work at the base and, in some way, are dependent on it.\u201d Locals still have vivid memories of a RAF tornado jet losing two missiles mid-air in July 2015 as it prepared to land back at base on Cyprus. \u201cLucky for us the missiles didn\u2019t explode,\u201d said Charalambos. \u201cIt was really frightening. Russia could react one day and miss the base and target us instead.\u201d Our world affairs editor, Julian Borger, has written this guide to key players int he Syrian conflict. Read more here: Our Middle East reporter, Mona Mahmood, has spoken to Amira Jaber, a 46-year-old mother from Homs province in Syria. A chemical weapons storage facility west of Homs, and another storage site and command post nearby were hit early on Saturday morning. She said: We were sleeping in peace at midnight and then we were surprised by the horrible sounds of the explosions. The target was the centre of research in Homs. It was something very terrifying especially for the kids. Trump is mentally ill and he won\u2019t scared us with his rockets. I have two sons, one of them was martyred while he was fighting with the Syrian army to liberate Syria of the criminals and terrorists. My other son is a policeman, he is still doing his job to serve his country. We will win as long as our president is Bashar Al-Assad. Since the morning until now, demonstrations in Homs are going on and people are marching in the streets to confirm that we will stay in Syria and will defend it with the last drop of our blood. I lost my son and I myself am ready to die for Syria and president Bashar. Trump is a beggar and he wants to get more money form the Gulf for attacking Syria. We were following Trump\u2019s threats but we did not take any precautions, nothing worse can happen than what we have already gone through. He can do whatever he wants to do. In fact, we will celebrate rather than grieve. Trump is trying to cover his failure in proving that the Syrian army used chemical weapons against Douma. All these allegations were used as a pretext to launch this criminal aggression against Syria. If the Syrian army wants to use chemical weapons, it would not be fighting for all these long years to avoid causing harm to any civilians. The war would have been much shorter but whenever the Syrian army achieves a victory on the ground and clean its land of terrorists, the US and its coalitions fabricate lies to attack Syria, something that will never undermine our will and love for our country. Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has told a press conference the actions of UK, US and France in Syria are \u201cunacceptable and lawless\u201d. The UK government has released a summary of its legal advice authorising air strikes against Syria over its alleged use of chemical weapons, which is certain to be at the centre of controversy in the coming days, not least as parliament comes back. The advice argues that there were three key legal considerations that had been satisfied: \u201cconvincing evidence, generally accepted by the international community as a whole, of extreme humanitarian distress on a large scale, requiring immediate and urgent relief; no practicable alternative to the use of force if lives are to be saved, and that the proposed use of force must be necessary and proportionate to the aim of relief\u201d. Arguments are most likely to focus in the coming days on the first two conditions. Syria\u2019s allies, including Russia and Iran, as well as other opponents of the military action will dispute that the \u201cevidence\u201d - in particular the assessment presented by France \u2013 is \u201cgenerally accepted by the international community\u201d, with Russia continuing to stick to its version that the attack was \u201cstaged\u201d. Critics are also likely to home in on the fact that the strikes took place before two teams of chemical weapons inspectors, who had stated their intentional of visiting Douma \u2013 the site of last weekend\u2019s attack \u2013 were able to do their work and present their reporting which would also inform the issue of \u201cpracticable alternative[s] to the use of force\u201d. The counter argument to these criticisms will be made that Russia, through use of its veto, has made it almost impossible to secure agreement on evidence of culpability or alternatives. Asked if Trump\u2019s \u201cmission accomplished\u201d comments were accurate, White says: \u201cLast night\u2019s operations were very successful. We met our objectives. So it was mission accomplished.\u201d Pressed on the matter, White said: \u201cIt was a successful mission. What happened next depends on what the Assad regime decides to do.\u201d Some Syria chemical weapons infrastructure remains, McKenzie says, but the airstrikes have significantly reduced the country\u2019s chemical weapons capability. Asked if retaliation is expected, McKenzie said he could not say but added: \u201cWe\u2019re ready for it. We\u2019re on the balls of our feet and ready for anything.\u201d White, Pentagon spokesperson said: \u201cWe took action and what happens next is the decision of Assad.\u201d McKenzie says Russian air defence systems were not deployed. There were no agreements with Russia in advance, he adds. No Syrian had any impact on anything the US, UK or French forces did, he says. The Syrian regime knows US was looking at targets so possible some personnel may have left the facilities targeted, McKenzie say. However, the attacks were launched at 3am local time so unlikely many people there. Lt Gen McKenzie said \u201cas of now\u201d US not aware of any civilian casualties. He tells reporters that US belives there were chemical weapons and nerve agents stored on the Barzah research site, that was destroyed by airstrikes. He said the attacks were launched in such a way as to minimise any fallout by way of dispersal of chemicals into the air. The chief pentagon spokesperson, Dana W White, is giving an update alongside Lt Gen Kenneth McKenzie, the director of the Joint Staff (DJS), a senior military adviser to the US president. White said the attacks were not an attempt to depose the Assad regime and do not signify a shift in US policy. She said the airstrikes had been launched to \u201ccripple Syria\u2019s ability to use chemical weapons in the future\u201d and had \u201csuccessfully hit every target\u201d. She insisted the strikes did not \u201crepresent a change in US policy or an attempt to depose the Syrian regime\u201d and that the US focus was to defeat the Islamic State terror group. But, she added: \u201cWe cannot allow such grievous violations of international law.\u201d McKenzie took reporters through the airstrikes, saying 105 weapons were deployed against targets. He said the strikes will deter use of chemical weapons in the future. McKenzie said: \u201cI\u2019d use three words to describe this operation - precise, overwhelming and effective.\u201d Theresa May\u2019s argument for bombing in Syria is \u201cnonsensical\u201d argues Andrew Adonis, the Labour peer, in the Guardian. Theresa May\u2019s essential argument that the bombing in Syria in the early hours of Saturday was \u201cstrong enough to deter but weak enough not to provoke the Russians\u201d is so obviously nonsensical it explains why she didn\u2019t wish to make it in parliament. This was \u201cgesture bombing\u201d of carefully selected second-order military installations, to be seen to be doing something \u2013 but not too much \u2013 in response to Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad\u2019s apparent chemical weapons attack, enabled by the Russians, on civilians in the Damascus enclave of Douma last week. Read more here: The US president is awake and tweeting. Egypt is the latest country to issue a response to the US-led strikes in Syria, expressing its \u201cdeep concern\u201d over further military escalation in the region. Without specifically mentioning the overnight missile strikes, Egypt\u2019s foreign ministry rejected the use of internationally banned weapons on Syrian territory and demanded a transparent international investigation into last Saturday\u2019s use of chemical weapons, Reuters reported. \u201cThe Arab Republic of Egypt expresses its solidarity with the brotherly Syrian people in their aspirations to live in security and stability,\u201d the ministry said in a statement. It called for a peaceful resolution to the Syrian crisis and efforts to ensure humanitarian aid reaches those affected by the conflict. Our Middle East reporter, Mona Mahmood, has spoken to Fahad Alqadi, a 46-year-old lawyer from rebel held Idlib in northern Syria about the attacks. He said: I believe this US airstrike against Bashar Al-Assad is the only choice left for the world to stop his crimes against the Syrian people. All talks and conferences proved to be futile. We do not want a war that might destroy Syria, which is already destroyed by the Russians and Iranians. We want diplomatic pressures to force Bashar and Shia militias to leave Syria and let the Syrian people live like any normal people in the world. The message of the US-led airstrikes is that US, UK and France can act without getting the approval of the Russians and this is a very important turning point in the Syrian crisis. The Russians have been manipulating the Syrian cause for more than two years with the Iranians and blocking any international act against the massacres committed by the Syrian regime.This is a message to the Russian president, not to Bashar that Syria is not one of his properties. We are in support of any military or diplomatic attempt that can force Bashar to leave and end the suffering of the Syrian people. War is the worst choice because the result might be disastrous, but we have lost hope that the Syrian regime would response to any diplomatic solutions. I hope the pressure will continue and this airstrike is only the beginning. The UN security council will meet at 4pm UK time in New York to discuss the overnight missile strikes on Syria at the request of Russia. Meanwhile, the Russian news agency RIA are reporting that Moscow is in touch with the US and other countries about the attack and is interested in cooperation with Washington on Syria, deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov said on Saturday. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has written to Theresa May questioning the legality of this morning\u2019s missile strikes in Syria, and has asked the PM to publish the legal advice she received from the attorney general in relation to the attack. In the letter, he writes \u201cthe UK prime minister is accountable to parliament, not the whims of the US president\u201d, and calls for the UK to lead diplomatic engagement with all parties involved in the Syrian conflict to end the violence. The Press Association are reporting that Downing Street will release a summary of the legal advice it received about the strikes later on Saturday, according to unnamed sources. Here is the full letter: Dear Prime Minister, I want to thank you for speaking to me last night regarding the bombing raids in Syria overnight, and for the security briefing you shared. I am very glad that all British military personnel have returned home safely, and hope too that there have been no civilian casualties in Syria. As I said I believe that Parliament should have been consulted and voted on the matter. The UK Prime Minister is accountable to Parliament, not to the whims of a US President. I believe the action was legally questionable, and this morning the UN Secretary General has said as much, reiterating that all countries must act in line with the UN Charter. You assured me that the Attorney General had given clear legal advice approving the action. I would therefore be grateful if you would publish this advice in full today. Given that neither the UN nor the OPCW has yet investigated, it is clear that diplomatic and non-military means have not been fully exhausted. It is now vitally important that the OPCW inspectors, who are due to arrive in Douma today, are allowed to do their work and publish their report into their findings \u2013 and report to the United Nations Security Council. I would therefore welcome your assurance that there will be no further bombing raids while OPCW inspectors are on the ground. They must be allowed to complete their inspections without hindrance. Acting through the United Nations, I believe Britain should now take a diplomatic lead to negotiate a pause in this abhorrent conflict in which hundreds of thousands of Syrians have already been killed and millions displaced. The refugee crisis places a responsibility on all countries and I the government will now increase its commitment to take additional refugees. Hundreds of unaccompanied children remain in Europe and the UK must do more through the Dubs amendment.This means engaging with all parties that are involved in the conflict \u2013 including Iran, Israel, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the US \u2013 to ensure there is an immediate ceasefire. We have the grotesque spectacle of a wider geopolitical proxy battle being waged with the Syrian people used as pawns by all sides. I would welcome your assurance that Britain will embark on renewed diplomatic efforts to end this conflict. Our only priority must be the safety and security of the Syrian people \u2013 which is best served by de-escalating this conflict, so that aid can get in. Yours sincerely, Jeremy Corbyn MP Leader of the Opposition Our Middle East reporter, Mona Mahmood, has spoken to a resident of Damascus about his experience overnight. Hussam Youis, 27, said: We thought Trump\u2019s threats were empty words as he was late in implementing them and that is why we went to bed as usual, only to wake up suddenly at the drastic sounds of the explosions. I ran at 4am with my family to a nearby shelter built in a school to find lots of people who were already there, with their terrified children. Some of these rockets deviated of their main targeted and fell on the houses of the civilians. The pretext of the chemical attack against Douma is a blatant lie used by Trump and other states who are in support of him to attack Syria. This vicious act won\u2019t change anything on the ground, as Syrian people who have been fighting terrorism for more than seven years a couple of rockets would not frighten us. They make us stronger and more adhered to our leadership. This aggression proves to us that the US has always been against us and the west is acting against the will of the Syrian people. It is an immoral act and for the interest of some other states. A few hours after the aggression, which last more than an hour, many demonstrations marched in Damascus to denounce the US aggression and support our leadership. Some of the protesters were holding parts of the rockets. Syrian president Bashar al-Assad has said this morning\u2019s missile strikes by the US, UK and France will only increase his country\u2019s resolve to fight terrorism during a phone conversation with Iranian president Hassan Rouhani. The Syrian leader accused western nations of supporting terrorism, and the Iranian president reaffirmed his country\u2019s commitment to the Syrian regime, according to the Syrian presidency. Earlier today, the Syrian Presidency\u2019s Twitter account posted a video of Assad arriving at work following the overnight raids. Here\u2019s the full text of Theresa May\u2019s speech on airstrikes in Syria: Labour and Conservative leaders in Scotland have reacted to the airstrikes. Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson said: Last night\u2019s airstrikes were targeted at the Syrian regime\u2019s chemical weapon facilities and in direct response to the chemical attack on Syria\u2019s civilian population in Douma last week. While carried out by UK, US and French military personnel, the strikes have the express support of the EU and Nato, as well as the governments of Canada, Australia and Germany, among others. The international community recognises that chemical weapons cannot be used with impunity, and that last night\u2019s targeted action will degrade the ability of the Assad regime to further develop and deploy chemical weapons in future. Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said: Just two days ago Theresa May met with her cabinet to discuss Syria \u2013 today we wake to the news that she has been led by Donald Trump into airstrikes, dangerously escalating an already devastating conflict. Despite having no majority, there has been no consultation with parliament on any military action, and no agreement with the UN. Political avenues should be exhausted before such a serious step is ever taken, yet the prime minister has been rushed into legally, morally and democratically questionable air strikes at the behest of Donald Trump. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) will continue its mission in Douma following reports of a chemical weapons attack, it has said. In a statement, the organisation said: The Fact-Finding Mission (FFM) team of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) will continue its deployment to the Syrian Arab Republic to establish facts around the allegations of chemical weapons use in Douma. The OPCW has been working in close collaboration with the United Nations department of safety and security to assess the situation and ensure the safety of the team. Syrian state TV shows people walking around a hole in the ground in a suburb of Homs said to be caused by the airstrikes carried out against Syria by the US, UK and France. Video here: Speaking in Yorkshire, Jeremy Corbyn said he would support calls for a new UN resolution and \u201cbring Russia and US together along with Iran, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Turkey, all the neighbouring states\u201d. This civil war is ghastly. It\u2019s killed hundreds of thousands. It\u2019s driven millions into refuge in other countries and the chemical weapons are obviously appalling and disgusting and completely illegal within international war. Asked about the consequences of taking action in Syria without legal authority, Corbyn said: The consequences of any country taking unilateral action that has no legal basis are that it\u2019s an encouragement for others to do exactly the same and reduces our ability to complain when others do that. Surely the United Nations exists for a purpose. If the security council was unable to come to an agreement this week, as it obviously wasn\u2019t because the US and Russia couldn\u2019t agree on anything, then surely the role of another country, us for example, is to be an honest broker and try and bring them together. This war cannot go on. Corbyn said weapons inspectors should have been allowed to complete their work. She (May) has used the argument that by bombing those sites it would prevent any other chemical weapons being used. I would just simply say to her the weapons inspectors were on their way to her to verify it. In 2013, Lavrov (Sergei, Russian foreign minister) and Kerry (John, former secretary of state) on behalf of Russia and US, reached an agreement, and did destroy a large amount of chemical weapons. There is precedent that this process can work. Surely it would be better to do that and start bombing, goodness knows, what the consequences of that bombing could be. I\u2019m glad that no service personnel were killed or injured during this we don\u2019t know if there were any civilian or other casualties yet. Asked how the airstrikes were illegal, Corbyn replied: You could only do it on the basis of self defence if there was a direct threat to us and there wasn\u2019t. The Russian military has claimed that the Syrian air defences, whose most modern weapon is a three-decades-old Russian-supplied anti-aircraft system, shot down 71 of 103 missiles fired by the US and its allies, the UK and France, Peter Beaumont and Andrew Roth write. As further details began to emerge about the sites target by the US-led strikes, Col Gen Sergei Rudskoi of the Russian military said the strikes had not caused any casualties and that Syrian military facilities targeted suffered only minor damage. Although it was not possible to verify the claims, the most up-to-date system that Moscow has supplied the Syrian regime is the short range Pantsir S-1, which has an anti-missile capability. Russia said its advisers had spent the last 18 months completely rebuilding the Syrian air defence system, and said the high number of intercepted rockets spoke to \u201cthe high effectiveness of the weaponry in Syria and the excellent training of Syrian servicemen prepared by our specialists\u201d. Although Russia suggested that Syrian forces had been responsible for manning their own air defences, Russian advisers have a long history of operating systems in such situations. Video footage that emerged in the aftermath of the strikes appeared to show air defence missiles being launched. Read more: The Stop the War Coalition has condemned the airstrikes. A statement released by the group said: We strongly condemn the missile attacks on Syria last night which will have only brought the Syrians more misery and destruction. They will have done nothing to end the war or alleviate their suffering. In sanctioning killing at the behest of Donald Trump, Theresa May deliberately avoided consulting parliament and risked dramatically widening the war. The overwhelming majority of people in this country oppose this action just as they have opposed the series of wars of the last seventeen years. Following protests around the country yesterday the Stop the War Coalition is calling for a further protest in Parliament Square this Monday 16 April the day parliament reconvenes. Theresa May has refused to rule out further action against targets in Syria if Britain sees further evidence of chemical weapons attacks, but faced down calls for an immediate vote in parliament on the British airstrikes overnight, writes Jessica Elgot. In Downing Street after military action was authorised in a joint offensive by the UK, US and France, the prime minister said the airstrikes would \u201csignificantly degrade the Syrian regime\u2019s ability to research, develop and deploy chemical weapons\u201d. The prime minister said the allies had hit a chemical weapons storage and production facility, a key chemical weapons research centre and a military bunker involved in chemical weapons attacks. However, pressed on whether she would authorise further strikes if chemical weapons stockpiles had survived, May said the Syrian regime should not doubt Britain\u2019s resolve to prevent the normalisation of chemical weapons. Amid accusations from Jeremy Corbyn that the attack was legally questionable, the prime minister said the attorney general, Jeremy Wright, had produced legal advice presented to cabinet on Thursday. Officials said it had made the case that strikes were necessary to prevent humanitarian catastrophe. May said she would return to the Commons on Monday when MPs return from the Easter recess to give a statement and answer questions about the attack. But pressed on whether she would grant MPs a vote if further action was taken, the prime minister declined to give any guarantees. \u201cThis decision was taken because I think it was the right thing to do,\u201d she said. \u201cThe power to take this decision is obviously a prerogative power and at the first opportunity, parliament will have an opportunity to question this. I will be in parliament on Monday in order to do so. The intent of this action is that it does degrade, and it does deter, the Syrian regime from taking action. We will be following up with further diplomatic action.\u201d In her statement to journalists on Saturday, the UK prime minister, Theresa May, gave examples of \u201cevidence\u201d that led UK authorities to conclude the Assad regime was behind the chemical weapons attack in Douma. Her comments add to information supplied by both the Pentagon in the US and an assessment released by France of what happened in Douma. May said: I cannot tell you everything. But let me give an example of some of the evidence that leads us to this conclusion. Open source accounts allege that a barrel bomb was used to deliver the chemicals. Multiple open source reports claim that a regime helicopter was observed above the city of Douma on the evening of 7 April. The opposition does not operate helicopters or use barrel bombs. And reliable intelligence indicates that Syrian military officials co-ordinated what appears to be the use of chlorine in Douma on 7 April. No other group could have carried out this attack. Indeed, Daesh for example does not even have a presence in Douma. France on Saturday released its assessment of what happened in the Syrian town of Douma on 7 April, saying it had \u201ca high level of confidence\u201d and enough proof to say the Syrian regime was behind chemical attacks. A French official said the assessment that had been released was based on declassified information and intelligence-gathering. The US has claimed it has a large body of evidence pointing to the Assad regime\u2019s responsibility for the 7 April chemical attack on Douma, including witness sightings of helicopters dropping barrel bombs on Douma, and reliable intelligence that Syrian military officials coordinated the attack. You can read more on US moves to provide evidence here: Theresa May said the airstrikes against Syria were \u201cright and legal\u201d - watch the video here. Caroline Lucas, the leader of the Green Party, has said air strikes will do \u201cnothing to increase chances of peace\u201d. The North Atlantic Council (NAC) - the principal political decision-making body of Nato - is to hold a meeting this afternoon to discuss the airstrikes. A Nato official: \u201cThere will be a meeting of the North Atlantic Council this afternoon. France, the United Kingdom and the United States will brief Allies on actions taken in Syria.\u201d Jens Stoltenberg, Nato secretary general, has said he supports the actions taken by US, UK and France. I support the actions taken by the United States, the United Kingdom and France against the Syrian regime\u2019s chemical weapons facilities and capabilities. This will reduce the regime\u2019s ability to further attack the people of Syria with chemical weapons. Nato has consistently condemned Syria\u2019s continued use of chemical weapons as a clear breach of international norms and agreements. The use of chemical weapons is unacceptable, and those responsible must be held accountable.NATO considers the use of chemical weapons as a threat to international peace and security, and believes that it is essential to protect the Chemical Weapons Convention. This calls for a collective and effective response by the international community. France on Saturday released its assessment of what happened in the Syrian town of Douma on April 7, saying it had \u201ca high level of confidence\u201d and enough proof to say the Syrian regime was behind chemical attacks. A French official said the assessment that had been released was based on declassified information and intelligence-gathering. The assessment cites \u201cthe absence at this point of chemical samples analysed by our own laboratories\u201d. The French official said samples could be analysed at a later time. The French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told French TV on Saturday that French services were analysing samples taken in Douma. Le Drian said: \u201cThere\u2019s chlorine, that\u2019s certain.\u201d Vince Cable, leader of the Liberal Democrats, said Theresa May should have sought Parliamentary approval for action. Riding the coattails of an erratic US President is no substitute for a mandate from the House of Commons. The Prime Minister could and should have recalled Parliament this week and sought the approval of MPs before proceeding. Liberal Democrats stood ready to assess the evidence and objectives for any action and, if it were properly planned and justified, to support a military response. At this moment our thoughts are with British and allied troops. But the Government\u2019s decision fatally undermines the integrity of this mission. It shows a weak Government putting short term political expediency before democracy and in so doing further diminishing the standing of Britain in the world. Guardian associate editor has written a comment piece on the Syrian airstrikes. He writes Enough to show they are serious. Not enough for it to get out of control. That, in essence, seems to be the initial lesson of the missile attacks launched on Syria this morning by the US, France and Britain. Read more: French defence ministry sources said France fired 12 missiles in coordinated air and sea strikes. First, cruise missiles were fired from frigates in the Mediterranean, and then, 20 minutes later missiles were fired from several French fighter jets which had taken off from airbases in France and were now back at base. The French naval vessels involved in the strikes have now left the area and headed west. The French operation lasted 10 hours. \u201cThe operation is over, the French aircraft are back,\u201d a French defence source said. The Democratic Unionist Party backed May\u2019s decision. Deputy leader and North Belfast MP Nigel Dodds MP said: \u201cFirst and foremost we salute the courage of our brave servicemen and women. They have carried out their duty with typical discipline and valour. \u201cThe Prime Minister has the full authority, on the basis of all the information at her disposal, to order the type of military action which has been carried out this morning and we reject any suggestion that she was not entitled to do so. \u201cWe are reassured that the military action is strictly targeted and limited in its purpose. Also that it is not about a wider intervention in the Syrian civil war which would, in our view, be counter productive. \u201cGiven the context of the recent international response to the use of a nerve agent in the UK, the clear targeed purpose of the strikes, and the repeated blocking by Russia of diplomatic solutions through the UN, we believe the Prime Minister was justified in standing with our American and French allies in this concerted action.\u201d Former UK prime minister, David Cameron, has declared his support for the airstrikes in Syria. The US has launched air strikes alongside UK and French forces aimed at reducing Syrian regime\u2019s chemical weapons facilities in the wake of last weekend\u2019s gas attack on the Damascus suburb of Douma. Moments after US president Donald Trump concluded his address on Friday night about 2am BST, reports emerged of explosions in Syria. A Pentagon briefing later confirmed three sites were hit: two in Damascus and one in Homs. The sites were all regarded as linked to the storage, or testing, of chemical weapons. Syrian air defences responded to the strikes but the US said it had suffered no losses in the initial air strikes. Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, said the airstrikes were an \u201cact of aggression\u201d and would worsen the humanitarian crisis in Syria. Trump said the attack in Douma a week ago represented \u201ca significant escalation in a pattern of chemical weapons use\u201d by the Assad regime. He said: \u201cWe are prepared to sustain this response until the Syrian regime stops its use of prohibited chemical agents.\u201d The British prime minister, Theresa May, said she authorised targeted strikes to \u201cdegrade the Syrian regime\u2019s chemical weapons capability and deter their use\u201d. Taking a swipe at Russia, she said: \u201cWe cannot allow the use of chemical weapons to become normalised \u2013 within Syria, on the streets of the UK, or anywhere else in our world. We would have preferred an alternative path. But on this occasion there is none.\u201d May addressed journalists at 10 Downing Street on Saturday morning, reiterating comments made in her statement. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has called the airstrikes \u201clegally questionable\u201d and said May should have sought parliamentary approval for the strikes. The UK\u2019s Ministry of Defence said four Tornado jets flew from Cyprus as part of the strikes on Homs. The UK defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, said the UK involvement has been successful. The US defence secretary, James Mattis, said the US, UK and France had taken \u201cdecisive action\u201d against Syria\u2019s chemical weapon infrastructure and did not rule out further strikes. \u201cClearly the Assad regime did not get the message\u201d last time, he said, referring to the response to the Ghouta chemical attack in 2017. He said the allies had \u201cgone to great length to avoid civil and foreign casualties\u201d. French president Emmanuel Macron said the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime posed an \u201cimmediate danger for the Syrian people and our collective security.\u201d The Spanish foreign ministry described the strikes as a \u201clegitimate and proportional\u201d response to the Syrian regime\u2019s use of chemical weapons against the civilian population. \u201cA chemical weapons attack is a crime against humanity,\u201d it said. \u201cThose responsible for this and previous attacks must be brought to justice. We regret the Security Council\u2019s paralysis on this issue. We always prefer concerted international action to unilateral action. But when the latter is taken, it must be proportional, as it has been on this occasion.\u201d In remarks apparently directed at the Russian government, the statement went on: \u201cThose who support the Syrian regime must exert all the necessary pressure to avoid attacks against the civilian population. The continuing violations of the ceasefire are not acceptable. But the use of chemical weapons is a qualitatively different issue and a matter of extreme gravity. Sadly this is not the first time but we hope it will be the last.\u201d The Spanish government said that only a UN-supervised political transition would bring peace to Syria: \u201cSpain wholeheartedly supports that transition as the only way to put an end to the images we have seen over recent days of children dying amid atrocious suffering. Nothing can justify something like that.\u201d Israel has said the strikes were an \u201cimportant signal\u201d to Iran, Syria and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. \u201cThe use of chemical weapons crosses a red line that humanity can no longer tolerate,\u201d Yoav Gallant, a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s security cabinet, said on Twitter. \u201cThe American attack is an important signal to the axis of evil - Iran, Syria and Hezbollah,\u201d he added. There have been concerns expressed among high-level security figures in Israel that the country could be targetted by Iran, Syria or Iran\u2019s proxy, Hezbollah, following US strikes. As May was speaking, European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker has issued a statement in which he says the use of chemical weapons is \u201cunacceptable in any circumstances\u201d. Last night, France, the United Kingdom and the United States responded in a coordinated military action to the heinous chemical weapons attack carried out by the Syrian regime against civilians in Douma on 7 April. As the European Commission has stated, the use of chemical weapons is unacceptable in any circumstances and must be condemned in the strongest terms. The international community has the responsibility to identify and hold accountable those responsible of any attack with chemical weapons. This was not the first time that the Syrian regime has used chemical weapons against civilians but it must be the last. As it enters its 8th year of conflict, Syria desperately needs a lasting ceasefire respected by all parties that paves the way for achieving a negotiated political solution through the United Nations-led Geneva process, to bring peace to the country once and for all. After the suffering they have endured, Syrians deserve nothing less. Pressed on the role of Parliament and future votes on further military action, May said she thought the action was \u201cthe right thing to do\u201d and was about \u201cdegradation of chemical weapons\u201d. Asked if the current scenario shows the vote in 2013 to take no action against Syria was a mistake, she said: \u201cI voted to take action in 2013. When the Government put that to Parliament we felt it was the right thing to do.\u201d She said promises were made by the Syrian regime at the time which were subsequently not kept. Asked why UK did not wait \u201cone or two days\u201d for formal proof from chemical weapons investigators, May said the recent attack in Douma was not the only one that has taken place. The reason for UK action was not just the events in Douma but also earlier attacks. \u201cAll the indications were this was a chemical weapons attack at the hands of the Syrian regime,\u201d she said. Given the failure of all diplomatic efforts so far, what is the plan following these strikes? May says diplomatic efforts so far have not had \u201cthe impact we wish it would have\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve now taken military action and alongside that we will renew diplomatic efforts as well,\u201d she adds. Asked if UK spoke to Russia before the strikes took place, May said it did not. Asked by the Guardian\u2019s Jessica Elgot if she is concerned that she may not have the support of the British people, May replied: \u201cMy message to people is this is about the use of chemical weapons. We\u2019ve had an accepted position in the international community - chemical weapons are illegal, they are banned - we\u2019ve seen that international norm eroded.\u201d May said a nerve agenet has been used on UK streets and the Syrian regime have continued to use chemical weapons despite reassurances they did not have any. \u201cIt is important for the alleviation of humanitarian suffering in Syria but also if we stand back and look at this more widely it\u2019s in all our interests that we restore that international norm on the prohibition of chemical weapons.\u201d Following her comments related to the attack in Salisbury, May was asked if the airstrikes were just about Assad or a warning to Russia as well. She said: \u201cThe action taken last night was focused on degrading and deterring the operational capability and wilingness of the Syrian regime to use chemical weapons.\u201d But she added: \u201cI believe it is a message to others that the international community is not going to stand by and see chemical weapons used with immunity.\u201d Asked why she did not seek prior approval or debate? \u201cI believe this action was necessary, it was the right thing for us to do. We\u2019ve been working with our allies and partners to make a full assessment of what happened on the ground, then to consider what action was necessary. Then to do that in a timely fashion. \u201cOne of the gravest decisions a prime minister can take is to send our service personnel into action, into combat. We owe it to them we protect their safety and security.\u201d May said the attacks were \u201cright and legal\u201d. She said: \u201cThe lesson of history is when the global rules and standard that keep us safe come under threat we must take a stand and defend them. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve always done and will continue to do.\u201d \u201cThe use of a nerve agent in the UK in recent weeks is part of a pattern of disregard for these norms,\u201d May says. \u201cIt will send a clear signal to anyone else who believes they can use chemical weapons with immunity.\u201d May says the military action would alleviate further suffering. \u201cIt was not about regime change,\u201d May says. \u201cIt was a limited, targeted, effective strike with clear boundaries.\u201d The strikes will degrade ability to research, develop and deploy chemical weapons, she says. \u201cLast night\u2019s strikes by US, UK and France were significantly larger than the US action a year ago, and designed to have greater impact on regime\u2019s capability and willingness to use chemical weapons.\u201d UK will not \u201cstand by and tolerate use of chemical weapons\u201d, she says. May says the UK Government has attempted to approach Syria through diplomatic channels but to no avail. \u201cThe UK Government has been working intensively with international partners to build evidence picture\u201d, she says. May says the fact of the chemical weapon attack in Douma \u201cshould surprise no one\u201d. We know the Syrian regime has an abhorrent record of using chemical weapons against its own people. No other group could have carried out this attack. Daesh does not have a presence in Douma. Theresa May is making a statement at Downing Street on the US-led airstrikes in Syria. She said full assessments of the UK airstrike are taking place but Government is \u201cconfident of its success\u201d. Here\u2019s more from our Moscow correspondent, Andrew Roth, on Putin\u2019s statement. Vladimir Putin said that the US-led strike would \u201cworsen the humanitarian catastrophe in Syria\u201d. The attack would \u201cbring suffering to the peaceful population, in effect pander to the terrorists who have tormented the Syrian people for seven years, and provoke a new wave of refugees\u201d from the country, the Russian president said. The attack would \u201chave a destructive effect on the entire system of international relations\u201d, he added. Putin also repeated Russian insistences that the country had found no evidence of the chemical weapons attack in the Damascus suburb of Douma that led to Saturday morning\u2019s airstrikes. \u201cRussian military experts at the place of the alleged incident did not find any signs of the use of chlorine or other poisonous substances. Not one local resident confirmed the fact of a chemical attack,\u201d Putin said in the statement released by the Kremlin. Putin also attack the US-led coalition for carrying out the strike \u201cwithout waiting for the results of the investigation\u201d, referring to a fact finding mission of experts from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons bound for Douma. The Candian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has offered his support to the actions taken by US, UK and France. In a statement he said: Canada condemns in the strongest possible terms the use of chemical weapons in last week\u2019s attack in eastern Ghouta, Syria. Canada supports the decision by the United States, the United Kingdom, and France to take action to degrade the Assad regime\u2019s ability to launch chemical weapons attacks against its own people. We will continue to work with our international partners to further investigate the use of chemical weapons in Syria. Those responsible must be brought to justice. At the Elys\u00e9e palace, where diplomatic and military staff had been awake all night, the focus was on stressing that French president Emmanuel Macron\u2019s clearly stated \u201cred-line\u201d on chemical weapons use in Syria had been overstepped, as well as international treaties on chemical weapons, and that the French action was legal, \u201cproportional and targeted\u201d. Sources at the Elys\u00e9e emphasised Macron\u2019s diplomatic efforts yesterday \u2014 describing his phone conversation with the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, as key. Macron was the only leader of the US, UK, French coalition to speak directly to Putin on Friday as airstrikes were being prepared. The Elys\u00e9e said the conversation was aimed at looking beyond military action and pushing for more joint work towards a political solution in Syria, stressing that Paris, in targeting strikes specifically at the Syrian regime\u2019s chemical weapons development and production, had sought to avoid any form of escalation with allies. One Elys\u00e9e source said of Macron and Putin\u2019s conversation: \u201cThe tone was direct as it often is, but it was already constructive.\u201d Paris is seeking to very quickly try to capitalise on the momentum of the weekend\u2019s strikes to push for humanitarian corridors and to push for a \u201cpolitical process\u201d for Syria, to see if Russia will come to the table on political transition, sources said. Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the Labour Party, has responding to the Syria airstrikes, calling them \u201clegally questionable\u201d: Bombs won\u2019t save lives or bring about peace. This legally questionable action risks escalating further, as US defence secretary James Mattis has admitted, an already devastating conflict and therefore makes real accountability for war crimes and use of chemical weapons less, not more likely. Britain should be playing a leadership role to bring about a ceasefire in the conflict, not taking instructions from Washington and putting British military personnel in harm\u2019s way. Theresa May should have sought parliamentary approval, not trailed after Donald Trump. The Government should do whatever possible to push Russia and the United States to agree to an independent UN-led investigation of last weekend\u2019s horrific chemical weapons attack so that those responsible can be held to account. Russian President Vladimir Putin in a statement called the US-led airstrikes against Syria an \u201cact of aggression.\u201d Putin said that Russia would convene an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council to discuss the \u201caggressive actions of the United States and its allies.\u201d Russia in \u201cthe most serious way condemns the attack on Syria, where Russian servicemen are helping the legitimate government in its fight with terrorism\u201d, the statement said, according to reports from Russian news agencies. Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, a staunch ally of Bashar al-Assad, condemned Saturday\u2019s US-led airstrikes on Syria, describing the leaders of the three countries involved in the attack as criminals. \u201cI clearly declare that the US president, the French president and the UK prime minister are criminals and have committed a crime,\u201d he said on Saturday, state agencies reported. Tehran\u2019s foreign ministry also said in a statement that \u201cthe aggression is a flagrant violation of international law and a disregard of Syria\u2019s right to national sovereignty and territorial integrity,\u201d Iranian media reported. \u201cBased on religious, legal and ethical regulations, Iran opposes any use of chemical weapons, but at the same time, strongly rejects and condemns the fabrication of excuses to invade an independent country,\u201d the foreign ministry\u2019s statement said. \u201cThere is no doubt that the US and its allies that are engaged a military intervention in Syria without any substantiated document and before any final report of the Organization for Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), and have supposed themselves as the world police and judge, are responsible for regional and international repercussions of the adventure, and should be held accountable,\u201d he said. Iran, which has been propping up Assad since the conflict began, has provided the Syrian government with crucial ground support, thanks to a combination of Hezbollah fighters, Shia volunteers from across the Middle East and its own Revolutionary Guards. Russian and Iranian backing has swung the conflict in Assad\u2019s favour, at the same time as the so-called caliphate of the Islamic State (Isis) has crumbled. Its remaining fighters have been pushed back to a modest piece of land along the Euphrates valley near the Iraqi border. The post-Isis era has also changed the dynamic of the war, however, and Israel, which is concerned about Iran\u2019s growing influence on its doorstep, has become more involved militarily. An Israeli airstrike on a Syrian airbase near Homs on Sunday killed at least seven Iranian military personnel in an incident that Tehran vowed would not be left unanswered. Khamenei\u2019s top adviser on foreign policy, Ali Akbar Velayati, met with Assad in Damascus ahead of the airstrikes, reiterating Tehran\u2019s support, saying that Iran will stand by the Syrian government under any circumstances in defiance of western retaliation. Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon says UK foreign policy should be set by parliament and not Donald Trump following the missile strikes launched by the US, UK and France against Syria. She said the suspected use of chemical weapons in Douma last week was \u201csickening\u201d but warned that the latest action risked \u201cdangerous escalation\u201d. Asked how the prime minister would address MPs\u2019 concerns when she returns to Parliament on Monday, Williamson said: He said: \u201cThe speed in which we\u2019re acting is essential. We\u2019ve been co-operating with our partners to alleviate further humanitarian suffering and to maintain the vital security of our operations.\u201d He went on: \u201cAs you\u2019ve touched upon the prime minister will be going to Parliament on Monday. She quite rightly has been taking a leadership role. She said the use of chemical weapons is completely wrong. We\u2019ve had to take action in order to stop this and reduce the Syrian government\u2019s ability to take further action.\u201d He said: \u201cThe prime minister and government have to make decisions not only to do what is right in terms or protecting innocent people but also protecting our national security. We have to make those decisions, and quite understandably, Parliament holds government to account for decisions its makes. \u201cBut it is about doing the right thing, it is about actually protecting those innocent people that the Assad regime have so little care for and are quite comfortable in terms of using chemical weapons against them. \u201cIt\u2019s just frankly not right and we have to take action to stop that happening in the future and that\u2019s what we did last night.\u201d Asked if this was a \u201cone-time shot\u201d, as US defence secretary, James Mattis, has said, Williamson replied: \u201cWe\u2019ve been working to make sure the targeting and the strikes have an enormous effect. It\u2019s our belief the action we\u2019ve taken has degraded their ability to act in the future.\u201d Pressed on the issue, Williamson said a clear message had been sent to the Syrian regime and it was now \u201cin their hands\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s the Syrian regime choice - do they think it\u2019s acceptable to use chemical weapons? There is a consequence.\u201d Williamson said the action taken by UK, US and France \u201csignificantly reduced\u201d the likelihood of the regime using them again. Williamson said the decision to launch airstrikes was discussed at a Cabinet meeting on Thursday. \u201cWe all saw the images of the suffering inflicted on innocent men women and children,\u201d he said. Asked if the intervention could bring about change in the direction of the Syrian civil war, he said: \u201cWe expect it to have a significant effect to stop the Syrian regime using chemical weapons in the future.\u201d Defence secretary Gavin Williamson is speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. He says four RAF tornados took part in strikes on targets in Syria and initial assessments suggest it was a \u201chighly successful mission\u201d. Over in Cyprus, British base officials are saying they will not be commenting on the overnight strikes in which four Royal Air Force Tornados GR4s were involved. Speaking shortly after four RAF tornados launched Storm Shadow missiles at a Syrian chemical weapons base 15 miles west of Homs, a British base spokesman in Cyprus said there would be no further information on the attack from officials on the island. \u201cI am sorry to disappoint but there will be no facilities here on Cyprus,\u201d Sean Tully, spokesman for the sovereign base area, told the Guardian. \u201cWe will not be holding press conferences and journalists will not be allowed onto the [military] base.\u201d Any information regarding the strike - and possible Russian retaliation \u2013 will be divulged from London. \u201cThe ministry of defence will be coordinating. All enquiries must be directed to them.\u201d RAF Akrotiri, the nearest airbase to Syria, is Britain\u2019s main forward mounting base for overseas operations in the Middle East and has long been used to carry out precision air strikes on Islamic State targets in Syria and Iraq. A former colony Cyprus is host to two British sovereign bases. Eight typhoon and six tornado fighter bombers are stationed at RAF Akrotiri. Prior to the overnight strikes, speculation was rife that the airbase\u2019s frontline role as a launch pad would make it a prime candidate for counter attack if Moscow followed through on its pledge to retaliate against any armed action in Syria. Ahead of the strikes defensive measures were believed to have been taken at the airbase. I\u2019m handing over now to my colleague Jamie Grierson in London. The Guardian\u2019s Middle East reporter Kareem Shaheen is reporting on regional reaction to the air strikes. More international reaction coming in, with Turkey saying it welcomed the attacks this morning as an appropriate measure for the use of chemical weapons. \u201cWe welcome this operation which has eased humanity\u2019s conscience in the face of the attack in Douma, largely suspected to have been carried out by the regime,\u201d the foreign ministry said in a statement on the state-run Anadolu Agency. \u201cAttacks with weapons of mass destruction, including chemical weapons, that indiscriminately target civilians constitute crimes against humanity. \u201cThe Syrian regime, which has been tyrannising its own people for more than seven years, be it with conventional or chemical weapons, has a proven track record of crimes against humanity and war crimes. The conscience of the international community carries no doubt to that effect.\u201d Bashar al-Assad arrives at work on a morning of steadfastness. The Guardian\u2019s Middle East reporter Kareem Shaheen on a statement issued by the Syrian military command: The statement published by the Syrian state news agency says the \u201ctripartite aggression\u201d began at 3:55am Damascus time and included approximately 110 missiles fired at targets inside Syria. It said that Syrian air defence responded and brought down the majority of the missiles, but some hit a research facility in Barzeh, which it said contained scientific labs and an educational centre, but that the US claims was a chemical weapons research facility. The statement also said that other missiles targeting a military installation near Homs were disrupted and exploded, injuring three civilians, the first allegation of civilian casualties from the strike. The statement says the Syrian military will continue to fight against \u201cterrorism\u201d. The Associated Press is reporting protests on the streets of Damascus this morning in a show of defiance against the US: Hundreds of Syrians gathered at landmark squares in the Syrian capital Saturday, honking their car horns, flashing victory signs and waving Syrian flags in scenes of defiance that followed unprecedented joint airstrikes by the United States, France and Britain. \u201cGood souls will not be humiliated,\u201d Syria\u2019s presidency tweeted after the airstrikes began. Soon after the one-hour attack ended, vehicles with loudspeakers roamed the streets of Damascus blaring nationalist songs. Hundreds of residents began gathering in the landmark Omayyad square of the Syrian capital. Many waved Syrian, Russian and Iranian flags. Some clapped their hands and danced, other drove in convoys, honking their horns in defiance. \u201cWe are your men, Bashar,\u201d they shouted. Syrian state TV broadcast live from the square where a large crowd of civilians mixed with men in uniforms, including an actor, lawmakers and other figures. \u201cGood morning steadfastness,\u201d one broadcaster said. Syrian TV called the attacks a \u201cblatant violation of international law and shows contempt for international legitimacy.\u201d Russia\u2019s defence ministry has issued a statement saying \u201cmore than 100 cruise missiles and air-to-land missiles were fired by the US, Britain, and France from the sea and air at Syrian military and civilian targets\u201d. The statement said \u201ca significant number\u201d of missiles were shot down by Syrian air defences, built by the Soviet Union more than 30 years ago. No Russian air defences based in Syria were hit in the strikes, the ministry said. Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau has said his government (another Five Eyes member) supports the attacks on Syrian military targets. Canada supports the decision by the United States, the United Kingdom, and France to take action to degrade the Assad regime\u2019s ability to launch chemical weapons attacks against its own people. We will continue to work with our international partners to further investigate the use of chemical weapons in Syria. Those responsible must be brought to justice.\u200e Donald Trump has launched air strikes alongside UK and French forces aimed at reducing Syrian regime\u2019s chemical weapons facilities in the wake of last weekend\u2019s gas attack on the Damascus suburb of Douma. Moments after the president\u2019s address finished, reports emerged of explosions in Damascus. A Pentagon briefing later confirmed three sites were hit: two in Damascus and one in Homs. The sites were all regarded as linked to the storage, or testing, of chemical weapons. Syrian air defences responded to the strikes but the US said it had suffered no losses in the initial air strikes. Anatoly Antonov, the Russian ambassador to the US, said \u201csuch actions will not be left without consequences\u201d and said Moscow was being threatened. \u201cInsulting the president of Russia is unacceptable and inadmissible,\u201d he added. The US president said the attack in Douma a week ago represented \u201ca significant escalation in a pattern of chemical weapons use\u201d by the Assad regime. He said: \u201cWe are prepared to sustain this response until the Syrian regime stops its use of prohibited chemical agents.\u201d The British prime minister, Theresa May, said she authorised targeted strikes to \u201cdegrade the Syrian regime\u2019s chemical weapons capability and deter their use\u201d. Taking a swipe at Russia, she said: \u201cWe cannot allow the use of chemical weapons to become normalised \u2013 within Syria, on the streets of the UK, or anywhere else in our world. We would have preferred an alternative path. But on this occasion there is none.\u201d The UK\u2019s Ministry of Defence said four Tornado jets flew from Cyprus as part of the strikes on Homs. US defence secretary, James Mattis, said the US, UK and France had taken \u201cdecisive action\u201d against Syria\u2019s chemical weapon infrastructure and did not rule out further strikes. \u201cClearly the Assad regime did not get the message\u201d last time, he said, referring to the response to the Ghouta chemical attack in 2017. He said the allies had \u201cgone to great length to avoid civil and foreign casualties\u201d. French president Emmanuel Macron said the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime posed an \u201cimmediate danger for the Syrian people and our collective security.\u201d Julian Borger is reporting from Washington that the US relied on a \u201clarge body\u201d of evidence pointing towards the Assad regime\u2019s responsibility for the chemical weapons attack on Douma. The evidence includes eyewitness accounts of helicopters dropping barrel bombs on the city, and \u201creliable intelligence\u2019 that the attacks were co-ordinated by Syrian military officials. Jenny Jones, Greens peer Iran has warned of \u201cregional consequences\u201d following air strikes in Syria by a coalition of the United States, Britain, and France. \u201cThe United States and its allies have no proof and, without even waiting for the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to take a position, have carried out this military attack,\u201d Iran\u2019s foreign ministry in a statement. The coalition will be \u201cresponsible for the regional consequences of this adventurist action\u201d. Iran is a key backer - alongside Russia - of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, providing military advisors and \u201cvolunteer\u201d ground forces. Tehran officials have said the Western powers were using last week\u2019s alleged chemical attack on the rebel-held stronghold of Douma as an excuse to undermine the Syrian regime\u2019s recent advances in the long-running civil war. Seven Iranians were killed in an air strike on a Syrian military base on Monday, which Iran claims was carried out by Israel. The Guardian\u2019s Paris correspondent Angelique Chrisafis: Protestors on the streets of Damascus wave Russian and Syrian flags, the morning after US-led airstrikes on the capital. Russia\u2019s foreign ministry Maria Zakharova has condemned the US over its strikes on Syria. She said the attacks hit a long-troubled country \u201cthat for many years has been trying to survive terrorist aggression\u201d. In a statement posted to Facebook on Saturday, Zakharova also criticised the Western media for its coverage, which it says informed the White House for its attacks. \u201cThe White House stated that its assuredness of the chemical attack from Damascus was based on \u2018mass media, reports of symptoms, video, photos as well as credible information\u2019. After this statement the American and other Western mass media should understand their responsibility in what is happening.\u201d Zakharova compared the situation to the start of the Iraq War in 2003 based on claims Iraq was developing weapons of mass destruction. Syrian state-run TV is reporting that three civilians have been wounded in the US-led missile attack on a military base in Homs. Reports say the attack was largely thwarted by the derailing of incoming missiles but add that nonetheless, three people were wounded. The TV network says a separate attack of \u201ca number of missiles\u201d - targeting a scientific research centre - destroyed a building and caused other material damage but no human losses. The network said the building in the research centre included an education centre and other laboratories. Theresa May has spoken from No. 10 on the air strikes in Syria, drawing a direct link between the strikes and the alleged Russian nerve agent attacks in Salisbury last month. We cannot allow the use of chemical weapons to become normalised: within Syria, on the streets of the UK, or anywhere else in our world. We would have preferred an alternative path, but on this occasion there is none. The Guardian\u2019s Middle East reporter Kareem Shaheen: This is a video purporting to be from Damascus showing Syrian air defense firing at incoming missiles with the dawn call to prayer in the city in the background. The Syrian government will likely portray the attack as showing Syria\u2019s steadfastness against foreign aggression, handing a win to the Assad regime. As mentioned earlier, Syrian state TV is already calling the attack the \u2018tripartite aggression\u2019, drawing a parallel to the Suez canal campaign in 1956 against Egypt, an evocative Arab nationalist moment. The Syrian government is confirming that one of the attacks hit a scientific research facility in Barzeh near Damascus, which they said destroyed an education center and scientific laboratories but didn\u2019t cause any casualties. Its description would correspond with what the US says is a chemical weapons research facility. It is morning in Damascus. State television is broadcasting pictures of the city, showing heavy traffic, in a bid to demonstrate an apparently unperturbed city. US-led airstrikes on Syria targeted sites in the capital Damascus, and in Homs. Reports are emerging from Damascus, with the Syrian government saying it was able to \u201cabsorb\u201d the US-led airstrikes on the capital and Homs, thanks to a warning from Russia. Syria says it was able to shoot down a third of the 30 missiles fired upon its territory. The US said it gave Russia warning of the impending strikes but did not reveal any detail about targets. Reuters is reporting: The Syrian government and its allies have absorbed a U.S.-led attack on Saturday and the targeted sites were evacuated days ago thanks to a warning from Russia, a senior official in a regional alliance that backs Damascus said. \u201cWe have absorbed the strike\u201d, the official told Reuters. \u201cWe had an early warning of the strike from the Russians ... and all military bases were evacuated a few days ago,\u201d the official said. Around 30 missiles were fired in the attack, and a third of them were shot down, the official said. \u201cWe are carrying out an assessment of the material damages,\u201d the official added. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has been backed in the seven-year-long Syrian war by Russia, Iran, and Iran-backed Shi\u2019ite groups from across the region, including Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah. Ewen MacAskill has written analysis of the military strikes. He says the US-led action carries risk, \u2018but it\u2019s not World War Three\u2019. It is intended as a one-off, with no further strikes planned unless Syrian president Bashar al-Assad conducts chemical attacks in the future. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders and National Security Advisor John Bolton watch President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement of military strikes on Syria. Bolton has been in the job five days. There are reports Bolton urged the president to conduct far larger military strikes than the more limited action counselled by secretary of defence Jim Mattis. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said the US operation was \u201crobust\u201d and \u201cclearly well-considered\u201d. \u201cTonight, the administration notified me of the president\u2019s decision to use military action to deter Bashar al-Assad and respond to the Syrian regime\u2019s use of chemical weapons against its own people. I support both the action and objective.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Middle East reporter Kareem Shaheen is reporting on the sites hit by US-led air strikes. A rebel official in the Qalamoun mountains, an area in the province of Damascus, said their fighters reported attacks near the town of al-Ruhaybah, as well as the Dumayr air base. Rebels in the area reported hearing and seeing the explosions in the areas. The official said the first target is believed to be a storage facility for ballistic missile fuel, and may have been used for storing chemicals. Dumayr air base is believed to be the installation from which the helicopters that carried out the Douma chemical attack took off. They also reported that the Syrian government launched missiles from its air defense system but apparently to no effect. Amnesty International US has urged the American military and its allies to minimise civilian casualties in all of its strikes against Syria. \u201cThe people of Syria have already endured six years of devastating attacks, including chemical attacks, many of which amount to war crimes,\u201d Raed Jarrar, advocacy director for Middle East-North Africa said. \u201cAll precautions must be taken to minimise harm to civilians in any military action. People already living in fear of losing their lives in unlawful attacks must not be further punished for the alleged violations of the Syrian government.\u201d Jarrar said the US must also consider the broader repercussions of continued conflict in Syria, with millions having already fled violence and persecution in the country. \u201cThe Trump administration must not turn its back on the suffering of men, women, and children by continuing to ban refugees from entering the United States. It is time for the US to reopen our doors to people trying to escape from the violence in Syria.\u201d Amnesty International is one of 45 NGOs that have signed a joint statement urging UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to launch an independent UN investigation to identify those responsible for chemical attacks in Syria. I will now hand you over to my colleague Ben Doherty for continued coverage of events in Syria. Donald Trump has launched air strikes alongside UK and French forces aimed at the Syrian regime\u2019s chemical weapons facilities. Moments after the president\u2019s address finished, reports emerged of explosions in Damascus. A Pentagon briefing later confirmed three sites were hit in Damascus and Homs. Syrian air defences responded but the US said it has suffered no losses in the initial air strikes. Anatoly Antonov, the Russian ambassador to the US, said \u201csuch actions will not be left without consequences\u201d and said Moscow was being threatened. \u201cInsulting the president of Russia is unacceptable and inadmissible,\u201d he added. The US president said the attack in Douma a week ago represented \u201ca significant escalation in a pattern of chemical weapons use\u201d by the Assad regime. He said: \u201cWe are prepared to sustain this response until the Syrian regime stops its use of prohibited chemical agents.\u201d The British prime minister, Theresa May, said she authorised targeted strikes to \u201cdegrade the Syrian regime\u2019s chemical weapons capability and deter their use\u201d.

He said the allies had \u201cgone to great length to avoid civil and foreign casualties\u201d. French president Emmanuel Macron said the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime posed an \u201cimmediate danger for the Syrian people and our collective security.\u201d The French presidential palace has released footage of its military jets setting off. John McCain, a Trump foe and chairman of the Senate armed services committee, has applauded the president for taking military action \u201cand for signalling his resolve to do so again if these heinous attacks continue\u201d. He says: \u201cThe message to Assad must be that the cost of using chemical weapons is worse than any perceived benefit, that the United States and our allies have the will and capability to continue imposing those costs, and that Iran and Russia will ultimately be unsuccessful in protecting Assad from our punitive response.\u201d However, he urges famously impulsive Trump to put together a comprehensive strategy for the region in order to succeed in the long run. He says air strikes alone will not achieve US objectives in the Middle East. A rebel official in the Qalamoun mountains, an area in the province of Damascus, said their fighters reported attacks near the town of al-Ruhaybah, as well as the Dumayr air base. Rebels in the area reported hearing and seeing the explosions there. Dumayr air base is believed to be the installation from which the helicopters that carried out the Douma chemical attack took off. It is believed to be a storage facility for ballistic missile fuel, and might have been used for storing chemicals, the official said. Rebels reported that the Syrian government launched missiles from its air defence system but apparently to no effect. Anatoly Antonov, the Russian ambassador to the US, has responded to the air strikes in Damascus and Homs. He says Moscows warnings have been left unheard and that Russia is being threatened. \u201cWe warned that such actions will not be left without consequences,\u201d he says. He says \u201cinsulting the president of Russia is unacceptable and inadmissible\u201d and that the US, as a holder of chemical weapons, has no moral right to blame other countries. This from Associated Press Middle East correspondent Bassem Mroue. Australia, a staunch ally of the US and a member of the Five Eyes security alliance, was not a part of the air strikes on Syria, but has issued a statement supporting the coalition\u2019s actions. The Guardian understands the Australian government was briefed by the US on the strikes shortly before they began. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, along with the foreign and defence ministers, issued a statement: Australia supports these strikes, which demonstrate a calibrated, proportionate and targeted response. They send an unequivocal message to the Assad regime and its backers, Russia and Iran, that the use of chemical weapons will not be tolerated. The use of chemical weapons by anyone, anywhere, under any circumstances is illegal and utterly reprehensible. The Assad regime must not be allowed to commit such crimes with impunity. Australia also said Syria\u2019s allies, Russia and Iran, must pressure the Assad regime to abandon its practice of using chemical weapons. Syrian media has reported that Syrian defences hit 13 rockets south of Damascus. It said vehicles with loudspeakers later emerged on the streets of Damascus blaring nationalist songs. Some more detail on the recent Pentagon briefing conducted by US defence secretary James Mattis. He said there were no reports yet of any US losses during the initial airstrikes. He said \u201cright now this is a one-time shot\u201d but did not rule out further attacks. Donald Trump said earlier that the campaign against Bashar al-Assad could be \u201csustained\u201d. France\u2019s president Emannuel Macron said he acted because \u201ca red line has been crossed\u201d. The Pentagon briefing has now wrapped up and I will get you more detailed information on that shortly. Circling back to the UK\u2019s involvement, Gavin Williamson, the UK defence secretary, said: \u201cThe reprehensible use of chemical weapons in Douma is further evidence of the Syrian regime\u2019s appalling cruelty against its own people. We will not stand by whilst innocent civilians, including women and children, are killed and made to suffer. \u201cThe international community has responded decisively with legal and proportionate military force. Let these united actions send a clear message to the regime \u2013 the use of chemical weapons is categorically unacceptable and you will be held to account.\u201d Here is the full text of Donald Trump\u2019s earlier announcement of strikes against the Syrian regime\u2019s chemical weapons capability. In it, he says the attack a week ago on Douma \u201cwas a significant escalation in a pattern of chemical weapons use by that very terrible regime\u201d. He adds: \u201cThe purpose of our actions tonight is to establish a strong deterrent against the production, spread, and use of chemical weapons.\u201d \u201cI also have a message tonight for the two governments most responsible for supporting, equipping, and financing the criminal Assad regime. \u201cTo Iran, and to Russia, I ask: What kind of a nation wants to be associated with the mass murder of innocent men, women, and children?\u201d Mattis is still answering detailed questions. He says he is confident a chemical weapon was used, possibly sarin. Our wrap on the UK involvement in the Syrian strikes is up now. In a statement, prime minister Theresa May said it was not a decision she had taken lightly. In a thinly veiled swipe at Russia, and the Skripals poisoning, she said: \u201cWe cannot allow the use of chemical weapons to become normalised \u2013 within Syria, on the streets of the UK, or anywhere else in our world. We would have preferred an alternative path. But on this occasion there is none.\u201d France, the third partner in these strikes, has issued a statement. President Emmanuel Macron said the attack would be limited to Syria\u2019s chemical weapons facilities. \u201cWe cannot tolerate the recurring use of chemical weapons, which is an immediate danger for the Syrian people and our collective security,\u201d a statement said. Mattis: \u201cWe did everything we could to minimise any chance of civilian casualties. We are aware this is very difficult.\u201d Mattis is asked when he was confident a chemical attack happened. He says yesterday. Dunford is taking questions now, and says the Russians were not previously notified of the targets. Dunford makes the point that last time the US conducted an airstrike \u2013 following a chemical attack in Ghouta \u2013 it was a unilateral action. This time, two allies \u2013 the Uk and France \u2013 were involved. Mattis passes over to General Dunford. He says three sites have been hit. The first target was a science research facility in the greater Damascus area. The second was a storage facility west of Homs they believe held precursor chemicals and sarin. The third was a chemical storage depot and \u201cimportant command post\u201d. Mattis says the strikes were directed at the Syrian regime and that the military had \u201cgone to great length to avoid civil and foreign casualties\u201d. Mattis said the US, UK and France took \u201cdecisive action\u201d chemical weapon infrastructure. \u201cClearly the Assad regime did not get the message,\u201d he said and that with US allies a clear message had been sent not to perpetrate another attack. James Mattis, the US defence secretary, is speaking now. The MoD said the strike in Homs was designed to \u201cmaximise the destruction of the stockpiled chemicals and to minimise any risks of contamination to the surrounding area\u201d. It said the facility is \u201csome distance\u201d from any known concentrations of civilian habitation. It said initial indications showed the attack was successful. The UK\u2019s Ministry of Defence has given details of its involvement in tonight\u2019s strikes. It says four RAF Tornados flew from Cyprus and fired Storm Shadow missiles at a former missile base in Syria, near Homs, where the Syrian government was believed to have kept chemical weapon precursors. We have a wrap of what we know so far, by Julian Borger, our world affairs editor, here. Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader has issued a strong rebuke of Trump for his actions, saying\u201d \u201cOne night of airstrikes is not a substitute for a clear, comprehensive Syria strategy.\u201d She said the the president must come to Congress and secure authorisation for use of military force, while also holding \u201cPutin accountable for his enabling of the Assad regime\u2019s atrocities against the Syrian people.\u201d Further explosions are being heard in Damascus. CNN is quoting a senior administration official saying \u201cthis isn\u2019t over\u201d and that tonight is just the first wave of a \u201cmulti-wave\u201d attack. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says several military bases have also been hit. It says the Republican Guard headquarters and the army\u2019s 4th division were targeted. Some more detail on the situation in Damascus. A Reuters witness has said at least six loud explosions were heard in the city and smoke was seen rising. Syrian state TV has said the army\u2019s air defences were confronting an attack by the United States, France and Britain. A second witness said the Barzah district of Damascus had been hit in the strikes. Barzah is the location of a major Syrian scientific research centre. Worth noting that staff from the UN\u2019s Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons were due to visit Damascus on Saturday to determine whether chemical weapons were used in Douma on 7 April. Trump\u2019s decision comes on a day of rapid developments: The Russian defence minister, Maj Gen Igor Konashenkov, claimed to have direct evidence that Britain had orchestrated the alleged chemical attack at Douma in Syria. The UK, he said, was \u201cdirectly involved in the provocation\u201d. The White House said it had \u201ca high level of confidence\u201d that the Syrian regime carried out the chemical weapon attack in Douma. The US, UK and France continued to build up military resources in the eastern Mediterranean. The US is using Tomahawk cruise missiles in its strikes in Syria, and taking aim at multiple targets in the country, a US official has told Reuters. This would tally with CNN reports that ships and aircraft form part of the attack. Syrian state TV says anti-aircraft weapons are being used against jets conducting air strikes. A district in Damascus, Barzeh, which houses a scientific laboratory, has been hit, according to one Reuters witness. May echoes Trump\u2019s sentiments in saying that the strike is targeted and is not intended as heralding an open-ended military presence. She continues the pressure on Russia, whom the UK separately accuses of poisoning former Russian spy Sergei Skripal, saying: \u201cWhile this action is specifically about deterring the Syrian regime, it will also send a clear signal to anyone else who believes they can use chemical weapons with impunity.\u201d She criticises Russia for playing a role in closing off alternatives to military action, referring to a veto by Moscow of a UN security council resolution on investigating the attack in Douma. She says \u201cThere is no practicable alternative to the use of force to degrade and deter the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime.\u201d May says the fact that the chemical attack happened \u201cshould surprise no one\u201d given the regime\u2019s history. She adds: This persistent pattern of behaviour must be stopped \u2013 not just to protect innocent people in Syria from the horrific deaths and casualties caused by chemical weapons but also because we cannot allow the erosion of the international norm that prevents the use of these weapons. We have sought to use every possible diplomatic channel to achieve this. The British prime minister, moments after Trump finished speaking. This evening I have authorised British armed forces to conduct co-ordinated and targeted strikes to degrade the Syrian regime\u2019s chemical weapons capability and deter their use. We are acting together with our American and French allies. In Douma, last Saturday a chemical weapons attack killed up to 75 people, including young children, in circumstances of pure horror. Reuters says witnesses in Damascus have heard several large explosions and seen smoke on the east side of the city. Douma lies to the north-east. It is unclear if these are related to the US president\u2019s announcement. Donald Trump has finished speaking now. A Pentagon briefing, presumably shedding light on the targets, will follow in 50 minutes. Stay with us as we make sense of what has happened and will happen. A little flair is entering his statement now: Trump refers to the \u201crighteous power\u201d of the US, UK and France in acting in the region. He urges Americans to say a prayer. He finishes with: \u201cWe pray that god will bring comfort to the suffering and guide the whole region.\u201d \u201cThe US will be a partner and a friend but the fate of the region lies in the hands of its own people.\u201d \u201cAmerica does not seek an indefinite presence in Syria. We look forward to the day when we can bring our warriors home.\u201d Trump delivers a message to those associated with the Assad regime in Syria. \u201cWhat kind of nation wants to be associated with mass murder of innocent men women and children?\u201d he asks. The US president says \u201cthe evil and despicable attack left mothers and fathers, women and children thrashing in pain\u201d. He says \u201cthey are crimes of a monster\u201d. A combined US, British and French military response is under way.

          "bodyText": "England wadded three more gold medals to their haul at the close of the latest day of action on the Gold Coast. Tom Daley and Dan Goodfellow won the men\u2019s synchronised 10m platform in the diving pool, before Jack Laugher and Chris Mears followed up in the men\u2019s synchronised 3m springboard. On the track, Kat Johnson-Thompson won the women\u2019s heptathlon, while her young pretender Niamh Emerson, 18 and from Derby, won bronze in her first Games as a senior athlete. Scotland\u2019s Gracie Reid won gold for her country in the women\u2019s 1m springboard, while her compatriot Alex Marshall became his country\u2019s most successful Commonwealth Games athlete, winning gold as part of the lawn bowls men\u2019s fours. Wales enjoyed success too, with rhythmic gymnast Laura Halford taking silver in the hoop, while the slightly less elegant Kane Charig came second in the men\u2019s -65kg wrestling. Northern Ireland markswoman Kirsty Barr took silver in the women\u2019s trap shooting, while Wales\u2019s Sarah Wixy got the bronze. And so ends another day and night of Commonwealth Games action on the Gold Coast, where Katarina Johnson-Thompson\u2019s gold in the heptathlon seems to be the big story of the day from an English point of view. Tom Daley\u2019s army of admirers might beg to differ - along with his sidekick Daniel Goodfellow, he was victorious in the men\u2019s synchronised 10m platform final. English duo Jack Laugher and Chris Mears have won gold quite comfortably from Canada\u2019s Philippe Gagne and Francois Imbeau-Dulac. Australia\u2019s Domonic Bedggood and Matthew Carter were third. Australia have hammered New Zealand 109-50 in the second semi-final and will play surprise finalists England in the final. Nigeria\u2019s Oluwatobiloba Amusan wins Nigeria\u2019s first ever sprint gold in a time of 12.68sec (WR: 12.20sec), beating Jamaica\u2019s Danielle Williams (12.78) and Yanique Thompson (12.97) into the minor places. It\u2019s good news for Nigeria, but bad news for those of us who have to type words like \u201cOluwatobiloba\u201d for a living. A tense, absorbing competition finishes with Canada\u2019s Alysha Newman taking gold with a height of 4.75m. New Zealand\u2019s Eliza McCartney was second and her compatriot Nina Kennedy was third. England\u2019s Holly Bradshaw and Molly Caudery finished just outside the medals. Jamaica\u2019s Danniel Thomas-Dodd has won gold for Jamaica with a distance of 19.36m. New Zealand\u2019s Valerie Adams was second and Canada\u2019s Brittany Crew was third. Uganda\u2019s Joshua Cheptegei makes it double-gold after his earlier success in the 5,000m, beating Canada\u2019s Mohammad Ahmed into second place once again. He smashes the Games record with a time of 27min 19.62sec, winning by just over a second after proving to strong for his rival in the home straight. Kenya\u2019s Rodgers Kwemoi was third. \u201c\u201cI\u2019m so happy. It\u2019s been a long emotional two days but i\u2019m glad it\u2019s finally over,\u201d she told the BBC in the wake of her gold medal win in the heptathlon. \u201cI was nursing an injury going into day two. I\u2019m just happy I made it over the line, there was no way I was stopping. Considering it\u2019s only April, I\u2019m really happy to get season best performances this early and come away for the gold. I feel like this Championships was mine, I was devastated to pull out four years ago in Glasgow but I\u2019ve got two gold medals now and it\u2019s more than I could ask for this early in the season.\u201d They\u2019re plodding along gracefully in the men\u2019s 10,000m, where Uganda\u2019s Joshua Cheptegei is leading a group of eight runners containing two more of his compatriots and A couple of Kenyans. Canada\u2019s Mohammad Ahmed is also near the front. The women\u2019s pole vault has been going on all morning and England\u2019s Holly Bradshaw is among the leaders who have cleared 4.50m so far. Caster Semenya wins gold for South Africa with a totally dominant performance (and all the usual caveats), setting a Commonwealth Games record with her winning time of 1min 56.68sec. Kenya\u2019s Margaret Wambui finished second andJamaica\u2019s Natoya Goule came third. Gold: Grace Reid (Scotland) Silver: Georgia Sheehan (Australia) Bronze Esther Qin (Australia) Hats off to Grace Reid, who wins the Women\u2019s 1m Springboard Final and takes Scotland\u2019s first ever Commonwealth Games diving medal. England\u2019s Katherine Torrance is distraught after dropping out of the bronze medal position after a sloppy final dive in which she lost points for bending her legs. There\u2019s been an upset on court at the Gold Coast Convention &amp; Exhibition Centre, where England\u2019s women have qualified for the final with a surprise 65-53 win over Canada. They\u2019ll play Australia or New Zealand in the final. The 18-year-old from Derby showed great guts to win bronze at her first appearance at the senior Commonwealth Games. It\u2019s a real turning point for the young athlete as she makes the transition from the junior ranks. Emerson is in her first year of a psychology degree at Loughborough University. Having crossed the line to take gold, Kat Johnson-Thomson has broken down in tears. She looks very upset and I suspect they aren\u2019t tears of joy. She\u2019s got strapping on her right calf and she\u2019s clutching it as if she\u2019s done herself a mischief. She gets to her feet and limps around the track as the results are confirmed. Gold: Katarina Johnson-Thompson (England) Silver: Nina Schulz (Canada) Bronze: Niamh Emerson (England) Update: KJT has now stopped crying and looks well enough to hobble her way around a lap of honour. It\u2019s unconfirmed, but English teenager Niamh Emerson does brilliantly to put in the eight or nine seconds she needs to rob Australia\u2019s Celeste Mucci of the bronze medal with an emphatic win in the 800m. Katarina Johnson-Thompson does enough to take gold, while Canada\u2019s Nina Schulz takes the silver. The two heats of the women\u2019s heptathlon 800m are coming up, the final discipline of an event led by England\u2019s Katerina Johnson-Thompson. She doesn\u2019t need to exert herself too much in this race - a 2min 10sec or possibly even slower will probably do her. KJT goes in the second heat, as does England\u2019s Niamh Emerson, who will need to run a very, very fast time if she\u2019s to nick bronze. They\u2019ll soon be under starters orders. Nigeria\u2019s Suwaibidu Galadima has beaten England\u2019s KJames Arnott into second place, with Jamaica\u2019s Tevaughn Thomas taking the bronze in this sprint primarily for athletes with a below elbow or wrist amputation. England\u2019s 14-point dominance over Canada in the second quarter continues to make up most of the difference between the sides. It\u2019s England 54-38 Canada going into the final quarter. There\u2019s an upset on the cards here, with Canada ranked fifth in the world, more than 20 places higher than the UK, for whom England\u2019s players usually represent. Gold: Conselsus Kipruto (Kenya) 8min 10.07sec Silver: Abraham Kibiwott (Kenya) Bronze: Amos Kirui (Kenya) Conseslus Kipruto wins the gold from his compatriot Abraham Kibiwott. Their fellow Kenyan Amos Kirui was third in a splendid race for bronze. It looked as if Matthew Hughes was going to come third and prevent a Kenyan one-two-three, but despite throwing himself at the line and coming within a half-second of his personal best time, he was just collared by Kirui. That\u2019s Kenya\u2019s sixth consecutive clean sweep in this event at the Commonwealth Games. You could tell it meant a lot to them, as Kipruto sacrificed his own time to turn and urge his fellow countrymen along in the home straight. Amos Kirui leads the field followed by his fellow Kenyans Abraham Kibiwott and Conselsus Kipruto. They\u2019re not having it all their own way at the bell, mind, as Canada\u2019s Matthew Hughes is upsides them and the Kenyans don\u2019t like it one bit. The field are being introduced in the men\u2019s 3,000m steeplechase, where Kenya\u2019s Conseslus Kipruto is hoping to add to his World and Olympic titles. His personal best of 8min 00.12sec was set at the Birmingham Diamond League event in 2016. From the gun, Kipruto and his compatriots Abraham Kibiwott and Amos Kirui take up position at the head of the field. After something of a lull with not much of interest going on (nine days of it, some would argue), the evening\u2019s track and field entertainment is ready to begin at the Carrara Stadium. Here\u2019s what we can look forward to ... Women\u2019s Pole Vault final Men\u2019s 3,000m Steeplechase final Men\u2019s Discus Throw final Men\u2019s T47 100m final Women\u2019s Heptathlon 800m (heats one and two) Women\u2019s Shot Put final Women\u2019s 800m final Men\u2019s 10,000m final Women\u2019s 100m Hurdles final Bouncing and leaping headfirst into water is under way at the Aquatics Centre and England\u2019s Alicia Blagg is the early leader, but there\u2019s a long, long way to go. Alex Marshall became the most successful athlete in Scotland\u2019s Commonwealth Games history after leading his men\u2019s fours team to a dramatic lawn bowls victory over hosts Australia on the Gold Coast. Marshall and his team-mates Ronald Duncan, Derek Oliver and Paul Foster drew four shots on the final end to reverse a two-shot deficit and triumph 15-13, sealing his fifth career gold medal. The 51-year-old Marshall, who also won a silver medal in the men\u2019s pairs earlier in the Games, moves ahead of Allan Wells, who won four golds in a total of six Commonwealth Games medals between 1978 and 1982. Earlier, there was more success for Scotland as Claire Johnston and Lesley Doig won bronze in the women\u2019s pairs with an 18-10 win over Canada. England are currently taking on Canada in the Gold Coast Convention &amp; Exhibition Centre with a place in the final up for grabs. England are bossing things on the court, leading 28-16 after two quarters. Hosts Australia will play New Zealand in the second semi-final later today. Defending champions England failed to qualify from their heat from the first heat of the men\u2019s 4x400m relay after Wolverhampton born athlete Matt Hudson-Smith pulled up with a hamstring injury just 20 metres into the first leg and had to be helped from the track by his team-mates. On the BBC\u2019s coverage, Michael Johnson is wondering whether or not Hudson-Smith, whose attitude and application have been questioned in the past, took his warm-up seriously. Anyway, he\u2019ll be out for eight to 10 weeks now, which doesn\u2019t bode well for his preparations ahead of August\u2019s European Championships. The rest of today\u2019s track and field action begins in about an hour and here\u2019s what\u2019s on the menu ... Women\u2019s Pole Vault final Men\u2019s 3,000m Steeplechase final Men\u2019s Discus Throw final Men\u2019s T47 100m final Women\u2019s Heptathlon 800m (heats one and two) Women\u2019s Shot Put final Women\u2019s 800m final Men\u2019s 10,000m final Women\u2019s 100m Hurdles final Gold Coast and Birmingham could hardly be more different as cities go but Commonwealth Games organisers on both sides believe there are plenty of lessons that will translate ahead of the 2022 Games in Britain\u2019s second city. As the 2018 Games go into their final weekend in the surfers paradise which is Australia\u2019s Gold Coast, attention is beginning to turn to the next edition in the industrial and commercial surrounds of Birmingham, which saw off competition from Liverpool to host the 2022 edition after Durban, South Africa, was stripped of the Games. Gold Coast mayor Tom Tate has told his Birmingham counterparts the Games present an opportunity to change perceptions - whether that be Gold Coast\u2019s transition from holiday destination to business centre or updating people\u2019s ideas about Birmingham. \u201cIt was an opportunity that knocked on the door and we absolutely utilised the spirit of the Commonwealth brand to enhance our city\u2019s reputation,\u201d Tate told PA Sport. \u201cWe have now stepped up from being a regional city to a world city. Trades and businesses can see we\u2019ve hosted the Commonwealth Games and we\u2019re well equipped with infrastructure, you can come here and do business. We\u2019ve hosted the third biggest mutli-sport event in the world so you don\u2019t need to ask our credentials.\u201d It is a model Birmingham can follow, according to Steve Hollingworth, head of sport and events for Birmingham City Council. \u201cThe perception of Birmingham is a very industrial area, a grey miserable city, but that\u2019s not the case,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very modern dynamic city of the world. But people need to see that so we need to get the city on the global stage. A 1.5billion television audience is really important.\u201d Birmingham landed the Games after Durban was stripped of hosting rights due to financial constraints. It\u2019s after 6pm on the Gold Coast, but if you\u2019re just joining us for the first time in the UK this morning, here\u2019s a summary of what happened overnight. Tom Daley and the other bloke led an England one-two in the 10m synchro diving. Matthew Dixon and Noah Williams took silver. Alex Marshall overtook Alan Wells to became the greatest athlete in Scotland\u2019s Commonwealth Games history by takingMen\u2019s Fours Gold Medal Matchthe bowls fours. Scotland\u2019s women won bronze in the Women\u2019s Pairs England beat Wales in the Men\u2019s Fours bronze medal match England\u2019s Robert Paxton won the Mens\u2019 Singles bronze Wales\u2019 Laura Halford wins hoop silver in the rhythmic gymnastics In shooting, Northern Ireland\u2019s Kirsty Barr took silver in the women\u2019s trap Welsh wrestler Kane Kharig won silver in the men\u2019s 65kg England\u2019s Charlie bowling took bronze in the men\u2019s 65kg Katarina Johnson-Thomson leads the heptathlon with the 800m to come later this morning. Those rugby sevens results are coming in thick and fast. Australia have seen off Wales with a minimum of fuss in their Pool B match at the Robinha Stadium, scoring six tries in the process. England have got off to a winning start in the women\u2019s rgby sevens, seeing off Fiji in a reasonably tight affair. Emily Scarratt, Deborah Fleming and Lydia Thompson got the tries for England, with Timaima Ravisa getting a consolation for Fiji. Anyone like me who\u2019s ever played on a team that\u2019s taken a pasting in a game of rugby sevens will know just how big that pitch can be when you\u2019re chasing shadows and sympathise with the women of Kenya who\u2019ve had to try to go toe to toe with their New Zealand counterparts. They\u2019ve been absolutely battered in their Pool A match by a team that was far too good for them. Portia Woodman was the standout player for New Zealand, while Niall Williams grabbed herself a splendidly opportunistic try, chasing up to pounce as one of the Kenyans tried to shepherd the ball out over the dead-ball line. As the sister of All Black Sonny Bill Williams, Niall comes from a family with a fair amount of rugby pedigree. I wonder if she\u2019s as handy as her brother in the boxing ring too? Canada are pulling off quite the demolition job on South Africa in the women\u2019s rugby sevens as I strap myself into the hot-seat. WIth just seconds left in the second half of their Pool A match at the Robina Stadium, the Canadians lead 29-0. Indeed, that\u2019s a result: Canada 29-0 South Africa, with 24 of the winning points coming in the first half. The Canadians scored five tries, with Charity Williams, Sara Kaljuvee, Hannah Darling, Caroline Crossley and Brittany Benn all crossing the line. Ghislaine Landry scored two conversions. And as New Zealand take to the field against Kenya, I shall take my own humble bows. The one, the only, Barry Glendenning, stands poised and ready to shoulder arms here on the liveblog for Team Guardian. Thanks for your company and don\u2019t look away, as the day\u2019s action is only just beginning on the Gold Coast! Rugby sevens \u2013 Canada draw first blood And Canada have really thrown down the gauntlet to the rest of the women\u2019s field here \u2013 as they\u2019ve raced to a 24-0 first half lead against South Africa. Facing one of the favourites, Renfred Dazel\u2019s side could ill-afford charity, Charity Williams that is, who was one of four try scorers in the opening stanza. And Canada have opened how they started in the second half with some fine running rugby to land a fifth. They\u2019ve been so consistent on the women\u2019s sevens series where they\u2019ve been reliably the third best team in the world behind Australia and New Zealand. Can they go one better here at Robina Stadium? South Africa with a rare foray forward but they can\u2019t make the passes stick out wide and Canada keep their line intact. 3 minutes to play here, with Sara Kaluvee getting through a power of work. Canada grab a scrum against the feed \u2013 they\u2019re really dominating at all aspects of the game. Megan Lukan busts through the guts, but is hauled down by some desperate South African defence. But it\u2019s full-time: 29-0 as Canada win the inaugural match of rugby sevens at the Commonwealth Games! Diver Tom Daley speaks out It\u2019s been one of many laudable aspects to these Games with Gold Coast organisers working very hard to create an inclusive space inside the Athlete\u2019s village and around the venues for LGBTI competitors. Guardian\u2019s own Martha Kelner caught up with England\u2019s recent gold medallist, Tom Daley, speaking as an openly gay man in a context where participants from 37 competing nations still face anti-homosexual legislation. More, here: Rugby sevens \u2013 women\u2019s preliminaries underway It feels like one of the more anticipated events of these Games and we\u2019re not too far away from a first kick in anger at the women\u2019s rugby sevens, which makes its Commonwealth Games debut in around.. two minutes time! First up is Canada v South Africa \u2013 no slouches here the North Americans, they did, as you\u2019ll recall finish with the bronze at Rio 2016. And 47 seconds in, we have our first points of the Game \u2013 an error by the South Africans enables Canada to overload their right flank, and they send their winger, Caroline Crossley over. No conversion, 5-0 the score. Boxing semifinals A wrap of the day\u2019s boxing bouts, where there have been plenty of bronze medals awarded, with our gold medal stoushes still to come. England\u2019s Lisa Whiteside and Northern Ireland\u2019s Carly McNaul have advanced in the women\u2019s 51kg division, with England\u2019s Paige Murney and Australia\u2019s Anja Stridsman set to square off in the 60kg final. Good news also for England\u2019s Galal Yafai and India\u2019s Amit (so good they named him once) in the &lt;50kg division, with compatriot Gaurav Solanki and Northern Ireland\u2019s Brendan Irvine set to face in the 52kg final. It\u2019s India again advancing in the 60kg class, where Manish Kausik will face Australia\u2019s Harry Garside, while Jonas Jonas (so good they named him twice) of Namibia has advanced to face Canada\u2019s Thomas Blumenfeld in the 64kg final. Finally, it\u2019s an all-antipodean slugfest in the 91kg bout as New Zealand\u2019s David Nyika is set to face Australia\u2019s Jason Whateley. So a fair mix of nations in the hunt for boxing gold, with the weight of a nation on the shoulders of Jonas Jonas as he chases just Namibia\u2019s fourth ever Games gold. A recap on where we\u2019re at in the women\u2019s heptathlon, where there\u2019s been a lot of interest not just in the form of favourite Katarina Johnson-Thompson, but also the two local hopes Alysha Burnett who has been battling a hamstring injury picked up in the 200m, and youngster Celeste Mucci. Don\u2019t forget England lost Katie Stainton in disastrous circumstances less than five seconds into the entire event as she fell heavily in the 110m hurdles, but with two events conducted today KJT appears to have all but secured the gold. She blew away her competitors with a 6.50m mark in the long jump, an effort that wouldn\u2019t have looked out of place in the stand-alone women\u2019s final, before only conceding 130 points in her less fancied event of javelin. Nina Schultz of Canada finished second in the long jump and fifth in the javelin, with Mucci third and sixth to maintain their positions of second and third on the provisional podium. Burnett with the longest throw in the javelin to keep pace at fifth overall, but she may face difficulty with her hamstring once more in the 800m. If successful in tonight\u2019s last event it will be some statement of intent from KJT who revealed she was emotionally \u2018burnt out\u2019 after winning gold at the world indoor games last month. In their own words Cyprus gymnast Diamanto Evripidou says she arrived at the Gold Coast hoping to win a medal. Job done, eh? \u201cI came here to win one medal only, and I have six,\u201d the 18-year-old said. \u201cI will work a lot to reach my goals, and the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games is one of them.\u201d And also this, from England\u2019s Tom Daley after his win alongside Daniel Goodfellow in the men\u2019s 10m synchronised diving, after overcoming a hip injury that forced him to withdraw from the individual event. \u201cI know I\u2019ve won medals in the past but it\u2019s been a smoother journey to get to those competitions whereas this has been a really rough and rocky ride,\u201d he told the BBC. And while we catch our collective breath from that high drama (TM), let\u2019s sneak around the grounds: It\u2019s been a display of shuttlecock by the Adcock\u2019s as England\u2019s duo Chris and Gabrielle have beaten the Australian pair in the badminton mixed doubles quarterfinals. We\u2019ve got semifinals underway in the men\u2019s 64kg boxing where Canada\u2019s Thomas Blumenfeld appears to be shading Ghana\u2019s Jessie Lartey. In the women\u2019s hockey 5th place match it\u2019s Canada also enjoying a lead over African opposition in the form of South Africa \u2013 they lead 2-0 with a quarter to play, thanks to Shanlee Johnson and Madeleine Secco\u2019s first stanza goals. A reminder the men\u2019s semifinals will take place later tonight (local) with Australia facing England, and India locking horns with New Zealand. On the greens of Broadbeach, England have beaten Wales for the bronze medal in the men\u2019s lawn bowl fours, while there\u2019s another antipodean battle going down in the men\u2019s squash doubles quarterfinals with Australia and New Zealand deep in the third set. And for seemingly the first time I\u2019ve been in this chair, I can happily report, that is actually everything that\u2019s happening right now! So much so that local broadcaster Channel 7 has taken us to an extended press conference announcing their network\u2019s coup in pinching free-to-air cricket from rivals Channel 9. Saucer of milk, anyone? Wowee. We\u2019ve had a very tight measure from the umpire, with both teams appearing confident of a one-ball lead. From my uninformed eye I thought that was the Scots\u2019 point, but a roar goes up, it\u2019s awarded to the host nation and they take a 13-11 lead into the last end. As they say, it\u2019s a game of millimetres! Great battles within battles here, don\u2019t forget it was two of the Scottish four here, Ronald Duncan and Derek Oliver, who beat three of the Australians here for gold in the men\u2019s triples. The other two Scots picked up silver in the men\u2019s pairs so some real bowls pedigree here. Huge roar from the engrossed home crowd here as Australia\u2019s lead Barrie Lester drops his first ball right on the jack. But with the stakes incredibly high Scotland\u2019s Oliver, bowling second, has fired a two-point turnaround; can they lock it up?! There are five balls left to fire, with Scotland three to throw. Can they add a third and pull of a remarkable turnaround to snatch gold?! Marshall drops one more in; it\u2019s a potential three-pointer \u2013 but have they left themselves open to a drive? Sherriff fires, but he\u2019s only cleaned out a screening Australian bowl! Marshall drops another in \u2013 learned bowls experts would rightly point out that he\u2019s only doubled the potential target for a cleanout; has he thrown it away? But would you believe it \u2013 Sherriff\u2019s missed with a second drive, and Scotland land a four pointer! With the final end, they\u2019ve turned this all around to win 15-13! Remarkable action. And what a Games this is turning into for the Scottish bowls team! Meanwhile, we\u2019ve got a sneaky little ding-dong battle brewing over at Broadbeach Bowls Club where it\u2019s Australia and Scotland trading blows in the men\u2019s fours gold medal match. We join the coverage 12 ends in where it\u2019s the host nation leading 12-10, with four balls (two each) to come. Having jumped to a 8-2 lead after four ends the Australian team of Barrie Lester, Brett Wilkie, Nathan Rice and Aron Sherriff have seen some tenacious bowling from the Scots; and as we speak, they\u2019ve reversed a potential two-pointer here for Australia into one of their own. That\u2019s four of the last five ends to Scotland; what a finish we have in store here! In addition to the one-woman nation Diamanto Evripidou here\u2019s a rundown of what other medals have already been claimed this morning: It\u2019s an Indian one-two in the women\u2019s 50m rifle 3 positions, as Tejaswini Sawant continues her fine form, with compatriot Anjum Moudgil grabbing the silver ahead of Scotland\u2019s Seonaid McIntosh. Gold for India also in the men\u2019s 25m rapid fire pistol where the remarkable fifteen-year-old Anish (so good they named him once) has held off local favourite Sergei Evglevski with a games record performance. He was flawless after two attempts, instantly doubling the scores of four of his five rivals. What a future lies ahead, at such a tender age! It\u2019s been a terrific day for Malaysia as well, with Evripidou unable to take ALL the medals in the rhythmic gymnastics, the Malay duo of Sie Yan Koi and Kwan Dict Weng have helped themselves to gold, two silvers and two bronzes. Their women\u2019s pair lawn bowls team have also grabbed gold over at Broadbeach, relegating South Africa and Scotland to the minors. Finally, it\u2019s been a powerful display from England in the men\u2019s synchronised 10m platform diving with Thomas Daley and Daniel Goodfellow just shading compatriots Matthew Dixon and Noah Williams in a synchro one-two. Australia with the bronze but they really have dominated the diving boards have England. Chapeau! And let\u2019s take a look at the latest medal tally where the big movers appear to be Cyprus, off the back of a phenomenal day\u2019s work from their unbelievable rhythmic gymnast Diamanto Evripidou. With four gold, one silver and a bronze \u2013 claiming a medal in every event she entered \u2013 the pocket rocket would be sitting 13th in the Commonwealth if she had entered as an stand-alone nation. She joins England\u2019s gymnast Nile Wilson (four gold and two silver) and Australian swimmer Mitch Larkin (five gold) in rarified company, with four of those medals coming in the last 24 hours. As an aside \u2013 when you split the medals of the leading nations by gender some very curious things leap out. Australia\u2019s men and women have thirty each (with three coming from mixed-gender teams), England fifteen and thirteen respectively, and India\u2019s sexes both pulling their weight with six and eight gold each. But Canada, you ask? 92% of their gold have come from female athletes, prompting the very real question: what has happened to Canadian men? Send your entries to \u201cWhat has happened to Canadian men\u201d care of the nearest local post office etc etc. Until I hear otherwise I will hold full-time heartthrob and part-time politician Justin Trudeau personally responsible; he\u2019s apparently emasculated an entire nation. Kia ora koutou \u2013 welcome to day nine of the Commonwealth Games! If you missed yesterday\u2019s action there was another strong showing for the host nation, spearheaded by the amazing Ken Hanson, a first-time medallist at the age of 68. There was the highest of high drama in the men\u2019s 200m final, and a heart-warming/breaking tale as British Virgin Islands claimed it\u2019s first ever gold. There\u2019s a nice sneak peak at Australia\u2019s women\u2019s rugby sevens team, eager to defend their Rio gold and a fine write-up of the irrepressible Jack Laugher in the diving. As always, feel free to shoot any quips, tangential stories or corrections to join the coverage \u2013 via the email or twitter account outlined above. But first, a look at what\u2019s in store today. Coming up Here\u2019s what\u2019s still to come on day nine. Remember, all times are local \u2013 the Gold Coast is GMT +10:00 and EST +14:00. It\u2019s hotting up in many of the team events, and we start with Canada and South Africa battling for fifth in the women\u2019s hockey. At 3pm local there are medals on offer in the women\u2019s shooting trap final, before men\u2019s hockey takes centre stage as Scotland and Malaysia lock horns, also for fifth. Rugby sevens makes its long-awaited start from 4.30pm with eight matches in the women\u2019s preliminaries, before the medals continue in table tennis and wrestling, as well as lawn bowls where the men\u2019s singles bronze and gold medal matches take centre lawn from 5.30pm. All of that in the \u2018lull\u2019 part of the day before athletics, diving, hockey and basketball renew again in anger. It\u2019s Commonwealth Games, it\u2019s happening live, and it\u2019s coming at you like two South African sprinters when everyone told you Yohan Blake would win.",

          "bodyText": "When Myles Shumlanski picked up his phone late on Friday afternoon, his son\u2019s voice \u2013 frantic and hysterical \u2013 rang through the line. \u201cThe bus was in an accident,\u201d Nick Shumlanski screamed. The younger Shumlanski, who is 20, had been on the Humboldt Broncos team bus as the junior hockey team headed to a high-stakes playoff game against the Nipawin Hawks in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. Myles Shumlanski rushed to the scene of the crash, where one of the worst disasters ever to strike Canada\u2019s sporting community was unfolding. He found his son standing, miraculously. Nearby lay the bus, unrecognisable after much of its roof was torn off. A semi-trailer lay overturned in the snow-covered fields that lined the highway. \u201cAs soon as I came I knew that it was a disaster,\u201d Shumlanski told the Regina Leader-Post. \u201cIt was a pretty devastating sight.\u201d The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said 29 people were on the bus when it collided with a semi-trailer on a rural highway 200km (124 miles) north-east of Saskatoon. The crash left 15 people dead and more than a dozen injured, plunging hockey-loving Canada into shock and mourning. Nick Shumlanski appeared to be one of the few kids who was able to walk. \u201cIt was chaos,\u201d his father said. Some people were trapped under debris, unable to move, and Shumlanski worried that others were stuck in the wreckage. Everyone seemed to be reeling from shock, he said. After putting his son in his car he returned to the scene, joining passing motorists who had stopped to help in the long minutes before emergency responders arrived. \u201cPeople were getting blankets,\u201d he said. \u201cYou were taking your jackets. You were doing anything to cover these boys. They were in snow and ice and it was very cold \u2026 they were in very bad shape.\u201d News of the crash shook Canada. \u201cAn entire country is in shock and mourning,\u201d the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said in a statement. \u201cWe are heartbroken knowing many of those we lost had their entire lives in front of them. We grieve with those facing news no parent or family should ever have to face.\u201d As the team\u2019s players hail from across western Canada, ranging in age from 16 to 21, reports of the crash sent parents from nearby provinces rushing to the scene, fearing the worst. Condolences poured in from across the country and around the world, including the hockey world in which long bus journeys in brutal winter conditions are a mainstay. Saskatchewan native Mike Babcock, now coach of the Toronto Maple Leafs NHL team, fought back tears as he described a horrific accident. \u201cIt\u2019s got to rip the heart out of your chest,\u201d he said. Police said it was too early to determine the cause of the collision. After detaining the truck driver, police released him and provided psychological support. In Humboldt, the close-knit farming community of 6,000 where the team played, the Broncos\u2019 home arena was turned into an impromptu crisis centre, bringing together mourners, fans and locals. The stairs of the arena became a makeshift memorial, with flowers placed between railings wrapped in the team\u2019s colours, yellow and green. People grieved at the arena on Sunday, laying flowers and jerseys in a makeshift memorial at the entrance and later gathering inside to mourn the deaths. Trudeau visited the injured in hospital and then attended the vigil. Trudeau sat among the crowd with his 11-year-old son, Xavier, a hockey player. Among more than a dozen injured in the crash, some started to report progress on Sunday. One father said he had been sent out by his son on a midnight run for McDonald\u2019s chicken nuggets. Team officials said one player had been released from hospital. While police had yet to release the names of those killed in the crash, social media lit up with tributes to those reportedly killed: 10 players, the driver of the bus, two coaches, a volunteer statistician and a play-by-play announcer.

          "bodyText": "Canada has been plunged into \u201cshock and mourning\u201d after 15 people died and more than a dozen were injured in a \u201cnightmare\u201d collision between a bus carrying a junior hockey team and a semi-trailer. The royal Canadian mounted police said 29 people, including the driver, were on the Humboldt Broncos team bus when the crash occurred late on Friday afternoon on a rural highway some 200km (124 miles) north-east of Saskatoon in the province of Saskatchewan. The team had been heading to a Saskatchewan junior hockey league playoff game against the Nipawin Hawks, officials said. The crash has shocked hockey-loving Canada, where sports teams often travel hours in gruelling winter conditions. Within hours of the launch of a fundraising campaign to help those affected by the crash, it had raised more than C$2.4m ($1.8m), far exceeding its initial target of C$100,000. \u201cAn entire country is in shock and mourning,\u201d the country\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said. \u201cThis is every parent\u2019s worst nightmare. No one should ever have to see their child leave to play the sport they love and never come back.\u201d The International Ice Hockey Federation said a moment of silence would be observed during upcoming games between Poland and Estonia, and Latvia and Kazakhstan. In the National Hockey League, the Calgary Flames put up a Broncos team photo in their locker room while the the Philadelphia Flyers held a moment of silence before their game against the New York Rangers. On Saturday the Broncos\u2019 home arena in Humboldt became an impromptu crisis centre, bringing together mourners, fans and locals who knew the team\u2019s coaches and players, who hail from across western Canada and range in age from 16 to 21 years. The stairs of the rink were turned into a makeshift memorial. Flowers were placed alongside railings wrapped in the team\u2019s colours of yellow and green. The Broncos president, Kevin Garinger, described the deep shock in the community. The Broncos were a close-knit team who were well-known in the small farming community of 6,000 where they played, he said. \u201cWe are stunned and grieving,\u201d he told a news conference on Saturday. \u201cEverything about this tragedy is unprecedented.\u201d While police are yet to release the names of those killed in the crash, social media lit up with tributes to those reportedly killed. Darcy Haugan, the head coach described as an incredible mentor to the team\u2019s young players, Logan Schatz, the captain who had led the team for more than two of his four years on the team, and Jaxon Joseph, one of the team\u2019s leading scorers, were among those named. An announcer and reporter with a local radio station, Tyler Bieber, was also reportedly among the killed. Those injured in the crash were transported to hospitals in Saskatoon, some with critical injuries, police said. The truck driver was not injured in the crash. A photo tweeted early on Saturday showed three of the team\u2019s players lying side-by-side in hospital beds, hands clasped together. The caption said the three were \u201cbonding and healing\u201d.

The community was angered further when Saunders told the Globe and Mail\u2019s editorial board that the killer might have been caught sooner had more community members come forward with tips. Before charges were announced against McArthur in January, it appeared Toronto police and Pride organisers were close to reaching an agreement for the force to attend the 2018 parade. The office of John Tory, the mayor of Toronto, did not respond to a request for comment on the most recent developments. The LGBT community is also grappling with the recent deaths of Alloura Wells, a trans woman whose death remains unsolved, and Tess Richey, who was killed in the Gay Village in November. \u201cWe will come together, as we have for decades, and we will be seen. We will rally and rise but it will be with heavy hearts as we have not yet begun to grapple with our anger, shock and grief,\u201d said the Pride Toronto statement. The organisers called for \u201cfocus on deeper dialogue, collaborative action and sustained institutional change. Only a significant commitment and meaningful action can start the critical work of making our communities safer.\u201d \u2022This article was amended on 17 April 2018 to make clear that Tess Richey died in November.",

Two decades later, Cavanaugh was arrested for blocking the entrance of a facility belonging to her former employer, as part of a wider protest against plans to expand a pipeline snaking from Alberta\u2019s oil sands to the Pacific coast. She was one of more than 115 people detained this week in the Canadian province of British Columbia as an indigenous-led protest against the Trans Mountain Expansion project heated up. On Friday two federal MPs \u2013 Green party leader Elizabeth May and Kennedy Stewart of the New Democratic party \u2013 were arrested after they joined protesters attempting to block construction work related to the expansion. Elsewhere, more than 60 actions unfolded across Canada in a show of solidarity with the protests. Spearheaded by Texas-based Kinder Morgan, the C$7.4bn ($5.7bn) project proposes expanding an existing pipeline to lay nearly 1,000km of new pipeline from Alberta to Vancouver\u2019s coastline. The project, which still needs to obtain numerous local permits and approvals, would nearly triple the flow of Alberta\u2019s landlocked bitumen to the west coast and dramatically increase oil tanker traffic in the Pacific.
