Claiming he was practising \u201cdefensive medicine\u201d, he gave healthy women under 25 smear tests (generally performed by a nurse) and performed unnecessary breast examinations on women under 50. Shah breached NHS guidelines by not offering a chaperone for intimate examinations and didn\u2019t always wear gloves. He left one patient entirely naked on the table. The youngest of his victims was 15, and her experiences left her \u201canxious, fearful and shaking\u201d and afraid of visiting doctors.</p> <p>In some ways, this case serves as a masterclass in determined and manipulative abuse. Shah would frighten patients about their family medical history. At other times, he\u2019d mention celebrities such as Angelina Jolie (who underwent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/24/angelina-jolie-surgery-heralded-ovarian-cancer-doctors\" title=\"\">a preventive double mastectomy</a> after testing positive for the BRCA gene mutation) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/mar/22/jade-goody-obituary\" title=\"\">Jade Goody</a> (who died in 2009 from cervical cancer). There it is \u2013 the contempt. And not just for those patients, for all women \u2013 including Jolie and Goody, whose suffering he so cynically exploited.</p> <p>Here, you could make a guess at Shah\u2019s thought processes \u2013 dazzle patients with celebrity names and they\u2019ll let you do anything you want. What rot. Those patients would have instinctively trusted Shah, not because he bandied around famous names, but because he was a doctor.</p> <p>Who are these people who put themselves in positions of trust but can\u2019t be trusted? Maybe that\u2019s part of the problem \u2013 the automatic deference given to medical professionals leading, in some, to a weaponised sense of entitlement. Characters such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/04/ian-paterson-inquiry-culture-of-denial-allowed-rogue-breast-surgery\" title=\"\">Ian Paterson</a>, the breast surgeon given 20 years in 2017, who subjected more than 1,000 patients to unnecessary and damaging surgery, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/paterson-inquiry-report\" title=\"\">an inquiry</a> last week citing \u201ca culture of avoidance and denial\u201d in a \u201cdysfunctional\u201d healthcare system.</p> <p>Such cases shatter trust in the medical profession, just as trust has been destroyed in myriad other areas, from the clergy to the care system to education. Now, it seems, women aren\u2019t even able to walk into their GP surgery to normally, routinely, discuss their health. They have to be wary and alert and, if they require an intimate examination by a male GP, should seriously consider the option of a chaperone and fight against that all-powerful female urge not to be \u201cdemanding\u201d, not to make a \u201cfuss\u201d.</p> <p>Is this the future \u2013 mandatory chaperoned medicine between the sexes? All that extra expense for the NHS, and pressure on patients, just because some men abuse their power? Well, if that\u2019s what it takes\u2026 People see medics when they\u2019re at their most vulnerable \u2013 they <em>need</em> to feel safe. Now women know that their GP surgery could be just another unsafe space to deal with.</p> <h2>When the going gets tough, the desperate start growing beards</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1913bacda0533b8a8ea9e54a6bfcfa78080375b6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1913bacda0533b8a8ea9e54a6bfcfa78080375b6/0_12_3095_1857/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prince Harry\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prince Harry: taking it on the chin/</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: POOL/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It seems that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/feb/06/stubble-in-mind-what-growing-a-crisis-beard-represents\" title=\"\">men who suddenly sport beards</a> may be trying to tell us something and it\u2019s not just: \u201cI can\u2019t find the razor.\u201d</p> <p>The US website Vox coined the phrase \u201ccrisis beard\u201d for face-fluff that sprouts under extreme pressure. For instance, the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has been getting hairier with each new political crisis.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/aug/14/worlddispatch.julianborger\" title=\"\">Al Gore</a> grew a beard after losing the presidency to George W Bush. David Letterman morphed into Grizzly Adams when he stopped doing his chatshow. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Mh1_jdK-9E\" title=\"\">Prince Harry</a> also has a beard: he had it before he married Meghan Markle, but don\u2019t be alarmed \u2013 this doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t blame her for it.</p> <p>Crisis beards are thought to be about rebellion, individualism and deep, existential despair. Respect to men. Women also express themselves via hair, but only men can cover two-thirds of their faces with anguished cries for help from their very souls.</p> <p>It\u2019s also interesting to see politicos go this route. The crisis beard could be the chic new way to express political anxiety, sorrow and humility.

          "bodyText": "It sounds to me that the London GP Manish Shah not only sexually assaulted female patients, but that he despised them too. Shah has been given three life sentences for committing a total of 90 sexual assaults on 24 female patients at Mawney medical centre in Romford, east London, between 2009 and 2013. Claiming he was practising \u201cdefensive medicine\u201d, he gave healthy women under 25 smear tests (generally performed by a nurse) and performed unnecessary breast examinations on women under 50. Shah breached NHS guidelines by not offering a chaperone for intimate examinations and didn\u2019t always wear gloves. He left one patient entirely naked on the table. The youngest of his victims was 15, and her experiences left her \u201canxious, fearful and shaking\u201d and afraid of visiting doctors. In some ways, this case serves as a masterclass in determined and manipulative abuse. Shah would frighten patients about their family medical history. At other times, he\u2019d mention celebrities such as Angelina Jolie (who underwent a preventive double mastectomy after testing positive for the BRCA gene mutation) and Jade Goody (who died in 2009 from cervical cancer). There it is \u2013 the contempt. And not just for those patients, for all women \u2013 including Jolie and Goody, whose suffering he so cynically exploited. Here, you could make a guess at Shah\u2019s thought processes \u2013 dazzle patients with celebrity names and they\u2019ll let you do anything you want. What rot. Those patients would have instinctively trusted Shah, not because he bandied around famous names, but because he was a doctor. Who are these people who put themselves in positions of trust but can\u2019t be trusted? Maybe that\u2019s part of the problem \u2013 the automatic deference given to medical professionals leading, in some, to a weaponised sense of entitlement. Characters such as Ian Paterson, the breast surgeon given 20 years in 2017, who subjected more than 1,000 patients to unnecessary and damaging surgery, an inquiry last week citing \u201ca culture of avoidance and denial\u201d in a \u201cdysfunctional\u201d healthcare system. Such cases shatter trust in the medical profession, just as trust has been destroyed in myriad other areas, from the clergy to the care system to education. Now, it seems, women aren\u2019t even able to walk into their GP surgery to normally, routinely, discuss their health. They have to be wary and alert and, if they require an intimate examination by a male GP, should seriously consider the option of a chaperone and fight against that all-powerful female urge not to be \u201cdemanding\u201d, not to make a \u201cfuss\u201d. Is this the future \u2013 mandatory chaperoned medicine between the sexes? All that extra expense for the NHS, and pressure on patients, just because some men abuse their power? Well, if that\u2019s what it takes\u2026 People see medics when they\u2019re at their most vulnerable \u2013 they need to feel safe. Now women know that their GP surgery could be just another unsafe space to deal with. When the going gets tough, the desperate start growing beards It seems that men who suddenly sport beards may be trying to tell us something and it\u2019s not just: \u201cI can\u2019t find the razor.\u201d The US website Vox coined the phrase \u201ccrisis beard\u201d for face-fluff that sprouts under extreme pressure. For instance, the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has been getting hairier with each new political crisis. Al Gore grew a beard after losing the presidency to George W Bush. David Letterman morphed into Grizzly Adams when he stopped doing his chatshow. Prince Harry also has a beard: he had it before he married Meghan Markle, but don\u2019t be alarmed \u2013 this doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t blame her for it. Crisis beards are thought to be about rebellion, individualism and deep, existential despair. Respect to men. Women also express themselves via hair, but only men can cover two-thirds of their faces with anguished cries for help from their very souls. It\u2019s also interesting to see politicos go this route. The crisis beard could be the chic new way to express political anxiety, sorrow and humility. Which is all very timely, after just reading that the former prime minister David Cameron has made \u00a31.6m (at least!) since his Brexit resignation. Why is this man still clean shaven? Mr Cameron, you owe the UK a beard. Make it a big one. Computer-generated porn is as degrading as the real thing Are women meant to cheer because the violent porn of the future may be computer-generated? An algorithm has been developed to produce deep-fake images that could replace performers in porn. While deepfakes already exist in porn, often that is to humiliate real people, grafting their heads on to bodies. This would be about replacing humans altogether, stopping the exploitation and degradation of real-life porn workers, the rationale being that, whatever happens during porn wouldn\u2019t matter because the women wouldn\u2019t exist. This is being viewed as a Good Thing, but is it really? Women already don\u2019t exist in any valid way in porn. They may be there bodily; otherwise, they\u2019re mere ciphers for an increasingly normalised hardcore roster of male sexual demands. Female behaviour, language and reactions are performed to order for the exclusive satisfaction of men. Female sexual autonomy is nowhere to be found: desire is faked, or explicitly unwanted, such as in hugely popular rape porn, where female fear and distress are the chief erotic components. Deepfaked visuals wouldn\u2019t render porn ethical, because the mentality would still be there. While you could fake the imagery, it would be impossible to computer-generate away the violent and misogynistic mindset that drives porn. You would not stop porn warping and damaging male minds in the real world, where all the real women live. If realistic deepfake \u201cmen\u201d could be depicted gang-raping a realistic deepfake \u201cwoman\u201d, how does this improve anything for real women? If nothing is real, and anything goes, porn imagery could even become worse, further sexualising and trivialising the rape, battery and murder of women.

Guaid\u00f3, who has spent the last year battling \u2013 so far unsuccessfully \u2013 to topple Maduro, arrived at the White House on Wednesday afternoon and was met by Trump. Earlier, a senior administration official told reporters to expect the moves against Maduro in the next 30 days, without specifying what form they might take. \u201cWe are probably halfway to what maximum pressure [on Maduro] could look like,\u201d they said. \u201cWe are only moving in one direction and that is forwards.\u201d The official said Trump instructed all parts of the US government \u201cto use all of the tools at their disposal to further create stress upon Maduro and his cronies\u201d. But Guaid\u00f3\u2019s t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate with Trump was overshadowed by Mitt Romney\u2019s announcement that he would vote for the US president\u2019s impeachment. As that news broke, journalists were abruptly excluded from a planned Oval Office encounter between Trump and Guaid\u00f3 by the White House press office, without immediate explanation. The previous evening Trump had used his State of the Union address to offer Guaid\u00f3 a high-profile show of support. As Guaid\u00f3 looked on from the gallery, Trump declared him \u201cthe true and legitimate president of Venezuela\u201d leading a \u201crighteous struggle for freedom\u201d. \u201cMaduro is an illegitimate ruler \u2026 but Maduro\u2019s grip on tyranny will be smashed and broken,\u201d Trump vowed to loud applause from both Republican and Democratic lawmakers. In a clear sign of how Trump sees Venezuela as an important element of his 2020 presidential campaign, he added: \u201cSocialism destroys nations. But always remember, freedom unifies the soul.\u201d Observers described Trump\u2019s public blessing as a triumph for Guaid\u00f3, who defied a travel ban to leave Venezuela last month and is concluding a world tour which also included meetings with Boris Johnson, Emmanuel Macron and Justin Trudeau. \u201cI think it\u2019s huge for Guaid\u00f3,\u201d said Guillermo Zubillaga, a Venezuela specialist at the Americas Society/Council of the Americas. \u201cIt erases all the doubts about his leadership \u2026 it unites people around him and it emboldens him. I don\u2019t know how this trip could have been more successful.\u201d Vanessa Neumann, Guaid\u00f3\u2019s envoy to the United Kingdom, said Trump\u2019s statement of \u201cvery solid\u201d support would also shield Guaid\u00f3 from arrest when he tried to return to Venezuela in the coming days. The senior administration official said Maduro would face \u201cvery significant consequences\u201d if Guaid\u00f3 was harmed. But many analysts question what concrete impact Trump\u2019s words will have on Guaid\u00f3\u2019s faltering campaign to force out Maduro. Luis Vicente Le\u00f3n, a top Venezuelan pollster, said Guaid\u00f3 could certainly consider Trump\u2019s backing a victory. But it was now crucial for Guaid\u00f3 \u2013 whose domestic popularity has slumped since he launched his campaign for change in January 2019 \u2013 to return home with concrete results such as increased US pressure on Maduro\u2019s key allies, China and Russia. \u201cIf you return with nothing new, if you cannot convert potential energy into kinetic energy, you fall back into decline.

But during a rally in Miami on Saturday he told supporters \u201call options are on the table \u2013 but also underneath it too\u201d.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What other coronaviruses have there been?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>New and troubling viruses usually originate in animal hosts. Ebola and flu are other examples \u2013 severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) are both caused by coronaviruses that came from animals.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms of the Wuhan coronavirus?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The virus causes&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/23/pneumonia-what-are-the-symptoms-and-who-is-at-risk\">pneumonia</a>. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. If people are admitted to hospital, they may get support for their lungs and other organs as well as fluids. Recovery will depend on the strength of their immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is the virus being transmitted from one person to another?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>China\u2019s national health commission has confirmed human-to-human transmission, and there have been such transmissions elsewhere. As of 12 February there are now 45,182 confirmed cases and 1,115 deaths. There are cases in 28 other countries outside&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/china\">China</a>, with deaths recorded in one case in Hong Kong, and one case in the Philippines. The number of people to have contracted the virus overall could be far higher, as people with mild symptoms may not have been detected.</p>\n    <p>The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK has doubled from four to eight after four more people in Brighton were diagnosed with the infection over the weekend.</p>\n    <p>One of the other four confirmed cases is being treated at the HCID unit at the Royal Free hospital in north London, and the two Chinese nationals who tested positive for Coronavirus in York are being treated at the HCID centre in Newcastle.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Why is this worse than normal influenza, and how worried are the experts?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>We don\u2019t yet know how dangerous the new coronavirus is, and we won\u2019t know until more data comes in. The mortality rate is around 2%. However, this is likely to be an overestimate since many more people are likely to have been infected by the virus but not suffered severe enough symptoms to attend hospital, and so have not been counted. For comparison, seasonal flu typically has a mortality rate below 1% and is thought to cause about&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6815659/\">400,000 deaths</a>&nbsp;each year globally. Sars had a death rate of more than 10%.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Unless you have recently travelled to China or been in contact with someone infected with the virus, then you should treat any cough or cold symptoms as normal. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/cough/\">NHS advises</a>&nbsp;that people should call 111 instead of visiting the GP\u2019s surgery as there is a risk they may infect others.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is this a pandemic and should we panic?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Health experts are starting to say it could become a pandemic, but right now it falls short of what the WHO would consider to be one. A pandemic, in WHO terms, is \u201cthe worldwide spread of a disease\u201d. Coronavirus cases have been confirmed in about 25 countries outside China, but by no means in all 195 on the WHO\u2019s list.</p>\n    <p>There is no need to panic. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. The WHO has declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern, and says there is a \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d to halt the spread of the disease. The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley\">Sarah Boseley</a>&nbsp;</b><i>Health editor </i>and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/hannah-devlin\"><b>Hannah Devlin</b></a>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>There have been 24,363 cases of the new coronavirus confirmed in China and 490 deaths, he said at a briefing in Geneva.

          "bodyText": "Lawyers for a Chinese telecoms executive arrested in Vancouver have argued that her extradition to the US would allow a foreign state to criminalize behavior in Canada. Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Huawei and eldest daughter of its founder, Ren Zhengfei, is wanted by US authorities for alleged fraud related to sanctions against Iran. In the second day of a five-day extradition hearing in Vancouver, lawyers for Meng argued that the US accusations against her would not be considered a crime in Canada, where she was arrested in 2018. \u201cCanada doesn\u2019t enforce foreign criminal law,\u201d said Meng\u2019s lawyer Eric Gottardi. \u201cWe simply cannot import that law and have it operate in Canada domestically. It\u2019s contrary to our values.\u201d The US alleges Meng lied to the bank HSBC about Huawei\u2019s relationship with its Iran-based affiliate Skycom, putting the bank at risk of violating US sanctions against Tehran. On Monday, defense attorneys argued that the US was abusing its treaty with Canada by asking it to detain Meng for prosecution as part of a campaign that Ren, Huawei\u2019s chief executive, surmised aimed to crush China\u2019s largest international company. They argued that Meng\u2019s misrepresentations, if they occurred, did not amount to fraud, and that Canada had repudiated the US sanctions against Iran. \u201cWould we be here in the absence of US sanctions? Our response is no,\u201d Richard Peck, the lead defense lawyer, told a packed courtroom. The hearing is scheduled to last until Friday. Meng\u2019s arrest during a stopover of a Hong Kong-to-Mexico flight in December 2018 placed her at the center of a US-China trade row, with Donald Trump once musing that he would gladly trade her release for Chinese trade concessions. It also put Canada in the middle of the feud between the US and China, with which Justin Trudeau had hoped to nurture closer economic ties. Nine days after Meng was taken into custody at the Vancouver airport, China arrested two Canadians \u2013 the former diplomat Michael Kovrig and the businessman Michael Spavor. Their detentions on espionage suspicions, along with Chinese restrictions on Canadian agricultural imports, have been widely interpreted as retribution by Beijing aimed at pressuring Canada to free Meng. Former Canadian political leaders have urged the prime minister to concede and release Meng in a \u201cprisoner swap\u201d for Kovrig and Spavor. But extradition experts consulted by AFP said that that would encourage \u201chostage diplomacy\u201d. China\u2019s foreign ministry on Monday characterized Meng\u2019s extradition case as a \u201cgrave political incident\u201d, while renewing calls for Ottawa to release her to normalize relations. Canada\u2019s deputy prime minister, Chrystia Freeland, responded that Ottawa \u201chonors its extradition treaty commitments\u201d and would not interfere in the case while it was before the courts. In a statement, Huawei said that it trusted Canada\u2019s judicial system and believed Meng would be found innocent.",

Huawei\u2019s founder was in combative mood today: More than 20 top bosses are dining with Donald Trump tonight, including the bosses of Saudi Aramco, Sony, Softbank, BP and Barclays. Here\u2019s the full list, via the White House pool. Dr. Patrice Motsepe, Founder &amp; Executive Chairman, African Rainbow Minerals, South Africa Hiroshi Mikitani, Chairman &amp; Chief Executive Officer, Rakuten Inc., Japan Dr. Joerg Reinhardt, Chairman of the Board of Directors, Novartis AG, Switzerland Sergio P.

He is competitive... He wants to win.\u201d I\u2019m tempted to book Infantino for excessive creeping. US President Donald Trump has held a series of meetings with world leaders today, having installed his team in a prime suite in WEF\u2019s congress centre. That includes Swiss Confederation President Simonetta Sommaruga (who criticised the move towards divisive populism during her speech to WEF today). Sommaruga and Trump apparently discussed \u201cbilateral issues and reiterated their interest in boosting trade ties\u201d. ... and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Donald Trump is now enjoying a dinner with top CEOs in Davos, including FIFA President Gianni Infantino, we see.... Harvard economist Ken Rogoff has pulled Kudlow up short, over his claims that countries should just cut tax rates, deregulate, and let the economy run along. Oof! Larry Kudlow agrees that the Federal Reserve is quietly conducting a new quantitative easing scheme, even if it denies it. Donald Trump\u2019s economics expert says that the Fed\u2019s recent policy of buying $60bn of short-term Treasury bills is effectively a stimulus programme The Fed claims it\u2019s simply providing liquidity to keep the plumping of the financial system flowing. But Kudlow isn\u2019t convinced, pointing out that the markets aren\u2019t either! The net effect is that they are expanding the balance sheet, whatever you want to call it. It\u2019s no wonder the stock market and the housing market is rising. Larry Kudlow then hints that the Federal Reserve could consider cutting borrowing costs.... Speaking delicately, he says the Fed has done a good job in 2019, reversing its rate rises in 2018. I wouldn\u2019t mind seeing them be a little bolder. Our short-term rates in and around the Fed Funds market could be a little lower. I wouldn\u2019t want to criticise them, though, Kudlow adds (not that this has ever stopped his boss!). In case anyone missed his message the first time, Kudlow reiterates that: These negative rates are just not helping banks recover. Now that the excitement of Trump vs Thunberg has died down, we can focus on other matters. A heavyweight panel is gathering now, to discuss the threat of a liquidity trap. Gita Gopinath, Chief Economist at the International Monetary Fund, explains that a liquidity trap occurs when there is a massive appetite for liquid assets. That means people will still buy them at very high prices (as we currently see for eurozone sovereign debt, for example). This makes monetary policy ineffective, as interest rates no longer work as a tool. That would be a problem in the next downturn, Gopinath explains, as central banks wouldn\u2019t be able to stimulate growth. This is a timely issue, as interest rates in many countries are at or near record lows! Larry Kudlow, Donald Trump\u2019s chief economic advisor, weighs in -- he says negative interest rates are a bad idea. Negative rates are not a good idea. They\u2019re really bad for banks, they\u2019re really bad for savers, they\u2019re not good for investors. Q: But Donald Trump is envious that other countries get them and the US doesn\u2019t... He\u2019s keener than I am, Kudlow jokes, saying that Trump\u2019s background as a real estate developer means he loves the idea of low rates. Kudlow also warns that monetary stimulus can\u2019t work alone -- countries need to implement lower marginal tax rates to stimulate demand. European countries, and Japan could do \u201ca heck of a lot more\u201d to boost growth, by lowering tax rates, Kudlow insists - suggesting that Trump\u2019s tax-cutting plan has paid off (although growth has actually been below the long-term average of late) I mentioned earlier that Donald Trump\u2019s claim about creating 12,000 factories during his presidency was true... ...well, Rahaf Harfoush, a digital anthropologist here at WEF, tells me that many of these factories would be largely automated - so not creating many new jobs for Americans...... Our Davos heroes of the day are Joe Stiglitz and his partner Anya Schiffrin for drawing up his list of facts about the US economy under Trump....and handing them out liberally today: John Ferguson, Director of country analysis at The Economist Intelligence Unit, has criticised Donald Trump\u2019s attack on climate \u2018prophets of doom\u2019: \u201cMr Trump is clearly wrong on this one. We only have to look at Australia to see the devastating impacts of climate change. The science has been telling us for years that these sort of events will become both more frequent and more severe. The longer people like Mr Trump delay, the more costly and dangerous climate change will be.\u201d Moving on to another important topic, antimicrobial resistance... A biennial report from the Access to Medicine Foundation, an Amsterdam-based non-profit group, has found that many antibiotics are unavailable in poorer countries despite higher infection rates, exacerbating the threat of drug-resistant superbugs. Common infections have become increasingly harder to treat globally. The study, which assesses 30 of the biggest drugmakers on their efforts to address drug-resistant infections, also shows that the number of new treatments being developed for common infectious diseases such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, gonorrhoea and urinary tract infections has fallen \u2013\u2013 to 138 from 175 projects two years ago. The report will be presented at Davos on Thursday. The roundtable discussion will be opened by Bruno Bruins, the Dutch minister for medical care, and moderated by Professor Dame Sally Davies, UK special envoy on antimicrobial resistance and co-convener of the UN interagency coordination group on AMR. Speakers include GSK Vaccines\u2019 chief medical officer Thomas Bruer and Charlotte Petri Gronitzka, UN assistant secretary general and the deputy executive director of partnerships at Unicef. Here is our full story on the study.JK Donald Trump\u2019s claim to the Davos throng that America was enjoying an unprecedented boom might sound good, but unfortunately it doesn\u2019t ring totally true. Economist Ian Shepherdson points out that growth has been below long-term averages of late: Trump could argue that he was citing the duration of the recovery -- the longest ever. But that would mean taking credit for president Obama\u2019s work too... My colleague Larry Elliott also caught up with Nobel prize-winning economist Joe Stiglitz, who said: \u201cResearch shows that Trump normally tells five or six lies a day. He far exceeded that today.\u201d Stiglitz, who had drawn up a list of economic facts for checking purposes, also noted that growth had been faster under Obama and that life expectancy had fallen every year of Trump\u2019s presidency. Trump and Thunberg are battling for the headlines from Davos today.... and the Swedish teenager has the upper hand on the New York Times, we see: It\u2019s been an exciting first day at Davos, where about 3,000 political and business leaders, academics, activists, celebrities and journalists have gathered for the annual World Economic Forum. Appearing on a panel with other young campaigners, Greta Thunberg spoke about the 18 months since she started her climate strike outside the Swedish parliament. She told world leaders to listen to the science, and later said the world is on fire. She urged leaders to act for their children\u2019s sake. In particular, she called for an immediate end to fossil fuel investment and extraction and fossil fuel subsidies, and a general exit from fossil fuels. US president Donald Trump then spoke in the main conference hall (preceded by a traditional Swiss song performed by a group of tenors in national costume) and got some applause from the audience for his pledge to sign the US up to the 1tn tree planting initiative. The eye-catching pledge aside, he used his keynote speech to boast of his (supposed) achievements and declared the US was in \u201cin the midst of an economic boom the likes of which the world has never seen before\u201d. Thunberg responded: \u201cPlanting trees is good, of course, but it\u2019s nowhere near enough.\u201d (she spoke at another panel discussion). Greenpeace was also unimpressed with Trump\u2019s pledge. JK Donald Trump may have pledged to plant more trees, but he\u2019s not been converted to the realities of the climate emergency. During his speech, he took a real swipe at the \u201cperennial prophets of doom\u201d who he claims are too gloomy. Here\u2019s the full section, which shows that the US president has not accepted the message from Greta Thunberg to act now. \u201cThis is not a time for pessimism. This is a time for optimism. To embrace the possibilities of tomorrow, we must reject the perennial prophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse. They are the heirs of yesterday\u2019s foolish fortune tellers. They want to see us do badly, but we don\u2019t let that happen. They predicted an overpopulation crisis in the 1960s, mass starvation in the 70s, and an end of oil in the 1990s. These alarmists always demand the same thing: absolute power to dominate, transform and control every aspect of our lives. We will never let radical socialists destroy our economy, wreck our country or eradicate our liberty.\u201d In a session on the US economy, Trump\u2019s treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin has been challenged over the president\u2019s claim that America is enjoying a boom like no other. Mnuchin is careful neither to repeat Trump\u2019s dubious boast nor to embarrass his boss.\u201dyou have to look at this on a relative basis not an absolute basis\u201d he says, noting that the US has been growing faster while the rest of the world is slowing down. The US has been affected by the global slowdown, the sharp drop in production of Boeing\u2019s 737 Max and a strike at general motors. Mnuchin says that the US trade war with China has not been a factor in slowing the global economy. Intriguingly, he says that the new US-China phase 1 trade accord will boost global growth. Han now turns to the climate emergency. He says the one trillion trees initiative launched at Davos this week is an important step. But he doesn\u2019t seem to be joining it, as Donald Trump did today. Instead, Han says China has already made progress in reforesting, and is \u201cready to share our experience with other countries\u201d. That must be disappointing for the 1t.org movement - who would like as many countries on board as possible. Han ends by repeating his pledge that China is committed to working with other countries to build a better global economy. Vice-president Han then promises that China will open its doors still wider to the word. He doesn\u2019t explicitly name the US, but we know who this passage of his speech is aimed at: Despite the protectionist and unilateral moves by some countries, we will not stop opening up and we will not move in the opposite direction. We are open to buy more high-quality goods from other countries, to encourage balanced trade, he continues. On trade, Han pledges that China will lower tariffs, cut non-tariffs barriers, and create new free trade zones to spur growth. The phase one trade deal between US and China is good for both countries, and for the world Back in the Davos congress hall, the second major speech of the day is underway -- from China\u2019s vice-premier, Han Zheng. He\u2019s a senior figure in Chinese politics - one of Xi Jinping\u2019s deputies. Klaus Schwab is introducing Han, talking about the progress China made since \u201copening up\u201d 40 years ago. China has gone from 1.8% of global GDP to 16% since it joined WEF, Schwab says, which helped to lift people out of poverty. Han then takes the podium, and launches a defence of globalisation. The world economy undergoing a profound adjustment, he says. Globalisation is facing growing attacks, protectionism is spreading, and the risks and uncertainties in global economy are notably on the rise. And he hits out at protectionism (slightly ironic, given China\u2019s track record of protecting its own companies). Here are the key points: Economic globalisation is a trend of history...and a natural result of advances in science and technology. In a world that is so deeply integrated, no country can cope entirely on its own. Rather than blaming globalisation for economic problems, we must develop an \u201cinclusive and open world economy together\u201d. He declares: We should all make the pie of the global economy bigger, and create mechanisms to share the rewards of globalisation better. This way people in all countries can share from the benefits of globalisation and global growth. Political scientist Ian Bremmer detects signs that Davos is preparing for another four years of Trump: If so, that bodes badly for the climate emergency, given he took the US off the Paris Agreement. Dr Frederik Dahlmann, Associate Professor of Sustainability at Warwick Business School, says Greta Thunberg is right to blast Davos for the lack of progress in the last year. He says WEF is an annual ritual of well-meaning talks and speeches, from which little progress flows: \u201cWhile the topics increasingly cover the broader challenges leaders from business and politics face, we have yet to see sufficient efforts to turn these discussions into real-world action. \u201cAssessments of the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals, which include climate change, poverty, decline in biodiversity, social inequalities, peace and justice, suggest that progress is generally slow and uneven. Our world requires strong collection action from actors across business, politics and civil society to achieve the wider ambitions of the Agenda 2030. Chris Giles of the FT was not impressed by Trump\u2019s speech, and its lack of economic rigour: Former UN climate warrier Christiana Figueres has also urged Davos attendees to think about younger generations, and take the necessary action on climate. Figueres, who was the UN\u2019s Executive Secretary on Climate Change, told leaders: \u201cWe devote our life not to climate change. We devote our life to the quality of life our children and grandchildren will have.\u201d Greta Thunberg then outlines three demands to her audience at Davos: Companies, banks, institutions and governments should halt all investment in fossil fuel investment and extraction. immediately end all fossil fuel subsidies and immediately exit from fossil fuels We don\u2019t want it done in 2050, 2030, or even 2021, we want it done now, Thunberg continues. You might think we\u2019re naive, but if you won\u2019t do it, you must explain to your children why you\u2019ve given up on the Paris Agreement goals, and knowingly created a climate crisis, she says. And she completes her speech with an appeal to the global elite\u2019s hearts, as well as minds: Our house is still on fire. Your inaction is fuelling the flames by the hour. And we\u2019re asking you to act as if you love your children more than anything else. Thunberg now warns that the world is still on fire, due to lack of progress from world leaders. \u201cThis is not not about right and left. We couldn\u2019t care less about your party politics,\u201d Thunberg continues (she\u2019s being heard in absolute silence), From a sustainability perspective, the right, the left, and the centre have all failed. No political ideology or economic structure has managed to tackle the climate and environmental emergency and create a cohesive and sustainable world. Because that world, in case you hadn\u2019t noticed, is currently on fire. Elsewhere in Davos, Greta Thunberg is speaking about the climate emergency again - to another packed room. She begins with a pointed reminder that little has happened since she wowed WEF in 2019. One year ago, I came to Davos and told you that our house is on fire. I said I wanted you to panic. I\u2019d been warned that telling people to panic about the climate crisis is a very dangerous thing to do. But don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s fine. Trust me, I\u2019ve done this before, and I can assure you that it doesn\u2019t lead to anything. And for the record, when children tell you to panic, we\u2019re not telling you to go on like before. Thunberg adds that: We\u2019re not telling you to rely on technologies that don\u2019t exist at scale yet, and perhaps never will. We\u2019re not asking you to cheat and fiddle numbers, or offset your emissions by just paying someone to plant trees in Africa while the Amazon is chopped down, Thunburg continues. And she also puts Trump\u2019s one trillion trees pledge in its place: Planting trees is good, of course, but it\u2019s nowhere near enough, and it cannot replace real mitigation and rewilding nature. We don\u2019t need to lower emissions....Emissions need to stop. Jennifer Morgan, Greenpeace\u2019s executive director, isn\u2019t wowed by Trump\u2019s performance, though. The one trillion trees initiative doesn\u2019t make up for the lack of a wider attack on the climate emergency, she tells us. Morgan says Trump still doesn\u2019t appear to understand the crisis: To assume that you can have a great, profitable America, and happy Americans without understanding the risk to Americans from climate change is astounding. It just demonstrates the level of denial, and the capture of this government by the coal, oil and gas industries. So what should Trump, or his successor, be doing? \u201cHe should be putting in place a comprehensive, socially just, climate plan that would drive emissions down to zero by 2040, and would leave fossil fuels in the ground.\u201d Rich Buckley, AstraZeneca\u2019s global corporate affairs chief, is also pleased to hear Trump back the trillion-trees pledge today. He tells us: The applause [for Trump\u2019s pledge]...demonstrates that it is a message that appeals to a global audience. An optimistic, action-oriented approach is one that is well received. Trump\u2019s pledge to join the one trillion trees initiative is probably the best news out of his speech. This is an effort to plant 1 trillion trees across the globe; boosting reforestation would suck up carbon dioxide, and combat raising global temperatures. We just caught up with Marc Benioff, head of Salesforce, who says he\u2019s excited by Trump\u2019s move. I\u2019m very excited by the trillion trees, and that the US is joining 1t.org. It\u2019s very important for the future that we sequester 200 gigatons as fast as possible. Hopefully we\u2019ll hear the same thing from the Chinese later today, Benioff adds (vice-premier Han Zheng is addressing Davos). Wow. That\u2019s quite a pledge from Trump. It\u2019ll be interesting to see how Greta Thunberg responds. There is some scepticism on Twitter whether the US president will honour this promise, though. Earlier, Marc Benioff, the American internet entrepreneur (and a billionaire), tweeted that his cloud computing company Salesforce would plant 100m trees. Does he have a message for Greta Thunberg? Trump reiterates that he is a \u201cbig believer in the environment\u201d and that the US will join in a global initiative to plant a trillion trees. (A Swiss study published in the journal Science last year suggested fighting global heating by planting a trillion trees.) He adds: What I want is the cleanest water and the cleanest air. Outside the conference hall, Trump speaks to reporters. He reckons his speech was \u201cwell received\u201d and notes that \u201c200 of the biggest companies in the world were in the room\u201d \u2013 many of which will be investing in the US, he claims. That means jobs, that means economic development. We are doing well and we are going to do a lot better. The US president has finished his speech. I\u2019m not sure anyone\u2019s expected Notre Dame to feature, but Trump is now hailing the inspiringly reaction to its recent fire. With an eye on November\u2019s election, Trump is now attacking \u201cradical socialism\u201d... In a thinly-veiled dig at Greta Thunberg and other climate protesters, Trump says We must reject the perennial prophets of doom. This is not a time for pessimism. This is a time for optimism. But make no mistake, before he entered the conference hall the US president claimed he cared deeply about the environment. I\u2019m a big believer in the environment. The environment to me is very important. Importantly, the US president then signs the US up to the 1 trillion tree initiative -- to plant about a trillion trees around the world. On Brexit, Trump says he hopes to agree a tremendous trade deal with the UK, adding that PM Boris Johnson also wants to do this. The US president has praise for the UK\u2019s leader Boris Johnson, calling him \u201ca wonderful new prime minister\u201d who \u201cwants very much to make a deal\u201d on trade [following Brexit]. Trump has a pop at the Obama administration, talking about the \u201cwreckage\u201d that he inherited. On to trade... Trump says negotiations with China on a Phase Two trade deal will start shortly. Last week, the world\u2019s two biggest economies finally signed the long-awaited Phase One agreement. Our relationship with China has right now probably never been better. We went through a rough patch... ... but now we love each other, he says, referring to China\u2019s leader. Julia Kollewe taking over Trump continues to trumpet his achievements, now turning to families with children, saying his administration had doubled child tax credit for 40m American families. He then adds America has some of the lowest taxes in the world. Tremendous wealth is pouring into areas that for 100 years saw nothing. There is no better place on earth than the United States. No Trump speech is complete without a pop at the US central bank. The president says that the economic boom has happened \u201cdespite\u201d the US Federal Reserve, which \u201craised rates too fast and cut them too slowly\u201d. The time for scepticism is over. People are flowing back, he says, thanking business leaders who have moved factories into the US. I hold up the American model as an example to the world, Trump declares. Pro worker, pro citizen, and pro family. America is enjoying a blue-collar boom, Trump insists, citing wage data showing that those at the bottom are seeing stronger wage growth. He tells his audience of global elite: The American dream is back, bigger and better than before 60,000 factories we\u2019re lost under the last administration, and we\u2019ve gained 12,000 on my watch, Trump adds (a claim that was rated as broadly true recently). We\u2019ve gained 7 million jobs since I took over, Trump continues -- saying he had this target in his head when he took over but didn\u2019t mention it (hmmm). The president cites the good progress on unemployment, for minority groups and women. And he then claims to be tackling inequality and spreading wealth. That\u2019s questionable, given the world\u2019s top billionaires (many Americans) became 25% richer last year. Trump takes the podium, saying it\u2019s an honour to be at WEF. And he\u2019s straight into banging the drum about how well America is doing. I\u2019m proud to say that the US is in an economic boom, the likes of which the world has never seen before, says Trump. America is thriving, flourishing, and winning like never before, he continues, citing the trade deals signed last week with China, and Mexico-Canada. Those deals are a model for the 21st century, he claims He claims the US was flagging when he took over, and that pessimism had taken root among business leaders and other influential figures. But under his watch, things are improving..... Here comes Donald Trump! Klaus Schwab is welcoming the US president back to the stage, for the second time (after 2018). It is an honour to host you, Mr President, says Schwab -- who has never knowingly under-flattered a world leader. Over the last three years, the US economy has enjoyed growth and dynamism, Schwab continues, citing stock market growth, and the very low unemployment rate in the US Words alone cannot capture the scene.... In a classic \u2018only at Davos\u2019 moment, a group of Swiss musicians have appeared on stage in full national costume. They\u2019re singing a much-loved Swiss anthem, rather movingly (anything to break the boredom in and outside the hall). Outside the Congress Hall, a large crowd are gathered near to a white double door where president Trump should soon appear. Our live feed isn\u2019t broken, don\u2019t worry. It simply lacks a president.... The WEF are now showing a video about the loss of biodiversity, and how use of pesticides mean bees are dying out. Simonetta Sommaruga, president of the Swiss Confederation, is calling for action, saying it is a mistake to place economic interests above the functioning of the natural world. Biodiversity is like the Eiffel Tower, she says. Take away one screw a day, and nothing happens at first. But then you take away one too many....and everything collapses. Sommaruga also launches a stirring attack on populism, saying she looks at the state of the world with concern. Passions are being stirred to achieve political goals, through the use of intolerance, hatred and revenge, she says. Over to you, president Trump..... Klaus Schwabb, founder of the World Economic Forum (50 years ago!) is on the stage now. He tells the audience of \u201cglobal stake holders\u201d that there is a \u201cgeneral loss of trust and confidence among people, along with profound pessimism and cynicism\u201d. But each of us can help create a better world, Schwabb insists, whether you\u2019re a politician, business leader, the head of an NGO, an activist, a cultural leader or a young person. That\u2019s certainly what four young people -- Greta Thunberg, Natasha Mwansa, Salvador G\u00f3mez-Col\u00f3n and Autumn Peltier -- demanded this morning. Schwabb is now giving a gushing welcome to the Swiss president for all the help keeping Davos going all these years. Trump must be along soon.... While we wait for Donald Trump, here\u2019s our news story on Greta Thunberg\u2019s call for climate action. Cambridge classics professor Mary Beard adds that she\u2019s hoping to encourage the global elite to think about history during her time at Davos: History isn\u2019t going to solve the world\u2019s problems, but it can help you think about the world\u2019s problems in a more complicated and subtle way. She also suggests we shouldn\u2019t dismiss Davos as simply a place for partying. Some good can come out of it too, she tells me (before heading towards the Trump speech). Every time you hear it on the news, it\u2019s \u2018Mr So-and-So is at the schmooze-fest at Davos\u2019. Maybe it is..but there\u2019s worst things to do than schmoozing, if actually what you\u2019re doing is talking and thinking hard at the same time. I just ran into top academic Mary Beard in the Davos scrum. She\u2019s no fan of Trump, of course, but argues that it\u2019s better for people on different sides to be talking. It\u2019s her first Davos; not as monocultural and blokish as she expected, apparently As in 2018, Trump is hogging all the limelight at Davos - and he\u2019s not even here yet! But he must be close... The Davos congress hall is filling up with delegates waiting to listen to Trump. Many of the rest are hanging around outside for a glimpse of the president\u2019s arrival... No sign of Trump yet, but there\u2019s a growing buzz in the Congress Centre ahead of his arrival. People have bene queuing to get into the congress hall for an hour Heads-up. US President Donald Trump has arrived in Switzerland to attend the World Economic Forum. Air Force One landed at Zurich Airport shortly after dawn this morning. The passengers then transferred to a flock of helicopters for the 45 minute journey up the mountains to Davos (the train would be more environmentally friendly...). According to the White House press pool, Trump boarded Marine One, which lifted off at 8:51 am Davos time (7.51am GMT). Salvador G\u00f3mez-Col\u00f3n, who organized Light and Hope for Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria, chides the media for paying too much attention to inconsequential stories, rather than issues that really matter. Finally, fellow teenage activist Autumn Peltier (who has been campaigning for cleaner water since she was 8) wraps up the session with some sage advice: If you have an idea, or a solution, or a way you can help us, just do it. And that\u2019s a wrap. Four young activists have got this year\u2019s WEF underway, with a display of passion and determination that the rest of Davos will struggle to match. Q: So how do you all deal with the haters? Autumn Peltier says she and her mother get a lot of negative comments -- and they ignore it. Greta Thunberg sweeps the question aside, and produces a statement she\u2019d like to read instead. She cites the IPCC report on climate change from 2018, which explained how few years are left to act if there\u2019s a 67% chance of keeping the global temperature rise to below 1.5%. With today\u2019s emissions levels, the remaining budget is gone in less than eight years. These aren\u2019t anyone\u2019s views, this is the science. Thunberg adds that such forecasts doesn\u2019t include feedback loops and tipping points, and also often assume that \u201cfuture generations will somehow suck hundreds of billions of tonnes of CO2 out of the atmosphere, even though such technology doesn\u2019t exist yet.\u201d She tells Davos: I\u2019ve been repeating these numbers at nearly every speech I\u2019ve given for the last 18 months. I know you don\u2019t want to report about these numbers, but I\u2019ll keep saying them until you do, Thunberg concludes. Q: What can the media do better to help young activists? Natasha Mwanga says the media has the power to put us at the centre of the conversation. But they only focus on stories for a couple of days, then get bored and drop them. She points out that the media has huge power, as the \u2018fourth estate\u2019. Journalists should use that power to \u201cbring us hope\u201d. Autumn Peltier makes another good point -- on the damaging impact of negative comments online. If you want to say something bad about us, just don\u2019t. Q: Do activists feel they are being heard enough? Greta gives the audience the giggles, by pointing out that she doesn\u2019t have a problem here. I can\u2019t complain about being heard, I\u2019m being heard all the time. But science isn\u2019t at the centre of the conversation, and it needs to be. Q: So what needs to happen to tackle environmental and social issues that you all care about? Canadian water activist Autumn Peltier says that we need more people, children and adults, to make their voices heard. Speaking at the World Economic Forum today will help, she says, as it\u2019s a global stage for young activists. But she also warns not to simply hand activists awards, instead of listening to them. I don\u2019t want your awards... Award me by making the changes I want to see, Peltier adds. Salvador G\u00f3mez-Col\u00f3n has a neat idea -- young activists could \u201cmentor leaders\u201d, and give them the knowledge and skills they need. Natasha Mwansa adds that young activists could consider more practical action, rather than limiting their work to posting on social media. Natasha Wang Mwansa, the 18-year old women\u2019s and girls\u2019 activist from Zambia, has issued a loud warning to the global elite that young activists are determined to change the world. We are able to step out and say \u2018this is what we want\u2019, explains Mwansa. \u201cWe haven\u2019t let our age stop us.\u201d And she wins whooping and clapping from the packed-out audience by declaring: The older generation has experience, but we have ideas and energy. Speaking passionately and engagingly, Mwansa says that we should put young activists in the same room as the UN secretary-general - so they can use work together and his power for good. Salvador G\u00f3mez-Col\u00f3n weights in here too, saying that young activists are tired of being given promises that aren\u2019t delivered. Salvador G\u00f3mez-Col\u00f3n, the 16-year old activist from San Juan, Puerto Rico, speaks next. He says world leaders need to stop treating climate change as a political issue, a social-economic issue or a racial issue. The climate crisis just is. And until we address that, we\u2019re not getting anywhere. G\u00f3mez-Col\u00f3n then warns his audience that the young activists are not going to wait five, 10 or 20 years to execute change.. We\u2019re not the future, we\u2019re the present. And we\u2019re acting now. Clean water advocate Autumn Peltier, speaks next. Peltier, a member of the Wikwemikong First Nation, says she has seen a lot more youths standing up for issues that matter, since she challenged Canadian PM Justin Trudeau at the age of 12 We have the courage to raise our voices, she says. The panel begins with a short film about the new wave of young climate activists around the globe -- it\u2019s pretty inspiring, and gets a round of applause from the assembled audience. Greta Thunberg then speaks about the remarkable 18 months since she started her climate strike. Lots has happened that no-one could have predicted, and this has started a movement, she tells WEF. It\u2019s not just me, she add modestly, it is lots of young people around the world who have created an \u2018alliance of movements\u2019. People are more aware now. It feels like the climate and environment is a hot topic now, thanks to young people pushing. But at the same time, nothing has been achieved, because global emissions are still going up, Thunberg points out. So what needs to happen? We need to start listening to the science, and treat this crisis with the importance it deserve, she insists, adding: Without treating this as a real crisis we cannot solve it. Greta\u2019s panel is the youngest ever convened at the World Economic Forum, if you exclude moderator Edward Felsenthal of Time Magazine (Felsenthal jokes). WEF\u2019s panel session on creating a sustainable path towards a better world is starting now. The room is packed. Greta Thunberg is joined by: Salvador G\u00f3mez-Col\u00f3n, who raised funds and awareness after Hurricane Mar\u00eda devastated his native Puerto Rico in 2017. Natasha Mwansa, a campaigner for women\u2019s and girls\u2019 rights from Zambi Autumn Peltier, Chief Water Commissioner for the Anishinabek Nation of indigenous people in Canada. As usual, there\u2019s bumper-to-bumper traffic on the streets of Davos, as the global elite are shuttled around in luxury limos or in \u2018green\u2019 shuttle-buses. There\u2019s also a strong security presence -- I saw about a dozen soldiers, some armed, as I scuttled along the icy pavements to the Congress Centre. There\u2019s the usual high security on the entrances to WEF too (airport-style scanners, no liquids allowed). Davos\u2019s main street, the Promenade, has been invaded by corporations - they\u2019ve paid massive sums to turn tourist shops or cafes into their base for the week. Greta is in the building....ready for her first panel session in 15 minutes time or so. Good morning from Davos, where the 50th World Economic Forum is getting underway. Around 3,000 heads of state, business chiefs, academics, activists, celebrities and journalists have descended for their annual splurge of meetings, speeches, parties, top-level discussions and general pontificating. And today could be dominated by two extremely different individuals, who are both changing the world in their own way. In one corner, US president Donald Trump. He\u2019ll give the first keynote speech this morning - a chance to tub-thump his America First agenda, trumpet his (limited) trade deal with China, and hail the ongoing US economic expansion. The Americans are in town in force. Trump has brought a large delegation, including Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin and White House advisor Larry Kudlow. But across the congress centre, climate activist Greta Thunberg will also be in the spotlight. She\u2019s demanding that governments and corporations wake up to the climate emergency, and take decisive action before our futures are ruined. As Thunberg and allies wrote in the Guardian last week: We demand that at this year\u2019s forum, participants from all companies, banks, institutions and governments immediately halt all investments in fossil fuel exploration and extraction, immediately end all fossil fuel subsidies and immediately and completely divest from fossil fuels. We don\u2019t want these things done by 2050, 2030 or even 2021, we want this done now \u2013 as in right now. The climate emergency is a massive issue at Davos this week. WEF\u2019s own Risks Report shows that it\u2019s the biggest long-term risk facing the world economy. But there\u2019s lots of other issues on the agenda too, including the state of the world economy, the technology arms race, and mental health. Huawei\u2019s founder, Ren Zhengfei, is in town -- just as the UK weighs up whether to use its 5G technology despite US opposition. Ren has a lot on his mind. Yesterday, his daughter Meng Wanzhou appeared in a Vancouver court to start her extradition trial over charges of fraud and sanctions violations. The agenda 8.30am Davos / 7.30am GMT: Creating a sustainable path towards a common future, including Greta Thunberg, 9.45am Davos / 8.45am GMT: Huawei\u2019s Founder, Ren Zhengfei, on a panel discussing the tech arms race 11.30am Davos / 10.30am GMT: Donald Trump\u2019s special address 1pm Davos: noon GMT: A panel session on the \u2018averting the climate apocalypse\u2019, including Greta Thunberg 2.15pm Davos / 1.15pm GMT: Chinese vice-premier Han Zheng\u2019s special address 2.30pm Davos/ 1.30pm GMT: US treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin on a US economy session 3pm Davos / 2pm GMT: Indian actress Deepika Padukone discusses mental health(3pm GMT) 4pm Davos / 3pm GMT: Solving the green growth equation, with Bank of England governor Mark Carney, economist Mariana Mazzucato, and Greenpeace\u2019s Jennifer Morgan 5.15pm Davos / 4.15pm GMT: A session on \u2018escaping the liquidity trap\u2019 with White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow and IMF chief economist Gita Gopinath",

          "bodyText": "The closely watched case of Meng Wanzhou is due to start in Vancouver as the Huawei executive battles extradition amid growing tensions between Canada and China. The hearings, scheduled to begin on Monday and last five days at British Columbia\u2019s supreme court, will centre on \u201cdouble criminality\u201d \u2013 the legal notion that Meng\u2019s extradition to the US requires her alleged actions also be considered a crime in Canada. It marks the first phase in what is likely to be a protracted battle: Meng\u2019s team is also expected to argue US and Canadian authorities conspired against her, breaching her rights when Canadian border guards detained her for hours prior to her arrest by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in December 2018 on suspicion of fraud and breaching US sanctions on Iran. Government lawyers in Canada allege Meng lied about her company\u2019s dealings with Iran when speaking to prospective investors at large banks, potentially putting them at risk of breaching the US sanctions. This deception, they say, amounts to fraud. The defence counters that Canada does not have the same sanctions against Iran, so any banks working with Meng would not have fallen foul of restrictions. If Justice Heather Holmes sides with the government, it increases the likelihood Meng could be sent to the US to face bank fraud and wire fraud charges. But if her lawyers are able to argue the threshold of double criminality has not been met, the extradition proceedings would in effect end. The Huawei chief financial officer was arrested more than a year ago as she travelled from Hong Kong to a conference in Argentina, stopping briefly in Vancouver. Meng is currently living in Vancouver, under house arrest after securing a $10m bail. She is required to wear a GPS tracking device and has a curfew, but is able to travel freely around the city. Hours before the start of the hearings, China condemned the proceedings, highlighting tense relations between the two countries. \u201cWe urge the Canadian government again to take China\u2019s stance and concerns seriously, take tangible action to correct its mistakes, release Ms Meng without further delay and ensure her safe return to China,\u201d said foreign ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang. Meng\u2019s court appearance comes amid growing concern in Canada over the detention of two Canadians in China, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, who were charged with espionage in May. The pair were arrested days after Canada executed the warrant for Meng \u2013 a move largely seen as retributive from China. Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has long demanded the two be released, but the two remain in detention.",

          "bodyText": "Iran will send the black box flight recorders from the passenger jet it accidentally shot down abroad for analysis, a senior investigator has said. The recorders will first be sent to Ukraine, the plane\u2019s home base, where French, Canadian and US experts will help examine them, the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported. They are reportedly badly damaged, and could be sent on to France if the team in Kyiv are not able to read the flight data, Hassan Rezaeifer, head of accident investigations for Iran\u2019s civil aviation department, was quoted as saying. All 176 people on board the Ukraine International Airlines Boeing 737-800 were killed when the plane came down, with many of them being Iranian citizens or of Iranian heritage. Tehran denied for several days that it had shot the plane down. The belated admission that its Revolutionary Guards were responsible has sparked protests across the country, from people angry about the deception as well as the deaths. Iran had also initially insisted that it would not send the black boxes overseas for investigation, despite pressure from the Ukrainian authorities and the governments of other countries who lost citizens in the crash. Fifty-seven of the dead were from Canada, and the country\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has been pushing hard for a full investigation. He said on Friday that France was one of a handful of countries with the technical expertise needed to extract information from the black boxes. Other victims included 11 Ukrainians, 17 Swedish citizens, four Afghans and four British citizens. All countries are seeking a full investigation, and compensation to the families of the dead. The shooting came hours after Iran targeted US airbases in Iraq with ballistic missiles, in retaliation for the killing of Gen Qassem Suleimani, Iran\u2019s top commander and the most influential military figure in the Middle East. Iranian officials have blamed lower-level commanders for the \u201cunforgivable mistake\u201d, claiming they mistook the plane for a US missile fired in response to Iran\u2019s earlier attacks. The plane was designed and built in the US, and its engine by a joint US-French venture. Investigators from both countries have been invited to take part in the probe. On Friday, Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, delivered a rare sermon in Tehran in which he called the shooting down of the plane a \u201cbitter tragedy that burned through our heart\u201d. But in an apparent response to Donald Trump\u2019s expression of support for protesters, he described the US president as a \u201cclown\u201d who pretended to support the Iranian people but would push a poisonous dagger into their backs. \u2022 This article was amended on 20 January 2020 because an earlier version incorrectly referred to Justin Trudeau as Canada\u2019s president. He is that country\u2019s prime minister.",

The case raises the prospect of her father giving evidence against her. Meghan\u2019s half-sister, Samantha Markle, told the BBC: \u201cIf he\u2019s called, he will come.\u201d</p> \n<p>Ahead of his appearance, in a video on the couple\u2019s Instagram account, Harry launched the tournament\u2019s mental fitness charter, saying: \u201cRugby league isn\u2019t just a sport, it\u2019s a community. And one that takes care of its own.\u201d</p> \n<p>He said he was proud to launch the charter. \u201cThis charter will build on the brilliant work already happening in rugby league by committing to training and educating all those involved in the tournament, and the wider rugby league family, not only in how they can look after their own mental fitness but also support others to do the same.\u201d</p>",

          "bodyText": "The Duke of Sussex has appeared in public for the first time since announcing he and his wife are to step back as frontline royals. Prince Harry returned to Buckingham Palace, the heart of the institution rocked by the bombshell announcement last week that he and Meghan would leave their senior roles as full-time royals and move part-time to Canada. His first official engagement, as he and Meghan began a period of \u201ctransition\u201d, was to conduct the draw for the Rugby League World Cup 2021, and announce a mental fitness charter for the tournament. Before the draw for the men\u2019s, women\u2019s and wheelchair tournaments, Harry met schoolchildren on a makeshift rugby pitch in the palace\u2019s back garden. One of the assembled reporters shouted to him: \u201cHow are the discussions going on your future?\u201d Harry, who was making his way into the palace, only smiled at one of his entourage and did not reply. A video of behind-the-scenes footage of Harry\u2019s engagement was posted on the Sussexes\u2019 Instagram feed edited to the soundtrack of the Stone Roses\u2019 This Is the One. Commenters, referencing that the song\u2019s lyrics contain the line \u201cI\u2019d like to leave the country, For a month of Sundays\u201d, speculated if there was a subliminal message in this choice. Meanwhile his wife, almost 5,000 miles away in Canada, has undertaken private visits to two women\u2019s organisations in Vancouver, with photographs of her appearing on social media sites. Harry\u2019s appearance, as patron of the Rugby Football League, could be his last in public in the UK for the immediate future as he prepares to join Meghan, and the couple\u2019s baby son Archie, in Vancouver. It is thought he has some private engagements in the UK early next week, but nothing in the official diary after that. The engagement also raises questions over how he and Meghan intend to honour their commitments as patrons to their organisations if they are to spend significant amounts of their time in Canada. The Queen, who has given a reluctant blessing to the couple\u2019s plans, has asked that senior aides find workable solutions to the complex issues involved in the couple\u2019s future in days, not weeks. These include how the couple intend to fulfil their ambition to earn an income, and who will pay for their armed personal protection, as they carve out new \u201cprogressive\u201d roles. Following Monday\u2019s family summit at Sandringham, the Queen announced the duke and duchess would undertake a \u201cperiod of transition\u201d , splitting time between the UK and Canada, as they work to become \u201cfinancially independent\u201d of the taxpayer. But though Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has said the majority of Canadians would welcome the Queen\u2019s grandson and his wife, the message was less encouraging elsewhere, indicating significant challenges for the couple as they enter their brave new world. The Globe and Mail, the country\u2019s biggest-selling national newspaper, urged the Canadian government to deny the couple\u2019s request to move there. \u201cOur royals don\u2019t live here. They reign from a distance,\u201d it said in an editorial. \u201cA royal living in this country does not accord with the long-standing nature of the relationship between Canada and Britain, and Canada and the Crown. \u201cThis country\u2019s unique monarchy, and its delicate yet essential place in our constitutional system, means that a royal resident \u2026 is not something that Canada can allow. \u201cCanada is not a halfway house for anyone looking to get out of Britain while remaining a royal. \u201cIn response to the sudden announcement of a vague and evolving plan for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex to move to Canada while remaining part of the royal family, the Trudeau government\u2019s response should be simple and succinct: No.\u201d It remains unclear how the couple intend to operate as semi-detached royals, but Meghan hasmade two private visits to women\u2019s organisations in Vancouver. Kate Gibson, from the Downtown Eastside women\u2019s centre, said she had received an email on Monday from an unknown person, who turned out to be an \u201cassistant\u201d to the duchess, asking if a VIP could drop in on Tuesday. Meghan also visited the Justice for Girls organisation, which posted two black and white photographs of her having tea on its site. Gibson told Canadian media Meghan had stayed for one hour, and discussed issues such as women\u2019s housing and welfare. \u201cWe found her to be very genuine, just really comfortable,\u201d she said. The photographs were posted as the Mail on Sunday filed its defence documents to legal action by the duchess for publishing extracts from a letter she wrote to her estranged father, Thomas Markle. The case raises the prospect of her father giving evidence against her. Meghan\u2019s half-sister, Samantha Markle, told the BBC: \u201cIf he\u2019s called, he will come.\u201d Ahead of his appearance, in a video on the couple\u2019s Instagram account, Harry launched the tournament\u2019s mental fitness charter, saying: \u201cRugby league isn\u2019t just a sport, it\u2019s a community. And one that takes care of its own.\u201d He said he was proud to launch the charter. \u201cThis charter will build on the brilliant work already happening in rugby league by committing to training and educating all those involved in the tournament, and the wider rugby league family, not only in how they can look after their own mental fitness but also support others to do the same.\u201d",

          "bodyText": "When a Canadian business magnate sent off a flurry of tweets blaming Donald Trump for provoking the crisis which eventually led to the accidental shooting-down of a Ukrainian passenger jet, the posts quickly went viral. Michael McCain, the billionaire CEO of Maple Leaf Foods, used the company\u2019s branded Twitter account to describe the US president as a \u201cnarcissist\u201d and described the 176 passengers and crew as \u201ccollateral damage\u201d from Trump\u2019s \u201cirresponsible, dangerous, ill-conceived behaviour\u201d. It was a potentially risky move for a company employing 24,000 people and with operations in the United States, but the thread was liked more than 70,000 times on Twitter \u2013 suggesting that his comments had struck a nerve in Canada. Iran has admitted accidentally shooting down the plane, which was carrying 57 Canadian citizens. However, McCain\u2019s tweets highlight one strand of Canada\u2019s response to the disaster \u2013 the latest in a string of events in which the country has found itself caught up in feuds between the Trump administration and other countries. Justin Trudeau seemed to acknowledge such frustrations on Monday, when he said that the victims of the disaster would still be alive were it not for a recent crisis partly triggered by Trump\u2019s decision to kill Iran\u2019s top general, Qassem Suleimani. \u201cI think if there were no tensions, if there was no escalation recently in the region, those Canadians would be right now home with their families,\u201d he said. As a close ally of the US \u2013 and its largest trading partner \u2013 Canada has always been especially vulnerable to the ebbs and flows of policy decisions made in Washington DC. Such sensitivity has only heightened under the current administration. \u201cCanadians might not be holding Donald Trump directly responsible for this attack, but I believe there is increasing concern among Canadians that we are the collateral damage in erratic decisions made by the Trump administration,\u201d said Stephanie Carvin, a professor of international relations at Carleton University. \u201cThere\u2019s no real forethought from this administration in how policy might affect allies. And really there\u2019s no afterthought to how they might ameliorate the damage that comes from these situations.\u201d Canada was one of the first victims of Trump\u2019s aggressive trade policy, when the US slapped tariffs on aluminum and steel imports on the grounds of national security. And since then, the pain has only escalated. In August 2018, Canada prompted a furious response from Saudi Arabia after it criticized the kingdom\u2019s stance on human rights. Saudi Arabia expelled Canadian diplomats, recalled medical students and cut off trade \u2013 but the US refrained from comment. \u201cThe fact that the Trump administration didn\u2019t defend us, was probably the first indication that this might be a serious challenge for Canada,\u201d said Carvin. In December 2018, Canada responded to a US arrest warrant and detained Huawei\u2019s chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, on suspicion of fraud. Bound by an extradition treaty between the two nations, Canada had no choice, but the consequences have been disastrous for the country. Shortly afterwards, two Canadian citizens \u2013 Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor \u2013 were arrested in China, a move widely viewed as retaliation for Meng\u2019s arrest. Both men remain in custody. Relations between China and Canada remain in the deep freeze, and a free trade deal \u2013 worth billions of dollars \u2013 was shelved. While Trudeau has spoken with Trump about the pain Canada has suffered \u2013 especially around the two detained citizens \u2013 little progress has been made in freeing Spavor and Kovrig. \u201cIt\u2019s not helpful if the president of the United States says he\u2019ll say something to China and then doesn\u2019t follow through because he\u2019s more interested in getting a trade deal than he is in freeing the two Canadians,\u201d said Carvin. \u201cChina knows this and can use this as leverage against us.\u201d With his seemingly freewheel approach to policy, Trump has often left Canada officials scrambling to assess the impacts of his decisions. \u201cWe can predict the coming consequences of many of his actions, massive and momentous and obvious,\u201d wrote former diplomat Scott Gilmore in a Maclean\u2019s magazine article linking the crash to US policy in the Middle East. \u201cBut, in our inherently chaotic and unstable world, the impact of others, like withdrawing from the Paris agreement, are less immediate and recognizable and it may take us decades to fully appreciate the tornadoes to come.\u201d With much of the focus within Canada dedicated to navigating US foreign policy and not on its own, Canada has sidelined its own priorities, including pursuing a security council seat at the UN. \u201cWe have benefited so much from the protection of the United States,\u201d said Carvin. \u201cBut we\u2019re starting to see what the world looks like when that protection isn\u2019t there.\u201d",

For each level of masculinity, bearded men were deemed more attractive than clean shaven men, a result found for both short-term and, to a slightly greater degree, long-term relationships. But not everyone was drawn to a hairy face. Among other results, the team found that women who had higher levels of disgust for ectoparasites found beards less attractive, although the reverse was true for those concerned about picking up harmful bacteria or viruses. While the latter link was weak, the team write: \u201cThis could be interpreted as evidence that facial hair is preferred as a marker of health among women with high pathogen concerns, or that facial hair masks areas of the face that would communicate ill health.\u201d Whether participants were aware of a small study published last year that suggested men\u2019s beards might harbour more germs than dog fur was unclear. The study has limitations: all of the male faces were of northern European ethnicity, and most of the women were white and lived in the US. It is also not clear whether the results would hold for gay men, or women of other sexual orientations. Lee said that despite the findings men should stick with what they were most comfortable with. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t base the decision to grow a beard on the results of a single study,\u201d he said. Christopher Watkins, from Abertay University, Dundee, an expert in social judgments of faces, who was not involved in the study, suggested further studies might explore whether men chose to cultivate facial hair if it were deemed sexier. The authors of the study reveal that previous research into London fashions suggested facial hair was more common when there were more men than women available in the marriage market. \u201cThe research advances work on individual differences in women\u2019s attractiveness judgments, in this case, by focusing on facial cues that men can easily change \u2013 beards \u2013 in addition to how \u2018masculine\u2019 his face looks,\u201d said Watkins. \u201cFindings such as this might raise interesting questions in future about the uptake and nature of male grooming practices for example if different men from different cultures or regions are responsive to the high or low \u2018value\u2019 of a beard in making a good first impression.\u201d",

          "bodyText": "The Duchess of Sussex did not take part in the Queen\u2019s Sandringham summit to decide future roles for herself and Prince Harry, it has emerged, as the remaining full-time working royals returned to their round of official engagements. Before Monday\u2019s crisis family meeting, sources had indicated Meghan was likely to be personally involved in the urgent discussions precipitated by the couple\u2019s shock announcement that they intended to \u201cstep back\u201d from frontline royal duties. She had been expected to participate via conference call from Vancouver Island, in Canada, to which she flew back on Thursday to be with the couple\u2019s young son, Archie, and their two dogs which have been flown out. The couple are said to have decided Meghan\u2019s direct input was not necessary for the highly confidential meeting, hosted by the Queen, understood to have been led by the Prince of Wales, and attended by Princes William and Harry. A palace source said: \u201cIn the end, the Sussexes decided it wasn\u2019t necessary for the duchess to join.\u201d Harry was left to argue the couple\u2019s case on his own, which was the first time all four senior royals had met face-to-face following the couple\u2019s unexpected statement last Wednesday. Confirmation that it was the couple\u2019s decision for Meghan not to take part will stymie speculative reports she had been deliberately excluded, aides will hope. Buckingham Palace has yet to reveal full details of how the Sussexes might achieve their goal of splitting time between the UK and Canada, stepping back as senior royals, and becoming financially independent by earning an income unfettered by royal constraints. As senior palace officials concentrated on nailing the fine print, the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, revealed the federal Canadian government had not been involved \u201cup until this point\u201d about what the couple\u2019s move there would mean.

          "bodyText": "Good morning, I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s essential stories. Friction between progressive candidates as first 2020 votes loom The progressive senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have long considered each other friends. The two even met in Washington in late 2018 to discuss maintaining good relations as they prepared to launch their 2020 presidential campaigns. But as the first primary votes approach, tensions between the two camps have spilled into the open, with Warren claiming a resurgent Sanders told her at that meeting that he did not believe a woman could beat Donald Trump \u2013 a claim Sanders described as \u201cludicrous\u201d. Cory Booker. The New Jersey senator on Monday became the latest high-profile candidate to drop out of the 2020 presidential race, citing a lack of funds \u2013 and leaving the little-fancied late entrant Deval Patrick as the only African American in the field. Russian hackers. A US cybersecurity firm has claimed Russian military hackers tried to steal internal emails from Burisma, the Ukrainian energy firm that employed Hunter Biden which was at the centre of attempts by Trump last July to pressure Ukrainian authorities to announce an investigation into the Bidens for purported corruption, an effort that has led to the president being impeached. Pompeo claims Suleimani killing is part of bigger strategy The Trump administration has again altered its justification for the killing of Qassem Suleimani, with the US secretary of state saying the Iranian general\u2019s assassination was part of a broader strategy to deter US foes, including China and Russia. Speaking at Stanford University on Monday, Mike Pompeo made no mention of the White House\u2019s original assertion that Suleimani had been plotting imminent attacks on US assets. Pompeo has declined to attend a House foreign affairs committee hearing on the killing, set for Tuesday. Canadian victims. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has said the 176 victims of the jetliner accidentally downed by Iran last week \u2013 57 of them Canadian \u2013 would still be alive if not for the recent escalation of tensions partly triggered by the US. Iran arrests. Tehran says arrests have been made over the shooting down of the Ukrainian airliner, which has led to days of protests and driven at least two hosts for the state broadcaster to quit. The crisis presents an opportunity for the US, writes Julian Borger, but it is unclear whether Trump will grasp it. US\u2019s deadly \u2018heat islands\u2019 linked to racist housing policy Extreme heat kills more people in the US each year than any other hazardous weather event. Now a landmark study has found urban heatwaves disproportionately affect low-income neighbourhoods, due in large part to the legacy of a long-banned racist housing policy. Temperatures in different parts of the same city can vary by up to 20F, researchers found \u2013 and the hottest neighbourhoods, or \u201cheat islands\u201d, are those which have historically had fewer green spaces and tree canopy, and more concrete and pavements. \u2018Redlining\u2019 legacy. The new study examined the link between those heat islands and the historic, racially motivated town-planning policy known as \u201credlining\u201d \u2013 which was banned in 1968, but whose demographic effects linger on. Queen gives reluctant blessing to Harry and Meghan\u2019s plans The Queen has reluctantly agreed to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u2019s plans to downgrade their royal status and split their time between the UK and Canada, following a crisis summit of senior royals at Sandringham on Monday. In a statement, the Queen stressed that although she would have preferred them to remain full-time royals, Harry and Meghan would remain \u201ca valued part of my family\u201d as they undergo a \u201cperiod of transition\u201d to the more \u201cprogressive\u201d roles they have requested. Canada\u2019s role. Trudeau has acknowledged there will be \u201cmany discussions to come\u201d on how Canada will deal with the couple\u2019s security, and whether taxpayers would have to foot the bill. Rethinking monarchy. Harry and Meghan should be allowed to escape the royal circus, says Suzanne Moore. It will give the rest of us a reason to rethink what monarchy means. Cheat sheet A Wisconsin judge has ruled that state election officials must purge 200,000 people from the voter rolls, to the dismay of voting rights activists, who said the ruling is designed to make it harder for students and minority populations to vote. More than 300 human rights activists were killed in 2019 while working to protect the environment, free speech, LGBTQ rights and indigenous lands, a report has found. The killings took place across 31 countries, but two-thirds of them occurred in Latin America alone. Scientists in the US have used stem cells from African clawed frogs to create the world\u2019s first living robots. The tiny creatures are \u201cliving, programmable organisms\u201d and \u201centirely new lifeforms,\u201d said one of their creators. The model Gigi Hadid has told a judge in Manhattan she can \u201ckeep an open mind on the facts\u201d as she was vetted to be a potential juror at Harvey Weinstein\u2019s rape trial \u2013 despite having met Weinstein and knowing some of his accusers.

Must-reads The awards season movies that aren\u2019t winning awards The Academy unveiled its 2020 Oscar nominees on Monday, with Joker leading a field notable for its continued dearth of diversity. But what of those Oscarbait movies that didn\u2019t make the grade? Benjamin Lee looks at the awards-ready films left out in the cold. How a fitness app became a religion The Strava app offers community, training data and motivation to millions of athletes, from park-runners to world champions. For an amateur, it\u2019s like having an elite coach in your phone, for free \u2013 and it\u2019s totally addictive, as Rose George discovered. Why are mothers leaving the tech industry? Half of women working in tech say they have experienced gender bias or discrimination. And the industry\u2019s long hours and bro culture can affect new mothers in particular, making them feel alienated at a time when they need support most, as Georgina Fuller reports. Life with dementia in Japan The numbers of people living with dementia in Japan are rising, and the stigma around the condition is at last beginning to fade. Justin McCurry and photographer Robin Hammond document the care facilities devising new solutions for an ageing society. Opinion Like Kamala Harris before him, Cory Booker has exited the Democratic presidential race after struggling to gain traction \u2013 specifically, says Derecka Purnell, with young voters of colour. Booker, and his diverse political peers including Juli\u00e1n Castro \u2013 who was the only Latinx candidate \u2013 Deval Patrick and Senator Harris, are caught between moving further left to capture young people of color, or further right to prove their potential as future establishment candidates. Sport LSU quarterback Joe Burrow has capped one of the greatest seasons in college football history by throwing five touchdown passes and running for a sixth score as he led his team to a 42-25 national championship victory against Clemson on Monday night. The Houston Astros have been fined $5m and deprived of their first- and second-round draft picks in 2020 and 2021 after an MLB investigation found the team cheated by stealing signs from opponents during their first ever World Series winning season in 2017.

A statement, issued through the princes\u2019 respective offices, said: \u201cDespite clear denials, a false story ran in a UK newspaper today speculating about the relationship between the Duke of Sussex and the Duke of Cambridge\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cFor brothers who care so deeply about the issues surrounding mental health, the use of such inflammatory language in this way is offensive and potentially harmful\u201d.</p> \n<p>Monday\u2019s Times cited a source claiming Harry and Meghan regarded themselves as having been pushed away by what they saw as a \u201cbullying\u201d attitude from William. It reported the source, said to be close to the couple, as saying William was insufficiently welcoming to Meghan when she first started dating Harry. The source claimed that William\u2019s attitude resulted from the competitive nature of his relationship with his younger brother.</p> \n<p>The last year has seen repeated reports of a suspected rift between the brothers.

          "bodyText": "The Queen has given her reluctant blessing to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex to split their time between the UK and Canada, making it clear that though she had wanted the couple to remain as full-time working royals, she supported their decision. After a historic summit of senior royals at Sandringham, details over exactly how Harry and Meghan will carve out the new \u201cprogressive\u201d roles they seek remained unclear. The Queen has, however, agreed to a \u201cperiod of transition\u201d and stressed the couple remain \u201ca valued part of my family\u201d. But there were \u201ccomplex matters\u201d still to resolve, and \u201cmore work to be done\u201d as she said she wants final decisions to be reached in the coming days. The Queen\u2019s statement came after 90 minutes of talks, which began against the backdrop of Prince William and Prince Harry attempting to stem rancorous speculation about their relationship in a joint statement. Shortly after the Sandringham summit ended, the Queen issued a personal and informal statement in which she also struck a conciliatory tone. \u201cToday my family had very constructive discussions on the future of my grandson and his family. \u201cMy family and I are entirely supportive of Harry and Meghan\u2019s desire to create a new life as a young family. Although we would have preferred them to remain full-time working members of the royal family, we respect and understand their wish to live a more independent life as a family while remaining a valued part of my family\u201d. \u201cHarry and Meghan have made clear that they do not want to be reliant on public funds in their new lives. \u201cIt has therefore been agreed that there will be a period of transition in which the Sussexes will spend time in Canada and the UK. \u201cThese are complex matters for my family to resolve, and there is some more work to be done, but I have asked for final decisions to be reached in the coming days\u201d. In a highly unusual move Harry and Meghan were not referred to as the duke and duchess in the statement, only as the Sussexes and by their first names, raising questions about whether they will retain their titles in the future. Monday\u2019s unprecedented summit was attended by the Queen, Charles, William and Harry, and was the first time the senior royals had met since the Sussexes made their shock statement last Wednesday. Meghan was due to join by conference call from Canada, where she has been since Friday, with the couple\u2019s son, Archie, and their two dogs. The couple want to \u201cstep back\u201d as senior royals, perform royal duties \u201cas called upon\u201d, continue their charitable work and, crucially, be allowed to earn a income. The palace had been blindsided by the timing of the couple\u2019s announcement, made without warning, which left family members feeling \u201cdisappointed\u201d and \u201churt\u201d according to sources. Ahead of Monday\u2019s meeting William and Harry broke their silence over the royal crisis to condemn speculation about their relationship as \u201coffensive and potentially harmful\u201d. In a show of unity, the brothers jointly attacked a UK newspaper report, thought to be in the Times, though senior aides did not specify. A statement, issued through the princes\u2019 respective offices, said: \u201cDespite clear denials, a false story ran in a UK newspaper today speculating about the relationship between the Duke of Sussex and the Duke of Cambridge\u201d. \u201cFor brothers who care so deeply about the issues surrounding mental health, the use of such inflammatory language in this way is offensive and potentially harmful\u201d. Monday\u2019s Times cited a source claiming Harry and Meghan regarded themselves as having been pushed away by what they saw as a \u201cbullying\u201d attitude from William. It reported the source, said to be close to the couple, as saying William was insufficiently welcoming to Meghan when she first started dating Harry. The source claimed that William\u2019s attitude resulted from the competitive nature of his relationship with his younger brother. The last year has seen repeated reports of a suspected rift between the brothers. Harry then appeared to confirm the speculation when he told an ITV documentary in October that the brothers, once so close, were on \u201cdifferent paths\u201d. It is unusual for palace aides to issue such vehement public denials on such personal matters. The fact they did so is indicative of just how sensitive feelings are within the family as they seek to reconcile differences and contain the crisis to prevent further damage to the monarchy. The palace is also desperate to avoid a repeat of any narrative such as the so-called \u201cWar of the Waleses\u201d, which accompanied the breakdown of Charles and Diana\u2019s marriage. Final decisions yet to be made on the Sussex\u2019s severance from full-time royal duties will have huge implications for the shape of the monarchy, and for the future roles of young royals including Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis, the youngest of the Cambridge\u2019s three children. No details were given of issues discussed, but they were likely to have included how much time the couple intend to spend in Canada, where their son will be raised, what royal duties they will still perform, and what commercial activities would it be feasible for them to undertake in order to become self-funding yet not risk tarnishing the royal brand. One possible blueprint regarding how the couple could approach commercial enterprises are guidelines devised almost 20 years ago after the Countess of Wessex was accused of cashing in on her royal status in a bid to win business for her PR firm from a \u201cfake sheikh\u201d undercover reporter. Those rules advise royals to first consult the Lord Chamberlain \u2013 the most senior official of the royal household \u2013 before taking on any new business activity. They also require that anyone connected with a business activity \u201cshould be carefully briefed not to try to exploit , either deliberately or inadvertently, the member of the royal family\u2019s position, associations or access.\u201d Both Edward, who worked in television, and Sophie, who worked in PR, stepped down from their jobs after aides accepted they worked in areas prone to accusations of exploitation. The move has raised questions over whether Canadian taxpayers would have to pay for the couple\u2019s security costs during their time in North America but the country\u2019s prime minister Justin Trudeau said no discussions had taken place. Speaking to Canadian broadcaster Global News on Monday, he said: \u201cThere will be many discussions to come on how that works. \u201cBut there\u2019s still a lot of decisions to be taken by the royal family and by the Sussexes themselves as to what level of engagement they choose to have and these are things that we are supportive of.\u201d Earlier, Penny Junor, a royal biographer, said the Queen\u2019s statement on Monday was \u201cfriendly and warm\u201d and gave the couple space to find some perspective. \u201cI think it will take the pressure off them. I think they\u2019re in a very vulnerable state at the moment. I think they\u2019re unhappy, they feel isolated and unloved, unappreciated and they needed careful handling,\u201d she said. \u201cMy reading from that statement is that the family has been sensitive to their vulnerability.\u201d",

          "body": "<h2>Top story: US stance contradicts MI5\u2019s advice</h2> \n<p>Good morning and welcome to this Tuesday briefing with Alison Rourke.</p> \n<p>A blunt briefing from Donald Trump\u2019s national security adviser has put Boris Johnson in a difficult position. Matt Pottinger has told British ministers that transatlantic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/13/using-huawei-in-uk-5g-networks-would-be-madness-us-says\">intelligence sharing would be at risk</a> if Huawei technology was used in the UK\u2019s 5G networks. The intense lobbying from Washington comes as Johnson is expected to make a final decision about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/13/why-the-controversy-over-huawei-technology-in-uk-networks\">controversial deal</a> within weeks. On the weekend, the head of MI5, Andrew Parker, said he saw <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/12/huawei-technology-poses-no-threat-to-uk-security-ex-mi5-head\">\u201cno reason to think\u201d</a> that using Huawei technology should threaten intelligence sharing with the US, suggesting that Britain was poised to give the Chinese company the go-ahead. Huawei denies it has ever been asked by Beijing to introduce secret \u201cback doors\u201d into its technology, and has offered to sign a \u201cno spy agreement\u201d with countries adopting it. The US delegation claimed that Chinese spies, working for the People\u2019s Liberation Army, also worked simultaneously for Huawei. The Chinese telco is one of three companies that supply equipment to Vodafone, BT and other mobile phone companies for high-speed 5G networks, alongside Ericsson of Sweden and Nokia from Finland.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>\u2018Bigger strategy\u2019</strong> \u2013 The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, says targeting Iran\u2019s top general, Qassem Suleimani, was<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/14/pompeo-says-killing-of-suleimani-is-part-of-bigger-strategy-to-deter-us-foes\"> part of a bigger strategy</a> of deterring challenges by US foes that also applies to China and Russia. His assertions sit uncomfortably with earlier insistence from the Trump administration that killing the Iranian general was about preventing an imminent attack on American assets. Yesterday the US defence secretary, Mark Esper, said he had seen no intelligence forewarning of imminent attacks on embassies. But Trump said \u201cit really doesn\u2019t matter\u201d whether Suleimani posed an imminent threat. Pompeo described Washington\u2019s strategy as \u201cre-establishing deterrence, real deterrence, against the Islamic Republic of Iran\u201d. In Iran itself, at least two journalists at the state broadcaster have quit, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/13/journalists-quit-iranian-state-broadcaster-over-crash-cover-up\">citing a cover-up over the downing of the Ukrainian passenger plane.</a> Protests against the regime have continued in Tehran with authorities using <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/13/iran-protests-witnesses-live-ammunition-fired-disperse-crowds-tehran\">live ammunition to disperse demonstrators.</a></p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>\u2018Complex matters\u2019</strong> \u2013 Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has said no discussions have taken place about whether Canadians will foot the bill for Harry and Meghan\u2019s time in the country, after the Queen signed off on the couple\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/13/queen-gives-reluctant-blessing-to-harry-and-meghans-plans\">desire to split their time between there and the UK</a>. \u201cI think most Canadians are very supportive of having royals be here, but how that looks and what kind of costs are involved, there are still lots of discussions to have,\u201d Trudeau said in an interview with the Canadian broadcaster, Global News. \u201cBut there\u2019s still a lot of decisions to be taken by the royal family and by the Sussexes themselves as to what level of engagement they choose to have and these are things that we are supportive of.\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Diagnosis delay</strong> \u2013 Nearly half of parents whose children are referred for assessment for autism face an 18-month wait for a formal diagnosis.

          "bodyText": "Top story: US stance contradicts MI5\u2019s advice Good morning and welcome to this Tuesday briefing with Alison Rourke. A blunt briefing from Donald Trump\u2019s national security adviser has put Boris Johnson in a difficult position. Matt Pottinger has told British ministers that transatlantic intelligence sharing would be at risk if Huawei technology was used in the UK\u2019s 5G networks. The intense lobbying from Washington comes as Johnson is expected to make a final decision about the controversial deal within weeks. On the weekend, the head of MI5, Andrew Parker, said he saw \u201cno reason to think\u201d that using Huawei technology should threaten intelligence sharing with the US, suggesting that Britain was poised to give the Chinese company the go-ahead. Huawei denies it has ever been asked by Beijing to introduce secret \u201cback doors\u201d into its technology, and has offered to sign a \u201cno spy agreement\u201d with countries adopting it. The US delegation claimed that Chinese spies, working for the People\u2019s Liberation Army, also worked simultaneously for Huawei. The Chinese telco is one of three companies that supply equipment to Vodafone, BT and other mobile phone companies for high-speed 5G networks, alongside Ericsson of Sweden and Nokia from Finland. * * * \u2018Bigger strategy\u2019 \u2013 The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, says targeting Iran\u2019s top general, Qassem Suleimani, was part of a bigger strategy of deterring challenges by US foes that also applies to China and Russia. His assertions sit uncomfortably with earlier insistence from the Trump administration that killing the Iranian general was about preventing an imminent attack on American assets. Yesterday the US defence secretary, Mark Esper, said he had seen no intelligence forewarning of imminent attacks on embassies. But Trump said \u201cit really doesn\u2019t matter\u201d whether Suleimani posed an imminent threat. Pompeo described Washington\u2019s strategy as \u201cre-establishing deterrence, real deterrence, against the Islamic Republic of Iran\u201d. In Iran itself, at least two journalists at the state broadcaster have quit, citing a cover-up over the downing of the Ukrainian passenger plane. Protests against the regime have continued in Tehran with authorities using live ammunition to disperse demonstrators. * * * \u2018Complex matters\u2019 \u2013 Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has said no discussions have taken place about whether Canadians will foot the bill for Harry and Meghan\u2019s time in the country, after the Queen signed off on the couple\u2019s desire to split their time between there and the UK. \u201cI think most Canadians are very supportive of having royals be here, but how that looks and what kind of costs are involved, there are still lots of discussions to have,\u201d Trudeau said in an interview with the Canadian broadcaster, Global News. \u201cBut there\u2019s still a lot of decisions to be taken by the royal family and by the Sussexes themselves as to what level of engagement they choose to have and these are things that we are supportive of.\u201d * * * Diagnosis delay \u2013 Nearly half of parents whose children are referred for assessment for autism face an 18-month wait for a formal diagnosis. In some cases, families wait three years, according to the charity Ambitious about Autism. \u201cMany parents say they feel isolated and helpless as they wait to find out if their child has autism,\u201d said Jolanta Lasota, the chief executive. The charity says about one in 100 children in the UK have autism, with boys diagnosed four times as often as girls. About 70% of the 4,000 parents surveyed said they were not offered adequate support after their child\u2019s diagnosis. * * * Democratic spat \u2013 Elizabeth Warren has said Bernie Sanders, one of her main 2020 rivals, told her in a private meeting that he didn\u2019t think a woman could beat Donald Trump to become president. \u201cI thought a woman could win; he disagreed,\u201d she said in a statement last night, adding: \u201cI have no interest in discussing this private meeting any further because Bernie and I have far more in common than our differences on punditry.\u201d Sanders vehemently denied the comments, in a back and forth that represents a dramatic break from the party\u2019s leading progressives after a months-long truce. * * * Eat, don\u2019t snap \u2013 The celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal has criticised diners for being more interested in photographing their food than eating it. The triple Michelin-starred Fat Duck proprietor said he had to resist the temptation to intervene because he doesn\u2019t want to upset his customers. \u201cAt the Fat Duck, we\u2019ve debated this for several years now. If we say to people, \u2018Your food\u2019s going cold\u2019, you put up a barrier between you and the diner,\u201d Blumenthal told the Radio Times. \u201cWe did it once in Australia because somebody was taking pictures with a flash, which affected other tables. It\u2019s a really tricky thing.\u201d Today in Focus podcast: Why did Carlos Ghosn choose a life on the run? The former CEO of Nissan, Carlos Ghosn, was once one of Japan\u2019s most respected business people. Now, as the Guardian\u2019s Justin McCurry reports, he\u2019s on the run in Lebanon after fleeing the country to escape corruption charges.

Many considered Suleimani to have been the second most powerful person in Iran, behind supreme leader of Iran Ali Khamenei, but arguably ahead of President Hassan Rouhani. He was commander of the Quds Force, the elite, external wing of the Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which the Trump administration designated as a terror organisation in April last year.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>He was born in Rabor, a city in eastern Iran, and forced to travel to a neighbouring city at age 13 and work to pay his father\u2019s debts to the government of the Shah. By the time the monarch fell in 1979, Suleimani was committed to the clerical rule of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and joined the Revolutionary Guards, the paramilitary force established to prevent a coup against the newly declared Islamic Republic.</p>\n    <p>Within two years, he was sent to the front to fight in the war against the invading Iraqi army. He quickly distinguished himself, especially for daring reconnaissance missions behind Iraqi lines, and the war also gave him his first contact with foreign militias of the kind he would wield to devastating effect in the decades to come.</p>\n    <p>By the the time the Iraq government fell in 2003, Suleimani was the head of the Quds force and blamed for sponsoring the Shia militias who killed thousands of civilian Iraqis and coalition troops. As fighting raged on Iraq\u2019s streets, Suleimani fought a shadow war with the US for leverage over the new Iraqi leadership.</p>\n    <p>Once described by American commander David Petraeus as \u2018a truly evil figure\u2019, Suleimani was instrumental in crushing street protests in Iran in 2009. In recent months outbreaks of popular dissent in Lebanon, Iraq and Iran were again putting pressure on the crescent of influence he had spent the past two decades building. Violent crackdowns on the protests in Baghdad were blamed on militias under his influence.<br></p>\n    <p>Eighteen months before his death, Suleimani had issued Donald Trump a public warning, wagging his finger and dressed in olive fatigues. \u201cYou will start the war but we will end it.\u201d</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/michael-safi\"><b>Michael Safi</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>He cited the resumption of lethal military aid to Ukraine for defence against Russia-backed separatists, Trump\u2019s withdrawal from an arms control accord with Moscow and tests of a new US intermediate-range cruise missile.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/13/crisis-iran-opportunity-for-washington-donald-trump\">Crisis for Iran may present an opportunity for Washington</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Pompeo also pointed to increased US naval exercises in the South China Sea in response to China\u2019s militarisation of disputed islands and Trump\u2019s imposition of tariffs on Chinese imports as aspects of the administration\u2019s deterrence strategy. \u201cWe\u2019re restoring credibility to deterrence,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>His comments came as the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said victims of an Iran-downed jetliner would still be alive if not for a recent escalation of tensions partly triggered by the US.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think if there were no tensions, if there was no escalation recently in the region, those Canadians would be right now home with their families,\u201d Trudeau said in an interview with Global television, according to a transcript.

The Times said Sedwill had been dragged into the row last week and that he and the prime minister would ultimately have to decide on the allocation of any public money to the couple in the future.</p> <h2>Sir Edward Young</h2> <p>The Queen\u2019s top aide, who has reportedly come under increasing pressure since Harry and Meghan\u2019s announcement.

Alderton returned to work for Prince Charles after a spell as Britain\u2019s ambassador to Morocco. He had previously served as an aide in Charles\u2019 official London residence, Clarence House, and is reported to be popular with the prince\u2019s family.</p> <h2>Simon Case</h2> <p>The Duke of Cambridge\u2019s private secretary is a civil servant who formerly worked on solving the Irish border issue during Brexit discussions. He also served as principal private secretary to David Cameron when he was prime minister, having previously worked as GCHQ\u2019s director of strategy.</p> <h2>Fiona Mcilwham</h2> <p>The Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u2019s private secretary is relatively new to the role.

It will be his first public engagement since news of his intention to step back from royal duties broke.

Here are some of the main topics that you imagine would be part of the discussions today:</p> <p><strong>Titles</strong></p> <p>If the couple seem determined to step back from royal duties, then the royal family may want to step back from honouring them with titles. It is unclear whether the British public would regard removing the titles as petty, or as the right thing to do if the couple are no longer working as part of the royal family. However, the question of titles might not be as pressing as it first appears. Regardless of whether he retains a formal royal title or not, Harry will remain the youngest son of Diana, Princess of Wales. That in itself will guarantee enduring public interest in his life for years to come. <br></p> <p><strong>Living arrangements</strong><br></p> <p>The couple have suggested they will split their time between North America and the UK. However, if Meghan wants to apply for British citizenship she is required to only spend 90 days outside the country. <br></p> <p>There\u2019s also the question of whether they can retain Frogmore Cottage, the Grade II-listed house in Windsor they currently use as a base. It was refurbished recently with \u00a32.4m of taxpayer money. It is owned by the Queen.<br></p> <p><strong>Security</strong><br></p> <p>Living abroad some of the year poses a unique set of security challenges for the royal family to face. The Sussexes would still require 24/7 security protection \u2013 but who is going to pay for it? There are reports today that the Canadian PM, Justin Trudeau, has suggested his country may be prepared to contribute \u2013 although that may not please the Canadian public.<br></p> <p><strong>Funding</strong><br></p> <p>The couple aren\u2019t short of money, either from Meghan\u2019s earnings before she married into the royal family, or from the money that Prince Harry inherited from his mother. But whatever they do to try and bring in an income is liable to be controversial, and open to accusations that they are trading on the royal family\u2019s name. They appear to be willing to give up direct state funding from the sovereign grant which is estimated to make up about 5% of their annual costs. The rest of the money is currently met with revenues from the Duchy of Cornwall granted to them by Harry\u2019s father, Charles.</p> <p><strong>Taxation</strong></p> <p>If the couple split their time between the UK and Canada they may have to split their tax affairs. Both Canadian and UK authorities would stake a claim on revenue earned within their jurisdiction. <br></p> <p><strong>Future royal duties and charity work</strong><br></p> <p>The couple\u2019s statement that they wanted to step back from being \u201csenior royals\u201d didn\u2019t appear to totally rule out doing some official engagements. One of the topics to be explored at the summit today will no doubt be the extent to which it is practical for them to combine official royal duties with an independent lifestyle, and their own soon-to-be-launched charitable foundation.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-13T16:04:10.934Z\">at 4.04pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e1c8b318f08d66fcfaa3205\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-13T15:23:25.556Z\">3.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A reminder that the main development of the day so far, as we wait for news to emerge from the Sandringham summit, is that the Duke of Sussex and Duke of Cambridge have issued a furious denial over a newspaper report speculating on causes of a rift between them, branding it \u201coffensive and potentially harmful\u201d.</p> <p>You can read my colleague Caroline Davies\u2019s full report on it here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/13/william-and-harry-rubbish-offensive-and-potentially-harmful-story\">William and Harry rubbish 'offensive and potentially harmful' story</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e1c84708f0852212f74d2f7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-13T15:03:35.124Z\">3.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Press Association have just put out a report outlining the existing rules by which members of the royal family are allowed to carry out commercial activities. They could form the starting point for any agreement that comes out of today\u2019s summit meeting. They were devised almost 20 years ago, in the wake of a scandal when the Countess of Wessex was accused of cashing in on her royal status in an attempt to win business for her PR firm.</p> <p>Under the rules, royals have to first consult the Lord Chamberlain before taking on a new business activity. They could be seen as an impediment to the kind of independence that Harry and Meghan appear to be seeking. </p> <p>The guidelines also stressed that anyone connected with a business activity \u201cshould be carefully briefed not to try to exploit, either deliberately or inadvertently, the member of the royal family\u2019s position, associations or access\u201d.</p> <p>At the time the rules were introduced there were also calls for a register of royal interests, similar to that operated by MPs, listing the business interests or shareholdings of members of the royal family. This was not introduced, with palace officials warning it could be exploited as an unofficial endorsement.</p> <p>It does throw into sharp relief one of the contradictions at the heart of the Sussexes\u2019 bid for commercial freedom.

With funds from the successful cookbook, they have now been able to share their spirit of community with so many more. The Hubb continues to work with local organisations to build hope, bring comfort and provide not simply a warm meal, but with it, a sense of togetherness. The Duke and Duchess were so happy to reconnect with the women and hear about the projects they continue to develop to help those in their community and beyond.

          "bodyText": "Here are the main points so far today: The Queen has agreed to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u2019s wish to take a step back from public life, though she said she stressed that her preference would have been for the couple to remain as full-time working royals. The monarch, Prince Charles, Prince William and Prince Harry met at Sandringham to discuss the plans today. Prince William and Prince Harry have issued a joint statement dismissing a \u201cfalse story\u201d in a UK newspaper about their relationship. The two princes said: \u201cFor brothers who care so deeply about the issues surrounding mental health, the use of inflammatory language in this way is offensive and potentially harmful.\u201d Although they did not name the paper, it is believed to be a reference to an article in the Times which suggested the Sussexes had been driven away from the royal family by bullying behaviour. The home secretary, Priti Patel, contradicted Prince Harry\u2019s claims that negative coverage of his wife has been motivated by an undercurrent of racism. She said: \u201cI\u2019m not in that category at all where I believe there\u2019s racism at all. I think we live in a great country, a great society, full of opportunity, where people of any background can get on in life.\u201d The chief executive of the Rugby Football League, Ralph Rimmer, says he is very hopeful that Prince Harry will remain its patron. Harry will conduct the draw for the 2021 Rugby League World Cup at Buckingham Palace on Thursday in his first public engagement since he and Meghan issued their statement last week. My colleague, Caroline Davies, has tonight\u2019s main story: Community workers and charity organisers have defended the Duke and Duchess of Sussex after they were accused of letting the country and their family down by seeking to step back from their senior royal status. After days of criticism of Harry and Meghan, the Queen said on Monday that while she would have preferred them to remain full-time royals she was \u201centirely supportive\u201d of the plan. Her defence came after some members of the military had hit out at Harry in particular over the weekend, accusing him of \u201cdisrespect to the Queen\u201d and his former comrades. One said his fellow marines were \u201cvery upset, if not disgusted\u201d with the decision. On Monday, however, some of those who have worked alongside the Sussexes on grassroots and research initiatives in Nottingham gave them their strong support and said they had been impressed by the extent of their commitment to their work. My colleague Simon Jenkins has written an interesting opinion piece, in which he suggests the monarchy is incapable of the sort of change for which Harry and Meghan hoped. No, the monarchy is not in crisis. No, the princes are not bullies. No, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will not be destitute, merely stinking rich. No, they will not go unprotected. In a nutshell, the past few days\u2019 events, inconceivable in any other democracy, really do not matter. Pull the other one. The nation is on tenterhooks, or at least its mass media is. The royal press corps is about to be deprived of its beloved stereotype; the tearaway young prince who goes to war, marries a beautiful woman and \u201cshakes the monarchy to its foundations\u201d. But stereotypes always fade. The British monarchy has handled worse than this. Only senior royals were due to attend today\u2019s meeting, but the talks have been shaped and directed behind the scenes by a group of senior aides who have provided briefings on the implications of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u2019s decision to step back from some of the duties and pressures of public life. Sir Mark Sedwill The palace reportedly consulted the cabinet secretary on the constitutional implications. The Times said Sedwill had been dragged into the row last week and that he and the prime minister would ultimately have to decide on the allocation of any public money to the couple in the future. Sir Edward Young The Queen\u2019s top aide, who has reportedly come under increasing pressure since Harry and Meghan\u2019s announcement. According to the Sunday Times, Princess Anne and Prince Edward are among the members of a faction who want to see him ousted, believing him to have failed to stop the situation reaching crisis point. Clive Alderton The principal private secretary to the Prince of Wales and a career diplomat. Alderton returned to work for Prince Charles after a spell as Britain\u2019s ambassador to Morocco. He had previously served as an aide in Charles\u2019 official London residence, Clarence House, and is reported to be popular with the prince\u2019s family. Simon Case The Duke of Cambridge\u2019s private secretary is a civil servant who formerly worked on solving the Irish border issue during Brexit discussions. He also served as principal private secretary to David Cameron when he was prime minister, having previously worked as GCHQ\u2019s director of strategy. Fiona Mcilwham The Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u2019s private secretary is relatively new to the role. She is a top diplomat and became one of the UK\u2019s youngest ambassadors when she was posted to Albania aged 35 in 2009. She impressed in the role, with the Albanian journalist Muhamed Veliu telling the Mail on Sunday she \u201cquickly gained huge respect\u201d at a time of mounting political tension over organised crime. After a mountain of speculation since Harry and Meghan declared their intentions last week, today\u2019s statement from the Queen leaves us a little clearer about what the future will hold for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, even if it is necessarily light on detail. The Queen said there were complex issues to address and that more work needed to be done,but she also set a timetable, saying she expects final decisions to be reached in days. The statement announces a \u201cperiod of transition\u201d for the royal couple and their young son Archie as they spend time in Canada and the UK, while they reduce their reliance on public funds. The Queen\u2019s statement about the Sandringham talks followed an earlier joint statement issued by Prince William and Prince Harry, which described as false a UK newspaper story claiming the Sussexes felt they were being forced out by \u201cbullying\u201d behaviour within the family. Given that both brothers have spoken in recent months about the previously close nature of their relationship changing, it will be seen as a sign of unity on a significant day for the future shape of the British monarchy. Buckingham Palace has just released the following statement from the Queen: Today my family had very constructive discussions on the future of my grandson and his family. My family and I are entirely supportive of Harry and Meghan\u2019s desire to create a new life as a young family. Although we would have preferred them to remain full-time working Members of the Royal Family, we respect and understand their wish to live a more independent life as a family while remaining a valued part of my family. Harry and Meghan have made clear that they do not want to be reliant on public funds in their new lives. It has therefore been agreed that there will be a period of transition in which the Sussexes will spend time in Canada and the UK. These are complex matters for my family to resolve, and there is some more work to be done, but I have asked for final decisions to be reached in the coming days. Reports are coming in from correspondents at Sandringham that the royals have left the estate. Prince Charles, Prince William &amp; Prince Harry are all believed to have left Sandringham House separately, at around 4:30pm. Buckingham Palace has said a statement following today\u2019s meeting will follow shortly. Here are the main points so far today: The Queen, Prince Charles, Prince William and Prince Harry are meeting at Sandringham to discuss the future of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex as they attempt to step away from senior royal duties and forge a more independent life. Prince William and Prince Harry have issued a joint statement dismissing a \u201cfalse story\u201d in a UK newspaper speculating about their relationship. The two princes say: \u201cFor brothers who care so deeply about the issues surrounding mental health, the use of inflammatory language in this way is offensive and potentially harmful.\u201d Although they did not name the paper, it is believed to be a reference to an article in the Times which suggested the Sussexes had been driven away from the royal family by \u201cbullying\u201d behaviour. The home secretary, Priti Patel, contradicted Prince Harry\u2019s claims that negative coverage of his wife has been motivated by an undercurrent of racism. She said: \u201cI\u2019m not in that category at all where I believe there\u2019s racism at all. I think we live in a great country, a great society, full of opportunity, where people of any background can get on in life.\u201d The chief executive of the Rugby Football League, Ralph Rimmer, says he is very hopeful that Prince Harry will remain its patron. Harry will be conducting the draw for the 2021 Rugby League World Cup at Buckingham Palace on Thursday in his first public engagement since he and Meghan issued their statement last week. It\u2019s got to be said that the media hanging out at Sandringham today have had very little to report directly on. One moment of excitement did happen about an hour ago though, when a man got on top of a car with a megaphone and began addressing the media and the police present at the Queen\u2019s private estate. ITV News\u2019s royal editor, Chris Ship, posted this clip a little while ago, during which the protester appears to describe the media as a \u201csavage bunch of dogs\u201d. Away from Sandringham, my colleague Aaron Bower from the sport desk has been attending a press event in Huddersfield with Ralph Rimmer, the chief executive of the Rugby Football League. Prince Harry, in his role as patron for the sport of rugby league, will conduct the draw for the 2021 Rugby League World Cup at Buckingham Palace on Thursday. It will be his first public engagement since news of his intention to step back from royal duties broke. Rimmer was asked about Harry\u2019s duties, and expects him to continue. \u201cI\u2019m very hopeful [he will continue],\u201d Rimmer said. \u201cFrom what I know, I think his patronages will remain, but that could change. We haven\u2019t had anything negative from the palace or his office regarding our patronage, but there are plenty of wheels turning in the machine at this moment in time. As far as I understand from the news, there will be some clarifications ironed out today, so we\u2019ll see how his patronages work out after that.\u201d On Harry\u2019s involvement with Thursday\u2019s World Cup draw, Rimmer said: \u201cIn light of everything that has happened recently, we\u2019re honoured that he will make the draw. He\u2019s been a superb patron for us. Of course there will be the eyes and ears of the world\u2019s media on that event and I suppose the event will benefit from that.\u201d Some outlets have run pictures of what appears to have been a car carrying Harry into Sandringham at around 1.45pm, before the summit which was believed to be starting at 2pm. Here are some of the main topics that you imagine would be part of the discussions today: Titles If the couple seem determined to step back from royal duties, then the royal family may want to step back from honouring them with titles. It is unclear whether the British public would regard removing the titles as petty, or as the right thing to do if the couple are no longer working as part of the royal family. However, the question of titles might not be as pressing as it first appears. Regardless of whether he retains a formal royal title or not, Harry will remain the youngest son of Diana, Princess of Wales. That in itself will guarantee enduring public interest in his life for years to come. Living arrangements The couple have suggested they will split their time between North America and the UK. However, if Meghan wants to apply for British citizenship she is required to only spend 90 days outside the country. There\u2019s also the question of whether they can retain Frogmore Cottage, the Grade II-listed house in Windsor they currently use as a base. It was refurbished recently with \u00a32.4m of taxpayer money. It is owned by the Queen. Security Living abroad some of the year poses a unique set of security challenges for the royal family to face. The Sussexes would still require 24/7 security protection \u2013 but who is going to pay for it? There are reports today that the Canadian PM, Justin Trudeau, has suggested his country may be prepared to contribute \u2013 although that may not please the Canadian public. Funding The couple aren\u2019t short of money, either from Meghan\u2019s earnings before she married into the royal family, or from the money that Prince Harry inherited from his mother. But whatever they do to try and bring in an income is liable to be controversial, and open to accusations that they are trading on the royal family\u2019s name. They appear to be willing to give up direct state funding from the sovereign grant which is estimated to make up about 5% of their annual costs. The rest of the money is currently met with revenues from the Duchy of Cornwall granted to them by Harry\u2019s father, Charles. Taxation If the couple split their time between the UK and Canada they may have to split their tax affairs. Both Canadian and UK authorities would stake a claim on revenue earned within their jurisdiction. Future royal duties and charity work The couple\u2019s statement that they wanted to step back from being \u201csenior royals\u201d didn\u2019t appear to totally rule out doing some official engagements. One of the topics to be explored at the summit today will no doubt be the extent to which it is practical for them to combine official royal duties with an independent lifestyle, and their own soon-to-be-launched charitable foundation. A reminder that the main development of the day so far, as we wait for news to emerge from the Sandringham summit, is that the Duke of Sussex and Duke of Cambridge have issued a furious denial over a newspaper report speculating on causes of a rift between them, branding it \u201coffensive and potentially harmful\u201d. You can read my colleague Caroline Davies\u2019s full report on it here: The Press Association have just put out a report outlining the existing rules by which members of the royal family are allowed to carry out commercial activities. They could form the starting point for any agreement that comes out of today\u2019s summit meeting. They were devised almost 20 years ago, in the wake of a scandal when the Countess of Wessex was accused of cashing in on her royal status in an attempt to win business for her PR firm. Under the rules, royals have to first consult the Lord Chamberlain before taking on a new business activity. They could be seen as an impediment to the kind of independence that Harry and Meghan appear to be seeking. The guidelines also stressed that anyone connected with a business activity \u201cshould be carefully briefed not to try to exploit, either deliberately or inadvertently, the member of the royal family\u2019s position, associations or access\u201d. At the time the rules were introduced there were also calls for a register of royal interests, similar to that operated by MPs, listing the business interests or shareholdings of members of the royal family. This was not introduced, with palace officials warning it could be exploited as an unofficial endorsement. It does throw into sharp relief one of the contradictions at the heart of the Sussexes\u2019 bid for commercial freedom. Their worth in terms of endorsements and commercial exploitation rest, at least on Prince Harry\u2019s side, almost entirely on being a member of the royal family. It is difficult to see how any work by the proposed \u201cSussex Royal\u201d brand (see 10:50) can be anything other than tied up with their connections to the monarchy. Harry, though, might point to the example of his mother. Diana continued to do charity work and maintain a high media profile even after she had in effect been ostracised from the heart of the royal family. The treatment of the Duchess of Sussex by the media, and what her brand of appealing to the socially progressive younger generation symbolises for Britain\u2019s culture warriors such as Piers Morgan and Eamonn Holmes, is the subject of Owen Jones\u2019s column today: Britain\u2019s culture war can be summed up like this: a currently triumphalist faction that believes that progressive social norms have gone too far and that so-called \u201cidentity politics\u201d, PC culture and the \u201cwoke\u201d need to be driven back. Meghan became a target because she is a mixed-race American with no aristocratic blood, who dared to import vaguely progressive values into the most conservative of British institutions. Even worse, she supposedly seduced a linchpin of the monarchy to these nefarious \u201cwoke\u201d ways. It is being reported in London\u2019s Evening Standard that the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has privately assured the Queen that the commonwealth country would pick up the bill for security for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex if they were to move to Canada as has been mooted. That could prove contentious domestically for Trudeau. Dr Barry Mackenzie, a Canadian royal historian, was asked about exactly this on BBC Radio 5 live this morning, and said: \u201cThat I think is going to be a sticking point for Canadians. And even though this whole scenario seems to have done a lot to make Canadians sympathetic to the situation in which the Queen finds herself, at the same, if this arrangement means that Canadians are going to have to pick up that bill, then I do fear that may be fodder for republicans, who already complain about the fact that the monarchy is expensive.\u201d We heard similar views when we asked our Canadian readers what they thought about the proposed move. The Queen, Prince Charles, Prince William and Prince Harry are due to met at Sandringham for an emergency summit to discuss the announcement by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex that they intend to step back from being senior royal figures and become self-financing. The home secretary, Priti Patel, has contradicted Prince Harry\u2019s claims that negative coverage of his wife has been motivated by an undercurrent of racism. She said: \u201cI\u2019m not in that category at all where I believe there\u2019s racism at all. I think we live in a great country, a great society, full of opportunity, where people of any background can get on in life. I certainly haven\u2019t seen that through any debates or commentary or things of that nature.\u201d Prince William and Prince Harry have issued a joint statement dismissing a \u201cfalse story\u201d in a UK newspaper today speculating about their relationship. The two princes say: \u201cDespite clear denials, a false story ran in a UK newspaper today speculating about the relationship between the Duke of Sussex and the Duke of Cambridge. For brothers who care so deeply about the issues surrounding mental health, the use of inflammatory language in this way is offensive and potentially harmful.\u201d Although they did not name the paper, it is believed to be a reference to an article in the Times which suggested the Sussexes had been driven away from the royal family by \u201cbullying\u201d behaviour. With the abrupt announcement that they were intending to step back from royal duties, it has been natural to look back at some of the things that Prince Harry has previously said about his role in the royal family through a slightly different lens. As recently as 2017 he spoke to Newsweek magazine about considering leaving the royal family: \u201cI felt I wanted out but then decided to stay in and work out a role for myself.\u201d Today\u2019s summit meeting at Sandringham is not just a family gathering though; it is a business meeting. Interviewed around the time of the Queen\u2019s 90th birthday, Harry told the BBC: \u201cI still view her more as the Queen than my grandmother. You have this huge amount of respect for your boss and I always view her as my boss \u2013 but occasionally as a grandmother.\u201d And maybe there\u2019s a hint of what comes next in what he\u2019s said before. Harry once answered a question on what he would do if he were not a prince: \u201cI\u2019d probably live in Africa. I\u2019d like to spend all my time out there \u2026 As a job, it would probably be a safari guide.\u201d It has been believed for some time that Prince Charles is in favour of a slimmed-down version of the monarchy, which might be more likely to continue to carry public support. He may not have envisaged the changes happening so quickly, or being instigated by his youngest son. At the weekend Kate Williams argued in the Observer that Harry and Meghan\u2019s \u201cflexi-royal\u201d plan could help modernise the monarchy, bringing it more in line with the royal families of Europe, in which most members not in direct line have full-time careers. A few months ago, Prince Andrew revealed royal privilege and entitlement at its worst, refusing to apologise in his Newsnight interview for socialising with a sex criminal. And although he was criticised and forced to step down, it was a long time coming and it still seemed as if some in our society were angrier about Meghan wearing dark nail varnish than Andrew\u2019s links with Epstein. Harry and Meghan\u2019s decision to step back has gained huge traction and sympathy across the world. The royal family needs to work with their wishes or risk losing them for ever. Prince Harry and Prince William have dismissed a \u201cfalse story\u201d in a UK newspaper today speculating about their relationship. The joint statement on behalf of the Duke of Sussex and Duke of Cambridge said: \u201cDespite clear denials, a false story ran in a UK newspaper today speculating about the relationship between the Duke of Sussex and the Duke of Cambridge. For brothers who care so deeply about the issues surrounding mental health, the use of inflammatory language in this way is offensive and potentially harmful.\u201d The statement does not specify which report, but they are believed to be referring to a story in the Times which was headlined \u201cPrinces \u2018fell out because William wasn\u2019t friendly towards Meghan\u2019\u201d. The opening paragraph of that story referred to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex regarding themselves as \u201chaving been pushed away from the royal family by the \u2018bullying\u2019 attitude\u201d of the Duke of Cambridge. The Times claimed that a source, said to be close to the couple, had said William was insufficiently welcoming towards Meghan when she first started dating Harry as a result of the competitive nature of William\u2019s relationship with his younger brother. The report quoted the source as saying she had spent two years \u201cconstantly being told your place, constantly bullied as they would see it\u201d. The move comes a day after the Sunday Times reported William saying: \u201cI\u2019ve put my arm around my brother all our lives and I can\u2019t do that any more; we\u2019re separate entities.\u201d And in a documentary, filmed during the Sussexes\u2019 tour of southern Africa last autumn, Harry said he and William were now \u201con different paths\u201d and had \u201cgood days\u201d and \u201cbad days\u201d in their relationship. With the home secretary, Priti Patel, coming out today to say she had seen no racism in the coverage of Meghan Markle during her journey from becoming Prince Harry\u2019s partner to marrying into the royal family (see 10:14), it might be worth spending two minutes reading Nesrine Malik\u2019s blistering column from the Observer yesterday, where she spoke of \u201cBritain\u2019s racism pantomime\u201d. In many ways, any improvement in race relations has come with a proportional decline in self-awareness, and with it a degradation of the public conversation on race. The increased visibility of black and brown people in those spaces where this conversation takes place \u2013 in politics and the media \u2013 has achieved little apart from sifting them into for and against camps. Whenever a public figure is subjected to racist behaviour, a sort of kangaroo court is set up, one with an impossibly high bar for proving a racist event has occurred \u2013 anything short of an explicit slur or a violent attack can easily be explained away. The outcome of the litigation is certain because the whole point of the exercise is the spectacle, rather than the inquiry. There\u2019s an argument that the royal family haven\u2019t helped themselves in terms of media management in the way that they have made today\u2019s crisis summit a type of public event, but also private event. Having been informed that it is taking place, the media have of course set up camp outside Sandringham, hoping for photos of the members of the family as they arrive. But there\u2019s no scheduled press conference afterwards, and no formal public element to the proceedings. By the end of the day we may still be very much in a \u201cno white smoke yet\u201d situation. The Sun and the Mirror both focus their front pages on what comes next, and what they fear might be a worst-case scenario for the monarchy \u2013 that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex offer a \u201ctell-all\u201d TV interview to put their side of the story. The Sun\u2019s editorial is firm on what it thinks its readers expect: \u201cWhat\u2019s clear is that the couple must not receive a penny from the state. British taxpayers fund the royal family to strengthen our nation\u2019s soft power and to support vital charities. If Meghan and Harry can\u2019t be bothered with the legwork, then it goes without saying they must give up the whopping perks which come with it.\u201d The Sun also finds time to report that the Duchess of Sussex has only ever spent six hours in Sussex, an almost textbook example of the kind of negative coverage that has continually riled Prince Harry. The potential impact of a dynamite television interview is one that Prince Harry will be well aware of. His mother Princess Diana gave a landmark interview to Martin Bashir about the failure of her marriage to Prince Charles in 1995, when Harry was a child. As you can imagine, coverage of the crisis dominated most front pages in the UK this morning, with the Mirror, Mail, Sun, Telegraph and Times all leading with royal stories. Describing it on their masthead as \u201cD-day for the royals\u201d, the Telegraph\u2019s editorial says: \u201cThere is evidently a general willingness to recognise that Prince Harry and his wife do not want to continue with the role that had been expected of them, although many will deeply resent the suggestions that the Duchess has somehow been forced to flee by intrinsic racism and bigotry. Rarely has a royal marriage been so welcomed, largely because of the popularity of Prince Harry and a national desire to see him happy.\u201d The paper\u2019s deferential sympathies, though, very much lie with the plight of the Queen. Their editorial goes on to say: \u201cIt is also clear that the country does not want to see a \u2018half-in, half-out\u2019 arrangement reached, which would not be fair on the other senior royals. In particular, it would not be fair on the Queen, who has again been confronted with an unnecessarily onerous task, which she approaches with her usual dutiful fortitude, but at a time in her life when she deserves better.\u201d A key aspect for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex to establish will be where their future commercial interests lie. They have already made moves to trademark their names. My colleague Ben Quinn reports that back in December they filed an application with the World Intellectual Property Organization in the name of their new foundation \u201cSussex Royal\u201d. The application covered Australia, Canada, the EU and US, and was for a range of items and activities including clothing, stationery and the running of \u201cemotional support groups\u201d. The couple already use \u201cSussex Royal\u201d as their name on Instagram, where they have over 10 million followers. Since making their statement last week on Instagram and their own website, they have posted just one more thing online \u2013 a roundup of photographs of them visiting the women of the Hubb Community Kitchen, which was set up in the wake of Grenfell to cook meals for families and neighbours who had been displaced because of the fire. Here\u2019s a rundown from my colleague Caroline Davies of what we can expect from the day - and what both sides of the royal family will be hoping to get out of any agreement. The announcement from the Duke and Duchess of Sussex last week was quite unclear on the details about the role they are hoping to fulfil in the future. However, there may have been some hints in the Sunday papers. Writing in the Sunday Times, the ITV journalist Tom Bradby, who seems close to the couple, outlined what he felt they were looking to get out of any deal. \u201cThey appear philosophical about the prospect of losing their titles and becoming, in the end, entirely self-funded,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf I had to guess,\u201d he added \u201cI\u2019d say Meghan might take on a few big roles as a brand ambassador and do some work in television as an executive producer, perhaps on programmes that promote the causes and charities she has long been interested in. \u201cI imagine Harry will probably concentrate on the voluntary work he has done over the years \u2013 the Invictus Games, Sentebele \u2013 and if he were to step into the commercial space, I suspect it would be an area that already interests him, such as eco-tourism.\u201d One of the other issues that will be up for discussion is the future security arrangements for the couple and their young son Archie. Asked on BBC Radio 5 Live this morning about the possible options, the home secretary, Priti Patel, refused to comment, saying: \u201cI\u2019m not going to provide any detailed information on the security arrangements for either them or any members of the royal family or for any protected individuals \u2013 that\u2019s thoroughly inappropriate for me to do so.\u201d She went on to contradict Prince Harry\u2019s assessment that some of the negative coverage of his wife had been motivated by racism. She said: \u201cI\u2019m not in that category at all where I believe there\u2019s racism at all. I think we live in a great country, a great society, full of opportunity, where people of any background can get on in life.\u201d She added that she didn\u2019t think the media had been in any way racist, saying: \u201cI certainly haven\u2019t seen that through any debates or commentary or things of that nature.\u201d Harry has been critical of coverage of Meghan for some time. In November 2016 he issued a statement condemning what he called a \u201cwave of abuse and harassment\u201d from the British press and public. \u201cSome of this has been very public,\u201d the palace\u2019s statement read at the time. \u201cThe smear on the front page of a national newspaper; the racial undertones of comment pieces; and the outright sexism and racism of social media trolls and web article comments.\u201d In September last year, the BBC issued an apology to Prince Harry after it failed to warn the Duke of Sussex in advance before broadcasting and publishing online an image from a neo-Nazi social media group that called him a \u201crace traitor\u201d. Good morning, on a day that could prove to be pivotal for the future shape of the monarchy. While a lot of the wider coverage of the crisis caused by the sudden announcement from the Duke and Duchess of Sussex that they want to step back from senior roles in the royal family treats them like showbiz or celebrity characters, the move has significant constitutional implications for how the royal family is run and paid for, and what is expected from them in the future. Later today the Queen will gather her heir Prince Charles, and his sons Prince William and Prince Harry, for a meeting. Meghan is expected to be joining them via conference call, as they attempt to thrash out the next steps to a workable solution at the Queen\u2019s private Sandringham estate in eastern England. According to reports the issues up for debate will include how much money the couple will still receive from Charles\u2019s estate, their royal titles and what commercial deals they can strike. It\u2019s not entirely clear that much news will emerge from the meeting today \u2013 we may just end up with a \u201ctalks with continue\u201d.",

However, if, as has been reported and admitted, the Iranian missile struck the plane \u2018unintentionally\u2019 or mistakenly, which I consider to mean negligently, exposure to civil liability for the lives lost would be relatively clear,\u201d he wrote in an email to the Guardian\u2019s international correspondent Michael Safi. \u201cThis would mean that the survivors might be able to recover for their losses in US, Canadian, and I assume Ukrainian civil courts.\u201d </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There are technical procedural issues about filing suit, but the US and Canadian courts would be amenable to survivor suits. Plaintiffs could show liability and a judge or jury would likely rule in their favor, but it might be difficult for plaintiffs to find Iranian assets from which plaintiffs can be compensated. </p> \n   <p>There also may be international laws and treaties and perhaps tariffs that govern, but I think that the Iranian Government could be held responsible, because its officials clearly made the mistake. There may also be possible liability imposed on the airline for flying in this airspace given the recent tensions, but that seems less clear now. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p

You can read the full story here. The dispute over the arrest of Britain\u2019s ambassador to Tehran this weekend has escalated as the Foreign Office summoned the Iranian ambassador to protest about the incident. Rob Macaire was held briefly on Saturday as anti-government demonstrations broke out in Tehran. The ambassador was accused of taking part in the protests, a claim he denies. A spokesperson for the prime minister said: This was an unacceptable breach of the Vienna convention and it needs to be investigated. We are seeking full assurances from the Iranian government that this will never happen again. The FCO has summoned the Iranian ambassador today to convey our strong objections. Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister has told Reuters that representatives of five nations whose citizens died when an airliner was shot down by Iran last week will meet in London on Thursday to discuss possible legal action. One of Iran\u2019s most popular female actors has criticised the government in Tehran in a post on Instagram, telling her almost 6 million followers that \u201cwe are not citizens\u201d but \u201ccaptives\u201d. Taraneh Alidoosti \u2013 who has appeared in an Oscar-nominated film and acclaimed TV dramas \u2013 wrote: \u201cI fought this dream for a long time and didn\u2019t want to accept it. We are not citizens. We never were. We are captives.\u201d In a series of viral tweets, the head of a Canadian packaged meat company has lashed out at Donald Trump, suggesting the US president bears culpability for Iranian missiles that brought down Ukraine International Airlines Flight PS752 last week. Most of the 167 passengers on board were bound for Canada. \u201cU.S. government leaders unconstrained by checks/balances, concocted an ill-conceived plan to divert focus from political woes. The world knows Iran is a dangerous state, but the world found a path to contain it; not perfect but by most accounts it was the right direction,\u201d wrote Michael McCain, the chief executive of Maple Leaf Foods, calling Trump a \u201cnarcissist\u201dwho has destabilised the Middle East. \u201cThe collateral damage of this irresponsible, dangerous, ill-conceived behaviour? 63 Canadians needlessly lost their lives in the crossfire, including the family of one of my [Maple Leaf Food] colleagues (his wife + 11 year old son)! We are mourning and I am livid.\u201d The thread has been \u2018liked\u2019 more than 45,000 times, suggesting the post is striking a nerve with Canadians. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has so far resisted weighing in on the role US actions may have played in the tragedy. \u201cI think it is too soon to be drawing conclusions or assigning blame or responsibility in whatever proportions,\u201d he said last week. McCain\u2019s post \u2014 the boldest criticism so far from the Canadian business community \u2014 follows a series of emotional vigils across the country over the weekend. Speaking to thousands of mourners in Edmonton, Trudeau said the country would not rest until there was justice and accountability for victims and their families. Carl Tobias, professor of law at the University of Richmond, in the US state of Virginia, has commented on whether the families of victims of the Iran plane crash might be able to sue the Iranian government. \u201cMuch remains unclear, so caution is the byword. However, if, as has been reported and admitted, the Iranian missile struck the plane \u2018unintentionally\u2019 or mistakenly, which I consider to mean negligently, exposure to civil liability for the lives lost would be relatively clear,\u201d he wrote in an email to the Guardian\u2019s international correspondent Michael Safi. \u201cThis would mean that the survivors might be able to recover for their losses in US, Canadian, and I assume Ukrainian civil courts.\u201d There are technical procedural issues about filing suit, but the US and Canadian courts would be amenable to survivor suits. Plaintiffs could show liability and a judge or jury would likely rule in their favor, but it might be difficult for plaintiffs to find Iranian assets from which plaintiffs can be compensated. There also may be international laws and treaties and perhaps tariffs that govern, but I think that the Iranian Government could be held responsible, because its officials clearly made the mistake. There may also be possible liability imposed on the airline for flying in this airspace given the recent tensions, but that seems less clear now. It looks like the internet could be being throttled at Sharif University of Technology in Tehran, where there are protests. You can read some background to internet shutdowns in Iran here: This video posted by the BBC purports to show protesters outside Sharif University of Technology in Tehran chanting \u201ckill the mullahs\u201d. Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister has told Reuters that representatives of five nations whose citizens died when an airliner was shot down by Iran last week will meet in London on Thursday to discuss possible legal action. Speaking at the sidelines of an official visit to Singapore on Monday, Vadym Prystaiko said the countries would also discuss compensation and the investigation into the incident. Footage circulated by Iranian activists on Monday morning shows a new gathering at Tehran\u2019s Sharif University and another at the Sharif University in Isfahan, the first signs that the public demonstrations that erupted on Saturday may continue for a third day. \u201cBasiji go away!\u201d people in Isfahan are heard shouting, in reference to pro-regime militiamen. \u201cClerics must go!\u201d I\u2019ve also just heard a voice message from an activist in Tehran who says regime supporters are trying to take over public spaces: It is fucked around Valiasr Square [in Tehran]. They brought huge loudspeakers and are playing noha [lamentation songs]. And there are around 20 to 30 Revolutionary Guards in their uniforms. One of Iran\u2019s most popular female actors has bluntly criticised the government in Tehran in a post on Instagram, telling her almost 6 million followers that \u201cwe are not citizens\u201d but \u201ccaptives\u201d. Taraneh Alidoosti \u2013 who has appeared in an Oscar-nominated film and acclaimed TV dramas \u2013 wrote: \u201cI fought this dream for a long time and didn\u2019t want to accept it. We are not citizens. We never were. We are captives.\u201d Alidoosti said that she had replaced her profile picture with the colour black in mourning for demonstrators shot dead by security forces last November. The colour had nothing to do with official \u201cmourning\u201d following the assassination on 3 January of Iran\u2019s top general, Qassem Suleimani, by a US drone, she said.

Iran\u2019s government spokesman has dismissed tweets by Donald Trump, telling the country\u2019s authorities in Farsi and English not to kill protesters and praising the \u201cgreat Iranian people\u201d.

The prime minister\u2019s spokesman said: In relation to the arrest of the UK\u2019s ambassador over the weekend, I would say this was an unacceptable breach of the Vienna convention and it needs to be investigated. We are seeking full assurances from the Iranian government that this will never happen again. The FCO has summoned the Iranian ambassador today to convey our strong objections. Downing Street has also indicated that the families of the victims of the downed Ukraine International Airlines flight could seek compensation from the Iranian government. Downing Street has indicated that the families of the victims of the downed Ukraine International Airlines flight could seek compensation from the Iranian government. The prime minister\u2019s official spokesman told journalists in Westminster: As a first step we need a comprehensive, transparent and independent investigation to know exactly what happened. Of course, the families of the four British victims deserve justice and closure and we will continue to do everything we can to support them in getting that, including options for compensation. The Foreign Office has summoned Iran\u2019s ambassador to the UK, Hamid Baeidinejad, to protest at the brief detention of Rob Macaire, the British ambassador in Tehran, Downing Street has said. Macaire was held briefly on Saturday as anti-government demonstrations broke out in Tehran over the shooting down of a Ukrainian airliner by Iranian forces.

The meeting is expected to take place this afternoon. Domonic Raab, the UK foreign secretary, will update MPs on Iran when he speaks to the Commons in the Queen\u2019s speech debate later on Monday. From the Telegraph\u2019s Middle East correspondent: Michael H Fuchs, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, and a former deputy assistant secretary of state for east Asian and Pacific affairs, has written in the Guardian that we cannot allow Trump\u2019s approach to foreign policy to be normalised. After three years of dangerously and unnecessarily escalating tensions with Iran, Donald Trump rang in the new year by creating a crisis that almost started a war with Iran \u2013 and still very well could. As we enter the fourth year of Trump\u2019s presidency, it is more necessary than ever to remind ourselves daily: this is not normal. The list of despicable domestic actions by Trump that must not be normalized is long \u2013 from the policy separating migrant children from their parents and detaining them in cages to the president\u2019s call for his critics to be investigated or jailed. Here\u2019s a useful visual guide to what we know about the crashing of Ukraine International Airlines flight 752: From the Guardian\u2019s diplomatic editor: Reuters is reporting that Iran\u2019s government spokesman has dismissed tweets by Trump telling the country\u2019s authorities in Farsi and English not to kill protesters. The US president praised the \u201cgreat Iranian people\u201d. Ali Rabiei said Trump was shedding \u201ccrocodile tears\u201d when voicing concern for Iranians. Rabiei said Britain\u2019s ambassador to Iran had acted in a way that was \u201ccompletely unprofessional and unacceptable\u201d, after he was briefly detained near a protest. The envoy said he was arrested after attending a vigil and had left when it turned political. Iranian authorities appear to have fired live ammunition to disperse protesters in Tehran, wounding several people, according to witness accounts provided to the Guardian and footage circulating on social media. Our international correspondent, Michael Safi, has reported that security forces initially fired teargas to disperse the crowds and then started firing bullets. \u201cIt was a very bad situation,\u201d the woman, who asked not to be identified, said in a message provided to the Iranian activist Masih Alinejad. Tehran\u2019s police chief said in a statement on Monday that no shots were fired during Sunday\u2019s events and that officers were under orders to show restraint. Read the full story here: France and Russia have a shared desire to safeguard Iran\u2019s nuclear deal, French President Emmanuel Macron has said. According to Reuters, Macron said in a statement he had a phone call on Sunday with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who said he remained committed to the deal. Leaders of Britain, France and Germany on Sunday called on Iran to return to full compliance with a 2015 nuclear deal with world powers and refrain from further violence. The crashing of the Ukrainian Airlines jet outside Tehran has drawn inevitable comparisons with MH17, brought down over the east of Ukraine by a Russian missile five years ago. The Guardian\u2019s central and eastern Europe correspondent Shaun Walker reports on how \u2013 yet again \u2013 Ukraine has been dragged into a conflict not of its own making. \u201cUkraine seems to have a dark cloud over it,\u201d said Alina Polyakova of the Brookings Institution. \u201cIt\u2019s fighting a war against Russia, and has become part of the political war in the US. This tragedy again puts Ukraine in the middle of conflicts that have nothing to do with it.\u201d While the plane\u2019s shooting down had a terrible cost in human life, Ukraine\u2019s unwanted starring role in the US impeachment disaster has come with costs to military aid, political alliances and reputation. \u201cIt\u2019s a catastrophe,\u201d said Pavlo Klimkin, who was the country\u2019s foreign minister until last August. \u201cUkraine now has the reputation of a place that can cause all kinds of trouble. It\u2019s the opposite of everything we were working for.\u201d You can read our latest story on the events in Iran from Guardian international correspondent, Michael Safi, here. The resurgent anti-government protests threaten to tip Iran\u2019s regime into crisis just as it was riding a wave of nationalist sentiment after the killing of top general Qassem Suleimani by a US drone strike on 3 January. Iran\u2019s response \u2013 a carefully calibrated but heavily publicised ballistic missile attack on US forces in Iraq last Wednesday \u2013 was supposed to bring catharsis and demonstrate the regime\u2019s power. Instead, by leading to the shooting down of a passenger jet loaded with Iranian citizens, it has humiliated the military and exposed some of its top leaders as having lied to the country for days until the admission on Saturday morning that an Iranian missile was responsible for the crash. Two state TV hosts resigned in protest over false reporting over the incident and Iranian media outlets joined the outcry, running front-page headlines that read, \u201cAshamed\u201d and \u201cUnbelievable\u201d. The governments of France, Germany and the UK \u2013 the \u201cE3\u201d \u2013 issued a statement yesterday saying that they were still committed to the Iran nuclear deal, despite the collapse in Iran/US relations. They said: Today, our message is clear: we remain committed to the JCPoA [Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action] and to preserving it; we urge Iran to reverse all measures inconsistent with the agreement and return to full compliance; we call on Iran to refrain from further violent action or proliferation; and we remain ready to engage with Iran on this agenda in order to preserve the stability of the region. But President Donald Trump tweeted late last night UK time that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t care less\u201d if Iran wanted to negotiate with the US. He was responding to comments by the national security adviser, Robert O\u2019Brien, who said sanctions were ramping up pressure on Tehran and that the country was \u201cgoing to have no other choice but to come to the table\u201d. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the protests in Iran and the fallout from the downing of a passenger jet outside Tehran last week. Authorities in Iran are struggling to contain public anger after they admitted on Saturday that the country\u2019s military was responsible for shooting down a commercial airliner with 176 people onboard. Police used teargas to break up a second day of protests in Tehran on Sunday, with demonstrations spreading to other cities. Speaking at a vigil yesterday, the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, his voice sometimes breaking, said he would \u201cpursue justice and accountability\u201d for those killed in the disaster. At least 57 Canadians died in the crash, most of them of Iranian descent, in one of the biggest single losses of life the country has suffered in 40 years. \u201cYou may feel unbearably lonely, but you are not alone. Your entire country stands with you, tonight, tomorrow, and in all the years to come,\u201d he told a crowd of 1,700 in Edmonton, Alberta, home to 13 of the victims. Meanwhile, both Boris Johnson and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, have condemned the brief arrest and detention on Saturday of the British ambassador to Iran, Rob Macaire. Macaire said he had attended an event that advertised itself as being a vigil for those who died in the crash, but Tehran said it had summoned the ambassador to justify his \u201cillegal and inappropriate presence\u201d at the protest.

Business The government fightback against the next recession should include pumping as much as \u00a350bn into green projects, in a move that would help reboot the economy and tackle the climate emergency, according to the left-leaning thinktank New Economics Foundation.

Many considered Suleimani to have been the second most powerful person in Iran, behind supreme leader of Iran Ali Khamenei, but arguably ahead of President Hassan Rouhani. He was commander of the Quds Force, the elite, external wing of the Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which the Trump administration designated as a terror organisation in April last year.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>He was born in Rabor, a city in eastern Iran, and forced to travel to a neighbouring city at age 13 and work to pay his father\u2019s debts to the government of the Shah. By the time the monarch fell in 1979, Suleimani was committed to the clerical rule of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and joined the Revolutionary Guards, the paramilitary force established to prevent a coup against the newly declared Islamic Republic.</p>\n    <p>Within two years, he was sent to the front to fight in the war against the invading Iraqi army. He quickly distinguished himself, especially for daring reconnaissance missions behind Iraqi lines, and the war also gave him his first contact with foreign militias of the kind he would wield to devastating effect in the decades to come.</p>\n    <p>By the the time the Iraq government fell in 2003, Suleimani was the head of the Quds force and blamed for sponsoring the Shia militias who killed thousands of civilian Iraqis and coalition troops. As fighting raged on Iraq\u2019s streets, Suleimani fought a shadow war with the US for leverage over the new Iraqi leadership.</p>\n    <p>Once described by American commander David Petraeus as \u2018a truly evil figure\u2019, Suleimani was instrumental in crushing street protests in Iran in 2009. In recent months outbreaks of popular dissent in Lebanon, Iraq and Iran were again putting pressure on the crescent of influence he had spent the past two decades building. Violent crackdowns on the protests in Baghdad were blamed on militias under his influence.<br></p>\n    <p>Eighteen months before his death, Suleimani had issued Donald Trump a public warning, wagging his finger and dressed in olive fatigues. \u201cYou will start the war but we will end it.\u201d</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/michael-safi\"><b>Michael Safi</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Meanwhile, Ukraine\u2019s government demanded justice for the victims, including compensation.

The secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SecPompeo/status/1216064377444618240?s=20\">tweeted</a> his support for the Iranian people, who he said were \u201cfed up with the regime\u2019s lies, corruption, ineptitude, and brutality\u201d.</p> \n<p>Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1216114135529902081?s=20\">tweeted</a> his support for the Iranian people in English and Farsi. \u201cTo the brave, long-suffering people of Iran: I\u2019ve stood with you since the beginning of my presidency, and my administration will continue to stand with you.

The mea culpa came after three days of denials from officials in Tehran, who repeatedly dismissed western intelligence reports pointing to Iranian culpability as propaganda amid soaring tensions with the US. In an unprecedented move, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ordered an investigation into the hitherto untouchable Islamic revolutionary guard corps (IRGC), whose base outside Tehran launched the missile that downed Flight 752.

The aircraft was targeted by two surface-to-air missiles three minutes after taking off from an airport on the outskirts of Tehran. It took to the air a few hours after Iran launched a barrage of ballistic missiles at US targets in Iraq and the military were braced for possible reprisals. The plane, en route to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, was carrying 167 passengers and nine crew members from several countries, including 82 Iranians, at least 57 Canadians, 11 Ukrainians and three Britons. The Iranian strikes on Iraqi bases last week were in turn retaliation for the US drone strike that killed the al-Quds force leader, Suleimani, in Baghdad on 3 January \u2013 the culmination of a recent series of tit-for-tat attacks that threatened to push Washington and Tehran into war. Iran\u2019s admission was met with some relief by investigators and victims\u2019 families, who had initially feared the truth about what happened to the aircraft would be obstructed, as has been the case with the Malaysia Airlines flight downed in Ukraine six years ago. However, explanations from Iranian officials so far have raised fresh questions about why and how the commercial flight was targeted, and why it took so long for Iran to take responsibility. Flight tracking website FlightRadar24 showed the plane following its normal route and travelling at just over 500 kmh \u2013 far slower than a cruise missile. Nine flights had left Tehran\u2019s Imam Khomeini international airport that morning before the Ukrainian airliner without encountering trouble. Air crash experts have raised serious concerns since the accident over the handling of the crash site, including the removal of debris, sparking fears that Tehran has sought to eliminate evidence from the area.

Here\u2019s a summary of what has happened today and you can read the latest story from our Turkey and Middle East correspondent Bethan McKernan here. Iran has admitted that its military unintentionally shot down a Ukrainian jetliner as it flew from its capital, killing all 176 people onboard, after days of rejecting western intelligence claims that it had been hit by an Iranian surface to air missile. Iran\u2019s ambassador to the UK, Hamid Baeidinejad, tweeted his apologies for circulating misleading statements. Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has demanded that Iran punish those responsible for the downing of the airliner, as well as pay compensation and apologise. Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards accepted responsibility for shooting down UIA 752. Boris Johnson has called Iran\u2019s admission it shot down a passenger plane by mistake an \u201cimportant first step\u201d. Catch up on news and analysis of the disaster: Iran admits unintentionally shooting down Ukrainian airliner Iran plane crash admission triggers international calls for full investigation Iran plane crash admission sparks unrest in Tehran Iranian President Hassan Rouhani promised further investigation into the downing of an Ukrainian passenger plane during a phone conversation with Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau on Saturday, state news agency IRNA reported. \u201cIran welcomes any international cooperation in the framework of international regulations to shed more light on the incident,\u201d Rouhani said, promising further investigation into the crash that Tehran said was caused by its air defences \u201cunintentionally\u201d. Iran and Canada cut diplomatic ties in 2012. In related news, German chancellor Angela Merkel repeated a call for all parties to respect the Iranian nuclear accord, despite Iran\u2019s decision to intensify its enrichment of uranium and moves by the United States to impose economic sanctions, PA reports. Under a deal brokered in 2015, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Iran agreed with China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States, to restrict its nuclear program. Merkel said: \u201cWe agreed that we should do anything to preserve the deal, the JCPOA. Germany is convinced that Iran should not acquire or have nuclear weapons,\u201d Merkel said during a joint press conference with Russian president Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Saturday. \u201cFor this reason we will continue to employ all diplomatic means to keep this agreement alive, which is certainly not perfect but it is an agreement and it comprises commitments by all sides.\u201d Unlike the US, which on Friday imposed new economic sanctions on Iran, the Europeans have given Tehran more time to avoid nuclear proliferation rather than begin a process that could lead to a reimposition of UN sanctions. Canada\u2019s prime minister Justin Trudeau is due to speak shortly, his third press conference since the plane was shot down on Wednesday morning. Meanwhile, Canadian officials have expressed frustration over an inability to access the crash site\u2014 despite an invitation from Iranian officials to do so. Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne, Canada\u2019s foreign minister, told reporters Friday evening that only two of the 10 members of the delegation had been granted visas for travel to Iran while they waited in Turkey. Two officials from Canada\u2019s transportation safety board are also waiting for proper documentation. In Canada, there have been calls from the Iranian Canadian community for those responsible for downing the aircraft to be held accountable. Payman Parseyan, former president of the Iranian Heritage Society of Edmonton, has tweeted an emotional statement following Iran\u2019s admission it brought down the plane. He said: \u201cThere are no winners in this story and only communities left devastated. Iran\u2019s government has yet to be held accountable and answer for this tragedy that took the lives of some [of] our brightest, our friends, neighbours and fellow Canadian[s].\u201d Meanwhile the Iranian Canadian congress said in a statement following the news, reiterating calls for a thorough investigation. \u201cThose who have committed this crime of shooting down a passenger airplane and those who have been responsible in releasing false information must be held accountable. \u201cThe families of the victims of this horrible tragedy must be supported in any way deemed appropriate and desired by the families, including through restitution.\u201d Reuters is reporting that Iran\u2019s Fars news agency has published a report on the protests in Tehran, which have sprung up following the admission that the passenger plane was shot down. This is unusual as the agency, which is widely seen as close to the the powerful Revolutionary Guards, rarely reports on anti-government unrest. The report said protesters were chanting slogans against the nation\u2019s top authorities and that demonstrators on the street had also ripped up pictures of Qassem Soleimani, the prominent commander of the Guard\u2019s Quds Force who was killed in a US drone strike. The agency carried pictures of the gathering and a torn banner of Soleimani. It said the protesters numbered about 700 to 1,000 people. Iran\u2019s civil aviation authority has said that Ukrainian International Airlines flight 752 did not veer off its normal course before an anti-aircraft battery launched a missile at it. The latest admission over the downing of the flight with the loss of 176 passengers comes after UIA\u2019s president and vice-president reacted angrily to what they saw as hints by the Iranian authorities that their crew was in some way to blame for the incident. Protesters in Tehran are demanding the resignation of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, according to a Reuters report that offers some context to the footage in tweets embedded in an earlier post. \u201cCommander-in-chief [Khamenei] resign, resign,\u201d the videos showed hundreds of people chanting in front of Tehran\u2019s Amirkabir University. Reuters said it could not verify the authenticity of the video footage. The Ukrainian prosecutor general\u2019s office has said it is investigating possible wilfil killing and aircraft destruction in its probe of the crash of a Ukrainian airliner in Iran, Reuters reports. As Iranians protest over their government\u2019s mishandling of the downing of Ukrainian International Airlines flight 752, in London Labour\u2019s Jeremy Corbyn has addressed hundreds marching against the prospect of war with Iran. The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND), which co-organised the demonstration with the Stop the War Coalition, is carrying photos of the protest on its Twitter feed. Following on from the previous report about domestic reaction to the Iranian mea culpa, reports are emerging on Twitter of protests in the street in Tehran over the government\u2019s handling of the fiasco. Reuters has some domestic Iranian reaction to Iranian government admitting its forces shot down the Ukrainian airliner just outside of Tehran, with many in the country angry at what appears to be incompetence and dishonesty by their leaders. Expressions of condolence over the incident from Supreme Leader and President Hassan Rouhani failed to calm angry Iranians, who used social media to express their outrage against the establishment for concealing the truth. \u201cIt is a national tragedy. The way it was handled and it was announced by the authorities was even more tragic,\u201d said Ali Ansari, a moderate cleric, according to Iran\u2019s semi-official ILNA news agency. Many Iranians asked why authorities did not close down Tehran\u2019s airport and the country\u2019s airspace at a time when they would have been on alert for retaliation after the missile strikes. There were no fatalities in those strikes, launched to avenge the US killing of top Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani in a drone strike in Baghdad on 3 January. \u201cThey were so careful not to kill any American in their revenge for Soleimani. But they did not close the airport? This shows how much this regime cares for Iranians,\u201d said Mira Sedaghati in Tehran by telephone. An Iranian military statement carried by state media said the Ukrainian plane, which was headed for Kiev, was mistaken for a \u201chostile target\u201d after it turned toward a sensitive military base of the elite Revolutionary Guards near Tehran, adding that it was a \u201chuman error and unintentional\u201d. \u201cUnintentionally? What does it mean? They concealed this huge tragic news for days just to mourn for Soleimani. Shame on you,\u201d said Reza Ghadyani, in Tabriz city. The country held three days of funeral processions for Soleimani, who was head of the Revolutionary Guards\u2019 overseas Quds Force and a national hero. Hundreds of thousands of people participated across the country. Some Iranians called for resignation of officials, dismissing their apologies. \u201cYou took your revenge from Iranians,\u201d tweeted Ahmad Batebi on his @radiojibi Twitter account, in response to Rouhani\u2019s tweet saying that \u201cThe Islamic Republic of Iran deeply regrets this disastrous mistake\u201d. \u201cOnly resignation,\u201d tweeted Sadeq on his @sadeq1367 account In a Twitter message on Saturday, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif cast some of the blame for the plane disaster on what he called U.S. adventurism. \u201cIt\u2019s the end line Mr. Minister! You ruined everything!,\u201d responded Bita Razaqi on @bitarazaqi. Boris Johnson has called Iran\u2019s admission it shot down a passenger plane by mistake an \u201cimportant first step\u201d and said it \u201creinforces the importance of de-escalating tensions in the region\u201d. In a statement, the prime minister said: Iran\u2019s admission that Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 was shot down by mistake by its own armed forces is an important first step. This will be an incredibly difficult time for all those families who lost loved ones in such tragic circumstances. We will do everything we can to support the families of the four British victims and ensure they get the answers and closure they deserve. We now need a comprehensive, transparent and independent international investigation and the repatriation of those who died. The UK will work closely with Canada, Ukraine and our other international partners affected by this accident to ensure this happens. This tragic accident only reinforces the importance of de-escalating tensions in the region. We can all see very clearly that further conflict will only lead to more loss and tragedy. It is vital that all leaders now pursue a diplomatic way forward. A video is circulating on Twitter that purports to show the moment that the surface to air missile that downed UIA flight 752 was launched by Iranian Revolutionary Guards. Reuters is now running more detail on the comments by Ukraine International Airlines\u2019 president and vice-president at the press conference they took earlier this afternoon, where they denied suggestions that their crew were in some way responsible for the downing of the jet. Ukraine International Airlines said on Saturday that its plane that crashed in Iran this week had received no warning from Tehran airport about a possible threat to its safety before it took off en route for Kiev. At a briefing by its president and vice-president, the airline also denied the aircraft veered off its normal course after an Iranian military statement said the plane flew close to a sensitive military site of the elite Revolutionary Guards. The airline officials bristled at what they said were hints from Iran that the crew had not acted properly. Iran said earlier that its military mistakenly shot down the plane, saying air defences were fired in error while on high alert in the tense aftermath of Iranian missile strikes on US targets in Iraq. All 176 people onboard were killed. The airline officials called on Iran to take full responsibility for the crash and said the Iranian authorities should have closed the airport. \u201cIf you play at war, you play as much as you want, but there are normal people around who you had to protect,\u201d Vice-president Ihor Sosnovsky said. \u201cIf they are shooting from somewhere to somewhere, they were obliged to close the airport. Obliged. And then shoot as much as you want.\u201d He added that the plane had turned 15 degrees to the right after it had reached 6,000 feet, in accordance with the instructions of the airport dispatcher. Yevhenii Dykhne, the president and chief executive of the airline, made an emotional opening statement to reporters saying the airline had not done anything wrong in terms of following security procedures. \u201cAt the time of departure from ([Kyiv\u2019s] Boryspil airport, the airline had no information about possible threats,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the time of departure from Tehran airport, it was exactly the same.\u201d The airline said Tehran airport was operating normally at the time its aircraft took off. Asked why there had been a delay in take-off, Dykhne said the captain had decided to offload some luggage because the plane was too heavily loaded. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has spoken to Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, about the investigation into the downing of the aircraft, a statement from the Ukrainian president\u2019s office said. The presidents have agreed to ask French specialists to decode the plane\u2019s black box. Macron said the formal procedure to launch the international investigation had been started and he would visit Kiev. The relatively quick admission by Iran that Ukraine International Airlines flight 752 was shot down by mistake has drawn comparisons with how Russia handled the MH17 case. Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 was shot down over Ukraine by a Buk surface-to-air missile on 17 July 2014. Russia has always denied it played any role in the tragedy, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Nick Waters, an investigator for Bellingcat, an independent investigative website that has been investigating the MH17 crash, has tweeted to say it had been preparing for a similar scenario to play out again with Iran denying involvement. Protesters were due to be gathering outside the BBC\u2019s London HQ at midday to demonstrate against war with Iran, even as attention is deflected for the time being on to the issue of Iran\u2019s accidental shooting down of a Ukrainian airliner. The demonstration, organised by the ever-busy Stop the War Coalition, starts outside BBC Broadcasting House and will march to Trafalgar Square where speakers will address the rally. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, are among the prominent figures expected to join the demo, along with the musician Brian Eno and the standup comic Tez Ilyas. In a statement sent out ahead of the demonstration, Kate Hudson, the general secretary of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, said: US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, the re-imposition of crippling sanctions on the Iranian economy and the US extra-judicial killing in a sovereign state are all steps to war. The danger of war remains high and the prime minister must exert every influence to ensure a peaceful resolution to the crisis. Unless the sanctions are lifted, war and nuclear proliferation are a real threat. Britain must do more to alleviate the sanctions and push to salvage the Iran nuclear deal. The chief of Ukrainian International Airlines, Evgeniy Dikhne, has rejected claims by Iran that the shooting down of its airliner was in some way prompted by a mistake by his crew. Speaking at a press conference arranged before Iran\u2019s surprise admission of responsibility for shooting down UIA flight 752, Dikhne stressed that his company had received no indication from Iranian or international civil aviation authorities that it would be unsafe to fly over the country. He added: Currently, even within the statement by Iran there was a hint saying that our crew has been doing something independently or has been doing something not in the way that they have have been behaving. The vice-president of UIA, Igor Sosnovskiy, continued, saying that Tehran airport had been fully open and operational, despite the tensions between Iran and the US. He spoke of the competency of the crew, who had clocked up thousands of hours of flight time. Iran should have closed the airport, Sosnovskiy said, and having failed to do so the country must take full responsibility for the downing of the jet and the lives lost. A thread here by Reza Khaasteh, a journalist with Iran Front Page news, translates in more detail the statements by the Revolutionary Guards\u2019 Gen Amir Ali Hajizadeh in a press conference in which he admits his unit\u2019s responsibility for shooting down UIA 752. The head of the aerospace division of Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards has said he \u201cwishes he could die\u201d, as his unit accepted responsibility for shooting down UIA 752. \u201cI wish I could die and not witness such an accident,\u201d Gen Amir Ali Hajizadeh said in a video posted online by Iranian state TV on Saturday. According to translations by Reuters, Hajizadeh says he told authorities on Wednesday about the unintentional missile attack, and that the plane was brought down by a short-range missile. He says he partly blames the attack on the US, for its assassination of the Iranian general Qassem Suleimani on Iraqi soil last week, which heightened tensions in the region and led to a tit-for-tat strike by Iran on US bases. The former government minister Alistair Burt has commented on the Iranian ambassador\u2019s tweeted apology, saying it is unprecedented and that he has never seen such comments from anyone in that capacity. Burt is one of many on Twitter saying that Hamid Baeidinejad\u2019s admission of guilt is very unusual in a world where issuing denials even in the face of incontrovertible evidence, is usually how states operate. In a statement issued by Justin Trudeau\u2019s office after Iran acknowledged the plane was brought down by its own armed forces, the Canadian prime minister said: Our focus remains closure, accountability, transparency, and justice for the families and loved ones of the victims. This is a national tragedy, and all Canadians are mourning together. We will continue working with our partners around the world to ensure a complete and thorough investigation, and the Canadian government expects full cooperation from Iranian authorities. Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has joined calls for an investigation into the downing of UIA 752, as well as offering his condolences to the relatives of victims. Khamenei on Saturday expressed his deep sympathy to the families of the 176 victims, and called on the armed forces to \u201cpursue probable shortcomings and guilt in the painful incident\u201d, according to the Associated Press. Reuters earlier reported that Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards, who answer directly to Khamenei, have said they will offer their own explanation and apology for the incident. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has made his first comments on the Iranian admission of guilt today. He says the Canadian government expects \u201cfull cooperation from Iranian authorities\u201d and that its officials \u201cwill continue working with our partners around the world to ensure a complete and thorough investigation\u201d. Credit for Iran\u2019s decision to apologise over the shooting down of UIA flight 752 should be given to the investigative news website Bellingcat, suggests Tom Tugendhat, the Conservative MP for Tonbridge and Malling. Of course, Bellingcat was far from the only organisation reporting that the downing of the airliner was the result of an Iranian missile strike. But its impressive geolocation work cannot have hurt in pinning down the truth. Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has demanded that Iran punish those responsible for the downing of the airliner, as well as pay compensation and apologise. \u201cWe expect Iran ... to bring the guilty to the courts,\u201d Zelenskiy wrote on Facebook, calling also for the return of remains, according to comments translated and reported by AFP. \u201cWe hope the inquiry will be pursued without deliberate delay and without obstruction,\u201d Zelenskiy added. He said he wanted \u201ctotal access\u201d to the full inquiry for 45 Ukrainian experts, and in a tweet also sought an official apology. Our writers Luke Harding and Peter Beaumont have written the story of the final moments of Ukraine International Airlines flight 752. The plane would have appeared on the radar screen of Iran\u2019s Mehrabad air traffic control centre, which cleared the crew to ascend to 26,000ft. Staff should have identified the Boeing 737-800 plane as a regular civilian jet. Also tracking the skies over Tehran were American satellites. If further missiles were hurled at US targets in Iraq the US\u2019s Space-Based Infrared System would immediately detect them. At 6.15am the system picked up something ominous: the unmistakable heat signature of missiles freshly launched. An Iranian garrison on the ground, due west of the airport, appears to have mistaken the plane for a hostile American object. According to US officials, an Iranian anti-aircraft battery unleashed two Russian-made missiles. The US satellites recorded an infrared blip: an explosion. The results were immediate and catastrophic. Read more: A lot of U-turns on Twitter this morning. Iran\u2019s ambassador to the UK, Hamid Baeidinejad, has tweeted his apologies for circulating misleading statements. The head of the Ukrainian state security service (SBU) says Iran\u2019s statement confirms one of his organisation\u2019s working theories about what caused the crash. Contrary to what some experts had said initially, the SBU thought Iran\u2019s anti-aircraft missile system had been operated manually rather than automatically, Ivan Bakanov said, according to Reuters. Bakanov\u2019s statement came as the head of the airline operating the plane said he had been sure that it was not his staff who were at fault. We did not for a second doubt that our crew and our plane could have been the cause of this terrible, awful air catastrophe, Evgeniy Dikhne said on Facebook. \u201cThey were our best guys and girls. The best.\u201d Iran has admitted that its military unintentionally shot down a Ukrainian jetliner as it flew from its capital, killing all 176 people onboard, after days of rejecting western intelligence claims that it had been hit by an Iranian surface to air missile. A military statement early on Saturday via state TV blamed \u201chuman error\u201d for the downing of Ukraine International Airlines flight 752 on Wednesday. It was followed by an apology from Iran\u2019s president. The downing of the airliner came in the midst of rising tensions between Iran and the US. Iran had just launched reciprocal rocket attacks on US bases in the Middle East after Trump ordered the assassination one of Iran\u2019s top military leaders with a drone strike in Baghdad last week.",

A statement on Iran\u2019s official IRNA news agency on Saturday morning said the military had made an \u201cunforgivable mistake\u201d in targeting Ukraine International Airlines flight 752 shortly after it took off from Tehran\u2019s international airport on Wednesday. It was followed by condolences from Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and an apology from the country\u2019s president, Hassan Rouhani. The Boeing 737 was hit by two surface-to-air missiles in the hours after Tehran launched ballistic missile strikes on US military bases in Iraq. The airliner was downed as a result of human error at a time when miltary forces were on high alert, the statement said. Iranian officials had previously denied a missile strike was to blame, dismissing the allegations as western propaganda and blaming mechanical malfunction. Saturday\u2019s statement was greeted with some relief that the immediate cause of the disaster had been made clear, but Ukraine, Canada and other countries with citizens among the victims have since made fresh calls for further measures from Tehran. The Ukrainian president, Volodymy Zelenskiy, said: \u201cEven before the termination of the international commission, Iran has pleaded guilty to crashing the Ukrainian plane. But we insist on full admission of guilt. We expect from Iran assurances of readiness for full and open investigation, bringing those responsible to justice, returning the bodies of the dead, payment of compensation, official apologies through diplomatic channels.\u201d He later wrote on Facebook: \u201cWe expect Iran ... to bring the guilty to the courts,\u201d , adding that he was scheduled to speak to Rouhani on Saturday afternoon. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said his country\u2019s focus was on \u201cclosure, accountability, transparency and justice\u201d for the families of the 57 Canadian victims. Iran has invited investigators from Canada, Ukraine and Boeing to visit the accident site on the outskirts of Tehran and said it would welcome representatives of other countries whose citizens had died. Responsible parties would be held accountable, Iran\u2019s military said, and its systems would be upgraded to prevent such mistakes in future. Khamenei said he sent deep sympathy to the families of the victims and expressed a desire for a comprehensive investigation. He called on the armed forces to \u201cpursue probable shortcomings and guilt in the painful incident\u201d. The acknowledgement of responsibility has renewed questions about why authorities did not shut down the country\u2019s main international airport and its airspace after launching the missile attacks on Iraq when they feared US reprisals were possible. The strikes on the two US bases on Iraqi soil were retaliation for the US drone strike that killed the powerful Quds force leader Qassem Suleimani in Baghdad on 3 January, the culmination of months of tit-for-tat attacks that recently threatened to push Washington and Tehran into war. It also undermines the credibility of information provided by senior Iranian officials so far. As recently as Friday, Ali Abedzadeh, the head of the national aviation department, told reporters with certainty that a missile had not caused the crash. The cabinet spokesman, Ali Rabiei, dismissed reports of a missile on Thursday, saying they rubbed salt on a painful wound for families of the victims.

He said an officer made the \u201cbad decision\u201d to open fire on the plane after mistaking it for a cruise missile. The public acknowledgement is likely to inflame public sentiment inside Iran against the authorities after citizens rallied around their leaders in the wake of Suleimani\u2019s killing. The vast majority of the passengers on the plane were Iranians or Iranian-Canadians, and the crash came a few weeks after a widespread crackdown on protests triggered by a rise in fuel prices. The flight, which was bound for Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, was carrying 167 passengers and nine crew from several countries, including 82 Iranians, at least 57 Canadians, 11 Ukrainians and three Britons. The semi-official Fars news agency reported that Khamenei had ordered top security officials to review the crash on Friday morning and announce the results. \u201cIf some individuals, in any position, were aware of the issue but made statements contradicting the reality or hid the truth for any reason, they should be named and tried,\u201d said Fars, which is close to the Revolutionary Guards.

          "bodyText": "Iran has admitted its military made an \u201cunforgivable mistake\u201d in unintentionally shooting down a Ukrainian jetliner and killing all 176 people onboard, after days of rejecting western intelligence reports that pointed to Tehran being responsible. A military statement on state TV early on Saturday blamed \u201chuman error\u201d for the downing of Ukraine International Airlines flight 752 on Wednesday in the tense aftermath of strikes on US targets. It was followed by an apology from Iran\u2019s president and condolences from the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, responded on Saturday morning that Iran must make an official apology and agree to a full investigation and compensation, as well as cooperating with Ukraine\u2019s own investigators. \u201cOur 45 professionals should have full access and cooperation to establish justice,\u201d a statement from the presidency said. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau ,also said his country\u2019s focus remained on \u201cclosure, accountability, transparency and justice\u201d for the families of the 57 Canadian victims. Hassan Rouhani, the Iranian president, wrote on Saturday: \u201cThe Islamic Republic of Iran deeply regrets this disastrous mistake. My thoughts and prayers go to all the mourning families. I offer my sincerest condolences.\u201d The Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, wrote: \u201cA sad day. Preliminary conclusions of internal investigation by armed forces: human error at time of crisis caused by US adventurism led to disaster. Our profound regrets, apologies and condolences to our people, to the families of all victims, and to other affected nations.\u201d The plane was mistaken for a hostile target after it turned towards a sensitive military centre of the Revolutionary Guards, according to the military statement, carried on the official IRNA news agency. \u201cThe military was at its highest level of readiness\u201d amid the heightened tensions with the US, it said, adding: \u201cIn such a condition, because of human error and in an unintentional way, the flight was hit.\u201d The military apologised for the disaster and said it would upgrade its systems to prevent such mistakes in the future. The responsible parties would be referred to a judicial department within the military and held accountable, it said. A fuller explanation and apology would be forthcoming from Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards later on Saturday, IRNA news reported, citing an informed source within the Guards. The jetliner, a Boeing 737-800, went down on the outskirts of Tehran during takeoff a few hours after Iran had launched a barrage of missiles at US forces in Iraq in the early hours of Wednesday. The strikes on two US bases were in retaliation for the US drone strike that killed the al-Quds force leader, Qassem Suleimani, in Baghdad on 3 January \u2013 the culmination of a recent series of tit-for-tat attacks that threatened to push Washington and Tehran into war. Iran\u2019s acknowledgement of responsibility renews questions of why authorities did not shut down the country\u2019s main international airport and its airspace after launching ballistic missile attacks, when they feared US reprisals were possible. It also undermines the credibility of information provided by senior Iranian officials so far. As recently as Friday, Ali Abedzadeh, the head of the national aviation department, told reporters with certainty that a missile had not caused the crash. On Thursday, the cabinet spokesman Ali Rabiei had also dismissed reports of a missile strike. Zelenskiy said: \u201cEven before the termination of the International Commission, Iran has pleaded guilty to crashing the Ukrainian plane. But we insist on full admission of guilt. We expect from Iran assurances of readiness for full and open investigation, bringing those responsible to justice, returning the bodies of the dead, payment of compensation, official apologies through diplomatic channels.\u201d The acknowledgement is also likely to inflame public sentiment inside the country against authorities after Iranians had rallied around their leaders following Suleimani\u2019s killing. The general was seen as a national icon and hundreds of thousands of people turned out for funeral processions across the country. The vast majority of the crash victims were Iranians or Iranian-Canadians, however, and it came just weeks after authorities quashed nationwide protests ignited by a hike in fuel prices. \u201cThis is the right step for the Iranian government to admit responsibility, and it gives people a step toward closure with this admission,\u201d said Payman Parseyan, a prominent Iranian-Canadian in western Canada who lost a number of friends in the crash. \u201cI think the investigation would have disclosed it whether they admitted it or not. This will give them an opportunity to save face.\u201d Iran had denied for several days that missiles could have downed the aircraft and instead blamed a mechanical malfunction. Western security officials began briefing on Thursday afternoon that intelligence suggested the plane had been accidentally shot down by two surface-to-air missiles fired by the Iranian military. A preliminary report released by Iran\u2019s civil aviation authority the day after the crash found that the pilots of the doomed plane did not make radio contact but had attempted to turn back to the airport before the plane went down. Experts raised serious concerns over the handling of the crash site, such as over the removal of debris, prompting fears that Tehran had sought to eliminate evidence from the area. Iran has invited investigators from Canada and Ukraine and from Boeing to visit the crash site on the outskirts of Tehran and said it would also welcome representatives of other countries whose citizens were killed. The plane, en route to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, was carrying 167 passengers and nine crew members from several countries, including 82 Iranians, at least 57 Canadians, 11 Ukrainians and three Britons. Iran had said on Thursday it would download information from voice and flight data recorders, known as black boxes, to determine what had happened, although it said the process could take up to two months.

Many considered Suleimani to have been the second most powerful person in Iran, behind supreme leader of Iran Ali Khamenei, but arguably ahead of President Hassan Rouhani. He was commander of the Quds Force, the elite, external wing of the Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which the Trump administration designated as a terror organisation in April last year.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>He was born in Rabor, a city in eastern Iran, and forced to travel to a neighbouring city at age 13 and work to pay his father\u2019s debts to the government of the Shah. By the time the monarch fell in 1979, Suleimani was committed to the clerical rule of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and joined the Revolutionary Guards, the paramilitary force established to prevent a coup against the newly declared Islamic Republic.</p>\n    <p>Within two years, he was sent to the front to fight in the war against the invading Iraqi army. He quickly distinguished himself, especially for daring reconnaissance missions behind Iraqi lines, and the war also gave him his first contact with foreign militias of the kind he would wield to devastating effect in the decades to come.</p>\n    <p>By the the time the Iraq government fell in 2003, Suleimani was the head of the Quds force and blamed for sponsoring the Shia militias who killed thousands of civilian Iraqis and coalition troops. As fighting raged on Iraq\u2019s streets, Suleimani fought a shadow war with the US for leverage over the new Iraqi leadership.</p>\n    <p>Once described by American commander David Petraeus as \u2018a truly evil figure\u2019, Suleimani was instrumental in crushing street protests in Iran in 2009. In recent months outbreaks of popular dissent in Lebanon, Iraq and Iran were again putting pressure on the crescent of influence he had spent the past two decades building. Violent crackdowns on the protests in Baghdad were blamed on militias under his influence.<br></p>\n    <p>Eighteen months before his death, Suleimani had issued Donald Trump a public warning, wagging his finger and dressed in olive fatigues. \u201cYou will start the war but we will end it.\u201d</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/michael-safi\"><b>Michael Safi</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Retaliation arrived in the shape of Iranian missiles <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/08/suleimani-assassination-two-us-airbases-in-iraq-hit-by-missiles-in-retaliation\">launched against US military bases</a> in Iraq.

He added that the black box and voice recordings would now be available to the experts, saying some media reporting about refusing to give others access to the box was based on unsubstantiated claims.</p> \n  <p>He insisted no Iranian missile was triggered at the time the Ukrainian plane was taking off from the airport around 6am, adding that Tehran\u2019s safety and security authorities were capable of distinguishing between a military and civilian aircraft. \u201cThe speed and height of a passenger airline is quite different from a missile or a fighter jet,\u201d he claimed. He said the Iranian radar could distinguish any threat in the air.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe plane was only 5 minutes in the air at 8,000 feet, and had requested permission to go to more than 20,000 feet. Our experts have announced that the plane was suffering a fire for more than a minute.\u201d </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-10T14:44:26.968Z\">at 2.44pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e187c6c8f08c397226482fc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-10T13:33:20.407Z\">1.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Tass news agency has reported that one of Russia\u2019s deputy foreign ministers, Sergei Ryabkov, said that Moscow had no grounds to blame Iran for the crash of a Ukrainian airliner near Tehran, contradicting statements by Canada\u2019s prime minister and others.</p> \n  <p>Ryabkov called on senior world officials to refrain from public statements until more details were known about the causes of the crash.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-10T14:35:18.468Z\">at 2.35pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e18798a8f08c397226482db\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-10T13:20:30.457Z\">1.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Germany\u2019s Lufthansa airline says it and subsidiaries are cancelling flights to and from Tehran for the next 10 days as a precautionary measure, the Associated Press is reporting.</p> \n  <p>The airline said the decision was due to the \u201cunclear security situation\u201d for the airspace around Tehran airport after the crash of Ukraine International Airlines flight 752.</p> \n  <p>Other airlines have been making changes to avoid Iranian airspace.

being followed closely in Germany. Three of the victims of the Ukraine airlines crash were German citizens, including Paniz Soltani, a 29-year-old scientist of Iranian-German citizenship, who worked at the Max Planck Institute in Mainz, and a 30-year-old woman of German-Afghan nationality and her children, eight and five, from the state of North Rhine Westphalia. </p> \n  <p>The national airline, Lufthansa, has cancelled all flights to and from Tehran until further notice. On Thursday night it ordered a plane from Frankfurt to Tehran to turn back as reports emerged that the crash had been caused by an Iranian missile. A spokeswoman for Lufthansa said: \u201cLufthansa flights from and to Teheran have been cancelled as a precaution.\u201d She did not say when the ban would be lifted.</p> \n  <p>The German government, keen to keep alive the fragile Iran nuclear deal framework, has been cautious not to be seen to support what is widely viewed in Germany as the Trump administration\u2019s belligerent and provocative approach towards Iran after the killing of Quassem Suleimani. But Heiko Mass, the German foreign minister, has said the death was hardly surprising given that Suleimani \u201chas drawn a trail of blood and violence throughout the Middle East\u201d. It was for that reason that he was on the EU\u2019s terrorist list, he said.</p> \n  <p>But critics in Germany who fear the government has taken a hitherto over-friendly stance towards Iran, have said the government should be looking closer to home, voicing concern over the influence of supporters loyal to the current Iranian regime living in Germany.<br></p> \n  <p>In particular, attention is being focused on a mosque in Hamburg where worshippers have been gathering in the past few days to publicly mourn the death of Suleimani. </p> \n  <p>The Imam Ali Mosque situated on the Alster river in the northern port city held a memorial service, as it stated: \u201cin honour of Suleimani and the nine additional victims\u201d of the US drone attack, last Sunday as well as holding subsequent events to mourn his passing. </p> \n  <p>Reporting on the services, Der Spiegel said that Hamburg\u2019s Social Democrat-Green coalition government has been urged by critics from the Christian Democrats, the pro-business FDP and the rightwing populist AfD, to cease its six-year state cooperation with the IZH, the Islamic Centre of Hamburg, which is responsible for the running of the mosque, amid concern over its growing political influence.</p> \n  <p>The public homage being paid to Suleimani, says Spiegel, \u201cis acting like dynamite in the debate about the correct way to deal with political Islam in Germany\u201d. But the Hamburg senate has said it has no plans to break the cooperation, which it claimed \u201coffers important chances for the development of the relationship between the city and the Islamic communities and as a whole for the better integration of Muslims\u201d. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-10T14:29:46.798Z\">at 2.29pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e185f8c8f085eda5c1157fc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-10T11:30:15.504Z\">11.30am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Elizabeth Palmer from CBS News has tweeted this picture of the crash site.

You can follow today\u2019s US reaction to the crash, including Trump\u2019s new sanctions against Iran in our US politics blog. Here\u2019s a summary of key events today. Thanks for following along. A UK expert raised serious concerns over the integrity of the crash site. Photographs taken the day of the crash showed heavy machinery being used to move larger pieces of debris. Graham Braithwaite said: \u201cWhere you have flight recorders that tell you what has happened you can move quickly to clearing the site. But if the recorders are damaged [as the Iranians have said] then all you have is the forensic evidence at the site to tell you the story.\u201d Hamid Baeidinejad, the Iranian ambassador to the UK, urged the west \u2013 including the UK \u2013 to stop politicising the inquiry into the Ukraine plane crash by rushing to premature judgment about its causes without hard evidence. Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister, Vadym Prystaiko, said he and the Ukrainian president had met US embassy officials and obtained important data about the plane crash. Earlier in the day, Volodomir Zelenskiy said he was not ruling out the possibility that the plane was shot down and again called for \u201call international partners\u201d the US, Britain and Canada in particular to share data and evidence relevant to the crash. French experts will play a role in the investigation into the Ukrainian International Airlines crash, officials said. Britain\u2019s ambassador to Iran said UK travel advice to Iran has changed and all British nationals are advised against all travel there. The advice adds: \u201cIf you\u2019re in Iran, you should review your departure options and consider leaving the country.\u201d Iranian officials have rejected western intelligence assessments that the Ukrainian airliner was shot down accidentally by an Iranian anti-aircraft missile. A spokesman for the Iranian government went on to blame what he described as a \u201cUS psychological operation\u201d. Graham Braithwaite, professor of safety and accident investigation at Cranfield University, has said the Iranian handling of the crash site, including the apparent quick removal of evidence, raised \u201cserious concerns over the integrity of the investigation\u201d. \u201cWhere you have flight recorders that tell you what has happened you can move quickly to clearing the site,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if the recorders are damaged [as the Iranians have said] then all you have is the forensic evidence at the site to tell you the story.\u201d Photographs taken the day of the crash showed heavy machinery being used to move larger pieces of debris. Iranian media outlets also published several photos and videos of the wide field of wreckage and personal belongings left by the crash. It was unclear whether the removal of the debris was done in accordance with crash-investigations procedures to ensure important evidence is preserved. Braithwaite, who teaches a course in air accident investigations, said he was surprised that the Iranians had moved to clear the crash site before other interested parties, including Ukrainian, Canadian and other technical investigators had been able to make their own examination, which he said he would have been expected under annex 13 of the Chicago convention, the international agreement that sets out protocols for crash inquiries. Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, met to discuss the plane crash this afternoon. A US statement said Pompeo offered the Ukrainian leader \u201ccondolences and full assistance in the ongoing investigation\u201d into the crash of the jetliner. Zelenskiy\u2019s office said he briefed Pompeo about the progress in the probe, and they agreed the US politician would visit Ukraine later this month. \u201cGrateful for the condolences of the American people and valuable support of the US in investigating the causes of the plane crash,\u201d Zelenskiy tweeted after the call. \u201cData from the United States contains important information to help with the investigation.\u201d Sweden\u2019s transport agency has temporarily halted Iran Air flights between Sweden and Iran after the crash of a Ukrainian airliner near Tehran. \u201cThe reason is the uncertainty around the accident and the security of civil aviation,\u201d the agency said in a statement reported by Reuters. Seven Swedish citizens and 17 people who lived in the country died in the crash. Iranian officials gave a press conference on Friday giving more details of their investigation and continuing to rebuff allegations the Ukrainian aircraft was shot down. \u201cIf [intelligence agencies] have findings with scientific support they should show this to the world,\u201d Ali Abedzadeh, the head of Iran\u2019s Civil Aviation Organisation, told reporters. He said he had watched a video clip purporting to show the plane being hit by a missile before crashing to the ground but said \u201cthis cannot be confirmed from a scientific perspective\u201d. He said the pilot had been in contact with the control tower two minutes before the accident, asking if he could ascend to 26,000 feet. After the fire broke out, the crew would have been consumed with \u201csaving the plane\u201d, he said, and so would not have been able to communicate further to explain what had gone wrong. \u201cWe have to look for the cause of the fire,\u201d Abedzadeh said. Hassan Rezaeifar, the head of the committee that oversees aviation accidents in Iran, said that contrary to earlier claims that the black boxes appeared to have been damaged by the crash, both appeared to be intact. \u201cWe prefer to extract the data and download the data inside the country,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if we come to the conclusion that the data may be damaged then we will carry out the process [overseas].\u201d Investigators would attempt to extract and analyse the black box data on Friday, he added, but said the findings might take one or two months to be released. Hamid Baeidinejad, the Iranian ambassador to the UK, has urged the west \u2013 including the UK \u2013 to stop politicising the inquiry into the Ukraine plane crash by rushing to premature judgment about its causes without hard evidence. He said such judgments merely caused pain for the families of the bereaved, including many Iranians. In an hour-long briefing, he also insisted that the Iranian government was allowing US government officials, as well as Boeing experts, to join the investigation in Tehran. He said: \u201cWe are fully committed to have a conclusive report on the reasons for the incident with experts on the ground from concerned countries.\u201d But he said he was \u201cdisappointed that some countries including the UK, which do not have hard evidence without access to the black box, the voice recordings, airplane wreckage and the technical engineers reports in Tehran airport, are rushing to judgment. That only adds to the anxiety of the families.\u201d He said it was not true that the crash site was being bulldozed, although the bodies, including Iranians, may be being collected from the site. Baeidinejad promised a full transparent and technical report, pointing out that Iran wanted to know the cause of the crash as much as any other country. He added that the black box and voice recordings would now be available to the experts, saying some media reporting about refusing to give others access to the box was based on unsubstantiated claims. He insisted no Iranian missile was triggered at the time the Ukrainian plane was taking off from the airport around 6am, adding that Tehran\u2019s safety and security authorities were capable of distinguishing between a military and civilian aircraft. \u201cThe speed and height of a passenger airline is quite different from a missile or a fighter jet,\u201d he claimed. He said the Iranian radar could distinguish any threat in the air. \u201cThe plane was only 5 minutes in the air at 8,000 feet, and had requested permission to go to more than 20,000 feet. Our experts have announced that the plane was suffering a fire for more than a minute.\u201d The Tass news agency has reported that one of Russia\u2019s deputy foreign ministers, Sergei Ryabkov, said that Moscow had no grounds to blame Iran for the crash of a Ukrainian airliner near Tehran, contradicting statements by Canada\u2019s prime minister and others. Ryabkov called on senior world officials to refrain from public statements until more details were known about the causes of the crash. Germany\u2019s Lufthansa airline says it and subsidiaries are cancelling flights to and from Tehran for the next 10 days as a precautionary measure, the Associated Press is reporting. The airline said the decision was due to the \u201cunclear security situation\u201d for the airspace around Tehran airport after the crash of Ukraine International Airlines flight 752. Other airlines have been making changes to avoid Iranian airspace. Alitalia, which hasn\u2019t had flights to Iran since December 2018, says its flights to New Delhi and the Maldives were using alternate routes to those that usually fly over Iran and Iraq. The investigative journalism website Bellingcat is responding to reports that the site of the plane crash is being cleared by bulldozers by compiling an interactive map of the scene, using pictures and videos shared online. Here\u2019s a useful visual guide to what we know about the crashing of Ukraine International Airlines flight 752: Boris Johnson has spoken to the Swedish prime minister Stefan L\u00f6fven and issued the following statement \u2013 The prime minister spoke to Prime Minister L\u00f6vfen of Sweden. The leaders expressed condolences to all those who lost loved ones on the Ukraine International Airlines flight \u2013 including from the UK and Sweden. They agreed that there must now be a full, transparent investigation and committed to work closely together and with other international partners to ensure the families of the victims get the answers they deserve. They also underlined the importance of the continued fight against the shared threat from Daesh [Isis] and urgent de-escalation in the region. Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister, Vadym Prystaiko, has said on Twitter that he and the Ukrainian president had met US embassy officials and obtained important data about the plane crash. Prystaiko gave no further details but said the data would be \u201cprocessed by our specialists\u201d. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, is due to discuss the investigation with Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, this afternoon. The Iran crisis is being followed closely in Germany. Three of the victims of the Ukraine airlines crash were German citizens, including Paniz Soltani, a 29-year-old scientist of Iranian-German citizenship, who worked at the Max Planck Institute in Mainz, and a 30-year-old woman of German-Afghan nationality and her children, eight and five, from the state of North Rhine Westphalia. The national airline, Lufthansa, has cancelled all flights to and from Tehran until further notice. On Thursday night it ordered a plane from Frankfurt to Tehran to turn back as reports emerged that the crash had been caused by an Iranian missile. A spokeswoman for Lufthansa said: \u201cLufthansa flights from and to Teheran have been cancelled as a precaution.\u201d She did not say when the ban would be lifted. The German government, keen to keep alive the fragile Iran nuclear deal framework, has been cautious not to be seen to support what is widely viewed in Germany as the Trump administration\u2019s belligerent and provocative approach towards Iran after the killing of Quassem Suleimani. But Heiko Mass, the German foreign minister, has said the death was hardly surprising given that Suleimani \u201chas drawn a trail of blood and violence throughout the Middle East\u201d. It was for that reason that he was on the EU\u2019s terrorist list, he said. But critics in Germany who fear the government has taken a hitherto over-friendly stance towards Iran, have said the government should be looking closer to home, voicing concern over the influence of supporters loyal to the current Iranian regime living in Germany. In particular, attention is being focused on a mosque in Hamburg where worshippers have been gathering in the past few days to publicly mourn the death of Suleimani. The Imam Ali Mosque situated on the Alster river in the northern port city held a memorial service, as it stated: \u201cin honour of Suleimani and the nine additional victims\u201d of the US drone attack, last Sunday as well as holding subsequent events to mourn his passing. Reporting on the services, Der Spiegel said that Hamburg\u2019s Social Democrat-Green coalition government has been urged by critics from the Christian Democrats, the pro-business FDP and the rightwing populist AfD, to cease its six-year state cooperation with the IZH, the Islamic Centre of Hamburg, which is responsible for the running of the mosque, amid concern over its growing political influence. The public homage being paid to Suleimani, says Spiegel, \u201cis acting like dynamite in the debate about the correct way to deal with political Islam in Germany\u201d. But the Hamburg senate has said it has no plans to break the cooperation, which it claimed \u201coffers important chances for the development of the relationship between the city and the Islamic communities and as a whole for the better integration of Muslims\u201d. Elizabeth Palmer from CBS News has tweeted this picture of the crash site. She says most of the wreckage has been cleared away and there is no security at the site. Hamed Esmaeilion, whose wife and daughter were killed in the Iran plane crash (see this earlier post), has shared this video of 9-year-old Reera Esmaeilion playing the piano. The head of Iran\u2019s civil aviation body has told reporters that authorities are examining the contents of flight 752\u2019s black box today at a laboratory at Tehran\u2019s Mehrabad airport. The will attempt to assess whether it is possible to reconstruct and analyse the information inside the country, according to Iran\u2019s Irna news agency. A British-Iranian woman jailed in Iran has had panic attacks since tensions between the country and the US escalated, her husband has said. Richard Ratcliffe said the fallout from Donald Trump\u2019s assassination of the Iranian general Qassem Suleimani was taking a toll on the mental health of his wife, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe. Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been detained since 2016 after she was arrested on espionage charges and jailed for five years. She is among up to five people with dual British-Iranian nationality, or with UK connections, believed to be in prison in Iran. Their families have said they are being held as collateral and that the heightened tensions have made it harder to secure their release. Iraq\u2019s top Shia Muslim cleric has condemned mutual US and Iranian attacks on Iraqi soil and warned of deteriorating security in the country and wider region as a result of Washington\u2019s standoff with Tehran. Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani said the attacks were a violation of sovereignty and that no foreign powers should be allowed to decide Iraq\u2019s fate. Sistani delivered his message through a representative who spoke at Friday prayer in the holy city of Kerbala, Reuters reported. \u201cThe use of over-the-top methods by different sides which possess power and influence ... will only entrench the crisis and prevent a solution,\u201d the representative said. \u201cThe latest dangerous aggressive acts, which are repeated violations of Iraqi sovereignty, are a part of the deteriorating situation [in the region].\u201d Canada is \u201cpaying for past decisions\u201d \u2013 namely a decision by Canada\u2019s previous Conservative administration to sever ties with Tehran and upheld by Justin Trudeau\u2019s government \u2013 asserts a piece in the Toronto Star. Like other news outlets in Canada, which was the end destination of 138 people on the Ukraine International Airlines flight, the Star leads with developments including the news that Canada\u2019s federal transportation safety agency has accepted an invitation from Iran to send officials to the site. But the newspaper adds that without an official relationship, Canada must rely on Italy to secure applications and coordinate diplomacy with Tehran. The perception that the threat of war in the middle east has receded caused oil to slip towards $65 a barrel today as investors also focused on rising US inventories. Crude is now below where it was before a U.S. drone strike killed Iranian general Qassem Suleimani on 3 January. For more on that, my colleague Kalyeena Makortoff is running a business liveblog here. France\u2019s BEA air accident agency has said it would be involved in the investigation into a Ukrainian airliner crash in Iran. \u201cWe have been notified of the event by Iran and we have designated an accredited representative to the safety investigation,\u201d a BEA spokesman said. \u201cNo further assistance has been requested at this point in time,\u201d he added. Airstrikes carried out by unidentified planes in the Syrian province of Deir Ezzor overnight killed at least eight members of an Iranian-backed militia, according to monitors. Several planes targeted positions belonging to the Iraqi Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary group in Bukamal, near the border with Iraq, in the early hours of Friday, both local media and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The attack, which occurs against the backdrop of soaring tensions across the region between the US and Iran, was most likely carried out by Israel, Iraqi officials said, without offering evidence. Israel regularly carries out airstrikes inside Syria targeting Iranian assets but does not normally comment on its military activity in the neighbouring nine-year-old civil war. The same area was also targeted by the US on 29 December in strikes which killed 25 members of a pro-Iran Iraqi militia Kataib Hezbollah in retaliation for a rocket attack on a military base in Iraq that killed a US military contractor as tensions escalated between Washington and Tehran over the last two weeks. Weapons depots and vehicles were targeted, causing several huge explosions, the UK-based Observatory said. Deir Ezzor 24 and Sound and Pictures, activist collectives in the area, also said the planes had struck trucks carrying weapons and depots for ballistic missiles near the town. The area struck Friday is a key land corridor for Tehran that links Iran across Iraq and Syria through Lebanon. Britain\u2019s ambassador to Iran has been on Twitter pointing out that UK travel advice to Iran has changed and all British nationals are advised against all travel there. The advice adds: \u201cIf you\u2019re in Iran, you should review your departure options and consider leaving the country.\u201d In Germany, Lufthansa has confirmed that one of its flight to Tehran was ordered yesterday to turn back to Germany, amid security concerns, after the emergence of the missile attack allegations. It followed the airline\u2019s lifting of a flight ban to Tehran-bound aircraft, after one day. Iran continues to deny the assessments of western intelligence agencies that its force shot down the Ukrainian passenger jet in the tense early hours on Wednesday morning. Ali Abedzadeh, the head of Iran\u2019s Civil Aviation Organisation, said overnight: \u201cAt the time this plane was in the air, there were several other internal and international flights flying at 8000 feet and the suggestion it was targeted by a missile cannot be correct.\u201d Flight records show there was some domestic traffic around the same time at the Mehrabad Airport, about 35km north-east of Imam Khomeini International airport. Flight records available online show there were no other flights landing or taking off from Imam Khomeini International airport around the same as the Ukrainian plane was in flight. Hassan Rezaeifar, the head of the committee that oversees aviation accidents in Iran, said \u201cnowhere in the world\u201d would it be possible to determine the cause of a crash this soon. \u201cNot only haven\u2019t we found evidence to prove the claim [of a missile strike] but we\u2019ve found evidence to reject it,\u201d he said, likely referring to claims by Iranian investigators that the Ukrainian flight attempted to turn around and return to the airport before it went down. He said he was open to international involvement in the probe, including American, but added - likely in reference to sanctions that prevent US involvement with Iran - that they \u201cshould get the authority from their Senate\u201d. The terrible human tragedy at the centre of the incident is laid bare in reports which are detailing how the flight was carrying entire families, university students, and a young couple who had traveled back to Iran for their wedding. Arash Pourzarabi, 26, and Pouneh Gourji, 25, who were graduate students in computer science at the University of Alberta, had gone to Iran for their wedding, according to Reza Akbari, president of the Iranian Heritage Society of Edmonton. They were on the plane with four members of their wedding party and 24 other Iranian-Canadians from Edmonton, Akbari said. \u201cOh God, I can\u2019t believe this,\u201d Akbari told Reuters. \u201cIt\u2019s shocking to the whole community.\u201d Borna Ghotbi, a close friend of the newlyweds since they were all undergraduates at Tehran\u2019s Sharif University, said their wedding took place three days ago. Another couple, Siavash Ghafouri Azar and Sara Mamani, had also just married in Iran, according to a Montreal university professor who taught Azar. The couple, both engineers, had just bought a house in a Montreal suburb. Negar Mortazavi, Iranian-American journalist, has tweeted this interview with Hamed Esmaeilion, whose wife Parisa and their daughter Reera were killed in the crash. France has said this morning that it is ready to join the investigating into the crash of a Ukrainian airliner. \u201cIt is important that as much clarity as possible is made and as quickly as possible,\u201d French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian was quoted by Reuters as saying. Last year, the French agency BEA helped analyse data from the flight recorder of a crashed Boeing plane in Ethiopia. In a Facebook post this morning the Ukrainian president says he is not ruling out the possibility that the plane which crashed earlier this week in Iran had been hit a by a missile. \u201cThe missile theory is not ruled out, but it has not been confirmed yet,\u201d Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in the post. Zelenskiy reiterated his call for \u201call international partners\u201d the U.S., Britain and Canada in particular to share data and evidence relevant to the crash. The head of Iran\u2019s investigation team into the plane crash has told state television that Tehran will use expert help from Russia, Ukraine, France and Canada if we cannot recover data from the plane\u2019s recorders. Hassan Rezaeifar said today that recovering the data could take more than one month and the entire investigation into the crash could take more than one year. He also said the flight had been delayed by about an hour because the pilot decided to unload part of the luggage as the flight was overweight. It\u2019s believed the US system that detected the missile launches that brought down the Ukrainian passenger jet is the Space Based Infrared System, a network of around ten satellites operated by the US Air Force\u2019s Space Command first launched in 2011. The Guardian\u2019s Peter Beaumont adds that the system was designed specifically to detect launches of missiles, including missile tests by countries like North Korea, and relies on detecting the infrared end of the spectrum. Specifically the system is designed to be able to detect strategic and short range ballistic missile launches, determine their flight trajectory, and provide a location for where the missile will hit, pretty much what the US and its allies are claiming. Oleksandr Danylyuk, the former head of Ukraine\u2019s national security and defence council, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that the US side should have enough intelligence in the region to be back up assertions that the flight was shot down. He added: \u201cIt looked very suspicious early. It was a relatively new plane with very experienced crew. What I was very suspicious about was that quite quickly from the Iranian side there was a position that it was not a terrorist attack or shooting down but a technical failure.\u201d The investigative journalism website Bellingcat has geolocated the location of one of a number of videos that have emerged showing the moment of a possible missile strike on the plane. The video - which posted onto a public Telegram channel - has been geolocated to a residential area in Parand (coordinates 35.489414, 50.906917), a suburb to the west of Imam Khomeini International Airport, according to the website. Bellingcat notes that it is unclear why the person holding the camera was filming at the time, but it was possible that there were two missiles. A number of media outlets report that Iran had turned on its missile defence system to protect itself after it fired 22 missiles at American bases in Iraq in retaliation for the US killing last week in Iraq of the Iranian general Qassem Suleimani. The system, however, mistook Flight 752 for a threat and shot it down, Newsweek reports, quoting a senior US intelligence official. US media outlets have also quoted officials saying their satellites had identified the signature of an Iranian anti-aircraft battery being activated shortly before the aircraft went down a few minutes after taking off at 6.13am on Wednesday morning. The US officials said they had identified infrared signals from two suspected missiles, followed shortly afterwards by an infrared blip from the burning aircraft. Public suspicions that the Boeing 737-800 may have accidentally been shot down had grown throughout Thursday based on images circulating on social media showing what appeared to be missile debris that was purportedly photographed near the crash site. Iranian officials have rejected the western intelligence assessments. \u201cScientifically, it is impossible that a missile hit the Ukrainian plane, and such rumours are illogical,\u201d said Ali Abedzadeh, the head of Iran\u2019s of Civil Aviation Organisation. A spokesman for the Iranian government, Ali Rabiei, went on in a statement today to blame what he described as a \u201cUS psychological operation.\u201d Iran\u2019s Press TV quotes him as saying: \u201cIt is unfortunate that the psychological operation of the US government, and those supporting it knowingly and unknowingly, are adding insult to the injury of the bereaved families and victimising them for certain goals by propagating such fallacies,\u201d the senior Iranian official pointed out. Meanwhile, a new video has emerged which appears to show the moment a Ukrainian passenger jet was shot down in Iran. Originally obtained by the New York Times, the phone footage shows a tiny spec suddenly exploding. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has vowed to find answers over crash that killed 176 people, including 63 Canadians, and has also cited intelligence reports casting the incident in a new light. \u201cWe have intelligence, including from our allies and own intelligence that the plane was shot down by Iranian surface-to-air missiles,\u201d Trudeau said. \u201cCanadians want answers. That means transparency, accountability and justice.\u201d Western agencies are understood to have picked up signals of the missile launches followed by the traces of an explosion. A British source told the Guardian: \u201cThe assessment is that it looks like it is a tragic accident.\u201d In a statement on Thursday night, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \u201cThere is now a body of information that the flight was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile. This may well have been unintentional. We are working closely with Canada and our international partners and there now needs to be a full, transparent investigation.\u201d Good morning and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live blog coverage of the terrible loss of life after a Ukrainian passenger aircraft crashed shortly after taking off from Tehran - and the new development in the form of claims by western security officials that it was accidentally shot down by an Iranian anti-aircraft missile. Intelligence have sources told the Guardian their assessments suggest two surface-to-air missiles had targeted the Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 that went down in Iran on Wednesday morning, killing all 176 people onboard. Iran was inviting experts from Boeing, the jetliner\u2019s manufacturer, to join the investigation into the crash, the Iranian official news agency IRNA said on Friday, while the US National Transportation Safety Board said it had received \u201cformal notification\u201d of the crash from Iran and had designated a representative to the crash inquiry. On Friday morning the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy called on \u201cinternational partners\u201d to share any information they had on the crash. Zelenskiy also said he would discuss the investigation with US secretary of state Mike Pompeo later on Friday. \u201cThe version about a missile hitting a plane is not ruled out, but it has not been confirmed yet,\u201d Zelenskiy said on Facebook. \u201cGiven the recent statements by the leaders of the states in the media, we call on all international partners - notably the governments of the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom - to submit data and evidence concerning the disaster to the commission which investigates the causes.\u201d You can reach here here on Twitter if you want to flag up news developments on this.",

Intelligence sources have told the Guardian that it appeared two surface-to-air missiles targeted Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752, killing all 176 people onboard.</p> \n<p>US officials told media that satellites picked up an anti-aircraft missile battery switching on, followed by infrared signals from two suspected missiles, then an infrared blip from the burning aircraft. Of the 176 people onboard, 78 were Iranian, 63 were Canadian and 11 were Ukrainian along with 10 Swedes, seven Afghans, four Britons and three German nationals. The Canadian PM, Justin Trudeau, said: \u201cWe have intelligence, including from our allies and own intelligence, that the plane was shot down by Iranian surface-to-air missiles. Canadians want answers. That means transparency, accountability and justice.\u201d</p> \n<p>Iranian officials on Thursday rejected the western intelligence assessments and said it was \u201cscientifically\u201d impossible for the plane to have been hit by one of their missiles. Boris Johnson said the shooting down \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/09/johnson-backs-missile-theory-in-tehran-plane-crash-as-uk-toll-rises\">may well have been unintentional.</a> We are working closely with Canada and our international partners and there now needs to be a full, transparent investigation.\u201d In the US, the House of Representatives has voted to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/09/house-war-powers-trump-iran\">curb Trump\u2019s power to make war against Iran</a>, though the resolution is not binding. A short time ago Trump spoke at a rally in Toledo where he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/10/killing-iran-general-suleimani-american-justice-donald-trump-ohio-rally\">unapologetic about the killing of Suleimani</a>, who he said was planning attacks on US interests. \u201cWe stopped him and we stopped him quickly and we stopped him cold.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"30accade-e85c-40f7-9f19-22f88db3001a\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mzP4O61doNM?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Police plea to ban burners \u2013 </strong>Anonymous pay-as-you-go mobile phones should be banned to help tackle county lines drug dealers, Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate of Constabulary has recommended.

The report said school exclusions expose children to being recruited into county lines gangs \u2013 but HMIC\u2019s chief inspector, Sir Tom Winsor, said social workers were dealing with enormous caseloads without enough resources for services to protect the vulnerable. \u201cChildren\u2019s services are under extraordinary strain,\u201d he said.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>MoD not deterred from Trident waste \u2013 </strong>The cost of maintaining three British nuclear sites <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/10/mod-blunders-caused-spiralling-trident-costs-nuclear-sites\">spiralled by \u00a31.35bn</a> because of poor management by the Ministry of Defence (MoD), Whitehall\u2019s watchdog has found. The National Audit Office also said work to build and maintain the UK\u2019s Trident nuclear deterrent in Cumbria, Derbyshire and Berkshire will be completed more than six years later than planned. Civil servants rely on the work of three monopolistic suppliers \u2013 the Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE), Rolls-Royce and BAE Systems \u2013 which means contracts cannot be terminated for poor performance. Auditors found three programmes \u2013 a new nuclear warhead plant, a nuclear core plant and shipyard work \u2013 were valued at \u00a32.5bn but found costs ballooned and delays ran at between 1.7 and 6.3 years. The MoD was continuing to repeat mistakes made in the last cycle of investment in the nuclear enterprise in the 1980s and 1990s, the report found.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Grassy slopes of Everest \u2013 </strong>Shrubs and grasses are springing up around Mount Everest and across the Himalayas, one of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/10/grass-growing-around-mount-everest-as-global-heating-intensifies\">most rapidly heating regions of the planet</a>.

          "bodyText": "Top story: \u2018Transparency, accountability and justice\u2019 Hello, Warren Murray here, welcome to the round-up. The revelation that Iranian forces may have shot down the Boeing 737 airliner that crashed on Wednesday is prompting a reassessment of the consequences of Donald Trump\u2019s decision to assassinate the Iranian general Qassem Suleimani. Intelligence sources have told the Guardian that it appeared two surface-to-air missiles targeted Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752, killing all 176 people onboard. US officials told media that satellites picked up an anti-aircraft missile battery switching on, followed by infrared signals from two suspected missiles, then an infrared blip from the burning aircraft. Of the 176 people onboard, 78 were Iranian, 63 were Canadian and 11 were Ukrainian along with 10 Swedes, seven Afghans, four Britons and three German nationals. The Canadian PM, Justin Trudeau, said: \u201cWe have intelligence, including from our allies and own intelligence, that the plane was shot down by Iranian surface-to-air missiles. Canadians want answers. That means transparency, accountability and justice.\u201d Iranian officials on Thursday rejected the western intelligence assessments and said it was \u201cscientifically\u201d impossible for the plane to have been hit by one of their missiles. Boris Johnson said the shooting down \u201cmay well have been unintentional. We are working closely with Canada and our international partners and there now needs to be a full, transparent investigation.\u201d In the US, the House of Representatives has voted to curb Trump\u2019s power to make war against Iran, though the resolution is not binding. A short time ago Trump spoke at a rally in Toledo where he was unapologetic about the killing of Suleimani, who he said was planning attacks on US interests. \u201cWe stopped him and we stopped him quickly and we stopped him cold.\u201d * * * Police plea to ban burners \u2013 Anonymous pay-as-you-go mobile phones should be banned to help tackle county lines drug dealers, Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate of Constabulary has recommended. The police inspectorate says the gangs use phones extensively and are able buy phones or sim cards without needing to prove their identity, despite police being able to order telephone companies to cut them off. \u201cWe were told of one example where a county lines network received and shared a new number within an hour of the service provider acting on the order,\u201d said the inspectorate in a report. The report said school exclusions expose children to being recruited into county lines gangs \u2013 but HMIC\u2019s chief inspector, Sir Tom Winsor, said social workers were dealing with enormous caseloads without enough resources for services to protect the vulnerable. \u201cChildren\u2019s services are under extraordinary strain,\u201d he said. * * * MoD not deterred from Trident waste \u2013 The cost of maintaining three British nuclear sites spiralled by \u00a31.35bn because of poor management by the Ministry of Defence (MoD), Whitehall\u2019s watchdog has found. The National Audit Office also said work to build and maintain the UK\u2019s Trident nuclear deterrent in Cumbria, Derbyshire and Berkshire will be completed more than six years later than planned. Civil servants rely on the work of three monopolistic suppliers \u2013 the Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE), Rolls-Royce and BAE Systems \u2013 which means contracts cannot be terminated for poor performance. Auditors found three programmes \u2013 a new nuclear warhead plant, a nuclear core plant and shipyard work \u2013 were valued at \u00a32.5bn but found costs ballooned and delays ran at between 1.7 and 6.3 years. The MoD was continuing to repeat mistakes made in the last cycle of investment in the nuclear enterprise in the 1980s and 1990s, the report found. * * * Grassy slopes of Everest \u2013 Shrubs and grasses are springing up around Mount Everest and across the Himalayas, one of the most rapidly heating regions of the planet. The melting of Himalayan glaciers has doubled since the turn of the century. Studying images from 1993 to 2018 provided by Nasa\u2019s Landsat satellites, researchers from Exeter University measured the spread of vegetation in the \u201csubnival\u201d region, between the snowline and the treeline. There are fears it could lead to increased flooding in the vast Hindu Kush Himalayan region, as plants absorb more light and heat, and this warms the soil, leading to greater water run-off. \u201cThat would be bad news for the Himalayas,\u201d said Dr Karen Anderson from Exeter University. \u201cThe subnival zone is where seasonal snow is held and if it is warmer you will get flashy hydrology \u2013 quicker melt rates and an increased risk of flooding.\u201d * * * Maximum fine over Dixons hack \u2013 Dixons Carphone has been hit with the largest possible fine of \u00a3500,000 after \u201csystemic failures\u201d in its cybersecurity allowed a hack that affected millions of customers. An attacker installed malicious software on 5,390 tills in branches of its Currys PC World and Dixons Travel chains. The hack harvested payment card details of 5.6 million people as well as personal information from about 14 million, said data watchdog the ICO. Dixons Carphone has said it is considering appealing against the fine and argues there is \u201cno confirmed evidence of any customers suffering fraud or financial loss as a result\u201d. * * * \u2018Engaging and humanistic\u2019 \u2013 John le Carr\u00e9 has been named this morning as the latest recipient of the $100,000 (\u00a376,000) Olof Palme prize, an award given for an \u201coutstanding achievement\u201d in the spirit of the assassinated Swedish prime minister. Prize organisers praised the 88-year-old author, whose real name is David Cornwell, \u201cfor his engaging and humanistic opinion-making in literary form regarding the freedom of the individual and the fundamental issues of mankind\u201d. The acclaimed author of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy and The Spy Who Came in from the Cold has been outspoken about abuses of power, his targets including governments, big pharma and arms dealing. Agent Running in the Field, his most recent book \u2013 which he has hinted will be his last \u2013 depicts collusion between Donald Trump\u2019s US and the British security services with the aim of undermining the European Union. Le Carr\u00e9 said he would donate the winnings to M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res. * * * In case you missed it \u2013 What with everything else going on \u2026 the Brexit withdrawal agreement bill has passed the Commons and is in the hands of the House of Lords. Peers are unlikely to block it, which means the UK is on track to leave the EU on 31 January. Downing Street has stressed that it is ready to begin the next stage of the Brexit process \u2013 negotiating a trade deal by the end of the year \u2013 on 1 February. Today in Focus podcast: The Ayia Napa rape case On 17 July 2019 an 18-year old British woman claimed she had been gang-raped by a group of Israeli tourists. Ten days later she was being charged with lying by the Cypriot police. Michael Polak, her lawyer, discusses the case, while Israeli journalist Noa Shpigel describes covering the story. And: Caroline Davies discusses the Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u2019s decision to step back. Lunchtime read: Gary Younge\u2019s last Guardian column Gary Younge is leaving the Guardian after 26 years to become a sociology professor with Manchester University. \u201cIn my interview for a Guardian Scott Trust bursary to study a postgraduate course in journalism, I was asked what kind of job I would aspire to if I ever got to work at the paper. \u2018A columnist, like Hugo Young,\u2019 I said. \u2018There\u2019s only room for a handful of columnists on a newspaper,\u2019 I was told. \u2018And why shouldn\u2019t one of them be me?\u2019 I asked.\u201d \u201cThe bursary I was awarded emerged in the early 1990s and was a response to the uprisings among black youth in the 80s. Black people were always in the news, but rarely in the newsrooms. The Scott Trust, which owns the Guardian, wanted to offer a correction and so gave bursaries to under-represented groups in journalism. Without it I would have chosen another profession \u2026 \u2018Ingratitude\u2019 is the accusation launched by racists at black people in the public eye who have the audacity to highlight the racial injustice they see and have experienced. So I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to the youth who took to the streets, and bereaved families who took to the courts, to make my career possible.\u201d Sport Andrew Strauss has insisted there must be an overwhelming case for the proposed switch to four-day Test cricket or it should not occur. Dan Evans\u2019s ATP Cup victory over Australia\u2019s Alex de Minaur proved in vain but the Great Britain coach, Tim Henman, has said the Briton\u2019s performances \u201cwere a huge positive\u201d as the Australian Open looms. Lewis Hamilton contributed $500,000 in an auction for Shane Warne\u2019s baggy green, which fetched $1m to aid those affected by Australia\u2019s bushfires. Red Bull\u2019s Max Verstappen would have been in line to replace Hamilton at Mercedes if the champion moves to Ferrari but instead the Dutchman may be the man who keeps Honda in Formula 1. Harry Kane will undergo surgery to repair the damage to his hamstring and has been ruled out by Tottenham until April. Sir Mo Farah has claimed he would have been the \u201cfirst one out\u201d of the Nike Oregon Project if he had known about Alberto Salazar\u2019s dubious practices \u2013 despite sticking with his former coach for two years after serious allegations were made against him in 2015. And Magnus Carlsen became No 1 in fantasy football during a highly successful year and the chess world champion now has his sights set on a record unbeaten streak in chess. Business Asian shares have risen with worries receding of war between the United States and Iran. Japan\u2019s benchmark Nikkei 225 edged up 0.2% in morning trading while gains were also recorded by the S&amp;P/ASX 200 in South Korea\u2019s Kospi and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng. The Shanghai Composite fell. On Wall Street money flowed into riskier investments, such as technology stocks, and trickled out of traditional havens such as gold. The pound is worth $1.308 and \u20ac1.178. The FTSE is trending higher by around 30 points ahead of the open.

          "bodyText": "On 6 January, Alvand Sadeghi was due to fly from Tehran back to Toronto. But a rapidly deteriorating political situation in the region left the web designer with a cancelled flight. Eager to return, the 29-year-old booked a new flight two days later, on Ukrainian International Airlines flight PS752. He was travelling with his wife, sister and eight-year-old niece. Shortly after takeoff, however, the plane was in trouble \u2013 hit, it is now suspected, by an Iranian surface-to-air missile. \u201cIt\u2019s just crazy how destiny works to steal the greatest,\u201d said Patty De Frutos, a co-worker of Sadeghi. \u201cWe all know he was the best out of all of us.\u201d Hundreds of Toronto residents gathered throughout the city on Thursday evening for candlelight vigils commemorating the 176 victims of the crash, most of whom were travelling onward to Canada. In northern Toronto \u2013 a section of the city with a large Iranian population dubbed \u201cTehranto\u201d \u2013 large crowds gathered in the cold beside a makeshift memorial. \u201cWe have no words yet,\u201d De Frutos said as she and friends of Sadeghi prepared to lay bouquets in tribute to their friend. \u201cBut we\u2019ll probably never have the words. He was truly a pure soul.\u201d As the crowd grew in size, Pajman Loghmani stood at the outer fringes, waiting for his son. In his gloved hands, he held Canadian and Iranian flags. \u201cI\u2019m proud to have been Canadian for the last 13 years, but I keep my roots,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I teach my boys to know where they live, but also where they\u2019re from.\u201d Loghmani\u2019s friend Hamed Esmaeilion, a dentist, lost his wife, Parisa Eghbalian, and daughter Reera on the flight. \u201cI haven\u2019t had the chance to call him \u2013 I want to respect his privacy,\u201d Loghmani said. \u201cBut it\u2019s absolutely heartbreaking. Putting myself in the shoes of those who have lost someone - it\u2019s unimaginable.\u201d Stories of the victims\u2019 lives continue to emerge \u2013 the lives of doctors, engineers, students, parents and friends. The former Ontario premier Kathleen Wynne told those at the vigil that the stories highlighted the widespread and deep influence many of the Iranian diaspora had throughout Canada. The Toronto mayor, John Tory, called it a \u201ctragedy\u201d, telling the Iranian community the city stood in solidarity with those affected. In a nearby civic centre, hundreds more gathered to lay flowers and candles for the victims. Following a statement by the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, earlier in the afternoon that multiple intelligence reports pointed to a missile bringing down the plane, the vigils took on a new dimension. \u201cWe want justice! We want justice!\u201d the crowd shouted at one point. Later on, the crowd began jeering the Iranian government. \u201cDeath to the Islamic regime!\u201d a number of people shouted. Minor scuffles between pro- and anti-regime people broke out at both the square and inside the civic centre, with police removing a handful of people from the building. But for most part the focus was on paying tribute to members of the community whose absence is being felt deeply. A week before she left for Iran, architect Mahdieh Ghassem learned she had won a commission to design a Tim Hortons cafe. Her two young children, Arnica and Arsan, were in the gifted program at school, said friend Yalda Norouzi. \u201cShe was a very kind mom. She worked to achieve everything for them,\u201d Norouzi said, choking back tears. \u201cShe was so kind. By coming here tonight they will stay alive in our hearts forever.\u201d Norouzi carried a bag of white candles. Her husband held a framed photograph of Ghassemi and her children and laid it at the memorial. \u201cToronto is the most multicultural place,\u201d Norouzi said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter which country you\u2019re from \u2013 you\u2019re human, you are Canadian. They were members of Canada and this loss is for this country, not just Iran.\u201d",

          "bodyText": "Live political reporting continues in Friday\u2019s blog: The House voted to limit Donald Trump\u2019s war powers. The measure compels the president to consult Congress before taking further action against Iran. As a \u201cconcurrent resolution\u201d, the legislation doesn\u2019t need to be ratified by Trump, but is not legally binding. Still, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi insisted the War Powers Resolution \u201chas real teeth\u201d because \u201cit is a statement of the Congress of the United States\u201d. At a rally in Ohio (which is still ondoing), Trump repeated a claim that he ordered a strike on Iranian general Quassem Suleimani because of a threat to the US embassy in Baghdad. The president also derided Congress\u2019 War Powers resolution and implied it would have been impractical to coordinate schedules with lawmakers to discuss the strike before he ordered it. Pelosi said she won\u2019t publicly set a deadline to send the articles of impeachment against Trump to the Senate, though Senate Leader Mitch McConnell reportedly expects them as early as tomorrow. Western officials believe the Ukrainian airliner that crashed shortly after taking off from Tehran on Wednesday was caused by an Iranian missile. OF the 176 passengers who died, 63 were Canadian. Canada\u2019s prime minister Justin Trudeau said his government \u201cwill not rest\u201d until it got justice. LA mayor Eric Garcetti has endorsed Joe Biden Joe Biden gained a high-profile supporter in Calfornia, ahead of the state\u2019s March 3 primary. The Los Angeles mayor joined Dianne Feinstein, the state\u2019s senior US senator, in endorsing Biden. \u201cWe need Joe Biden to bring our nation and world together during these most divided and dangerous times,\u201d Garcetti said in a statement. Although Biden is a front-runner in national polls, in California, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are neck and neck with the former vice president. Garcetti weighed entering the 2020 race himself but announced a year ago that he wouldn\u2019t be running. The president is now addressing his order to kill Iranian general Qassem Suleimani without consulting Congress. Trump said he\u2019s ended Suleimani\u2019s \u201crampage though not only that part of the world\u201d but also \u201cother parts\u201d, implying that Suleimani was targeting the US embassy in Baghdad and other embassies. \u201cHe\u2019s no longer a terror \u2014 he\u2019s dead,\u201d Trump said. He derided \u201cCrazy Bernie\u201d and Nancy Pelosi for criticizing his moves against Iran, and mocked Democrats who passed a War Powers Resolutions to prevent him from taking further action without consulting Congress, implying it would have been too difficult to coordinate schedules to discuss the \u201cexecution\u201d of the Iranian general before ordering it. Earlier today, Trump claimed he ordered the killing of Suleimani to stop a plot to destroy the US embassy in Baghdad, though he didn\u2019t provide any further details to reporters. The plot was \u201cobvious,\u201d he said, pointing to protesters who stormed the U.S. embassy in Baghdad. Democratic and Republican lawmakers have criticized the Trump administration\u2019s refusal to provide more information on why, exactly, the Iranian general was targeted now. Donald Trump is speaking at a rally in Toledo, Ohio. An Ohio politics reporter fact-checks his claim that \u201cOhio just had the best year economically\u201d. Billionaire Tom Steyer is the sixth candidate to qualify for the Democratic debate Steyer qualified for the debate after two Fox News polls released today showed Steyer polling double-digits in South Carolina and Nevada. He tied alongside Sen. Elizabeth Warren for third place in Nevada and landed in second place in South Carolina, with at 15%. Joe Biden took the lead spot in both polls. The debate is scheduled for Jan 14 in Des Moines, Iowa. Along with Steyer, Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg, and Amy Klobuchar have also qualified. Cory Booker, Deval Patrick and Andrew Yang, the three remaining candidates of color have not yet qualified; they have through tomorrow to do so. This post was amended on 10 January 2020. A previous version omitted Deval Patrick from the list of candidates of color. Having approved the war powers resolution, the House has now moved on to environmental policy. Members are debating legislation that would require the Environmental Protection Agency to designate per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances as hazardous. But Donald Trump \u2013 who today unveiled a plan to bypass environmental review of major infrastructure projects and has aggressively pursued cuts to environmental projection \u2013 insists he cares about the environment, too. Asked whether climate change was a hoax this morning, Trump told reporters \u201cit\u2019s a very serious subject\u201d and he\u2019s going to read a book about it. The New York Times\u2019 Lisa Friedman followed up \u2013 and discovered the title of the book he intends to read: Donald J Trump: An Environmental Hero, by Ed Russo. The book was self-published by Russo, who was an environmental advisor for the Trump Organization. A Super Pac set up to help defeat the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, is releasing its first attack ad against the top Kentucky Republican. The 46-second web ad by the \u201cFire Mitch. Save America\u201d Super Pac is a compilation of clips of late night hosts lambasting McConnell. It starts with Daily Show comedian Trevor Noah saying McConnell is \u201ctruly the perfect movie villain\u201d while images of McConnell on the Senate floor and smiling directly into the camera. The ad shows a clip of comedian Samantha Bee saying \u201cMcConnell is so good at blocking things he\u2019s like the kidney stone of the Senate.\u201d Thr MSNBC host Joe Scarborough\u2019s voice then says \u201ckeeps killing any bill that would protect American democracy\u201d before going back to Bee saying McConnell has been \u201copenly bragging about he how he stole a supreme court seat\u201d \u2013 a reference to McConnell\u2019s refusal to hold hearings on Barack Obama\u2019s nomination of Merrick Garland for the supreme court. The ad then switches to a clip of McConnell saying \u201cthink of me as the grim reaper\u201d. The ad frames McConnell as a nefarious figure in the Senate, a common sentiment among Democrats. \u201cMitch McConnell is the most unpopular senator in the entire country and yet he has enormous power to block progress on so many issues important to all of our families,\u201d Democratic strategist Eric Hyers, the founder of the Super Pac, said in a statement. \u201cHe is fueling the cynicism and distrust of Washington and it\u2019s time for him to go. Kentucky and all Americans deserve better.\u201d The ad is the first one by the Super Pac and is set to air on multiple digital platforms. It\u2019s the latest example of Democrats\u2019 efforts to oust the longtime senator by painting him as a consummate Washington insider motivated by partisanship above all else. McConnell is up for re-election in 2020 and multiple Democrats are running in the primary for the party nomination to face him. But Democrat Amy McGrath, the former Democratic congressional candidate, is the heavy favorite. The Super Pac plans to produce more content against McConnell. The House resolution came about after Donald Trump chose to take unilateral action last week to assassinate the senior Iranian general Qassem Suleimani without consulting or even notifying before Congress. To stop the president from taking further action against Iran without consulting them, House Democrats have invoked the War Powers Act of 1973, which draws out the parameters of presidential and congressional war powers. With the passage of an Authorization for Use of Military Force in 2001 to fight terrorism, and another AUMF in 2002 for the war in Iraq, Congress\u2019 war powers have diminished since 9/11. Now many lawmakers \u2013 especially Democrats \u2013 are discussing how to rebalance war powers. In the Senate, a similar war powers proposal by Democrat Tim Kaine faces much slimmer odds of passing, though Republican Senator Todd Young, an ex-marine who represents Indiana, and two other Republicans indicated yesterday the would back the plan. Three Republicans voted for the resolution: Thomas Massie, Francis Rooney and Matt Gaetz. Eight Democrats voted against. This is a \u201cconcurrent resolution\u201d \u2013 which doesn\u2019t go to the president for a signature, and also isn\u2019t usually legally binding. However, House Democrats are arguing that a concurrent resolution under the War Powers Act is a special case, and is binding. The debate over the implications of this resolution has gotten a bit... catty. Voting mostly but not entirely along party lines, the House approved a resolution to limit the president\u2019s war powers, 224-194 The measure compels the president to go to Congress for authorization before taking further military action against Iran. As the House continues to debate a war powers resolution, Donald Trump is en route to Ohio, where he\u2019s holding a campaign rally later today. He\u2019s accompanied today by aides Dan Scavino, Kellyanne Conway and Stephen Miller. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Nancy Pelosi would not commit to a specific timeline on transmitting the articles of impeachment, only telling reporters at the House speaker\u2019s weekly press conference that she would \u201csoon\u201d send the articles to the Senate. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, reportedly expects Pelosi to transmit the articles as soon as tomorrow, with a trial scheduled to begin early next week, but that prediction is not based on any personal intel. The House is currently debating a War Powers Resolution aimed at limiting Trump\u2019s military actions in Iran following the Suleimani strike. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, blamed the Ukrainian passenger jet crash, which killed dozens of Canadians, on Iran, echoing reports that the plane was mistakently hit by an Iranian missile. Trump claimed Suleimani was \u201clooking to blow up our embassy\u201d when he was killed in a US drone strike, although the president did not provide evidence to back up that claim. Maanvi will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Trump just left for his Ohio campaign rally without stopping to talk to reporters who were gathered at the White House to pose questions about impeachment and Iran. The president and vice president are hosting a campaign rally tonight in Toledo, Ohio, where Trump is scheduled to speak at 7 p.m. ET. Congressman Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee, said his panel has no plans of calling John Bolton to testify before the Senate impeachment trial. Bolton, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, has said he would testify in a Senate trial if he were subpoenaed, but it\u2019s unclear whether the Republican-controlled Senate would issue a subpoena. House Democrats previously decided against issuing a subpoena to Bolton because the former official signaled he would join a lawsuit seeking a judge\u2019s ruling on whether to comply with a congressional subpoena or the White House guidance not to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry. Nancy Pelosi delivered a floor speech in favor of the War Powers Resolution, which would limit Trump\u2019s military actions in Iran. The House speaker criticized the administration for not seeking congressional authorization before the Suleimani strike, which she called \u201cprovocative and disproportionate.\u201d Democratic lawmakers are racing to backtrack on their earlier comments suggesting the time had come for Nancy Pelosi to submit the articles of impeachment to the Senate. Congressman Adam Smith already walked by his comments about the House speaker, and now senator Dianne Feinstein has abandoned her criticism of Pelosi. The California senator had previoulsy said, \u201cIf we\u2019re going to do it, she should send them over. I don\u2019t see what good delay does.\u201d Feinstein already started to backtrack on those comments earlier today, but this statement underscores her change of heart. In it, the senator says she believes Pelosi is acting out of a \u201csincere desire to ensure a fair process that allows the Senate to consider available evidence -- a goal that all of us should share.\u201d Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell has signed on as a co-sponsor of a resolution from Republican senator Josh Hawley, which would make it possible to dismiss impeachment charges even if the House does not transmit the articles. Hawley\u2019s resolution would change Senate rules to allow senators to render a verdict on impeachment charges starting 25 calendar days after the House has impeached, even if the speaker has not yet submitted the paperwork or named impeachment managers. But it would require two-thirds of the Senate to break a filibuster on the proposal, which seems unlikely given Republicans\u2019 narrow majority. Eric Garcetti, the mayor of Los Angeles, reportedly plans to endorse Joe Biden tomorrow as the former vice president visits the city. The endorsement comes as polls have shown Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren leading in the crucial state, which awards nearly 500 delegates at the nominating convention. Garcetti toyed with the idea of launching his own White House bid before ultimately deciding against entering the field. Congressman Adam Smith, the Democratic chairman of the House armed services committee, said he was not \u201cthreatened\u201d to walk back his earlier comments about it being time for Nancy Pelosi to transmit the articles of impeachment. Smith said on CNN this morning, \u201cI think it was perfectly advisable for the speaker to leverage that, get a better deal. At this point, it doesn\u2019t look like that\u2019s going to happen, and yes, I think it is time to send the impeachment to the Senate.\u201d But Smith quickly walked that back in a pair of tweets, saying, \u201cI misspoke this morning, I do believe we should do everything we can to force the Senate to have a fair trial.\u201d The Washington Democrat claimed he did not communicate with the speaker\u2019s office before walking back the comments, but he added that his staff may have spoken to Pelosi\u2019s team. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his country and others have gathered intelligence indicating the Ukrainian passenger jet that crashed yesterday was shot down by an Iranian missile. At least 63 Canadians were among the 176 people on board, all of whom died in the crash. Trudeau said the attack may have been \u201cunintentional,\u201d echoing earlier reports that the plane may have been targeted by mistake. As reports emerged that she would transmit the articles of impeachment as soon as tomorrow, Nancy Pelosi dodged reporters\u2019 questions about the timing of her next steps, saying she stood by her earlier statement. The House speaker told reporters earlier today that she did not intend to hold the articles indefinitely. \u201cI\u2019ll send them over when I\u2019m ready,\u201d Pelosi said at her weekly press conference. \u201cAnd that\u2019ll probably be soon.\u201d Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell reportedly expects House speaker Nancy Pelosi to transmit the articles of impeachment as soon as tomorrow, clearing the way for a trial to begin early next week. Politico reports: While senators and aides cautioned that McConnell does not have inside intelligence, the remarks serve as key scheduling advice for senators. Most Republicans are now gearing up for the relentless pace of the impeachment trial to start on Monday or Tuesday. \u2018At lunch, we all heard that. And he says: \u2018That\u2019s my best guess,\u2019\u2019 said Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.). \u2018Which means that we\u2019d get started next week.\u2019 Most senators immediately left the chamber after voting on Thursday afternoon, a signal that the trial will not start until after the weekend. The House has now taken up the War Powers Resolution, which is aimed at limiting Trump\u2019s military actions in Iran. Members will debate for two hours before taking a vote, which will not be binding but will force lawmakers to take a position on the issue. Joe Biden\u2019s campaign manager lashed out against Facebook after the social media company announced it would continue to allow political candidates to advertise on its platform without policing content for accuracy. The Biden team has previously criticzed Facebook for allowing Trump\u2019s reelection campaign to air an ad that includes falsehoods about Biden\u2019s record on Ukraine. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s campaign can (and will) still lie in political ads,\u201d Biden\u2019s deputy communications director said in a statement. \u201cFacebook can (and will) still profit off it. Today\u2019s announcement is more window dressing around their decision to allow paid misinformation.\u201d Meanwhile, the Trump campaign celebrated the news as a victory for democracy. \u201cOur ads are always accurate so it\u2019s good that Facebook won\u2019t limit political messages because it encourages more Americans to be involved in the process,\u201d said Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh. Congressman Max Rose, a freshman Democrat from New York, has said he will oppose the War Powers Resolution aimed at limiting Trump\u2019s military actions in Iran. \u201cUnfortunately, today\u2019s War Powers Resolution is a non-binding resolution that simply restates existing law and sends the message that war is imminent,\u201d Rose said in a statement explaining his vote. \u201cI refuse to play politics with questions of war and peace.\u201d Trump has already encouraged Republicans to oppose the resolution, which faces an uncertain future in the Senate. Another Democratic lawmaker who had said it was time for Nancy Pelosi to transmit the articles of impeachment is now changing her tune. Senator Dianne Feinstein, a fellow California Democrat, previously said, \u201cIf we\u2019re going to do it, she should send them over. I don\u2019t see what good delay does.\u201d Earlier today, another Democratic lawmaker, congressman Adam Smith, had to walk back comments he made indicating he believed it was time to send the articles to the Senate. Avenatti set for trial(s) Former thorn in Donald Trump\u2019s side and very much ex-omnipresence on our television screens and at the side of former client and alleged past-Trumpian paramour Stormy Daniels - attorney Michael Avenatti - had a bad day in court today. A New York judge rejected Avenatti\u2019s bid to dismiss a criminal charge that he defrauded a client whom he said knew about improper payments that sportswear giant Nike allegedly made to families of college basketball recruits. US district judge Paul Gardephe in Manhattan ruled three days after refusing to dismiss two extortion charges accusing Avenatti of threatening a news conference about the payments unless Nike paid him up to $25 million. Nike has denied wrongdoing. \u201cWhen the actual evidence is heard at trial rather than the baseless allegations in the indictment, I will be fully cleared because I did nothing wrong,\u201d Avenatti, 48, said in a text message. \u201cI am innocent,\u201d Reuters reports. The fraud count and one extortion count carry maximum 20-year prison terms, with the trial scheduled for January 21. Avenatti also faces an April 21 trial in Manhattan for allegedly cheating StormyDaniels out of proceeds from a book contract, and a May 19 trial in Santa Ana, California for allegedly defrauding clients out of millions of dollars and lying to the Internal Revenue Service. Avenatti denies all the charges. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Nancy Pelosi said she would \u201csoon\u201d transmit the articles of impeachment to the Senate, but the House speaker declined to provide a specific timeline for her next steps. US officials are confident the Ukrainian passenger jet that crashed on Wednesday was accidentally shot down by Iran. Trump claimed Iranian general Qassem Suleimani was \u201clooking to blow up our embassy\u201d when he was killed in a US drone strike, but he did not provide evidence for that. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. A newly released poll found former Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg, former vice president Joe Biden and Vermont senator Bernie Sanders leading the Democratic presidential primary in New Hampshire. According to the Monmouth University poll, Buttigieg is attracting the support of 20% of New Hampshire Democrats, putting him 1 point ahead of Biden and 2 points ahead of Sanders. Considering the margin of error of 4.9 points, the three candidates are in a statistical tie for the lead, while Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren trails slightly at 15%. New Hampshire will hold its primary on February 11, eight days after Iowa holds the first caucuses of the race. Although the two states are viewed as critically important for helping presidential candidates to build momentum, they are both much whiter than the broader Democratic Party, raising questions about whether the results there will indicate the eventual nominee. The poll also does not help any additional candidates qualify for the next debate, which will be held Tuesday in Des Moines. Currently, only five candidates -- Biden, Sanders, Warren, Buttigieg and Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar -- have qualified. Asked about John Bolton\u2019s potential testimony during the impeachment trial, Trump again said the question of whether to subpoena his former national security adviser would be left up to the Senate. \u201cI always got along with him,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t get along with some of our people, but that\u2019s really going to be up to the Senate.\u201d But the US president interestingly noted he would confer with his lawyers to determine how to \u201cprotect presidential privilege,\u201d indicating the White House might seek to limit Bolton\u2019s testimony. \u201cWe have to protect presidential privilege for me but for future presidents,\u201d Trump told reporters attending his environmental regulation event. Speaking to reporters during his environmental regulation event, Trump said he had come up with a \u201cbeautiful\u201d name for NATO Middle East, emphasizing his desire for the international alliance to get more involved in the region. The US president also said that the name of the renegotiated North American trade deal -- USMCA to stand for for the United States, Mexico and Canada agreement -- was inspired by the song \u201cYMCA.\u201d As reports emerged that US officials believe Iran struck down the Ukrainian airliner that went down yesterday, Trump said he thought the crash may have been the result of a \u201cmistake\u201d on the \u201cother side.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Dan Sabbagh and Michael Safi have more details on the crash: The Ukrainian passenger jet that crashed shortly after takeoff from Tehran on Wednesday was accidentally shot down by an Iranian anti-aircraft missile, western security officials believe. UK sources told the Guardian that the UK had seen US intelligence that suggested that the plane was hit by an Iranian air defence missile. Separately, officials told US media they had identified the signature from an Iranian anti-aircraft missile battery being activated shortly before the aircraft crashed into countryside south-west of the Iranian capital, killing all on 176 on board. The officials also said they had identified the infrared signature from two suspected missile launches followed shortly afterwards by the infra red blip from the burning and fatally disabled aircraft. Speaking to reporters during an event regarding environmental regulation, Trump said the US targeted Iranian general Qassem Suleimani because he was \u201clooking to blow up our embassy.\u201d \u201cWe did it because they were looking to blow up our embassy,\u201d the US president said. \u201cWe also did it for other reasons that were very obvious. Somebody died, one of our military people died, people were badly wounded just a week before.\u201d US officials have said Suleimani was planning an \u201cimminent\u201d attack on Americans, but they have declined to provide further details about the threat. It\u2019s unclear whether the planned embassy strike Trump described was the same \u201cimminent\u201d attack that US officials have referenced. US officials reportedly believe Iran shot down the Ukraine International Airlines plane that crashed yesterday, killing all 176 people on board. According to CBS News, the plane may have been mistakenly targeted just hours after Iran launched its missile attack in response to the US strike on Iranian general Qassem Suleimani. Nancy Pelosi was wrapping up her news conference but came back to the podium to take a question about whether she would attend the San Francisco 49ers game this weekend. The House speaker also laughed along with reporters as she took a question about whether the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will move to California now that they\u2019re stepping back from their royal duties. Nancy Pelosi said it is \u201cfor sure\u201d time to get rid of the Authorization for Use of Military Force in Iraq, which the Trump administration is using as its legal justification for launching military missions against Iran. But the House speaker noted the complicated nature of crafting a new AUMF, which would have to determine the timing, geography and scope of conflict. Pelosi earlier criticized Trump for launching the strike against Iranian general Qassem Suleimani without seeking congressional authorization. Nancy Pelosi\u2019s comments this morning, saying she would \u201csoon\u201d transmit the articles of impeachment, cast doubt on the possibility of starting a Senate trial next week. A number of senators, including some Democrats, had said they hoped the trial could start next week, but Pelosi did not provide a specific timeline for when the articles would be sent over. Although Nancy Pelosi said she would \u201csoon\u201d transmit the articles of impeachment, the House speaker did not provide a specific timeline. \u201cI think we should move smartly and strategically,\u201d Pelosi said of Democrats\u2019 thinking on holding back the articles. Asked how long she was willing to delay transmitting the articles of impeachment, Nancy Pelosi argued her stalling had been successful because of the developments that have unfolded in the past few weeks. The House speaker pointed to the release of administration emails revealing new details about the freeze on Ukraine\u2019s military aid and former national security adviser John Bolton\u2019s willingness to testify. However, Pelosi said she did not plan to hold the articles indefinitely. \u201cI\u2019ll send them over when I\u2019m ready,\u201d the speaker said. \u201cAnd that\u2019ll probably be soon.\u201d Speaking to reporters at her weekly press conference, Nancy Pelosi repeated her desire to understand the parameters of a Senate trial before transmitting the articles of impeachment. \u201cAs I\u2019ve said right from the start: we need to see the arena in which we are sending our managers,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cIs that too much to ask?\u201d The speaker added that she was concerned senators would not live up to their oath to hold an impartial trial to determine whether Trump should be removed from office. \u201cNonetheless, at some point, we would hope that we would see from them what the terms of engagement will be,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cWe are ready, we are proud of our defense of the Constitution of the United States.\u201d Nancy Pelosi told reporters that the House would today pass a war powers resolution aimed at limiting Trump\u2019s military actions in Iran. Trump has told Republicans to vote against the resolution, and it faces an uncertain future in the Senate. House speaker Nancy Pelosi has taken the podium for her weekly press conference at the Capitol. She opened her remarks by saying lawmakers would be celebrating the recent wedding of congresswoman Barbara Lee, who was married on new year\u2019s eve in California. Entering the Capitol this morning, House speaker Nancy Pelosi said she knows \u201cexactly when\u201d to transmit the articles of impeachment. But Pelosi added, \u201cI won\u2019t be telling you right now.\u2033 The speaker said her thinking on the matter has not changed. \u201cSame thing I\u2019ve said before,\u201d Pelosi told the AP. \u201cWe\u2019d like to see how we\u2019re going to proceed, and then we\u2019ll know who to send. \u201cI have an obligation to my members, especially those on the committees, to do justice to their work.\u201d Pelosi is expected to speak to reporters at her weekly press conference in the next couple minutes. Trump was the target of some Twitter jokes after he mistakenly referred to the common retirement fund 401K as a \u201c409K.\u201d The typo immediately set off a round of Twitter jokes about needing to set up a 409K. Democratic congressman Adam Smith, the chairman of the House armed services committee, walked back his comments this morning about Nancy Pelosi transmitting the articles of impeachment. Smith said this morning that he believed the time had come for the House speaker to send the articles to the Senate. \u201cI think it was perfectly advisable for the speaker to leverage that, get a better deal,\u201d Smith told CNN. \u201cAt this point, it doesn\u2019t look like that\u2019s going to happen, and yes, I think it is time to send the impeachment to the Senate, and let Mitch McConnell be responsible for the fairness of the trial. He ultimately is.\u201d Another House Democrat, freshman Ben McAdams of Utah, has joined the growing chorus of lawmakers saying it\u2019s time for Nancy Pelosi to transmit the articles of impeachment. Pelosi has previously shown a high level of concern for freshman lawmakers like McAdams, who will face difficult reelection races later this year. Asked about Democratic congressman Adam Smith\u2019s comments this morning on transmitting the articles of impeachment, Nancy Pelosi offered no comment. Smith, the chairman of the armed services committee, told CNN this morning that he believed the time had come to send the articles to the Senate. Pelosi has a press conference scheduled for 10:45 a.m. ET, where she will likely address her timeline for transmitting the articles. Some Senate Democrats have said they think it\u2019s time for House speaker Nancy Pelosi to transmit the articles of impeachment. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to do it, she should send them over. I don\u2019t see what good delay does,\u201d senator Dianne Feinstein said. Senator Chris Murphy predicted the impeachment trial would soon get underway. \u201cMy expectation is that we\u2019ll be able to start this trial next week,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cThe leverage over Republicans exists in the votes we take inside the trial.\u201d And senator Joe Manchin similarly said it was time to send over the articles, but he said Pelosi\u2019s delay strategy had at lease one success, pointing to former national security adviser John Bolton\u2019s statement about his willingness to testify if subpoenaed. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell again made clear yesterday that he had no intention of allowing Nancy Pelosi\u2019s decision to delay sending the articles of impeachment to affect the parameters of the Senate trial. The Senate leader reportedly met with Trump yesterday to discuss the looming impeachment trial. CNN reports: McConnell, one of the sources said, walked Trump through the trial format and discussed how Senate Republicans were reacting to the developments around the trial. McConnell was at the White House to introduce Trump to a judge, and later the Senate leader and the President met privately. The senator from Kentucky has not shared with the White House the text of the resolution that would set up the trial, according to one of the sources, who insists there\u2019s no negotiation with the GOP leader\u2019s office on how the language should be drafted. Democrats have previously complained about improper coordination between the White House and McConnell\u2019s office as the Senate moves toward the impeachment trial, and this meeting with Trump will only intensify those gripes. Good morning, live blog readers! House speaker Nancy Pelosi is coming under increasing pressure to transmit the articles of impeachment, as even some of her own Democratic caucus members say it\u2019s time to advance the issue to the Senate. Democratic congressman Adam Smith, the chair of the armed services committee, said this morning that he thought the time had come to send the articles to the Senate. \u201cI think it was perfectly advisable for the speaker to leverage that, get a better deal,\u201d Smith told CNN. \u201cAt this point, it doesn\u2019t look like that\u2019s going to happen, and yes, I think it is time to send the impeachment to the Senate, and let Mitch McConnell be responsible for the fairness of the trial. He ultimately is.\u201d Pelosi will hold her weekly press conference later this morning, which could provide some clues on when the Senate might be able to hold a trial on whether to remove Donald Trump from office. Here\u2019s what else the blog is keeping its eye on: Trump will announce proposed National Environmental Policy Act regulations and receive his intelligence briefing before traveling to Toledo, Ohio, for a campaign rally alongside Pence. The House will vote on a resolution to limit Trump\u2019s military actions in Iran. Joe Biden is campaigning in California, touring the Gerald Desmond Bridge Replacement Project in Long Beach and holding a fundraiser. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned.",

Conversation on forums, and in a risk assessment that was rapidly produced by the organisations OpsGroup, pointed to the sudden and catastrophic nature of the event, including the loss of both communications and tracking systems. Fail-safe systems that would have allowed the aircraft to get back safely in the event of engine failure appeared to have been compromised in an instant. Others pointed to what looked like penetrating holes in the airframe, leading some to compare them to the damage suffered by the Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 shot down over Ukraine by a Buk surface-to-air missile five years ago. By Thursday morning, there was another piece in the puzzle to contend with: an unverified photograph from the crash site purporting to show the \u201cseeker head\u201d from a Russian-built Tor-M1 surface-to-air missile of the kind used by Iranian air defence units. Hours later those suspicions appeared to become more concrete as US defence and intelligence officials supplied the alleged missing link that many had been waiting for. They disclosed that the US had picked up the signature of an anti-aircraft missile battery locking on to the Ukrainian plane, and then the infrared heat signal of two missile launches followed by that of an explosion on the plane.

The statements come amid tensions between the US and Iran following the American assassination of the head of the al-Quds Force in Baghdad and the Iranian retaliation in a missile barrage targeting US forces in Iraq in the hours ahead of the crash. Aviation insiders had already been warning against a rival theory, that the relatively new Boeing 737-800, which had been serviced just two days before, could have suffered a so-called uncontained engine failure, where debris is blown out of a failing engine into the fuselage and damages key systems.

          "bodyText": "The Ukrainian passenger jet that crashed shortly after takeoff from Tehran on Wednesday was accidentally shot down by an Iranian anti-aircraft missile, western security officials believe. Intelligence sources told the Guardian their assessments suggest two surface-to-air missiles had targeted the Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 that went down in Iran on Wednesday morning, killing all 176 people onboard. Iran was inviting experts from Boeing, the jetliner\u2019s manufacturer, to join the investigation into the crash, the Iranian official news agency IRNA said on Friday, while the US National Transportation Safety Board said it had received \u201cformal notification\u201d of the crash from Iran and had designated a representative to the crash inquiry. Iran\u2019s aviation authority had said earlier it would not hand over flight recorders to either Boeing or US aviation authorities but would give Ukrainian investigators access to the inquiry. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said his government \u201cwill not rest\u201d until it got justice. \u201cWe have intelligence, including from our allies and own intelligence that the plane was shot down by Iranian surface-to-air missiles,\u201d Trudeau said. \u201cCanadians want answers. That means transparency, accountability and justice.\u201d Western agencies are understood to have picked up signals of the missile launches followed by the traces of an explosion. A British source said: \u201cThe assessment is that it looks like it is a tragic accident.\u201d In a statement on Thursday night, Boris Johnson said: \u201cThere is now a body of information that the flight was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile. This may well have been unintentional. We are working closely with Canada and our international partners and there now needs to be a full, transparent investigation.\u201d Of the 176 people onboard, 78 were Iranian, 63 were Canadian and 11 were Ukrainian (including nine crew members), along with 10 Swedes, seven Afghans, four Britons and three German nationals. There was some confusion over the nationality of those killed with many holding dual citizenship. The passenger aircraft crashed in farmland on the outskirts of Tehran a few hours after Iran had launched more than a dozen missiles at US forces stationed in Iraq, during a period when Revolution Guards commanders say they were expecting an imminent American response and were on high alert. The revelation that the plane might have been shot down will prompt a reassessment of the consequences of Donald Trump\u2019s decision to assassinate the Iranian general Qassem Suleimani last week, an escalation of hostilities that brought the region to the brink of all-out conflict. Iranian officials on Thursday rejected the western intelligence assessments. \u201cScientifically, it is impossible that a missile hit the Ukrainian plane, and such rumours are illogical,\u201d Ali Abedzadeh, the head of Iran\u2019s of Civil Aviation Organisation told a state-run media outlet. Separately, US media outlets quoted officials saying their satellites had identified the signature of an Iranian anti-aircraft battery being activated shortly before the aircraft went down a few minutes after taking off at 6.13am on Wednesday morning. The US officials said they had identified infrared signals from two suspected missiles, followed shortly afterwards by an infrared blip from the burning aircraft. Trump told reporters on Thursday he had \u201csuspicions\u201d the plane might have been mistakenly shot down. \u201cSomeone could have made a mistake on the other side,\u201d he said. \u201cSome people say it was mechanical, I personally don\u2019t think that\u2019s even a question. I have a feeling that \u2026 something very terrible happened.\u201d The Pentagon declined to comment. Public suspicions that the Boeing 737-800 may have accidentally been shot down had grown throughout Thursday based on images circulating on social media showing what appeared to be missile debris that was purportedly photographed near the crash site. The London-based firm IHS Markit cited the images in a memo arguing the aircraft was \u201clikely to have been shot down mistakenly by an IRGC-operated SA-15 missile\u201d. It said the debris appeared to be that of a Russian-made Tor-M1 missile known to be possessed by Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards. It could not confirm the authenticity of the images but said it assessed them to be credible. Iranian investigators had said earlier on Thursday their preliminary conclusion was that the plane had suffered a catastrophic technical problem, caught on fire and crashed as it tried to return to Tehran\u2019s Imam Khomeini International airport. They confirmed they had recovered the aircraft\u2019s two black boxes, recording instruments designed to survive a high-impact crash, but said the devices appeared to have suffered damage and could have been missing some memory.

By Thursday morning, Ukraine\u2019s top national security official was openly discussing in a Facebook post the possibility the aircraft may have been shot down. \u201cOur commission is currently agreeing with the Iranian authorities to travel to the place of the crash, and plans to search for debris of a [Russian-made] surface-to-air Tor missile, according to information which was published on the internet,\u201d Oleksiy Danilov said. A Ukrainian investigative team was at the crash site on Thursday. And the Iranian government spokesman, Ali Rabiei said that any country which lost citizens on the flight would be welcome to send representatives. The head of the official Iranian Investigative Committee, Hassan Rezaeifar, said that the US had also been invited, as the home nation of the plane\u2019s manufacturer, Boeing, according to the country\u2019s semi-official Fars news agency. Some members of the Ukrainian investigative team had been involved in the inquiry into the 2014 shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine by Russian-armed rebels, Danilov added. \u201cWe will use all our best practices from investigating the attack on MH17 to find out the truth in the case of the Ukrainian plane in Tehran,\u201d he said. Iran\u2019s aviation authority said on Wednesday it would not hand over flight recorders either to the aircraft\u2019s American manufacturer or to US aviation authorities, but that it would give Ukrainian investigators access to the investigation. But Ali Abedzadeh appeared to backtrack on Thursday, saying claims in the Iranian media that the black boxes would not be sent overseas were \u201ca mistake taken by the reporter\u201d.",

Iranian authorities have blamed mechanical issues, which they said happened shortly after the plane left Tehran\u2019s main airport at 6.13am on Wednesday.</p> \n<p>The timing of the disaster, a few

the plane could have been shot down near Tehran without a missile, or the rocket battery from which it was fired, leaving traces.</p> \n<p>Justin Bronk, a research fellow at the Royal United Service Institute, previously told the Guardian that he believed on balance the incident was \u201ca tragic coincidence\u201d.</p> \n<p>He said it would require a fairly large surface-to-air missile to inflict such catastrophic damage on a civilian airliner and \u201cthere was no evidence of a rocket plume\u201d in the videos that have emerged so far. \u201cIt would also be very hard to conceal such a large rocket battery from the ground,\u201d he added.</p> \n<p>Iranian authorities have also rebuffed speculation the aircraft was attacked as part of a hostile misinformation campaign perpetrated by the country\u2019s enemies.</p> \n<p>A preliminary report issued by Iranian investigators into the crash late on Wednesday said the aircraft never made a radio call for help and was trying to turn back to the airport when it went down.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3a0e03a897cf95c85e46eea5d2ab515c3d0aa746\"> \n <img

giving investigators access to data and cockpit communications, though some parts of their memory had been damaged in the crash.</p> \n<p>Iran\u2019s aviation authority said on Wednesday it would not <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/08/iran-says-it-will-not-give-black-box-from-crashed-airliner-to-boeing\">hand over flight recorders</a> either to the aircraft\u2019s American manufacturer or to US aviation authorities, but that it would give Ukrainian investigators access to the investigation.</p> \n<p>But the head of the authority, Ali Abedzadeh, appeared to backtrack on Thursday, saying claims in the Iranian media that the black boxes would not be sent overseas were \u201ca mistake taken by the reporter\u201d.</p> \n<p>Zelenskiy said Ukrainian officials arrived in Tehran early on Thursday and that he would speak to the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, to ensure close cooperation.</p> \n<p>The plane was carrying 167 passengers and nine crew members from several countries, including 82 Iranians, at least 63 Canadians, 11 Ukrainians and three Britons.</p> \n<p>The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, offered his condolences to the families of the victims on Wednesday. \u201cOur government will continue to work closely with its international partners to ensure that \u2026 [the crash] is thoroughly investigated, and that Canadians\u2019 questions are answered,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/08/boeing-737-800-that-crashed-in-tehran-most-popular-model-in-skies\">737-800 belongs to the same family</a> as, but is a different model to, the 737 Max 8 aircraft, which has been grounded since two fatal crashes occurred within six months in Indonesia and Ethiopia in 2018.</p> \n<p>The 737-800 operates with a different software system to the one implicated in the Max 8 crashes.</p> \n<p>The plane had been last serviced two days before the accident, according to the airline.</p> \n<p>Zelenskiy on Thursday invited Britain to join the investigation in a telephone call with the prime minister, Boris Johnson. \u201cThe President of Ukraine invited the United Kingdom to join the investigation. Boris Johnson supported this idea and stressed that the best British experts should be involved in finding out all the circumstances of the tragedy,\u201d his office said in a statement.</p> \n<p>Under international aviation rules, Iran is responsible for running the inquiry.</p>",

          "bodyText": "A senior Ukrainian security official has said his country\u2019s investigators will explore a range of possible reasons why one of its passenger jets crashed in Iran, including a drone collision, a terrorist bomb and a missile attack, but did not rule out a technical fault was to blame. Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of Ukraine\u2019s national security council, cited unconfirmed reports circulating on social media that debris from a Russian-made missile had been found at the site, on the outskirts of Tehran, where the Ukraine International Airlines Boeing 737-800 crashed on Wednesday, killing all 176 passengers and staff onboard. \u201cOur commission is currently agreeing with the Iranian authorities to travel to the place of the crash, and plans to search for debris of a Russian surface-to-air Tor missile, according to information which was published on the internet,\u201d he said in a Facebook post on Thursday. Some members of the investigative team had been involved in the probe into the 2014 shooting down of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over eastern Ukraine by Russian-armed rebels, Danilov added. \u201cWe will use all our best practices from investigating the attack on MH17 to find out the truth in the case of the Ukrainian plane in Tehran,\u201d he said. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, later called for a full investigation into the crash and the reports it could have been caused by something such as a stray missile, following a telephone conversation with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Downing Street said on Thursday. In the phone call, Johnson offered his condolences, offered UK support and was updated on the crash, a No 10 spokesman said. \u201cThe prime minister said that there needed to be a full, credible and transparent investigation into what happened.\u201d Asked whether this meant the UK was concerned about the possible cause of the crash, he said: \u201cI\u2019m not going to speculate on this, but the reports we have seen are very concerning, and we\u2019re urgently looking into them.\u201d Images have been widely circulated online by an Iranian activist showing the remains of what could be a Russian-made Tor-M1 missile that he claimed was found near the plane\u2019s crash site \u2013 but there was no way to independently verify that the debris in the picture shows a missile or if it was taken in the debris field on Wednesday. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said earlier on Thursday that his government was considering \u201cseveral possibilities\u201d but asked people to refrain from speculating about the crash. Iranian authorities have blamed mechanical issues, which they said happened shortly after the plane left Tehran\u2019s main airport at 6.13am on Wednesday. The timing of the disaster, a few hours after Iran fired ballistic missiles at US forces stationed in Iraq in retaliation for its assassination of general Qassem Suleimani, has fuelled speculation that it might have somehow been linked to the hostilities, but so far there has been no evidence to back this up. Aviation and security experts have said it is unlikely the plane could have been shot down near Tehran without a missile, or the rocket battery from which it was fired, leaving traces. Justin Bronk, a research fellow at the Royal United Service Institute, previously told the Guardian that he believed on balance the incident was \u201ca tragic coincidence\u201d. He said it would require a fairly large surface-to-air missile to inflict such catastrophic damage on a civilian airliner and \u201cthere was no evidence of a rocket plume\u201d in the videos that have emerged so far. \u201cIt would also be very hard to conceal such a large rocket battery from the ground,\u201d he added. Iranian authorities have also rebuffed speculation the aircraft was attacked as part of a hostile misinformation campaign perpetrated by the country\u2019s enemies. A preliminary report issued by Iranian investigators into the crash late on Wednesday said the aircraft never made a radio call for help and was trying to turn back to the airport when it went down. Witnesses to the crash on the ground and from passing aircraft said they saw the jet burst into flames while still in the air, according to the report, which stated technical problems were the most likely reason. It confirmed that both the aircraft\u2019s black boxes had been recovered, giving investigators access to data and cockpit communications, though some parts of their memory had been damaged in the crash. Iran\u2019s aviation authority said on Wednesday it would not hand over flight recorders either to the aircraft\u2019s American manufacturer or to US aviation authorities, but that it would give Ukrainian investigators access to the investigation. But the head of the authority, Ali Abedzadeh, appeared to backtrack on Thursday, saying claims in the Iranian media that the black boxes would not be sent overseas were \u201ca mistake taken by the reporter\u201d. Zelenskiy said Ukrainian officials arrived in Tehran early on Thursday and that he would speak to the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, to ensure close cooperation. The plane was carrying 167 passengers and nine crew members from several countries, including 82 Iranians, at least 63 Canadians, 11 Ukrainians and three Britons. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, offered his condolences to the families of the victims on Wednesday. \u201cOur government will continue to work closely with its international partners to ensure that \u2026 [the crash] is thoroughly investigated, and that Canadians\u2019 questions are answered,\u201d he said. The 737-800 belongs to the same family as, but is a different model to, the 737 Max 8 aircraft, which has been grounded since two fatal crashes occurred within six months in Indonesia and Ethiopia in 2018. The 737-800 operates with a different software system to the one implicated in the Max 8 crashes. The plane had been last serviced two days before the accident, according to the airline. Zelenskiy on Thursday invited Britain to join the investigation in a telephone call with the prime minister, Boris Johnson. \u201cThe President of Ukraine invited the United Kingdom to join the investigation. Boris Johnson supported this idea and stressed that the best British experts should be involved in finding out all the circumstances of the tragedy,\u201d his office said in a statement. Under international aviation rules, Iran is responsible for running the inquiry.",

The missiles were launched around 1.30am in Iraq, roughly the same time as the drone strike that killed Suleimani outside Baghdad\u2019s airport on Friday morning. The first projectiles struck their targets shortly after the Iranian general\u2019s coffin was lowered into the ground in the city of Kerman. The Revolutionary Guards called the operation \u201cMartyr Suleimani\u201d. They distributed videos of the missiles being launched to be broadcast across Iranian media.</p> \n   <p>Despite this theatricality, the attacks appear to have been carefully designed to avoid US casualties: fired at bases that were already on high alert and so far registering no confirmed deaths.

Rockets reportedly fell on the \u201cGreen Zone\u201d around the US embassy and military facilities in Baghdad today, but details have been scarce. Trump spoke with Justin Trudeau and Boris Johnson on the phone. The leaders discussed working together to ensure that Iran doesn\u2019t acquire a nuclear weapon. Catch up on news and analysis of the US-Iran crisis: Trump pulls back for now but game of chicken with Tehran far from over The optics of Trump\u2019s announcement: America stands ready to strike EU leaders relieved as Trump steps away from Iran conflict \u2018They took good revenge\u2019: Iranians respond to Iraq strikes False claims spread online after Iran missile attack on Iraqi airbases Mike Pence said the US isn\u2019t seeking a regime change in Iran, but wants \u201cto see the regime change its behavior\u201d in an interview on CBS. The vice-president earlier tweeted that the \u201cAmerica is safer and stronger because of President Trump\u2019s decisive action\u201d toward Iran. Pence\u2019s tone matches that of Trump, vacillating between appearing strong and backing off. As the Guardian\u2019s Tom McCarthy wrote in his analysis, though Trump\u2019s public address this morning, which he delivered while \u201cflanked by cabinet members and backed by eight military officers, communicated a clear subtext: America stood ready to strike\u201d \u2013 even as his speech was notably non-provocative. Lindsey Graham said that fellow Republican senators Mike Lee and Rand Paul were \u201coverreacting\u201d and that those seeking to limit the president\u2019s war powers were \u201cempowering the enemy\u201d. Lee told Fox News that it was \u201cwrong\u201d for the Trump administration to insist that there must be \u201cno dissension\u201d in the GOP over warlike actions from the president. In the aftermath of the Iran missile attacks, there\u2019s been a spread of online disinformation. The Guardian\u2019s Jim Waterson reports: Iran\u2019s missile attacks on two Iraqi airbases have been accompanied by a spread of online disinformation, falsely labelled images and claims of news sources being hacked, which have added to jitters in the region regarding the attacks. Iranian state television said on Wednesday that at least 80 \u201cAmerican terrorists\u201d were killed, despite the US making clear that it had not sustained any casualties as a result of rocket attacks on Iraqi military bases hosting American troops. The attacks occurred in retaliation for the US\u2019s assassination of the powerful Iranian general Qassem Suleimani. Iran has a long history of running state-backed disinformation campaigns which attempt to influence opinion overseas, with Facebook regularly banning Iranian pages it believes are spreading false and divisive material aimed at audiences in the US and UK. Twitter suspended an account impersonating the Israeli journalist Jack Khoury, which had been used to promote false claims that hundreds of US soldiers had been injured in the attacks and claimed they had been secretly evacuated to a hospital in Tel Aviv by a military aircraft. An initial assessment by western intelligence agencies has found that the Ukrainian airliner that crashed in Iran wasn\u2019t brought down by a missile, according to a Reuters report citing an anonymous Canadian security source. Earlier today, Tehran said it would not be handing the plane\u2019s black box to Boeing, fueling concerns that the crash, which killed all 176 passengers, was caused by a missile aimed at Iraqi bases used by US forces. The chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, Mark Milley, told reporters that Iran\u2019s missile attack had been intended to kill American personnel and cause damage to the al-Asad airbase. \u201cI believe, based on what I saw and what I know, is that (the strikes) were intended to cause structural damage, destroy vehicles and equipment and aircraft and to kill personnel. That\u2019s my own personal assessment,\u201d Milley said. \u201cBut the analytics is in the hands of professional intelligence analysts. So they\u2019re looking at that.\u201d The defense secretary, Mark Esper, said the intent has yet to be determined. Hello again, US politics watchers, I take my leave now after a lively day but hand you over to my colleague, Maanvi Singh, in California to take you through the next few hours of US-involved geopolitical events and reaction here in the United States. Key events so far today: The US House will vote tomorrow on new legislation to curb the president\u2019s war powers, after Donald Trump failed to consult or inform Congress before he ordered the assassination of Iranian general Qassem Suleimani last week. Rockets have been falling in the heavily-fortified \u201cGreen Zone\u201d around the US Embassy and military facilities in Baghdad. Details scarce so far. Boris Johnson and Justin Trudeau spoke on the phone about the US-Iranian crisis and the crash of a Ukrainian flight outside Tehran earlier today in which many Canadian passengers were killed. The British foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, and US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, are meeting in Washington this hour. Donald Trump gave a live televised address at the White House this morning, in which he said \u201cIran appears to be standing down\u201d after its relatively restrained missile strike on US facilities in Iraq overnight, and pledged more sanctions against Iran, but also appealed to the Islamic republic to explored \u201cshared priorities\u201d with the US, such as Islamic State. \u201cNo evidence of imminent threat\u201d - Booker Here is some more reaction from both sides of the aisle - but in surprisingly parallel directions, rather than the usual polar opposite. Democratic 2020 candidate Cory Booker just tweeted about the Capitol Hill briefing on the US-Iran crisis. Booker and other Democrats running for president have had their campaigns rudely interrupted by the rising tension over Iran. Less prominent 2020 candidate Tulsi Gabbard was, seconds ago, on CNN saying more or less the same thing. Meanwhile, Republican maverick Senators of the day, Rand Paul of Kentucky, and Utah\u2019s Mike Lee, are also exasperated. Lee told Fox News that the congressional briefing was \u201clame\u201d and that it was \u201cwrong\u201d for the senior Trump administration briefers - the secretary of state, defense secretary, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and director of the CIA - to tell GOP members of congress that there must be \u201cno dissension\u201d in the ranks over any warlike actions from Donald Trump. It seems the members were given very luke warm, unreassuring assurances over whether Congress would be involved in any near future further actions of aggression towards Iran. Lee called it the worst briefing he\u2019d ever heard in his nine years in the Senate. No casualties in Green Zone - initial reports Still very few details about the latest incident in Baghdad. But here are a few more fragments, via Reuters. Sirens were sounding inside the Green Zone. Police sources told Reuters at least one of the rockets fell 100 metres from the US Embassy. \u201cTwo Katyusha rockets fall inside the Green Zone without causing casualties. Details to follow,\u201d the military said. Two loud blasts followed by sirens had been heard in Baghdad, Reuters witnesses said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility. US Democrats, who dominate the House of Representatives, are still furious that they were not consulted or even notified before Donald Trump took unilateral action late last week to assassinate senior Iranian general Qassem Suleimani as he was being driven away from the Baghdad airport in Iraq. It may be no more than a democratic gesture (given that the Republicans dominate the Senate and are foursquare behind their president, Trump) but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has announced the introduction of legislation to curb the president\u2019s war powers, and it will come up for voting tomorrow. As the Guardian\u2019s senior political reporter, Lauren Gambino, just noted. Nancy Pelosi tweeted about it earlier. Here\u2019s a bitter little tit-for-tat on Twitter last weekend. For some slightly deeper dives on this topic, here are interesting pieces about presidential war powers from the New Yorker and NPR. Meanwhile, my world affairs editor colleague, Julian Borger, analyses the bigger picture on the US and Iran and where things stand this afternoon. Latest report, with details just trickling in so far, is of three Katyusha rockets, commonly used my militias, have fallen inside Baghdad\u2019s heavily-fortified Green Zone and have started a fire, police sources report, via Reuters. The US embassy may have been the intended target. Commercial airlines are rerouting flights throughout the Middle East to avoid potential danger during heightened tensions between the US and Iran. Jumbled schedules could affect as many as 15,000 passengers per day, lengthen flight times by an average of 30 to 90 minutes, and severely bruise the bottom line for airlines, industry analysts said, and The Associated Press reported. \u201cIn a war situation, the first casualty is always air transport,\u201d said Dubai-based aviation consult Mark Martin, pointing to airline bankruptcies during the Persian Gulf and Yugoslav wars. At least 500 commercial flights travel through Iranian and Iraqi airspace daily, Martin said. A Ukrainian passenger jet crashed shortly after taking off from Iran\u2019s capital early Wednesday killing 167 passengers and nine crew members just hours after Iran\u2019s ballistic missile attack, but Iranian officials said they suspected a mechanical issue brought down the Boeing 737-800 aircraft. Ukrainian officials initially agreed, but later backed away and declined to offer a cause while the investigation is ongoing. Air France and Dutch carrier KLM both said Wednesday that they had suspended all flights over Iranian and Iraqi airspace indefinitely. German airline Lufthansa and two of its subsidiaries also canceled flights to Iraq. The Russian aviation agency, Rosaviatsia, issued an official recommendation for all Russian airlines to avoid flying over Iran, Iraq, the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman \u201cdue to existing risks for the safety of international civil flights.\u201d Australian carrier Qantas said it was altering its London to Perth, Australia, route to avoid Iranian and Iraqi airspace until further notice. Malaysia and Singapore Airlines are re-routing, too. The US Federal Aviation Administration said it was barring American pilots and carriers from flying in areas of Iraqi, Iranian and some Persian Gulf airspace. Initial reports coming in suggest that there were two loud blasts, moments ago, followed by sirens, Reuters witnesses said. The cause was not immediately clear. The quartet of US secretary of state Mike Pompeo, the still relatively new defense secretary Mark Esper, chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff Mark Milley and the historically-controversial CIA director Gina Haspel strode across Capitol Hill today to brief members of Congress on the Iran issues. There is some difference of perspective on how effective the briefing was. Here is a reported take from a Republican member of Congress: And: Senior Democrat and chairman of the House foreign affairs committee, Eliot Engel, who was deeply involved in the Trump impeachment inquiry, was unimpressed. Mixed reaction from libertarian Republican Rand Paul: Democrat Pramila Jayapal said of the administration\u2019s stated justification for assassinating Iranian general Qassem Suleimani in the Baghdad area last week: \u201cThere was NO raw evidence presented that this [Suleimani plotting against US] was an imminent threat.\u201d British prime minister Boris Johnson and his Canadian counterpart, Justin Trudeau, had a telephone call with each other earlier in which they discussed the need for urgent de-escalation on all sides in the US-Iran crisis following Iranian missile attacks on military bases housing US troops in Iraq overnight, a spokesperson for Johnson said. The leaders also discussed working together, and with international partners, to ensure Iran is prevented from acquiring a nuclear weapon. Johnson also offered condolences for the Canadians who lost their lives in the Ukrainian airliner that crashed shortly after take-off from Tehran on Wednesday, killing all 176 people on board. There are few specifics available in terms of the two leaders\u2019 reactions to Donald Trump announcing this morning the intention for the US to impose further sanctions on Iran, and the US president\u2019s urging of allies to abandon the \u201cremnants\u201d of the Iran Nuclear Deal, the international accord to trade a loosening of sanctions for Iran\u2019s backing off from developing their own nuclear missile capability. The pre-dawn crash of a US-built Boeing airliner in Iran earlier today, with the loss of 176 lives, looks set to strain fragile international protocols on co-operation in air disaster investigations at a time when the United States and Iran are already mired in confrontation. The relatively new Boeing 737-800NG jet flown by Ukraine International Airlines burst into flames shortly after take-off from Tehran and crashed on Wednesday, Reuters writes this afternoon. The results of an investigation and even the way it is set up and coordinated could inflame political differences as mystery surrounds the jet\u2019s sudden nosedive, analysts said. Iran and the United States are co-signatories of the basic global agreement on modern aviation 75 years ago and sit together at the United Nations\u2019 aviation agency. The 1944 Chicago Convention gave rise to strict rules about how air accidents should be investigated, marking a blueprint for co-operation that has largely stood the test of time even as member countries shunned other types of diplomatic cooperation. As the country where the jet was designed and built, the United States has a right to be accredited to the investigation and would normally appoint Boeing, which is bogged down in its own corporate and safety crisis involving its ground 737 Max aircraft type, as its own technical adviser. But Wednesday\u2019s crash immediately triggered fresh signs of international distrust. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the US was prepared to offer Ukraine assistance but he did not mention any role for Iran in the ensuing investigation. It\u2019s been a lively day so far in US-facing international politics. There will be plenty more developments to come, so do read on. Here are the key events so far: British foreign secretary Dominic Raab and US secretary of state Mike Pompeo will meet in Washington later today. The event was brought forward and was originally scheduled to happen tomorrow. Earlier, Boris Johnson and Donald Trump talked on the phone, but almost no details have emerged. The US has promised full cooperation in investigations following the crash of a Ukrainian passenger flight shortly after take-off from Tehran in the early hours. There is unofficial talk that it was shot down. Donald Trump ended his live address at the White House earlier by appealing to Iran to coordinate with the US on \u201cshared priorities\u201d such as shutting off ISIS. Trump said in his address that Iran appears to be \u201cstanding down\u201d after missile launches from Iran towards US forces in Iraq almost 24 hours ago avoided (perhaps deliberately, according to sources) causing any US casualties. Nevertheless, Trump announced more economic sanctions on Iran and asked NATO to get more involved. Influential Iraqi Shi\u2019ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr said a little earlier today that the crisis Iraq was experiencing in recent days of heightened international tension is now over following de-escalation rhetoric from both Iran and the US. He called on Iranian-backed militia groups not to carry out attacks. A new, strong Iraqi government able to protect the nation\u2019s sovereignty and independence should be formed in the next 15 days and usher in an early election, the populist cleric said in a statement, Reuters reports. He added that Iraqis should still seek to expel foreign troops, however. \u201cI call on the Iraqi factions to be deliberate, patient, and not to start military actions, and to shut down the extremist voices of some rogue elements until all political, parliamentary and international methods have been exhausted,\u201d he said. The Guardian\u2019s latest view on the US-Iran crisis is that relief from tension and aggression may be short-lived. Dominic Raab, Britain\u2019s foreign secretary, arrived in Washington an hour ago. He had been expected to meet with counterpart Mike Pompeo, US secretary of state, tomorrow but the meeting has been brought forward to late this afternoon. It\u2019s now expected to take place at 4.30pm ET/9.30pm GMT this afternoon. So far, we understand the two will not make public remarks before they disappear into their t\u00eate-a-t\u00eate but that could always change in the moment. The two have met before, several times, and this was a pre-planned visit following the Conservative Party victory in December\u2019s UK general election. It\u2019s not an emergency meeting following the eruption of the US-Iran crisis in the last week (which affects NATO, British troops in Iraq, Britain\u2019s participation in the Iran nuclear deal and British interests overall in a stable Middle East). But there seems little doubt the events of the last six days will now be on the agenda. Donald Trump urged Britain and others earlier today to join the US in abandoning the Iran nuclear deal. Meanwhile, a terse read-out from the White House on a phone call earlier today between Donald Trump and British prime minister Boris Johnson. \u201cThe two leaders discussed the current situation in the Middle East and agreed to continue close coordination in support of shared national security interests.\u201d The US did not consult nor notify the UK before it assassinated Iranian general Qassem Suleimani last week. From Istanbul today: Turkey and Russia called on the US and Iran to prioritize diplomacy and de-escalate tensions, warning that the exchange of attacks by Washington and Tehran could lead to a new cycle of instability in the region. The joint call was issued in a statement after a meeting between presidents Tayyip Erdogan and Vladimir Putin in Turkey, where they were discussing cooperation on a gas pipeline, designed to connect the large gas reserves in Russia to the Turkish gas transportation network and provide energy supplies for Turkey, south and south-east Europe. In part, the joint statement read: \u201cWe are deeply concerned about the escalation of the tension between the US and Iran as well as its negative repercussions on Iraq. We evaluate the targeting..of Qassem Suleimani and his entourage in Baghdad on 3 January as an act undermining security and stability in the region. \u201cIn light of the ballistic missile attacks by Iran against coalition military bases in Iraq on 8 January 2020, we believe that exchange of attacks and use of force by any party do not contribute to finding solutions to the complex problems in the Middle East, but rather would lead to a new cycle of instability and would eventually damage everyone\u2019s interests.\u201d US secretary of state Mike Pompeo said a little earlier that the United States was calling for complete cooperation with any investigation into the cause of the crash of a Ukrainian airliner shortly after it took off from Tehran just over 12 hours ago. In a statement, Pompeo said the US was prepared to offer Ukraine all possible assistance after the crash of the Ukraine International Airlines Boeing 737, which burst into flames shortly after take-off from Tehran on Wednesday, killing all 176 people aboard. There is speculation that the plane was shot down, and it appeared to burst into flames in mid-air. There is no confirmation of, or official lines on, causes yet. Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister, Vadym Prystaiko, said that there were 82 Iranians, 63 Canadians and 11 Ukrainians on board. The Ukrainian nationals included two passengers and the nine crew. There were also 10 Swedish passengers, four Afghans, three Germans and three British nationals, my Guardian colleagues in London and the Middle East report. Meanwhile, announcing on his Facebook page that Ukraine would send a team of experts to Iran later today, president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said: \u201cOur priority is to establish the truth and those responsible for this terrible catastrophe.\u201d Highlights of Trump speech Here are some more detailed quotes of some of the main points made in the US president\u2019s short address from the White House a little earlier. Iran seen as standing down. \u201cNo Americans were harmed in last night\u2019s attack by the Iranian regime. We suffered no casualties. All of our soldiers are safe and only minimal damage was sustained at our military bases. Our great American forces are prepared for anything. Iran appears to be standing down, which is a good thing for all parties concerned and a very good thing for the world.\u201d Boasting of US strength. \u201cOur missiles are big, powerful, accurate, lethal and fast...The fact that we have this great military and equipment, however, does not mean we have to use it. We do not want to use it. American strength, both military and economic, is the best deterrent.\u201d A new Iran deal? Much to US allies\u2019 chagrin, Trump announced in 2018 that the US intended to \u201cexit\u201d the 2013, multi-national Iran nuclear deal aimed at persuading Iran to abandon the pursuit of nuclear weapons in return for the easing of harsh economic sanctions. Trump said moments ago: \u201cIran must abandon its nuclear ambitions and end its support for terrorism. The time has come for the United Kingdom, Greece, France, Russia and China to recognize this reality. They must now break away from the remnants of the Iran deal, or JCPOA.\u201d Further sanctions: \u201cAs we continue to evaluate options in response to Iranian aggression, the United States will immediately impose additional punishing economic sanctions on the Iranian regime. These powerful sanctions will remain until Iran changes its behavior.\u201d No details given. NATO: \u201cThe civilized world must send a clear and unified message to the Iranian regime: your campaign of terror, murder, mayhem will not be tolerated any longer. It will not be allowed to go forward. Today I am going to ask NATO to become much more involved in the Middle East process.\u201d Donald Trump rounded off his short TV address to the public with what might normally be considered some small-talk or waffle but in the current context and with this president counts as actual diplomatic outreach. It may be no more than lip service. But given that Trump often opts for bellicose and extremely simplistic rhetoric in denouncing or threatening anyone he regards as a foe, his closing sentences were noteworthy. In fact, all the signals from the last 19 or so hours are that both Iran and the US have embarked on a hasty de-escalation of their sudden crisis. As he wound down his speech moments ago, Trump referred to the battle against Islamic State, and American forces\u2019 assassination of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi last October. But then he swiftly pivoted. \u201cISIS is a natural enemy of Iran,\u201d Trump said at the White House. \u201cWe should work together on this and other shared priorities. To the people and leaders of Iran, we want you to have a future, and a great future, one that you deserve, of prosperity and harmony.\u201d He concluded that the US is \u201cready to embrace peace with all who seek it.\u201d This might be meaningless chat from the US president but indicates an unusual level-headedness, however brief, communicated via Trump by those advising him and is a clear de-escalation of the rhetoric. In his short speech, Donald Trump, who has been scathing and mocking of NATO, called on the alliance to \u201cget more involved in the Middle East\u201d. He didn\u2019t go into further detail and went on to boast that the USA is now self-sufficient in oil and natural gas, as \u201cthe number one producer in the world\u201d, and said: \u201cWe do not need Middle East oil.\u201d Trump then asserted, in warning Iran in characteristic tone, that \u201cour missiles are big and powerful and accurate...and lethal.\u201d He said he didn\u2019t want to use force, however, and said that \u201cAmerica\u2019s strength, both military and economic, is the best deterrent.\u201d The US president just declared that he will impose additional economic sanctions on Iran. He is calling on Europe to \u201cbreak away from the remnants of the Iran nuclear deal\u201d, which he called a \u201cfoolish\u201d deal and had previously announced the US would abandon. Trump has not given any details about the nature of further sanctions. Donald Trump has described last week\u2019s missile assassination of Iranian general Qassem Suleimani as \u201cdecisive action to stop a ruthless terrorist\u201d. \u201cLast week we eliminated the world\u2019s top terrorist,\u201d he said at the White House. Donald Trump has announced that there were no US casualties in the Iranian missile strikes on US facilities in Iraq last night. \u201cIran appears to be standing down,\u201d he said. The president has arrived and is now speaking. The US president is about to arrive at a briefing podium in the White House and will begin speaking shortly on the latest developments in the US-Iran crisis. Watch, live. Vice president Mike Pence and secretary of state Mike Pompeo just entered. US Congress in limbo over Trump\u2019s actions against Iran Senior US House Democrats a little earlier today said there is no set schedule yet for voting on a war powers resolution that would limit Donald Trump\u2019s actions regarding Iran, and that legislation is still being drafted. Representatives are seeking to put a check on the president\u2019s power after he failed to inform Congress in advance of the US drone strike last week that killed top Iranian commander Qassem Suleimani as he was driving away from Baghdad airport in Iraq. We are waiting for US president Donald Trump to make a televised address, live. He\u2019s behind schedule by almost 15 minutes so far. Meanwhile, despite what is being interpreted as relative restraint by Iran in its missile strikes last night, both towards the US and Iraq, the latest from Reuters is that the Iraqi foreign ministry plans to summon the Iranian ambassador in order to lodge an objection to the missile strikes on its soil. The White House press pool has been called to gather at the door of the Palm Room at the White House. They are waiting to enter an area called the grand foyer, in preparation for the president\u2019s address at the top of the hour. Portraits of Qassem Suleimani have been carried aloft in rallies from Gaza to Yemen, raising the prospect that his violent death will elevate him as an icon of anti-American resistance. The powerful Iranian commander, who was buried on Wednesday, was hailed as a \u201cliving martyr\u201d in the Islamic republic for his military and strategic exploits that included halting the Islamic State group as it rampaged across Iraq and Syria, the AFP agency writes. After his assassination at the age of 62, in a US drone strike in Baghdad last week, some observers say his martyr status will grow, rendering him a figurehead for the disparate pro-Iranian groups that he guided and fostered. \u201cThe shock factor isn\u2019t so much that Suleimani has died - he was after all in many battles - but the way the US president has taken ownership of this will create that type of zeal and drive and commitment across the Middle East,\u201d said Ellie Geranmayeh from the European Council on Foreign Relations. Suleimani was a polarising figure, even within his own country. But the so-called Iranian \u201caxis of resistance\u201d stretching from Iran to the Mediterranean Sea will now be \u201cgalvanised to focus more on their ultimate goal, which is the US withdrawal from as much of the Middle East as possible,\u201d Geranmayeh told AFP. Among Muslim Shiite communities, where Suleimani was seen as a champion in the face of Sunni aggression, there were expressions of grief, anger and resolve. \u201cThe blood of the martyrs... is not just Iranian or Iraqi but belongs to the Muslim community and to free men around the world,\u201d said a Huthi official in Sanaa, the Yemeni capital held by the Iran-backed militia. At a mourning ceremony in the Gaza Strip Suleimani was eulogised by the militant Palestinian movement Islamic Jihad and his image was raised high in Lebanon. In Iran, Suleimani was widely regarded as a hero for his staunch defence of the country, his defeat of the IS jihadist group, and his role in the grinding 1980s conflict between Iran and Iraq. Since his death, Suleimani has been hailed as the \u201cChe Guevara of the Middle East\u201d in some quarters, but the region\u2019s schisms and fractures present a much more complex picture. \u201cThey\u2019re packaging Suleimani as this foreign policy guru, martyr, strategist... away from the narrative that he was a terrorist and responsible for loss of life,\u201d said Sanam Vakil from the London-based Chatham House. Iran is believed to have deliberately sought to avoid US military casualties in last night\u2019s missile strikes on bases housing American troops in Iraq, according to US and European government sources familiar with intelligence assessments, Reuters writes moments ago. The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said on Wednesday the Iranians were thought to have targeted the attacks to miss US forces, in order to prevent the crisis from escalating out of control, while still sending a message of Iranian resolve. A source in Washington said overnight that early indications were of no US casualties, while other US officials declined comment. US Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, speaking in the chamber on Capitol Hill moments ago communicated a relatively cautious message, following the Iranian missile strikes last night and ahead of Donald Trump\u2019s plan to address the nation on television at the top of the hour. \u201cI was troubled but not surprised by reports that Iran fired ballistic missiles at US forced,\u201d he said, of the strikes within Iraq. He said the Iranian threat \u201chad been growing for years\u201d and noted: \u201cIt will continue even beyond the death of Iran\u2019s master terrorist Qassem Suleimani. We must remain vigilant.\u201d He pointed out that \u201capparently\u201d there had been no injuries or deaths as a result of the strikes last night. \u201cBut they demonstrated progress Iran has made...towards a large and long-range missile force.\u201d McConnell then added that the strikes were \u201ca stark reminder that Iran and its proxies have been a cancer on Iraqi sovereignty and politics for a long time.\u201d Senior Democrats have been expressing concern about the lack of information coming from the Trump administration about the standoff with Iran, and have called on officials in the Defense department to provide regular briefings and documents to Congress. \u201cWhile recognizing the need for operations security, we similarly believe there is a requirement to be transparent with the American people about how many troops this Administration plans to deploy in support of contingency plans,\u201d Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and other senior Democrats wrote in a letter on Wednesday. The Democrats also expressed grave concern over Trump\u2019s recent comments on targeting Iranian cultural sites, and asked for clarification. They said they expected a response by Friday. The Pentagon has contradicted Trump, saying cultural sites would not be a target. US secretary of defense Mark Esper acknowledged that such an attack is against international law and would be considered a war crime, adding: \u201cWe will follow the laws of armed conflict.\u201d The Iranian strikes on Iraqi bases last night appear to have been carefully designed to avoid US casualties, and may offer both sides a pathway out of the standoff, the Guardian\u2019s Michael Safi writes: The Iranian strikes were heavy on symbolism. The missiles were launched around 1.30am in Iraq, roughly the same time as the drone strike that killed Suleimani outside Baghdad\u2019s airport on Friday morning. The first projectiles struck their targets shortly after the Iranian general\u2019s coffin was lowered into the ground in the city of Kerman. The Revolutionary Guards called the operation \u201cMartyr Suleimani\u201d. They distributed videos of the missiles being launched to be broadcast across Iranian media. Despite this theatricality, the attacks appear to have been carefully designed to avoid US casualties: fired at bases that were already on high alert and so far registering no confirmed deaths. Adel Abdul Mahdi, the Iraqi prime minister, said he was forewarned of the attacks as they were imminent, and passed the alert to troops stationed at the base. Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said the strikes were characterised as self-defence and within the boundaries of international law, not the first shots in a war. He added the attacks had now concluded. Even the hardline Revolutionary Guards said in a statement that they considered this round of overt hostilities to be over if the US declined to respond. This presents an opportunity for Trump that the US president appears to have recognised. Far from the over-the-top warnings he issued in recent days, he used his first comments after the unprecedented attack to play it down. Here\u2019s a summary of where events stand so far today: Iran launched more than a dozen missiles at Iraqi bases hosting US and coalition troops overnight, declaring the strikes to be retaliation for the killing last week of the senior Iranian general Qassem Suleimani. You can read the full report here. Iranian officials initially told state media, without presenting evidence, that at least 80 US personnel had been killed or injured in the strikes, but President Donald Trump tweeted that casualty assessments were underway but \u201cso far, so good\u201d. He is expected to make a statement at 11am ET this morning. The Iraqi prime minister\u2019s office said it had received a verbal message from the Iranians shortly after midnight saying that their \u201cresponse to the assassination of the martyr Qassem Soleimani had begun or would start shortly\u201d and would be limited to US military stationed in Iraq. At the same time, they were informed by the Americans that strikes had begun against US forces at various locations in the country. Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, described the bombings as \u201ca slap in the face\u201d for the US but warned that Tehran still had a wider goal of expelling its enemy from the region. He told an audience in the city of Qom: We just gave [the US] a slap in the face last night. But that is not equivalent to what they did. International leaders have called on both sides to refrain from further violence. EU commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said \u201cthe use of weapons must stop now to give space for dialogue\u201d. Meanwhile, a passenger plane bound for the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, has crashed a few minutes after taking off from Tehran\u2019s main international airport, killing 176 people. Iran\u2019s Red Crescent said there was no chance of finding survivors, and Pir Hossein Kulivand, an Iranian emergency official, later told state TV all those onboard had been killed. Iran has said it will not hand over the black box of the plane \u2013 which contains vital records of how the tragedy occurred \u2013 to Boeing. The White House has said Trump will deliver an address at 11am EST (4pm GMT) following the Iranian attacks on Iraqi military bases housing US troops Welcome to the Guardian\u2019s US politics live blog, where we\u2019ll be focused on the latest developments on the fallout from the Iranian missile attack on US forces in Iraq last night. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has condemned Iran\u2019s missile strike, and has urged Iran to refrain from further violence. European leaders have pleaded in public and in private with the Trump administration on Wednesday to draw a line in its conflict with Iran, and not to respond militarily to Iran\u2019s \u201cretaliatory\u201d missile attack, which came days after the US drone strike in Iraq that killed Iranian general Qassem Suleimani. Meanwhile, Donald Trump is expected to address the public on TV this morning about the Iran crisis. The time has not yet been specified. In other US politics news, the impeachment process for bringing Trump to trial before the Senate is in suspended animation this morning. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had to break off from briefing her caucus of Democrats on Capitol Hill, when they had expected to hear details about the next step in impeachment, last night, after the Iranian missiles were launched. There is no indication yet of when she intends to deliver the articles of impeachment (aka congressional charges against the president) to the Senate. The Republican-controlled Senate appears intent on attempting to barrel through with the eventual trial without any witnesses being allowed.",

          "bodyText": "Iran\u2019s aviation authority has said it will not hand over flight recorders from the Ukraine International Airlines Boeing 737-800 plane that crashed moments after takeoff from Tehran, killing all 176 passengers and crew onboard, either to the aircraft\u2019s manufacturer or US aviation authorities. The statement was issued on Wednesday as the leaders of Ukraine and Canada, from which dozens of citizens died, vowed to identify the cause of the crash amid contradictory statements and swirling speculation. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said: \u201cOur government will continue to work closely with its international partners to ensure that \u2026 [the crash] is thoroughly investigated, and that Canadians\u2019 questions are answered.\u201d The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said: \u201cOur priority is to establish the truth and those responsible for this terrible catastrophe.\u201d Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister, Vadym Prystaiko, said there were 82 Iranians, 63 Canadians and 11 Ukrainians on board. The Ukrainian nationals included two passengers and the nine crew. There were also 10 Swedish passengers, four Afghans, three Germans and three British nationals, he said. The announcement by Iran\u2019s Civil Aviation Organisation head, Ali Abedzadeh, followed the launch of an urgent inquiry into the crash by the Ukrainian government, which rowed back on an earlier statement ruling out a terrorist act. The developments have fuelled uncertainty over the circumstances of the crash, which occurred hours after Iran had fired a volley of missiles at bases used by US forces in neighbouring Iraq, in retaliation for the assassination of the Iranian general Qassem Suleimani in Baghdad by the US. Speaking after the black box flight recorders were found at the crash site, Abedzadeh said: \u201cWe will not give the black boxes to the manufacturer and the Americans. It\u2019s not yet clear which country the black box will go to for the investigation. \u201cThis accident will be investigated by Iran\u2019s aviation organisation, but the Ukrainians can also be present during the incident\u2019s investigation.\u201d The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, called for complete cooperation with any investigation and said the US was prepared to offer Ukraine all possible assistance in identifying the cause of the crash. Journalists at the site described farmland covered with debris. The dead lay among shattered pieces of the aircraft, and their possessions \u2013 including a child\u2019s electric toothbrush, a stuffed animal, luggage and electronics \u2013 were strewn across the site. Iran\u2019s insistence that it will not hand over the black boxes to Boeing comes amid claims that at least two aircraft which had been originally routed through Iranian airspace around the time of the Iranian missile attacks on the bases in Iraq were either told to turn around or redirected. The Ukraine International Airlines flight PS752 disappeared from flight trackers a few minutes after its delayed takeoff from Tehran, apparently suffering a catastrophic incident that caused it to break up in flames over farmland outside the city with crew unable to issue a mayday alert. Amateur video, allegedly capturing the plane\u2019s final moments, appeared to show a brightly burning object in the sky, breaking into pieces before exploding in orange flames on the horizon. The video was published on the website of the state-run Iranian Students News Agency, which also carried a photograph of section of wing from the crashed aircraft, which some analysts said appeared to show penetration damage. Ukraine International Airlines said it had indefinitely suspended flights to Tehran after the crash, amid announcements from a slew of other international airlines that they would be avoiding Iranian and Iraqi airspace following the escalating tensions between the US and Iran. \u201cIt was one of the best planes we had, with an amazing, reliable crew,\u201d Yevheniy Dykhne, the president of Ukraine International Airlines, said at a briefing following the crash. As the investigation got under way, the aviation safety information-sharing website OpsGroup, which was set up following the shooting down of Malaysian airlines flight MH17 over Ukraine in 2014, urged airline operators to err on the side of caution until the cause of the crash had been established and work on the assumption the plane had been shot down. Under the rules of the International Civil Aviation Organisation, of which Iran, Ukraine and the US are all members, air crash investigations are led by the country where the accident occurred. Iranian officials said they suspected a mechanical issue brought down the three-and-a-half-year-old Boeing 737-800, an assessment Ukrainian officials initially agreed with but later backed away from while the investigation is ongoing. Justin Bronk, a research fellow at the Royal United Service Institute, said that he believed on balance the incident was \u201ca tragic coincidence\u201d. He said it would require a fairly large surface-to-air missile to inflict such catastrophic damage on a civilian airliner, \u201cbut there was no evidence of a rocket plume\u201d in the videos that have emerged so far. \u201cIt would also be very hard to conceal such a large rocket battery from the ground,\u201d he added. Amid speculation about the cause of the crash, the third in recent months involving a Boeing passenger aircraft, civil aviation insiders also pointed to the large debris field to suggest the plane had broken up suddenly in midair. The 737-800 belongs to the same family as, but is different from, the 737 Max 8 aircraft, which has been grounded since two fatal crashes occurred within six months in Indonesia and Ethiopia in 2018. The 737-800 operates with a different software system to the one implicated in the Max 8 crashes. The plane had been last serviced two days before the accident, according to the airline. An investigation team was deployed to the site of the crash on the south-western outskirts of Tehran on Wednesday morning, said Reza Jafarzadeh, a civil aviation spokesman. Qassem Biniaz, a spokesman for Iran\u2019s road and transportation ministry, told the state-run Irna news agency it appeared the pilot had lost control after a fire struck one of the plane\u2019s engines. Hassan Rezaeifar, the head of the air crash investigation committee, said it appeared the pilot could not communicate with air traffic controllers in Tehran in the last moments of the flight. He did not provide further details. Zelenskiy, who cut short a visit to Oman following the crash, ordered an investigation and a sweeping check of \u201call civilian aircraft\u201d in Ukraine. \u201cOur task is to establish the cause of the crash of the Boeing and provide all necessary help to the families of the victims,\u201d Dmytro Razumkov, the speaker of the Ukrainian parliament, said in a statement on Facebook. The UK Foreign Office said it was urgently seeking confirmation about how many British nationals were onboard, and would do all it could to support any families affected. One witness, Aref Geravand, told AP the pilot managed to steer the plane towards a football field and away from a residential area, saying: \u201cIt crashed near the field and in a water canal.\u201d",
