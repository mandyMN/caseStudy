Behind the scenes, however, one group has been quietly refining a precedent-setting proposal that they say offers a means of protecting indigenous rights while unlocking the country\u2019s vast oil and gas reserves: a First Nations-led pipeline. \u201cWe did this because First Nations wanted to be able to demonstrate how to do this right,\u201d said Calvin Helin, the chairman and president of Eagle Spirit Energy Holdings and a member of the Lax Kw\u2019alaams band on Canada\u2019s west coast. Six years in the making, plans for the Eagle Spirit pipeline envision transporting up to 2m barrels a day of medium to heavy crude oil from Alberta\u2019s landlocked oil sands to tide water on the west coast.

Indigenous peoples have been at the forefront of protests against pipelines across North America, whether it be the Dakota Access oil pipeline or the Trans Mountain Expansion. In 2016, about 50 aboriginal groups came together in Canada and the US to sign a treaty to jointly fight any proposal for pipelines, tanker or rail projects that would carry crude from Alberta\u2019s oil sands. Helin pointed to the wider picture. \u201cThe thing that is lost is that each First Nation has the right to decide what it wants to do within its own traditional territory \u2013 I have no right to say what goes in their territory,\u201d he said.

Downing Street has said Britain will push for tougher sanctions against Russia \u2013 and tougher enforcement of the existing regime \u2013 to increase pressure on the Kremlin.

Much to the visible annoyance of Raab, some MPs on the committee were more interested in hearing from Robbins than from Raab. This committee, which until Brexit used to be one of the most obscure in parliament, has always attracted a disproportion share of hardline Eurosceptics, and amongst Brexiters Robbins is something of a hate figure; they suspect him of fighting a behind-the-scenes campaign to make Brexit as soft as possible. But Robbins managed to dead-bat the hostile questions quite easily, and most of the news came from Raab, although it was an MP on the committee who probably produced the best line.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, told a private meeting that the Chequers plans were \u201cmortes [dead]\u201d, the MPs were told.</strong> Barnier met the Commons Brexit committee in Brussels on Monday.

And a Russian-made missile, launched from territory held by Russian-backed separatists, brought down MH17. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong><em>On further action being taken against Russia</em></strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Mr Speaker, our allies acted in good faith - and the painstaking work of our police and intelligence agencies over the last six months further reinforces that they were right to do so.</p> <p>Together, we will continue to show that those who attempt to undermine the international rules based system cannot act with impunity.</p> <p>We will continue to press for all of the measures agreed so far to be fully implemented, including the creation of a new EU Chemical Weapons sanctions regime.</p> <p>But we will not stop there.</p> <p>We will also push for new EU sanctions regimes against those responsible for cyber-attacks and gross human rights violations - and for new listings under the existing regime against Russia.</p> <p>And we will work with our partners to empower the OPCW to attribute chemical weapons attacks to other states beyond Syria.</p> <p>Most significantly, Mr Speaker, what we have learnt from today\u2019s announcement is the specific nature of the threat from the Russian GRU.</p> <p>We know that the GRU has played a key part in malign Russian activity in recent years.</p> <p>And today we have exposed their role behind the despicable chemical weapons attack on the streets of Salisbury.</p> <p>The actions of the GRU are a threat to all our allies and to all our citizens.</p> <p>And on the basis of what we have learnt in the Salisbury investigation - and what we know about this organisation more broadly - we must now step up our collective efforts, specifically against the GRU.We are increasing our understanding of what the GRU is doing in our countries, shining a light on their activities, exposing their methods and sharing them with our allies, just as we have done with Salisbury.</p> <p>And, Mr Speaker, while the House will appreciate that I cannot go into details, together with our allies we will deploy the full range of tools from across our National Security apparatus in order to counter the threat posed by the GRU.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b8fcc10e4b016e2560e424f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-09-05T12:31:01.433Z\">1.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Labour MP <strong>Pat McFadden </strong>says the first duty of any PM is to protect the public and to be clear-eyed about the threat the country faces. </p> <p>That sounded like a clear jibe at Corbyn.</p> <p>McFadden goes on to ask why the government thinks Russia launched this attack.</p> <p>May thanks McFadden for his comment.

Today he devoted all six questions to it, he made it look easy and he won quite comfortably. It is not hard to see why; you could probably use the number of Brexit questions Corbyn asks each month as a reliable index for the success of the Brexit talks, and Corbyn was good today because he neatly highlighted the very real concerns that Theresa May\u2019s strategy, and her decision to bet her administration on a plan rejected by much of her party and the EU, is driving the UK towards a no deal Brexit. His questions weren\u2019t flashy or profound, but they were effective. He used contrasting quotes to highlight cabinet divisions on this issue, he gently mocked Dominic Raab\u2019s claim that a no deal Brexit would have certain advantages (so does death, I suppose, or the bubonic plague) and, quoting people as diverse as the NFU and Mervyn King, he articulated the genuine concerns about what would happen if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. On another day May\u2019s counter-thrust on antisemitism might have resonated, but today it just felt irrelevant. And, with the chances of a no deal Brexit increasing, her attempt to weaponise the second referendum argument did not work either. Corbyn is still officially sceptical about a second referendum, but the questions he asked went some way to justify his decision not to indulge May by ruling one out.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b8fba21e4b0bbf6e9164758\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-09-05T11:16:23.102Z\">12.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Corbyn says the NFU says a no deal Brexit would be armageddon, the TUC says it would be devastating for working people, and EU leaders have ruled it out.

On Saturday they conducted what the police describe as a \u201creconnaissance\u201d trip to Salisbury. He goes on:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On Sunday, 4 March, they made the same journey from the hotel, again using the underground from Bow to Waterloo station at approximately 8.05am, before continuing their journey by train to Salisbury.</p> <p>CCTV shows them in the vicinity of Mr Skripal\u2019s house and we believe that they contaminated the front door with novichok.</p> <p>They left Salisbury and returned to Waterloo Station, arriving at approximately 4.45pm and boarded the London Underground at approximately 6.30pm to London Heathrow Airport.</p> <p>From Heathrow Airport, they returned to Moscow on Aeroflot flight SU2585, departing at 10.30pm on Sunday, 4 March.</p> <p>We have no evidence that they re-entered the UK after that date.</p> <p>Having taken advice from Public Health England, we are confident that there was no risk to members of the public who were on the same flight, trains or public transport used by the suspects.</p> <p>On 4 May 2018, tests were carried out in the hotel room where the suspects had stayed. A number of samples were tested at DSTL at Porton Down. Two swabs showed contamination of novichok at levels below that which would cause concern for public health. A decision was made to take further samples from the room as a precautionary measure, including in the same areas originally tested, and all results came back negative. We believe the first process of taking swabs removed the contamination, so low were the traces of novichok in the room.</p> <p>Following these tests, experts deemed the room was safe and that it posed no risk to the public.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He says the police are releasing various images of the two Russians, travelling under the names. Alexander Petrov and Rusian Boshirov.</strong> He asks members of the public who saw them to get in touch.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He urges anyone who stayed at the City Stay Hotel between 4 March and 4 May to get in touch, although he says their health does not seem to be at risk.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The levels of novichok we found in the room at the time of police sampling in May were such that they were not enough to cause short or long-term health effects to anyone exposed to it, at that point or thereafter. We will continue to work closely with Public Health England as new information comes to light.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He says the poisoning of Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley is linked to the attack on the Skripals and he explains why.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Our rationale for linking the two investigations is primarily based on the following four facts:</p> <p>Firstly, our own analysis, and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in the Hague, has confirmed that the same type of novichok was used in both cases.</p> <p>Secondly, the nerve agent is one of the rarest chemical warfare agents in the world and its discovery, twice, in such close proximity is beyond a coincidence.</p> <p>Third, the manner in which the bottle and packaging has been adapted makes it a perfect cover for smuggling the weapon into the country, and a perfect delivery method for the attack against the Skripal\u2019s front door.</p> <p>Fourthly, the lack of crossover between the known movements of the suspects and Dawn and Charlie\u2019s known movements around Salisbury, and the fact that there is no evidence to suggest they have been targeted mean it is much more likely Dawn and Charlie found.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He explains how Sturgess and Rowley came to be poisoned.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Charlie told police he found a box he thought contained perfume in a charity bin on Wednesday, 27 June. Inside the box was a bottle and applicator. He tried to put the two parts together at his home address on Saturday, 30 June, and in doing so got some of the contents on himself. He said Dawn had applied some of the substance to her wrists before feeling unwell.</p> <p>After Charlie told police where he found the box, cordons were put in place and two bins behind shops in Catherine Street, Salisbury, were removed.</p> <p>Previously, during a search of Charlie\u2019s home address in Muggleton Road on 10 July a small box labelled as Nina Ricci Premier Jour was recovered from a rubbish bag in the kitchen. On 11 July a small glass bottle with a modified nozzle was found on a kitchen worktop. Tests undertaken at DSTL established the bottle contained a significant amount of novichok.</p> <p>We have carried out numerous inquiries in relation to the bottle and are now able to release an image of it with the nozzle attached. We are also releasing an image of the box that the bottle and nozzle were in.</p> <p>We have spoken to Nina Ricci and undertaken further inquiries. Nina Ricci and our inquiries have confirmed that it is not a genuine Nina Ricci perfume bottle, box or nozzle. It is in fact a counterfeit box, bottle and nozzle that have been especially adapted. I\u2019d like to reassure anyone who has bought Nina Ricci perfume from a legitimate source that they should not be concerned. It is safe.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6a6d0612fd2b1960d292eb7c32ab7ae9353690d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a6d0612fd2b1960d292eb7c32ab7ae9353690d1/56_0_867_520/500.png\" alt=\"Neil Basu\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Neil Basu</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sky News</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b8faec4e4b0674f1f42ad69\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-09-05T10:26:45.562Z\">11.26am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Metropolitan police has now published <a href=\"http://news.met.police.uk/news/counter-terrorism-police-release-images-of-two-suspects-in-connection-with-salisbury-attack-320534\">the full text</a> of a lengthy statement by <strong>Neil Basu,</strong> its national lead on counter terrorism, about the evidence against the two Russians accused of being responsible for the novichok attack in Salisbury in March. </p> <p>I will publish highlights shortly.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b8fab08e4b0b3198af4d690\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-09-05T10:20:38.614Z\">11.20am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is the statement from <strong>Sue Hemming</strong>, CPS director of legal services, about the decision to identify two Russian suspects in the novichok case.

But he says people who now think Brexit won\u2019t have the economic advantages or disadvantages claimed in 2016 are shifting their views.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Over 90% of those voters who voted Remain in June 2016 and who think that Britain\u2019s economy will get worse as a result of Brexit say that they would vote the same way again in a second referendum. Equally, over 90% of those who backed Leave two years ago and who think the economy will be better off in the wake of Brexit state that they would vote Leave again. In short, hardly anyone who endorses \u2018their\u2019 side\u2019s economic argument has changed their mind.</p> <p>However, these figures fall off quite markedly among those who take a different view of the economics of Brexit. Only around three-quarters of those Remain voters who think that leaving the EU will not make much difference to the economy say they would vote Remain again, while the equivalent figure among Leave voters is much the same. Meanwhile, less than half of those Remain voters who are now of the view that Britain\u2019s economy will be better off as a result of Brexit would vote the same way, while the same is true of Leave supporters who believe the economy will be worse off.</p> </blockquote> <p>This could have consequences later, Curtice argues.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the midst of the doubtless sometimes fierce arguments in the coming weeks about what should and should not form part of the Brexit agreement and how well or badly the government (and the EU) are handling the negotiations, we should bear in mind that it is what voters make of the economics of whatever deal is reached that is most likely to determine whether, at the conclusion of the negotiations, a majority of them still want to leave the EU or whether the balance of opinion has swung in the opposite direction.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b8f9ffae4b01f9ae49efae6\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/lisaocarroll\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-09-05T09:24:33.437Z\">10.24am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Food shortages in UK 'not inconceivable' under no deal Brexit, says food company boss</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The chief executive of Britain\u2019s third biggest food company has thrown its weight behind Theresa May\u2019s Chequers proposal saying it is a \u201cpretty satisfactory\u201d way to solve the Brexit challenges.</p> <p><strong>Patrick Coveney</strong>, who is also brother of Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister Simon Coveney, said it would be tough to get through because it was under attack from all sides, but said there were no other plans on the table.

          "bodyText": "Here are the main points from the evidence given by Dominic Raab, the Brexit secretary, and Olly Robbins, the prime minister\u2019s chief Brexit adviser, to the European scrutiny committee. Much to the visible annoyance of Raab, some MPs on the committee were more interested in hearing from Robbins than from Raab. This committee, which until Brexit used to be one of the most obscure in parliament, has always attracted a disproportion share of hardline Eurosceptics, and amongst Brexiters Robbins is something of a hate figure; they suspect him of fighting a behind-the-scenes campaign to make Brexit as soft as possible. But Robbins managed to dead-bat the hostile questions quite easily, and most of the news came from Raab, although it was an MP on the committee who probably produced the best line. Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, told a private meeting that the Chequers plans were \u201cmortes [dead]\u201d, the MPs were told. Barnier met the Commons Brexit committee in Brussels on Monday. Several MPs have already said that Barnier described the Chequers plans as unacceptable, but Stephen Kinnock, a member of the Brexit committee and the European scrutiny committee, this afternoon came out with the exact phrase he says he thought Barnier used: \u201cLes propositions sont mortes.\u201d (See 4.07pm.) Raab said that he would not take Kinnock\u2019s word for it and that he wanted to hear from Barnier himself. He will get a chance tomorrow. Robbins said that the cabinet did not discuss the plan for a common rulebook on goods with the EU until the Chequers meeting at which the white paper was agreed. \u201cIt was the first time that the Cabinet had discussed it, yes,\u201d he said. The BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg says this supports Brexiter suspicions that Theresa May was bouncing her ministers into backing her plans. Stewart Jackson, the Brexiter former Tory MP who served as David Davis\u2019s chief of staff when Davis was Brexit secretary, re-stated that charge this afternoon. Raab said the UK could strike \u201cno deal deals\u201d with the EU, covering certain issues, in the event of there being no overall deal. (See 4.40pm.) Raab brushed aside claims from Conservatives on the committee that the Chequers planned was doomed. Sir Bill Cash, the Brexiter chairman, said the government should put the Chequers plan \u201cout of its misery\u201d. And David Jones, a former Brexit minister, told Raab he was \u201cflogging a deal horse\u201d by arguing for Chequers. Raab replied to Jones: This is a negotiation with the EU so you are going to hear noises from various sides that are critical. That is an inherent part of a sensitive, contentious negotiation like this but you should be in no doubt that we are making good progress. Raab said that a Canada-style trade deal - the option favoured by hardline Tory Brexiters - would be unacceptable because it would involve the UK having to accept the Northern Ireland backstop, potentially for good. He said: The suggestion that has been made [that the UK should accept the Canada-style deal being offered by the EU] - I think you need to accept the small print of the offer that is being made in relation to the appendage of the backstop the EU is proposing, which ultimately would involve a limbo period to be determined ... which could proceed indefinitely. He said some in the EU were using the Irish border issue to put pressure on the UK. He said: There are clearly some in some quarters of the EU who appreciate this is a political pressure point on the UK. And this is a negotiation, people apply pressure points and I think you are right about that. Two Brexiter MPs on the committee, Kate Hoey and Richard Drax, told Raab they thought the difficulties posed by the Irish border were being exaggerated. Drax said the issue had been \u201cblown out of all proportion\u201d and Hoey said the problem was \u201cridiculously over-hyped\u201d. Raab did not accept their arguments, saying he saw it as a genuine problem. Robbins hinted that some aspects of the Chequers plan may have been discussed with the EU before being presented to the cabinet. As the Sun\u2019s Harry Cole says, this is likely to annoy Brexiters. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Asked about the Bloomberg report suggesting that Britain and Germany are happy to accept a Brexit deal that is vague about the future relationship (see 3.52pm), the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said: We have always set out that when parliament votes on this, it needs to be a meaningful vote based on proper information. We have always been clear that parliament needs to be able to make an informed decision, and parliament has also been clear on that. There is no change in that position. There will be a UN security council meeting on Thursday for the UK to update other nations on the latest Salisbury investigations, Theresa May\u2019s spokesman told the afternoon lobby briefing. May has also discussed the developments with the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, he said. In other diplomatic moves, the Russian charges d\u2019affaires in London \u2013 diplomatic-speak for the deputy ambassador \u2013 has been summoned to the Foreign Office to, as the spokesman said, \u201caccount for the actions of the GRU\u201d. It was the charges d\u2019affaires called in as the ambassador is not currently in the UK, we were told. The Parliament TV live feed from the committee has cut off. But they were about to finish, and there is now a division in the Commons (meaning it would have to suspend anyway), and so it is probably save to assume it\u2019s over. I will post a summary soon. Labour\u2019s Geraint Davies asks for an assurance that no diabetics will die because of a shortage of insulin after a no deal Brexit. Raab says that sort of scaremongering is not worthy of the committee. But he says the government has plans to ensure there are supplies of medicine. Q: People did not vote for a no deal Brexit. So will you accept that, if we are heading for a no deal Brexit, they should get a vote? Raab says he will not. If that is what Labour wanted, it should have backed an amendment to that effect when the EU withdrawal bill was in the Commons. He says he agrees with the warnings from Barry Gardiner, the international trade secretary, about how having a second referendum could lead to unrest. David Jones asks Raab why he is \u201cflogging a dead horse\u201d and pushing Chequers when so many MPs are opposed to it. Raab says he does not accept that analysis. He says, when MPs are faced with a binary choice, things will look different. Raab says, when one side in a negotiation complains to the media, that is normally a sign they are under pressure. He says he will not accept Stephen Kinnock\u2019s version of what Michel Barnier. Raab says there are three types of action that the UK could take with the EU in the event of there being no deal. The two sides could just coordinate what they do, without a legal agreement; there could be MoUs (memorandums of understanding); or there could be more formal agreements, he says. David Jones, the Conservative former Brexit minister, goes next. Q: David Davis, the former Brexit secretary, said that if there was no over-arching deal, there would still be mini deals on particular issues. Is that still the government\u2019s expectation? Raab says that is a good question. He does not want to talk up the prospects of no deal, he says. But, if there were to be no deal, there would be various mitigating things the government could do. You could have MoUs (memorandums of understanding). Or there could be no deal deals, he says. He says the government has discussed this with the European commission. Some of these things would require the agreement of the other side. Raab says there could be \u201cno deal deals\u201d with the EU in some areas if the Brexit negotiations break down. Q: Are these talks happening already? In some areas, such as those involving the Bank of England, yes, they are, says Raab. Q: Given the revelations about Vote Leave breaking election spending rules, are you embarrassed to be involved in such disastrous decisions based on illegality? Raab says there have been allegations about both sides. Labour\u2019s Darren Jones goes next. Q: How much of the future partnership is agreed? Raab says the \u201880% agreed\u2019 figure applies to the withdrawal agreement. He says he could not put a figure on how much of the future partnership is agreed, but he said on the security aspects they are in \u201ca good place\u201d. And he refers to what Michel Barnier said about this in his statement on Friday. Here is the key quote from Barnier. On internal security, we are ready to build an ambitious partnership with the United Kingdom, which will become a third country, as was its wish, outside of Schengen. In keeping with the European council guidelines, this partnership would consist of four pillars: the effective exchange of information; the support for law enforcement cooperation; judicial cooperation in criminal matters; and an ambitious partnership to combat money laundering and terrorism financing. The UK\u2019s white paper contains, I would like to repeat, positive guarantees on the protection of fundamental rights and the recognition of the European court of justice as the ultimate arbiter of EU law. But we need to now discuss how to translate these guarantees concretely. Subject to full reciprocity and guarantees on procedural rights for suspects, we now have the elements to build a close and effective relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom on several subjects which are very important for citizens: a framework for extradition mechanisms; reciprocal cooperation on airplane passenger data to better trace and identify the individuals involved in terrorist acts; the exchange of DNA data, fingerprints and vehicle data. Kelvin Hopkins, the independent MP (because he is suspended from Labour), goes next. Q: If the EU does not comply with the agreement, will the UK stop paying the \u00a340bn? Raab says he is confident the UK will get a good deal. He will not go into a deal-making process \u201cexpecting one side to welch\u201d. Kinnock repeats his points about Barnier saying the Chequers deal was \u201cdead in the water\u201d. Raab asks Kinnock if that is what Barnier said, or if that is Kinnock\u2019s summary. Kinnock says Barnier was speaking in French. He says the transcript will be published in due course. He says he thinks he heard Barnier say something like: \u201cLes propositions sont mortes.\u201d Raab says some of the concern raised by the EU reflects their worry that the UK could have a competitive advantage after Brexit. That should give MPs confidence, he says. Labour\u2019s Stephen Kinnock goes next. Kinnock also sits on the Commons Brexit committee, and he said that when that committee met Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, in Brussels on Monday, Barnier made it \u201ccrystal clear\u201d that the Chequers plan was unacceptable. What is plan B? Raab says in an negotiation of course one side wants to push back against what it\u2019s offered. He says MPs should not let themselves be used by the other side. Robbins says Barnier says the EU is opposed to allowing the UK to collect tariffs on its behalf. Yet it does accept this in its plan for the Northern Irish backstop. He says the UK is trying to tease out why the EU finds this objectionable. Barnier also claims that you cannot distinguish between goods and services because services make up a large part of the value of goods now. He says services can be regulated separately. If a vehicle comes with a maintenance package, a buyer could choose not to accept that package. The other point is that service expertise contributes to the value of new goods. But Robbins says this factor has not stopped the EU reaching trade deals, like the one with Canada, focusing on goods. According to Bloomberg, the UK and Germany have both dropped their demand that the Brexit withdrawal agreement must contain a detailed plan for the future trade relationship. In other words, they are more included to accept a fudge - or a \u201cblind Brexit\u201d, as some call it. Bloomberg says the pound rose in value when this was reported. Here is an excerpt from the Bloomberg story. Germany is ready to accept a less detailed agreement on the U.K.\u2019s future economic and trade ties with the EU in a bid to get a Brexit deal done, according to people speaking on condition of anonymity because the discussions are private. The U.K. side is also willing to settle for a vaguer statement of intent on the future relationship, postponing some decisions until after Brexit day, according to an official who declined to be named ... Initially, both sides wanted a detailed outline of what the future relationship would look like as part of the first stage. Negotiators in the U.K. and EU were once planning a document of up to 100 pages; now it could be just a 10th of that, officials say. The pound rose on the news, trading 0.9 percent higher at $1.2970 at 2:18 p.m. in London. Raab says that, if the UK was not bound by a common rulebook for goods, it would have more flexibility to offer concessions to other countries in trade deals. Q: Do you expect the full future relationship to be agreed by next March? Raab says he expects heads of agreement to be agreed by March. But he says he hopes it will look like an instruction to negotiators. It should very clear about the choices being made. He says MPs would not be happy about signing up to a withdrawal agreement if it is \u201cnebulous and unclear\u201d about the final destination. He says he wants this in place by the time of the EU summit in October. But there may be a \u201cmodicum of leeway\u201d, he says. The SNP\u2019s Philippa Whitford asks about the amendment passed in the Commons saying the UK cannot collect tariffs on behalf of the EU unless that is reciprocated. Raab says the government is confident the white paper plans are consistent with the amendment. He says there is a difference between tariffs being paid up front and remittances being paid at a later stage. Q: But clause 54 in the customs bill will make it unlawful. Raab says the government has looked at this carefully and taken legal advice. He says the white paper plans would be lawful under the amendment. Raab says the implementation period, at 21 months, will be \u201cmuch shorter\u201d than many people feared. He says the UK could not agree to remain in a backstop situation for a \u201climbo period\u201d. Here is the Economist\u2019s Brexit editor John Peet on the hearing so far. Briefing journalists after the Salisbury statement, Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s official spokesman gave a robust defence of the Labour leader\u2019s approach in March, when the PM first attributed the attack to Russia, and some Labour MPs condemned their leader\u2019s response as lacklustre. \u201cJeremy took a proportionate, evidence-based approach to what took place, which was the right approach, and it\u2019s been a step-by-step approach ever since,\u201d he said. Corbyn received a briefing from the security forces on Wednesday morning, and his spokesman said it had now become clear that the Russian state was directly involved in the attack. \u201cIt\u2019s clear now that very strong evidence points to Russian state culpability, and obviously Jeremy condemns the Russian state for that culpability\u201d, he said. He pointed to Corbyn\u2019s remarks in the House that Labour would support \u201creasonable and effective action,\u201d against Russia, adding that the most effective approach would be, \u201cfinancial action against the use of London by the oligarchs linked to the Russian state\u201d. Asked about remarks six months ago comparing the Salisbury situation to the claims about weapons of mass destruction (WMD) made in the run-up to the Iraq war, the spokesman said Labour\u2019s point then had been \u201cas much about the political use of the intelligence, as the intelligence itself\u201d. Robbins says he has had very difficult conversations with Irish officials where he has said that what the EU put forward on the Irish border backstop earlier this year took very little account of the realities of British politics. Q: [To Raab] Do you understand why so many people are surprised the Irish border is such a big issue, given the fact that a border between the Republic and Northern Ireland operates already? Do you agree some people are using this to make Brexit seem as difficult as possible? Raab says there are different views as to how intractable this issue is. He says he sees it as genuine issue that needs to be resolved. But he says he thinks some in the EU are using this as a \u201cpressure point\u201d. Raab some some in the EU are using the Irish border issue as a \u201cpressure point\u201d in the Brexit negotiations. Labour\u2019s Kate Hoey, a Brexiter, goes next. She asks Robbins if he has visited Northern Ireland in his capacity as Brexit adviser. He says he has been to Dublin but not to Belfast. Raab says he hopes people critical of the Chequers plan will apply the same scrutiny to alternative plans. He says those advocating a Canada-style free trade deal have to explain why that would not lead to the Northern Ireland backstop arrangements staying in place for perpetuity. Raab says a Canada-style free trade deal (of the kind favoured by Tory Brexiters) would be unacceptable because of the Irish border problem. The Conservative Richard Drax goes next. He addresses Olly Robbins. Q: Are you firmly behind leaving the EU? Robbins says he is firmly behind serving the government of the day, as he has been ever since he joined the civil service. He says his personal views do not affect how he serves the government of the day. Q: Has the EU made any concessions? Raab says the EU has agreed the UK can negotiate future trade deals during the transition. And in some of the areas where agreement has been reached, the EU has made concessions. Q: We seem to have made considerable concessions, but the EU hasn\u2019t. Raab says, because of the sequencing, the UK had had to make concessions earlier. It it in the talks on the future relationship that the \u201csunny uplands\u201d beckon. He says, when the final deal is achieved, David Jones will see the \u201cbalance\u201d he is looking for. David Jones, the Conservative former Brexit minister, goes next. Q: Why did the British government agree to what the EU wanted to terms of the sequencing of the talks? Robbins says the UK agreed with the EU to start by focusing on the issues the EU wanted to discuss in phase one of the talks. Q: Wasn\u2019t that a concession? Robbins says the UK agreed on the basis that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed? Q: Hasn\u2019t the UK made a series of concessions, on the European court of justice and on money? Robbins says he and Raab agree that, under article 50, the withdrawal agreement and the future partnership will be linked. Dominic Raab, the Brexit secretary, and Olly Robbins, the prime minister\u2019s chief Brexit advisers, are now giving evidence to the Commons European scrutiny committee. Sir Bill Cash, the Tory Brexiter chair, starts by saying that Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, has effectively declared the Chequers agreement dead. Raab takes issue with that. Referring to the recent remarks from Barnier on the Chequers plan, Raab says the full transcript of what Barnier said showed that he said some positive things about it. The May statement is now over. Here are contributions from two senior MPs not mentioned already. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, said the UK should unite against Russia. There must always be robust response to the use of terror on our streets. Let me reassure the prime minister that the Scottish National party is committed to working constructively with the Government to ensure we do all we can to protect the public. And Dominic Grieve, the Conservative who chairs the intelligence and security committee, said Russia was a gangster state. [Theresa May] is absolutely right in her identification of the Russian state. What we are at the moment is the victim of state terrorism by a state which is in fact run as a gangster organisation and which threatens us all and has done it repeatedly on the international stage and is wholly outside the international rules-based system. Grieve also said it was important to consider how easily Russians could enter the country. It clearly is going to become a pertinent issue when it becomes so apparent that the system is being abused by the Russian state for the purpose of sending [hoods] and murderers to come into our country to kill our citizens and those who are protected by us. Theresa May spoke by phone with US President Donald Trump on Tuesday evening to update him on the latest development in the Salisbury investigation, the PM\u2019s official spokesman said. In the Commons May is still responding to questions. The SNP\u2019s Chris Law asks if further Russians will be deported. May says this only happens if the home secretary has the required level of evidence. This is from Tom Tugendhat, the Conservative chair of the Commons foreign affairs committee. Russia has brushed aside the allegations against its two nationals. The Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the names of the men and their photos \u201csay nothing to us.\u201d Zakharova also called on Britain to cooperate with Russian law enforcement agencies on the investigation. And she criticised London for turning down Moscow\u2019s request to see the case files. The Conservative MP Sir Desmond Swayne asks May to confirm that when she said in her statement that the Salisbury attack was \u201calmost certainly also approved outside the GRU at a senior level of the Russian state\u201d, she meant that President Putin ordered it. May says what she meant was that it was approved outside the GRU at a senior level of the Russian state. The Labour MP Chris Leslie asks May if she will condemn the \u201ccranks and ideological extremists\u201d who do not accept that Russia was to blame and who are sowing mistrust of the security services. May says she agrees. The Conservative MP John Whittingdale asks May if the cases of Russians who died on British soil are being re-investigated to see if they are suspicious. (A BuzzFeed investigation earlier this year said there were 14 deaths where murder was ruled out despite there being suspicious circumstances.) May says the home secretary will soon be writing to the Commons home affairs committee, which raised this issue. The cases were reviewed., But she says she understands the review concluded there was \u201cno cause for further consideration of those cases\u201d. May says review of 14 allegedly suspicious deaths linked to Russia has concluded there is no case for further investigation. Here are edited extracts from Theresa May\u2019s statement. Much of the first half of the statement mirrored what the Met said about its investigation in the statement issued earlier. (See 11.53pm.) The most interesting material came in the second half. On the two Russian suspects being Russian military intelligence officers We were right to say in March that the Russian State was responsible. And now we have identified the individuals involved, we can go even further. Mr Speaker, just as the police investigation has enabled the CPS to bring charges against the two suspects, so the Security and Intelligence Agencies have carried out their own investigations into the organisation behind this attack. Based on this work, I can today tell the House that, based on a body of intelligence, the Government has concluded that the two individuals named by the police and CPS are officers from the Russian military intelligence service, also known as the GRU. The GRU is a highly disciplined organisation with a well-established chain of command.So this was not a rogue operation. It was almost certainly also approved outside the GRU at a senior level of the Russian state. On steps being taken to bring the suspects to justice Let me turn to our response to this appalling attack and the further knowledge we now have about those responsible. First, with respect to the two individuals, as the Crown Prosecution Service and Police announced earlier today, we have obtained a European Arrest Warrant and will shortly issue an Interpol red notice. Of course, Russia has repeatedly refused to allow its nationals to stand trial overseas, citing a bar on extradition in its constitution. So, as we found following the murder of Alexander Litvinenko, any formal extradition request in this case would be futile.But should either of these individuals ever again travel outside Russia, we will take every possible step to detain them, to extradite them and to bring them to face justice here in the United Kingdom. On Russia\u2019s conduct generally Mr Speaker, this chemical weapons attack on our soil was part of a wider pattern of Russian behaviour that persistently seeks to undermine our security and that of our allies around the world. They have fomented conflict in the Donbas, illegally annexed Crimea, repeatedly violated the national airspace of several European countries and mounted a sustained campaign of cyber espionage and election interference. They were behind a violent attempted coup in Montenegro. And a Russian-made missile, launched from territory held by Russian-backed separatists, brought down MH17. On further action being taken against Russia Mr Speaker, our allies acted in good faith - and the painstaking work of our police and intelligence agencies over the last six months further reinforces that they were right to do so. Together, we will continue to show that those who attempt to undermine the international rules based system cannot act with impunity. We will continue to press for all of the measures agreed so far to be fully implemented, including the creation of a new EU Chemical Weapons sanctions regime. But we will not stop there. We will also push for new EU sanctions regimes against those responsible for cyber-attacks and gross human rights violations - and for new listings under the existing regime against Russia. And we will work with our partners to empower the OPCW to attribute chemical weapons attacks to other states beyond Syria. Most significantly, Mr Speaker, what we have learnt from today\u2019s announcement is the specific nature of the threat from the Russian GRU. We know that the GRU has played a key part in malign Russian activity in recent years. And today we have exposed their role behind the despicable chemical weapons attack on the streets of Salisbury. The actions of the GRU are a threat to all our allies and to all our citizens. And on the basis of what we have learnt in the Salisbury investigation - and what we know about this organisation more broadly - we must now step up our collective efforts, specifically against the GRU.We are increasing our understanding of what the GRU is doing in our countries, shining a light on their activities, exposing their methods and sharing them with our allies, just as we have done with Salisbury. And, Mr Speaker, while the House will appreciate that I cannot go into details, together with our allies we will deploy the full range of tools from across our National Security apparatus in order to counter the threat posed by the GRU. The Labour MP Pat McFadden says the first duty of any PM is to protect the public and to be clear-eyed about the threat the country faces. That sounded like a clear jibe at Corbyn. McFadden goes on to ask why the government thinks Russia launched this attack. May thanks McFadden for his comment. It is not for her to comment on Russian motives, she says. But she says she suspects that they wanted to send a message to other Russians living abroad. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, clearly condemned Russia in his response to May\u2019s statement. In her response, May picked up on this and used it as a springboard to make a more pointed attack on Corbyn. She said she welcomed what Blackford said, and wished that every party leader in the Commons was able to clearly condemn Russia in the same way. In his response to May, Corbyn did condemn Russia, but he condemned it for not cooperating with the investigation. And he condemned the attack. But he did not say that he accepted that the Russian state was behind the attack (although he did not say he thought it wasn\u2019t to blame either.) May criticises Corbyn for refusing to accept that the Russian state was to blame for the novichok poisoning. Boris Johnson, the former foreign secretary, says MPs will have noticed the \u201csomewhat weaselly\u201d language used by Jeremy Corbyn in relation to Russia. I think the whole House will have noted what I\u2019m afraid was the somewhat weaselly language of the leader of the opposition in failing to condemn what is now, I think, incontrovertible, in the eyes of all right-thinking people, involvement of the Russian state at the highest level in the Salisbury poisonings. May says if the two individuals leave Russia, the UK will do everything possible to ensure they are brought to justice. May is replying to Corbyn. She says the UK has issued an interpol red notice and a European arrest warrant for the two suspects. But Russia does not allow extradition, she says. She says the UK has repeatedly asked Russia to account for what happened. Yet Russia repeatedly responded \u201cwith obfuscation and lies\u201d. She says this decision would have been taken at a high level in the Russian state. They must rein in the activities of the GRU, she says. She says she hopes that those who were cautious about blaming Russia in March (she is referring to Corbyn) will now accept it was to blame. She says Corbyn asked for the OPCW to be able to attribute blame. But Russia vetoes this, she says. Jeremy Corbyn starts by thanking May for advance sight of the statement, and for security briefings. The use of a nerve agent in Salisbury is an outrage, he says. He says he visited the city. He says he commends the police for their superhuman efforts in the investigation. Given the two Russians have been charged, what is May doing to get Russia to cooperate in bringing them to trial. He says the OPCW findings in this case are a sharp reminder of how the international community must act against chemical weapons. He says the use of this nerve agent is a breach of international law. Russia must explain how it came to be used in the UK, he says. He urges May to use OPCW procedures to press for this. He asks what May has done to hold this to account. He asks if the government will take any more effective actions against Russia as a state, or against the GRU. Corbyn says there is no international mechanism for attributing chemical weapons attacks to particular perpetrators. What is May doing to change this? What lessons have been learned from this? Corbyn says he condemns the appalling attacks. He says he commends the police and security services for their work. He says he will support any reasonable efforts to bring those responsible to account. And he condemns Russia for not cooperating with the investigation. May says in March Russia tried to sow doubt about the UK\u2019s claims. Some were minded to believe them. But the government has been proved right, she says. May says today\u2019s announcement shows the specific nature of the threat from the Russian GRU. She says the actions of the GRU are \u201ca threat to all our allies and all our citizens\u201d. She says we must step up our collective efforts against it. She says the UK is sharing intelligence with allies about it. She says the UK will \u201cdeploy the full range of tools from across our national security apparatus\u201d to counter the GRU. The UK has no disagreement with the Russian people, she says. But there can be no place for the kind of \u201cbarbaric activity\u201d seen in Salisbury. May ends by paying tribute to the people of Salisbury, and how they responded, as well as to the police and those in the intelligence community. May says the UK\u2019s allies were right to retaliate against Russia after the Salisbury attack. May says, if the two Russian suspects ever leave Russia, the UK will try to have them arrested. May says the government was right to say in March the Russian state was responsible. Now she can go further, she says. She can tell MPs that, based on a body of intelligence, the two Russians are officers from the Russian military intelligence service, also known as the GRU. She says the operation would \u201calmost certainly\u201d have been approved not just within the GRU, but by senior figures in the Russian state. It was not a \u201crogue operation\u201d, she says. May says the two Russians facing charges over the poisoning of the Skripals are now also the prime suspects for the poisoning of Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley. She says if the two suspects were in a UK jurisdiction, there would be a clear case for charging them with murder. This is from my colleague Owen Gibson. Theresa May is now making her statement about Salisbury. This was a sickening attack, that left four people fighting for their lives and one person dead. She says in March she told MPs why the government thought the Russian state was culpable. She says 250 detectives have looked at more than 11,000 hours of CCTV, and taken statements. They have undertaken painstaking work to find out who was responsible. This has now produced enough evidence for the CPS to bring charges. She says the police have set out how the two Russians arrived in the country and travelled to Salisbury. (See 11.53pm.) May is now summarising what was in the Met statement released earlier. Labour\u2019s Geoffrey Robinson asks May if the government will continue to support his private member\u2019s bill bringing in presumed consent for organ donation. May says the government backs the bill and will continue to back it. Labour\u2019s Chris Ruane says Tory Brexiters said Wales would not lose out on funding if the UK left the EU. Since 2000 Wales has had \u00a35.3bn in structural funding. Will this continue? May says the government is working to ensure that future funds are in place to replace EU structural funds that work for the whole of the UK. Labour\u2019s Helen Hayes says it has been reported today that No 10 is blocking plans for guaranteed three-year tenancies for renters. May says the government does want more secure tenancies. The government has been consulting on its proposals. It is now considering the responses. Andrea Jenkyns, a Conservative, asks about a local Tory councillor who she says is being intimidated by Labour opponents. May says she is sorry the councillor is being subject to these appalling attacks. She says people should be able to represent constituents free of hatred and abuse. Alberto Costa, a Conservative, says his daughter is starting at a grammar school. What message does May have for her and people like her? May says this is a country where, how far you get on in life depends on how hard you work. Education is the key that will unlock the door to your future, she says. Steve Baker, the Tory former Brexit minister, asks May if she will order government to prepare for a no deal Brexit as a first priority. May commends Baker for the work he did on this when he was a minister. The Brexit department is working on this, she says. She says 6,400 civil servants are working on this, and another 1,850 are being taken on. UPDATE: I\u2019ve corrected this post. Originally it said May said 6,400 civil servants were working on plans for a no deal Brexit. In fact she said 6,400 civil servants were working on Brexit. She also said 1,850 more staff were being taken on, not 850 as it said in the original post. In response to Baker\u2019s question, which was specifically about no deal planning, she replied: I commend [Baker] for the work he did on this issue when he was a minister. I assure him that the Department for Exiting the European Union has indeed stepped up the work on preparations. We have 6,400 civil servants working on EU exit. There are an additional 1,850 recruits in the pipeline so that we can accelerate preparations as necessary. Mohammad Yasin, the Labour MP, asks May to reinstate bursaries for nurses. Their removal has had a terrible impact, he says. May says NHS spending in Yasin\u2019s Bedford constituency is going up. Bob Neill, a Conserative, asks if Gibraltar will be fully included in the Brexit withdrawal agreement. May says she can give that assurance. Tonia Antoniazzi, the Labour MP, says NHS trusts are not backing applications for the use of medicinal cannabis. She asks May to show leadership on this issue. May says she offers her sympathy to people with conditions where other treatments don\u2019t help. That is why the government has changed the rules to allow cannabis products to be used for medicinal purposes. This is from Sky\u2019s Faisal Islam. PMQs - Snap verdict: It\u2019s hard to recall now that there was a time when Jeremy Corbyn avoided the topic of Brexit at PMQs at all costs. Today he devoted all six questions to it, he made it look easy and he won quite comfortably. It is not hard to see why; you could probably use the number of Brexit questions Corbyn asks each month as a reliable index for the success of the Brexit talks, and Corbyn was good today because he neatly highlighted the very real concerns that Theresa May\u2019s strategy, and her decision to bet her administration on a plan rejected by much of her party and the EU, is driving the UK towards a no deal Brexit. His questions weren\u2019t flashy or profound, but they were effective. He used contrasting quotes to highlight cabinet divisions on this issue, he gently mocked Dominic Raab\u2019s claim that a no deal Brexit would have certain advantages (so does death, I suppose, or the bubonic plague) and, quoting people as diverse as the NFU and Mervyn King, he articulated the genuine concerns about what would happen if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. On another day May\u2019s counter-thrust on antisemitism might have resonated, but today it just felt irrelevant. And, with the chances of a no deal Brexit increasing, her attempt to weaponise the second referendum argument did not work either. Corbyn is still officially sceptical about a second referendum, but the questions he asked went some way to justify his decision not to indulge May by ruling one out. Corbyn says the NFU says a no deal Brexit would be armageddon, the TUC says it would be devastating for working people, and EU leaders have ruled it out. Does May think there will be a deal by October? May says she is working for a deal in October. She says what would be bad for the UK would be signing up to a deal in any circumstances. Corbyn says Mervyn King today condemned the government\u2019s incompetence. May says no deal is better than a bad deal. But no deal is a bad deal. Everyone is telling her that. Chequers is dead. When will May publish a plan that survives contact with her cabinet and reality - two different concepts, he says. May say she wants a deal that will work for the UK. She wants an economy that works for everyone. What is Corbyn doing - trying to change his party so that antisemites can call the creation of Israel racist. He should be ashamed of himself. Corbyn says Dominic Raab, the Brexit secretary, said yesterday there were \u201ccountervailing opportunities\u201d to a no deal Brexit. What are they? May says she wants a deal. She again challenges Corbyn to rule out a second referendum. Corbyn says a majority of people voted to leave. But they expected the negotiations to be handled competently. They are not being, he says. He says May could not name any of the no deal opportunites. She cannot keep dancing around all the issues, he says (to laughter - a joke about her African dance moves.) How many firms have said they will relocated if there is no Brexit deal? May says businesses have shown confidence in the UK. She lists various investment announcements. What we are doing is negotiating a Brexit deal that will deliver for this country, she says. She says Corbyn wanted a Brexit that would allow new trade deals; now he wants to be in the customs union. And she says his view on free movement is not clear. Jeremy Corbyn says there is no place for racism in our society, and that includes in the Conservative party. He says Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, says the odds on a no deal Brexit are 60/40. Is he right? May says the government is preparing for a no deal Brexit. It is publishing technical notices. There will be around 70. She says the government is working for a good deal, but preparing for every eventuality. Corbyn says Fox said he was unphased by the prospect of a no deal Brexit. But Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, said it would be a hugh geopolitical mistake, and Philip Hammond, the chancellor, said it would slash growth by 8%. Who is right? May says she agrees with the WTO boss who said a no deal Brexit would not be a walk in the park, but that it would not be the end of the world. She says she won\u2019t accept a second referendum. Corbyn should rule one out, she says. Maggie Throup, a Conservative, asks May for an assurance that she will always challenge antisemitism. May says there is no place for racial hatred in this country. The UK was the first country to accept the definition of antisemitism set out by the International Holocaust Memorial Alliance. She says Jeremy Corbyn, when he stands up, should apologise for saying British Jewish people do not understand English irony. Labour\u2019s Tulip Siddiq asks about Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, and asks if she will raise her case with the Iranian president when they meet in New York later this month. May says her thoughts are with Zaghari-Ratcliffe. She says one issue is the fact that Iran does not recognise dual nationality. She says she has regularly raised this with the Iranian president Theresa May starts by congratulating the English and Scottish women football teams for qualifying for the World Cup. This is from the Times\u2019 Patrick Kidd. PMQs is about to start. According to RT, the state-controlled Russian broadcaster, the Russian foreign ministry has said the two names released by the Met and the CPS do not mean anything to them. Here are some of the highlights from the statement from the Met\u2019s Neil Basu about the evidence against the two Russian suspects in the novichok poisoning case. Basu sets out in detail the movements of the two Russians while they were in the UK. They arrived at Gatwick from Moscow on Friday 2 March and stayed at the City Stay Hotel in Bow Road, East London on Friday night and Saturday night. On Saturday they conducted what the police describe as a \u201creconnaissance\u201d trip to Salisbury. He goes on: On Sunday, 4 March, they made the same journey from the hotel, again using the underground from Bow to Waterloo station at approximately 8.05am, before continuing their journey by train to Salisbury. CCTV shows them in the vicinity of Mr Skripal\u2019s house and we believe that they contaminated the front door with novichok. They left Salisbury and returned to Waterloo Station, arriving at approximately 4.45pm and boarded the London Underground at approximately 6.30pm to London Heathrow Airport. From Heathrow Airport, they returned to Moscow on Aeroflot flight SU2585, departing at 10.30pm on Sunday, 4 March. We have no evidence that they re-entered the UK after that date. Having taken advice from Public Health England, we are confident that there was no risk to members of the public who were on the same flight, trains or public transport used by the suspects. On 4 May 2018, tests were carried out in the hotel room where the suspects had stayed. A number of samples were tested at DSTL at Porton Down. Two swabs showed contamination of novichok at levels below that which would cause concern for public health. A decision was made to take further samples from the room as a precautionary measure, including in the same areas originally tested, and all results came back negative. We believe the first process of taking swabs removed the contamination, so low were the traces of novichok in the room. Following these tests, experts deemed the room was safe and that it posed no risk to the public. He says the police are releasing various images of the two Russians, travelling under the names. Alexander Petrov and Rusian Boshirov. He asks members of the public who saw them to get in touch. He urges anyone who stayed at the City Stay Hotel between 4 March and 4 May to get in touch, although he says their health does not seem to be at risk. The levels of novichok we found in the room at the time of police sampling in May were such that they were not enough to cause short or long-term health effects to anyone exposed to it, at that point or thereafter. We will continue to work closely with Public Health England as new information comes to light. He says the poisoning of Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley is linked to the attack on the Skripals and he explains why. Our rationale for linking the two investigations is primarily based on the following four facts: Firstly, our own analysis, and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in the Hague, has confirmed that the same type of novichok was used in both cases. Secondly, the nerve agent is one of the rarest chemical warfare agents in the world and its discovery, twice, in such close proximity is beyond a coincidence. Third, the manner in which the bottle and packaging has been adapted makes it a perfect cover for smuggling the weapon into the country, and a perfect delivery method for the attack against the Skripal\u2019s front door. Fourthly, the lack of crossover between the known movements of the suspects and Dawn and Charlie\u2019s known movements around Salisbury, and the fact that there is no evidence to suggest they have been targeted mean it is much more likely Dawn and Charlie found. He explains how Sturgess and Rowley came to be poisoned. Charlie told police he found a box he thought contained perfume in a charity bin on Wednesday, 27 June. Inside the box was a bottle and applicator. He tried to put the two parts together at his home address on Saturday, 30 June, and in doing so got some of the contents on himself. He said Dawn had applied some of the substance to her wrists before feeling unwell. After Charlie told police where he found the box, cordons were put in place and two bins behind shops in Catherine Street, Salisbury, were removed. Previously, during a search of Charlie\u2019s home address in Muggleton Road on 10 July a small box labelled as Nina Ricci Premier Jour was recovered from a rubbish bag in the kitchen. On 11 July a small glass bottle with a modified nozzle was found on a kitchen worktop. Tests undertaken at DSTL established the bottle contained a significant amount of novichok. We have carried out numerous inquiries in relation to the bottle and are now able to release an image of it with the nozzle attached. We are also releasing an image of the box that the bottle and nozzle were in. We have spoken to Nina Ricci and undertaken further inquiries. Nina Ricci and our inquiries have confirmed that it is not a genuine Nina Ricci perfume bottle, box or nozzle. It is in fact a counterfeit box, bottle and nozzle that have been especially adapted. I\u2019d like to reassure anyone who has bought Nina Ricci perfume from a legitimate source that they should not be concerned. It is safe. The Metropolitan police has now published the full text of a lengthy statement by Neil Basu, its national lead on counter terrorism, about the evidence against the two Russians accused of being responsible for the novichok attack in Salisbury in March. I will publish highlights shortly. Here is the statement from Sue Hemming, CPS director of legal services, about the decision to identify two Russian suspects in the novichok case. She said: Prosecutors from CPS counter terrorism division have considered the evidence and have concluded there is sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction and it is clearly in the public interest to charge Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, who are Russian nationals. Those offences include conspiracy to murder Sergei Skripal; the attempted murder of Sergei Skripal, Yulia Skripal and Nick Bailey; the use and possession of novichok contrary to the Chemical Weapons Act; and causing grievous bodily harm with intent to Yulia Skripal and Nick Bailey. Hemming went on: A realistic prospect of conviction means the CPS is satisfied on an objective assessment that the evidence can be used in court and that an objective, impartial and reasonable jury hearing the case, properly directed and acting in accordance with the law, is more likely than not to convict these two individuals of the charges. It is of course for a jury to decide whether the evidence is enough for them to be sure of the suspects guilt. We will not be applying to Russia for the extradition of these men as the Russian constitution does not permit extradition of its own nationals. Russia has made this clear following requests for extradition in other cases. Should this position change then an extradition request would be made. We have, however, obtained a European Arrest Warrant which means that if either man travels to a country where an EAW is valid, they will be arrested and face extradition on these charges for which there is no statute of limitations. Here is my colleague Vikram Dodd\u2019s story about the Scotland Yard/CPS Salisbury announcement. And here is how it starts. Two suspected Russian nationals have been named over the novichok poisoning of Sergei and Julia Skripal in March in Salisbury, Wiltshire. British police and prosecutors made the announcement on Wednesday. They were travelling on authentic Russian passports under the names of Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov. Police said there was enough evidence to charge them. The news comes after two separate poisonings involving novichok that left three people seriously ill and killed one woman. The use of the Russian military grade poison on British soil strained already tense relations between London and Moscow. The first use of novichok came in March and targeted the former Russian spy Sergei Skripaland his daughter, Yulia, in their Salisbury home. More snaps from the Press Association. The CPS said it will not be applying to Russia for the extradition of the two men, but a European Arrest Warrant has been obtained. Assistant Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Neil Basu said it is likely the suspects were travelling under aliases and Petrov and Boshirov are not their real names. They are believed to be aged around 40. This from the BBC\u2019s Daniel Sandford. The Press Association has just snapped this. There is sufficient evidence to charge two Russian nationals named as Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov with offences including conspiracy to murder over the Salisbury nerve agent attack, Scotland Yard and the Crown Prosecution Service have announced. Theresa May\u2019s Commons statement this afternoon will be about the Salisbury novichok attack, the BBC reports. What UK Thinks, the website publishing polling research on what people think of Brexit, has published a paper today by the leading psephologist Sir John Curtice looking at how attitudes to Brexit have changed since the EU referendum. The full paper is here (pdf) and Curtice has written a blog summarising its arguments here. He says that in some respects views have changed more than people think. Our survey shows that, in some respects at least, voters have changed their minds quite considerably about various aspects of the Brexit process over the course of the last two years. Voters seem, for example, to have become somewhat less concerned about controlling EU migration, less convinced that British companies will be able to trade freely in the EU after Brexit, and much less inclined to believe that the UK will secure a good deal from the negotiations. Moreover, while they might, perhaps, have reached these conclusions for different reasons, these patterns are just as much in evidence among leave voters as their remain-supporting counterparts. Curtice says, on the overall question of whether Britain should stay or leave, there has been little change. But he says people who now think Brexit won\u2019t have the economic advantages or disadvantages claimed in 2016 are shifting their views. Over 90% of those voters who voted Remain in June 2016 and who think that Britain\u2019s economy will get worse as a result of Brexit say that they would vote the same way again in a second referendum. Equally, over 90% of those who backed Leave two years ago and who think the economy will be better off in the wake of Brexit state that they would vote Leave again. In short, hardly anyone who endorses \u2018their\u2019 side\u2019s economic argument has changed their mind. However, these figures fall off quite markedly among those who take a different view of the economics of Brexit. Only around three-quarters of those Remain voters who think that leaving the EU will not make much difference to the economy say they would vote Remain again, while the equivalent figure among Leave voters is much the same. Meanwhile, less than half of those Remain voters who are now of the view that Britain\u2019s economy will be better off as a result of Brexit would vote the same way, while the same is true of Leave supporters who believe the economy will be worse off. This could have consequences later, Curtice argues. In the midst of the doubtless sometimes fierce arguments in the coming weeks about what should and should not form part of the Brexit agreement and how well or badly the government (and the EU) are handling the negotiations, we should bear in mind that it is what voters make of the economics of whatever deal is reached that is most likely to determine whether, at the conclusion of the negotiations, a majority of them still want to leave the EU or whether the balance of opinion has swung in the opposite direction. The chief executive of Britain\u2019s third biggest food company has thrown its weight behind Theresa May\u2019s Chequers proposal saying it is a \u201cpretty satisfactory\u201d way to solve the Brexit challenges. Patrick Coveney, who is also brother of Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister Simon Coveney, said it would be tough to get through because it was under attack from all sides, but said there were no other plans on the table. He said: I think Britain is at a pretty fragile place on the topic right now, and probably the sort of best working compromise which the Chequers proposal is probably a pretty satisfactory way through this in some form or another if it can be delivered. Coveney, CEO of Greencore, told British Irish Chambers of Commerce seminar on agrifood in Dublin on Wednesday that the \u201cworrying thing\u201d for business was that there was no alternative on the table and the country was staring at an unimaginable political \u201cabyss\u201d if Chequers was chucked. \u201cIt is very difficult to see the prime minister survive a roll back from Chequers,\u201d said Coveney whose firm supplies two thirds of Britain\u2019s sandwiches every day. He said the company was not so much concerned about tariffs but delays at Dover and Calais. If food rotted in the containers in 50m queues, it would not matter if tomatoes or lettuces from Spain or Holland attracted a 15% or 20% tariff. Coveney also said British supermarkets were \u201cpushing hard\u201d on the government to see the dark consequences of food shortages after Brexit. \u201cThe one thing for sure would create dramatic and immediate political instability in March would be 1/2/3/4 weeks or months of real food shortages in the UK which is not inconceivable with the direction of travel with no deal,\u201d he said. Here is the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg on the May statement coming later. The decision by Labour\u2019s national executive committee yesterday to adopt all the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance\u2019s examples of antisemitism, as well as the precise definition (which it already accepted), has not quelled the row about the party\u2019s stance on this issue. On the Today programme this morning Dame Margaret Hodge, one of the MPs most critical of Jeremy Corbyn over this, said he had to rebuild trust with the Jewish community. She told the programme: [Corbyn] now has to own the problem, he has to act and he has to start rebuilding trust. He is the leader of the Labour party, the onus is really on him ... I would love it if he proved me wrong, but we have to see both in his actions and in the way he consults and engages with the Jewish community over the coming period whether or not we are on the right road back to rebuilding trust. She also said that the decision to accept all the IHRA examples was \u201csullied\u201d by the fact that Corbyn tried to get the party to agree to a lengthy addendum to the IHRA text. I campaigned for the full IHRA definition to be adopted. I\u2019m delighted by that. I\u2019m saddened it was sullied by this argument over an additional statement. I\u2019m saddened that the leader of the Labour party chose to try to amend it. But Shami Chakrabarti, the shadow attorney general, told the programme that the short proviso that was agreed alongside the IHRA wording did not amount to \u201csullying\u201d. She said: There was no sullying. The words were not a caveat, were not a dilution; the words are true, which is that accepting these examples, in my view, in no way negates reasonable free speech around these difficult issues around Israel and Palestine. Good morning. It\u2019s will be a particularly busy day at Westminster today. We have got the first PMQs of the autumn, a potentially interesting committee hearing with the Brexit secretary Dominic Raab (following important Brexit interventions from Mervyn King and Andy Burnham), and this morning we have learned Theresa May will be making a surprise statement to MPs. My colleague Dan Sabbagh has filed this. Theresa May is expected to make a statement to the Commons after Prime Minister\u2019s Questions today, according to Whitehall and Westminster sources. Downing Street would not confirm the subject matter, although the secrecy at this stage is likely to suggest a security related matter. The statement could be an update relating to the Novichok poisoning incidents in Salsibury and Amesbury, although again this could not be confirmed. Here is the agenda for the day. 9am: Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, speaks at the launch of the IPPR thinktank\u2019s report on economic justice. 9.30am: George Eustice, the agriculture minister, gives evidence to the Commons agriculture committee on fishing. 10am: Andy Burnham, the Labour mayor of Greater Manchester, gives a speech on Brexit. As Matthew Weaver reports, Burnham is now giving qualified backing to a second referendum on Brexit while warning it risks sparking unrest on the streets of the city. 10am: The Association of Jewish Women\u2019s Organisations and other organisations give evidence to the Commons women and equalities commission on antisemitism. 12pm: Theresa May faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs. After 12.30pm: May is expected to make a statement to MPs on a subject not disclosed. 2.30pm: Dominic Raab, the Brexit secretary, and Olly Robbins, May\u2019s chief Brexit adviser, give evidence to the Commons Europeaan scrutiny committee. There were reports saying the parliamentary Labour party (PLP) would meet tonight to discuss antisemitism, but Labour say the next PLP meeting will not take place until Monday. As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I will post a summary at the end of the day. I plan to wrap up at around 5.30pm. You can read all today\u2019s Guardian politics stories here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but normally I find it impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer direct questions, although sometimes I miss them or don\u2019t have time. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

But this week Canadians have been forced to confront the possibility of a breakdown in trade relations with their closest ally and biggest trading partner, after the US president announced a preliminary deal with Mexico. The news left Canadians reeling and sent the country\u2019s foreign minister rushing to Washington DC in the hope of salvaging the decades-old North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) \u2013 a three-way deal between the US, Canada and Mexico. The stakes for Canada are sky-high; the country sends three quarters of its exports south of the border while roughly 2.5m Canadian jobs depend on US trade. If Canada fails to keep its place in the free trade bloc, the US might respond with punitive tariffs on Canadian-made cars, mused Trump this week, breathing life into a scenario dubbed \u201cCarmageddon\u201d by Canada\u2019s auto industry for the catastrophic job losses it could provoke. \u201cIn essence, [prime minister Justin] Trudeau is being forced to negotiate with a gun to his head,\u201d Meredith Lilly, a trade adviser to the former prime minister Stephen Harper, wrote in an article for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. \u201cThere are a range of matters still to be resolved, but it seems as though there are no poison pills left \u2013 only bitter ones for Canada to swallow.\u201d Trump is pushing for a draft of Nafta to be completed by Friday in order to accommodate a 90-day waiting period under US trade law and push the deal through before an upcoming change in Mexico\u2019s government. The US president\u2019s actions have left trade experts across North America divided, sparking debates as to whether the deadline set out by the White House is firm and whether the president has the authority to transform the trilateral agreement into a bilateral one. Others have pointed to the upcoming midterm elections in the US, contextualising Trump\u2019s announcement as political theatre aimed at reassuring his base and upping the pressure on Canada to acquiesce to US demands. The result has been a tremendous amount of bewilderment over what, exactly, the Canadians can do this week as they sit down to negotiate the agreement. \u201cIf the mood prevailing in the Canadian camp in Washington could be summed up in a sentence, it would be: if you\u2019re not confused, you\u2019re misinformed,\u201d noted the National Post columnist John Ivison.

Canada\u2019s foreign minister has remained upbeat, describing Mexico\u2019s concessions on auto rules of origin and labour rights as a breakthrough even as her team readied for talks to push through the night.

          "bodyText": "The pound has managed to stay above the $1.30 mark, after comments from Michel Barnier boosted hopes that a Brexit deal will be struck. The EU\u2019s chief negotiator said \u201cwe are prepared to offer Britain a partnership such as there never has been with any other third country\u201d. Meanwhile a report that France\u2019s President Emmanuel Macron will push for a deal with Britain also raised the possibility of a softer approach from the EU. The pound is at $1.3017 and is up 0.2% against the euro at \u20ac1.1146. Pressure is mounting on Canada and the US as a Friday deadline looms for a new NAFTA agreement. Negotiators struck an upbeat tone but remain locked in talks. In the UK, payday lender Wonga stopped taking new loan applications as its troubles deepen, and the competition watchdog gave the provisional go-ahead to a merger between energy firms SSE and Npower. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The number of Americans filing new unemployment claims rose last week, to 213,000 from 210,000 the week before. It was slightly below the 214,000 claims predicted by economists, but ended a three-week run of falls. However the broader picture was more positive, with the four-week moving average of initial claims falling 1,500 last week to 212,250 - the lowest level since December 1969. US consumer spending rose 0.4% in July, the same rate as June and in line with economists\u2019 forecasts. The figures from the Commerce Department showed that American households spent more at restaurants and on hotels and other accommodation last month. Consumer spending accounts for more than two thirds of the US economy, and helped to boost growth in the second quarter, when GDP rose at an annualised rate of 4.2%, nearly double the 2.2% rate in the previous quarter. Not everyone with an eye on markets is in a gloomy mood today: Daniel Boffey, the Guardian\u2019s Brussels bureau chief, gives his take on Michel\u2019s Barnier\u2019s latest Brexit comments: Greece has suffered the deepest depression in the modern era, according to an analysis by economists at Llewellyn Consulting. Greece might have emerged from its final bail-out with official creditors, they say, but 10 years on from the global financial crisis, the country has yet to enjoy a meaningful recovery. They point out that among other things, GDP is still about 25% below its pre-crisis peak; nearly a fifth of the workforce are unemployed, and the proportion of people in poverty has doubled. All this represents the deepest contraction in a major economy in the modern era. The only comparable downturn is the 1930s Great Depression in the US. However, then US real GDP was back to its pre-crisis peak after seven years. Here is a Q&amp;A on what Wonga\u2019s collapse would mean for its customers: Jonathan Reynolds, Labour MP and shadow economic secretary to the Treasury, has responded to the news that payday lender Wonga has stopped taking new loan applications: We need urgent action from the government to change this broken model and review the way lending is regulated. I cannot mourn the demise of Wonga. Its business model was exploitative and immoral. Wonga had become a testament to so much that is wrong with our economy - too many people stuck in insecure employment reliant on short term debt just to keep their heads above water. That is why the next Labour government will lift living standards and tackle the persistent debt spiral that many working families have become trapped in by capping exploitative lending, increasing real wages, and ending austerity. With equity markets across Europe still falling and US futures down, Connor Campbell at Spread Ex considers why investors are in a glum mood: The sentiment in Europe remained sour, with all the major indices catching a serious case of the blues. It is hard to pinpoint the exact reason for the downturn. A lack of distraction arguably puts Brexit and the US-China trade war at the forefront of investors\u2019 minds, though on both fronts there has been slight progress, with Barnier\u2019s bullish comments in relation to the former, and the US-Mexico trade deal (admittedly a tenuous positive) in regards to the latter. Regardless of the reason, the Dow Jones is set to join the end of August malaise after the bell rings on Wall Street, with the futures pointing to a 90 points drop when the US session gets underway. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at currency firm Oanda, says the more positive tone on Brexit struck by the EU could be the first step towards taking a no deal scenario off the table, which would be supportive of the pound. He explains: The pound is paring gains but continues to trade around four week highs against the dollar, with the currency having been buoyed on Wednesday by comments from Michel Barnier who claimed to be open to the idea of a bespoke Brexit deal for the UK, something the EU had appeared averse to previously. The apparent softening in the language, combined with French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s desire to maintain close ties, come at a time when a no deal Brexit was looking increasingly likely. The latest comments suggest there is a strong desire within the EU to find a solution and avoid a no deal Brexit which is understandably good for the UK and the pound. Sterling had come under pressure in recent months as the prospect of no deal became more of a possibility but this is hopefully the first step towards it not becoming a reality. We\u2019ve seen a small relief rally but we\u2019ll need to see many more positive steps before traders get carried away. Economic sentiment in the eurozone fell for an eighth consecutive month in August, as industrial and services firms were less optimistic. The monthly survey by the European Commission showed the economic sentiment indicator for the 19 euro countries dipped to 11.6 points in August from 112.1 in July, extending the run of falls. Jessica Hinds, European economist at Capital Economics, says that despite another fall, the indicator points to fairly strong growth. Although the EC\u2019s measure of eurozone economic sentiment fell again in August, it remains at a high level and consistent with growth slowing only slightly from a very strong pace. On the face of it, it still points to a pick-up in annual GDP from 2.2% in the second quarter to around 3%. Note, though, that it has overstated growth since last summer and other surveys have been slightly less positive. So, overall, the surveys are consistent with only a modest slowdown. Economists at RBC have played down the importance of a more optimistic approach to Brexit from Michel Barnier and Emmanuel Macron, stressing that major hurdles remain: On Brexit, after yesterday\u2019s comments from Barnier (relationship such as there has never been with any other third country) the market appears more hopeful. French president Macron has apparently suggested a \u2018new architecture\u2019 of \u2018concentric circles\u2019 with the UK in the first ring around the euro area. We, however, stress that even if there is a deal struck between the EU and the UK, an even tougher hurdle will be to get any deal through the UK House of Commons - which at present seems to have moved down the ladder of concerns. \u200e This is particularly true as any deal is unlikely to see the EU make any material concessions, as Barnier also highlighted yesterday when he stressed the importance of the integrity of the single market. The German foreign minister also said in a tweet that there will be \u2018no special rules for post-Brexit UK\u2019. British consumers borrowed at the weakest rate in more than two-and-a-half years in July, according to figures from the Bank of England. Consumer credit growth slowed to an annual rate of 8.5% in July from 8.8% in June. It was the slowest since November 2015. Meanwhile mortgage approvals dipped to 64,768 from 65,374, slightly below economists\u2019 forecasts of 65,000. Jeremy Leaf, north London estate agent and a former residential chairman of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, says the mortgage figures are surprisingly weak: These figures are a little disappointing in that they reflect a period when we would have expected a pick-up in the market over the spring buying season. Buyers and sellers are still engaged in a stand-off, whereas lack of energised demand has meant there is often very little urgency to complete deals, even when terms have been agreed. There are regional variations, however. In London, owners who have accumulated property wealth from previous booms seem more reluctant to recognise softening prices whereas outside the capital, where loans to value are generally higher, we have noticed more enthusiasm to move. Overall, viewings are starting to rise as buyers return from holiday so we do expect to see some increase in activity over the next few months. The competition watchdog has given the provisional go-ahead to the merger of Npower and the retail arm of SSE. The Competition and Markets Authority found that the two firms did not compete closely for customers on the default standard variable tariffs that most people are on. Few people switched between the pair, it added. A merger between the two would reduce Britain\u2019s \u201cbig six\u201d energy providers to five. The newly combined company would have 11 million customers, making it the second biggest UK energy provider after British Gas, which has 12.6 million customers. The merger is expected to complete in late 2018 or early 2019. European investors are in a subdued mood, with all major indices in the red this morning after falls in Asian markets. FTSE 100: -0.7% at 7,508 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.4% at 12,513 France\u2019s CAC: -0.2% at 5,493 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.3% at 20,690 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -0.03% at 9,567 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.3% at 385 Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets: Markets in Asia have continued to be dominated by concerns over simmering China trade tensions, and the prospect of further tariffs next month, while markets in Europe have also slipped back. The unresolved nature of the EU US trade talks is clearly acting as a drag on European markets in the same way that markets in Asia have continued to lag behind. Wonga has stopped taking new loan applications in a sign of deepening trouble at the payday lender on the brink of collapse. A statement on Wonga\u2019s website reads: While it continues to assess its options Wonga has decided to stop taking loan applications. If you are an existing customer you can continue to use our services to manage your loan. It follows reports over the weekend that Wonga has lined up accountancy firm Grant Thornton to handle a potential administration of the company. On Wednesday, the pay day lender held emergency talks with the Financial Conduct Authority over the impact of its collapse on existing customers. Negotiators for Canada and the US are locked in \u201cintense\u201d talks as they try to strike a new trade deal by the Friday deadline set by President Trump. Canada\u2019s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, said on Wednesday evening that talks were at \u201ca very intense moment\u201d but added there was \u201ca lot of good will\u201d between negotiators on both sides of the table. The pressure is on to modernise the 24-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement after the US and Mexico reached a bilateral deal on Monday. Trump set a Friday deadline for all three countries to reach a deal, but Canada said late on Wednesday that a number of tricky issues were yet to be resolved. Trump has warned he could try to go ahead with a deal with Mexico alone and impose tariffs on Canadian-made cars if Ottawa does not agree a deal, although US lawmakers have said that ratifying a bilateral deal would not be easy. The US President told reporters at the White House: They (Canada) want to be part of the deal, and we gave until Friday and I think we\u2019re probably on track. We\u2019ll see what happens, but in any event, things are working out very well. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was giving nothing away: We recognise that there is a possibility of getting there by Friday, but it is only a possibility, because it will hinge on whether or not there is ultimately a good deal for Canada. No NAFTA deal is better than a bad NAFTA deal.\u201d France\u2019s President, Emmanuel Macron, is preparing to push other EU leaders to agree a Brexit deal with Britain, according to a report in the Times. Macron is hoping to persuade fellow leaders that a close relationship with Britain after Brexit will promote a united Europe. He will use a summit in Austria next month to outline a new structure for European alliances, the Time said, quoting unnamed diplomatic sources. The idea is based on \u201cconcentric circles\u201d with the EU and the euro at the core and Britain in a second ring. If this is the case, it will be a major boost to Theresa May, who has been hoping to strengthen her hand in negotiations by persuading individual leaders that a decent Brexit deal for Britain will be good for the EU. Will Barnier\u2019s Brexit boost to the pound last? Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, says there will be more volatility in the weeks ahead: Many investors would be wondering whether Barnier\u2019s statement could be a turning point for the pound. Although many issues related to trade and the Irish border are far from being resolved, it currently seems that negotiations may begin moving in the right direction. If positive news flows continue when Brexit secretary Dominic Raab heads back to Brussels on Friday to resume talks, GBPUSD may quickly return to July highs that were above 1.33. However, expect volatility to surge in the coming weeks as we get closer to the Brexit deadline. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Just as fears were mounting that Britain is on course to crash out of Europe without a deal, Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, took markets by surprise with a more optimistic view. Specifically, Barnier said: We are prepared to offer Britain a partnership such as there never has been with any other third country. The comment on Wednesday has pushed the pound back above the $1.30 mark (currently at $1.3033), and up against the euro at \u20ac1.1133. As Viraj Patel, Foreign Exchange Strategist at ING explains, the optimistic intervention was unexpected: GBP markets were caught off guard as the EU\u2019s Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said they were \u201cready to propose a partnership the likes of which has not existed before with any third country\u201d. This is something that most hadn\u2019t thought was possible and may trigger a partial reassessment of no deal Brexit risks that lends support to a politically-infested pound. While we\u2019re not jumping to any conclusions about the actual final Brexit deal (this remains highly complex), constructive comments by Barnier (and Brexit secretary Raab) suggesting that negotiations remain on track \u2013 and a deal can be achieved \u2013 may be enough to ruffle the feathers of speculative GBP markets that have latched onto a bearish no deal Brexit story.

They want to negotiate very badly.\u201d</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cOne way or the other, we have a deal with Canada. It\u2019ll either be a tariff on cars or it will be a negotiated deal. Frankly, a tariff on cars is a much easier way to go but perhaps the other would be much better for Canada.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump also said it might be possible to make a deal involving all three countries, like the 24-year-old Nafta pact, but that separate bilateral agreements are also a possibility.</p> \n<p>However, any trade deal would have to first be approved by Congress, and time is running out. Mexico\u2019s president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, will soon leave office and there is no guarantee his successor, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, will agree to the same terms.</p> \n<p>Nafta reduced most trade barriers between the US, Mexico and Canada. But Trump and other critics say it encouraged US manufacturers to move south of the border to exploit low-wage Mexican labour.</p> \n<p>With typical showmanship, the president invited reporters into the Oval Office, where he called Pe\u00f1a by speakerphone, but aides had to offer the president their technical help. \u201cHello?!\u201d Trump said into the machine at one point.</p> \n<p>NBC News journalist <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JoshNBCNews\">Josh Lederman</a> tweeted: \u201cThis is very likely a first in history: A White House pool spray where the president of the US puts a foreign leader on speakerphone.\u201d</p> \n<p>The announcement came after months of negotiations between the US and its southern neighbour.</p> \n<p>Trump said it would be called the United States-Mexico Trade Agreement. \u201cWe\u2019ll get rid of the name Nafta,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has a bad connotation because the United States was hurt very badly by Nafta for many years and it\u2019s now a really good deal for both countries.\u201d</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cI think it is one of the largest trade deals ever made \u2013 maybe the largest trade deal ever made.\u201d</p> \n<p>The agreement with Mexico requires 75% of a car\u2019s value to be manufactured in North America, up from Nafta\u2019s current level of 62.5%, Reuters reported. It would also require 40% to 45% of the car to be made by workers earning at least $16 per hour.</p> \n<p>Trump has repeatedly called Nafta a job-killing \u201cdisaster\u201d for the US.</p> \n<p>In the conversation with Pe\u00f1a, Trump said of the new deal: \u201cThis is something that\u2019s very special for our manufacturers and for our farmers from both countries, for all of the people that work for jobs. It\u2019s also great trade and it makes it a much more fair bill and we are very, very excited about it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Speaking through an interpreter, Pe\u00f1a said he hoped Nafta partner Canada will eventually be incorporated into the deal. \u201cIt is our wish, Mr President, that now Canada will also be able to be incorporated in all this. I assume that they are going to carry out negotiations of the sensitive bilateral issues between Canada and the United States.\u201d</p> \n<p>But Trump said: \u201cWe haven\u2019t started with Canada yet. We wanted to do Mexico and see if that was possible to do.\u201d</p> \n<p>Later, Trump and Justin Trudeau discussed trade in a telephone call and \u201cagreed to continue productive conversations,\u201d White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said in a statement.</p> \n<p>Trump earlier said of Canada: \u201cIf they\u2019d like to negotiate fairly, we\u2019ll do that. They have tariffs of almost 300% on some of our dairy products so we can\u2019t have that, we\u2019re not going to start with that.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think with Canada, frankly, the easiest thing we can do is to tariff their cars coming in. It\u2019s a tremendous amount of a money and it\u2019s a simple negotiation. It could end in one day and we take in a lot of money the following day.</p> \n<p>\u201cBut I think we\u2019ll have a chance to probably have a separate deal.

Here\u2019s a summary of what\u2019s happened today:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Former Trump campaign chairman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/paul-manafort\">Paul Manafort</a> has been found guilty of bank fraud, tax fraud and failure to report a foreign bank account</strong>, which may mean he spends the rest of his life in prison.<br></li> <li>In a separate court action in New York, <strong>former Trump personal lawyer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/michael-cohen\">Michael Cohen</a> pleaded guilty to eight federal crimes</strong> on Tuesday and said Trump had directed him to make two hush-money payments to women in violation of campaign finance laws. That case was referred to New York prosecutors by Mueller.<br></li> <li><strong>Trump spoke at a rally in West Virginia on Tuesday night and did not refer to either Manafort or Cohen</strong>, but did hit out at the \u201cRussian witch hunt\u201d.<br></li> <li><strong>As Trump landed in West Virginia he told reporters: \u201cPaul Manafort\u2019s a good man\u201d</strong> and portrayed the Manafort prosecution, which grew out of an FBI investigation predating the 2016 campaign, as an unnatural outgrowth of the investigation being carried out by special counsel Robert Mueller.<br></li> <li><strong>\u201cThis has nothing to do with Russian collusion,\u201d Trump said.</strong> \u201cThese are witch hunts and it\u2019s a disgrace. This has nothing to do \u2013 it started out looking for Russians in our campaign and there were none.\u201d<br></li> <li>Trump ignored shouts from reporters requesting comment on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/michael-cohen\">Michael Cohen</a> case.<br></li> <li>Speaking to MSNBC on Tuesday night, <strong>Lanny Davis, Michael Cohen\u2019s laywer, said: \u201cMr Cohen has knowledge on certain subjects that should be of interest to the special counsel and is more than happy to tell the special counsel all that he knows.\u201d</strong> Davis said Cohen had intel about the \u201cpossibility of a conspiracy to collude and corrupt the American democracy system in the 2016 election\u201d and also knowledge about \u201cthe computer crime of hacking and whether or not Mr Trump knew ahead of time about that crime\u201d.</li> </ul> <p>For more, see our main story <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/22/worst-hour-for-trump-after-convictions-for-manafort-and-cohen\">here</a>.

They\u2019re still looking for collusion,\u201d he said.</li> <li>The rest of the speech was a rambling affair, taking on a variety of subjects from ESPN, Thanksgiving turkeys, Chinese tariffs, threats to impose hefty tariffs on cars imported from the European Union, his positive relationship with Kim Jong-un, the Paris Accord and social media censorship.</li> <li>Supporters at the rally were incredibly vocal, cheering Trump, booing when he mentioned an opponent or perceived enemy, and chanting \u201cLock her up!\u201d, \u201cUSA! USA!\u201d and \u201cBuilt that wall!\u201d It seems that among his base, support is undimmed despite today\u2019s news.</li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-08-22T01:03:13.944Z\">at 2.03am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5b7cad62e4b0fbb2e099361f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-22T00:28:03.194Z\">1.28am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It\u2019s quite hard to keep up with the twists and turns of this speech.

Then the gestating chicken became a turkey, and now Trump is onto his mother making the best Thanksgiving turkey, which needed eight hours to cook.

In addition, Mr Cohen sought reimbursement for that money by submitting invoices to the candidate\u2019s company, which were untrue and false.</p> <p>He indicated that the reimbursement was for services rendered for the year 2017 when, in fact, those invoices were a sham; he provided no legal services for the year 2017 and it was simply a means to obtain reimbursement of the unlawful campaign contributions.</p> <p>These are very serious charges and reflect a pattern of lies and dishonesty over a significant a period of time.

          "bodyText": "We\u2019re wrapping up the live coverage of what has been an extraordinary day in US politics. Here\u2019s a summary of what\u2019s happened today: Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort has been found guilty of bank fraud, tax fraud and failure to report a foreign bank account, which may mean he spends the rest of his life in prison. In a separate court action in New York, former Trump personal lawyer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to eight federal crimes on Tuesday and said Trump had directed him to make two hush-money payments to women in violation of campaign finance laws. That case was referred to New York prosecutors by Mueller. Trump spoke at a rally in West Virginia on Tuesday night and did not refer to either Manafort or Cohen, but did hit out at the \u201cRussian witch hunt\u201d. As Trump landed in West Virginia he told reporters: \u201cPaul Manafort\u2019s a good man\u201d and portrayed the Manafort prosecution, which grew out of an FBI investigation predating the 2016 campaign, as an unnatural outgrowth of the investigation being carried out by special counsel Robert Mueller. \u201cThis has nothing to do with Russian collusion,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThese are witch hunts and it\u2019s a disgrace. This has nothing to do \u2013 it started out looking for Russians in our campaign and there were none.\u201d Trump ignored shouts from reporters requesting comment on the Michael Cohen case. Speaking to MSNBC on Tuesday night, Lanny Davis, Michael Cohen\u2019s laywer, said: \u201cMr Cohen has knowledge on certain subjects that should be of interest to the special counsel and is more than happy to tell the special counsel all that he knows.\u201d Davis said Cohen had intel about the \u201cpossibility of a conspiracy to collude and corrupt the American democracy system in the 2016 election\u201d and also knowledge about \u201cthe computer crime of hacking and whether or not Mr Trump knew ahead of time about that crime\u201d. For more, see our main story here. Thanks for following along. Michael Cohen\u2019s lawyer, Lanny Davis, spoke to Rachel Maddow on MSNBC this evening. Davis says he took on Cohen as a client because \u201che wanted to tell the truth about Donald Trump\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s truth that Michael Cohen has committed to and it\u2019s truth that so threatens the president of the United States,\u201d he said. Davis added: \u201cMr Cohen has knowledge on certain subjects that should be of interest to the special counsel and is more than happy to tell the special counsel all that he knows. Not just about the obvious possibility of a conspiracy to collude and corrupt the American democracy system in the 2016 election, which the Trump tower meeting was all about, but also knowledge about the computer crime of hacking and whether or not Mr Trump knew ahead of time about that crime and even cheered it on, we know he cheered it on publicly, but whether he had private information.\u201d Davis is doing the rounds of interviews tonight and just finished speaking on CNN, where he said much of the same. In case you missed it, Cohen and Manafort are not the only prominent Trump backers who are in hot water today. Duncan Hunter, US Republican congressman, and his wife have been indicted on corruption charges. In 2016 Hunter was the second member of Congress to endorse Donald Trump for the White House, saying: \u201cWe don\u2019t need a policy wonk as president. We need a leader as president.\u201d Prosecutors said the panel in San Diego charged Hunter and his spouse with converting more than $250,000 in campaign money to pay for personal expenses, including dental work, fast food, golf outings, and vacations and trips for their family and nearly a dozen relatives. Earlier this month the first person from Congress to back Trump\u2019s White House run, Chris Collins of New York, was indicted for insider trading. He subsequently5ended his bid for re-election. The full story is here. On a lighter note, Newsmax has this story about how Paul Manafort\u2019s hometown tweaked a street name to make it clear the street had been named after Manafort\u2019s father (Paul Manafort Snr) and not his beleaguered son. Paul Manafort Snr served as mayor of New Britain, Conneticut from 1965-1971 and the town named a street after him \u2013 Paul Manafort Drive. As of last week, the street has been renamed Paul Manafort Snr Drive. What do today\u2019s events mean for Donald Trump? Tom McCarthy writes that today\u2019s guilty verdicts against Paul Manafort, Trump\u2019s former campaign chair, constitute a sign Robert Mueller has struck back against the president in a \u201csilent yet forceful way\u201d For Trump, the implications of the Manafort conviction and Cohen plea are ominous. In convicting Manafort, Mueller has won new impetus to prosecute figures even closer to Trump, should the evidence warrant. For Mueller\u2019s team, the guilty verdict represents a substantial victory, a significant hurdle cleared. The case was Mueller\u2019s first outing at trial, and a failure to convict might have called into question Mueller\u2019s broader enterprise. Tom\u2019s full analysis is here: The president has shared some photos on Twitter of the West Virginia rally, as well as a video of the speech, in case you fancied watching it in its entirety. Trump has wrapped up and left the stage at the rally. We\u2019ll bring you a full report of the speech shortly, but here are a few initial reactions to Trump\u2019s hour-long speech this evening. Trump made no mention of either Michael Cohen, his longtime lawyer who today pleaded guilty to eight charges including directly implicating Trump in paying \u201chush money\u201d to women with whom he allegedly had affairs or Paul Manafort, the president\u2019s former campaign chairman, was convicted on eight charges of bank and tax fraud. The closest Trump came was when he turned on the media pack at the rally, calling them (or what they were trying to do, it was unclear) \u201cFake news and the Russian witch hunt\u201d. \u201cWhere is the collusion? They\u2019re still looking for collusion,\u201d he said. The rest of the speech was a rambling affair, taking on a variety of subjects from ESPN, Thanksgiving turkeys, Chinese tariffs, threats to impose hefty tariffs on cars imported from the European Union, his positive relationship with Kim Jong-un, the Paris Accord and social media censorship. Supporters at the rally were incredibly vocal, cheering Trump, booing when he mentioned an opponent or perceived enemy, and chanting \u201cLock her up!\u201d, \u201cUSA! USA!\u201d and \u201cBuilt that wall!\u201d It seems that among his base, support is undimmed despite today\u2019s news. It\u2019s quite hard to keep up with the twists and turns of this speech. But it is worth going back to a baffling line from earlier on, in which Trump was explaining that some policies take time to come into effect. \u201cIt takes time for things to gestate, like when you cook a chicken,\u201d he said. Then the gestating chicken became a turkey, and now Trump is onto his mother making the best Thanksgiving turkey, which needed eight hours to cook. Baffling. Trump is now saying a great danger is \u201csocial media censorship\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s the new thing,\u201d he says. \u201cI would rather have fake news like CNN than have anyone stop being censored. We\u2019ve got to live with fake news, there are too many sources. Everyone of us is like a newspaper, Twitter, Facebook, but you can\u2019t have censorship, you can\u2019t pick one person and say we don\u2019t like what they\u2019re saying. \u201cWe\u2019ll live with fake news, I hate to say it, but that\u2019s the better alternative\u2026 we believe in the right of Americans to speak their mind.\u201d This follows on from tweets from Trump accusing social media sites of \u201ctotally discriminating against Republican/Conservative voices\u201d, which comes after social media platforms, including Facebook, restricted or banned Alex Jones, right-wing provocateur. Trump is talking about the Paris Accord \u2013 \u201cIs there a more beautiful name than the Paris Accord? The West Virginia Accord, maybe I would have signed it\u201d. Trump is saying he loves clean air and clean water, but that Trump thought the impact on the US was unfair. Plus, he adds: \u201cWe\u2019ve got the cleanest country in the planet right now.\u201d \u201cOur allies treat us worse than our enemies,\u201d Trump says. Trump has turned his anger on Canada, for tariffs on US dairy products. He says Justin Trudeau is a \u201cnice guy\u201d, but \u201cI don\u2019t want to have too much fun with you Justin. \u201cWe\u2019re like the big fat piggy bank that everyone wants to rob, and we\u2019re not letting them rob us anymore, is that OK?\u201d This speech, in classic Trump style, is taking in a number of topics. So far we\u2019ve had Trump say he will put a 25% tariff on every car that comes into the United States from the European Union. Now we\u2019re on the positive relationship Trump has with Kim Jong-un, with whom he says he has \u201cgood chemistry\u201d. \u201cWho knows what\u2019s going to happen?\u201d he says of the North Korean situation. \u201cWho knows?\u201d Now he is mentioning his previous hostile stance to North Korea \u2013 you will remember Trump called Kim \u201clittle rocket man\u201d, after the Elton John song. Trump is saying he does not want to insult Kim by repeating the insult, though he is doing anything but, telling the crowd: \u201cYou remember, you remember. Elton John.\u201d Michael Cohen\u2019s lawyer Lanny Davis has tweeted that this is a \u201cnew beginning\u201d for Cohen, who is committed to telling the truth. There seems to be an implied threat here to the president, as Davis writes that Cohen\u2019s commitment to \u201cindependence\u201d and truth-telling was seen \u201cfrom his sworn statement in federal court today\u201d about Trump\u2019s instruction to pay money to two women to stop them from making disclosures that would be detrimental to Trump. Trump has turned his ire on the media again, pointing to them on the floor of the rally as the crowd boos. He is calling the journalists (or their mission, it\u2019s unclear): \u201cFake news and the Russian witch hunt\u201d. \u201cWhere is the collusion? Where is the collusion?\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re still looking for collusion.\u201d The responses of this crowd at the West Virginia rally suggest support for the president among his base is undimmed by the convictions today of Manafort or Cohen. So far we have had rousing chants of \u201cBuild that wall\u201d, \u201cLock her up\u201d, and \u201cUSA, USA\u201d, as well as repeated boos whenever Trump mentions anyone he doesn\u2019t like, and screams whenever Trump mentions one of his perceived achievements. The US department of justice has released a statement about the Michael Cohen conviction. \u201cMichael Cohen is a lawyer who, rather than setting an example of respect for the law, instead chose to break the law, repeatedly over many years and in a variety of ways. His day of reckoning serves as a reminder that we are a nation of laws, with one set of rules that applies equally to everyone,\u201d said Robert Khyzami, attorney for the United States. FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge William F. Sweeney Jr. said: \u201c[A]s we all know, the truth can only remain hidden for so long before the FBI brings it to light. We are all expected to follow the rule of law, and the public expects us - the FBI - to enforce the law equally. Today, Mr. Cohen has been reminded of this important lesson, as he acknowledged with his guilty plea.\u201d Trump is back on one of this favourite subjects: the wall along the US-Mexico border. \u201cIt\u2019s coming along nicely,\u201d he tells a crowd that responds by chanting \u201cBuild that wall\u201d. Wall Street Journal reporter Rebecca Ballhaus is pointing out the irony of a crowd of Trump supporters chanting \u201cLock her up\u201d in relation to Hillary Clinton after the convictions of Michael Cohen and Paul Manfort today. We haven\u2019t had much of substance yet from Trump, who is speaking at the rally in West Virginia. He is currently boasting about his record of endorsements, citing candidates whose standing in the polls has improved dramatically after he has endorsed them. \u201cThen you watch the news, \u2018will this endorsement mean anything?\u2019 It\u2019ll mean a lot.\u201d Hi, this is Kate Lyons taking over from Kevin Rawlinson, just as Donald Trump is taking the stage at a rally in West Virginia. We\u2019ll have updates of what he says and whether he addresses today\u2019s dramatic Manafort/Cohen news. Paul Ryan\u2019s statement was spartan. The statement from the leader of the Democrats in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, is \u2013 perhaps unsurprisingly \u2013 more comprehensive: Today\u2019s guilty verdicts against President Trump\u2019s campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and the guilty plea of Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, are further evidence of the rampant corruption and criminality at the heart of Trump\u2019s inner circle. Cohen\u2019s admission of paying hundreds of thousands of dollars in hush money \u2018at the direction of the candidate\u2019 to influence the 2016 election shows the president\u2019s claims of ignorance to be far from accurate, and places him in even greater legal jeopardy. These convictions are further proof that the special counsel\u2019s team and prosecutors in New York are conducting thorough and professional investigations, which must be permitted to continue free from interference. Congressional Republicans\u2019 determination to cover up for the president and his criminal cronies betrays their oath of office and undermines their duty to the American people. House Republicans must abandon their complicity with president Trump and affirm that no one is above the law. The Trump administration and congressional Republicans\u2019 unprecedented culture of corruption, cronyism and incompetence is characteristic of the dysfunctional political system in Washington. Cohen will \u201cpay a very, very serious price\u201d, the prosecutor and deputy US attorney, Robert Khuzami, has said. Here\u2019s a pretty comprehensive run-down of his comments to reporters outside the federal court in Manhattan: [Cohen] failed to report income from his taxi medallion business, brokerage commissions, and over $200,000 from consulting fees. That\u2019s over $4.3m over a five year period, which translates into a loss to the US Treasury of approximately $1.3m. In count six, Cohen pleaded guilty to making false statements to a financial institution in connection to an application for a home equity line of credit. He failed to disclose $14m in debt that he had and, as a result of that concealment, attained that $500,000 line of credit. He pleaded guilty to two campaign finance charges: An unlawful corporate contribution; and making an excessive personal contribution, both for the purpose of influencing the 2016 election. He worked to pay money to silence two women who had information that he knew would be detrimental to the 2016 campaign and to the candidate and the campaign. In addition, Mr Cohen sought reimbursement for that money by submitting invoices to the candidate\u2019s company, which were untrue and false. He indicated that the reimbursement was for services rendered for the year 2017 when, in fact, those invoices were a sham; he provided no legal services for the year 2017 and it was simply a means to obtain reimbursement of the unlawful campaign contributions. These are very serious charges and reflect a pattern of lies and dishonesty over a significant a period of time. They are particularly significant when done by a lawyer; a lawyer who, through training and tradition, understands what it means to be a lawyer who upholds honest and fair dealing and adherence to the law. Mr Cohen disregarded that training and tradition and decided he is above the law and for that he is going to pay a very, very serious price. There has been a somewhat muted response from the US House speaker, Trump\u2019s Republican colleague Paul Ryan: According to the Associated Press, Stormy Daniels\u2019 lawyer, Michael Avenatti, says Michael Cohen\u2019s guilty plea should open the door to questioning Donald Trump about \u201cwhat he knew, when he knew it, and what he did about it\u201d. Cohen has admitted Trump directed him to make payments that violated campaign finance laws in an effort to keep quiet two women who alleged sexual affairs with the billionaire. Both Daniels and Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model, have made such allegations, though they were not explicitly named in court. Daniels said she and Avenatti, felt vindicated and look forward to apologies \u201cfrom the people who claimed we were wrong\u201d. Avenatti is flirting with running for president in 2020 as a Democrat. He said the likelihood of that happening will dwindle if Trump resigns or decides not to run for re-election. The US Department of Justice has announced that the second member of Congress to endorse Donald Trump, Duncan Hunter, has been indicted on charges of using campaign funds for personal ends, along with his wife Margaret. Trump\u2019s first congressional backer, Chris Collins, was indicted on insider trading charges about two weeks ago. Referring to the Hunters, the Department of Justice said: A 48-page indictment details scores of instances beginning in 2009 and continuing through 2016 in which the Hunters illegally used campaign money to pay for personal expenses that they could not otherwise afford. The purchases included family vacations to Italy, Hawaii, Phoenix, Arizona, and Boise, Idaho; school tuition; dental work; theatre tickets; and domestic and international travel for almost a dozen relatives. The Hunters also spent tens of thousands of dollars on smaller purchases, including fast food, movie tickets, golf outings, video games, coffee, groceries, home utilities, and expensive meals. They are scheduled to be arraigned on Thursday before US magistrate, Judge William Gallo. CNN\u2019s chief White House correspondent has a little on how the Trump family is reacting to the day\u2019s news at the president\u2019s campaign rally in West Virginia: Trump\u2019s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, says there is nothing in Cohen\u2019s admissions that represent an allegation of wrongdoing against the president. According to Reuters, Cohen\u2019s lawyer, Lanny Davis, said his client testified under oath that Trump directed him to commit a crime. Today, he (Cohen) stood up and testified under oath that Donald Trump directed him to commit a crime by making payments to two women for the principal purpose of influencing an election. If those payments were a crime for Michael Cohen, then why wouldn\u2019t they be a crime for Donald Trump? Davis said Cohen agreed to plead guilty \u201cso that his family can move on to the next chapter\u201d, Reuters reported. Cohen entered the courtroom on the 20th floor of the federal courthouse in lower Manhattan at 4:03pm and sat at a table with his attorneys. He turned and winked at someone in the crowd. He reviewed a series of documents and shook his head repeatedly as he looked them over. The judge, William Pawley, asked a series of questions to establish his competence. Asked his age, Cohen said: \u201cin four days I\u2019ll be 52.\u201d Asked if he had any drugs or alcohol in the last 24 hours, said yes: \u201clast night at dinner I had a glass of Glenlivet 12 on the rocks.\u201d Asked if he wanted to enter a plea of guilty, Cohen said: \u201cyes sir.\u201d It was explained to Cohen that, if sentenced consecutively, he faced a total of up to 65 years and that any estimate of how much time he would get from his attorney might be inaccurate. Cohen said: \u201cNo estimate was given to me your Honor.\u201d Cohen was asked to describe what he did with regard to each crime. On the first five counts, he said: \u201cI evaded paying substantial taxes\u201d on income he knew was omitted from his tax returns. On count six, he said that, in order to get approved for a home equity line of credit, he signed an application that omitted some of his liabilities. On count seven, the illegal corporate contribution, he said that, in the summer of 2016 \u2013 in coordination with and \u201cat the request of\u201d a candidate for federal office, in order \u201cto keep an individual with information that would be harmful to the candidate and the campaign from publicly disclosing this information,\u201d he arranged a payment through a media company of which he was the chief executive. \u201cShe received compensation of $150,000.\u201d This was done \u201cfor the principal purpose of influencing the election\u201d. On count eight \u2013 the illegal excessive campaign contribution \u2013 he said that, in coordination with the candidate, he \u201carranged to make a payment to a second individual with information that would be harmful to the candidate and the campaign\u201d. He said he used a company under his control and paid $130,000. These funds \u201cwere later repaid to me by the candidate\u201d. This was done \u201cfor the principal purpose of influencing the election\u201d. Asked if he knew these actions were illegal and wrong when he took them, Cohen said: \u201cYes your Honor.\u201d The assistant US attorney, Andrea Griswold, reviewed what would have been the government\u2019s case. On tax evasion, she said Cohen failed to report more than $4m (\u00a33.1m) in income. On illegal contributions: \u201cThese payments were made in order to ensure that each recipient did not publicise their stories\u201d about \u201calleged affairs with the candidate\u201d. She said the government had texts, phone and email records, and statements from the individuals involved as evidence. Asked how he now pleaded, Cohen said: \u201cGuilty, your Honor.\u201d He was released on a $500,000 personal recognisance bond to be signed by his wife and one other person. His travel was restricted to parts of the states of New York, New Jersey and Illinois, as well as the city of Washington DC. He agreed to surrender his passport. Sentencing was set for 12 December this year. After the hearing, Cohen left in a car with his attorneys as some bystanders shouted, \u201clock him up!\u201d Echoing the comments of his client somewhat, Trump\u2019s attorney Rudy Giuliani claims the government\u2019s charges against Michael Cohen contain \u201cno allegation of any wrongdoing against the president\u201d, Reuters reports. Cohen has told a judge he acted at the direction of \u201cthe candidate\u201d, acting for the \u201cpurpose of influencing the election\u201d. Cohen is Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer and the US president has previously said Cohen represented him in the \u201ccrazy Stormy Daniels deal\u201d. Reuters reported that Giuliani said Cohen\u2019s actions reflected a \u201cpattern of lies and dishonesty\u201d over a significant period of time. Some more on the comments Trump made as he landed in West Virginia. He told reporters: \u201cPaul Manafort\u2019s a good man,\u201d adding: \u201cHe was with Ronald Reagan, he was with a lot of people.\u201d The US president portrayed the Manafort prosecution, which grew out of an FBI investigation predating the 2016 campaign, as an unnatural outgrowth of the investigation being carried out by special counsel Robert Mueller. \u201cThis has nothing to do with Russian collusion,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThese are witch hunts and it\u2019s a disgrace. This has nothing to do \u2013 it started out looking for Russians in our campaign and there were none.\u201d Standing on the windswept airport tarmac, he continued: \u201cThis is the way it ends up. It was not the original mission, believe me. It had nothing to do with Russian collusion, we continue the witch hunt.\u201d He then walked off to the waiting car, ignoring shouts from reporters requesting comment on the Michael Cohen case. Donald Trump just spoke to reporters outside of Air Force One after landing in Charleston, West Virginia. He commented briefly on the Manafort guilty verdict, calling it \u201cvery sad\u201d and noting that it had \u201c nothing to do\u201d with Russian collusion. \u201cWe continue the witch hunt,\u201d he said. He did not respond to questions about Cohen. The Guardian\u2019s Erin Durkin has updates from the federal court in Manhattan. Cohen stood and plead guilty to charges, including that in October 2016, he, in coordination with \u201cthe candidate\u201d arranged to make a payment to an \u201cindividual with information that would be harmful to the candidate and to the campaign.\u201d Cohen said he used a company that was under his control to make the payment of $130,000 and those monies were later repaid to me by the candidate and that this was done \u201cfor the principal purpose of influencing the election.\u201d US attorney Robert Khuzami just addressed the press outside the New York courtroom where Cohen pleaded guilty. Khuzami spoke extensively about one of the most shocking charges, which stems from a payment Cohen made to silence two women \u201cthat he believed would be detrimental\u201d to a candidate in the 2016 presidential election. Khuzami said Cohen sought reimbursement for paying off the two woman by submitting invoices to the candidate\u2019s company that were \u201cuntrue and false\u201d. Khuzami ignored shouted questions from reporters asking who the candidate he referred to is. Cohen is Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer. And Trump in April said Cohen represented him in the \u201ccrazy Stormy Daniels deal\u201d. Paul Manafort stood stonefaced as he was found guilty on eight counts of filing false tax returns and bank fraud. The jury deadlocked on the other ten counts of fraud that Manafort had been charged with. The only visible emotion that Manafort, the former Trump campaign manager, displayed was when he winked at his wife Kathleen upon leaving the courtroom. After the sentencing, federal judge TS Ellis III praised attorneys both for the government and for Manafort for their \u201ceffective and zealous representations.\u201d Donald Trump is holding a rally in West Virginia tonight. He did not respond to shouted questions about Cohen, according to the pool report, but gave a thumbs up before boarding Air Force One to West Virginia. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Crew) executive director Noah Bookbinder, a former federal prosecutor, released the following statement on the Paul Manafort verdict: The president\u2019s former campaign chairman has just been convicted of very serious crimes. Paul Manafort engaged in corrupt behavior and illicit self-enrichment for years, and it appears he tried to use the Trump campaign as a way to get out of a major financial hole. It remains to be seen how many others in the orbit of the Trump campaign and administration are implicated in corrupt conduct; it seems far too prevalent. We applaud the Department of Justice on this important conviction. This is just the latest conviction for Special Counsel Mueller\u2019s investigation, as multiple defendants have already pleaded guilty, and it likely will not be the last. This investigation is moving quickly and effectively, and it will continue bringing us closer to the truth. Within minutes of Manafort\u2019s conviction, Cohen plead guilty to campaign finance violations including payoffs to women, bank fraud and tax fraud. The vice-chair of the Senate intelligence committee, Mark Warner, a Democrat who is helping lead the Senate\u2019s Russia investigation, has a statement about Manafort\u2019s conviction: This verdict makes it absolutely clear that the Mueller probe is not a \u2018witch hunt\u2019 \u2014 it is a serious investigation that is rooting out corruption and Russian influence on our political system at the highest levels. The President\u2019s campaign manager was just convicted of serious federal crimes by a jury of his peers, despite the President\u2019s continued attempts to undermine the investigation which has brought Mr. Manafort to justice. Any attempt by the President to pardon Mr. Manafort or interfere in the investigation into his campaign would be a gross abuse of power and require immediate action by Congress. A deluge of news from the Cohen and Manafort courtrooms ... For Manafort, the judge has said guilty on eight of eighteen counts. A mistrial on 10 counts. How dangerous is Cohen for Trump? This excellent piece by Tom McCarthy has some answers. Apart from what he might be able to tell Mueller, the former aide could provide evidence of alleged elections law violations by the Trump campaign, legal analysts say. Or Cohen could damage Trump politically, exploding the president\u2019s credibility \u2013 what remains of it \u2013 in a way that would change the basic picture of the man and his leadership. Cohen is not the only former Trump aide at a federal courthouse today, writes the Guardian\u2019s Ben Jacobs, who is currently outside court in Alexandria, Virginia. Jacobs is awaiting a verdict for the trial of former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort on 18 counts of bank and tax fraud. Jurors sent a note earlier in the day to ask what would happen if they were deadlocked on only one of the 18 counts, leading to the belief that they have reached consensus on the other 17. In the meantime, reporters and lawyers are camped out in the lobby of a hotel across the street. In between the hotel and the courthouse, an outdoor plaza has transformed into a vast television studio filled with a dozen television cameras set up for cable news liveshots. Cohen has entered the courtroom, according to local New York Daily News reporter Stephen Brown. And the Associated Press said Cohen was seen leaving his apartment earlier and \u201ctraveling to the Manhattan offices of one of his lawyer, former federal prosecutor Guy Petrillo, before going into a building where the FBI has its New York offices.\u201d Sam Nunberg, a former Trump aide, brushed off Cohen\u2019s guilty plea as unimportant in the larger scheme of things. \u201cUnless I see a direct correlation and coordination on hacking of the emails, I don\u2019t see what this does for getting the president removed from office,\u201d said Nunberg. He saw this as a continuation of \u201cMueller playing Watergate\u201d and trying to bring down Trump. Nunberg noted that once after a television interview, he was informed by the special counsel\u2019s office that prosecutors in the southern district were thinking about calling him. Although he never testified there, he saw it as an extension of the same effort, noting Mueller\u2019s team has limited bandwidth and may not have jurisdiction in some cases. Nunberg also dismissed concerns that Cohen paid off women on Trump\u2019s behalf. \u201cSo what do they [the prosecutors] have?\u201d Nunberg said. \u201cThat Cohen paid off a woman and Trump told him to? My argument would be Trump has done this before, this wasn\u2019t his first rodeo doing this.\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen is due to appear in a New York court at 4pm ET after reaching a plea deal with prosecutors investigating him for alleged financial fraud and other charges. Cohen intends to plead guilty to at least one charge, according to multiple news organizations. We\u2019ll have analysis and details on the court hearing, which is less than 15 minutes away.

The radical move has cross-party support from Ardern\u2019s coalition partners, as well as the opposition National party. MPs\u2019 salaries and allowances would be frozen till July 2019, Ardern said, while \u201ca fairer formula for future pay increases\u201d is developed for those in politics, who earn between NZ$163,000 ($108,000) to more than NZ$450,000 ($300,000). Ardern said the freeze was \u201cthe right thing to do\u201d and was not about cost-cutting, but making New Zealand a more equitable nation. The PM was prompted to take action after the Remuneration Authority recommended MPs receive a 3% pay rise, in a year that is seeing widespread strike action by teachers, nurses and other workers across New Zealand. Ardern earns more than NZ$450,000 a year, making her the fifth-highest paid leader in the OECD, and better paid than Canada\u2019s Justin Trudeau and the UK\u2019s Theresa May. According to a survey by Stuff, 62% of New Zealanders think the country\u2019s prime ministers are paid too much.

          "bodyText": "It\u2019s a country that regularly ranks among the best places to live, and is often lauded for its tolerance and quality of life. But this week, a very different view of Canada has been peddled online amid an escalating diplomatic row between the two countries. Soon after Saudi Arabia announced that Canada\u2019s ambassador to the kingdom was now persona non grata, a surge of Saudi Twitter accounts began expressing concerns about Canada\u2019s treatment of indigenous peoples. Others \u2013 using strikingly similar language \u2013 threw their support behind Quebec sovereignty, backing a sentiment that has faded in recent years. As Saudi officials criticised Canada for interference in its internal affairs, some lauded the kingdom\u2019s restraint when it comes to Canadian issues. \u201cSaudi Arabia could have easily supported the 1995 Quebec independence referendum through the funding of media campaigns and attacks against the Canadian government to secure a Quebecan (sic) victory,\u201d noted one tweet. It added: \u201cBut we do not meddle in other nations\u2019 domestic affairs, clearly, unlike Canada.\u201d The nationalistic fervour playing out online was laid bare after a Saudi organisation apologised for a tweet showing a plane flying towards Toronto\u2019s CN tower, in what appeared to be a reference to a 9/11 style attack. The mixture of outlandish claims and genuine criticism continued on Saudi-owned media outlet Al Arabiya, where guests were trotted out to make wild claims that ranged from accusing Canada of supporting terrorism to having the world\u2019s highest rates of female persecution. Another segment listed off supposed prisoners of conscience in Canada, including Ernst Z\u00fcndel \u2013 a German holocaust denier who was detained for two years in Canada before he was deported to Germany were he died last year \u2013 and controversial academic Jordan Peterson. Peterson responded to the report on Thursday, tweeting: \u201cHelp! I\u2019m being held prisoner in Canada,\u201d before touting an upcoming visit to Saskatchewan to promote his book. The outlet also offered a detailed look at Canadian prisons, mixing in legitimate issues such as the excessive use of solitary confinement with the claim that, between 2015 and 2017, some 75% of prisoners in Canada died before their case. Meanwhile state-run media in Saudi Arabia said on Wednesday that the country had executed and \u201ccrucified\u201d a man convicted of killing a woman and carrying out other crimes. In recent days Saudi officials have continued to escalate the row; making plans to move thousands of Saudi students and medical patients out of Canada, suspending flights to and from Canada on the state airline and halting purchases of grains originating from Canada by the country\u2019s main state wheat buying agency. The spat appeared to have been sparked last week when Canada\u2019s foreign ministry expressed its concern over the arrest of Saudi civil society and women\u2019s rights activists. On Wednesday Justin Trudeau, Canada\u2019s prime minister, said his government was engaging with Saudi Arabia to resolve the spat but stood firm on Canada\u2019s stance. \u201cWe will, at the same time, continue to speak clearly and firmly on issues of human rights at home and abroad wherever we see the need.\u201d",

He did not elaborate on what these measures could entail.</p> <p>\u201cCanada needs to fix its big mistake,\u201d Adel al-Jubeir told a news conference in Riyadh. \u201cThere is nothing to mediate. A mistake has been made and a mistake should be corrected.\u201d</p> <p>In recent days, several countries have expressed support for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/saudiarabia\">Saudi Arabia</a>, including Egypt and Russia, which both told Ottawa that it was unacceptable to lecture the kingdom on human rights.</p> <p>\u201cWe have always said that the politicisation of human rights matters is unacceptable,\u201d Maria Zakharova, a spokesperson for Russia\u2019s foreign ministry, told reporters on Wednesday. \u201cWhat one probably needs in this situation is constructive advice and assistance rather than criticism from a \u2018moral superior\u2019,\u201d she added.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the United States \u2013 one of Canada\u2019s closest allies \u2013 has so far refused to wade into the row, describing both countries as close allies in a written statement from the state department.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s up for the government of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/saudiarabia\">Saudi Arabia</a> and the Canadians to work this out,\u201d said Heather Nauert, a spokesperson for the state department, on Tuesday. \u201cBoth sides need to diplomatically resolve this together.

          "bodyText": "Justin Trudeau has defied Saudi Arabia\u2019s demand to withdraw Canada\u2019s calls for the release of jailed civil rights activists and insisted that Canada will continue to defend human rights around the world, suggesting that the escalating diplomatic row between the two countries is set to continue. In his first public comments since the spat began, Canada\u2019s prime minister said his government has been speaking directly to the kingdom in an effort to resolve what he called \u201ca diplomatic difference of opinion\u201d. Trudeau said Canada\u2019s foreign minister had held a long conversation with her Saudi counterpart on Tuesday, but offered no details as to what the pair had discussed. \u201cWe continue to engage diplomatically and politically with the government of Saudi Arabia,\u201d Trudeau told reporters on Wednesday. \u201cWe have respect for their importance in the world and recognise that they have made progress on a number of important issues.\u201d He insisted, however, that his government would continue to press Saudi Arabia on its human rights record. \u201cWe will, at the same time, continue to speak clearly and firmly on issues of human rights at home and abroad wherever we see the need.\u201d Trudeau\u2019s comments came hours after Saudi Arabia\u2019s foreign minister described the row as a \u201cmatter of national security,\u201d telling reporters that the kingdom was still considering additional measures against Canada. He did not elaborate on what these measures could entail. \u201cCanada needs to fix its big mistake,\u201d Adel al-Jubeir told a news conference in Riyadh. \u201cThere is nothing to mediate. A mistake has been made and a mistake should be corrected.\u201d In recent days, several countries have expressed support for Saudi Arabia, including Egypt and Russia, which both told Ottawa that it was unacceptable to lecture the kingdom on human rights. \u201cWe have always said that the politicisation of human rights matters is unacceptable,\u201d Maria Zakharova, a spokesperson for Russia\u2019s foreign ministry, told reporters on Wednesday. \u201cWhat one probably needs in this situation is constructive advice and assistance rather than criticism from a \u2018moral superior\u2019,\u201d she added. Meanwhile, the United States \u2013 one of Canada\u2019s closest allies \u2013 has so far refused to wade into the row, describing both countries as close allies in a written statement from the state department. \u201cIt\u2019s up for the government of Saudi Arabia and the Canadians to work this out,\u201d said Heather Nauert, a spokesperson for the state department, on Tuesday. \u201cBoth sides need to diplomatically resolve this together. We can\u2019t do it for them.\u201d The United Kingdom was similarly muted in its response, with a foreign office spokesperson saying: \u201cCanada and Saudi Arabia are both close partners of the UK, and we urge restraint during the current situation,\u201d a foreign office spokeswoman said. When asked whether Canada was prepared to apologise to Saudi Arabia, Trudeau \u2013 who in recent years has come under fire for signing off on the sale of more than 900 armoured vehicles to Riyadh \u2013 skirted the question. \u201cCanadians have always expected our government to speak strongly and firmly, clearly and politely, about the need to respect human rights around the world. We will continue to do that,\u201d he said. He also dodged a question about the perceived reluctance of the US administration to back Canada in the dispute. \u201cWe recognise that every country has the right to make their own decisions when it comes to diplomacy and international relations,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m never going to impose on another country what their reactions should be or what their response should be.\u201d The spat appeared to have been sparked last week when Canada\u2019s foreign ministry expressed its concern over the arrest of Saudi civil society and women\u2019s rights activists. Saudi Arabia shot back on Sunday, expelling the Canadian ambassador and freezing new trade with Canada. In the days following the kingdom has continued to pile on measures against Canada, including plans to remove thousands of Saudi students and medical patients from Canada and the suspension of flights to and from Canada on Saudi Arabia\u2019s state airline. Saudi Arabia\u2019s main state wheat buying agency, the Saudi Grains Organization, has also told grains exporters it will no longer accept Canadian-origin grains in its international purchase tenders, while the Saudi central bank instructed its asset managers overseas to dispose of Canadian equity, bonds and cash holdings, regardless of the cost, according to the Financial Times. Analysts and regional officials say that Riyadh\u2019s actions have little to do with Canada; instead, the kingdom\u2019s actions are a broader signal to western governments that any criticism of its domestic policies is unacceptable. As Saudi-Canadian trade hovers around $4bn, the country was likely seen as an easy fall guy in the kingdom\u2019s bid to reinforce this message, said Bessma Momani, a political science professor at Canada\u2019s University of Waterloo. \u201cCanada is an easy target because our bilateral economic ties are limited.\u201d Saudi Arabia\u2019s actions likely had the tacit support of Washington, particularly as they targeted Trudeau \u2013 a self-declared feminist who has loudly championed progressive policies, she said. \u201cAnd let\u2019s be honest, the Trump administration, particularly Donald Trump, who has shown animosity to Justin Trudeau, is probably not too sad to see having this government be in the international limelight and be rebuked by the Saudis.\u201d Others have contexualised the kingdom\u2019s actions as part of a bold new foreign policy unleashed by the country\u2019s powerful crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. Projecting strength has become a central concern of the 32-year-old heir to the throne. So has upsetting allies, and starting rows without an apparent follow-up plan. Meanwhile state-run media in Saudi Arabia said the country had executed and \u201ccrucified\u201d a man from Myanmar convicted of killing a woman and carrying out other crimes. When asked on Wednesday about its decision to arrest the activists at the heart of the diplomatic row, Saudi Arabia\u2019s foreign minister said that charges against them would be made public once their cases reach the courts and repeated earlier allegations that they had been in touch with foreign entities.

          "bodyText": "Saudi Arabia\u2019s latest diplomatic spat began with a tweet and very quickly escalated to include the expulsion of an ambassador, the suspension of flights and a freeze on trade deals. But analysts and regional officials say that Riyadh\u2019s actions have little to do with Canada; instead, the kingdom\u2019s actions are a broader signal to western governments that any criticism of its domestic policies is unacceptable. The row began with an expression of concern by Canada\u2019s foreign ministry over the arrest of Saudi civil society and women\u2019s rights activists. In years past, such a public criticism from an ally would have been dealt with behind the kingdom\u2019s famously opaque closed doors. But as Canada\u2019s envoy heads home, the feeling among diplomats in Riyadh and elsewhere in the Arab world is that Saudi Arabia\u2019s new leadership wants to assert a new set of rules on the regional game. And the country\u2019s powerful crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, feels he has the backing to do it. Projecting strength has become a central concern of the 32-year-old heir to the throne. So has upsetting allies, and starting rows without an apparent follow-up plan. The new Saudi thinking is that its largesse has been abused and its allies \u2013 particularly Barack Obama \u2013 have let it down. Donald Trump\u2019s arrival in the White House changed all that. And the US president\u2019s stance towards the kingdom \u2013 and foreign policy in general \u2013 has given Riyadh great comfort. Not only does the Trump administration refuse to discuss human rights with its friends or foes, the issue seems of very little interest to him. US reaction to the row has so far been distinctly noncommittal. State department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said on Tuesday that the US has raised the activists\u2019 arrests with the Saudi government \u2013 but she declined to explicitly condemn the detentions. Nauert also refused to wade into the escalating row between its two allies. \u201cIt\u2019s up for the government of Saudi Arabia and the Canadians to work this out,\u201d she said. \u201cBoth sides need to diplomatically resolve this together. We can\u2019t do it for them.\u201d With Trump in the White House, the kingdom knows that it has free rein to handle its domestic affairs \u2013 and its foreign policy \u2013 as it pleases, with no public challenge from Washington. Saudi\u2019s diplomatic quagmire in Qatar and its ongoing war in impoverished Yemen have been brushed aside by Trump and even encouraged by his son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner. Over the past two years, Kushner and Bin Salman have spent much time in each others company. Together they have pledged to overcome some of the Middle East\u2019s most sensitive issues including the Israeli/Palestinian peace process and the growing reach of Iran. But the world\u2019s two most powerful 30-somethings have not gained much traction on either issue. Kushner has no background in diplomacy and a worldview rooted in \u201cuser pays\u201d \u2013 not hectoring anyone about how to run a country. Bin Salman\u2019s approach has been to table comprehensive reforms, including some civic freedoms, but to brook no dissent in return. Political freedoms remain next to non-existent in the kingdom, and power is even more centralised than it was under previous Saudi leaders. In this context, Canada has inadvertently become a vehicle for a broader message: \u201cDon\u2019t challenge us on domestic affairs.\u201d Female activists are accused of speaking to foreign governments and reporters \u2013potentially subversive moves when you\u2019re trying to reshape a country. Many of those detained had been vocal campaigners to overturn of the female driving ban \u2013 a watershed moment that finally arrived in June. But rather than allow the activists to claim credit for forcing the ban to be lifted, Saudi officials were determined to position the move as a gift bestowed from on high. Political defiance remains a taboo in the \u201cnew\u201d Saudi Arabia. Robust advice from allies is getting there too. The government of Justin Trudeau has not been alone in expressing support for Saudi dissidents, but Canada was likely targeted because Saudi Arabia judged it had less to lose by lashing out.

Authorities identified the suspect as Faisal Hussain, 29, of Toronto, who died after an exchange of gunfire with police. It was not immediately clear whether he killed himself or was killed by police. Police said an 18-year-old woman and a 10-year-old girl, both of them from the Toronto area, were killed in the attack. The 18-year-old was later identified as Reese Fallon. She had graduated high school last month and \u201cwas highly regarded by staff and loved by her friends\u201d, Toronto\u2019s mayor, John Tory, said in a statement. Another 13 people, ranging in age 10 to 59 years, remain in hospital, with injuries ranging from minor to serious. Of the 15 victims in the attack, eight were women and girls. The 29-year-old suspected gunman was found dead in a nearby alley after a brief exchange of gunfire with police, though it remains unclear how he died. Police have yet to speculate on a motive for the shooting. Emergency services rushed to a Toronto area known as Greektown at about 10pm on Sunday night. A shooting spree, lasting minutes and spanning several blocks, had sparked terror in the busy area. Diners enjoying a balmy evening scrambled to take cover, Andrew Mantzios told the Globe and Mail.

But one voice has consistently lauded the US president: Conrad Black, the man who once controlled one of the world\u2019s largest English-language newspaper empires. From his home in Toronto, Black has emerged as one of the president\u2019s most outspoken supporters, arguing America\u2019s 45th president is exactly what the US needed. \u201cI think he\u2019s done quite well,\u201d said Black, rattling off a list of claims that have been widely challenged \u2013 or proven to be untrue. \u201cI think you would have to say that he\u2019s cut illegal immigration by 50%, he\u2019s certainly produced economic progress and has dealt effectively with the greatest single foreign policy issue so far: North Korea.\u201d Such assertions reflect the breezy, positive spin that is at the heart of Black\u2019s latest book, Donald J Trump: A President Like No Other.

The Charity Commission is investigating Save the Children\u2019s mishandling of sexual misconduct and inappropriate behaviour allegations against its former chief executive, Justin Forsyth, and former policy director, Brendan Cox. Speaking about the charity\u2019s broader response to sexual exploitation and abuse of children in humanitarian settings, Watkins admitted to MPs that the charity had failed to dedicate adequate resources to safeguarding. Child aid expert Corinna Cs\u00e1ky, who has investigated sexual abuse in humanitarian settings, said there had been two decades of reports on the problem but a failure to act: \u201cPeople feel they have no one to turn to.\u201d </p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Claws are out \u2013 </strong>That and similar puns abound after the man with the world\u2019s longest fingernails finally cut them off.

Big crowds are expected in London on Friday, when the giant \u201cTrump baby\u201d balloon caricaturing the president as a nappy-wearing, phone-clutching infant, will be hoisted above Westminster.

A 2-1 extra-time defeat to Croatia and the dream is dashed for another four years. But let\u2019s not have any anguish this time. Harry Kane admitted the defeat \u201cwill hurt for a while\u201d but immediate reaction to the result has been largely positive. Gareth Southgate praised his young side for surpassing expectations and can take credit for relighting the nation\u2019s fire. So chin up, England \u2013 here are more reasons to be cheerful. And while they failed to kill off Croatia in an enterprising start to the game in Moscow, the future appears to be bright and they will be stronger for the experience in Russia. Meanwhile, Croatia captain Luka Modri\u0107 has admitted his teammates used criticisms and a lack of respect from English pundits to motivate them to a victory which sparked jubilant scenes in Zagreb. Croatia will now play France in Sunday\u2019s final, while England meet Belgium for a second time this tournament in Saturday\u2019s third-place playoff. * * * War of the white papers \u2013 Brexiters have unveiled their latest weapon to foil Theresa May\u2019s Chequers plan: an alternative document drawn up by David Davis before he resigned from the cabinet.

Labour\u2019s equalities committee adopted the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition but failed to include some formal examples of antisemitism, such as claiming the existence of a state of Israel is racist, and comparing Israeli actions to the Nazis. Jennie Formby, the Labour general secretary, has argued Labour should not adopt wording that could exempt the Israeli state or Israeli policy from legitimate criticism. Labour\u2019s full national executive is to meet on Tuesday. * * * Aid scandal fallout \u2013 The head of Save the Children, Kevin Watkins, has been forced to defend his position as chief executive of the charity amid accusations that he is part of a cosy boys\u2019 club. The Charity Commission is investigating Save the Children\u2019s mishandling of sexual misconduct and inappropriate behaviour allegations against its former chief executive, Justin Forsyth, and former policy director, Brendan Cox. Speaking about the charity\u2019s broader response to sexual exploitation and abuse of children in humanitarian settings, Watkins admitted to MPs that the charity had failed to dedicate adequate resources to safeguarding. Child aid expert Corinna Cs\u00e1ky, who has investigated sexual abuse in humanitarian settings, said there had been two decades of reports on the problem but a failure to act: \u201cPeople feel they have no one to turn to.\u201d * * * Claws are out \u2013 That and similar puns abound after the man with the world\u2019s longest fingernails finally cut them off. Shridhar Chillal, 82, from Pune, India, had to have them removed with a power tool. When last measured they had a combined length of just over nine metres \u2013 about the same length as a London bus. They have been put on display at Ripley\u2019s Believe It or Not! Museum in Times Square, New York. Lunchtime read: Obama as gumshoe This is fun: the 44th president taking time out from kayaking with Justin Trudeau to dig into the death of Joe Biden\u2019s favourite train conductor. With the former vice-president playing the Watson to his Sherlock, Obama infiltrates a biker gang and searches crime scenes as they also dig into the sinister forces driving an opioid epidemic in the US. \u201cIt\u2019s a tiny bit ridiculous,\u201d admits publisher Jason Rekulak, \u201cbut is it any more ridiculous than the real-life political events of the past year? Hope Never Dies is by Andrew Shaffer, and published by Quirk Books. Sport Roger Federer\u2019s spell over Wimbledon broke when he finally lost a set for the first time since 8 July 2016 and then went on to lose one of the great All England Club dogfights to Kevin Anderson. No one saw it coming. Elsewhere, Novak Djokovic broke Kei Nishikori\u2019s resistance to book a date in the semis with Rafael Nadal, who showed his warrior spirit to beat Juan Mart\u00edn Del Potro. Tensions at the Tour de France around Chris Froome and his Sky teammates showed little sign of abating as the defending champion was booed once again at the start village for stage five. Alex Hales, who has been the driving force behind two world\u2011record totals at Trent Bridge but looks set to be dropped for England\u2019s one-day series opener against India today. And Stephen Curry has brushed off suggestions that the Golden State Warriors\u2019 dominance has negatively affected the NBA. Business Asian stock markets have risen after Wall Street fell yesterday. Oil prices recovered some of the previous day\u2019s steep losses. China has warned of \u201cfirm and forceful measures\u201d if Donald Trump administration goes ahead $200bn more in tariffs. The pound has been trading at $1.320 and \u20ac1.130 overnight. The papers A million front pages could not mop up the tears of English football today. But we present them regardless \u2013 today in the form of a special round-up where you can see them for yourself, as well our usual summary which follows. Most papers give over more or less their whole fronts, of course, to the England players coming to terms with their defeat. The Times produces a wraparound focusing solely on the match. \u201cPride of lions\u201d says a small, boxed, white-on-black headline that lets a picture of Gareth Southgate consoling Harry Kane do most of the talking. The Telegraph has exactly the same headline. In the Guardian it\u2019s \u201cEnd of the dream \u2013 England out of the World Cup\u201d with a full-page pic of a Southgate-Walker embrace. \u201cHeroes \u2013 we\u2019re proud of you all \u2026\u201d says the Mirror, and the Express strikes a similar tone: \u201cWe lived the dream \u2026 thank you England\u201d. \u201cYes, it all ended in tears \u2026\u201d starts the Mail headline, \u201cbut they gave us pride and brought the whole nation together\u201d \u2013 an allusion, no doubt, to Brexit\u2019s divisiveness. The Metro calls it a \u201cKick in the Balkans\u201d which doesn\u2019t really work when you think about it. Finally the FT tops them all with a real tearjerker \u2013 \u201cMay ditches hope of keeping City in tight tie-up with EU after Brexit\u201d \u2013 and I am out of breath after that so goodbye.

The two men hugged and laughed in scenes unthinkable just months ago.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to exaggerate but for Ethiopia, a country where everything has been done in a very prescriptive, slow and managed way, these changes are unprecedented,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.chathamhouse.org/expert/comment/ethiopia-s-prime-minister-shows-knack-balancing-reform-and-continuity\">Ahmed Soliman</a>, an expert in East African politics at London\u2019s Chatham House. \u201cHis main task is to satisfy all expectations of all groups in a huge and diverse country. That\u2019s impossible but he\u2019s trying to do so with some gusto.\u201d</p> <p>Despite an International Monetary Fund forecast predicting that Ethiopia would be the fastest-growing economy in sub-Saharan Africa in 2018, even the officially sanctioned press has admitted the country\u2019s serious difficulties.</p> <p>The Addis Ababa-based Reporter described \u201cthe spectre of catastrophe hanging over Ethiopia\u201d and called on the new prime minister to pull the nation \u201cback from the brink\u201d.</p> <p>Ethiopia is facing a critical shortage of foreign currency, only temporarily solved by an infusion of cash from the United Arab Emirates. There is growing inequality, a shortage of jobs for a huge number of graduates, significant environmental damage, ethnic tensions and a hunger for change.</p> <p>Different interest groups have come together in recent years to constitute a powerful groundswell of discontent, with widespread anti-government protests led by young people. At least 70% of the population is below the age of 30.</p> <p>\u201cThe youth [are] the active force behind the country\u2019s growth. Now there must be a new model to make Ethiopia progress economically by creating more job opportunities for the youth while respecting political and civil rights,\u201d said Befeqadu Hailu, a 37-year-old blogger jailed repeatedly for his pro-democracy writings.</p> <p>Abiy has apologised for previous abuses and promised an end to the harassment.</p> <p>\u201cI have always lived in fear but I feel less threatened when I write than I did before,\u201d Hailu said. \u201cIt\u2019s not only his word \u2026 the moment he spoke those words the security personnel down to the local levels have changed.\u201d</p> <p>But not all back Abiy\u2019s efforts. Last month, a grenade was thrown at a rally organised to showcase popular support for the reforms in Addis Ababa\u2019s vast Meskel Square, where many among the tens of thousands supporters wore clothes displaying the new prime minister\u2019s image and carried signs saying \u201cone love, one Ethiopia\u201d. Two people died and more than 150 were injured in the blast and the stampede that followed.</p> <p>\u201cLove always wins. Killing others is a defeat. To those who tried to divide us, I want to tell you that you have not succeeded,\u201d Abiy said in an address shortly after the attack.</p> <p>Officials said there had been other efforts to disrupt the rally, including a power outage and a partial shutdown of the phone network. At least 30 civilians and nine police officers were arrested.</p> <p>Since Abiy took power, there have been \u201corganised attempts to cause economic harm, create inflation[ary] flare-up and disrupt the service delivery of public enterprises\u201d, state media said.</p> <p>One possible culprit could be a hardline element within Ethiopia\u2019s powerful security services \u2013 Abiy has replaced military heads with civilians and admitted past human rights abuses. Another could be a faction opposed to the effort to find peace with Eritrea.</p> <p>Strafor, a US-based consultancy, said the perpetrators of the \u201camateurish\u201d attack were more likely to be from one of Ethiopia\u2019s restive regions.</p> <p>The Ethiopian People\u2019s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), the rebel coalition that ousted the Derg military regime in 1991, is split by factional battles between four ethnically based parties as well as fierce competition between institutions and individuals.</p> <p>Tigrayans, an ethnic community centred in the north of Ethiopia, make up about 6% of the population but are generally considered to dominate the political and business elite.</p> <p>Abiy was seen as a relative political outsider <a href=\"http://addisstandard.com/breaking-dr-abiy-ahmed-elected-new-chairman-of-eprdf-deputy-not-decided/\">before being picked for the top job by the EPRDF council</a>. He is the first leader from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/mar/13/freedom-oromo-activists-qeerroo-ethiopia-standstill\">Ethiopia\u2019s largest ethnic community, the Oromo</a>, who have complained for decades of economic, cultural and political marginalisation.</p> <p>Born in western Ethiopia, Abiy joined the resistance against the regime of Mengistu Haile Mariam as a teenager before enlisting in the armed forces, reaching the rank of lieutenant-colonel.

          "bodyText": "Abiy Ahmed, the prime minister of Ethiopia, has accelerated a radical reform programme that is overturning politics in the vast, strategically significant African country. Since coming to power as prime minister in April, Abiy has electrified Ethiopia with his informal style, charisma and energy, earning comparisons to Nelson Mandela, Justin Trudeau, Barack Obama and Mikhail Gorbachev. The 42-year-old \u2013 who took power following the surprise resignation of his predecessor, Haile Mmariam Dessalegn \u2013 has so far reshuffled his cabinet, fired a series of controversial and hitherto untouchable civil servants, reached out to hostile neighbours and rivals, lifted bans on websites and other media, freed thousands of political prisoners, ordered the partial privatisation of massive state-owned companies and ended a state of emergency imposed to quell widespread unrest. In recent days, Abiy fired the head of Ethiopia\u2019s prison service after repeated allegations of widespread torture, and removed three opposition groups from its lists of \u201cterrorist\u201d organisations. On Sunday, the former soldier met president Isaiah Afwerki of Eritrea in a bid to end one of Africa\u2019s longest running conflicts. The two men hugged and laughed in scenes unthinkable just months ago. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to exaggerate but for Ethiopia, a country where everything has been done in a very prescriptive, slow and managed way, these changes are unprecedented,\u201d said Ahmed Soliman, an expert in East African politics at London\u2019s Chatham House. \u201cHis main task is to satisfy all expectations of all groups in a huge and diverse country. That\u2019s impossible but he\u2019s trying to do so with some gusto.\u201d Despite an International Monetary Fund forecast predicting that Ethiopia would be the fastest-growing economy in sub-Saharan Africa in 2018, even the officially sanctioned press has admitted the country\u2019s serious difficulties. The Addis Ababa-based Reporter described \u201cthe spectre of catastrophe hanging over Ethiopia\u201d and called on the new prime minister to pull the nation \u201cback from the brink\u201d. Ethiopia is facing a critical shortage of foreign currency, only temporarily solved by an infusion of cash from the United Arab Emirates. There is growing inequality, a shortage of jobs for a huge number of graduates, significant environmental damage, ethnic tensions and a hunger for change. Different interest groups have come together in recent years to constitute a powerful groundswell of discontent, with widespread anti-government protests led by young people. At least 70% of the population is below the age of 30. \u201cThe youth [are] the active force behind the country\u2019s growth. Now there must be a new model to make Ethiopia progress economically by creating more job opportunities for the youth while respecting political and civil rights,\u201d said Befeqadu Hailu, a 37-year-old blogger jailed repeatedly for his pro-democracy writings. Abiy has apologised for previous abuses and promised an end to the harassment. \u201cI have always lived in fear but I feel less threatened when I write than I did before,\u201d Hailu said. \u201cIt\u2019s not only his word \u2026 the moment he spoke those words the security personnel down to the local levels have changed.\u201d But not all back Abiy\u2019s efforts. Last month, a grenade was thrown at a rally organised to showcase popular support for the reforms in Addis Ababa\u2019s vast Meskel Square, where many among the tens of thousands supporters wore clothes displaying the new prime minister\u2019s image and carried signs saying \u201cone love, one Ethiopia\u201d. Two people died and more than 150 were injured in the blast and the stampede that followed. \u201cLove always wins. Killing others is a defeat. To those who tried to divide us, I want to tell you that you have not succeeded,\u201d Abiy said in an address shortly after the attack. Officials said there had been other efforts to disrupt the rally, including a power outage and a partial shutdown of the phone network. At least 30 civilians and nine police officers were arrested. Since Abiy took power, there have been \u201corganised attempts to cause economic harm, create inflation[ary] flare-up and disrupt the service delivery of public enterprises\u201d, state media said. One possible culprit could be a hardline element within Ethiopia\u2019s powerful security services \u2013 Abiy has replaced military heads with civilians and admitted past human rights abuses. Another could be a faction opposed to the effort to find peace with Eritrea. Strafor, a US-based consultancy, said the perpetrators of the \u201camateurish\u201d attack were more likely to be from one of Ethiopia\u2019s restive regions. The Ethiopian People\u2019s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), the rebel coalition that ousted the Derg military regime in 1991, is split by factional battles between four ethnically based parties as well as fierce competition between institutions and individuals. Tigrayans, an ethnic community centred in the north of Ethiopia, make up about 6% of the population but are generally considered to dominate the political and business elite. Abiy was seen as a relative political outsider before being picked for the top job by the EPRDF council. He is the first leader from Ethiopia\u2019s largest ethnic community, the Oromo, who have complained for decades of economic, cultural and political marginalisation. Born in western Ethiopia, Abiy joined the resistance against the regime of Mengistu Haile Mariam as a teenager before enlisting in the armed forces, reaching the rank of lieutenant-colonel. He has a doctorate in peace and security studies. After a stint running Ethiopia\u2019s cyberintelligence service, he entered politics eight years ago and rose rapidly up the ranks of the Oromo faction of the EPRDF, which has historically been at odds with the Tigrayans. Analysts say Abiy\u2019s mixed Christian and Muslim background, and fluency in three of the country\u2019s main languages allow the new leader to bridge communal and sectarian divides. He has also reached out to women, making an unprecedented mention of his wife and mother in his acceptance speech. One personal acquaintance described the new prime minister as \u201calways looking ahead for the future\u201d. \u201cHe is also a good listener but with a bit of headstrong attitude towards people who don\u2019t deliver,\u201d said Yosef Tiruneh, a communications specialist who worked under Abiy at the science and technology ministry. Tiruneh, said shelves of books on religion, philosophy and science filled Abiy\u2019s office. \u201cHe is physically active and very well organised ... He did not have a secretary because he wanted his office to be accessible. His office door was literally never closed.\u201d Andargachew Tsege, a British citizen unexpectedly pardoned in May after four years on death row on alleged terrorism charges, said Abiy was \u201cvery intelligent and a quick learner\u201d who was committed to democratisation. \u201cAbiy invited me to meet him two days after my release. We spoke for 90 minutes and a lot of issues were discussed. It was a meeting of minds. This guy means business,\u201d Tsege, who was abducted by Ethiopian security services while in transit in Yemen four years ago, said. But some point out that the autocratic nature of decision-making in Ethiopia has yet to change, even if Abiy is using his new powers to reform. \u201cThe country is still being led by one person and his cabinet,\u201d said Tigist Mengistu, an executive in Addis Ababa. \u201cSadly we have been there for 27 years and we want that to change. It is bad for a country as diverse as Ethiopia,\u201d she said. Additional reporting by Hadra Ahmed in Addis Ababa",

          "body": "<p>This week will feature a record-breaker: the most expensive game of amateur golf in British, and probably world, history. A \u00a35m price tag is being put on the Scottish leg of Donald Trump\u2019s visit to these shores.</p> <p>The Edinburgh government has been told that the Westminster government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jul/03/uk-government-to-foot-police-bill-for-trump-golfing-trip-to-scotland\" title=\"\">will pick up the bill</a> for the security around his trip north of the border. Among Theresa May\u2019s advisers, \u00a35m is thought to be a price well worth paying. Hitting small white balls into holes keeps her volatile visitor distracted and off Twitter. As importantly, the trip north of the Cheviots will reduce the amount of time that he is in London, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jul/05/donald-trump-to-be-met-by-protests-at-each-stage-of-uk-visit\" title=\"\">protests against his presence</a> in Britain are likely to be the largest.</p> <p>Previous visits by American presidents have emphasised the historic bonds between the two countries and underlined a continuing closeness of values and interests. This much-delayed visit will stress the many strains in the relationship. There will be no carriage ride down the mall with the Queen or banquet at Buckingham Palace. He will be helicoptered between&#xa0;country residences and well-guarded stately homes. Rather than put the visitor near the British public, huge effort has gone into keeping him as far away from them as possible.</p> <p>The security aspects of the visit have been giving nightmares to those in charge of it, but they are not the most anxiety-inducing dimension for Mrs May. Her largest concern is the political handling of her guest. This is a subject of such worry at the top of government that the cabinet recently even took a bit of time out from wrangling over Brexit to debate what to do. They did not come to any particularly useful conclusions other than that Mrs May will have to muddle through and pray that it is not a disaster.</p> <p>The prime minister wants to minimise her public exposure to an American leader so unpopular with her own voters. At the same time she does not want to provoke her thin-skinned and mercurial guest.</p> <p>The biggest risk to Mrs May is that she gets crushed in a hideous diplomatic crunch. The president\u2019s visit to Britain will be preceded by a Nato summit in Brussels. The western alliance is brittle; relations between the US and its traditional allies in Europe have not been in such bad shape since the foundation of the mutual defence pact. If the summit explodes into rancorous quarrelling about the funding and future of Nato, Mrs May will be left stranded in the middle of the wreckage.</p> <p>After his visit to Britain, Donald Trump flies to Helsinki to meet Vladimir Putin. It is not beyond the bounds of possibility \u2013 it is wise not to rule out anything with this president \u2013 that he could strike some kind of bargain with the autocrat of the Kremlin that undermines Europe\u2019s security. How do you say cheers in Russian? A Trump-Putin love-in would make Mrs May look awful when two British citizens have just become the victims of the novichok bio-weapon.</p> <p>Even the most skilful of people handlers would have a hard time managing this American president. And Mrs May is not a brilliant people handler. Her personal chemistry with him is poor. She looked like a supplicant desperate for his goodwill when she made her dash to the White House early in his presidency and got nothing to show for it beyond some toe-curling pictures of the two of them awkwardly holding hands. The only relief for British officials was that he did not grab a different part of the prime minister\u2019s anatomy. At last month\u2019s G7 summit in Quebec, he omitted Mrs May from a list of other leaders whom he claimed to have good relations with. Whether this was a deliberate slight or just negligence, who can say? He is capable of both.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is one of the many alarming things about Trump that he rarely meets an autocrat that he does not take to</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There is one consolation for fretful British officials: none of the other traditional allies of America have found a way to conduct a fruitful relationship with this president. Justin Trudeau of Canada was the target of Trumpian vilification as a \u201cbackstabber\u201d when that G7 collapsed into acrimony. Angela Merkel\u2019s coolly diplomatic suggestions that America should remain true to democratic values have earned her the naked contempt of the occupant of the Oval Office. There was a period when Emmanuel Macron appeared to be establishing a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/14/macron-pulls-out-all-stops-bastille-day-parade-trump-france\" title=\"\">strange kind of bromance</a> after he invited the American president to join last year\u2019s Bastille Day parade. His guest loved the display of flags and military hardware so much that he went home demanding one of his own. British officials, always neurotic about their country\u2019s status in Washington, became twitchy when the French president boasted of \u201ca very special relationship\u201d with America. The British over-worried. True, Mr Macron got a return trip to Washington and an opportunity to address the joint houses of Congress. Yet, when it comes to substance, it is hard to see what the French president has actually achieved. His pleas for policy shifts by Washington have been unrequited. He tried to persuade the American to rework the nuclear deal with Iran; Mr Trump just tore it up regardless, as he also shredded America\u2019s commitment to the Paris agreement on climate change.</p> <p>No one has worked harder to woo him than Shinzo Abe, the prime minister of Japan and the first world leader to pay court at Trump Tower. His many efforts to flatter this president have not won him sufficient respect to get advance warning of Trumpian gambits towards North Korea, despite Japan\u2019s keen concern about what happens with the nuclear weapons state just over the sea. Much of Japan\u2019s prosperity hangs on the prowess of its export industries. The escalating trade war triggered from the Oval Office is very much not in its interests. Mrs May ought to note that fawning to Donald Trump does not work.

          "bodyText": "This week will feature a record-breaker: the most expensive game of amateur golf in British, and probably world, history. A \u00a35m price tag is being put on the Scottish leg of Donald Trump\u2019s visit to these shores. The Edinburgh government has been told that the Westminster government will pick up the bill for the security around his trip north of the border. Among Theresa May\u2019s advisers, \u00a35m is thought to be a price well worth paying. Hitting small white balls into holes keeps her volatile visitor distracted and off Twitter. As importantly, the trip north of the Cheviots will reduce the amount of time that he is in London, where protests against his presence in Britain are likely to be the largest. Previous visits by American presidents have emphasised the historic bonds between the two countries and underlined a continuing closeness of values and interests. This much-delayed visit will stress the many strains in the relationship. There will be no carriage ride down the mall with the Queen or banquet at Buckingham Palace. He will be helicoptered between country residences and well-guarded stately homes. Rather than put the visitor near the British public, huge effort has gone into keeping him as far away from them as possible. The security aspects of the visit have been giving nightmares to those in charge of it, but they are not the most anxiety-inducing dimension for Mrs May. Her largest concern is the political handling of her guest. This is a subject of such worry at the top of government that the cabinet recently even took a bit of time out from wrangling over Brexit to debate what to do. They did not come to any particularly useful conclusions other than that Mrs May will have to muddle through and pray that it is not a disaster. The prime minister wants to minimise her public exposure to an American leader so unpopular with her own voters. At the same time she does not want to provoke her thin-skinned and mercurial guest. The biggest risk to Mrs May is that she gets crushed in a hideous diplomatic crunch. The president\u2019s visit to Britain will be preceded by a Nato summit in Brussels. The western alliance is brittle; relations between the US and its traditional allies in Europe have not been in such bad shape since the foundation of the mutual defence pact. If the summit explodes into rancorous quarrelling about the funding and future of Nato, Mrs May will be left stranded in the middle of the wreckage. After his visit to Britain, Donald Trump flies to Helsinki to meet Vladimir Putin. It is not beyond the bounds of possibility \u2013 it is wise not to rule out anything with this president \u2013 that he could strike some kind of bargain with the autocrat of the Kremlin that undermines Europe\u2019s security. How do you say cheers in Russian? A Trump-Putin love-in would make Mrs May look awful when two British citizens have just become the victims of the novichok bio-weapon. Even the most skilful of people handlers would have a hard time managing this American president. And Mrs May is not a brilliant people handler. Her personal chemistry with him is poor. She looked like a supplicant desperate for his goodwill when she made her dash to the White House early in his presidency and got nothing to show for it beyond some toe-curling pictures of the two of them awkwardly holding hands. The only relief for British officials was that he did not grab a different part of the prime minister\u2019s anatomy. At last month\u2019s G7 summit in Quebec, he omitted Mrs May from a list of other leaders whom he claimed to have good relations with. Whether this was a deliberate slight or just negligence, who can say? He is capable of both. There is one consolation for fretful British officials: none of the other traditional allies of America have found a way to conduct a fruitful relationship with this president. Justin Trudeau of Canada was the target of Trumpian vilification as a \u201cbackstabber\u201d when that G7 collapsed into acrimony. Angela Merkel\u2019s coolly diplomatic suggestions that America should remain true to democratic values have earned her the naked contempt of the occupant of the Oval Office. There was a period when Emmanuel Macron appeared to be establishing a strange kind of bromance after he invited the American president to join last year\u2019s Bastille Day parade. His guest loved the display of flags and military hardware so much that he went home demanding one of his own. British officials, always neurotic about their country\u2019s status in Washington, became twitchy when the French president boasted of \u201ca very special relationship\u201d with America. The British over-worried. True, Mr Macron got a return trip to Washington and an opportunity to address the joint houses of Congress. Yet, when it comes to substance, it is hard to see what the French president has actually achieved. His pleas for policy shifts by Washington have been unrequited. He tried to persuade the American to rework the nuclear deal with Iran; Mr Trump just tore it up regardless, as he also shredded America\u2019s commitment to the Paris agreement on climate change. No one has worked harder to woo him than Shinzo Abe, the prime minister of Japan and the first world leader to pay court at Trump Tower. His many efforts to flatter this president have not won him sufficient respect to get advance warning of Trumpian gambits towards North Korea, despite Japan\u2019s keen concern about what happens with the nuclear weapons state just over the sea. Much of Japan\u2019s prosperity hangs on the prowess of its export industries. The escalating trade war triggered from the Oval Office is very much not in its interests. Mrs May ought to note that fawning to Donald Trump does not work. He reads it as weakness. His behavioural patterns suggest that one way to establish a relationship with this president is not to be one of the US\u2019s traditional friends, but to be one of America\u2019s historic adversaries. Vladimir Putin has often been lavished with Trumpian expressions of admiration. It is one of the many alarming things about him that he rarely meets an autocrat that he does not take to. This includes Kim Jong-un, \u201ca very talented man\u201d with whom he\u2019d forged a \u201cvery special bond\u201d, gushed the American after his summit with North Korea\u2019s brutal dictator. Perhaps Mrs May\u2019s best bet \u2013 I make this suggestion only half in jest \u2013 would be to remind the American president that the British burnt down the White House in 1814. Maybe that would get his respect. Britain\u2019s primary objective is to prevent the disintegration of Nato, the cornerstone of our security since the 1940s.

The tit-for-tat tariffs took effect weeks after the US president lashed out online at Justin Trudeau, calling the Canadian prime minister \u201cmeek and mild\u201d on Twitter and accusing him of being dishonest. The maritime boat checks risk now joining the list of irritants between the countries, after Ottawa said it was investigating the reports. \u201cCanada\u2019s sovereignty over the Machias Seal Island and the surrounding waters is longstanding and has a strong foundation in international law,\u201d said a spokesperson for Global Affairs Canada. The statement also noted the \u201clong history of cooperation\u201d between Canada and US in the area. In a statement to the Guardian, US Customs and Border Protection confirmed that agents had \u201cinterviewed\u201d 21 Canadian vessels so far this year. They declined to specify how many of these were fishing vessels. The agency was conducting patrols to enforce immigration laws and other potential violations of federal law, the statement said, adding that among the Canadian vessels that were stopped, no immigration arrests were made. The statement noted that agents based in Maine have \u201cconducted operations in the past in this area and will continue to conduct operations in the waters off the coast of Maine in jurisdictional waters of the United States\u201d. Given the area, any focus on immigration would be surprising, said Stephen Kelly, a research scholar at Duke University and former American diplomat who served in Canada. \u201cBecause it\u2019s not exactly what you would call a major people smuggling route, as far as I\u2019m aware.\u201d He speculated that the agency might have obtained intelligence on people being moved through the area or on other federal crimes such as drug smuggling. He pointed to the ongoing territorial dispute to explain why the issue had made headlines, with initial media reports suggesting that US law enforcement had intercepted Canadian vessels in Canadian waters. \u201cI\u2019m sure from the border patrol\u2019s perspective, that\u2019s not at all what they were doing,\u201d he said, citing the American claim on the area that dates back to the late 1700s. Kelly has long argued that the two countries should come together to resolve the dispute, rather than allowing it to fester and flare up now and again. \u201cI don\u2019t think its going to lead to blows between the US and Canada, although the current environment is not as rosy as it has been in the past,\u201d he said. \u201cBut why let an issue like this hang out there and provide a burr under the saddle?\u201d",

However, the new Conservative premier\u2019s background and public behaviour is quite Trumpish, including Ford\u2019s record of publicly belittling gay pride activists and the developmentally handicapped.</p> <p>Lee also credits Ford\u2019s victory to the province\u2019s rejection of defeated Liberal premier Kathleen Wynne, \u201cwho had steered the province to the left\u201d. Such simplistic analysis imagines sharp ideological borders that encourage exclusion rather than compromise. Lee\u2019s quoted remarks may well reflect his quantitative perspective rather than the messy complexity of reality.<br><strong>Morgan Duchesney</strong><br>Ottawa, Ontario, Canada</p> <h2><strong>An asteroid problem to crack</strong></h2> <p>There\u2019s a problem with your article on asteroid mining (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/06/asteroid-mining-space-minerals-legal-issues\" title=\"\">There\u2019s gold in them thar asteroids, 22 June</a>).

          "bodyText": "Ford\u2019s Trumpish tendencies According to Ian Lee, a professor at Carleton University, Doug Ford\u2019s political victory in Ontario (15 June) is unrelated to rightwing populist trends in the US and Europe. However, the new Conservative premier\u2019s background and public behaviour is quite Trumpish, including Ford\u2019s record of publicly belittling gay pride activists and the developmentally handicapped. Lee also credits Ford\u2019s victory to the province\u2019s rejection of defeated Liberal premier Kathleen Wynne, \u201cwho had steered the province to the left\u201d. Such simplistic analysis imagines sharp ideological borders that encourage exclusion rather than compromise. Lee\u2019s quoted remarks may well reflect his quantitative perspective rather than the messy complexity of reality. Morgan Duchesney Ottawa, Ontario, Canada An asteroid problem to crack There\u2019s a problem with your article on asteroid mining (There\u2019s gold in them thar asteroids, 22 June). It talks of small spaceships that could be \u201cpropelled using super-hot water vapour heated to 1,000C\u201d, and that would be able to \u201crefuel in space either directly with water [from the asteroids] or the hydrogen and oxygen that can be created from it.\u201d You need two things to get a vessel moving in the vacuum of space: some mass to throw out the back end and a source of energy to get that mass moving. In a conventional rocket the fuel fulfils both functions. The water from the asteroid could provide the mass, but not the energy. Sure, recombining its oxygen and hydrogen could produce energy, but you need energy to break the water down to oxygen and hydrogen in the first place. So, absent such an external energy source, of which the article makes no mention, instead of being able to \u201czip around merrily with no end to their useful life\u201d these spaceships would be stuck on their asteroids for all eternity. Stuart Corner Enmore, NSW, Australia Abortion and women\u2019s rights I can support an argument for liberalising Ireland\u2019s abortion law (1 June) as a legal compromise aimed at protecting women from unsafe backstreet abortions. But I find incomprehensible a claim that this is a \u201cvictory for women\u2019s rights\u201d. Anyone with a knowledge of human biology knows that every cell in the foetus is genetically different from the rest of the mother\u2019s body. This is a vulnerable human being at an early stage of development and needs the protection of the law. This is what makes abortion a difficult legal dilemma, one that is side-stepped by so-called radical feminist rhetoric.

The US database was managed through the state department and was primarily concerned with consular information; the original Tuscan and Tactics agreements were merely ways to export that list to Canadian and Australian counterparts.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/04/canada-six-year-old-no-fly-list-syed-adam-ahmed\">Father of Canadian six-year-old on no-fly list: our family is not alone</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Following 9/11, the US government began to consolidate its immigration and national security databases. As the final report of the 9/11 Commission noted, Tuscan was part of a program \u201cwhich included a number of databases containing such derogatory information on individuals as prior visa refusals and federal arrest warrants\u201d. Even then it was not, itself, grounds to arrest someone or deny their immigration or visa application.</p> <p>That soon changed with the creation of the Terrorist Screening Centre, housed within the FBI, which moved the data to a new Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (Tide) \u2013 which is now the the master list for the US government and its intelligence agencies.</p> <p>Tide comprises more than a million names. The records are reviewed and, if approved, added to the Terrorist Screening Centre database, which in turn populates a variety of other lists, including the US no-fly list; the \u201cselectee list\u201d, which includes those who do not meet the threshold for the no-fly list; Tactics and Tuscan.</p> <p>The memos obtained by the Guardian detail how border guards and immigration officials \u201cutilize Tuscan information\u201d to vet travellers, in Canada and abroad, and \u201cto intercept and potentially apprehend or refuse entry to known or suspected terrorists\u201d.</p> <p>Should a Canadian border guard get a hit, the Tuscan policy instructs them to delay the traveller until they can obtain more information from the screening centre. From there, the FBI can send on their passport details, citizenship and a unique identifying number in order to confirm their identity. Once their identity is confirmed, the FBI can provide \u201cderogatory indicators\u201d, which Canada can use to search and question the traveller.</p> <h2>From Obama to Trump</h2> <p>Tuscan became a priority for Trudeau after being elected prime minister in 2015, when he quickly set off to improve relations with Canada\u2019s closest ally on a visit to Washington. There, he and Barack Obama extolled the virtues of improved border information-sharing.<br></p> <p>Obama told reporters at a joint press conference in the Rose Garden in March of 2016: \u201cToday, we agreed to share more information \u2013 including with respect to our no-fly lists and full implementation of our entry/exit system \u2013 even as we uphold the privacy and civil liberties of our respective citizens.\u201d</p> <p>The project \u2013 later dubbed the \u201cBeyond the Border Action Plan\u201d \u2013 committed both countries to \u201cshare information and intelligence in support of law enforcement and national security, respecting each country\u2019s respective constitutional and legal frameworks\u201d.</p> <p>Publicly, the Trudeau government said it would share entry and exit data for US citizens with the Americans: basic information on who crossed which border and when. Canada would also share its no-fly list with the US.</p> <p>Neither government mentioned Tuscan, but soon afterwards, Goodale authorized officials to begin formal negotiations with their American counterparts to update and expand it.</p> <p>The negotiations sought to vastly increase the information flow both ways. The FBI\u2019s Terrorist Screening Center and the Canadian Border Service Agency (CBSA) would share more data on individuals, including details of interviews or searches conducted at the border. It would also empower the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, Canada\u2019s main spy agency, and Immigration Canada to pass on information to the TSC when there is a match on Tuscan.<br></p> <p>The election of Donald Trump caught Canada\u2019s security officials by surprise, and Trump\u2019s executive order barring travellers from several Muslim-majority countries threw Ottawa into crisis mode. For days, it was unclear if the ban would apply to Canadian citizens or green card holders, sowing confusion at the airports and borders.<br></p> <p>Nevertheless, Ottawa pushed ahead with its plans to update Tuscan under the Trump administration, with one June 2017 memo reporting that the \u201cimplementation of changes would take place into fall 2017\u201d. A government spokesperson says both governments are continuing to \u201crefine details\u201d before the new program comes online.</p> <p>Paterson of the BC Civil Liberties Association says the deal smacks of hypocrisy. He notes that Goodale has embarked on a public consultation on national security, promising transparency and a review of the official no-fly list \u2013 even while staying silent about Tuscan, which has been functioning all along as a second, unofficial no-fly list. </p> <p>\u201cIt feels very much like the conversations we\u2019ve been having with the government have been for show,\u201d he says. \u201cA distraction.\u201d</p>",

Derogatory indicators Despite the concerns, Trudeau has been working since 2016 to expand Tuscan behind closed doors, a process that has continued with the Trump administration. When the Tuscan agreement was first signed, in 1997, it was a very different program than it is now. The US database was managed through the state department and was primarily concerned with consular information; the original Tuscan and Tactics agreements were merely ways to export that list to Canadian and Australian counterparts. Following 9/11, the US government began to consolidate its immigration and national security databases. As the final report of the 9/11 Commission noted, Tuscan was part of a program \u201cwhich included a number of databases containing such derogatory information on individuals as prior visa refusals and federal arrest warrants\u201d. Even then it was not, itself, grounds to arrest someone or deny their immigration or visa application. That soon changed with the creation of the Terrorist Screening Centre, housed within the FBI, which moved the data to a new Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (Tide) \u2013 which is now the the master list for the US government and its intelligence agencies. Tide comprises more than a million names. The records are reviewed and, if approved, added to the Terrorist Screening Centre database, which in turn populates a variety of other lists, including the US no-fly list; the \u201cselectee list\u201d, which includes those who do not meet the threshold for the no-fly list; Tactics and Tuscan. The memos obtained by the Guardian detail how border guards and immigration officials \u201cutilize Tuscan information\u201d to vet travellers, in Canada and abroad, and \u201cto intercept and potentially apprehend or refuse entry to known or suspected terrorists\u201d. Should a Canadian border guard get a hit, the Tuscan policy instructs them to delay the traveller until they can obtain more information from the screening centre. From there, the FBI can send on their passport details, citizenship and a unique identifying number in order to confirm their identity. Once their identity is confirmed, the FBI can provide \u201cderogatory indicators\u201d, which Canada can use to search and question the traveller. From Obama to Trump Tuscan became a priority for Trudeau after being elected prime minister in 2015, when he quickly set off to improve relations with Canada\u2019s closest ally on a visit to Washington. There, he and Barack Obama extolled the virtues of improved border information-sharing. Obama told reporters at a joint press conference in the Rose Garden in March of 2016: \u201cToday, we agreed to share more information \u2013 including with respect to our no-fly lists and full implementation of our entry/exit system \u2013 even as we uphold the privacy and civil liberties of our respective citizens.\u201d The project \u2013 later dubbed the \u201cBeyond the Border Action Plan\u201d \u2013 committed both countries to \u201cshare information and intelligence in support of law enforcement and national security, respecting each country\u2019s respective constitutional and legal frameworks\u201d. Publicly, the Trudeau government said it would share entry and exit data for US citizens with the Americans: basic information on who crossed which border and when. Canada would also share its no-fly list with the US. Neither government mentioned Tuscan, but soon afterwards, Goodale authorized officials to begin formal negotiations with their American counterparts to update and expand it. The negotiations sought to vastly increase the information flow both ways. The FBI\u2019s Terrorist Screening Center and the Canadian Border Service Agency (CBSA) would share more data on individuals, including details of interviews or searches conducted at the border. It would also empower the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, Canada\u2019s main spy agency, and Immigration Canada to pass on information to the TSC when there is a match on Tuscan. The election of Donald Trump caught Canada\u2019s security officials by surprise, and Trump\u2019s executive order barring travellers from several Muslim-majority countries threw Ottawa into crisis mode. For days, it was unclear if the ban would apply to Canadian citizens or green card holders, sowing confusion at the airports and borders. Nevertheless, Ottawa pushed ahead with its plans to update Tuscan under the Trump administration, with one June 2017 memo reporting that the \u201cimplementation of changes would take place into fall 2017\u201d. A government spokesperson says both governments are continuing to \u201crefine details\u201d before the new program comes online. Paterson of the BC Civil Liberties Association says the deal smacks of hypocrisy. He notes that Goodale has embarked on a public consultation on national security, promising transparency and a review of the official no-fly list \u2013 even while staying silent about Tuscan, which has been functioning all along as a second, unofficial no-fly list. \u201cIt feels very much like the conversations we\u2019ve been having with the government have been for show,\u201d he says. \u201cA distraction.\u201d",

The two schools face off every year in a grudge croquet match.</p> \n   <p>The shooting on Thursday happened just outside of city limits; it was in a nondescript suburban office building where the Capital Gazette shared space with dentists and lawyers and across the street from an upscale shopping mall filled with department stores and nicer sort of chain restaurants.</p> \n   <p>But the shooting changed all of that. It added what its mayor called \u201ca Mayberry kind of town\u201d to the long roll call of American cities that have seen mass shootings. It joins places like Littleton, Colorado, Newtown, Connecticut and Parkland, Florida on a sad ever-growing list.</p> \n   <p>But Annapolis has faced worse. Its early years were marked by the religious conflict of the English Civil War. It has faced the turmoil of the American Revolution where a British ship carrying tea was burned in the harbor less than a year after the Boston Tea Party.

In the global context, an attack on local journalists for covering a small local issue is far from unprecedented, Simon said. </p> \n  <p>Many of the attacks that CPJ tracks targeted local journalists who \u201creported on very local issues and got killed as a result,\u201d including for issues that might seem \u201cfairly petty,\u201d like coverage of cockfighting or an expose of a local politician, Simon said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cJournalists who work in a very local context, they have an intimate relationship with the communities they cover. When powerful figures in their communities are upset with them, they know precisely who the journalists are,\u201d Simon said. \u201cThe anger they feel, in their own minds, about being exposed within their own communities can be a powerful force that leads them into this violence.\u201d </p> \n  <p>\u201cNot all of these crimes are carried out because of some national conflict or some high-profile corruption scandal or human rights issues. A lot of them are responsive to journalists working in their own communities, exposing corruption or wrongdoing of powerful figures within those communities.\u201d</p> \n  <p>According to Committee to Protect Journalists statistics the deadliest day for journalists globally was November 23, 2009, in the Phillipines, when \u201c29 journalists and two media support workers were ambushed and brutally slain\u201d in a \u201cpolitically motivated ambush,\u201d according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.</p> \n  <p>The 2015 attack on Charlie Hebdo, a satirical French magazine, which left 12 people dead, is the \u201cmost comparable event\u201d to Thursday\u2019s shooting, Simon said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cMultiple killings of journalists in a global context are not uncommon,\u201d Simon said, but \u201cBut this is an unprecedented event in the United States.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>With many details about the attack still unknown, Simon cautioned against linking Thursday\u2019s shooting to President Donald Trump\u2019s continued rhetorical attacks on journalists as \u201cthe enemy of the people.\u201d <br><br>\u201cObviously, we\u2019ve expressed our dismay at these comments that President Trump has made, and we\u2019re obviously horrified by what happened today. At this point, knowning what we know, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wise to make any connection,\u201d Simon, the executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, said.<br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-06-29T03:46:05.814Z\">at 4.46am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5b35a1e1e4b03b042370d50f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-29T03:11:44.608Z\">4.11am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Additional police patrols were deployed to the offices of news outlets around the US this afternoon, in response to today\u2019s attack on the Capital Gazette newspaper in Annapolis, Maryland. </p> \n  <p>The Los Angeles Police Department announced they were adding patrols around major news outlets in the city as a precaution and \u201creassurance\u201d.

Here\u2019s what we know so far: Five people have been shot dead in a \u201ctargeted attack\u201d on the Capital Gazette newspaper in Annapolis, Maryland. The suspect has not been named by police, but multiple news outlets have identified him as Jarrod Ramos, a 38-year-old man who had previously sued the newspaper for defamation in 2012. He is in custody and policy are investigating his home. They will provide an update tomorrow. The five victims have been identified and tributes have come in from friends and colleagues. The Capital Gazette is \u201cputting out a damn paper tomorrow\u201d. Thanks for following. The fundraiser to help the Capital Gazette newsroom and staff has hit $50,000, in 8 hours. Started by Bloomberg reporter Madi Alexander, the money will go towards medical bills, funeral costs, repairs, and any other unforeseen costs of today\u2019s shooting. Here\u2019s how the victims of today\u2019s shooting have been remembered by their friends and colleagues: Veteran 59-year-old editor Rob Hiassen was a \u201cgenerous mentor\u201d who always helped reporters make their work \u201cmore human\u201d. Gerald Fischman, the 61-year-old page editor, had worked at the paper for over 25 years. He was the paper\u2019s \u201cconscience\u201d with a \u201cwicked pen\u201d Wendi Winters, 65, started as a freelancer before becoming an editor, spending 12 years \u201cwriting her way into the newsroom\u201d. John McNamara, a 55-year-old staff writer, was versatile, a jack of all trades, and a \u201cfantastic person\u201d. Rebecca Smith, 34, a sales assistant and the youngest employee killed, was remembered as \u201cthoughtful and considerate\u201d and always ready to help. Read Lois Beckett\u2019s full report: Ben Jacobs, on the ground in Maryland, has this profile of Annapolis \u2013 the latest \u201cnice town\u201d on the list of \u201cnice towns\u201d to have suffered a mass shooting. Annapolis is a nice town. The quaint red brick city on the shores of the Severn is a genteel place three and a half centuries old. It\u2019s the type of town where sailing and lacrosse are sports as big as baseball and football and where antique shops and B&amp;Bs are major economic engines. It\u2019s not just a college town but home to two diametrically opposed educational institutions, the United States Naval Academy and St. John\u2019s College. The two schools face off every year in a grudge croquet match. The shooting on Thursday happened just outside of city limits; it was in a nondescript suburban office building where the Capital Gazette shared space with dentists and lawyers and across the street from an upscale shopping mall filled with department stores and nicer sort of chain restaurants. But the shooting changed all of that. It added what its mayor called \u201ca Mayberry kind of town\u201d to the long roll call of American cities that have seen mass shootings. It joins places like Littleton, Colorado, Newtown, Connecticut and Parkland, Florida on a sad ever-growing list. But Annapolis has faced worse. Its early years were marked by the religious conflict of the English Civil War. It has faced the turmoil of the American Revolution where a British ship carrying tea was burned in the harbor less than a year after the Boston Tea Party. And it seems capable of rallying together even after the unimaginable horror of Thursday. After all, it is a nice town. The mayor of Annapolis, Gavin Buckley, has said he cannot understand how the reporters of the Capital Gazette \u201ccould make someone that hostile\u201d. \u201cIf this is an attack on journalism it is a sad state of affairs,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not in some war zone, we\u2019re not in some third-world country with a dictator. We are in a Mayberry kind of town, we\u2019re in shock we\u2019re going to be grappling with.\u201d Read the full interview below: Tributes are flowing in for that front page, and for the 10 reporters and photographers who have put together the report on their own newsroom. The reporters on that byline are: Chase Cook, Phil Davies, Selene San Felice, E.B. Ferguson III, Rachael Pacella, Danielle Ohl, Joshua McKerror, Paul W. Gillespie, David Broughton and Bob Hough. Here\u2019s the front page of tomorrow\u2019s Capital Gazette: In the words of the newspaper\u2019s editors: \u201cWe\u2019re putting out a damn paper tomorrow.\u201d Two Capital Gazette staffers have been released from hospital, according to an internal memo being reported by CNN. They were taken to hospital with \u201cnon life-threatening injuries\u201d. Earlier, acting police chief William Krampf said the injuries were possibly caused by shattered glass from the shotgun blast. There have been some updates to our piece tying together what we know so far about the shooting. The latest: Police said the shooter \u201cindicated violence\u201d through social media threats before the shooting. The suspect did not exchange gunfire with responding officers The suspect used smoke grenades \u2013 initially reported as improvised explosive decvices \u2013 when carrying out the attack. Read the full article here: \u201cThe attack on the Capital Gazette, in which four journalists and a sales assistant were murdered, is the most deadly day for the media that we have recorded in the United States since we began tracking data in 1992,\u201d said Joel Simon, the executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, which collects data on journalists killed in work-related incidents worldwide. News reports Thursday night naming the suspected shooter identified him as a man who had previously sued the newspaper for defamation and lost. In the global context, an attack on local journalists for covering a small local issue is far from unprecedented, Simon said. Many of the attacks that CPJ tracks targeted local journalists who \u201creported on very local issues and got killed as a result,\u201d including for issues that might seem \u201cfairly petty,\u201d like coverage of cockfighting or an expose of a local politician, Simon said. \u201cJournalists who work in a very local context, they have an intimate relationship with the communities they cover. When powerful figures in their communities are upset with them, they know precisely who the journalists are,\u201d Simon said. \u201cThe anger they feel, in their own minds, about being exposed within their own communities can be a powerful force that leads them into this violence.\u201d \u201cNot all of these crimes are carried out because of some national conflict or some high-profile corruption scandal or human rights issues. A lot of them are responsive to journalists working in their own communities, exposing corruption or wrongdoing of powerful figures within those communities.\u201d According to Committee to Protect Journalists statistics the deadliest day for journalists globally was November 23, 2009, in the Phillipines, when \u201c29 journalists and two media support workers were ambushed and brutally slain\u201d in a \u201cpolitically motivated ambush,\u201d according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. The 2015 attack on Charlie Hebdo, a satirical French magazine, which left 12 people dead, is the \u201cmost comparable event\u201d to Thursday\u2019s shooting, Simon said. \u201cMultiple killings of journalists in a global context are not uncommon,\u201d Simon said, but \u201cBut this is an unprecedented event in the United States.\u201d With many details about the attack still unknown, Simon cautioned against linking Thursday\u2019s shooting to President Donald Trump\u2019s continued rhetorical attacks on journalists as \u201cthe enemy of the people.\u201d \u201cObviously, we\u2019ve expressed our dismay at these comments that President Trump has made, and we\u2019re obviously horrified by what happened today. At this point, knowning what we know, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wise to make any connection,\u201d Simon, the executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, said. Additional police patrols were deployed to the offices of news outlets around the US this afternoon, in response to today\u2019s attack on the Capital Gazette newspaper in Annapolis, Maryland. The Los Angeles Police Department announced they were adding patrols around major news outlets in the city as a precaution and \u201creassurance\u201d. The New York Times and Reuters buildings also had police stationed outside through the afternoon. Anne Arundel police department has released a statement saying that for \u201cinvestigative reasons\u201d they have not released the suspect\u2019s name or photograph. The suspect has been widely named by various newspapers, citing police sources and police documents, as Jarrod Ramos, 38, of Laurel, Maryland, though the Guardian has not confirmed this independently. Posts have been pouring in on social about the five victims who were named by police in the last half hour. Former and current journalists from the Capital Gazette have tweeted about their colleagues: Justin Trudeau has tweeted in response to the shooting, saying an attack on journalists trying to do their jobs was \u201cdevastating\u201d. The Baltimore Sun, the sister newspaper of the Capital Gazette, have released an editorial paying tribute to their colleagues and speaking of the need to act in response to the \u201cshocking regularity\u201d of mass shootings. As journalists, we have covered more mass shootings than we care to count. Today gun violence hit our family, and we are feeling its pain more acutely than we could have imagined \u2014 yet it\u2019s a pain we know will be repeated in community after community, in shooting after shooting, unless we act. We can accept no more excuses. They also pointed to the atmosphere of hostility toward journalism at present in the US. At a time of political divisiveness when views of the news industry itself have become starkly polarised, many jumped quickly to speculation about whether the metaphorical war on the media had become shockingly literal... That\u2019s why so many reporters across the nation got a sickening feeling Thursday afternoon \u2014 they couldn\u2019t believe something like this had happened, except that they could. Gavin Buckley, mayor of Annapolis, who spoke to CNN immediately before the press conference held by police, praised the county\u2019s police officers who ran toward danger. Earlier today Lt Ryan Frashure, of the Anne Arundel county police, told press that police were on the scene \u201cless than a minute\u201d after the attack began. Mayor Buckley said their swift response can be credited to recent training. \u201cLast month we did an active shooter drill and that is why our guys got there so fast,\u201d said Buckley. Buckley said he was at a loss to know why the newspaper would have been targeted, and that it was not a politically contentious publication. \u201cThis paper is not a liberal newspaper, it\u2019s not a right wing newspaper, it stays in the middle and covers local issues,\u201d he said. Adding, of the reporters, \u201cwe love them\u201d. I have to ask the question: why are people so tightly wound now? What is making people so angry?\u201d The victims of the attack have been named, all of them were employees of the Gazette. They are: Rob Hiaasen, assistant news editor, Gerald Fischman, editorial page editor, Wendi Winters, special publications editor, Rebecca Smith, sales assistant, and John McNamara, staff writer. Acting police chief William Krampf has concluded the press conference: We have a responsibility and an obligation to these victims, everyone in the Anne Arundel county police, we are deeply saddened by what happened today, we are deeply saddened that we had to make those notifications, we are deeply saddened that a person had to take this into his own hands and this is the result. Acting police chief Krampf is addressing media and naming victims. He says the suspect is being interrogated and there are \u201cno further threats\u201d connected with the attack. \u201cThis cannot be the new normal,\u201d Gavin Buckley, the mayor of Annapolis has said. Addressing CNN he said he had to ask the question \u201cWhy are people so tightly wound now? What is making people so angry?\u201d More on that shortly, but the police are about to address media. This is Kate Lyons, taking over from Julia Carrie Wong. Staff at the Capital Gazette newspaper in Annapolis, Maryland, who were in the newspaper\u2019s offices when a gunman entered and killed five of their colleagues, have said they need more than \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d from the president. President Trump tweeted that he had been briefed on the shooting and his \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d were with the victims and their families, but refused to answer reporters questions about the shooting or issue an on-camera statement about it. \u201cI have heard that President Trump sends his prayers,\u201d said staff writer Selene San Felice. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to make this political, but we need more than prayers. I want your prayers, but I want something else.\u201d \u201cThis is going to be a story for how many days? Less than a week? People will forget about us in less than a week,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cI\u2019m going to need more than a couple of days of news coverage and thoughts and prayers, our whole lives have been shattered.\u201d San Felice told of how she and a colleague had hidden under a desk when the gunman entered the building and had herself been praying while the shooting had been going on, but suggested she wanted more in response to the violence. \u201cThank you for your prayers, but I couldn\u2019t give a fuck about them if there\u2019s nothing else.\u201d Phil Davis, another staff writer at the newspaper, told CNN: \u201cI was praying when he started reloading that shotgun that there weren\u2019t going to be more bodies, but if we\u2019re in a position in this society where all we can offer is prayers, where are we as a society?\u201d The suspect in today\u2019s attack has been named by various news outlets as Jarrod W. Ramos, 38, from Laurel, Maryland. Ramos has been named by the Washington Post citing police sources, and was earlier named by the Baltimore Sun, the sister newspaper of the Capital Gazette, where the attack took place. The Washington Post wrote that a bulletin emailed to Maryland law enforcement officials identified the shooting suspect as Jarrod Ramos and police were searching an apartment in Laurel tied to Ramos. The Guardian has not been able to independently verify his identity and police said earlier today they would not be releasing the name of the suspect, who is in custody, until tomorrow morning. Ramos filed a defamation case against the Capital Gazette in 2012 for a column written about him by columnist Eric Hartley, which he lost in 2015. Columnist and assistant editor Rob Hiaasen has been named by the Baltimore Sun as one of the five people killed in a shooting at the Sun\u2019s sister publication, the Capital Gazette. The veteran newspaper reporter had been a features writer for the Baltimore Sun for 17 years before he joined the Capital in 2010. In addition to his editing duties, he wrote a Sunday column on topics ranging from bat houses to snow snorkeling. On Tuesday night, Capital photojournalist Paul W Gillespie tweeted praise for the editor, who had ordered pizza to sustain the newsroom on an election night. Hiaasen\u2019s brother, Carl Hiaasen, is a well known author and journalist. \u201cI just want people to know what an incredibly gentle, generous and gifted guy my brother was,\u201d Carl Hiaasen told the Washington Post Thursday night. \u201cHe was an unforgettably warm and uplifting presence as a father and brother, but he also had dedicated his whole life to journalism.\u201d Lieutenant Ryan Frashure of the Anne Arundel county police just told CNN that reports about the suspect\u2019s fingerprints having been mutilated are false. \u201cIt is simply not true that he obliterated his fingerprints,\u201d Frashure told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper. At this evening\u2019s press conference, acting police chief Krampf had said only that he did not know about the reports that the suspect had attempted to hide his identity my mutilating his fingers. But when Cooper asked for clarification, Frashure repeated: \u201cHe definitely didn\u2019t obliterate them.\u201d Ben Jacobs is on the ground in Annapolis, where he just attended a press briefing by acting police chief and spoke briefly to one of the Capital Gazette\u2019s reporters. Pat Furgurson, a veteran journalist for the Capital Gazette stood behind the police during the press conference, in an untucked blue shirt and rumpled khakis, recording audio and even getting in a question. Afterwards, Furgurson spoke briefly to his fellow reporters. Visibly shaken, he said that the victims were \u201cjust trying to do their job for the public.\u201d \u201cSomething like this might happen in Afghanistan or Iraq or something like that, but you don\u2019t expect it in a sleepy office across the street from a local mall,\u201d he said, before promising that the Capital Gazette would be published on Friday: \u201cWe\u2019re still putting out a newspaper.\u201d When asked if he had any message for others, Furgurson choked up and paused for a minute. \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny about peace, love and understanding,\u201d he said, before walking away. He had a story to file. At this evening\u2019s press conference, Krampf provided further information and some clarifications about the shooting: The suspect is a white male in his late 30s who is a resident of Maryland. The suspected explosive device recovered by law enforcement was actually canisters of smoke grenades, some of which the suspect used inside the building. Krampf said he had no information about the reports that the suspect had mutilated his fingerprints, nor about the use of facial recognition technology for identification. Law enforcement has secured the suspect\u2019s residence and is working on getting search warrants. The mass shooting that left five people dead at the headquarters of an Annapolis newspaper was \u201ca targeted attack on the Capital Gazette\u201d, acting police chief William Krampf said at a press conference. \u201cThis person was prepared to shoot people,\u201d Krampf said of the suspect. \u201cHis intent was to cause harm.\u201d Authorities have not released any information as to a motive for the attack, but Krampf said that they were investigating threats sent to the Capital Gazette through social media as recently as today. The threats \u201cindicated violence\u201d, Krampf said. In addition to the five fatalities, at least three people were taken to hospital with injuries. A spokesperson for the University of Maryland Medical Center\u2019s Shock Trauma Center confirmed by email that the hospital is treating one victim, but did not provide any further information about the patient\u2019s status. A spokeswoman for Anne Arundel Medical Center in Annapolis said that the hospital had treated two patients with minor injuries. One of the victims has already been discharged, the spokeswoman said, and the second is likely to be discharged tonight. The Associated Press is reporting that the suspect in the shooting mutilated his fingers in an apparent attempt to prevent law enforcement from identifying him by his fingerprints. Despite the mutilation, however, investigators were able to identify the suspect using facial recognition technology, according to the AP. The suspect\u2019s identity has not been released to the public. NBC News has shared footage of President Trump walking past a group of reporters who shout questions about the shooting. Trump had tweeted his \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d for the victims and their families earlier in the day, but did not respond to questions as he made his way into the White House. \u201cWill you please talk to us about the dead reporters in Annapolis?\u201d one reporter shouted, as Trump kept walking. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders tweeted a condemnation of the \u201cevil act of senseless violence\u201d, adding: \u201cA violent attack on innocent journalists doing their job is an attack on every American.\u201d Sanders\u2019 tweet follows a brief exchange between the White House pool reporter and White House deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters: \u201cAsked about the president\u2019s criticism of the press corps she said the president and his staff do not believe violence is acceptable in any situation \u2018and we stand by that.\u2019\u201d Law enforcement has not released any information as to a possible motive for the attack. Anne Arundel County executive Steve Schuh told the Associated Press that the suspect \u201chas not been very forthcoming\u201d. \u201cTo my knowledge, there was no verbal aspect to the incident where he declared his motives or anything else, so at this point we just don\u2019t know,\u201d Schuh said. The Baltimore Sun has published a history of its sister newspapers, the Maryland Gazette and the Capital. The Maryland Gazette was founded in 1727, making it the seventh newspaper in what is now the United States. \u201cIn July 1776, the Gazette was one of the first newspapers to publish the Declaration of Independence, although it appeared on page 2; then, as now, local news took precedence,\u201d writes Sun reporter Chris Kaltenbach. The Capital was founded in 1884, and the two papers merged in 1919. The papers were sold to the Baltimore Sun Media Group in 2014. Jimmy DeButts, an editor for the Capital Gazette, wrote about the work of the paper\u2019s staff in a series of tweets. Capital Gazette reporter Chase Cook reiterated Joshua McKerrow\u2019s promise in a tweet, writing, \u201cI can tell you this: We are putting out a damn paper tomorrow.\u201d Ben Jacobs is on the ground at the site of the shooting. The scene in Annapolis mixed the mundane with the grotesque. The office building that held the Capital Gazette was ringed by emergency vehicles of every type: police cars, fire trucks, ambulances and a mobile command center or two. Helicopters whirled over ahead while police officers in tactical vests and even camouflage milled about off in the distance The building, across the street from a popular shopping mall, could have been anywhere the the United States from Annapolis, Maryland to Yuma, Arizona. It held a variety of professional offices. There were banks with a drive through in windows both in front of the offices and across the service street that led into its parking lot. The media nestled in a small bank of grass next to the shopping mall in front of a strip mall that advertised a \u201cpsychotherapeutics services\u201d offices. A long row of camera crews stretched nearly a block with reporters from all over the world speaking in several different languages. This is Julia Carrie Wong, taking over our live coverage of the Capital Gazette shooting from San Francisco. The staff of the Capital Gazette are continuing to work and report amid extraordinary and tragic circumstances. Joshua McKerrow, a photojournalist who said he was not in the newsroom at the time of the shooting, has been sharing photographs from the scene on Twitter. Shortly after 6pm local time, he tweeted a promise that there will be a paper produced on Friday. Pat Ferguson, another Capital journalist, reportedly told a CNBC reporter and former colleague that he is hard at work, \u201ccharging his phone, trying to find colleagues and \u2018putting out a paper, goddamn it\u2019\u201d. Ben Jacobs, who is on the ground in Annapolis, has been speaking to witnesses. Carlos Linares, a mechanical engineer from Southern Maryland, was on the fourth floor of the building to see his lawyer when he heard a man shouting at about 2:55. He didn\u2019t think much of it until several minutes later when he heard \u201ca commotion\u201d outside the conference room, saw people in \u201cthe corridor and the lobby\u201d, and was told there was an active shooter. Within a few minutes a police officer arrived and told everyone to stay where they were, Linares recalled. The police later escorted everyone out of the building with their hands up, and Linares noticed broken glass scattered on the ground on the first floor. \u201cI\u2019ve never see so many cops in my life,\u201d he said, describing seeing police in every direction and helicopters in the sky. Linares said he was asked why he was so calm while they were waiting in the lobby. He said that he had been in the Pentagon on 9/11, albeit on the other side of the building. At a press conference in Annapolis, local police have updated reporters on a few key details. Police have not been yet been able to identify the suspect, who remains in police custody and is currently being interrogated. Lt Ryan Frashure described the suspected shooter as a white man. He said he is suspected to have used a long gun in the attack. Acting Anne Arundel county police department chief William Krampf said that officers recovered a suspected explosive device that has now \u201cbeen taken care of\u201d. The death toll remains at five. None of the victims have been identified in public. Lt Frashure said that the suspect did not exchange gunfire with responding officers. Steve Schuh, county executive of Anne Arundel county, told CNN immediately after that the suspect was found by officers underneath a desk. His weapon was discovered on the ground close by. Four victims died at the scene. One died in hospital, Schuh said. Ben Jacobs is now on the ground in Annapolis. He\u2019s been speaking to workers in the same building as the Capital Gazette, who heard the shooting unfold. Bethany Clasing, a legal assistant who works a floor above the Capital-Gazette, initially wasn\u2019t sure what she was hearing. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was gunshots at first and then I heard the police and realized it has to be gunshots,\u201d she told reporters. Working in an office with her mother, she had to convince her mother what was happening. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely the police they were shouting to get down,\u201d said Clasing. She said there was a fast police response and that \u201cpretty soon after the gun shots they were up the floor and telling us to get out.\u201d They were then evacuated across the street to a shopping mall. Looking back at the experience, Clasing said \u201cI was really confused at first, it\u2019s not like you would expect someone to come and shoot up this building.\u201d We\u2019re expecting another press briefing at 5:30 ET, some reporters on the scene are suggesting that the death toll of five, which was announced earlier, may now be updated. Capital Gazette staffers posted a number of distressing eyewitness accounts to Twitter as the shooting unfolded. Other Gazette reporters captured the immediate aftermath of the shooting from outside the office. Police have yet to ascribe any motive to the shooter, despite being asked multiple times during a press conference outside the Capital Gazette\u2019s headquarters minutes ago. CNN are quoting anonymous law enforcement sources saying the suspect is not assisting investigators and not answering questions during interview. The Guardian has not been able to verify these claims, but officers confirmed the suspect was still being interviewed at the time of the press conference. Thursday\u2019s shooting is not the first time a local newsroom has found itself the target of a gun attack. In August 2015, a disturbed former employee for WDBJ7 TV news in Roanaoke, Virginia opened fire on journalist Alison Parker and cameraman Adam Ward during an on-air interview. About 40,000 viewers reportedly watched the journalists\u2019 murder live \u2013 including their own shocked colleagues. Officials said the perpetrator, a former reporter for the station who had been fired, died after shooting himself. The woman being interviewed during the broadcast, a local economic development executive, was also shot, but survived. Chris Hurst, a former WBDJ7 journalist and Parker\u2019s boyfriend at the time, later left journalism and successfully ran for state office on a gun violence prevention platform. President Trump, traveling in the state of Wisconsin, sent his \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d to the victims and their families via Twitter. Phil Davis, a courts and crime reporter for the Capital Gazette was inside the building when the shooter opened fire. He\u2019s given a detailed interview to the Baltimore Sun, the Gazette\u2019s sister paper, describing a \u201cwar zone\u201d inside his newsroom as the attack took place. I\u2019m a police reporter. I write about this stuff \u2014 not necessarily to this extent, but shootings and death \u2014 all the time. But as much as I\u2019m going to try to articulate how traumatizing it is to be hiding under your desk, you don\u2019t know until you\u2019re there and you feel helpless The report continues: Davis said he and others were still hiding under their desks when the shooter stopped firing. \u201cI don\u2019t know why. I don\u2019t know why he stopped,\u201d Davis said. Police then arrived and surrounded the shooter, Davis said. He declined to elaborate. As the press conference comes to an end, acting Anne Arundel county police department chief William Krampf confirms five people have been killed in the shooting and several others \u201cgravely injured\u201d. Maryland governor Larry Hogan said earlier: \u201cYour heart goes out to all the people who lost their lives, all their families.\u201d Hogan said police responded to the incident within 60 seconds of the shooting beginning. They would not comment on what type of weapon the shooter used in the attack. Police are not able to confirm whereabout in the building the shooting occurred, says Lt. Ryan Frashure of the Anne Arundel County police department. Frashure confirms there is only one suspect in the shooting and the building has now been cleared. City and county officials have confirmed at a press conference that \u201cseveral people\u201d have been killed in the shooting and \u201cseveral\u201d others injured. The officials confirm that the shooter is in custody. The suspect is currently being interviewed by detectives. Police in Annapolis, Maryland are responding to a shooting at the headquarters of the Capital Gazette. An eyewitness account, posted on Twitter by a Capital Gazette reporter, indicate a gunman opened fire on multiple people inside the building. Reports indicate the shooter has been taken into custody. Two state highways were closed in Anne Arundel county Maryland because of police activity, according to the state\u2019s highway administration. A spokeswoman for Donald Trump said the president had been briefed on the shooting, according to a pool report. \u201cOur thoughts and prayers are with all that are affected,\u201d said the spokeswoman, Lindsay Walters.

          "body": "<p>Next Thursday is <a href=\"https://nationaldaycalendar.com/national-handshake-day-last-thursday-in-june/\">national handshake day</a>, in the US at least \u2013 a day no one observes, or if they do, no one notices. Handshakes are boring, right? Men in suits, sealing a deal. Politicians playing for the camera. The escape hatch of awkward Britons, unsure whether two kisses are called for, or a kiss and a hug, and then bottling it altogether. Who cares? I\u2019ll tell you \u2013 I care. As a teen, my social goals revolved around attaining an elaborately choreographed, best friends\u2019 handshake \u2013 practised yet insouciant, a finger-slapping, synchronous back and forth with over-the-shoulder detail, and explosive sound effects. It is still all I want, and I have widened the remit to include it in my relationship and career goals, too. </p> <p>Originally, the handshake was a greeting that allowed parties to check no one had a dagger up their sleeve. (Imagine life in the old days: \u201cGreat to see you! You\u2019re not going to stab me, are you? Let\u2019s drink, and slosh wine between our cups, to check we\u2019re not trying to poison each other. Nice to catch up.\u201d) <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/mar/03/palm-scent-the-science-of-smelling-after-a-handshake\">The latest research</a> suggests handshaking is a way to assess sexual compatibility and competition, as we frequently sniff our hands after shaking. I think I would find a dagger less unsettling.</p> <p>The future looks dark for the handshake, too. It has been co-opted as a display of dominance in business. I think self-consciously \u201cstrong\u201d handshakes are creepy. Are receivers meant to be impressed, confused into believing they are meeting <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://transformersprime.wikia.com/wiki/Optimus_Prime\">Optimus Prime</a>? Yet there are hundreds of articles on the art of \u201cpower shakes\u201d. Place your hand palm down over your opponent\u2019s, so they are forced into the submissive position. For photographs, stand on the left, so your right arm crosses your body, accentuating the bicep. Tips on the double palm grasp, when to encroach the wrist. Footwork, strength and length. Study the rules, win the game. The game of saying hello.</p> <p>The nuclear display of this arseholery belongs, of course, to the US\u2019s child-catcher in chief. Watching <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/shortcuts/2018/apr/25/the-art-of-the-feel-why-trump-is-master-of-the-awkward-greeting\">Donald Trump shake hands</a> with heads of state is to witness the worst of the handshake. The unbalancing yank, the patronising pat. He is unpredictable, too \u2013 shaking with Japan\u2019s Shinz\u014d Abe for 19 hideous seconds, but refusing Angela Merkel\u2019s offer entirely. On a tour of the White House, he held Theresa May\u2019s hand as if showing her a crab in a rock pool. I admit to enjoying the countertactics leaders use. Boxing-trained Justin Trudeau holds Trump\u2019s shoulder, to crush his yank-nonsense. Gritty little Emmanuel Macron digs in, pumping harder and longer until all their teeth fall out. (They went to 30 seconds on Bastille Day, before going in for another round. Not quite Thriller in Manila, but possibly the Embarrass at Paris.) India\u2019s prime minister Modi nestles in for a daddy bear hug, a disorienting move of his own. This is my primary engagement with politics now. To be fair, I think it\u2019s Donald\u2019s, too.</p> <p>If there is anything notable about your own technique, you\u2019re doing it wrong. Maybe the best handshake involves no contact. Last week\u2019s <a href=\"https://keepincalendar.com/June-21/World-Handshake-Day/598\">world handshake day</a> \u2013 not to be confused with national handshake day \u2013 is a different idea. Everyone who can puts their hand in the sea, or a sea-bound river, as a way of connecting with others doing the same across the world. Wishy-washy to some, but I like it. Equality and goodwill are what handshakes symbolise, and what they should feel like. Feels as if we are running low on both.</p>",

          "bodyText": "Next Thursday is national handshake day, in the US at least \u2013 a day no one observes, or if they do, no one notices. Handshakes are boring, right? Men in suits, sealing a deal. Politicians playing for the camera. The escape hatch of awkward Britons, unsure whether two kisses are called for, or a kiss and a hug, and then bottling it altogether. Who cares? I\u2019ll tell you \u2013 I care. As a teen, my social goals revolved around attaining an elaborately choreographed, best friends\u2019 handshake \u2013 practised yet insouciant, a finger-slapping, synchronous back and forth with over-the-shoulder detail, and explosive sound effects. It is still all I want, and I have widened the remit to include it in my relationship and career goals, too. Originally, the handshake was a greeting that allowed parties to check no one had a dagger up their sleeve. (Imagine life in the old days: \u201cGreat to see you! You\u2019re not going to stab me, are you? Let\u2019s drink, and slosh wine between our cups, to check we\u2019re not trying to poison each other. Nice to catch up.\u201d) The latest research suggests handshaking is a way to assess sexual compatibility and competition, as we frequently sniff our hands after shaking. I think I would find a dagger less unsettling. The future looks dark for the handshake, too. It has been co-opted as a display of dominance in business. I think self-consciously \u201cstrong\u201d handshakes are creepy. Are receivers meant to be impressed, confused into believing they are meeting Optimus Prime? Yet there are hundreds of articles on the art of \u201cpower shakes\u201d. Place your hand palm down over your opponent\u2019s, so they are forced into the submissive position. For photographs, stand on the left, so your right arm crosses your body, accentuating the bicep. Tips on the double palm grasp, when to encroach the wrist. Footwork, strength and length. Study the rules, win the game. The game of saying hello. The nuclear display of this arseholery belongs, of course, to the US\u2019s child-catcher in chief. Watching Donald Trump shake hands with heads of state is to witness the worst of the handshake. The unbalancing yank, the patronising pat. He is unpredictable, too \u2013 shaking with Japan\u2019s Shinz\u014d Abe for 19 hideous seconds, but refusing Angela Merkel\u2019s offer entirely. On a tour of the White House, he held Theresa May\u2019s hand as if showing her a crab in a rock pool. I admit to enjoying the countertactics leaders use. Boxing-trained Justin Trudeau holds Trump\u2019s shoulder, to crush his yank-nonsense. Gritty little Emmanuel Macron digs in, pumping harder and longer until all their teeth fall out. (They went to 30 seconds on Bastille Day, before going in for another round. Not quite Thriller in Manila, but possibly the Embarrass at Paris.) India\u2019s prime minister Modi nestles in for a daddy bear hug, a disorienting move of his own. This is my primary engagement with politics now. To be fair, I think it\u2019s Donald\u2019s, too. If there is anything notable about your own technique, you\u2019re doing it wrong. Maybe the best handshake involves no contact. Last week\u2019s world handshake day \u2013 not to be confused with national handshake day \u2013 is a different idea. Everyone who can puts their hand in the sea, or a sea-bound river, as a way of connecting with others doing the same across the world. Wishy-washy to some, but I like it. Equality and goodwill are what handshakes symbolise, and what they should feel like. Feels as if we are running low on both.",

The surveillance officers had instructions to arrest him if they saw him alone with someone else.</p> <p>They ascended to McArthur\u2019s 19th-floor apartment and broke down the door. Inside, they found his companion already tied to the bed.</p> <p>McArthur was charged with the murder of Andrew Kinsman, 49, who had gone missing shortly after Pride Day on 26 June 2017, and Selim Esen, 44, who was reported missing about two months earlier.</p> <p>As a particularly cold winter dragged on into February, the city was horrified as police began to unearth the remains of corpses buried inside more than a dozen decorative planters. The planters were located outside a modest home, on Mallory Crescent in the Leaside area of the city, where McArthur had been employed as a gardener.</p> <p>Police issued a plea to anyone who might have used McArthur\u2019s services, and deployed cadaver dogs to multiple locations across Toronto. They erected tents and used heaters to thaw the frozen ground.

From 2010 to 2017, gay men had been disappearing in alarming numbers from Toronto\u2019s lively gay village. Many locals had long suspected a serial killer.</p> <p>Long-simmering tensions with the Toronto police boiled over. Organisers demanded to know why the force hadn\u2019t taken their fears more seriously. Some argued that police were too slow to warn the community of a possible serial killer, saying lives could have been saved.</p> <p>To make matters worse, Toronto police appeared to put some blame on the gay community for the killings when <a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/toronto-police-chief-says-civilians-failed-to-help-investigation-into-alleged-serial-killer/article38124737/\">chief Mark Saunders told reporters</a> that they might have caught McArthur sooner had residents of the gay village been more forthcoming. \u201cWe knew that people were missing and we knew we didn\u2019t have the right answers,\u201d Saunders said. \u201cBut nobody was coming to us with anything.\u201d</p> <p>Toronto police had already been banned in 2017 from the Gay Pride parade, following lobbying from Toronto\u2019s chapter of Black Lives Matter. Their request to participate in 2018 was refused.<br></p> <p>Then, in April, in a move that some have interpreted as an acknowledgment of their neglect of the gay community, police announced that they were reopening 25 cold cases \u2013 all murders associated with Toronto\u2019s gay village. </p> <p>They date from 1997 all the way back to 1975. </p> <p>And no one is suggesting it is over.</p> <h2><strong>From Santa to serial killer</strong></h2> <p>While investigators are still developing a profile of the alleged serial killer, they are certain of one thing. The jolly-looking McArthur, who is divorced and has two grown children, did not have the menacing countenance of a serial murderer. </p> <p>In fact, he was so convincingly harmless looking that he was able to play Santa in at least one suburban shopping mall. His age, as well as his unthreatening appearance \u2013 round features and a broad, cheery smile \u2013 made him seem approachable to children shopping with their parents, as well as to gay men seeking a dark sexual encounter with someone they could trust.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"899400eadd7da41f57abaf74e3a8fa732f4911f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/899400eadd7da41f57abaf74e3a8fa732f4911f4/0_50_750_938/400.jpg\" alt=\"Bruce McArthur in a photo posted on a social media account.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bruce McArthur in a photo posted on a social media account.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After divorcing his wife, McArthur, who had been active on his church board in Oshawa, east of Toronto, became a regular in the city\u2019s gay village. He trolled hook-up sites like Manjam and Recon, where the \u201csilver fox\u201d made his taste for submissive men clear \u2013 especially those who wanted to test the limits of their curiosity for dangerous sex.</p> <p>McArthur had been brought to the attention of local police in 2002, when he was arrested for attacking a gay prostitute with a metal bar. He was sentenced in 2003 to two years probation and told to stay away from the gay village.</p> <p>In 2010, reports started to come through of men going missing from the village. The first, Skandaraj Navaratnam, rests particularly heavily on the mind of Haran Vijayanathan, executive director of the Alliance for South Asian Aids Prevention (ASAAP). </p> <p>Both men are Sri Lankan, Tamil and gay. \u201cI saw myself in Skanda,\u201d says Vijayanathan. \u201cHe represents my greatest fear.\u201d</p> <p>That fear \u2013 one faced by immigrant and refugee men in an unfamiliar gay community \u2013 is nothing new. Just as gay men from North Bay and Moose Jaw flocked to Toronto in the 1970s to live free and open lives, a new generation of gay men from south Asia and the Middle East have been drawn to Canada in the last 20 years for the same reasons. The new arrivals may revel in Canada\u2019s acceptance, but they are still vulnerable \u2013 still suspicious of authority, reluctant to attract attention, perhaps too eager to fit in. And perhaps too trusting of a gentle-looking older man who appears harmless.</p> <p>Predators thrive on marginalized groups, says University of Toronto associate professor of sociology Jooyoung Lee, an expert in violent crime and serial homicide.

As long as 40 years ago, 14 gay men were murdered in Toronto in just a few years. Seven of those cases remain unsolved.</p> <p>The brutal stabbing death of William Duncan Robinson at his home in November 1978 came shortly after the popular 1970s gay magazine the Body Politic to question the sluggish police response to the string of murders, and the official stance that they were unrelated: \u201cCould they have been committed by one man?\u201d asked an <a href=\"https://archive.org/stream/bodypolitic50toro/bodypolitic50toro_djvu.txt\">October 1978 headline</a>. \u201cThe police aren\u2019t saying. But the crimes do show a certain similarity \u2026\u201d</p> <p>It has been suggested that McArthur, who has not yet entered a plea in the eight charges nor been charged for any of the cold cases, could be responsible for some of those murders. Serial killers rarely begin their murder sprees late in life, and McArthur would have been in his 20s and early 30s back then. Critics dispute that theory by pointing to a very different manner of execution and body disposal: the 1970s murders were mostly stabbings, and the victims were left where they were killed.</p> <p>What is indisputable is that police never caught the killer, or killers \u2013 and it\u2019s hardly a stretch to imagine that they didn\u2019t feel much pressure to do so in the homophobic atmosphere of the era.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/22/toronto-gay-bathhouse-raids-operation-soap-police-apology\">Toronto police chief to apologize for 1981 gay bathhouse raids</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was a holiday tradition each Halloween during the 1960s and 70s for Toronto residents to taunt gay men, especially drag queens, as they entered bars on Yonge Street like the St Charles Tavern and the Parkside.

Men were arrested and charged according to the city\u2019s antiquated bawdy house laws.</p> <p>A few of the officers were apologetic, but another boisterous contingent \u201cseemed to enjoy it \u2013 like jocks in a frat house\u201d, says Hooper.</p> <p>By morning, 250 men had been charged. The humiliation caused some to contemplate suicide. Others were fired from their jobs after police officers called their employers. Many lost the support of family and friends.</p> <p>The raids were a tipping point for Toronto\u2019s gay community. Like the Stonewall riots in New York, the bathhouse raids ignited a fury that led to the city\u2019s modern gay pride movement. Though there had been small events held in previous years, the first official Pride parade was held that spring.</p> <p>Now it\u2019s one of the largest in the world: when the 38th annual Toronto Pride parade takes place this coming Sunday, it will attract close to one million spectators.

He says he is disheartened by the accounts of the bathhouse raids and the history of police hostility. \u201cI\u2019m open to criticism,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a byproduct of the job.

Assured that they are engaging in role playing, such men submit to their putative captors, who methodically and ritualistically push them to \u2013 and perhaps beyond \u2013 their \u201cedge\u201d.</p> <p>Sean Cribbin, 50, was one man who had experimented in this fashion. Last summer, he says accepted an online invitation to meet McArthur early one afternoon.</p> <p>Almost a year later, he marvels that he is alive. </p> <p>A former Mr Leatherman in Toronto, Cribbin <a href=\"https://globalnews.ca/news/4063145/bruce-mcarthur-sean-cribbin-date-with-alleged-serial-killer/\">told Global TV</a> in a wide-ranging interview that he felt comfortable submitting to McArthur\u2019s wishes because he looked so unthreatening. </p> <p>He even brought up the rumour of a serial killer attacking gay men in Toronto, but says McArthur didn\u2019t respond.</p> <p>Unlike McArthur, Cribbin has a tough appearance: sleeve tattoos, a black beard and a thick nose ring. But his voice is soft and his comments thoughtful. \u201cI was the lucky one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could happen to anyone.\u201d</p> <p>First, Cribbin says he accepted the GHB cocktail prepared by McArthur, having asked him to limit the dose to 5ml \u2013 the right amount to put him at ease, cause euphoria and \u201cheighten the sexual encounter\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What if the roommate hadn\u2019t arrived home when he did?

For the first time in his life, he\u2019s afraid of the dark, and he worries the experience may turn him off sex completely.<br></p> <p>\u201cWhat if the roommate hadn\u2019t arrived home when he did?\u201d Cribbin said. \u201cI would have simply disappeared.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018One foot in the department and one foot in the gay community\u2019</h2> <p>Police may never unearth the full extent of McArthur\u2019s alleged carnage, but if it is proven in court it could be compared to the atrocities of Jeffrey Dahmer, who killed 17 boys in Milwaukee between 1978 and 1991, or John Wayne Gacy, who murdered 33 young men and boys between 1972 and 1978 in Cook County, Illinois. As the investigation deepens, police are under tremendous pressure to solve the crimes \u2013 which means trying to understand the man that investigators think is behind them.</p> <p>\u201c[McArthur] probably got a kick out of tricking men into believing he was harmless,\u201d says Lee, who knows that investigators are struggling to get inside McArthur\u2019s head, investigating his social circles and his online activities. Investigators will also want to understand the rituals associated with the killings and the complicated procedures involved in the disposal of his victims\u2019 remains \u2013 not least how to fit the corpses into the planters. (Many have speculated that McArthur\u2019s job as a landscaper could involve the use of equipment such as chainsaws and wood chippers.)</p> <p>Lee believes McArthur was probably in a perpetual search \u201cfor the next kill that would top the last one. [Serial killers] become overwhelmed by the fantasy, constantly studying the craft of killing, the details of the murder and the memory of his actions afterward \u2026 He would get a small rush every time he revisited the remains of the people he killed.\u201d</p> <p>How McArthur may have slipped up, or why police decided to place him under surveillance, Idsinga won\u2019t say. But, according to Lee, one thing is certain. \u201cKilling requires practice,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are seldom perfect in the beginning.

          "bodyText": "When the biggest forensic investigation in Toronto history began, it was still possible to be blind to the full extent of the horror. On 18 January 2018, in the mid-morning, Bruce McArthur, a 66-year-old freelance landscaper, entered his Thorncliffe Park apartment building in Toronto, accompanied by a young man. McArthur had been placed under 24-hour police watch the previous day. The surveillance officers had instructions to arrest him if they saw him alone with someone else. They ascended to McArthur\u2019s 19th-floor apartment and broke down the door. Inside, they found his companion already tied to the bed. McArthur was charged with the murder of Andrew Kinsman, 49, who had gone missing shortly after Pride Day on 26 June 2017, and Selim Esen, 44, who was reported missing about two months earlier. As a particularly cold winter dragged on into February, the city was horrified as police began to unearth the remains of corpses buried inside more than a dozen decorative planters. The planters were located outside a modest home, on Mallory Crescent in the Leaside area of the city, where McArthur had been employed as a gardener. Police issued a plea to anyone who might have used McArthur\u2019s services, and deployed cadaver dogs to multiple locations across Toronto. They erected tents and used heaters to thaw the frozen ground. Forensic investigators combed over McArthur\u2019s two-bedroom apartment for months, removing 1,800 pieces of evidence and photographing every square inch. The number of murder charges grew to five (Majeed Kayhan, 58; Dean Lisowick, 47; and Soroush Mahmudi, 50), then eight (Skandaraj Navaratnam, 40; Abdulbasir Faizi, 44; and Kirushna Kumar Kanagaratnam, 37). Six of the men were south Asian or Middle Eastern. All of them were gay. The LGBT community in Toronto was shocked, bereaved \u2013 and furious. From 2010 to 2017, gay men had been disappearing in alarming numbers from Toronto\u2019s lively gay village. Many locals had long suspected a serial killer. Long-simmering tensions with the Toronto police boiled over. Organisers demanded to know why the force hadn\u2019t taken their fears more seriously. Some argued that police were too slow to warn the community of a possible serial killer, saying lives could have been saved. To make matters worse, Toronto police appeared to put some blame on the gay community for the killings when chief Mark Saunders told reporters that they might have caught McArthur sooner had residents of the gay village been more forthcoming. \u201cWe knew that people were missing and we knew we didn\u2019t have the right answers,\u201d Saunders said. \u201cBut nobody was coming to us with anything.\u201d Toronto police had already been banned in 2017 from the Gay Pride parade, following lobbying from Toronto\u2019s chapter of Black Lives Matter. Their request to participate in 2018 was refused. Then, in April, in a move that some have interpreted as an acknowledgment of their neglect of the gay community, police announced that they were reopening 25 cold cases \u2013 all murders associated with Toronto\u2019s gay village. They date from 1997 all the way back to 1975. And no one is suggesting it is over. From Santa to serial killer While investigators are still developing a profile of the alleged serial killer, they are certain of one thing. The jolly-looking McArthur, who is divorced and has two grown children, did not have the menacing countenance of a serial murderer. In fact, he was so convincingly harmless looking that he was able to play Santa in at least one suburban shopping mall. His age, as well as his unthreatening appearance \u2013 round features and a broad, cheery smile \u2013 made him seem approachable to children shopping with their parents, as well as to gay men seeking a dark sexual encounter with someone they could trust. After divorcing his wife, McArthur, who had been active on his church board in Oshawa, east of Toronto, became a regular in the city\u2019s gay village. He trolled hook-up sites like Manjam and Recon, where the \u201csilver fox\u201d made his taste for submissive men clear \u2013 especially those who wanted to test the limits of their curiosity for dangerous sex. McArthur had been brought to the attention of local police in 2002, when he was arrested for attacking a gay prostitute with a metal bar. He was sentenced in 2003 to two years probation and told to stay away from the gay village. In 2010, reports started to come through of men going missing from the village. The first, Skandaraj Navaratnam, rests particularly heavily on the mind of Haran Vijayanathan, executive director of the Alliance for South Asian Aids Prevention (ASAAP). Both men are Sri Lankan, Tamil and gay. \u201cI saw myself in Skanda,\u201d says Vijayanathan. \u201cHe represents my greatest fear.\u201d That fear \u2013 one faced by immigrant and refugee men in an unfamiliar gay community \u2013 is nothing new. Just as gay men from North Bay and Moose Jaw flocked to Toronto in the 1970s to live free and open lives, a new generation of gay men from south Asia and the Middle East have been drawn to Canada in the last 20 years for the same reasons. The new arrivals may revel in Canada\u2019s acceptance, but they are still vulnerable \u2013 still suspicious of authority, reluctant to attract attention, perhaps too eager to fit in. And perhaps too trusting of a gentle-looking older man who appears harmless. Predators thrive on marginalized groups, says University of Toronto associate professor of sociology Jooyoung Lee, an expert in violent crime and serial homicide. Gay men \u2013 particularly gay refugees or other relatively new Canadians \u2013 fit into a population that includes prostitutes, aboriginal women and immigrants. And then there is what Lee refers to as \u201cmissing white woman syndrome\u201d: the idea that police, media and the public are less inclined to pay attention to crimes that are perpetrated on marginalized communities. Vijayanathan, who is one of the most outspoken critics of how Toronto let its gay community down, insists that police only took the investigations seriously when Andrew Kinsman, one of two white victims, was reported missing. But he also points to racism within the gay community \u2013 comparing the massive local search mounted after the reported disappearance of the other white victim, Andrew Kinsman, with the slower and less cohesive response to the disappearances of the brown-skinned victims. Vijayanathan also believes the families of some of the missing immigrant men failed to report their disappearance. In some cases, he says, the disappearances were the first time family members learned their relative was gay (or MSM, men who have sex with men but don\u2019t identify as gay). Others worried about interfering in a family member\u2019s claim for refugee status. Still others worked under the table and didn\u2019t want to attract the attention of authorities. For example, Kirushna Kumar Kanagaratnam was a Tamil refugee who came to Canada in 2016 and was never reported missing, and after Navaratnam\u2019s refugee claim was denied he rarely left the confines of the gay village. \u201cThroughout our history, people have come to the city as a refuge and a place to explore their sexuality \u2013 often without the knowledge of their family and friends,\u201d says Tom Hooper, a York University historian who has devoted much of his studies to the gay experience in Toronto in the 1970s. But Hooper also points the finger at police. \u201cFor both gay men in the 1970s and queer people of colour today, the police have been enforcers but not protectors. Isolation, combined with a fear of police, has marginalized members of our community and made them more vulnerable to violence.\u201d Homophobic atmosphere The difficult relationship between Toronto\u2019s gay community and police force coincides with reports of missing gay men going back decades. As long as 40 years ago, 14 gay men were murdered in Toronto in just a few years. Seven of those cases remain unsolved. The brutal stabbing death of William Duncan Robinson at his home in November 1978 came shortly after the popular 1970s gay magazine the Body Politic to question the sluggish police response to the string of murders, and the official stance that they were unrelated: \u201cCould they have been committed by one man?\u201d asked an October 1978 headline. \u201cThe police aren\u2019t saying. But the crimes do show a certain similarity \u2026\u201d It has been suggested that McArthur, who has not yet entered a plea in the eight charges nor been charged for any of the cold cases, could be responsible for some of those murders. Serial killers rarely begin their murder sprees late in life, and McArthur would have been in his 20s and early 30s back then. Critics dispute that theory by pointing to a very different manner of execution and body disposal: the 1970s murders were mostly stabbings, and the victims were left where they were killed. What is indisputable is that police never caught the killer, or killers \u2013 and it\u2019s hardly a stretch to imagine that they didn\u2019t feel much pressure to do so in the homophobic atmosphere of the era. It was a holiday tradition each Halloween during the 1960s and 70s for Toronto residents to taunt gay men, especially drag queens, as they entered bars on Yonge Street like the St Charles Tavern and the Parkside. They pelted eggs, which turned into rocks, which turned into beatings on darkened side streets. Police mostly looked the other way, recalls the Rev Brent Hawkes, a longtime leader of the city\u2019s gay rights movement who was once himself restrained on a sidewalk by two officers as a third punched him. \u201cStories of men being arrested and taken to Cherry Beach for a beating were common,\u201d he says. Officers would lurk beside the urinals in bars, waiting for men to engage in a sexual act. Entrapment was widespread at department stores, universities and hotels such as Hudson\u2019s Bay, the Royal York and the University of Toronto. \u201cSex had to be quick and anonymous,\u201d says Hooper. \u201cThere was no courtship that led to sex. If you were married and lived in the suburbs \u2013 and you were gay \u2013 you had to hook up on your lunch break.\u201d The constant harassment by police reach the boiling point in 1981, when 200 police officers descended on four gay bathhouses. They marched through the corridors, swinging crowbars and sledgehammers, breaking down doors and corralling groups of men into showers and lounge areas. One officer reportedly commented that he wished the showers were hooked up to gas, Hooper said. Men were arrested and charged according to the city\u2019s antiquated bawdy house laws. A few of the officers were apologetic, but another boisterous contingent \u201cseemed to enjoy it \u2013 like jocks in a frat house\u201d, says Hooper. By morning, 250 men had been charged. The humiliation caused some to contemplate suicide. Others were fired from their jobs after police officers called their employers. Many lost the support of family and friends. The raids were a tipping point for Toronto\u2019s gay community. Like the Stonewall riots in New York, the bathhouse raids ignited a fury that led to the city\u2019s modern gay pride movement. Though there had been small events held in previous years, the first official Pride parade was held that spring. Now it\u2019s one of the largest in the world: when the 38th annual Toronto Pride parade takes place this coming Sunday, it will attract close to one million spectators. Sponsors include Home Depot and New Balance, and regular attendees include the prime minster, Justin Trudeau, and the mayor of Toronto, John Tory. But even as Toronto\u2019s more established gay community gains strength, new arrivals continue to lead marginal, vulnerable lives. DS Hank Idsinga, 50, the lead investigator on the most high-profile of murder cases, is keenly aware of media criticism that police did not take the missing persons reports or speculation of a serial killer seriously because the men were gay and mostly brown-skinned. Idsinga, who joined police services in 1989, acknowledges it will take time to regain the trust of the gay community. He says he is disheartened by the accounts of the bathhouse raids and the history of police hostility. \u201cI\u2019m open to criticism,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a byproduct of the job. You can block it out or you can listen.\u201d He points out that he was recently scolded by a reporter for using the expression \u201cgay lifestyle\u201d, and promises: \u201cI will avoid the term from now on.\u201d The decision to open the cold cases \u2013 Idsinga estimates the number of unresolved cases of murdered gay men at 20 or more \u2013 is a belated attempt to make something very wrong at least a bit more right. \u201cI\u2019m not that police officer from 30 years ago,\u201d he says of his attitude to the past. \u201cWhat can I do to help now?\u201d A community at risk There has always been a small community of gay men who thrill at risky sex, bondage, humiliation and even torture. Assured that they are engaging in role playing, such men submit to their putative captors, who methodically and ritualistically push them to \u2013 and perhaps beyond \u2013 their \u201cedge\u201d. Sean Cribbin, 50, was one man who had experimented in this fashion. Last summer, he says accepted an online invitation to meet McArthur early one afternoon. Almost a year later, he marvels that he is alive. A former Mr Leatherman in Toronto, Cribbin told Global TV in a wide-ranging interview that he felt comfortable submitting to McArthur\u2019s wishes because he looked so unthreatening. He even brought up the rumour of a serial killer attacking gay men in Toronto, but says McArthur didn\u2019t respond. Unlike McArthur, Cribbin has a tough appearance: sleeve tattoos, a black beard and a thick nose ring. But his voice is soft and his comments thoughtful. \u201cI was the lucky one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could happen to anyone.\u201d First, Cribbin says he accepted the GHB cocktail prepared by McArthur, having asked him to limit the dose to 5ml \u2013 the right amount to put him at ease, cause euphoria and \u201cheighten the sexual encounter\u201d. But after Cribbins says he accepted the restraints McArthur suggested, and with McArthur\u2019s penis in Cribbin\u2019s mouth, his hands tight around his neck and his considerable weight on his chest, Cribbin claims he began sweating heavily \u2013 a signal that he had been \u201cover-drugged\u201d \u2013 and was overcome with dread. Just then, Cribbin says he heard McArthur\u2019s roommate enter the apartment \u2013 an excuse for Cribbin to end the date, dress and return home. Six months later, police reportedly approached Cribbin with a photograph of him taken from McArthur\u2019s home, showing him restrained in what investigators called \u201cthe kill position\u201d \u2013 moments from certain death. Cribbin, who is in an open relationship, says he is ashamed that he didn\u2019t tell his partner where he was going that sunny afternoon, that he survived while others died. For the first time in his life, he\u2019s afraid of the dark, and he worries the experience may turn him off sex completely. \u201cWhat if the roommate hadn\u2019t arrived home when he did?\u201d Cribbin said. \u201cI would have simply disappeared.\u201d \u2018One foot in the department and one foot in the gay community\u2019 Police may never unearth the full extent of McArthur\u2019s alleged carnage, but if it is proven in court it could be compared to the atrocities of Jeffrey Dahmer, who killed 17 boys in Milwaukee between 1978 and 1991, or John Wayne Gacy, who murdered 33 young men and boys between 1972 and 1978 in Cook County, Illinois. As the investigation deepens, police are under tremendous pressure to solve the crimes \u2013 which means trying to understand the man that investigators think is behind them. \u201c[McArthur] probably got a kick out of tricking men into believing he was harmless,\u201d says Lee, who knows that investigators are struggling to get inside McArthur\u2019s head, investigating his social circles and his online activities. Investigators will also want to understand the rituals associated with the killings and the complicated procedures involved in the disposal of his victims\u2019 remains \u2013 not least how to fit the corpses into the planters. (Many have speculated that McArthur\u2019s job as a landscaper could involve the use of equipment such as chainsaws and wood chippers.) Lee believes McArthur was probably in a perpetual search \u201cfor the next kill that would top the last one. [Serial killers] become overwhelmed by the fantasy, constantly studying the craft of killing, the details of the murder and the memory of his actions afterward \u2026 He would get a small rush every time he revisited the remains of the people he killed.\u201d How McArthur may have slipped up, or why police decided to place him under surveillance, Idsinga won\u2019t say. But, according to Lee, one thing is certain. \u201cKilling requires practice,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are seldom perfect in the beginning. Serial killers are caught when they get sloppy.\u201d But as well as getting into the head of McArthur, it means trying to heal a rift with the gay community that stretches back decades. This Sunday\u2019s otherwise jubiliant Pride parade will end with a contingent of organizers dressed in black, to pay respect to the victims of the killer and to all LGBTQ people who don\u2019t feel safe in their own community. While some in the gay community argue that this is a time for healing \u2013 and that police participation is crucial if the gay community is going to move forward \u2013 Black Lives Matter is not so eager to forgive, insisting that banning uniformed officers is a needed protest against broader police neglect and abuse. Shortly after McArthur\u2019s arrest, the mayor acknowledged that police had failed to react appropriately to the multiple disappearances, and called for an independent investigation into the department\u2019s response. Vijayanathan, who is the Honoured Grand Marshall of the Pride Parade and was the chief advocate of a third-party inquest into the investigation of the killings, is torn. He\u2019s still angry over what he calls \u201ca gross mishandling of missing person reports\u201d. But he is pleased at the mayor\u2019s response, and acknowledges that to heal, the community will have to work with police. He also expresses sympathy for the many LGBTQ members on Toronto\u2019s police force who usually enjoy marching in uniform in the Parade. Hawkes says he has witnessed the growing maturity of the department over the decades \u2013 with an emphasis placed on sensitivity training and recruiting gay officers, including an openly lesbian deputy chief. \u201cI don\u2019t want to sound like a defender of the police but I am cautiously optimistic things will get better,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause I\u2019ve seen that progress in possible.\u201d He also knows that gay and lesbian police officers are devastated that they\u2019ve been rejected by the Pride committee. \u201cThey\u2019ve got one foot in the police department and one foot in the gay community,\u201d he says. Idsinga says: \u201cI\u2019d rather see police services participate. And because of the McArthur case, I\u2019d like to participate myself.\u201d In the meantime, there are now dozens of cold cases to investigate. \u201cThis community has been victimized for years,\u201d Idsinga says. \u201cIt\u2019s our job to stop that.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 25 June 2018.

          "bodyText": "Canada\u2019s health minister was being grilled in the House of Commons over the country\u2019s plans to legalise recreational marijuana by mid-October, but it was the scene playing out behind Ginette Petitpas Taylor that catapulted the moment into headlines: one row over, during a raucous Question Period, Liberal MP Karina Gould was breastfeeding her three-month-old son. In March, Gould became Canada\u2019s first federal minister to have a baby while in office. The minister of Democratic Institutions returned to work in May with her son Oliver in tow, introducing him to her Liberal colleagues, including Justin Trudeau, the country\u2019s prime minister. Reaction to footage of her breastfeeding was swift. \u201cI\u2019m glad I live in a country where this is normal and accepted (as it should be),\u201d a reporter for the Canadian Press said on Twitter. Gould soon chimed in. \u201cNo shame in breastfeeding! Baby\u2019s gotta eat &amp; I had votes,\u201d she said on social media, adding that she was glad to have parliamentary colleagues that were supportive. Dozens responded to her tweet, many of them thanking her for blazing a trail forward. \u201cBreaking one barrier at a time. Good work Karina,\u201d noted one. \u201cThinking back to not very long ago, betting there would have a been a major meltdown over this. Glad we have matured and progressed,\u201d wrote another. Some seem surprised that a shot of Gould breastfeeding was making headlines at all. Others pointed out that the ability to strike this kind of balance between motherhood and work remains an option for a limited few in Canada. \u201cGreat to bring more attention. we just need to be aware most Canadians are not privileged this way w/ a job that provides flexibility nor do they have a national stage to make this popular.\u201d Those who chastised Gould for not covering up or stepping into her office to breastfeed were quickly rebuked online. \u201cFeeding your baby \u2018takes women backwards\u2019?

Get a grip,\u201d replied one to a criticism of the Liberal minister. In 2016, Unnur Br\u00e1 Konr\u00e1\u00f0sd\u00f3ttir, an MP with Iceland\u2019s conservative Independence party, made waves as she nursed her baby while addressing parliament about an immigration bill she had put forward. The viral video \u2013 showing Konr\u00e1\u00f0sd\u00f3ttir breastfeeding as she urged parliamentarians to support her motion to strip asylum seekers of some of their rights \u2013 led some to criticise media for choosing to focus on what a woman was doing with her body rather than what she was saying at the time.",

It contains the personal information of as many as 680,000 people believed by US authorities to be linked with terrorism, and functions effectively as a second no-fly list that is cloaked in secrecy.</p> <p>Canada\u2019s official no-fly list is called the Passenger Protect Program, which lists known and suspected terrorists who are forbidden from flying to or from Canada. One estimate concludes it has around 100,000 names, and the government has offered a redress so travellers can apply to have their name removed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/04/canada-six-year-old-no-fly-list-syed-adam-ahmed\">Father of Canadian six-year-old on no-fly list: our family is not alone</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Tuscan, however, is much larger and is managed entirely by the US government.

Originally created in 1997 as a consular aid, the list was repurposed and expanded after 9/11, and in 2016 Justin Trudeau and Barack Obama agreed to expand it still further.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The list effectively means that people cleared by the Canadian government to travel in and out of the country might still be detained because of the American list. </p> <p>It could also explain why certain travellers are searched and questioned more frequently or extensively, or why others have visas or immigration applications denied.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d0a53f4e00f184f7652bc08846955277f5a8a3f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d0a53f4e00f184f7652bc08846955277f5a8a3f9/0_0_6477_3887/1000.jpg\" alt=\"US Canada border checkpoint\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Canadian border officials can use Tuscan to request so-called \u2018derogatory information\u2019, which includes any evidence on file of the traveller\u2019s ties to terrorist activity or groups.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: William Campbell/Corbis via Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In March of 2015, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/07/13/u-s-family-suing-federal-government-after-11-hour-detention-on-canadian-border/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.f997cebd9431\">Abdisalam Wilwal</a> and his family were stopped at the Minnesota border on their return from visiting relatives in Canada. On the outbound border crossing, Canadian border guards said his file \u201cincluded a notation from US authorities that might result in US authorities questioning him more than usual when he sought to re-enter the United States,\u201d according to a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). Wilwal was detained upon returning to the US, and later released after authorities determined he had no connection to terrorism.</p> <p>Although the language used by the Canadian border guard suggests Wilwal was on Tuscan, it can be difficult to confirm given that there is no way of checking who is on the database. The names come from the US Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (Tide), which is vetted by the FBI\u2019s Terrorist Screening Center and populates various US traveller databases, as well as Canada\u2019s Tuscan and an equivalent in Australia called Tactics. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>These databases facilitate the practice of racial and ethnic profiling</p> <footer> <cite>Lex Gill, University of Toronto Citizen Lab</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Whenever a traveller crosses a Canadian land or sea border, enters the country through airport passport control, applies for a visa, or attempts to immigrate into Canada, their name is checked against the database. If there is a match, the border official can request so-called \u201cderogatory information\u201d, which includes any evidence on file of the traveller\u2019s ties to terrorist activity or groups.</p> <p>American anti-terrorism lists have frequently been accused of including names of people with no links to terrorism. In 2014, <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2014/08/05/watch-commander/\">the Intercept obtained data</a> showing that 40% of the 680,000 names in the FBI\u2019s list had no known ties to any terrorist group. Internal audits have found high error rates and incomplete records that could mix up people with similar names. </p> <p>The ACLU has challenged the constitutionality of databases such as Tide, contending the process for being added to these lists is vague, the effects can be severe and the databases are prone to errors. <strong>\u201c</strong>Non-citizens can even be watchlisted based on innocent associations with others who are watchlisted,\u201d said Hugh Handeyside, a senior staff attorney at the ACLU.</p> <p>Databases such as Tuscan pose \u201csignifcant civil liberties concerns,\u201d said Lex Gill, a research fellow at the <a href=\"https://citizenlab.ca/\">University of Toronto Citizen Lab</a>.

          "bodyText": "Canadian border guards have been screening travellers using a huge, secretive US anti-terrorism database that is almost never referred to publicly, new documents reveal. The database, called Tuscan, is provided to every Canadian border guard and immigration officer, and empowers them to detain, interrogate, arrest and deny entry to anyone found on it. Hundreds of pages of documents obtained by the Guardian through Canada\u2019s access to information system reveal the fullest picture yet of a database that, although employed in Canada, is maintained exclusively by the US. It contains the personal information of as many as 680,000 people believed by US authorities to be linked with terrorism, and functions effectively as a second no-fly list that is cloaked in secrecy. Canada\u2019s official no-fly list is called the Passenger Protect Program, which lists known and suspected terrorists who are forbidden from flying to or from Canada. One estimate concludes it has around 100,000 names, and the government has offered a redress so travellers can apply to have their name removed. Tuscan, however, is much larger and is managed entirely by the US government. There is no clear process in Canada to have your name removed from the list \u2013 nor would the US be required to oblige. What\u2019s more, while Canada\u2019s no-fly list only applies to airports, Tuscan extends to every land and sea border in Canada, as well as visa and immigration applications. Ottawa has never formally recognised the scope of Tuscan, although it is forging ahead with a closely guarded plan to expand and update it. Originally created in 1997 as a consular aid, the list was repurposed and expanded after 9/11, and in 2016 Justin Trudeau and Barack Obama agreed to expand it still further. The list effectively means that people cleared by the Canadian government to travel in and out of the country might still be detained because of the American list. It could also explain why certain travellers are searched and questioned more frequently or extensively, or why others have visas or immigration applications denied. In March of 2015, Abdisalam Wilwal and his family were stopped at the Minnesota border on their return from visiting relatives in Canada. On the outbound border crossing, Canadian border guards said his file \u201cincluded a notation from US authorities that might result in US authorities questioning him more than usual when he sought to re-enter the United States,\u201d according to a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). Wilwal was detained upon returning to the US, and later released after authorities determined he had no connection to terrorism. Although the language used by the Canadian border guard suggests Wilwal was on Tuscan, it can be difficult to confirm given that there is no way of checking who is on the database. The names come from the US Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (Tide), which is vetted by the FBI\u2019s Terrorist Screening Center and populates various US traveller databases, as well as Canada\u2019s Tuscan and an equivalent in Australia called Tactics. Whenever a traveller crosses a Canadian land or sea border, enters the country through airport passport control, applies for a visa, or attempts to immigrate into Canada, their name is checked against the database. If there is a match, the border official can request so-called \u201cderogatory information\u201d, which includes any evidence on file of the traveller\u2019s ties to terrorist activity or groups. American anti-terrorism lists have frequently been accused of including names of people with no links to terrorism. In 2014, the Intercept obtained data showing that 40% of the 680,000 names in the FBI\u2019s list had no known ties to any terrorist group. Internal audits have found high error rates and incomplete records that could mix up people with similar names. The ACLU has challenged the constitutionality of databases such as Tide, contending the process for being added to these lists is vague, the effects can be severe and the databases are prone to errors. \u201cNon-citizens can even be watchlisted based on innocent associations with others who are watchlisted,\u201d said Hugh Handeyside, a senior staff attorney at the ACLU. Databases such as Tuscan pose \u201csignifcant civil liberties concerns,\u201d said Lex Gill, a research fellow at the University of Toronto Citizen Lab. Legal and human rights experts, she notes, have \u201cconsistently raised the issue of false positives, as well as the risk that these databases facilitate the practice of racial and ethnic profiling, which has particularly acute impacts for those of Muslim and Arab descent\u201d. Canada\u2019s own official no-fly list has come under intense scrutiny after children as young as three were listed. But whereas Ottawa has trumpeted a program to help travellers get their names removed from that no-fly list, Tuscan offers no such obvious redress. In fact, Tuscan \u2013 which stands for Tipoff US/Canada \u2013 is mentioned almost nowhere in Canadian government documents except an obscure 2005 Citizenship and Immigration Canada report [pdf], where it is described as a way for both governments to \u201cshare data in order to deny entry to foreign terrorists who may attempt to travel to Canada and/or the United States\u201d. There is a similarly passing reference [8.6MB pdf] in a commission of inquiry from 2006 into the detention of Canadian citizen Maher Arar, who was flown to Syria and tortured. Despite this, Ottawa is forging ahead with an update to the system. The briefing notes obtained by the Guardian, prepared for Ralph Goodale, Canada\u2019s public safety minister, reveal the Canadian government has worked for the past three years to expand its involvement in Tuscan, without public acknowledgment or public consultation. A spokesperson for Public Safety Canada confirmed that Tuscan is provided to all Canadian border and immigration officials \u201cfor the purpose of guiding decisions on admissibility to Canada\u201d. The spokesperson said that, while an agreement was signed in June 2016 to expand and modernize the program, negotiations were ongoing between the two countries to finalize the details. When asked what Ottawa is doing to ensure that the database is accurate, and to ensure that innocent travellers aren\u2019t caught up in the database, the spokesperson said: \u201cProcedures have been introduced to allow for the consideration of exculpatory and clarifying information, as well as to update and correct information when errors are detected. Protocols also exist around the use and protection of information.\u201d The spokesperson refused to confirm the number of names on Tuscan, citing \u201coperational reasons\u201d.",

Trudeau expected that the end of 95 years of prohibition would immediately begin to curtail the estimated C$6bn ($4.5bn) in profits pouring into the black market. \u201cAnd over the following months, and indeed years, we will almost completely replace the organised crime market on that,\u201d he said. Initially the federal government had hoped to launch retail sales by July this year. Trudeau said: \u201cOne of the things that we heard very clearly from the provinces is that they need a certain amount of time to get their bricks-and-mortar stores and their online sales ready. \u201cProducers need time to be able to actually prepare for a regimented and successful implementation of the regime ... This is something that we want to get right.\u201d Once legalisation goes into effect, Canadians will be able grow up to four plants in their home and carry up to 30 grams of dried cannabis for personal use. They\u2019ll be able to prepare edibles at home for personal use and share up to 30 grams between adults. Those caught with more than this amount, or who supply marijuana to minors, will face stiff penalties. Sales of cannabis will vary widely across the country. In Alberta, recreational cannabis will be available at more than 200 private retailers while in New Brunswick, the provincial government will operate a chain of stores called Cannabis NB. Many questions remained unanswered, however, such as how police will test motorists suspected of driving under the influence, whether provinces will be able to ban home cultivation and how legalisation will interact with the roughly 400,000 people a day who cross the US-Canada border. The federal government is also under renewed pressure to pair legalisation with pardons for the hundreds of thousands of Canadians with prior marijuana convictions. On Wednesday Trudeau said it would be \u201cillogical\u201d to consider the issue before the new law comes into effect. \u201cWe\u2019ve said that we will look at next steps once the coming-into-force happens but between now and then the current regime stays.\u201d",
