          "body": "<h2><strong>We need radical change</strong><br></h2> <p>After reading A world divided <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/25/2016-was-the-end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it-so-whats-next\" title=\"\">(16&#xa0;December)</a>, one can only say, \u201cDon\u2019t blame Donald\u201d. He may be a sort of human gum boil, but electoral choices are only a symptom of deeper deficiencies. When people across the world vote the wrong way it is blamed on populism and post-truth \u2013 apparently if the poor really understood politics they would vote for a status quo that continues to see them suffer a loss of income and jobs, the dismantling of social services and grotesque overcrowding.</p> <p>Globalisation has removed many restrictions on the movement of labour, allowing wages to be forced down; as national consciousness is lost, environmental protections are diminished and vast multinational corporations are becoming de facto governments. Income inequality is a major issue across the western world, but the greatest threat of all was barely mentioned in this edition: climate change.</p> <p>The brutal realities are that capitalism doesn\u2019t work, globalisation equals exploitation, and virtually nothing is being done to address the underlying problems that are making whole countries almost uninhabitable. The people have realised that millions of unfortunate refugees are on a one-way ticket out their own homelands and will take jobs, housing and space.</p> <p>Unless we all become activists, the next 20 years will see vast numbers of people crammed into the diminishing temperate zones of the world, consuming our resource base. The best of your Christmas edition was a comment on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/dec/13/guardian-weekly-letters-castro-energy-hubris\" title=\"\">Reply page</a>: \u201cIt is a radical change in our behaviour that is required\u201d. The challenge is to create a post-combustion society.<br><strong>Philippa Morris</strong><br>Gravesend, NSW, Australia</p> <p>\u2022 George Monbiot says that, given the bankruptcy of our political systems, \u201cwe must rethink the world from first principles\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/13/despair-mess-commons-transform-society\" title=\"\">(30 December)</a>. If we are serious about this, then we must cease looking for them among the plethora of issues that confront us and turn our attention instead to something far more radical.</p> <p>Surely the Russian philosopher Nikolai Berdyaev was nearer the mark when he insisted that only personality \u2013 the highest spiritual value \u2013 is capable of solving social problems. This highest spiritual value is to be found in the depths of our own subjectivity \u2013 and nowhere else. It is a deepest inwardness that reaches out towards others and is in continual communion with them.</p> <p>Failing a breakthrough to this highest value, it is all too lamentably predictable that our social problems will only go on getting worse. The time has come when nothing less than real first principles will do. No more bogus ersatz versions of what it is to be human. We are deep, infinitely deep. And we have to bring ourselves in all our spiritual inwardness to the outer questions that press upon us and menace us.<br><strong>A David</strong><br>Castlemaine, Victoria, Australia</p> <h2><strong>Climate change is key threat</strong><br></h2> <p>It is indeed hard to be an optimist, but there are other possible grounds for hope about global warming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/dec/19/arctic-ice-melt-already-affecting-weather-patterns-where-you-live-right-now\" title=\"\">(30&#xa0;December)</a>. This is our greatest danger but also a challenge that confronts the whole globe, that is caused by all humanity and whose mitigation needs the cooperative efforts of everyone. There is some evidence that a growing awareness of this is beginning to counter the national and ethnic mistrust, prejudice and disintegration that is also increasingly afflicting global society.</p> <p>In 2015 America and China agreed to act together on climate threats, despite their growing conflict in the South China Sea. They combined with many other countries to pass the unprecedented (if still inadequate) Paris climate accords. In November 2016, in Morocco, this agreement was ratified by over 100 countries and signatories also confirmed that their commitment would continue, even if the US were to withdraw.</p> <p>As the catastrophic effects of climate change become increasingly evident, might we feel some hope that global cooperation might counteract conflict and hatred? <br><strong>Constance Lever-Tracy</strong><br>Adelaide, South Australia</p> <p>\u2022 The cataclysmic damage to the Arctic ecosystem described by Damian Carrington should logically lead to a hard scientific examination of the bizarre primate responsible. Time magazine\u2019s selection for their Person of the Year, ie our species\u2019 most influential member, is a US tycoon who has all but renounced sapience, while the leading runner-up is known as a murderous, multi-billionaire political despot. Both are prominent for regarding nature as little more than an opponent to be conquered. As it does in our incredibly vicious intra-specific conflicts, our conflicts with nature seem to bring out the most childish and irrational selfishness in us.<br><strong>John Hayward</strong><br>Weegena, Tasmania, Australia</p> <h2><strong>The perils of complexity</strong><br></h2> <p>John Harris\u2019s article on the perils of complexity <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/29/trump-brexit-society-complex-people-populists\" title=\"\">(6 January)</a> is a little too complex. While I agree that we see in the Brexit vote and in Donald Trump\u2019s ascendancy a rejection of globalisation, it is drawing too long a bow to interpret this as an indication of the end of civilisation. The clear message from both events is: the system\u2019s broke, let\u2019s just smash it. With the first part I agree: the second is sheer Luddism, but without the redeeming virtue of that movement \u2013 a belief in a better, more equal society.</p> <p>Harris is accurate in his assessment of Tainter\u2019s book, The Collapse of Complex Societies. The parallels are evident.

          "bodyText": "We need radical change After reading A world divided (16 December), one can only say, \u201cDon\u2019t blame Donald\u201d. He may be a sort of human gum boil, but electoral choices are only a symptom of deeper deficiencies. When people across the world vote the wrong way it is blamed on populism and post-truth \u2013 apparently if the poor really understood politics they would vote for a status quo that continues to see them suffer a loss of income and jobs, the dismantling of social services and grotesque overcrowding. Globalisation has removed many restrictions on the movement of labour, allowing wages to be forced down; as national consciousness is lost, environmental protections are diminished and vast multinational corporations are becoming de facto governments. Income inequality is a major issue across the western world, but the greatest threat of all was barely mentioned in this edition: climate change. The brutal realities are that capitalism doesn\u2019t work, globalisation equals exploitation, and virtually nothing is being done to address the underlying problems that are making whole countries almost uninhabitable. The people have realised that millions of unfortunate refugees are on a one-way ticket out their own homelands and will take jobs, housing and space. Unless we all become activists, the next 20 years will see vast numbers of people crammed into the diminishing temperate zones of the world, consuming our resource base. The best of your Christmas edition was a comment on the Reply page: \u201cIt is a radical change in our behaviour that is required\u201d. The challenge is to create a post-combustion society. Philippa Morris Gravesend, NSW, Australia \u2022 George Monbiot says that, given the bankruptcy of our political systems, \u201cwe must rethink the world from first principles\u201d (30 December). If we are serious about this, then we must cease looking for them among the plethora of issues that confront us and turn our attention instead to something far more radical. Surely the Russian philosopher Nikolai Berdyaev was nearer the mark when he insisted that only personality \u2013 the highest spiritual value \u2013 is capable of solving social problems. This highest spiritual value is to be found in the depths of our own subjectivity \u2013 and nowhere else. It is a deepest inwardness that reaches out towards others and is in continual communion with them. Failing a breakthrough to this highest value, it is all too lamentably predictable that our social problems will only go on getting worse. The time has come when nothing less than real first principles will do. No more bogus ersatz versions of what it is to be human. We are deep, infinitely deep. And we have to bring ourselves in all our spiritual inwardness to the outer questions that press upon us and menace us. A David Castlemaine, Victoria, Australia Climate change is key threat It is indeed hard to be an optimist, but there are other possible grounds for hope about global warming (30 December). This is our greatest danger but also a challenge that confronts the whole globe, that is caused by all humanity and whose mitigation needs the cooperative efforts of everyone. There is some evidence that a growing awareness of this is beginning to counter the national and ethnic mistrust, prejudice and disintegration that is also increasingly afflicting global society. In 2015 America and China agreed to act together on climate threats, despite their growing conflict in the South China Sea. They combined with many other countries to pass the unprecedented (if still inadequate) Paris climate accords. In November 2016, in Morocco, this agreement was ratified by over 100 countries and signatories also confirmed that their commitment would continue, even if the US were to withdraw. As the catastrophic effects of climate change become increasingly evident, might we feel some hope that global cooperation might counteract conflict and hatred? Constance Lever-Tracy Adelaide, South Australia \u2022 The cataclysmic damage to the Arctic ecosystem described by Damian Carrington should logically lead to a hard scientific examination of the bizarre primate responsible. Time magazine\u2019s selection for their Person of the Year, ie our species\u2019 most influential member, is a US tycoon who has all but renounced sapience, while the leading runner-up is known as a murderous, multi-billionaire political despot. Both are prominent for regarding nature as little more than an opponent to be conquered. As it does in our incredibly vicious intra-specific conflicts, our conflicts with nature seem to bring out the most childish and irrational selfishness in us. John Hayward Weegena, Tasmania, Australia The perils of complexity John Harris\u2019s article on the perils of complexity (6 January) is a little too complex. While I agree that we see in the Brexit vote and in Donald Trump\u2019s ascendancy a rejection of globalisation, it is drawing too long a bow to interpret this as an indication of the end of civilisation. The clear message from both events is: the system\u2019s broke, let\u2019s just smash it. With the first part I agree: the second is sheer Luddism, but without the redeeming virtue of that movement \u2013 a belief in a better, more equal society. Harris is accurate in his assessment of Tainter\u2019s book, The Collapse of Complex Societies. The parallels are evident. But that is where the comparisons come up against one irrefutable fact: the globalisation of data that has the potential to transform not just our own particular version of civilisation but the mindset of everyone concerned. Civilisation, as Gandhi is reputed to have said, would be a good idea: let\u2019s try for a multi-faceted global version rather than writing off the entire concept just because we\u2019ve failed to get it quite right. Noel Bird Boreen Point, Queensland, Australia Trudeau\u2019s pretty words So Justin Trudeau is proud that he is able to both \u201cget\u201d and to allay people\u2019s fears about globalisation (30 December). But what has he actually done? He may have lessened fear. But has he solved the problem? As far as I can see, with the signing of Ceta and with the expansion of tar-sand operations, Trudeau is going \u201cfull out\u201d for free-trade and for the most environmentally damaging form of globalisation.

Or sweet-talkers like Trudeau who dress free-market dogma up in pretty words? I don\u2019t know which is worse. Alan Mitcham Cologne, Germany Trump\u2019s effective lies Jonathan Freedland is undoubtedly correct about Trump being a \u201cserial, if not compulsive liar\u201d (16 December). Unfortunately the most dangerous liars are the most articulate ones. Added to that is the extraordinary situation where Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin has been able to establish a deranged Republican as a puppet president for the United States. Americans are also going to have to come to terms with how this occurred in spite of the fact that nearly 3 million more people voted for the Democrat than for the Republican. Peter Hornsby Mitcham, South Australia Briefly \u2022 Our older son, who turns 40 this year, had his own word for hygge (9 December) when he was about eight years old: \u201ccornery\u201d (as in sitting cosily in a corner).

          "body": "<p>As 2017 begins, Canada may be the last immigrant nation left standing. Our government believes in the value of immigration, as does the majority of the population. We took in an estimated 300,000 newcomers in 2016, including 48,000 refugees, and we want them to become citizens; around 85% of permanent residents eventually do. Recently there have been concerns about bringing in single Arab men, but otherwise Canada welcomes people from all faiths and corners. The greater Toronto area is now the most diverse city on the planet, with half its residents born outside the country; Vancouver, Calgary, Ottawa and Montreal aren\u2019t far behind. Annual immigration accounts for roughly 1% of the country\u2019s current population of 36 million.</p> <p>Canada has been over-praised lately for, in effect, going about our business as usual. In 2016 such luminaries as US President Barack Obama and Bono, no less, declared \u201cthe world needs more Canada\u201d. In October, the Economist blared \u201cLiberty Moves North: Canada\u2019s Example to the World\u201d on its cover, illustrated by the Statue of Liberty haloed in a maple leaf and wielding a hockey stick. Infamously, on the night of the US election Canada\u2019s official immigration website crashed, apparently due to the volume of traffic.</p> <p>Of course, 2016 was also the year \u2013 really the second running \u2013 when many western countries turned angrily against immigration, blaming it for a variety of ills in what journalist Doug Saunders calls the \u201cglobal reflex appeal to fear\u201d. Alongside the rise of nativism has emerged a new nationalism that can scarcely be bothered to deny its roots in racial identities and exclusionary narratives.</p> <p>Compared to such hard stances, Canada\u2019s almost cheerful commitment to inclusion might at first appear almost naive. It isn\u2019t. There are practical reasons for keeping the doors open. Starting in the 1990s, low fertility and an aging population began slowing Canada\u2019s natural growth rate. Ten years ago, two-thirds of population increase was courtesy of immigration. By 2030, it is projected to be 100%.</p> <p>The economic benefits are also self-evident, especially if full citizenship is the agreed goal. All that \u201csettlers\u201d \u2013 ie, Canadians who are not indigenous to the land \u2013 need do is look in the mirror to recognize the generally happy ending of an immigrant saga. Our government repeats it, our statistics confirm it, our own eyes and ears register it: diversity fuels, not undermines, prosperity. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Telling an Italian or French citizen they lack a \u201ccore identity\u201d may not be the best vote-winning strategy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But as well as practical considerations for remaining an immigrant country, Canadians, by and large, are also philosophically predisposed to an openness that others find bewildering, even reckless. The prime minister, Justin Trudeau, articulated this when he told the New York Times Magazine that Canada could be the \u201cfirst postnational state\u201d. He added: \u201cThere is no core identity, no mainstream in Canada.\u201d </p> <p>The remark, made in October 2015, failed to cause a ripple \u2013 but when I mentioned it to Michael Bach, Germany\u2019s minister for European affairs, who was touring Canada to learn more about integration, he was astounded. No European politician could say such a thing, he said. The thought was too radical. </p> <p>For a European, of course, the nation-state model remains sacrosanct, never mind how ill-suited it may be to an era of dissolving borders and widespread exodus. The modern state \u2013 loosely defined by a more or less coherent racial and religious group, ruled by internal laws and guarded by a national army \u2013 took shape in Europe. Telling an Italian or French citizen they lack a \u201ccore identity\u201d may not be the best vote-winning strategy.</p> <p>To Canadians, in contrast, the remark was unexceptional. After all, one of the country\u2019s greatest authors, Mavis Gallant, once defined a Canadian as \u201csomeone with a logical reason to think he may be one\u201d \u2013 not exactly a ringing assertion of a national character type. Trudeau could, in fact, have been voicing a chronic anxiety among Canadians: the absence of a shared identity.</p> <p>But he wasn\u2019t. He was outlining, however obliquely, a governing principle about Canada in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. We don\u2019t talk about ourselves in this manner often, and don\u2019t yet have the vocabulary to make our case well enough. Even so, the principle feels right. Odd as it may seem, Canada may finally be owning our postnationalism.</p> <p>There\u2019s more than one story in all this. First and foremost, postnationalism is a frame to understand our ongoing experiment in filling a vast yet unified geographic space with the diversity of the world. It is also a half-century old intellectual project, born of the country\u2019s awakening from colonial slumber. But postnationalism has also been in intermittent practise for centuries, since long before the nation-state of Canada was formalised in 1867. In some sense, we have always been thinking differently about this continent-wide landmass, using ideas borrowed from Indigenous societies. From the moment Europeans began arriving in North America they were made welcome by the locals, taught how to survive and thrive amid multiple identities and allegiances.</p> <p>That welcome was often betrayed, in particular during the late 19<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> centuries, when settler Canada did profound harm to Indigenous people. But, if the imbalance remains, so too does the influence: the model of another way of belonging. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"158e7a067d735a5824c0bc72ff3c576bf40796e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/158e7a067d735a5824c0bc72ff3c576bf40796e0/0_0_3582_2338/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mavis Gallant once defined a Canadian as \u2018someone with a logical reason to think he may be one\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"653\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mavis Gallant once defined a Canadian as \u2018someone with a logical reason to think he may be one\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Jacqui Oakley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Can any nation truly behave \u201cpostnationally\u201d \u2013 ie without falling back on the established mechanisms of state governance and control? The simple answer is no. </p> <p>Canada has borders, where guards check passports, and an army. It asserts the occasional modest territorial claim. Trudeau is more aware than most of these mechanisms: he oversees them. </p> <p>It can also be argued that Canada enjoys the luxury of thinking outside the nation-state box courtesy of its behemoth neighbour to the south. The state needn\u2019t defend its borders too forcefully or make that army too large, and Canada\u2019s economic prosperity may be as straightforward as continuing to do 75% of its trade with the US. Being liberated, the thinking goes, from the economic and military stresses that most other countries face gives Canada the breathing room, and the confidence, to experiment with more radical approaches to society. Lucky us.</p> <p>Nor is there uniform agreement within Canada about being post-anything. When the novelist Yann Martel casually described his homeland as \u201cthe greatest hotel on earth,\u201d he meant it as a compliment \u2013 but some read it as an endorsement of newcomers deciding to view Canada as a convenient waystation: a security, business or real-estate opportunity, with no lasting responsibilities attached.</p> <p>Likewise, plenty of Canadians believe we possess a set of normative values, and want newcomers to prove they abide by them. Kellie Leitch, who is running for the leadership of the Conservative party, suggested last autumn that we screen potential immigrants for \u201canti-Canadian values.\u201d A minister in the previous Conservative government, Chris Alexander, pledged in 2015 to set up a tip-line for citizens to report \u201cbarbaric cultural practises\u201d. And in the last election, the outgoing prime minister, Stephen Harper, tried in vain to hamstring Trudeau\u2019s popularity by confecting a debate about the hijab.</p> <p>To add to the mix, the French-speaking province of Quebec already constitutes one distinctive nation, as do the 50-plus First Nations spread across the country. All have their own perspectives and priorities, and may or may not be interested in a postnational frame. (That said, Trudeau is a bilingual Montrealer, and Quebec a vibrantly diverse society.)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Can any nation truly behave 'postnationally' \u2013 ie without state governance and control? The simple answer is no</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In short, the nation-state of Canada, while wrapped in less bunting than other global versions, is still recognisable. But postnational thought is less about hand-holding in circles and shredding passports. It\u2019s about the use of a different lens to examine the challenges and precepts of an entire politics, economy and society.</p> <p>Though sovereign since 1867, Canada lingered in the shadow of the British empire for nearly a century. Not until the 1960s did we fly our own flag and sing our own anthem, and not until 1982 did Trudeau\u2019s father, Pierre, patriate the constitution from the UK, adding a charter of rights. He also introduced multiculturalism as official national policy. The challenge, then, might have seemed to define a national identity to match. </p> <p>This was never going to be easy, given our colonial hangover and American cultural influence. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan\">Marshall McLuhan</a>, one of the last century\u2019s most seismic thinkers, felt we shouldn\u2019t bother. \u201cCanada is the only country in the world that knows how to live without an identity,\u201d he said in 1963. </p> <p>According to poet and scholar BW Powe, McLuhan saw in Canada the raw materials for a dynamic new conception of nationhood, one unshackled from the state\u2019s \u201cdemarcated borderlines and walls, its connection to blood and soil,\u201d its obsession with \u201ccohesion based on a melting pot, on nativist fervor, the idea of the promised land\u201d. Instead, the weakness of the established Canadian identity encouraged a plurality of them \u2013 not to mention a healthy flexibility and receptivity to change. Once Canada moved away from privileging denizens of the former empire to practising multiculturalism, it could become a place where \u201cmany faiths and histories and visions\u201d would co-exist. <br></p> <p>That\u2019s exactly what happened.

          "bodyText": "As 2017 begins, Canada may be the last immigrant nation left standing. Our government believes in the value of immigration, as does the majority of the population. We took in an estimated 300,000 newcomers in 2016, including 48,000 refugees, and we want them to become citizens; around 85% of permanent residents eventually do. Recently there have been concerns about bringing in single Arab men, but otherwise Canada welcomes people from all faiths and corners. The greater Toronto area is now the most diverse city on the planet, with half its residents born outside the country; Vancouver, Calgary, Ottawa and Montreal aren\u2019t far behind. Annual immigration accounts for roughly 1% of the country\u2019s current population of 36 million. Canada has been over-praised lately for, in effect, going about our business as usual. In 2016 such luminaries as US President Barack Obama and Bono, no less, declared \u201cthe world needs more Canada\u201d. In October, the Economist blared \u201cLiberty Moves North: Canada\u2019s Example to the World\u201d on its cover, illustrated by the Statue of Liberty haloed in a maple leaf and wielding a hockey stick. Infamously, on the night of the US election Canada\u2019s official immigration website crashed, apparently due to the volume of traffic. Of course, 2016 was also the year \u2013 really the second running \u2013 when many western countries turned angrily against immigration, blaming it for a variety of ills in what journalist Doug Saunders calls the \u201cglobal reflex appeal to fear\u201d. Alongside the rise of nativism has emerged a new nationalism that can scarcely be bothered to deny its roots in racial identities and exclusionary narratives. Compared to such hard stances, Canada\u2019s almost cheerful commitment to inclusion might at first appear almost naive. It isn\u2019t. There are practical reasons for keeping the doors open. Starting in the 1990s, low fertility and an aging population began slowing Canada\u2019s natural growth rate. Ten years ago, two-thirds of population increase was courtesy of immigration. By 2030, it is projected to be 100%. The economic benefits are also self-evident, especially if full citizenship is the agreed goal. All that \u201csettlers\u201d \u2013 ie, Canadians who are not indigenous to the land \u2013 need do is look in the mirror to recognize the generally happy ending of an immigrant saga. Our government repeats it, our statistics confirm it, our own eyes and ears register it: diversity fuels, not undermines, prosperity. But as well as practical considerations for remaining an immigrant country, Canadians, by and large, are also philosophically predisposed to an openness that others find bewildering, even reckless. The prime minister, Justin Trudeau, articulated this when he told the New York Times Magazine that Canada could be the \u201cfirst postnational state\u201d. He added: \u201cThere is no core identity, no mainstream in Canada.\u201d The remark, made in October 2015, failed to cause a ripple \u2013 but when I mentioned it to Michael Bach, Germany\u2019s minister for European affairs, who was touring Canada to learn more about integration, he was astounded. No European politician could say such a thing, he said. The thought was too radical. For a European, of course, the nation-state model remains sacrosanct, never mind how ill-suited it may be to an era of dissolving borders and widespread exodus. The modern state \u2013 loosely defined by a more or less coherent racial and religious group, ruled by internal laws and guarded by a national army \u2013 took shape in Europe. Telling an Italian or French citizen they lack a \u201ccore identity\u201d may not be the best vote-winning strategy. To Canadians, in contrast, the remark was unexceptional. After all, one of the country\u2019s greatest authors, Mavis Gallant, once defined a Canadian as \u201csomeone with a logical reason to think he may be one\u201d \u2013 not exactly a ringing assertion of a national character type. Trudeau could, in fact, have been voicing a chronic anxiety among Canadians: the absence of a shared identity. But he wasn\u2019t. He was outlining, however obliquely, a governing principle about Canada in the 21st century. We don\u2019t talk about ourselves in this manner often, and don\u2019t yet have the vocabulary to make our case well enough. Even so, the principle feels right. Odd as it may seem, Canada may finally be owning our postnationalism. There\u2019s more than one story in all this. First and foremost, postnationalism is a frame to understand our ongoing experiment in filling a vast yet unified geographic space with the diversity of the world. It is also a half-century old intellectual project, born of the country\u2019s awakening from colonial slumber. But postnationalism has also been in intermittent practise for centuries, since long before the nation-state of Canada was formalised in 1867. In some sense, we have always been thinking differently about this continent-wide landmass, using ideas borrowed from Indigenous societies. From the moment Europeans began arriving in North America they were made welcome by the locals, taught how to survive and thrive amid multiple identities and allegiances. That welcome was often betrayed, in particular during the late 19th and 20th centuries, when settler Canada did profound harm to Indigenous people. But, if the imbalance remains, so too does the influence: the model of another way of belonging. Can any nation truly behave \u201cpostnationally\u201d \u2013 ie without falling back on the established mechanisms of state governance and control? The simple answer is no. Canada has borders, where guards check passports, and an army. It asserts the occasional modest territorial claim. Trudeau is more aware than most of these mechanisms: he oversees them. It can also be argued that Canada enjoys the luxury of thinking outside the nation-state box courtesy of its behemoth neighbour to the south. The state needn\u2019t defend its borders too forcefully or make that army too large, and Canada\u2019s economic prosperity may be as straightforward as continuing to do 75% of its trade with the US. Being liberated, the thinking goes, from the economic and military stresses that most other countries face gives Canada the breathing room, and the confidence, to experiment with more radical approaches to society. Lucky us. Nor is there uniform agreement within Canada about being post-anything. When the novelist Yann Martel casually described his homeland as \u201cthe greatest hotel on earth,\u201d he meant it as a compliment \u2013 but some read it as an endorsement of newcomers deciding to view Canada as a convenient waystation: a security, business or real-estate opportunity, with no lasting responsibilities attached. Likewise, plenty of Canadians believe we possess a set of normative values, and want newcomers to prove they abide by them. Kellie Leitch, who is running for the leadership of the Conservative party, suggested last autumn that we screen potential immigrants for \u201canti-Canadian values.\u201d A minister in the previous Conservative government, Chris Alexander, pledged in 2015 to set up a tip-line for citizens to report \u201cbarbaric cultural practises\u201d. And in the last election, the outgoing prime minister, Stephen Harper, tried in vain to hamstring Trudeau\u2019s popularity by confecting a debate about the hijab. To add to the mix, the French-speaking province of Quebec already constitutes one distinctive nation, as do the 50-plus First Nations spread across the country. All have their own perspectives and priorities, and may or may not be interested in a postnational frame. (That said, Trudeau is a bilingual Montrealer, and Quebec a vibrantly diverse society.) In short, the nation-state of Canada, while wrapped in less bunting than other global versions, is still recognisable. But postnational thought is less about hand-holding in circles and shredding passports. It\u2019s about the use of a different lens to examine the challenges and precepts of an entire politics, economy and society. Though sovereign since 1867, Canada lingered in the shadow of the British empire for nearly a century. Not until the 1960s did we fly our own flag and sing our own anthem, and not until 1982 did Trudeau\u2019s father, Pierre, patriate the constitution from the UK, adding a charter of rights. He also introduced multiculturalism as official national policy. The challenge, then, might have seemed to define a national identity to match. This was never going to be easy, given our colonial hangover and American cultural influence. Marshall McLuhan, one of the last century\u2019s most seismic thinkers, felt we shouldn\u2019t bother. \u201cCanada is the only country in the world that knows how to live without an identity,\u201d he said in 1963. According to poet and scholar BW Powe, McLuhan saw in Canada the raw materials for a dynamic new conception of nationhood, one unshackled from the state\u2019s \u201cdemarcated borderlines and walls, its connection to blood and soil,\u201d its obsession with \u201ccohesion based on a melting pot, on nativist fervor, the idea of the promised land\u201d. Instead, the weakness of the established Canadian identity encouraged a plurality of them \u2013 not to mention a healthy flexibility and receptivity to change. Once Canada moved away from privileging denizens of the former empire to practising multiculturalism, it could become a place where \u201cmany faiths and histories and visions\u201d would co-exist. That\u2019s exactly what happened. If McLuhan didn\u2019t see how Chinese, Japanese, Ukrainian and later Italian, Greek and Eastern European arrivals underpinned the growth of Canada in that sleepy first century, he surely registered before his death in 1980 the positive impact of successive waves of South Asians, Vietnamese and Caribbean immigrants. The last several decades have been marked by an increasingly deep diversity, particularly featuring mainland Chinese, Indians and Filipinos. Others have expanded on McLuhan\u2019s insight. The writer and essayist John Ralston Saul (co-founder of the charity for which I work) calls Canada a \u201crevolutionary reversal of the standard nation-state myth\u201d, and ascribes much of our radical capacity \u2013 not a term you often hear applied to Canadians \u2013 to our application of the Indigenous concept of welcome. \u201cSpace for multiple identities and multiple loyalties,\u201d he says of these philosophies, the roots of which go deep in North American soil, \u201cfor an idea of belonging which is comfortable with contradictions.\u201d How unique is any of this? Ralston Saul argues that Canada\u2019s experiment is \u201cperpetually incomplete\u201d. In other countries, a sovereignty movement like Quebec\u2019s might have led to bloodshed. Instead, aside from a brief period of violent separatist agitation culminating in kidnappings and a murder in 1970, Canada and Quebec have been in constant compromise mode, arguing at the ballot box and finding ways to accommodate. Canada\u2019s incomplete identity is, in this sense, a positive, a spur to move forward without spilling blood, to keep thinking and evolving \u2013 perhaps, in the end, simply to respond to newness without fear.

Our staff are already working extremely hard but this does mean that for certain emergencies, some patients can expect to wait longer for an ambulance as we focus our efforts on responding to calls which are deemed life-threatening.\u201d</p> <p>During the festive period, Secamb saw a 10% rise in demand compared to last year. From 7pm on Christmas Eve to 11pm on Boxing Day it responded to 4,840 emergency calls. </p> <p>Last year, between 10pm on New Year\u2019s Eve and 4am on 1 January, the trust handled 1,135 calls \u2013 an average of more than three 999 calls a minute \u2013 and this year is expected to be even higher. </p> <p>Webber urged people to only dial 999 in a \u201cserious emergency\u201d and asked them to consider other options, including the NHS 111 service. </p> <p>Partly in response to high call levels, it emerged this week that Secamb\u2019s specialist critical care paramedics are being brought into the overall cover plan system to make them available to respond to all types of call. </p> <p>The change, revealed in a leaked memo, provoked criticism among CCPs who fear lives could be endangered by them being tied up with non-urgent calls instead of dealing with life-threatening emergencies as they have done previously. </p> <p>Secamb managers have defended the move, saying that with high demand and poor response times it could not continue the current model of not sending CCPs to certain categories of patient. </p> <p>The change will run until the end of March 2017 when it will be reviewed. </p> <p>Secamb, which covers Kent, Surrey, Sussex and north-east Hampshire, was put into special measures in September after the Care Quality Commission ranked it inadequate. The change is part of its recovery plan.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-12-31T17:37:23.193Z\">at 5.37pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5867e377e4b08d2df8a6d2dc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-31T17:02:22.537Z\">5.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Fears that selfie sticks would become pass\u00e9 in 2017 appear totally unfounded as new year partygoers in Hong Kong capture the turn of the year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3ad91f58570f706c7071c086fcf1b1b409714ad3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ad91f58570f706c7071c086fcf1b1b409714ad3/0_137_4096_2459/1000.jpg\" alt=\"New Year\u2019s Eve celebration in Hong Kong\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New Year\u2019s Eve celebration in Hong Kong.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jerome Favre/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-12-31T17:05:47.226Z\">at 5.05pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5867df6ae4b0a43edaa1ff99\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-31T16:49:41.075Z\">4.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Swedes see in 1 January with a ny\u00e5rst\u00e5rta, or new year\u2019s cake.

President elect, Donald Trump, has arrived at the same place he always celebrates New Year. At a star-studded party at the Mar-a-lago resort, which he owns, on Palm Beach. Tickets cost $575 for guests, and $525 for members. According to Vanity Fair, Trump\u2019s attendance has raised questions of a potential conflict of interest, with critics concerned the event could be perceived as selling access to the president-elect. Incoming White House Director of Strategic Communications Hope Hicks told the press, \u201cThe transition is not concerned about the appearance of a conflict. This is an annual celebratory event at the private club, like others that have continued to occur since the election.\u201d Hicks added, \u201cthe president cannot and does not have a conflict.\u201d Celebrations in Barcelona looked pretty spectacular.

Meanwhile in Trump life, Politico reports that the author of a 1993 biography about the business tycoon, Harry Hurt, has had a New Year\u2019s Eve run-in with his former book subject. Politico reports: President-elect Donald Trump on Friday ejected from his West Palm Beach golf course one of his most critical biographers, Harry Hurt III, who had been preparing to play in a foursome with billionaire mega-donor David Koch. Hurt is the author of \u201cLost Tycoon: The Many Lives of Donald J. Trump,\u201d a 1993 book that revealed among other things that Trump was accused of \u201crape\u201d by his ex-wife Ivana Trump in a sworn deposition during their divorce proceedings. On Friday, Hurt approached Trump on the practice tee at Trump International Golf Club, and congratulated him on his victory in last month\u2019s presidential election, according to an account that Hurt posted on Facebook on Saturday. Trump responded by criticizing Hurt\u2019s biography as untrue, to which Hurt replied \u201cIt\u2019s all true,\u201d according to both Hurt\u2019s Facebook post and a transition official who was briefed on the incident, but did not want to be identified discussing a testy exchange involving the president-elect. Trump told Hurt \u201cyou\u2019re out of here,\u201d according to the transition official, while Hurt wrote on Facebook that Trump told him it was \u201cinappropriate\u201d for him to play at the club.

A year on and Cologne police have deployed 1,500 officers - 10 times the number of officers compared to last year. Extra security guards are also on duty to ensure the area is safe for New Year\u2019s Eve party-goers The Press Association is reporting that paramedics are dealing with a high level of emergency calls on New Year\u2019s Eve: Paramedics were struggling to reach patients in parts of the south-east on New Year\u2019s Eve amid a high level of 999 calls. South East Coast ambulance service NHS foundation trust (Secamb) said 999 callers in Kent in particular were being hit by delays in crews reaching them due to the high demand. Managers said they were focusing on responding to life-threatening 999 calls as they urged people to think carefully about whether they really needed an ambulance. Secamb\u2019s on-call gold incident commander Richard Webber said: \u201cWe are already receiving a high volume of emergency 999 calls, especially across Kent and are struggling to reach many of these in a timely manner. Our staff are already working extremely hard but this does mean that for certain emergencies, some patients can expect to wait longer for an ambulance as we focus our efforts on responding to calls which are deemed life-threatening.\u201d During the festive period, Secamb saw a 10% rise in demand compared to last year. From 7pm on Christmas Eve to 11pm on Boxing Day it responded to 4,840 emergency calls. Last year, between 10pm on New Year\u2019s Eve and 4am on 1 January, the trust handled 1,135 calls \u2013 an average of more than three 999 calls a minute \u2013 and this year is expected to be even higher. Webber urged people to only dial 999 in a \u201cserious emergency\u201d and asked them to consider other options, including the NHS 111 service. Partly in response to high call levels, it emerged this week that Secamb\u2019s specialist critical care paramedics are being brought into the overall cover plan system to make them available to respond to all types of call. The change, revealed in a leaked memo, provoked criticism among CCPs who fear lives could be endangered by them being tied up with non-urgent calls instead of dealing with life-threatening emergencies as they have done previously. Secamb managers have defended the move, saying that with high demand and poor response times it could not continue the current model of not sending CCPs to certain categories of patient. The change will run until the end of March 2017 when it will be reviewed. Secamb, which covers Kent, Surrey, Sussex and north-east Hampshire, was put into special measures in September after the Care Quality Commission ranked it inadequate. The change is part of its recovery plan. Fears that selfie sticks would become pass\u00e9 in 2017 appear totally unfounded as new year partygoers in Hong Kong capture the turn of the year. Swedes see in 1 January with a ny\u00e5rst\u00e5rta, or new year\u2019s cake. Here\u2019s a trifle cake inspired by Pok\u00e9mon Go. One of many being baked up and down the country this evening. Looks good ... Having completed the important diplomatic work of saluting his \u201cmany enemies and those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don\u2019t know what to do\u201d, President-elect Donald Trump will see in the New Year with 800 guests at an \u201celegant and sophisticated\u201d party at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Rather in the vein of a planned inauguration in which big names and smaller names \u2013 such as those of individual Rockettes and members of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir \u2013 have declined to perform, in the last case preferring not to be seen to endorse \u201ctyranny and fascism\u201d, the calibre of celebrities on the guest list seems uncertain at best. As of Saturday morning, ageing Hollywood action star Sylvester Stallone, who reportedly turned down Trump\u2019s offer of a job with the National Endowment for the Arts, was still due to attend. The legendary music producer Quincy Jones, however, was not. In a call with reporters on Friday, incoming White House spokesman Sean Spicer mentioned the two stars as guests. Later, a spokesman for Jones \u2013 a Clinton donor \u2013 said he did not know how Spicer got that idea, as Jones would be seeing in 2017 with his family in Los Angeles. Ongoing concerns about potential conflicts of interest between President Trump and Businessman Trump have also infringed on the party. Politico reported on Friday that Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks rejected suggestions that the sale of tickets, at between $525 and $575 a head, constituted the sale of access to the president-elect and his family. \u201cThe transition is not concerned about the appearance of a conflict,\u201d Hicks said, on the same call as Spicer. \u201cThis is an annual celebratory event at the private club, like others that have continued to occur since the election. \u201cAdditionally, the president cannot and does not have a conflict.\u201d Some beg to differ. Koreans celebrate their day of birth but also mark growing a year older from 1 January.

Oops. It will be midnight in Hong Kong shortly. Strictly Come Dancing pro, Neil Jones, is there and will be enjoying the fireworks from a rooftop. A reader, Ian, is also in Hong Kong waiting for the fireworks. Meanwhile in Beijing ... What\u2019s the best way to celebrate NYE? With pie and Prosecco. D\u2019oh! It sounds like the Queen may have to spend at least one more day in bed as she is still recovering from her heavy cold. The monarch has not been seen in public for 11 days since she and Prince Philip sustained heavy colds, forcing them to cancel the traditional train journey to their north Norfolk estate for Christmas. Earlier this week, Buckingham Palace was forced to issue a statement confirming the Queen was still alive after a tweet from a fake BBC News account claimed she had died. Lots of people in Asia are now tweeting pictures from their New Year\u2019s Eve celebrations. Bali looks a bit good! A bit of fun for the dying hours of 2016: Trevor Noah of The Daily Show bid farewell to the year many will care to forget. It\u2019s already 2017 in parts of Russia. In South Korea, protesters have set off their own fireworks during a candle-lit vigil calling for the impeached president, Park Geun-hye, to step down, near the presidential house in Seoul. A Sri Lankan woman lights oil lamps as other devotees carry various offerings at a Buddhist temple on New Year\u2019s Eve in Colombo, Sri Lanka. Lots of people in Switzerland wave goodbye to the old year by swimming in a very chilly lake. Whatever floats your boat! Do you do anything special to mark the last day of the year? Tweet me @Nicola_Slawson or send me an email: nicola.slawson@theguardian.com In Japan, New Year\u2019s Eve is traditionally a day spent with family and although there will be fireworks over Tokyo\u2019s Disneyland castle, the bars will remain fairly quiet. Elliot Morris decided to do something a bit different while holidaying in the capital city and went to watch a New Year\u2019s Eve boxing match at Ota City Gym. He said: \u201cIt was fantastic and very fun. We are now just in a quiet bar.\u201d How are you celebrating the new year? Tweet me @Nicola_Slawson or send me an email: nicola.slawson@theguardian.com. My colleague Emma Beddington has written a guide to surviving New Year\u2019s Eve with children. Does this ring any bells? Traditionally a grave disappointment, New Year\u2019s Eve is at least a time to cut loose and escape the suffocating, sprout-scented stranglehold of the family Christmas. But with kids, you can forget about that. You\u2019re far too late (and broke) for babysitters. Everyone is bored, bloated, probably sick, definitely fighting and stuck with one another. How can you reach midnight without tears? Worshippers of Yemanj\u00e1 ask for blessings from their deity at Copacabana \u2013 before one of the world\u2019s largest New Year\u2019s Eve beach parties kicks off. Brisbane just welcomed in 2017. It looks nice and tropical there, a bit different to the cold and foggy weather on this side of the world. When 2017 reaches the UK capital, thousands of police officers will provide a protective ring around the city\u2019s set-piece fireworks display, with security tactics having been adjusted after this year\u2019s terrorist atrocities in Europe. Armed police will also be a fixture on the capital\u2019s tube trains as they travel between jobs \u2013 a move aimed at reassuring passengers. Fears of a mass-casualty terrorist plot targeting one of the country\u2019s new year events have been heightened after lorries were used in devastating attacks on crowded areas in Nice and Berlin. British Transport Police (BTP) said they would be extending officers\u2019 working hours on the night for a second year running. The BTP superintendent Andy Morgan said: \u201cWe developed and improved our security plan for last year\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve event following the atrocities in Paris in the previous November and we, of course, have looked at good security, a thorough security boost following a different type of threat in Nice back in July. \u201cIn general, we have a good eyeline on what could happen, we\u2019ve got very, very good assets both covert and overt deployed out within the footprint and across London, almost joined at the hip with our colleagues from the Metropolitan police to make sure that we\u2019re working together to provide that security blanket across London.\u201d Incidentally, it\u2019s not the first time Donald Trump has thought to mention his enemies while sending good wishes on special holidays or events. Here\u2019s a thanksgiving tweet from 2012: This was on the anniversary of 9/11 in 2013: Here\u2019s his Father\u2019s Day message from the following year: And one from Memorial Day in 2015: The New Year enthusiasm is at risk of being dampened here in the UK. The fog in the south has caused delays at Gatwick and Manchester, while in northern England and Wales, rain is set to sweep across areas including Manchester, Leeds and possibly Cardiff at midnight, the Met Office said. Spectacular fireworks have illuminated Sydney Harbour Bridge to celebrate the arrival of 2017 in Australia, as Britons count the hours until the new year also lands in the UK. The Pacific island nations of Samoa, Tonga and Kiribati were the first to welcome the new year as the clock hit 10am on New Year\u2019s Eve in London. The end of 2016 was then marked in the Chatham Islands and parts of New Zealand shortly afterwards, with fireworks launched from the top of Auckland\u2019s Sky Tower, before celebrations began in Sydney at 1pm London time. Sydney Harbour Bridge was doused in the bright light of an estimated seven tonnes of fireworks during two displays, including an earlier show which saw the landmark bridge glow purple in a tribute to the late US singer Prince. British singer David Bowie was also honoured with space-themed fireworks as a nod to the late star\u2019s hit Space Oddity. Here\u2019s US President-elect Donald Trump being all nice and positive as he wishes everyone a Happy New Year. Oh, wait \u2026 Sydney welcomes 2017 in with lots of loud and colourful fireworks, as per usual. Fireworks Sydney style... Happy New Year Sydney! The fireworks have started and are set to feature tributes to Prince and David Bowie. Send us your snaps! How are you spending the last day of 2016? Libby Maguire spent it exploring the Australian coast. \u201cI did the Bondi to Coogee coastal walk to celebrate the last day of the year ... I\u2019m now at a house party at the beach with an Aussie band playing some hits.\u201d Do you do anything special to mark the last day of the year? Tweet me @Nicola_Slawsonor send me an email: nicola.slawson@theguardian.com In Spain it is traditional for people to eat one grape at every stroke of the midnight clock chimes on New Year\u2019s Eve to bring luck in the following year. Some extra keen people held a warm-up session at midday in Madrid\u2019s Puerta del Sol. Curious as to how Sydney organises its always impressive fireworks displays? Wonder no more: Safety and security is high on the agenda for New Year celebrations around the world this year: I love this photograph of a passenger plane flying in front of a rainbow during New Year\u2019s Eve celebrations in Taipei, Taiwan. This year\u2019s celebration in the city will use fireworks combined with a light show for the first time, with an estimated cost of TW$45m (\u00a31.1m). A Guardian reader in Taiwan also sent us this photograph of her family\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve feast. Laura Pepper Wu said: \u201cWe are celebrating our baby\u2019s first NYE with a dim sum dinner here in Taiwan! Happy New Year!\u201d How are you celebrating the new year? Tweet me @Nicola_Slawson or send me an email: nicola.slawson@theguardian.com More pretty pictures from down under courtesy of ABC News Australia: While most people are gathering to ring in the new year, in South Korea people have once again gathered in protest. Even on New Year\u2019s Eve, large crowds of protesters have turned out in Seoul to demand the resignation of the impeached President Park Geun-hye, who is determined to restore her powers through a court trial. South Korea isn\u2019t the only country to have celebrations dampened by national events. Normally boisterous Bangkok will see in the new year on a more sombre note, with prayers and candles replacing parties as the nation grieves for King Bhumibol Adulyadej who died in October. With Brazil mired in its worst recession in a century, the fireworks there have been cut to just 12 minutes as the state government fights bankruptcy. However, up to 2 million people are still expected to party on Rio\u2019s Copacabana beach. Security concerns have hit many new year events this year, with many cities opting to set up truck blockades as a new tactic to try to prevent vehicles ploughing into crowds, as happened in Berlin and Nice this year. While Sydney is using garbage trucks as safety barriers, the German capital has beefed up security after the 19 December attack, deploying hundreds more police, some armed with machine-guns. \u201cThis year, what\u2019s new is that we will place concrete blocks and position heavy armoured vehicles at the entrances\u201d to the zone around Brandenburg Gate, a police spokesman said. In Cologne, aftersexual attacks during New Year\u2019s Eve events last year, 1,800 police will be deployed, compared with just 140 in 2015. In neighbouring Austria, police will hand out 6,000 free pocket alarms to help prevent assaults on women. In Paris, there will be a full fireworks display again, after 2015 celebrations were muted following the massacre of 130 people on 13 November of that year. Nearly 100,000 police, gendarmes and soldiers will be deployed across France against the terrorist threat. With more than a million people expected to turn up to watch the ball drop in Times Square, New York is deploying 165 \u201cblocker\u201d trucks and about 7,000 police. Rome has organised armoured vehicles and a greater numbers of security forces around the Coliseum and at St Peter\u2019s Square where Pope Francis will celebrate midnight mass. In Moscow, police will deploy more than 5,000 officers, backed by thousands more from the new national guard and volunteer militia, to maintain order. Thousands traditionally gather in Red Square, but for the second year in a row, the area will be open solely to 6,000 invitees. In London, 3,000 officers will be on patrol among crowds lining the banks of the river Thames to watch the fireworks over the London Eye. In case you\u2019re confused, Sydney has two sets of fireworks \u2013 one at 9pm (for families who don\u2019t want to be out too late), and the other at midnight proper, which falls at 1pm GMT. Here\u2019s a time lapse of the 9pm fireworks, boiled down to a mere 16 seconds by Mike Bowers, Guardian Australia\u2019s photographer-at-large: Does anyone else think the Sky Tower in Auckland looks like a bit like a pineapple in this stunning shot? Many of us can\u2019t wait for 2016 to be over, but did you know that we are going to have to endure an entire extra second of it? The National Physical Laboratory (NPL) is to introduce a \u201cleap second\u201d after 23.59:59 on 31 December. As a result, clocks striking 00:00:00 will actually be recording a time of 23:59:60 \u2013 delaying midnight by a second. It will be the 27th time the NPL has brought in a leap second to ensure that time based on the Earth\u2019s rotation does not lag behind time kept by atomic clocks. Read more about that here: Shame about the lack of capital letters in this tweet from the City of Sydney, but it\u2019s more about the picture of course ... The celebrations in Sydney have already kicked off with a children\u2019s fireworks display. Tell us how you are celebrating in your part of the world. A hop and skip over the Tasman Sea and Australia is gearing up for its famous new year celebrations in Sydney and will be defying the increased terror threat. About 1.5 million people are packing Australia\u2019s biggest city to watch the midnight fireworks, a larger-than-usual crowd due to the weekend timing and warm weather, as the New South Wales state premier urged \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d. \u201cMy encouragement to everyone is to enjoy New Year\u2019s Eve \u2026 in the knowledge that police are doing everything they can to keep us safe,\u201d Mike Baird said. The year of 2016 has seen repeated bloodshed around the world, most recently a deadly truck attack at a Berlin Christmas market, as well as a similar incident on Bastille Day in France that killed 86, as well as atrocities in Turkey and the Middle East, and the war in Syria. About 2,000 extra officers have been deployed in Sydney after a man was arrested for allegedly making threats online about the celebrations. There were a number of other reported threats this holiday period, in the Asia-Pacific region and elsewhere. In Melbourne, police said they foiled a \u201csignificant\u201d Islamic State-inspired Christmas Day terrorism plot. Indonesia said it had foiled plans by an Isis-linked group for a Christmas suicide bombing, and 52 died in the Philippines in bomb attacks blamed on Islamist militants. Israel on Friday issued a warning of imminent \u201cterrorist attacks\u201d on tourists and western targets in India, telling its citizens to avoid public places. Only a couple of minutes to go until midnight in New Zealand. How are you celebrating? Tweet me @nicola_slawson and let me know. Not everyone is having a good night in Auckland though, thanks to public transport woes! Happy New Year\u2019s Eve! Welcome to our last live blog of the year, probably. Join us as we chart the new year being welcomed in across the globe. For those desperate to see the back of 2016, the good news is it is already 2017 in Samoa!",

          "bodyText": "Barack Obama has permanently banned new oil and gas drilling in most US-owned waters in the Arctic and Atlantic oceans, a last-ditch effort to lock in environmental protections before he hands over to Donald Trump. Obama used a 1953 law that allows presidents to block the sale of new offshore drilling and mining rights and makes it difficult for their successors to reverse the decision. However, Obama\u2019s ban \u2013 affecting federal waters off Alaska in the Chukchi Sea and most of the Beaufort Sea and in the Atlantic from New England to the Chesapeake Bay \u2013 is unprecedented in scale and could be challenged by Trump in court. The president-elect has vowed to unleash the country\u2019s untapped energy reserves and exploit fossil fuels. He has previously questioned the science of climate change, threatened to tear up the Paris climate agreement and appointed climate-change deniers in his cabinet. This has led to a scramble from environmentalists calling on Obama to impose whatever regulations and executive orders he can to protect his climate legacy. Tuesday\u2019s move came in a joint announcement by Obama and the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, who also put a moratorium on new oil and gas leasing in its Arctic waters, subject to periodic review. Obama, currently on holiday in Hawaii and with only a month left in office, said in a statement: \u201cThese actions, and Canada\u2019s parallel actions, protect a sensitive and unique ecosystem that is unlike any other region on earth. They reflect the scientific assessment that, even with the high safety standards that both our countries have put in place, the risks of an oil spill in this region are significant and our ability to clean up from a spill in the region\u2019s harsh conditions is limited. \u201cBy contrast, it would take decades to fully develop the production infrastructure necessary for any large-scale oil and gas leasing production in the region \u2013 at a time when we need to continue to move decisively away from fossil fuels.\u201d In 2015, just 0.1% of US federal offshore crude production came from the Arctic.

The development marks the first time in a decade that the ethics commissioner has questioned a sitting prime minister and is a turning point for Trudeau who swept to a majority government last year on broad promises to run a transparent administration that would abide by the highest standards of ethics. The scandal began brewing in October, after a series of media reports documented Liberal party fundraisers being held in the homes of wealthy Canadians and which offered access to members of Trudeau\u2019s government for up to C$1,500 ($1,100) a ticket. The reports raised questions of whether the government was opening itself up to behind-the-scenes lobbying, such as a report by the Globe and Mail that quoted a British Columbia multimillionaire who said he had urged the prime minister to allow Chinese investment in senior care and real estate development just as the government was reviewing a bid by a China-based company to purchase a majority stake in one of British Columbia\u2019s largest chains of retirement homes. The allegations, which have left Trudeau and his government fending off daily accusations of wrongdoing, triggered complaints to the ethics commissioner from the opposition Conservatives and the New Democratic party. Responding to the complaint from the Conservatives, Mary Dawson, Canada\u2019s ethics commissioner said in a letter on Thursday that while there is no evidence to date to suggest that Trudeau violated the country\u2019s conflict of interest act, she would query Trudeau over his involvement with the fundraising events.

          "bodyText": "Justin Trudeau on how Canada is bucking the populist trend Globalization \u201cdoesn\u2019t seem to be working for the middle class, for ordinary people\u201d, Justin Trudeau told the Guardian, as he sought to explain a turbulent year marked by the election of Donald Trump, Brexit and the rise of anti-establishment, nation-first parties around the world. Elected last year, the Canadian prime minister is under pressure to show the world that his government has found an alternative means of tackling the concerns of those who feel they have been left behind. Justin Trudeau: \u2018Globalisation isn\u2019t working for ordinary people\u2019 Evacuation begins in Aleppo Wounded civilians in east Aleppo are being loaded on to ambulances as a long-awaited evacuation of the besieged districts of the city gets under way. The movement came almost five hours after the evacuation was due to begin, when the process appeared stalled while medical teams waited amid reports of gunfire. The evacuation is being overseen by the Syrian Arab Red Crescent and the International Committee of the Red Cross, which said it would include the wounded and all civilians. The first convoy of 10 vehicles is expected to transport 200-250 wounded people in its first rotation and there will be multiple crossings throughout the day. The evacuation deal was agreed late on Wednesday, and under its terms, a ceasefire went into effect at 2.30am local time on Thursday, two rebel officials confirmed. Syria: ambulances on the move as Aleppo evacuation operation begins Follow live updates Breitbart\u2019s \u2018fake news\u2019 attack on Guardian refuted Breitbart News has \u201caccused the Guardian of disseminating false information for reporting a fundamental and demonstrably provable fact: that the number of undocumented border crossers is near a historic low\u201d, Rory Carroll writes, after the rightwing site claimed to have \u201cfact-checked\u201d a Guardian profile of a Border Patrol agent, which they blasted as \u201cfake news\u201d. We set out the facts and refute Breitbart\u2019s claims. How Breitbart and the conservative right opened a new front in the war over fake news Trump could put intelligence agencies in peril, says former CIA chief Trump\u2019s public disparagement of US intelligence agencies would undermine the moral authority of their leaders to send them \u201cinto harm\u2019s way\u201d, Michael Hayden, who served as director of the NSA and then the CIA during the George W Bush administration, said. It would be \u201cdiscouraging\u201d if Trump were to reject or not use information from the agencies. \u201cThat information is sometimes bought at great price,\u201d Hayden said. Donald Trump risks damaging intelligence agencies, warns former CIA chief Chinese state media call for taking Taiwan by force Following Trump\u2019s breaking of diplomatic protocol by speaking with the president of Taiwan, the Global Times, a Communist party-controlled newspaper, has said that China should plan to take Taiwan by force and make swift preparations for a military incursion. The president-elect has called into question the longstanding US foreign policy of maintaining formal relations with Beijing instead of Taiwan, which China considers a breakaway province. The tabloid said on Thursday that China should rebalance its stance towards Taiwan to \u201cmake the use of force as a main option and carefully prepare for it\u201d. China should plan to take Taiwan by force after Trump call, state media say One billion Yahoo accounts compromised in hack Yahoo said on Wednesday it had discovered another major cyber-attack, saying data from more than 1bn user accounts was compromised in August 2013, making it the largest such breach in history. \u201cAn unauthorised party\u201d broke into the accounts, a statement on Yahoo\u2019s website said. The number of users affected in this hack was double the number implicated in a 2014 breach which the company disclosed in September. Yahoo hack: 1bn accounts compromised by biggest data breach in history Impeach Duterte over killing confession, say Philippine senators The admission of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte that he used to personally kill suspected criminals when mayor of Davao city is grounds for impeachment, two of the nation\u2019s senators said. A move to impeach Duterte is unlikely to succeed, as he has allies in congress and domestic support for his bloody war on drugs, in which police have reported killing 2,086 people. The justice minister, Vitaliano Aguirre, dismissed Duterte\u2019s comments as \u201chyperbole\u201d. Philippine senators call for Duterte to be impeached over killing confession Support the Guardian\u2019s fearless journalism Never has America needed fearless independent media more.

          "bodyText": "Ordinary people around the world have been failed by globalisation, Justin Trudeau has told the Guardian, as he sought to explain a turbulent year marked by the election of Donald Trump, the Brexit vote and the rise of anti-establishment, nation-first parties around the world. \u201cWhat we\u2019re facing right now \u2013 in terms of the rise of populism and divisive and fearful narratives around the world \u2013 it\u2019s based around the fact that globalisation doesn\u2019t seem to be working for the middle class, for ordinary people,\u201d the Canadian prime minister said in an interview at his oak-panelled office in the country\u2019s parliament. \u201cAnd this is something that we identified years ago and built an entire platform and agenda for governing on.\u201d Last year, at a time when Trump was being described as a long shot for president and the threat of Brexit seemed a distant possibility, Trudeau, 44, swept to a majority government on an ambitious platform that included addressing growing inequality and creating real change for the country\u2019s middle class. One year on, what has emerged is a government that seems to go against the political tide around the world; open to trade, immigration and diversity and led by a social media star whose views on feminism, Syrian refugees and LGBT rights have provoked delight among progressives. But as he enters his second year in power, Trudeau \u2013 a former high school teacher and snowboarding instructor \u2013 is under pressure to show the world that his government has found an alternative means of tackling the concerns of those who feel they\u2019ve been left behind. He cited the signing of Ceta \u2013 the free trade deal between the EU and Canada \u2013 and a hotly contested decision to approve two pipelines as examples of this approach. \u201cWe were able to sign free trade agreement with Europe at a time when people tend to be closing off,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re actually able to approve pipelines at a time when everyone wants protection of the environment. We\u2019re being able to show that we get people\u2019s fears and there are constructive ways of allaying them \u2013 and not just ways to lash out and give a big kick to the system.\u201d Canada has not remained immune to such pressures, he said \u2013 despite what the fresh wave of interest in migrating to the country in the wake of Trump\u2019s victory and the Brexit vote would suggest. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of people saying \u2018oh well, Canada is a special place,\u2019 and we are,\u201d said Trudeau. \u201cBut we are subject to the same kinds of tensions and forces that so much of the world is facing right now.\u201d Trudeau said he is keenly aware that the world is watching. \u201cI think it\u2019s always been understood that Canada is not a country that\u2019s going to stand up and beat its chest on the world stage, but we can be very helpful in modelling solutions that work,\u201d he said. \u201cQuite frankly if we can show \u2013 as we are working very hard to demonstrate \u2013 that you can have engaged global perspectives and growth that works for everyone \u2026 then that diffuses a lot of the uncertainty, the anger, the populism that is surfacing in different pockets of the world.\u201d In January, Trudeau\u2019s government will face off against its greatest challenge to date: a Trump presidency. When it comes to US relations, few countries have as much at stake as Canada \u2013 last year saw nearly three-quarters of Canada\u2019s exports head to the US while some 400,000 people a day cross the shared border. Trudeau\u2019s father, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, Canada\u2019s prime minister during the late 1960s, 70s and 80s, once likened living next to the US to sleeping with an elephant. \u201cNo matter how friendly and even-tempered is the beast, if I can call it that, one is affected by every twitch and grunt,\u201d he told the Washington Press Club in 1969. Nearly five decades on, his son is poised to weather what will probably be one of the toughest tests of this sentiment. The prime minister and the president-elect seem to have little in common; Trudeau is a self-described feminist who appointed his country\u2019s first gender-balanced cabinet, while Trump\u2019s campaign saw more than a dozen women come forward with allegations of sexual misconduct. Trudeau has sought to champion trade deals such as Ceta, while Trump has threatened to rip up Nafta and bury TPP. The contrast was captured last December after Trump and Trudeau catapulted into global headlines within days of each other over their response to the Syrian refugee crisis; Trump, who had called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the US, suggested that families fleeing war could be Isis infiltrators; Trudeau, in contrast was at the Toronto airport to greet the first wave of the tens of thousands of Syrian refugees airlifted to Canada in the past year. Trudeau skirted past these differences, instead highlighting the links that bridge both administrations. On Syrian refugees, for example, Trudeau pointed to underlying concerns around security. \u201cCertainly in a world where terrorism is a daily reality in the news, it\u2019s easy for people to be afraid,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the fact is that we laid out very clearly \u2013 and Canadians get \u2013 that it\u2019s actually not a choice between either immigration or security, that of course they go together.\u201d The two governments are also keen to create policies that address those who feel that globalisation and trade have failed to benefit the middle class and those working to join it, said Trudeau. \u201cThere are differences in the policies, the solutions for it, but I know that when we talk about making sure there are good jobs for the middle class, that is a place where we are going to be able to find agreement and alignment on.\u201d A silver lining for Trudeau may lie in Trump\u2019s pledge to resurrect plans for TransCanada\u2019s Keystone XL pipeline. When the Obama administration rejected the plan last year, Trudeau said in a statement he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d in the decision. When Trudeau called Trump to congratulate him after the election, the two briefly spoke about Keystone, said Trudeau, adding that it remains to be see how the US will move forward with plans for the pipeline. Any reluctance to move forward on climate change south of the border could be a boon for Canadian companies across various sectors, said Trudeau. \u201cI know Canada is well positioned to pick up some of the slack and when people finally realise that it\u2019s a tremendous business opportunity to lead on climate change, Canada will already have a head start.\u201d But he also cast doubt on Trump\u2019s ability to completely derail US efforts towards combatting climate change. \u201cYou know quite frankly at the subnational level in the United States, states, municipalities are already showing that they understand that climate change is real so that the potential for the federal government to ease off on actions is not total,\u201d he said. Last week\u2019s announcement of a national carbon price is a key part of Trudeau\u2019s environmental policy \u2013 one that has been derided by environmentalists for enabling the expansion of fossil fuels, compensated by initiatives that include investments in clean tech and promises to phase out federal subsidies for oil and gas companies. The policy saw Trudeau recently approve a liquefied natural gas project in British Columbia as well as two pipelines that will offer Alberta\u2019s oil sands nearly a million barrels a day in increased capacity. The approvals have sparked broad opposition among environmentalists, some First Nations and several of the communities affected by the planned infrastructure projects. \u201cThere is a number of people out there who\u2019ve always [believed] if you stop pipeline, you stop the oil sands,\u201d said Trudeau. \u201cWell, actually as we\u2019ve seen, it doesn\u2019t work that way and what we end up with is much more oil by rail.\u201d The discontent has chipped away at Trudeau\u2019s unprecedented political honeymoon, along with revelations of fundraisers that offered access to Trudeau and his ministers for a price, a government decision to push forward with a C$15bn ($11bn) deal to sell weaponised military vehicles to Saudi Arabia amid outcry by human rights organisations as well as speculation that his government is moving away from a promise to reform the country\u2019s voting system. Still, recent polls suggest that were Canada to hold an election today, Trudeau\u2019s team would earn an even greater proportion of votes than they did last year. The government\u2019s environmental policy takes a long view on the transition to a carbon-free economy, said Trudeau. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen in a day, or in a week, but it will happen over years and perhaps a decade or two,\u201d he said. \u201cI know there are people out there extremely passionate about the environment, who don\u2019t think I made the right decision on approving a couple of pipelines.

          "body": "<p>The cliched threat to move to Canada because of political unpleasantness in your own country \u2013 entirely hypothetical unpleasantness, of course (<em>cough</em> trumpfaragelepen) \u2013 often seems empty. It\u2019s like a stroppy kid saying he\u2019s going to run away from home, to which the standard parental response is: \u201cBe my guest.\u201d</p> <p>For the British loyalists who fled the US revolution, however, or the tens of thousands of black slaves who travelled via the Underground Railroad, or the roughly same number of conscientious objectors to the Vietnam War in the 1960s and 70s, Canada has long been a place of refuge.</p> <p>Nor is emigrating to Canada just about escape. The country\u2019s particular combination of social tolerance, relative gender equality, collaborative cultural spirit and 4.7 quadrillion trees have attracted global emigres for as long as Canada has been an independent nation. (One hundred and fifty years next 1 July, but you knew that.)</p> <p>Equally cliche, perhaps, would be to suggest that each brings a story.

Maria Toorpakai, who lived as a boy for more than a decade.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lorne Bridgman for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It doesn\u2019t take long to track Maria Toorpakai down in the Toronto financial district club where she now trains. Everyone nods to the squash courts where the 25-year-old has spent the morning.</p> <p>It hasn\u2019t always been so easy to find her. In 2007, death threats from the Taliban forced her into hiding. Confined to her home in Pakistan\u2019s Waziristan region for more than three years, she spent hours each day playing squash in her bedroom, turning the walls into a makeshift court. </p> <p>Although she was only 16, much of her life had already been spent at war with the entrenched gender roles of her tribal region. \u201cWomen are considered weak, not smart and [are] confined to four walls,\u201d says Toorpakai. </p> <p>Her first attempt to challenge this idea came at the age of four when she burned all her dresses in the backyard and lopped off her hair with a pair of sewing scissors. She braced herself for her father\u2019s reaction. \u201cRather than him getting angry, he just laughed and said, \u2018Your name is Genghis Khan from now on.\u2019\u201d </p> <p>For the next eight years she lived outwardly as a boy. </p> <p>She developed a reputation as tough, challenging boys to fights. And it was when, aged 12, one of these fights landed her in hospital that her father looked to the local sports arena for an outlet for Toorpakai\u2019s energy.</p> <p>It was there that she fell in love with squash. \u201cI just liked the way the kids were playing, everybody was watching them, clapping and they\u2019re jumping, diving, getting the ball \u2013 the rackets are so beautiful.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Some of my family and friends, they were kidnapped. Some were killed</p> <footer> <cite>Maria Toorpakai</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There was a moment when, after years of living as a boy, it seemed as if the jig might be up. Signing up at a squash academy, her father was asked to produce Toorpakai\u2019s birth certificate. He took a gamble, saying, \u201cThis is my daughter, actually.\u201d The academy owner surprised them with his reaction: \u201cHe said: \u2018I\u2019m so happy that finally a girl is playing sports here,\u2019\u201d and handed her a brand new racquet emblazoned with the name of Jonathon Power, then the world\u2019s top-ranked squash player.</p> <p>Toorpakai spent hours each day on the court. The only female player in the region, she attracted constant scrutiny. She endured leering and bullying, but focused instead on winning tournaments. She climbed to the top of the country\u2019s junior national rankings in 2005 \u2013 only two years after she first picked up a racquet. </p> <p>But with success came unwanted attention, and that\u2019s when the death threats started. The Taliban was active in the region and she knew the threats couldn\u2019t be ignored: \u201cSome of my family and friends, they were kidnapped, some were killed.\u201d</p> <p>She confined herself at home for safety, but did her best to keep training, pausing only to send emails around the world, offering her services as a coach in exchange for a place where she could train without fear.</p> <p>One of her few replies came from Power, the man whose name was inscribed on her first racket. Retired and teaching squash in Toronto, he told her he had been to Pakistan and offered to help. \u201cIt was unbelievable to know that someone like Jonathon Power was sending me a message. A world champion.\u201d </p> <p>She landed in Toronto in March 2011. Power met her at the airport. \u201cEveryone just received me with so much love. Right away we started playing, figuring out my training schedule.\u201d Five years later, Toorpakai is Pakistan\u2019s top-ranked female squash player. </p> <p>Off court, Toorpakai now shares a home in Toronto with three friends and relishes a life of squash, cooking and the occasional movie. \u201cOut of the whole world, God chose Canada for me,\u201d she says. But while Canada is where Toopakai found the freedom to play, she\u2019s adamant it\u2019s Pakistan she represents in competition. Squash \u2013 one of her homeland\u2019s most popular sports \u2013 has become a medium through which she can push for change in how women are seen and treated. \u201cIf I keep playing for Pakistan, then I can inspire many girls,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd they can believe in themselves.\u201d </p> <p><em>Ashifa Kassam</em></p> <h2><strong>The adventurer</strong></h2> <p><strong>Graeme Dargo, one of the last \u2018Bay Boys\u2019</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a965777f23c3290f715e3bc07ff144071d610953\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a965777f23c3290f715e3bc07ff144071d610953/0_2324_5792_3475/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Graeme Dargo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I had visions of fir trees\u2019 ... Scottish-born Graeme Dargo learned to grade furs and negotiate with trappers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lorne Bridgman for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On a February morning in 1981, Graeme Dargo stood in the middle of a frozen lake in northern Saskatchewan watching a three-seater plane take off without him. A suitcase with all of the belongings he\u2019d brought with him from Scotland was all that stood between him and the wilderness.</p> <p>\u201cHe took off and I\u2019m going, \u2018Holy shit, what have I done?\u2019\u201d says Dargo. \u201cBut this was part of the big adventure \u2013 exactly what I\u2019d expected.\u201d</p> <p>Though he didn\u2019t know it at the time, Dargo was in the last cohort of a centuries-old tradition: recruiting <a href=\"http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/scotsandcanada/hudsonsbaycompany/hudsonsbaycompany.asp\">young Scots to staff the Arctic outposts of the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company</a>. Dubbed \u201cBay Boys\u201d, these experience-hungry men worked the backbone of stores that supplied Canada\u2019s most remote settlements. </p> <p>Dargo had graduated at 16 in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/standrewsuniversity\">StAndrews</a> \u2013 the so-called home of golf \u2013 and embarked on life as a butcher. Then at 21, just as he was growing dissatisfied with his job, he saw a newspaper advert for young people to work in \u201ca company of adventurers\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cI had visions of fir trees and big lakes, and a very nomadic wilderness kind of life,\u201d says Dargo. \u201cAlmost like a tourism ad for the Rockies.\u201d<br></p> <p>The small plane actually deposited Dargo outside the <a href=\"http://www.encyclopedia.com/history/united-states-and-canada/north-american-indigenous-peoples/chipewyan\">Chipewyan</a>-speaking community of La Loche, Saskatchewan, where \u2013 despite never having previously seen a gun \u2013 he took up hunting, fishing and trapping with his aboriginal co-workers.</p> <p>At the time, Hudson\u2019s Bay \u2013 still North America\u2019s oldest company \u2013 was the largest purchaser of furs in northern Canada. Dargo would pay a hunter-trapper an advance to cover ammunition, traps and supplies, and the man would return from a season of travelling with large sacks of furs. Dargo learned to grade the furs and negotiate a price.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Maybe this is a Scottish thing, but I took the words \u2018civil servant\u2019 seriously</p> <footer> <cite>Graeme Dargo</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The European fur ban changed all that. It was devastating to the local communities. Dargo recalls the day an old man entered the store, laden with bags of fur, and Dargo had to tell him they wouldn\u2019t buy it. \u201cHe says, \u2018How can I pay my bill, then? How can I feed my family?\u2019 Oh, it was awful. I felt really badly about that.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, he was doing everything he could to become more Canadian. Curling came naturally to him, and he took up ice hockey \u2013 despite not knowing how to skate. After clinging to the boards for the first season, Dargo finally got the hang of it and scored a few goals. </p> <p>All his efforts paid off in the Inuit hamlet of Kimmirut, when a judge brought him in front of the community and naturalised him as a Canadian citizen.</p> <p>After nine years with the Hudson\u2019s Bay, Dargo joined the territorial government and embarked on a career that saw him become a deputy minister within just 10 years. \u201cMaybe this is a Scottish thing, but I took the words \u2018civil servant\u2019 seriously,\u201d he says. \u201cStill, I was also an entrepreneur by nature.\u201d He now works with a gold mining company to help prepare indigenous people to share in the employment benefits of development on their land.</p> <p>After 35 years in Canada, Dargo is a northern man, but Scotland still has a place in his heart. \u201cThis week, I\u2019m on vacation pursuing a traditional Scottish activity on the land: chasing a little white ball,\u201d he says. \u201cSome things we don\u2019t lose.\u201d</p> <p><em>Jessa Gamble</em></p> <h2><strong>The pop star</strong></h2> <p><strong>Meg Remy, aka US Girls</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2d4236851b47f7b861bdb4a491e8a07c925e1baf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d4236851b47f7b861bdb4a491e8a07c925e1baf/0_1014_5800_3480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Meg Remy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I grew up with guns, so it all felt familiar\u2019 ...

In the barely post-recession climate, Remy could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/25/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-pennsylvania\">already see the seeds of Trumpism</a>. \u201cI could feel it coming on, and I knew I wanted to go.\u201d</p> <p>Something like fate intervened when she was invited to perform a gig in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/mar/21/insiders-guide-halifax-canada-perks-city-relaxed-small-town\">Halifax</a>, Nova Scotia, though she nearly didn\u2019t go. \u201cThank God I did,\u201d she says. \u201cI walked into the club and <a href=\"http://thequietus.com/articles/16828-slim-twig-a-hound-at-the-hem-review\">Max [Turnbull, the pop psych musician who performs as Slim Twig]</a> was performing.\u201d For six months afterwards, they kept up a long-distance relationship. \u201cBut we knew it was right and we didn\u2019t mess around.\u201d</p> <p>That fall, she wrangled an artist residency at <a href=\"http://www.torontoartscape.org/artscape-gibraltar-point\">Gibraltar Point</a>, on bucolic Toronto Island. \u201cIt was amazing to be on this island where you could see the city, but you were removed from it. I was blown away that that place even existed.\u201d On Boxing Day she made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/jul/04/new-toronto-most-fascinatingly-boring-city-guardian-canada-week\">Toronto</a> her permanent home.</p> <p>Beyond love, Remy\u2019s decision to relocate north rests on the classic trifecta of Canadian qualities: gunlessness, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2012/may/15/nhs-learn-healthcare-canada\">healthcare</a> and arts grants.</p> <p>On guns: \u201cIn Chicago, a pregnant 21-year-old woman was shot in the back of the head outside my front door, dying instantly in her pink velour track suit. And one time in Philly, I was at Kinko\u2019s making copies and some guy came in to fax something. When it came time to pay, he pulled a gun and was like, \u2018I\u2019m not paying.\u2019 Then he walked out. It was for $1.70 or something. But I grew up with guns, so it all felt familiar.\u201d</p> <p>On health care: \u201cI would meet people from Canada and be like, \u2018So you can go to the doctor? Oh my God, that\u2019s so civilised.\u2019 When people in a society accept that, it comes with a whole lot of other stuff. Because that means that you fundamentally care about other people. It seeps into all other areas.\u201d</p> <p>On grants: \u201cWhen I started getting interested in making videos, I got a <a href=\"http://www.torontoartscouncil.org/home\">Toronto Arts Council</a> grant to make a short film. I had an idea, but didn\u2019t have the money. I submitted my proposal and got it, which was pretty amazing because I wasn\u2019t someone with a film career or anything. I was just a person with a good idea.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I would meet people from Canada and be like, \u2018So you can go to the doctor? That's so civilised'</p> <footer> <cite>Meg Remy</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Canada had another curious influence: the experimentalism of her earlier musical recordings gave way to overt nods to midcentury American pop classicism. US Girls began to embrace the sounds of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/motown\">Motown</a> and girl groups, albeit refracted through a sensibility that brought to mind <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/davidlynch\">David Lynch</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/cindy-sherman\">Cindy Sherman</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/feb/02/mike-kelley\">Mike Kelley</a>.</p> <p></p> <p>A case of clarity through distance, perhaps. But this shift in her musical identity also fits with the argument made by <a href=\"https://books.google.ca/books/about/Canadian_Mosaic.html?id=unxxAAAAMAAJ\">John Murray Gibbon in his 1938 book Canadian Mosaic</a>. Gibbon wrote about how nurturing cultural differences could be done in service of the federal whole \u2013 thereby laying the conceptual groundwork for the future adoption of multiculturalism as government policy under <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/sep/30/guardianobituaries\">Pierre Trudeau</a> in the 1970s. The idea contrasted with the much ballyhooed ideal of American assimilationism, the so-called \u201cmelting pot\u201d \u2013 so by this measure, in being more American in her music, Remy is paradoxically being more Canadian.</p> <p>Her move to Canada has also opened her up to more collaborative ways of making music.

He had certain privileges \u2013 a good school, a nice home \u2013 but with them came a life of constant vigilance.</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t allowed to go near our car until my dad had checked it first,\u201d he says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t answer the front door. I couldn\u2019t tell anyone what my dad did for a job.</p> <p>\u201cBut when you\u2019ve never known anything else, that\u2019s normal.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s one reason why, after university, he decided to follow in his father\u2019s footsteps by joining the Royal Ulster Constabulary. \u201cYou\u2019d put on the uniform and be a target,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I wasn\u2019t scared. It was exciting, in a perverse kind of way.\u201d</p> <p>He served for 14 years. After the end of the Troubles, however, Northern Ireland didn\u2019t need as many police officers. Many were directed toward retraining and transfer programs, and one day Woods attended a seminar \u201cselling the dream of Canada\u201d. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My 'normal' was a heightened state of alert</p> <footer> <cite>Garry Woods</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Woods didn\u2019t fall for the promises, which included big jobs in major cities, but \u201cit did sow that seed of curiosity,\u201d he says. In 2003, he went on a holiday to Toronto, followed by a separate visit to Calgary - where he walked into police headquarters and asked for a job. \u201cI loved Calgary, still do,\u201d he says. \u201cI love the big sky. The sun was shining the entire 10 days I was here, and people were so friendly and helpful.\u201d</p> <p>Woods was, in fact, part of a wave of immigrants hired in the early 2000s by the Calgary Police Service to help deal with the city\u2019s booming population. Calgary poached more than 120 officers from Britain, which was targeted for its common language and similar training.</p> <p>Policing in Canada was a revelation. \u201cFor a long time, Northern Ireland was the most dangerous country in the world to be a police officer. Policing there was more like being a soldier,\u201d he says. \u201cIn some of the areas we went to calls with a minimum of eight police officers. We had soldiers backing us up on every call. Checking under my car for explosives, being armed 24/7, not telling anyone what I did for a living ... My \u2018normal\u2019 was a heightened state of alert.\u201d</p> <p>On one of his first days with the Calgary Police Service, colleagues offered to drive him through the city\u2019s roughest neighbourhood. They drove and drove. Finally Woods asked when they were going to get there.</p> <p>\u201c\u2019We\u2019ve already gone through it,\u2019 they told me. And I thought, that\u2019s the worst they\u2019ve got? That\u2019s not that bad at all.\u201d</p> <p>Woods is now a constable on the diversity resource team, building relationships with Latin American and Caribbean cultural groups, and giving presentations to new immigrants like he once was - talking to them about Canadian law, driving, domestic violence, the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and other aspects of life in their new country. \u201cThese are people who may have had negative experiences in their former country with the police,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m here to show them that a police officer is just another person.\u201d</p> <p><em>Shelley Boettcher</em></p> <h2><strong>The advocate</strong></h2> <p><strong>Tima Kurdi, the aunt of Alan Kurdi</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2f0c3e585ed865f9cb934af251c80a30452ea952\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f0c3e585ed865f9cb934af251c80a30452ea952/0_202_6016_3611/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tima Kurdi\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Here, you have a voice, people will listen\u2019 \u2026 Tima Kurdi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tyler Stiem for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When Tima Kurdi first arrived in Vancouver in 1992, a time in her life that now seems impossibly remote, she was confused: where were all the Canadian people?<br></p> <p>She had moved from Syria to be with her new husband, and everywhere she looked \u2013 around their apartment complex, at the printing press where she worked nights \u2013she saw immigrants like herself.</p> <p>Her boss at the printing company was the first white Canadian she got to know. \u201cShe said to me, \u2018I\u2019m going to teach you 10 words of English per night.\u2019\u201d Their friendship was a revelation: they shopped together, got to know one another\u2019s family. \u201cI felt welcome.

At first, she says, \u201cno one was taking it too seriously.\u201d When checkpoints sprang up around the city, Kurdi started to worry \u2013 but she returned home to Canada as scheduled.</p> <p>\u201cThen all of a sudden \u2013 boom. My relatives started to witness terrible things.\u201d</p> <p>The civil war broke out in earnest. Her brothers and sisters soon fled to Kobani, near the Turkish border, then to Turkey itself.<br></p> <p>From Canada, Kurdi helped as best she could. She secured them places to live in Istanbul, away from the refugee camps, and subsidised their rents. In 2014 she visited, and was disturbed by what she saw. Her 13-year-old nephew, instead of going to school, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/06/war-to-sweatshop-for-child-refugees\">working 12-hour days at a garment factory</a>. In Istanbul she went door to door collecting blankets and clothes \u2013 her brothers and sisters were too proud, and too embarrassed, to ask for help from the local people.</p> <p>On her return to Kurdi was determined to bring her family to Vancouver, but the Conservative government of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/08/canada-stephen-harper-processing-syrian-refugees\">Stephen Harper had set strict quotas on refugees</a>.</p> <p>So in 2015, she helped pay for smugglers to take her family across the water to Europe.</p> <p>On 2 September, the inflatable boat they were travelling in capsized.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Alan's father said: 'Tima, maybe the picture of my boy is a wakeup call to the world\u2019</p> <footer> <cite>Tima Kurdi</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Kurdi\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/alan-kurdi\">three-year-old nephew Alan</a>, his five-year-old brother Ghalib, and their mother, Rehanna, all drowned.

It hasn\u2019t been easy. The crisis, still with no end in sight, weighs heavily on her. She opened her own hair salon in Vancouver earlier this year, but admits she\u2019s no longer as passionate about her work as she used to be.</p> <p>When it comes to her advocacy for migrants, Kurdi says that being from Canada has helped: \u201cHere, you have a voice, people will listen.\u201d She believes the country is rediscovering its heritage as a place of refuge, especially since the election of prime minister Justin Trudeau, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/01/canada-target-resettle-25000-syrian-refugees\">honoured his campaign promise to admit 25,000 Syrian refugees</a>. But she still thinks the government could do more.</p> <p>\u201cIn Canada, we are showing the world. The majority of Canadians have opened their hearts to the refugees.

And some nights we put the chair against the door.\u201d</p> <p>In 2015, he and his wife, Cynthia Fidel, decided they\u2019d had enough of the political instability and institutional decay in Argentina, which had not recovered fully from its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/dec/20/argentina1\">2001 economic crisis</a> when it lurched into a new one.</p> <p>So they left their coastal city of <a href=\"http://www.europaworld.com/pub/entry/ar.ss.2\">more than 3 million</a> for the landlocked prairie city of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/oct/21/winnipeg-election-indigenous-divide-aboriginal\">Winnipeg</a>, <a href=\"http://winnipeg.ca/cao/pdfs/population.pdf\">home to around 720,000 people</a>.</p> <p>\u201cOn the first night in our apartment, we looked at the lock and said, \u2018This is a joke. This is not a real lock.\u2019 And I was tempted to put the chair against the door,\u201d Jelin recalls.</p> <p>\u201cPeople said to me, \u2018Where are you going? Winnipeg? Such a boring place.\u2019 And I said \u2018Yes, that\u2019s what we want. We want a place where it isn\u2019t dangerous to go outside.\u201d</p> <p>They aren\u2019t alone. Over the past decade and a half, a steady exodus of professionals (Jelin and Fidel are administrators for charity organisation) have left Argentina.</p> <p>Hundreds <a href=\"http://www.jta.org/2002/07/10/life-religion/features/winnipegs-jews-try-to-turn-tide\">\u2013 most of them Jewish \u2013 chose to settle in Winnipeg</a>, Manitoba, the first Canadian province to set up an <a href=\"http://www.canadavisa.com/manitoba-provincial-nominee-program.html\">immigration program of its own</a> to run alongside the national system. <a href=\"http://www.immigratemanitoba.com/immigrate/\">About 15,000 people a year</a> arrive under the provincial nominee programme.</p> <p>\u201cThe door that opened most warmly \u2013 the most welcoming \u2013 was Winnipeg,\u201d Jelin says. The local Jewish community was especially supportive, sensitive to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/04/death-prosecutor-argentina-jewish-community-angry-distrustful\">disturbing undercurrent of antisemitism</a> that Jelin describes as pervasive within Argentina\u2019s police and armed forces. </p> <p>So in February 2015, Jelin, a heavily pregnant Fidel and their daughter, Sofia, left 30C weather in Buenos Aires for overnight lows of -20C. For Jelin, the move renewed a pattern: his family had left Belarus for a more welcoming Argentina three decades previously.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People said, 'Winnipeg?

Same age. More or less same social profile. Small kids. Also Jewish. Also migrants.\u201d</p> <p>Finding work was not as easy. Jelin\u2019s first job, at a call centre, didn\u2019t get off to a smooth start: \u201cThe first month was terrible, for me and for the people on the other side of the phone.

Relocating to Canada might be one of the unlikelier routes to having a musical career in Brazil. For Capinan, though, exploring his creativity could only come in a place where he felt free to be himself.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m kind of weird, but I wanted to move to a place that was very cold,\u201d says Capinan. \u201cThe opposite of Bahia, which is very hot.\u201d</p> <p>Even more so, he wanted to escape Salvador\u2019s oppressive homophobia \u2013 from the casual ease of anti-gay jokes to the harassment by police when out socialising with friends. <br></p> <p>\u201cBrazil is screwed up,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a country with some of the most sexual and sensual people on earth. It\u2019s also the country where more trans people are killed than anywhere else, especially trans people of colour. It\u2019s very hard to be gay in Brazil. Maybe you can be gay in Rio, but in the rest of Brazil it\u2019s a different story.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>More trans people are killed in Brazil than anywhere else, especially trans people of colour</p> <footer> <cite>Bruno Capinan</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Capinan first tried out Toronto with a two-month stay in 2006: \u201cIt felt like a familiar place to me, like I\u2019d always been here.\u201d The city also gave him courage to experiment with his flamboyant stage persona and vocal tone, and playing with people\u2019s assumptions about gender. \u201cI know it sounds corny, but here there was the freedom to do the things I want to do, while being 100% myself.\u201d At open mic nights, bars and music clubs, Capinan quickly found a supportive scene, including many seasoned players of Brazilian music.</p> <p>Looking back at his first two Toronto-made records, Capinan describes them as \u201ctransitional,\u201d a process of digging into his Bahian roots from afar. But even though <em>Divina Gra\u00e7a</em> features a dedication on its back cover to <em>afro-blocos</em> \u2013 the neighborhood percussion groups, often with socio-political leanings, that are the lifeblood of carnival \u2013 he thinks of it as \u201ca Canadian record that just happens to be sung in Portuguese\u201d.</p> <p>The songs, drenched in that forlorn, temperamentally Brazilian sensibility known as <em>saudade</em>, are about his life and loves in Toronto. And despite production help from Brazilian heavyweights Dominico Lancellotti and Bem Gil (son of Gilberto), most of the musicians are Canadian \u2013 something that pleasantly surprised Brazilian reviewers.</p> <p>With momentum building toward a career breakthrough, trips back to Brazil are becoming longer and more frequent. Increasingly, when he\u2019s out in Salvador, Sao Paulo or Rio, Capinan is stopped by admiring fans. \u201cIt\u2019s very strange for me,\u201d he admits. \u201cBut if one person connects with the music, or my life, and sees there\u2019s a way out of the darkness of being gay and black in Brazil, then I\u2019m happy with that.\u201d</p> <p><em>Chris Frey</em></p>",

          "bodyText": "The cliched threat to move to Canada because of political unpleasantness in your own country \u2013 entirely hypothetical unpleasantness, of course (cough trumpfaragelepen) \u2013 often seems empty. It\u2019s like a stroppy kid saying he\u2019s going to run away from home, to which the standard parental response is: \u201cBe my guest.\u201d For the British loyalists who fled the US revolution, however, or the tens of thousands of black slaves who travelled via the Underground Railroad, or the roughly same number of conscientious objectors to the Vietnam War in the 1960s and 70s, Canada has long been a place of refuge. Nor is emigrating to Canada just about escape. The country\u2019s particular combination of social tolerance, relative gender equality, collaborative cultural spirit and 4.7 quadrillion trees have attracted global emigres for as long as Canada has been an independent nation. (One hundred and fifty years next 1 July, but you knew that.) Equally cliche, perhaps, would be to suggest that each brings a story. But we\u2019ve found a handful of genuinely remarkable ones. Chris Michael The athlete Maria Toorpakai, Pakistan\u2019s top female squash player It doesn\u2019t take long to track Maria Toorpakai down in the Toronto financial district club where she now trains. Everyone nods to the squash courts where the 25-year-old has spent the morning. It hasn\u2019t always been so easy to find her. In 2007, death threats from the Taliban forced her into hiding. Confined to her home in Pakistan\u2019s Waziristan region for more than three years, she spent hours each day playing squash in her bedroom, turning the walls into a makeshift court. Although she was only 16, much of her life had already been spent at war with the entrenched gender roles of her tribal region. \u201cWomen are considered weak, not smart and [are] confined to four walls,\u201d says Toorpakai. Her first attempt to challenge this idea came at the age of four when she burned all her dresses in the backyard and lopped off her hair with a pair of sewing scissors. She braced herself for her father\u2019s reaction. \u201cRather than him getting angry, he just laughed and said, \u2018Your name is Genghis Khan from now on.\u2019\u201d For the next eight years she lived outwardly as a boy. She developed a reputation as tough, challenging boys to fights. And it was when, aged 12, one of these fights landed her in hospital that her father looked to the local sports arena for an outlet for Toorpakai\u2019s energy. It was there that she fell in love with squash. \u201cI just liked the way the kids were playing, everybody was watching them, clapping and they\u2019re jumping, diving, getting the ball \u2013 the rackets are so beautiful.\u201d There was a moment when, after years of living as a boy, it seemed as if the jig might be up. Signing up at a squash academy, her father was asked to produce Toorpakai\u2019s birth certificate. He took a gamble, saying, \u201cThis is my daughter, actually.\u201d The academy owner surprised them with his reaction: \u201cHe said: \u2018I\u2019m so happy that finally a girl is playing sports here,\u2019\u201d and handed her a brand new racquet emblazoned with the name of Jonathon Power, then the world\u2019s top-ranked squash player. Toorpakai spent hours each day on the court. The only female player in the region, she attracted constant scrutiny. She endured leering and bullying, but focused instead on winning tournaments. She climbed to the top of the country\u2019s junior national rankings in 2005 \u2013 only two years after she first picked up a racquet. But with success came unwanted attention, and that\u2019s when the death threats started. The Taliban was active in the region and she knew the threats couldn\u2019t be ignored: \u201cSome of my family and friends, they were kidnapped, some were killed.\u201d She confined herself at home for safety, but did her best to keep training, pausing only to send emails around the world, offering her services as a coach in exchange for a place where she could train without fear. One of her few replies came from Power, the man whose name was inscribed on her first racket. Retired and teaching squash in Toronto, he told her he had been to Pakistan and offered to help. \u201cIt was unbelievable to know that someone like Jonathon Power was sending me a message. A world champion.\u201d She landed in Toronto in March 2011. Power met her at the airport. \u201cEveryone just received me with so much love. Right away we started playing, figuring out my training schedule.\u201d Five years later, Toorpakai is Pakistan\u2019s top-ranked female squash player. Off court, Toorpakai now shares a home in Toronto with three friends and relishes a life of squash, cooking and the occasional movie. \u201cOut of the whole world, God chose Canada for me,\u201d she says. But while Canada is where Toopakai found the freedom to play, she\u2019s adamant it\u2019s Pakistan she represents in competition. Squash \u2013 one of her homeland\u2019s most popular sports \u2013 has become a medium through which she can push for change in how women are seen and treated. \u201cIf I keep playing for Pakistan, then I can inspire many girls,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd they can believe in themselves.\u201d Ashifa Kassam The adventurer Graeme Dargo, one of the last \u2018Bay Boys\u2019 On a February morning in 1981, Graeme Dargo stood in the middle of a frozen lake in northern Saskatchewan watching a three-seater plane take off without him. A suitcase with all of the belongings he\u2019d brought with him from Scotland was all that stood between him and the wilderness. \u201cHe took off and I\u2019m going, \u2018Holy shit, what have I done?\u2019\u201d says Dargo. \u201cBut this was part of the big adventure \u2013 exactly what I\u2019d expected.\u201d Though he didn\u2019t know it at the time, Dargo was in the last cohort of a centuries-old tradition: recruiting young Scots to staff the Arctic outposts of the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company. Dubbed \u201cBay Boys\u201d, these experience-hungry men worked the backbone of stores that supplied Canada\u2019s most remote settlements. Dargo had graduated at 16 in StAndrews \u2013 the so-called home of golf \u2013 and embarked on life as a butcher. Then at 21, just as he was growing dissatisfied with his job, he saw a newspaper advert for young people to work in \u201ca company of adventurers\u201d. \u201cI had visions of fir trees and big lakes, and a very nomadic wilderness kind of life,\u201d says Dargo. \u201cAlmost like a tourism ad for the Rockies.\u201d The small plane actually deposited Dargo outside the Chipewyan-speaking community of La Loche, Saskatchewan, where \u2013 despite never having previously seen a gun \u2013 he took up hunting, fishing and trapping with his aboriginal co-workers. At the time, Hudson\u2019s Bay \u2013 still North America\u2019s oldest company \u2013 was the largest purchaser of furs in northern Canada. Dargo would pay a hunter-trapper an advance to cover ammunition, traps and supplies, and the man would return from a season of travelling with large sacks of furs. Dargo learned to grade the furs and negotiate a price. The European fur ban changed all that. It was devastating to the local communities. Dargo recalls the day an old man entered the store, laden with bags of fur, and Dargo had to tell him they wouldn\u2019t buy it. \u201cHe says, \u2018How can I pay my bill, then? How can I feed my family?\u2019 Oh, it was awful. I felt really badly about that.\u201d Meanwhile, he was doing everything he could to become more Canadian. Curling came naturally to him, and he took up ice hockey \u2013 despite not knowing how to skate. After clinging to the boards for the first season, Dargo finally got the hang of it and scored a few goals. All his efforts paid off in the Inuit hamlet of Kimmirut, when a judge brought him in front of the community and naturalised him as a Canadian citizen. After nine years with the Hudson\u2019s Bay, Dargo joined the territorial government and embarked on a career that saw him become a deputy minister within just 10 years. \u201cMaybe this is a Scottish thing, but I took the words \u2018civil servant\u2019 seriously,\u201d he says. \u201cStill, I was also an entrepreneur by nature.\u201d He now works with a gold mining company to help prepare indigenous people to share in the employment benefits of development on their land. After 35 years in Canada, Dargo is a northern man, but Scotland still has a place in his heart. \u201cThis week, I\u2019m on vacation pursuing a traditional Scottish activity on the land: chasing a little white ball,\u201d he says. \u201cSome things we don\u2019t lose.\u201d Jessa Gamble The pop star Meg Remy, aka US Girls In the spring of 2010, Meg Remy \u2013 now better known as the solo artist US Girls\u2013 was living in Philadelphia and anxious for a change of scenery. In the barely post-recession climate, Remy could already see the seeds of Trumpism. \u201cI could feel it coming on, and I knew I wanted to go.\u201d Something like fate intervened when she was invited to perform a gig in Halifax, Nova Scotia, though she nearly didn\u2019t go. \u201cThank God I did,\u201d she says. \u201cI walked into the club and Max [Turnbull, the pop psych musician who performs as Slim Twig] was performing.\u201d For six months afterwards, they kept up a long-distance relationship. \u201cBut we knew it was right and we didn\u2019t mess around.\u201d That fall, she wrangled an artist residency at Gibraltar Point, on bucolic Toronto Island. \u201cIt was amazing to be on this island where you could see the city, but you were removed from it. I was blown away that that place even existed.\u201d On Boxing Day she made Toronto her permanent home. Beyond love, Remy\u2019s decision to relocate north rests on the classic trifecta of Canadian qualities: gunlessness, healthcare and arts grants. On guns: \u201cIn Chicago, a pregnant 21-year-old woman was shot in the back of the head outside my front door, dying instantly in her pink velour track suit. And one time in Philly, I was at Kinko\u2019s making copies and some guy came in to fax something. When it came time to pay, he pulled a gun and was like, \u2018I\u2019m not paying.\u2019 Then he walked out. It was for $1.70 or something. But I grew up with guns, so it all felt familiar.\u201d On health care: \u201cI would meet people from Canada and be like, \u2018So you can go to the doctor? Oh my God, that\u2019s so civilised.\u2019 When people in a society accept that, it comes with a whole lot of other stuff. Because that means that you fundamentally care about other people. It seeps into all other areas.\u201d On grants: \u201cWhen I started getting interested in making videos, I got a Toronto Arts Council grant to make a short film. I had an idea, but didn\u2019t have the money. I submitted my proposal and got it, which was pretty amazing because I wasn\u2019t someone with a film career or anything. I was just a person with a good idea.\u201d Canada had another curious influence: the experimentalism of her earlier musical recordings gave way to overt nods to midcentury American pop classicism. US Girls began to embrace the sounds of Motown and girl groups, albeit refracted through a sensibility that brought to mind David Lynch, Cindy Sherman and Mike Kelley. A case of clarity through distance, perhaps. But this shift in her musical identity also fits with the argument made by John Murray Gibbon in his 1938 book Canadian Mosaic. Gibbon wrote about how nurturing cultural differences could be done in service of the federal whole \u2013 thereby laying the conceptual groundwork for the future adoption of multiculturalism as government policy under Pierre Trudeau in the 1970s. The idea contrasted with the much ballyhooed ideal of American assimilationism, the so-called \u201cmelting pot\u201d \u2013 so by this measure, in being more American in her music, Remy is paradoxically being more Canadian. Her move to Canada has also opened her up to more collaborative ways of making music. Her sound today, she says, is the result of falling in with a like-minded crowd. \u201cThey were so in line with my taste and so willing to help me, that it was just a weird freak thing. Now I\u2019m making a modest living off of music, and I owe that hugely to all the people I\u2019ve worked with in Toronto.\u201d Her last record, Half Free, was shortlisted for the 2016 Polaris prize, and her next \u2013 with Toronto collective the Cosmic Range \u2013 is set for a 2017 release. Soon after that, if all goes to plan, the US Girl will officially become the most unlikely of things: a Canadian. Daniel Vila The police officer Garry Woods, ex-Royal Ulster Constabulary As the son of a police officer during the Troubles, Garry Woods\u2019s childhood in Belfast wasn\u2019t exactly carefree. He had certain privileges \u2013 a good school, a nice home \u2013 but with them came a life of constant vigilance. \u201cI wasn\u2019t allowed to go near our car until my dad had checked it first,\u201d he says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t answer the front door. I couldn\u2019t tell anyone what my dad did for a job. \u201cBut when you\u2019ve never known anything else, that\u2019s normal.\u201d That\u2019s one reason why, after university, he decided to follow in his father\u2019s footsteps by joining the Royal Ulster Constabulary. \u201cYou\u2019d put on the uniform and be a target,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I wasn\u2019t scared. It was exciting, in a perverse kind of way.\u201d He served for 14 years. After the end of the Troubles, however, Northern Ireland didn\u2019t need as many police officers. Many were directed toward retraining and transfer programs, and one day Woods attended a seminar \u201cselling the dream of Canada\u201d. Woods didn\u2019t fall for the promises, which included big jobs in major cities, but \u201cit did sow that seed of curiosity,\u201d he says. In 2003, he went on a holiday to Toronto, followed by a separate visit to Calgary - where he walked into police headquarters and asked for a job. \u201cI loved Calgary, still do,\u201d he says. \u201cI love the big sky. The sun was shining the entire 10 days I was here, and people were so friendly and helpful.\u201d Woods was, in fact, part of a wave of immigrants hired in the early 2000s by the Calgary Police Service to help deal with the city\u2019s booming population. Calgary poached more than 120 officers from Britain, which was targeted for its common language and similar training. Policing in Canada was a revelation. \u201cFor a long time, Northern Ireland was the most dangerous country in the world to be a police officer. Policing there was more like being a soldier,\u201d he says. \u201cIn some of the areas we went to calls with a minimum of eight police officers. We had soldiers backing us up on every call. Checking under my car for explosives, being armed 24/7, not telling anyone what I did for a living ... My \u2018normal\u2019 was a heightened state of alert.\u201d On one of his first days with the Calgary Police Service, colleagues offered to drive him through the city\u2019s roughest neighbourhood. They drove and drove. Finally Woods asked when they were going to get there. \u201c\u2019We\u2019ve already gone through it,\u2019 they told me. And I thought, that\u2019s the worst they\u2019ve got? That\u2019s not that bad at all.\u201d Woods is now a constable on the diversity resource team, building relationships with Latin American and Caribbean cultural groups, and giving presentations to new immigrants like he once was - talking to them about Canadian law, driving, domestic violence, the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and other aspects of life in their new country. \u201cThese are people who may have had negative experiences in their former country with the police,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m here to show them that a police officer is just another person.\u201d Shelley Boettcher The advocate Tima Kurdi, the aunt of Alan Kurdi When Tima Kurdi first arrived in Vancouver in 1992, a time in her life that now seems impossibly remote, she was confused: where were all the Canadian people? She had moved from Syria to be with her new husband, and everywhere she looked \u2013 around their apartment complex, at the printing press where she worked nights \u2013she saw immigrants like herself. Her boss at the printing company was the first white Canadian she got to know. \u201cShe said to me, \u2018I\u2019m going to teach you 10 words of English per night.\u2019\u201d Their friendship was a revelation: they shopped together, got to know one another\u2019s family. \u201cI felt welcome. You can be yourself [here]. No one will impose \u2018You must be this kind of Canadian\u2019 on you.\u201d Such openness reminded Kurdi of Damascus, where her large, tight-knit Muslim family had belonged to the Syrian capital\u2019s multicultural middle class, and had lived side by side with Christians, Jews and Muslims from different sects. \u201cWe knew their culture, they knew our culture \u2026 everyone was different and it didn\u2019t matter. It was beautiful.\u201d Even years later, when she was well-established as a hair stylist in the quiet suburb of Port Coquitlam and was raising a son \u2013 \u201cHe speaks English, Arabic and Kurdish: a good Canadian boy\u201d \u2013 she still talked to her family in Syria nearly every day, and missed Damascus\u2019s lively social life. It was on a visit back there in 2011 that Kurdi first saw news of the clashes between protesters and the Syrian government on TV. At first, she says, \u201cno one was taking it too seriously.\u201d When checkpoints sprang up around the city, Kurdi started to worry \u2013 but she returned home to Canada as scheduled. \u201cThen all of a sudden \u2013 boom. My relatives started to witness terrible things.\u201d The civil war broke out in earnest. Her brothers and sisters soon fled to Kobani, near the Turkish border, then to Turkey itself. From Canada, Kurdi helped as best she could. She secured them places to live in Istanbul, away from the refugee camps, and subsidised their rents. In 2014 she visited, and was disturbed by what she saw. Her 13-year-old nephew, instead of going to school, was working 12-hour days at a garment factory. In Istanbul she went door to door collecting blankets and clothes \u2013 her brothers and sisters were too proud, and too embarrassed, to ask for help from the local people. On her return to Kurdi was determined to bring her family to Vancouver, but the Conservative government of Stephen Harper had set strict quotas on refugees. So in 2015, she helped pay for smugglers to take her family across the water to Europe. On 2 September, the inflatable boat they were travelling in capsized. Kurdi\u2019s three-year-old nephew Alan, his five-year-old brother Ghalib, and their mother, Rehanna, all drowned. Alan\u2019s tiny body washed up on a Turkish beach \u2013 a photograph that galvanised international opinion around the refugee crisis. In Vancouver, a devastated Kurdi addressed reporters outside her home, pleading in a raw stream of consciousness for an end to the war. She barely looked at the cameras. \u201cI felt like I was on trial because I couldn\u2019t help them,\u201d Kurdi says. But her brother Abdullah \u2013 Alan\u2019s father \u2013 encouraged her to keep talking: \u201c\u2018Tima, maybe the picture of my boy is a wakeup call to the world.\u2019 So I decided to speak up for all refugees.\u201d Kurdi has since addressed the EU Parliament, met with UN officials and heads of state and delivered public talks. It hasn\u2019t been easy. The crisis, still with no end in sight, weighs heavily on her. She opened her own hair salon in Vancouver earlier this year, but admits she\u2019s no longer as passionate about her work as she used to be. When it comes to her advocacy for migrants, Kurdi says that being from Canada has helped: \u201cHere, you have a voice, people will listen.\u201d She believes the country is rediscovering its heritage as a place of refuge, especially since the election of prime minister Justin Trudeau, who honoured his campaign promise to admit 25,000 Syrian refugees. But she still thinks the government could do more. \u201cIn Canada, we are showing the world. The majority of Canadians have opened their hearts to the refugees. Here, you are allowed to keep your culture and still be Canadian. It reminds me of the Syria I remember.\u201d Tyler Stiem The charity worker Uriel Jelin, Jewish-Argentinian leadership trainer As a middle-class professional living in Buenos Aires, Uriel Jelin, 39, felt he had to adapt to the levels of crime in Argentina\u2019s capital. \u201cWe lived in a nice neighbourhood. And some nights we put the chair against the door.\u201d In 2015, he and his wife, Cynthia Fidel, decided they\u2019d had enough of the political instability and institutional decay in Argentina, which had not recovered fully from its 2001 economic crisis when it lurched into a new one. So they left their coastal city of more than 3 million for the landlocked prairie city of Winnipeg, home to around 720,000 people. \u201cOn the first night in our apartment, we looked at the lock and said, \u2018This is a joke. This is not a real lock.\u2019 And I was tempted to put the chair against the door,\u201d Jelin recalls. \u201cPeople said to me, \u2018Where are you going? Winnipeg? Such a boring place.\u2019 And I said \u2018Yes, that\u2019s what we want. We want a place where it isn\u2019t dangerous to go outside.\u201d They aren\u2019t alone. Over the past decade and a half, a steady exodus of professionals (Jelin and Fidel are administrators for charity organisation) have left Argentina. Hundreds \u2013 most of them Jewish \u2013 chose to settle in Winnipeg, Manitoba, the first Canadian province to set up an immigration program of its own to run alongside the national system. About 15,000 people a year arrive under the provincial nominee programme. \u201cThe door that opened most warmly \u2013 the most welcoming \u2013 was Winnipeg,\u201d Jelin says. The local Jewish community was especially supportive, sensitive to a disturbing undercurrent of antisemitism that Jelin describes as pervasive within Argentina\u2019s police and armed forces. So in February 2015, Jelin, a heavily pregnant Fidel and their daughter, Sofia, left 30C weather in Buenos Aires for overnight lows of -20C. For Jelin, the move renewed a pattern: his family had left Belarus for a more welcoming Argentina three decades previously. \u201cCanada is very open to newcomers. You receive a lot of help,\u201d he says, citing free government-provided English lessons and assistance from both Argentinian and Jewish community organisations. \u201cThere are a lot of mechanisms to help you integrate.\u201d The couple now have a Winnipeg-born son, Eliel, to join Sofia, and Fidel jokes that the family practically lives at Winnipeg\u2019s Jewish community centre, where Spanish, Russian and Hebrew can be heard in the halls. \u201cIt was very easy for us to sympathise and make friends with other newcomers, mostly Israelis. Same age. More or less same social profile. Small kids. Also Jewish. Also migrants.\u201d Finding work was not as easy. Jelin\u2019s first job, at a call centre, didn\u2019t get off to a smooth start: \u201cThe first month was terrible, for me and for the people on the other side of the phone. They suffered a lot, I suffered a lot. But it was very good for my English,,\u201dhe says. \u201cThe value of the experience was a lot more than the money.\u201d Fidel eventually found work at the Jewish National Fund Office, and Jelin is now employed by the Indigenous Leadership Development Institute, a non-profit organisation that provides leadership training to Manitoba\u2019s sizable indigenous community, with whom he says he feels an affinity as a Latin-American. For now, money in Winnipeg is bit tighter than it was in Buenos Aires. \u201cBut coming here was about something else. It\u2019s about not putting the chair against the door.\u201d Bartley Kives The counsellor Vania Jimenez, founder of La Maison Bleue In 2007, 43 years after she first arrived in Montreal from Cairo, Vania Jimenez\u2019s life would already have seemed like the quintessential immigrant success story. She had a thriving practice in family medicine and obstetrics, as well as seven Canadian-born children. She taught at McGill University, her alma mater. But for Jimenez something was still missing. \u201cI was delivering babies for women, and then I would lose touch immediately,\u201d she says. \u201cThere was no follow-up.\u201d Sensing that many of her patients, especially lower-income women or immigrants, would benefit from additional help or counseling, this gave Jimenez cause for concern. \u201cI could see they were getting nothing. One day I came home agonising about this, and my daughter said, \u2018Well, do something about it.\u2019\u201d In 2007 Jimenez and her daughter, Amelie Sigouin, founded La Maison Bleue, a house that offers medical services and counselling for pregnant women in need \u2013both before and after they give birth. The house, bought and renovated through charitable donations and government funding, celebrates its tenth anniversary next year. It now serves as a model for other service providers in low-income Montreal neighbourhoods. \u201cWhen I first wanted to become a doctor, it was because I had seen an image of Albert Schweitzer with an infant. Many of the women we are helping here are poor, some are refugees, some are dealing with conjugal violence or drug abuse. We\u2019re helping them and their children to improve their lives. This has always been my dream, to do what practicing medicine is really supposed to do.\u201d Jimenez\u2019s own childhood in Egypt had been idyllic. Her father, the son of an Armenian immigrant, ran a profitable flour mill. But after the Suez Crisis ended in 1956, a spirit of pan-Arab nationalism took hold. \u201cWe definitely felt that things had changed. There was growing mistrust of Jews, and people who spoke English or French. We were Armenian immigrants, and Christian. We were never persecuted. But suddenly, we were the Other.\u201d Her decision to move to Canada, and attend McGill\u2019s medical school, was a simple one. \u201cIt was either that or Australia,\u201d she recalls. \u201cIn the sixties, they were the only two countries that were welcoming to immigrants.\u201d She knew little else about the country, but her \u201cimagination told me that Canada was a place full of snow and ears and noses on the ground that had fallen off after being frozen.\u201d Today Jimenez is also an accomplished writer, with four novels under her belt. They often involve stories of woman-physician protagonists who interact with patients from other cultures. She is now at work on her fifth book, a memoir looking back at the time when she first left Cairo for Canada, which has meant poring over lots of old letters to her mother and a friend as part of her research. They tell of a time when Jimenez was shocked to see young people kissing in public, often quite passionately. \u201cThis is something I wouldn\u2019t see in Cairo,\u201d she says. The Quebecois accent also confused her. \u201cAt one point I wrote about taking the bus, and hearing people speak another language. I told my mother they must be speaking Greek. It turned out they were speaking French, but with a thick Quebec accent.\u201d The province has changed a lot since she first arrived: \u201cQuebec now has much more self assurance,\u201d she says, \u201cit is in far less of a fragile place.\u201d The need to protect its language and culture in the vast sea of Anglo North America, has in the past bred its own currents of ethnic nationalism \u2013 something that didn\u2019t always make newcomers feel welcome. Now, she says, there is less extremism, more acceptance. \u201cThere is a sense we negotiate those differences, rather than try to mesh them into one. If we were all the same colour, we wouldn\u2019t have a rainbow anymore.\u201d And while she wasn\u2019t initially drawn to Canada for any larger reasons, she says being here now makes sense: \u201cI couldn\u2019t see myself doing the things I\u2019m doing anywhere else. My inner earth is Canada.\u201d Matt Hays The singer Bruno Capinan, musician When Bruno Capinan was growing up in Salvador de Bahia, his voice made him a frequent target of bullies \u2013 for its sounding too soft and effeminate by macho Brazilian norms. \u201cI was bullied so badly,\u201d he says, \u201cthat the principal called my mother to tell her I should go to the doctor and get male hormone treatments.\u201d Capinan resisted, though his voice would long be a painful, teasing topic of conversation among his parents and relatives. Today, that voice \u2013 acrobatic, sensual, both angelic and profane \u2013 is what listeners of his Tropicalia-inspired music first latch on to. It\u2019s his voice that gets first mention in most reviews; Brazil\u2019s biggest newspaper, O Globo, called it \u201csmooth, well-placed, unusual, and able to take off to higher altitudes\u201d. Divina Gra\u00e7a is Capinan\u2019s third release \u2013 and first with the full support of a Brazilian record label \u2013 all of which he\u2019s made only since moving to Toronto in 2008. Relocating to Canada might be one of the unlikelier routes to having a musical career in Brazil. For Capinan, though, exploring his creativity could only come in a place where he felt free to be himself. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m kind of weird, but I wanted to move to a place that was very cold,\u201d says Capinan. \u201cThe opposite of Bahia, which is very hot.\u201d Even more so, he wanted to escape Salvador\u2019s oppressive homophobia \u2013 from the casual ease of anti-gay jokes to the harassment by police when out socialising with friends. \u201cBrazil is screwed up,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a country with some of the most sexual and sensual people on earth. It\u2019s also the country where more trans people are killed than anywhere else, especially trans people of colour. It\u2019s very hard to be gay in Brazil. Maybe you can be gay in Rio, but in the rest of Brazil it\u2019s a different story.\u201d Capinan first tried out Toronto with a two-month stay in 2006: \u201cIt felt like a familiar place to me, like I\u2019d always been here.\u201d The city also gave him courage to experiment with his flamboyant stage persona and vocal tone, and playing with people\u2019s assumptions about gender. \u201cI know it sounds corny, but here there was the freedom to do the things I want to do, while being 100% myself.\u201d At open mic nights, bars and music clubs, Capinan quickly found a supportive scene, including many seasoned players of Brazilian music. Looking back at his first two Toronto-made records, Capinan describes them as \u201ctransitional,\u201d a process of digging into his Bahian roots from afar. But even though Divina Gra\u00e7a features a dedication on its back cover to afro-blocos \u2013 the neighborhood percussion groups, often with socio-political leanings, that are the lifeblood of carnival \u2013 he thinks of it as \u201ca Canadian record that just happens to be sung in Portuguese\u201d. The songs, drenched in that forlorn, temperamentally Brazilian sensibility known as saudade, are about his life and loves in Toronto. And despite production help from Brazilian heavyweights Dominico Lancellotti and Bem Gil (son of Gilberto), most of the musicians are Canadian \u2013 something that pleasantly surprised Brazilian reviewers. With momentum building toward a career breakthrough, trips back to Brazil are becoming longer and more frequent. Increasingly, when he\u2019s out in Salvador, Sao Paulo or Rio, Capinan is stopped by admiring fans. \u201cIt\u2019s very strange for me,\u201d he admits. \u201cBut if one person connects with the music, or my life, and sees there\u2019s a way out of the darkness of being gay and black in Brazil, then I\u2019m happy with that.\u201d Chris Frey",

Though by his own standards he didn\u2019t exactly run rampant in the two conference final legs against the Montreal Impact, <strong>Sebastian Giovinco</strong> was still integral to Toronto FC\u2019s game plan. He put up the perfect cross for Jozy Altidore to head TFC back in the game at 3-0 down in a deafening Olympic Stadium, took the corner kick that pulled Toronto level in the second leg, and then gave them the go ahead goal with another corner late in the first half to Altidore in that wild game in the rain. Seba\u2019s patience on the ball and his immaculate technique and timing will be crucial to TFC getting a foothold early. <strong>RW</strong></p> <p><strong>Giovinco</strong>. How could it possibly be anyone else? There are more structurally important players in the TFC lineup, but the Italian is the league\u2019s best player, maybe even the best player in the league\u2019s history. Giovinco can win a game all on his own and he will surely have a say on Saturday. <strong>GR</strong></p> <h2><strong>Seattle\u2019s most important player</strong></h2> <p>Hard to look beyond <strong>Nicolas Lodeiro</strong>. Yes, the pace and finishing of Jordan Morris could be decisive, and Ozzie Alonso\u2019s renaissance in the heart of midfield could be equally pivotal, but the common denominator in both their performances is that Lodeiro makes every player around him function at peak efficiency. Never mind playmaker, he\u2019s been a team maker in the second half of the season. <strong>GP</strong></p> <p>If Giovinco is Toronto\u2019s most important player, for this game Seattle\u2019s has to be <strong>Osvaldo Alonso</strong>, Giovinco\u2019s kryptonite.

Yes, Jordan Morris is a revelation up front, but <strong>Nicolas Lodeiro</strong> is the lodestone for Seattle at the moment, yet another Uruguayan player who has taken to MLS like a duck to water. Lodeiro is more of a midfield playmaker than Giovinco, consistently generating decent chances with some visionary passing. He has eight assists since arriving in late July, and it was Lodeiro\u2019s drawn penalty and conversion which proved the winner over two legs against Colorado. <strong>RW </strong></p> <p><strong>Osvaldo Alonso. </strong>Jordan Morris\u2019 goals have carried the Sounders all the way to the MLS Cup final, but without Alonso anchoring Brian Schmetzer\u2019s side in the centre of the pitch everything would fall apart. Up against Michael Bradley and Giovinco dropping deep, the midfield battle is one Alonso must win at BMO Field. <strong>GR</strong></p> <h2><strong>What TFC need to do to win</strong></h2> <p>Toronto can\u2019t expect to be gifted the set piece goals Montreal gave them in the last round, and the Sounders won\u2019t fold like NYCFC did in the Conference semi-finals. The game might be tight, even dull for long stretches as Seattle work to stay organized and close Toronto\u2019s creative attackers down, so the hosts\u2019 best hope is going to be in <strong>pushing their wide players up from the back</strong> and forcing Seattle\u2019s defense to make decisions on who and when to track. <strong>GP</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"51d692bfeef13bc04b7c5d7cbacad8fc891bff2e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/51d692bfeef13bc04b7c5d7cbacad8fc891bff2e/0_0_3600_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sebastian Giovinco and Jozy Altidore.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sebastian Giovinco and Jozy Altidore.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Young/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Pep Guardiola always says that aside from possession, a team\u2019s biggest priority is defending a counter-attack, and that\u2019s exactly what Toronto need to focus on. The Canadians will probably have more of the ball so they need to <strong>be wary of Seattle\u2019s fast break</strong>. <strong>LME</strong></p> <p><strong>Defend</strong>. Though thrilling for neutrals and fun \u2013 if only in retrospect \u2013 for their fans, Toronto rode their luck in conceding five goals against Montreal over two legs. Part of the problem was the failure of Toronto\u2019s fullbacks Beitashour and Morrow to track back enough to cover on the counter, a failure that was particularly exposed in the first leg and played to Dominic Oduro\u2019s strengths. Though Toronto fought their way back into the tie in the second leg, they did so in part on the back of three good corners. That fortunate strategy may not be enough against disciplined Seattle team. They\u2019ll need a match that more closely resembles their dominant display against New York City FC in the conference semis to win. <strong tabindex=\"-1\">RW</strong></p> <p><strong>Find the connection between fans and players again. </strong>It was almost as if the crowd sucked the ball into the net at times during the whirlwind conference final second leg over Montreal, such was the atmosphere at BMO Field. With that kind of backing TFC will have an even greater advantage. Fans don\u2019t win games, but they most certainly can be a factor. <strong>GR</strong></p> <h2><strong>What Seattle need to do to win</strong></h2> <p>Seattle will feel they have a set-piece advantage and Lodeiro can certainly serve up dangerous balls into the box for any foul within 35 yards of goal. And of course, on the occasions when Toronto commit wide men forward, any combination of three at the back will be vulnerable to a ball slipped past them for Morris to run onto. Really though, Seattle need to <strong>be efficient with limited chances</strong>, and frustrate Toronto to take the crowd out of the game. In previous years they\u2019ve possessed an attack that looks set to sweep all before it only to fail in the playoffs. This year, a modest team that functions well needs to know its strengths and perform to them. <strong>GP</strong></p> <p>Given the nature of their opponent and the fact that they are playing at BMO Field, Seattle know that they might not see much of the ball, especially in the first 15 minutes. They cannot afford to concede early as this might completely ruin their overall strategy. <strong>The longer they keep it 0-0</strong>, the better for Schmetzer and his squad. <strong>LME</strong> <br></p> <p><strong>Attack relentlessly and with discipline</strong>. Seattle are defensively good but not great, and they\u2019re up against a Toronto FC side that scored 17 goals in their last 5 playoff matches. The idea they can shell their way to a \u2018smart\u2019 victory in a rabid BMO Field is naive. Moreover, TFC gave a masterclass on their defensive frailties against the Impact over two legs. If the Sounders can get at Michael Bradley for some advantageous turnovers \u2013 looking at Ozzie Alonso here \u2013 they might be able to slow service to Altidore and Seba and help Morris find space behind Morrow and Nick Hagglund to get in on goal more than once. <strong>RW</strong></p> <p><strong>Repeat their conference final second leg performance. </strong>Against the Colorado Rapids the Seattle Sounders were more conservative than they usually are, soaking up pressure, plugging the gaps and hitting out on the counter. That game plan goes against the grain of their strengths as a side, but given TFC\u2019s attacking potency they must aim to repeat the performance they pulled off in Commerce City two weeks ago. <strong>GR</strong></p> <h2><strong>The winners will be \u2026</strong></h2> <p>The team that scores first. So Seattle in a tight game, or Toronto at a canter. I\u2019ll choose <strong>Toronto</strong> as the home team, and because they have more difference makers on the field. <strong>GP</strong></p> <p><strong>Toronto</strong>. They will concede, no doubt, but there\u2019s just too much firepower, too much talent, too much momentum for them not to take this one. Toronto win 3-2 in ET. <strong>LME</strong></p> <p>With home advantage and a rampant attack, <strong>Toronto FC</strong> should win by yet another gangbusters scoreline, perhaps 4-2. But then again, the ghosts of Toronto\u2019s past haven\u2019t been expunged quite yet. Despite what should be a hefty home advantage, there\u2019s always the possibility Toronto\u2019s attack will go silent at the worst possible time, or for there to be an unfortunate early injury. Football can be cruel, and it\u2019s been very cruel lately to Toronto in particular. <strong>RW</strong><br></p> <p><strong>Toronto FC. </strong>The Seattle Sounders have momentum on their side, but with Giovinco an irrepressible hub of attacking energy and Jozy Altidore in the MLS form of his career, scoring five goals in five playoff outings, Toronto FC will simply have too many goals in them to be stopped. Their victory on Saturday will be a defining image in the history of the club and the league as a whole. <strong>GR</strong></p> <h2>I<strong>s this match-up good for MLS? </strong></h2> <p>Yes. Two big, under-performing teams in solid markets and with fanbases that are distinct and visible presences in their respective cities. There gets to be a new winner in a fashion that doesn\u2019t feel wholly random, but as part of a process of one of these two teams building for this for their entire history. With apologies to Columbus and Portland last year, it\u2019s a much more intriguing game for the neutral and after both New York teams and LA Galaxy went out in the semis, this was probably the best case scenario left for MLS marketing bods. <strong>GP</strong></p> <p>I think this is the perfect matchup for MLS. On one side you have a Canadian team with a great fanbase and three DPs who are delivering, and on the other you have a squad where one of your best players is an American who made his trade in college soccer. Both teams have never been here before. It\u2019s a win, any way you look at it. <strong>LME</strong></p> <p>This is a pretty good advert for MLS 2.0 or 3.0 or whatever iteration we\u2019re at now. Seattle and Toronto were the first expansion markets to fill stadiums and generate excitement around the idea of North Americans regularly turning up en masse for domestic soccer games. It certainly will quiet some of the resentment some Canadian soccer fans feel against MLS, particularly related to the fight over Canadian players\u2019 \u2018internationals\u2019 status and the feeling that the league doesn\u2019t have Canadian soccer\u2019s best interests at heart (which is probably true). Plus, there\u2019s the fact that while Seattle arrived later to MLS than TFC, they have enjoyed far more success in the league. Now Toronto can pip them to a first MLS Cup on home soil. <strong>RW</strong></p> <p>Yes. For me, it\u2019s the most exciting MLS Cup final match-up in years. As something of an outsider I take interest in gauging the growth and development of the league and these two clubs can achieve some sort of fulfilment on Saturday. Played in a newly renovated and expanded stadium (arguably the best in MLS) in front of a sold out crowd, this more than satisfies the \u2018advert for the league\u2019 cliche. <strong>GR</strong></p> <h2><strong>One player who deserves an MLS title</strong></h2> <p><strong>Ozzie Alonso</strong>. He\u2019s had years of watching feted strike forces misfire a few yards in front of him, in the Sounders serial playoff disappointments. And having been offered around other clubs in the off-season he\u2019s seized his unexpected reprieve by playing some driven soccer in recent weeks. He deserves this. <strong>GP</strong></p> <p><strong>Osvaldo Alonso</strong>. Nevermind that he was snubbed as part of MLS best XI (he clearly had the best season of his career) The Cuban Kante has been in the league for eight years and despite all his achievements (four-time US Open Cup champion, three-time MLS All-Star) he is still waiting for his first MLS CUP victory, and this might be his last chance. <strong>LME</strong></p> <p>Though there is a case for Michael Bradley considering the shit-kicking he has sometimes received from aggrieved US men\u2019s national team supporters under Jurgen Klinsmann\u2019s reign of error, the player who deserves the title is one who won\u2019t play on Saturday: <strong>Clint Dempsey</strong>. Twice a runner-up with the New England Revolution, and now out of the side indefinitely with an irregular heartbeat at 33 years of age, Seattle should do it for the rappin\u2019 Texan and future US Soccer Hall of Famer. <strong>RW</strong></p> <p><strong>Zach Scott. </strong>It\u2019s unlikely the 36-year-old will start, but he more than anyone else on either side\u2019s roster deserves to lift the MLS Cup. There before the MLS days, the defender is the definition of a club stalwart, turning out over 270 times for the Sounders over two stints spanning 14 years. Mr Sounder, as Sigi Schmid once dubbed him, has more than served his time. <strong>GR</strong></p> <h2><strong>One bold prediction</strong></h2> <p>I already tweeted this in the semi-final between Toronto and Montreal, but if this game heads into the same surreal territory as that one, then I predict <strong>Justin Trudeau will appear from the sky to score the winning goal</strong>, before celebrating by offering Canadian asylum for all. <strong>GP</strong></p> <p>Inebriatti, Toronto\u2019s controversial supporters group, will <strong>light up so many flares</strong> on the pitch that it will look like a scene from Phantom Of The Opera. <strong>LME</strong></p> <p>Win or lose, at some point in the evening <strong>Danny Dichio will cry</strong>. <strong>RW </strong></p> <p><strong>This will be the highest scoring MLS Cup final in history. </strong>The 2003 final between San Jose and Chicago (4-2) currently holds the record, but given the way these two teams have been going of late (particularly Toronto FC) that record could fall on Saturday. What odds can I get on a Giovinco double hat-trick? How about double figures? <strong>GR</strong></p>",

Football can be cruel, and it\u2019s been very cruel lately to Toronto in particular. RW Toronto FC. The Seattle Sounders have momentum on their side, but with Giovinco an irrepressible hub of attacking energy and Jozy Altidore in the MLS form of his career, scoring five goals in five playoff outings, Toronto FC will simply have too many goals in them to be stopped. Their victory on Saturday will be a defining image in the history of the club and the league as a whole. GR Is this match-up good for MLS? Yes. Two big, under-performing teams in solid markets and with fanbases that are distinct and visible presences in their respective cities. There gets to be a new winner in a fashion that doesn\u2019t feel wholly random, but as part of a process of one of these two teams building for this for their entire history. With apologies to Columbus and Portland last year, it\u2019s a much more intriguing game for the neutral and after both New York teams and LA Galaxy went out in the semis, this was probably the best case scenario left for MLS marketing bods. GP I think this is the perfect matchup for MLS. On one side you have a Canadian team with a great fanbase and three DPs who are delivering, and on the other you have a squad where one of your best players is an American who made his trade in college soccer. Both teams have never been here before. It\u2019s a win, any way you look at it. LME This is a pretty good advert for MLS 2.0 or 3.0 or whatever iteration we\u2019re at now. Seattle and Toronto were the first expansion markets to fill stadiums and generate excitement around the idea of North Americans regularly turning up en masse for domestic soccer games. It certainly will quiet some of the resentment some Canadian soccer fans feel against MLS, particularly related to the fight over Canadian players\u2019 \u2018internationals\u2019 status and the feeling that the league doesn\u2019t have Canadian soccer\u2019s best interests at heart (which is probably true). Plus, there\u2019s the fact that while Seattle arrived later to MLS than TFC, they have enjoyed far more success in the league. Now Toronto can pip them to a first MLS Cup on home soil. RW Yes. For me, it\u2019s the most exciting MLS Cup final match-up in years. As something of an outsider I take interest in gauging the growth and development of the league and these two clubs can achieve some sort of fulfilment on Saturday. Played in a newly renovated and expanded stadium (arguably the best in MLS) in front of a sold out crowd, this more than satisfies the \u2018advert for the league\u2019 cliche. GR One player who deserves an MLS title Ozzie Alonso. He\u2019s had years of watching feted strike forces misfire a few yards in front of him, in the Sounders serial playoff disappointments. And having been offered around other clubs in the off-season he\u2019s seized his unexpected reprieve by playing some driven soccer in recent weeks. He deserves this. GP Osvaldo Alonso. Nevermind that he was snubbed as part of MLS best XI (he clearly had the best season of his career) The Cuban Kante has been in the league for eight years and despite all his achievements (four-time US Open Cup champion, three-time MLS All-Star) he is still waiting for his first MLS CUP victory, and this might be his last chance. LME Though there is a case for Michael Bradley considering the shit-kicking he has sometimes received from aggrieved US men\u2019s national team supporters under Jurgen Klinsmann\u2019s reign of error, the player who deserves the title is one who won\u2019t play on Saturday: Clint Dempsey. Twice a runner-up with the New England Revolution, and now out of the side indefinitely with an irregular heartbeat at 33 years of age, Seattle should do it for the rappin\u2019 Texan and future US Soccer Hall of Famer. RW Zach Scott. It\u2019s unlikely the 36-year-old will start, but he more than anyone else on either side\u2019s roster deserves to lift the MLS Cup. There before the MLS days, the defender is the definition of a club stalwart, turning out over 270 times for the Sounders over two stints spanning 14 years. Mr Sounder, as Sigi Schmid once dubbed him, has more than served his time. GR One bold prediction I already tweeted this in the semi-final between Toronto and Montreal, but if this game heads into the same surreal territory as that one, then I predict Justin Trudeau will appear from the sky to score the winning goal, before celebrating by offering Canadian asylum for all. GP Inebriatti, Toronto\u2019s controversial supporters group, will light up so many flares on the pitch that it will look like a scene from Phantom Of The Opera. LME Win or lose, at some point in the evening Danny Dichio will cry. RW This will be the highest scoring MLS Cup final in history. The 2003 final between San Jose and Chicago (4-2) currently holds the record, but given the way these two teams have been going of late (particularly Toronto FC) that record could fall on Saturday. What odds can I get on a Giovinco double hat-trick? How about double figures? GR",

          "bodyText": "Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has become embroiled in allegations of holding cash-for-access political fundraisers in developments that could tarnish his image as a youthful reformer. Trudeau was pressed hard by opposition leaders on Thursday about newspaper reports that select donors to the ruling Liberal party enjoyed privileged access to fundraising events where the prime minister and cabinet members spoke. Although Trudeau denies he has done anything wrong, the affair raised questions as to whether his year-long honeymoon with voters is coming to an end. \u201cI think it\u2019s already tarnished his image because you\u2019re getting this pile-on of all these stories. He\u2019s on the defensive in parliament and it\u2019s going to continue,\u201d said University of Toronto politics professor Nelson Wiseman. Accountability rules that Trudeau issued after taking power in November 2015 state \u201cthere should be no preferential access to government, or appearance of preferential access\u201d for people who contribute to politicians and parties. \u201cTrudeau\u2019s ethics talk has not been followed up with ethics walk by him and his ministers,\u201d said Duff Conacher of the advocacy group Democracy Watch. The 44-year-old prime minister is on the back foot in the House of Commons, forced to fend off daily accusations of wrongdoing. \u201cWhen will the prime minister finally admit that selling access to raise money for the Liberal party is unethical?\u201d Rona Ambrose, interim leader of the official opposition Conservatives, asked Trudeau in Parliament. Trudeau has repeatedly noted no rules were broken during the events which, according to the Globe and Mail newspaper, included a fundraiser where an insurance tycoon and Chinese-Canadian billionaires were among donors who heard a speech by the prime minister. Individuals can give a maximum of C$1,500 to a party every year while corporate and union donations are banned. The last Liberal government before Trudeau\u2019s \u2013 that of Paul Martin \u2013 was defeated in 2006 following a patronage scandal that helped keep the party out of power for almost a decade. \u201cThe issue of money related to politics ... is one of those things the Liberals really really want to distance themselves from,\u201d said Darrell Bricker of Ipsos Public Affairs. \u201cThe more time you spend talking about it \u2013 and it\u2019s not a topic you want to talk about \u2013 the harder it is to get people to focus on the things you want them to talk about,\u201d he said. Liberal legislators in the House of Commons have looked uncomfortable whenever Trudeau is pressed on the matter. \u201cWe\u2019ll have problems if people think we are playing games with the system,\u201d said one official. Trudeau is in no immediate danger in the polls, which put the Liberals far ahead of the two main opposition parties, who are both holding leadership races that will not end until 2017. The next election is in October 2019. \u201cThe honeymoon is over but the opposition can\u2019t take advantage of it. They\u2019re headless,\u201d said one member of the Liberal parliamentary caucus.

          "bodyText": "Canada has approved Kinder Morgan Inc\u2019s hotly contested plan to twin a pipeline from the Alberta oil sands to the Pacific coast, setting up a battle with environmentalists who helped elect the prime minister, Justin Trudeau. The Liberal government, seeking to balance demands from both greens and the energy industry, said allowing Kinder Morgan to build a second pipeline next to its existing Trans Mountain line will help ensure oil exports reach Asia and reduce reliance on the US market. Pointing to efforts to impose a minimum price on carbon emissions and plans to phase out coal-fired electricity, Trudeau said his government had begun the shift towards an economy based on clean energy. \u201cBut we also know that this transition requires investment and that this will not happen overnight,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019ve said many times that there isn\u2019t a country in the world that would find billions of barrels of oil and leave it in the ground while there is a market for it.\u201d Trudeau also said the government would block Enbridge Inc from building its Northern Gateway pipeline from the oil sands to the Pacific coast. He has long opposed the project, which would run through a rain forest. Enbridge, however, will be allowed to replace the Canadian segments of its ageing Line 3 from Alberta to Wisconsin.

Instead, the country would be represented by the top diplomat already on the island, charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires Jeffrey DeLaurentis, and deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes, who \u2013 Earnest stressed \u2013 was going to be in Cuba this week anyway.</p> <p>\u201cMuch of the US diplomatic relationship with Cuba is quite complicated,\u201d Earnest said, adding that past bilateral ties \u201cwere characterized by a lot of conflict and turmoil, not just during the Castro regime, but we continue to have some significant concerns about how the Cuban government currently operates particularly with regard to protecting the basic human rights of the Cuban people.\u201d</p> <p>The United States only <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/20/cuba-embassy-washington-flag\">restored full diplomatic contacts with Cuba</a> in July last year. The newly reopened US embassy in Havana is one of the few diplomatic missions whose flag is not at half-staff as a mark of respect for Castro\u2019s death.</p> <p>\u201cWe believe this an appropriate way for the US to show our commitment to an ongoing future-oriented relationship with the Cuban people, and this was an appropriate way to show respect to participate in the events that are planned for this evening while also acknowledging some of the differences that remain between our two countries,\u201d Earnest said.</p> <p>\u201cMr Rhodes has played a leading role in crafting the normalization policy that President Obama announced about two years ago. He has been the principal interlocutor with the Cuban government from the White House in crafting this policy and implementing it successfully,\u201d the spokesman said.</p> <p>\u201cHe was actually already planning to travel to Cuba this week so in addition to the meetings he already has on his schedule with Cuban government and officials at the US embassy, he will be attending the memorial this evening.\u201d</p> <p>Other world leaders including Vladimir Putin and Theresa May have announced that they will not be attending the funeral, as diplomatic services attempt to calibrate an appropriate response to the death of a man lionized as a hero by some and reviled as a dictator by others. </p> <p>On Monday, the office of Justin Trudeau said that he would not attend the ceremony \u2013 even though Castro was an honorary pallbearer at the funeral of Trudeau\u2019s father, Pierre Trudeau. The Canadian prime minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/27/justin-trudeau-fidel-castro-trudeaueulogies\">prompted fierce criticism for fondly remembering Castro in remarks after his death</a>. </p> <p>But many leaders of Latin America\u2019s left, including the Venezuelan president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, and Bolivian president, Evo Morales, have arrived to attend the ceremony, due to start at 7pm in Revolution Square, the same space where Castro once delivered rousing, marathon speeches. </p> <p> Among African leaders will be Zimbabwe\u2019s Robert Mugabe and the South African president, Jacob Zuma. The late Nelson Mandela repeatedly thanked Castro for his efforts in helping overturn apartheid in South Africa. </p> <p> Mugabe, 92, himself a former Marxist guerrilla who has led Zimbabwe as prime minister or president since 1980 despite financial and health crises, praised Castro\u2019s government for having trained thousands of Zimbabwean doctors and teachers. </p> <p> \u201cFidel was not just your leader. He was our leader and the leader of all revolutionaries. We followed him, listened to him and tried to emulate him,\u201d Mugabe told reporters as he arrived in Havana, \u201cFarewell, dear brother. Farewell, revolutionary,\u201d he said. </p>",

          "bodyText": "The White House has announced that it will not send an official delegation to Fidel Castro\u2019s memorial service in Havana but that the US will be represented by a senior presidential aide and the top US diplomat in Cuba. The decision represents a compromise, sending representation to maintain the US-Cuba thaw Barack Obama began nearly two years ago while downgrading its status to satisfy critics who argue the administration has not properly held Cuba to account for human rights abuses. Obama was broadly assailed by Republicans and Democrats for a statement on Castro\u2019s death on Saturday that made no mention of the brutal aspects of his regime. The White House has been on the defensive over the issue, wary that it is one of many flagship Obama policies that Donald Trump is threatening to overturn on taking office. The White House spokesman, Josh Earnest, said the US officials attending memorial ceremonies on Tuesday evening would not constitute a formal presidential delegation, as is normal for the funeral of a head of state. Instead, the country would be represented by the top diplomat already on the island, charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires Jeffrey DeLaurentis, and deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes, who \u2013 Earnest stressed \u2013 was going to be in Cuba this week anyway. \u201cMuch of the US diplomatic relationship with Cuba is quite complicated,\u201d Earnest said, adding that past bilateral ties \u201cwere characterized by a lot of conflict and turmoil, not just during the Castro regime, but we continue to have some significant concerns about how the Cuban government currently operates particularly with regard to protecting the basic human rights of the Cuban people.\u201d The United States only restored full diplomatic contacts with Cuba in July last year. The newly reopened US embassy in Havana is one of the few diplomatic missions whose flag is not at half-staff as a mark of respect for Castro\u2019s death. \u201cWe believe this an appropriate way for the US to show our commitment to an ongoing future-oriented relationship with the Cuban people, and this was an appropriate way to show respect to participate in the events that are planned for this evening while also acknowledging some of the differences that remain between our two countries,\u201d Earnest said. \u201cMr Rhodes has played a leading role in crafting the normalization policy that President Obama announced about two years ago. He has been the principal interlocutor with the Cuban government from the White House in crafting this policy and implementing it successfully,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cHe was actually already planning to travel to Cuba this week so in addition to the meetings he already has on his schedule with Cuban government and officials at the US embassy, he will be attending the memorial this evening.\u201d Other world leaders including Vladimir Putin and Theresa May have announced that they will not be attending the funeral, as diplomatic services attempt to calibrate an appropriate response to the death of a man lionized as a hero by some and reviled as a dictator by others. On Monday, the office of Justin Trudeau said that he would not attend the ceremony \u2013 even though Castro was an honorary pallbearer at the funeral of Trudeau\u2019s father, Pierre Trudeau. The Canadian prime minister prompted fierce criticism for fondly remembering Castro in remarks after his death. But many leaders of Latin America\u2019s left, including the Venezuelan president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, and Bolivian president, Evo Morales, have arrived to attend the ceremony, due to start at 7pm in Revolution Square, the same space where Castro once delivered rousing, marathon speeches. Among African leaders will be Zimbabwe\u2019s Robert Mugabe and the South African president, Jacob Zuma. The late Nelson Mandela repeatedly thanked Castro for his efforts in helping overturn apartheid in South Africa. Mugabe, 92, himself a former Marxist guerrilla who has led Zimbabwe as prime minister or president since 1980 despite financial and health crises, praised Castro\u2019s government for having trained thousands of Zimbabwean doctors and teachers. \u201cFidel was not just your leader. He was our leader and the leader of all revolutionaries. We followed him, listened to him and tried to emulate him,\u201d Mugabe told reporters as he arrived in Havana, \u201cFarewell, dear brother. Farewell, revolutionary,\u201d he said.",

Shimon Peres World leaders heaped praise on the three-time Israeli leader ahead of his funeral last year, with two American presidents \u2013 Obama and Bill Clinton \u2013 as well as Prince Charles and leaders of France, Mexico, Germany and Canada, among the attendees. But, perhaps unsurprisingly, Arab states were less keen on attending. President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, despite being a close Israeli ally, did not attend \u2013 nor did Peres\u2019 friend, Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah. Morocco\u2019s king, Mohammed VI, sent his personal adviser Andr\u00e9 Azulai, who is Jewish. Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan also gave it a miss, offering a deputy foreign minister to represent Turkey at the funeral. Perhaps most surprisingly, the Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas attended \u2013 shaking hands with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and sparking anger among some politicians. Josip Broz Tito He may have been called a \u201cbenevolent dictator\u201d but Tito, who ruled Communist-era Yugoslavia for 35 years, had no problem getting world leaders to his send-off. Four kings, 31 presidents, six princes, 22 prime ministers and 47 ministers of foreign affairs from countries on both sides of the cold war came along. One hundred and twenty-eight countries sent political delegations to the funeral in 1980; James Callaghan, Yasser Arafat, Colonel Gaddafi, the Duke of Edinburgh, Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu, Erich Honecker were all there. In fact, controversially, only five countries stayed away \u2013 including Pinochet\u2019s Chile and apartheid-era South Africa. Ferdinand Marcos For controversial funerals in 2016, however, it will be hard to beat the Philippines dictator. Although he died back in 1993, Marcos has been kept in a refrigerated crypt, until this month, when he was finally buried. Marcos ruled from 1965 until 1986, when he was overthrown by a popular revolt, and his martial law, from 1972 to 1981, is said to have caused the deaths of 3,240 people, imprisonment of 70,000 and torture of 34,000, according to Amnesty International. Yet despite public outrage, the supreme court ruled the former leader could be interred in a heroes\u2019 cemetery \u2013 and this month he was secretly buried with a 21-gun salute. Now campaigners have launched legal action to exhume his body.",

The \u201cCanadian model\u201d is not another admiring reference to the country\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, but his government\u2019s success in negotiating an EU trade deal that provides a possible template for Britain\u2019s future relationship with the bloc. After years of negotiations, the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (Ceta) signed by Trudeau and the commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, last month is all the more alluring because it comes without the ties demanded of closer neighbours such as Norway and Switzerland. But those involved behind the scenes of this hard-fought trade deal warn that looks can be deceptive when it comes to judging its suitability in a British context. Though Ceta provides for the liberalisation of trade barriers and customs duties required by Britain\u2019s manufacturing exporters, there is little to match the \u201cpassporting\u201d agreements for financial services that the City of London currently enjoys inside the EU. \u201cIt\u2019s quite difficult to compare the Ceta negotiation process with Brexit because the EU and UK are negotiating the terms of a divorce after a 40-year period of economic, legal and social integration,\u201d said Christophe Bondy, who spent five years advising the Canadian government on the deal before joining London law firm Volterra Fietta. \u201cThere is already a very deep relationship in place between the UK and the EU,\u201d he added. \u201cThe question is what to keep of that, and on what terms.\u201d Inasmuch as anything concrete can be read into a handwritten note snapped from afar by press photographers, this crucial difference appears to be acknowledged by those inside the British government too.

Ironically, Britain\u2019s past insistence of preserving the right to intervene in EU-wide negotiations makes it even more likely that a future Brexit deal would be subject to the same \u201cmixed treaty\u201d rules requiring national ratification in future. Even if these steps go more smoothly in the case of divorce, there is still bemusement among many Canadians that such an approach could possibly provide any improvement on all the trade advantages that Britain already enjoys. \u201cThe Canada-EU deal is an ambitious, forward-looking agreement. It seeks to build new economic ties between Canada and the EU by easing existing barriers to trade and investment,\u201d said Bondy. \u201c But even with the Ceta, Canada and the EU are a long way from the level of deep economic, legal and social integration you get from being an EU member state.\u201d",

          "body": "<p>The Paris Agreement was ratified globally in November. This is unprecedented amongst international agreements for how quickly it has come into force. The Agreement allows each country to decide how it will tackle climate change, and requires as of 2020, regular reporting on progress. Countries of the world have officially embarked in a global race to implement ambitious climate policies that contribute to reducing green-house gas emissions at the planetary-scale.</p> <p>This process is not unlike the Olympics games where countries get together to compare their strengths and performance. If Canada wants to be a medalist in 2020, domestic climate policies must rapidly be adopted to accelerate the low carbon transition. In this context, <em>Sustainable Canada Dialogues (SCD)</em> \u2013 a network of 60+ scholars from across Canada \u2013 produced <a href=\"http://www.sustainablecanadadialogues.ca/files/rating/Rating_Canada_Policy_Figure_EN_FINAL.pdf\"><em>Rating Canada\u2019s Climate Policy</em></a>; a progress report on Canada\u2019s climate actions over the past year. We analysed climate decisions made in Ottawa in 2016 in relationship to the 10 policy orientations that we proposed previously in our position paper entitled <a href=\"http://www.sustainablecanadadialogues.ca/files/rating/Rating_Canada_Policy_Figure_EN_FINAL.pdf\"><em>Acting on Climate Change: Solutions from Canadian Scholars</em></a>. </p> <p>Canada has recently taken two <strong>important</strong> steps forward. In September, the Government of Canada announced a <a href=\"http://www.infrastructure.gc.ca/plan/index-eng.html\">$120 billion infrastructure investment plan</a> that explicitly highlights support for infrastructures reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This investment plan raises hopes that Canada can make the transition to low carbon development, but its real impact depends on identifying and funding infrastructure projects that best contribute to desired low-carbon and sustainable outcomes. In October, the Government of Canada <a href=\"http://news.gc.ca/web/article-en.do?nid=1132149\">Announced a Pan-Canadian Pricing on Carbon Pollution</a> starting in 2018. The price on carbon pollution should start at a minimum of $10 per tonne in 2018 and rise by $10 a year to reach $50 per tonne in 2022. This is a modest start given the Canadian government has stated a central value for the social cost of carbon (SCC) is about <a href=\"http://ec.gc.ca/cc/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=BE705779-1#SCC-Sec1\">$41 Cdn/tonne; and could be as high as $167 Cdn</a>. </p> <p>Despite the progress discussed above, the Canadian Government decision to approve the Pacific Northwest liquefied natural gas (LNG) project is a step backward, casting doubt on the willingness of the Federal Government to address climate change with concrete and meaningful policies and actions. Our impact assessment indicates that this LNG project would be one of the largest point source of emissions in Canada and would increase BC\u2019s emissions by 8.5%. Continued development of projects with high greenhouse gas emissions will compromise progress in other sectors. It will prevent Canada from meeting its emissions reduction target for 2030, and is incompatible with Canada\u2019s stated goal to help limit global temperature increases to 1.5<sup>o</sup>C. <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v517/n7533/full/nature14016.html\">Research</a> indeed estimates that, to maintain global temperature increase below 2<sup>o</sup>C, half of existing gas reserves and one third of existing oil ones must remain unused.</p> <p>Canadian climate policy must tackle the most difficult question: how to transition away from fossil fuels? We call for federal political leadership that steadily and strategically adopts innovative low-carbon tools to drive future economic growth. This requires engaging with a broad range of stakeholders from the oil and gas industry, unions, Indigenous peoples, environmental NGOs, the clean technology sector, and academia. We must discuss how to redirect <a href=\"http://www.iisd.org/faq/ffs/canada/\">subsidies of $3.3 billion</a> away from the fossil fuel industry. Those funds should promote transitions to low-carbon energy and ensure that workers from the oil and gas industry can transition their skills in other sectors. </p> <p>Ambitious Canadian climate leadership is necessary more than ever. Only by working together and building commitment across all sectors will Canada live up the expectations created by joining the COP21 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/08/coalition-paris-push-for-binding-ambitious-climate-change-deal\"><em>High Ambition Coalition</em></a> in 2015. Our federal government has not developed a complete climate action plan. But two further steps forward have occurred since the close of the COP22 Marrakech Meeting.

          "bodyText": "Leading Republicans condemned Fidel Castro on Sunday but uncertainty remained over whether the incoming Trump administration would make good on campaign promises to reverse the normalization of relations instigated by Barack Obama. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t go to Pol Pot\u2019s funeral,\u201d Texas senator Ted Cruz told ABC\u2019s This Week. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be doing what Obama and [Canadian prime minister Justin] Trudeau are doing, celebrating Castro.\u201d In response to news of Castro\u2019s death on Saturday, aged 90, Obama released a carefully worded statement that did not criticise or praise the leader, instead saying: \u201cThe Cuban people must know that they have a friend and partner in the United States of America.\u201d Trudeau attracted widespread criticism for a statement that many saw as too laudatory. Cruz, who is of Cuban descent, said Castro had been \u201ca murderous dictator\u201d and said: \u201cThis tyrannical regime has gotten stronger because of a weak president, weak foreign policy.\u201d Cruz\u2019s criticism of policy under Obama and Castro\u2019s brother Ra\u00fal, the current Cuban president, was echoed by Florida senator Marco Rubio, another former presidential candidate of Cuban descent. Rubio, who has long been one of the harshest critics of Obama\u2019s efforts and has links to Cuban Americans in Miami who celebrated news of Castro\u2019s death, said the president\u2019s comments were \u201cpathetic\u201d. Asked on CNN\u2019s State of the Union about Obama\u2019s statement and that issued by Pope Francis, who expressed sorrow regarding Castro\u2019s death, Rubio said that as a Catholic he looked to the pope for spiritual guidance, not political. \u201cBarack Obama is the president of the most powerful country in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd what I called pathetic is not mentioning whatsoever in that statement the reality that there are thousands upon thousands of people who suffered brutally under the Castro regime. \u201cHe executed people. He jailed people for 20 to 30 years. [In] the Florida Straits \u2026 thousands of people \u2026 lost their lives fleeing his dictatorship. And not to acknowledge any of that in the statement, I felt was pathetic, absolutely.\u201d Obama began normalizing relations with the island in 2014, with the help of Pope Francis, after what many viewed as a failed embargo and 50 years of harsh sanctions. This year he became the first president to visit the island since 1928. The embargo is still formally in place but normalization allowed the island nation greater access to the internet, the export of some goods, direct flights from the US and a likely boost to the Cuban middle class. Critics have argued that the US conceded too much. On Sunday, Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway focused on the \u201cdeal\u201d, telling ABC the US got \u201cnothing in return\u201d. She did not, however, give many clues to likely Trump policy. \u201c[Trump] is open to any number of possibilities,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is open to researching and, in fact, resetting relations with Cuba.\u201d On Fox News Sunday, Trump chief of staff Reince Priebus discussed Trump\u2019s wish for reforms by the Ra\u00fal Castro government, for \u201csome movement or some schedule of movement\u201d on Cuba\u2019s part that would be necessary to \u201cthen schedule some kind of relationship\u201d the country. The president-elect was \u201cabsolutely\u201d willing to reverse diplomatic openness, Priebus said, but before any decision was taken \u201cthere has to be something, and what that something is \u2026 is yet to be determined\u201d. Following Castro\u2019s death, Trump issued a statement that called Castro a \u201cbrutal dictator who oppressed his own people for nearly six decades\u201d. Over more than a year of campaigning, he said both that expanded diplomatic relations were \u201cfine\u201d and that he would reverse Obama\u2019s policy. In interviews with the Guardian on Saturday, academics cited growing US business interest in Cuba as one indicator that Trump would not put relations into reverse. \u201cHe\u2019s a businessman,\u201d said Gregory Weeks, of the University of North Carolina in Charlotte. \u201cHe\u2019s been interested in doing business in Cuba.\u201d Trump has been accused of investigating a business deal in Cuba while sanctions were in place, in the Clinton era. Weeks added: \u201cThere is not a whole lot of interest in rolling back Cuba policy. The business side of the Republican party is very much in favour of it.\u201d",

The last of the major guerrilla movements he inspired - Colombia\u2019s Farc - recently signed a peace deal.

Some were loyalists of Fulgencio Batista while others left with the hope they would be able to return after Castro was toppled. But he never was.</p> <p>Many others believed they would not be truly free under Castro and his communist regime. Thousands left behind their possessions, loved ones, and hard-earned educations and businesses, traveling to the US by plane, boat or raft. Many Cubans died on the ocean trip to South Florida. And many never returned to see their childhood homes, their neighborhoods, their playgrounds, their businesses, their cousins and aunts and uncles, because Castro was still in power.</p> <p>The ones that made it to Miami took a largely, and vehemently, anti-Castro stance.</p> <p>On New Year\u2019s Eve every year, Cubans in Miami utter a toast in Spanish as they hoist glasses of liquor: \u201cNext year in Cuba.\u201d But as the Cuban exiles aged, and as Castro outlived them, and as Barack Obama eroded the embargo and younger Cubans returned to the island, the toast rang silent in many households.<br></p> <p>So news of Castro\u2019s death has long been anticipated by exiles in Miami.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58394f04e4b0da4920d6c5d7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-26T09:02:47.913Z\">9.02am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Meanwhile, celebrations abound in Miami\u2019s Little Havana, where the largest diaspora of Cuban exiles live.

          "bodyText": "We\u2019re wrapping up our live coverage of global reaction to the death of Fidel Castro. Here\u2019s a summary of the main points. The Cuban government has now declared nine days of national mourning and announced Castro\u2019s ashes would be interred at the Santa Ifigenia cemetery in Santiago de Cuba on 4 December. US president Barack Obama extended a hand of friendship to the Cuban people and said \u201chistory will record and judge the enormous impact\u201d of Castro. US president-elect Donald Trump described Castro as a \u201cbrutal dictator who oppressed his own people for nearly six decades\u201d and hoped his passing would lead to freedom for Cubans. Tributes have been paid by Latin American leaders including Venezuelan president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro; Mexican president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto; and Ecuador\u2019s president, Rafael Correa. Russian president, Vladimir Putin, praised Castro as the \u201csymbol of an era\u201d, and the former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev also hailed him for \u201cstrengthening\u201d his island nation. The Nelson Mandela Foundation sent its condolences to the people and government of Cuba, and South African President Jacob Zuma thanked Castro for his help and support in the struggle to overthrow apartheid. But celebrations broke out in Little Havana, the Miami neighbourhood home to many Cubans in exile in the US. And Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, the first Cuban-American elected to Congress, said Castro was a \u201ctyrant and thug\u201d and hailed his death as an opportunity to \u201cwork for a Cuba that is free, democratic, and prosperous\u201d.

Under former president Castro, Cuba made advances in the fields of education literacy and health. I hope that Cuba will continue to advance on a path of reform and greater prosperity. He left a major imprint on his country and on global politics. His revolutionary ideals left few indifferent. He was a strong voice for social justice in global discussions at the UN General Assembly and international and regional forums.\u201d US vice-president-elect Mike Pence tweets: Fidel Castro had a close connection to Canada, particularly with former prime minister Pierre Trudeau, for whose 2000 funeral he served as an honorary pallbearer, writes Christopher Guly in Ottawa. Trudeau was the first Western leader to visit Cuba in January 1976. Trudeau\u2019s son and the current Canadian PM, Justin, was in Cuba earlier this month but did not meet with Castro. Justin Trudeau issued a statement today in which he expressed \u201cdeep sorrow\u201d of learning of the death of the former Cuban president. Fidel Castro was a larger than life leader who served his people for almost half a century. A legendary revolutionary and orator, Mr Castro made significant improvements to the education and healthcare of his island nation. While a controversial figure, both Mr Castro\u2019s supporters and detractors recognized his tremendous dedication and love for the Cuban people who had a deep and lasting affection for el Comandante. I know my father was very proud to call him a friend and I had the opportunity to meet Fidel when my father passed away. It was also a real honour to meet his three sons and his brother, president Ra\u00fal Castro, during my recent visit to Cuba. On behalf of all Canadians, Sophie and I offer our deepest condolences to the family, friends and many, many supporters of Mr Castro. We join the people of Cuba today in mourning the loss of this remarkable leader.\u201d Enrique Acevedo, presenter for US Spanish language TV network Univision, tweets: Not to be left behind, yet another senior Republican has offered his two cents\u2019 worth on Castro\u2019s passing. House speaker Paul Ryan said much work remained to secure freedom for the Cuban people, adding: Now that Fidel Castro is dead, the cruelty and oppression of his regime should die with him. Today let us reflect on the memory and sacrifices of all those who have suffered under the Castros.\u201d Ted Cruz, the Texan senator (and another failed Republican presidential contender), has also issued a statement on Castro: Fidel Castro\u2019s death cannot bring back his thousands of victims, nor can it bring comfort to their families. Today we remember them and honor the brave souls who fought the lonely fight against the brutal Communist dictatorship he imposed on Cuba.\u201d Former House speaker Newt Gingrich - who may be in the frame for a top job under President Trump - agrees with Marco Rubio: Garry Kasparov, chairman of the Human Rights Foundation (and former chess champion), tweets: US president-elect, Donald Trump, has issued a statement about the death of Fidel Castro: Today, the world marks the passing of a brutal dictator who oppressed his own people for nearly six decades. Fidel Castro\u2019s legacy is one of firing squads, theft, unimaginable suffering, poverty and the denial of fundamental human rights. While Cuba remains a totalitarian island, it is my hope that today marks a move away from the horrors endured for too long, and toward a future in which the wonderful Cuban people finally live in the freedom they so richly deserve. Though the tragedies, deaths and pain caused by Fidel Castro cannot be erased, our administration will do all it can to ensure the Cuban people can finally begin their journey toward prosperity and liberty. I join the many Cuban Americans who supported me so greatly in the presidential campaign, including the Brigade 2506 Veterans Association that endorsed me, with the hope of one day soon seeing a free Cuba. Amnesty International has called Castro a \u201cprogressive but deeply flawed leader\u201d. The organisation said Castro\u2019s achievements in improving access to public services for millions of Cubans were tempered by a systemic repression of basic freedoms during his time in power. Its Americas director, Erika Guevara-Rosa, said in a statement: Access to public services such as health and education for Cubans were substantially improved by the Cuban revolution and for this, his leadership must be applauded. However, despite these achievements in areas of social policy, Fidel Castro\u2019s 49-year reign was characterised by a ruthless suppression of freedom of expression. The state of freedom of expression in Cuba, where activists continue to face arrest and harassment for speaking out against the government, is Fidel Castro\u2019s darkest legacy. Fidel Castro\u2019s legacy is a tale of two worlds. The question now is what human rights will look like in a future Cuba. The lives of many depend on it. Marco Rubio, the Florida senator whose parents were Cuban immigrants, tells Fox News he hopes that the Obama administration sends \u201cno one\u201d to Castro\u2019s funeral. In a statement, he said: \u201cThe dictator has died, but the dictatorship has not. The future of Cuba ultimately remains in the hands of the Cuban people, and now more than ever Congress and the new administration must stand with them against their brutal rulers and support their struggle for freedom and basic human rights.\u201d Earlier this year Rubio sought to become the Republican presidential candidate, but lost out to Donald Trump in the party\u2019s primaries. Mitch McConnell, the US Senate majority leader, says that although Castro is gone, \u201cthe oppression that was the hallmark of his era is not\u201d. It is my hope that the Cuban regime will use this opportunity to turn the page for the good of the Cuban people and for all those living in the Americas. Freedom and democracy are long overdue in Cuba.\u201d US Senator Marco Rubio, who ran against Trump in the Republican primary, has said that history will remember Castro as an \u201cevil, murderous dictator\u201d. \u201cFidel Castro seized power promising to bring freedom and prosperity to Cuba, but his communist regime turned it into an impoverished island prison,\u201d Rubio, who is Cuban-American, said in a statement. \u201cOver six decades, millions of Cubans were forced to flee their own country, and those accused of opposing the regime were routinely jailed and even killed.\u201d The White House has issued a statement by President Obama on Castro\u2019s death, in which he extends a hand of friendship to the Cuban people and offers condolences to Castro\u2019s family. The full statement is below. At this time of Fidel Castro\u2019s passing, we extend a hand of friendship to the Cuban people. We know that this moment fills Cubans - in Cuba and in the United States - with powerful emotions, recalling the countless ways in which Fidel Castro altered the course of individual lives, families, and of the Cuban nation. History will record and judge the enormous impact of this singular figure on the people and world around him. \u200eFor nearly six decades, the relationship between the United States and Cuba was marked by discord and profound political disagreements. During my presidency, we have worked hard to put the past behind us, pursuing a future in which the relationship between our two countries is defined not by our differences but by the many things that we share as neighbors and friends - bonds of family, culture, commerce, and common humanity. This engagement includes the contributions of Cuban Americans, who have done so much for our country and who care deeply about their loved ones in Cuba. Today, we offer condolences to Fidel Castro\u2019s family, and our thoughts and prayers are with the Cuban people. In the days ahead, they will recall the past and also look to the future. As they do, the Cuban people must know that they have a friend and partner in the United States of America. Argentinian footballer Diego Maradona has lamented the loss of a \u201cgreat\u201d man. \u201cThey called me from Buenos Aires and it was a shock,\u201d Maradona told reporters. \u201cI\u2019m terribly sad as he was like a second father.\u201d Maradona spent time in Cuba, where he underwent rehabilitation treatment for drug abuse. He met Castro on several occasions and expressed warm admiration for him. Maradona first visited Cuba after the 1986 World Cup which Argentina won after he scored a handball goal during the quarter-final against England. Castro referred to the footballer as a \u201cgreat friend\u201d while Maradona had a leg tattooed with the likeness of the then Cuban president, of whom he once said: \u201cAlong with God, he is the reason I am alive.\u201d Evo Morales, the president of Bolivia and a close ally of the late Cuban leader, said he was \u201cdeeply saddened\u201d at Castro\u2019s death. He told the Latin American television network Telesur: Fidel [was] the only man in the world with so many principles and so many values. He made so much history not only for Cuba, but also for the planet. That is socialism. There will never again be a man or comrade like Fidel, who devoted his life, his knowledge and his struggle not only to the Cuban people but to all the people of the world. As Cubans take to the streets of Miami, Carlos A. Gimenez, mayor of Miami-Dade county, writes of his hope for a \u201cfree and democratic Cuba\u201d. EU chief Jean-Claude Juncker has said in a statement: Fidel Castro was one of the historic figures of the past century and the embodiment of the Cuban Revolution. With the death of Fidel Castro, the world has lost a man who was a hero for many. He changed the course of his country and his influence reached far beyond. Fidel Castro remains one of the revolutionary figures of the 20th century. His legacy will be judged by history. I convey my condolences to the Cuban President Ra\u00fal Castro and his family and to the people of Cuba. Duncan Campbell details all of the CIA\u2019s outlandish plots to bump off the Cuban dictator, including the use of poison pills, toxic cigars and exploding molluscs. Once, he even offered to shoot himself. The Economist concludes that Castro\u2019s death means the island nation will now shake off any vestiges of communism. Observer columnist Nick Cohen has a pop at Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s response to Castro\u2019s passing: Pope Francis is the latest public figure to respond to the death of Fidel Castro. The leader of the Catholic church, who met Castro when he visited Cuba last year, described it as \u201csad news\u201d, adding in a message to Raul Castro: \u201cI express to you my sentiments of grief.\u201d Castro, a professed atheist, was baptised as a Catholic and educated in schools run by the Jesuits, the religious order of which the pope is a member. Always first with the news, the president-elect tweets: The European Union\u2019s foreign affairs chief, Federica Mogherini, has hailed the historical importance of Castro and said the bloc\u2019s relations with Cuba would continue to improve. Mogherini said Castro was \u201ca man of determination and an historical figure,\u201d adding that his death came as Cuba faced \u201cgreat changes\u201d and at times of global uncertainty. EU-Cuba relations were relaunched with an agreement on political dialogue and cooperation last spring. The British foreign office has released a statement from the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson. The UK expresses its condolences to the government and people of Cuba, and to the former president\u2019s family. Fidel Castro\u2019s death marks the end of an era for Cuba and the start of a new one for Cuba\u2019s people. Fidel Castro\u2019s leadership of the 1959 Cuban Revolution marked him out as an historic if controversial figure. The UK will continue to work with the government of Cuba on a wide range of foreign policy priorities, including on human rights. Jeremy Corbyn has visited Cuba several times and been critical of US policy towards it. Here\u2019s more of what he said during a visit to Oxford, where he has travelled to launch the Labour party\u2019s national campaign day for the NHS, he said: Fidel Castro was a massive figure in the history of the whole planet, ever since the revolution in 1959. There are stories of his heroism while living in Mexico in exile and then the boat to Cuba, the march to Havana and the revolution in 1959. He managed to bring good quality health services to all the people of Cuba, good quality education to all the people of Cuba and, of course, he had a foreign policy which was global, but particularly important in southern Africa in supporting Angola against the apartheid regime. Corbyn also lauded progress the country had made in recent years in opposing the death penalty and accepting LGBT rights, as well as the mending of relations with America under Barack Obama, which he called \u201chistoric\u201d. History will show that Fidel was somebody who stood up for something very, very different in the Caribbean and many independent people would say how good health care and education are in Cuba compared to many other places in the world. Addressing concerns that he was overlooking allegations that the Castro regime was involved in suppressing basic human freedoms, Corbyn said: I have constantly raised the issues of human rights abuses everywhere in the world and if LGBT people are wrongly and badly treated and people are denied the freedom of speech, then that is wrong. I have never shied away from raising human rights concerns in any country in the world in any circumstances and I never will. \u201cSad,\u201d says Martin McGuinness, deputy first minister of Northern Ireland, in a somewhat Trumpean manner. \u201cFidel Castro, who has died at the age of 90, was one of the more extraordinary political figures of the 20th century\u201d writes Richard Gott in a Guardian obituary. \u201cAfter leading a successful revolution on a Caribbean island in 1959, he became a player on the global stage, dealing on equal terms with successive leaders of the two nuclear superpowers during the cold war. \u201cA charismatic figure from the developing world, his influence was felt far beyond the shores of Cuba. Known as Fidel to friends and enemies alike, his life story is inevitably that of his people and their revolution. Even in old age, he still exercised a magnetic attraction wherever he went, his audience as fascinated by the dinosaur from history as they had once been by the revolutionary firebrand of earlier times.\u201d The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, has said in a message read out on China\u2019s main TV channel: The Chinese people have lost a good and true comrade. Comrade Castro will live forever. Xi added Castro was \u201ca great man of our time\u201d and that \u201chistory and people will remember him\u201d. He said relations between the two communist nations grew quickly thanks to Castro\u2019s efforts after diplomatic ties were established in 1960. In a documentary aired shortly after Castro\u2019s death was announced, CCTV said Fidel Castro admired Mao Zedong and \u201cregretted not being able to get to know him\u201d. Even though the two countries shared an ideology, they remained distant due to Cuba\u2019s closeness to the Soviet Union, China\u2019s rival from the 1960s, until Mao\u2019s death in 1976. There was a rapprochement after the fall of the Soviet Union, with Chinese leaders visiting Cuba several times. Xi \u201cvisited his old friend Fidel Castro\u201d in July 2014. Jon Lee Anderson, writer at the New Yorker and biographer of Che Guevara, has said: The Cuban embassy in the US has tweeted: Anti-Castro activists are toasting his death outside the Cuban embassy in Madrid. China and Vietnam, two of the few remaining Communist states, have lamented the death of Castro. Hanoi\u2019s state media led tributes to the loss of a \u201cgreat friend and comrade\u201d. Castro\u2019s Cuba showed solidarity with Vietnam in its war against US invaders. The revolutionary figurhead first visited Vietnam in 1973 as a sign of communist kinship two years before the north drove out the US army. As a sign of enduring ties, Vietnam\u2019s President Tran Dai Quang was among the last heads of state to visit Castro, on November 16. AFP reports the Vietnam News Agency as saying: \u201cFor all Vietnamese, Fidel was a great friend, a comrade and a very close brother\u201d. It added that he had been \u201ca pure symbol of true internationalism in the fight for independence of nations.\u201d Ties between communist China and Cuba warmed especially following the collapse of Soviet Russia, the Castro government\u2019s biggest sponsor. China Central Television (CCTV) ran a commentary explaining that Cuba was \u201cthe first country in the Western hemisphere\u201d to establish diplomatic ties with Beijing. \u201cFidel Castro admired Mao Zedong and... regretted not being able to get to know him,\u201d added the commentary, describing the two nations as \u201cgood comrades\u201d. Castro visited China for the first time in 1995. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has extended his condolences, calling Castro a \u201clegendary revolutionary and orator,\u201d CTV news reports. Trudeau said in a statement: It is with deep sorrow that I learned today of the death of Cuba\u2019s longest-serving president ... We join the people of Cuba today in mourning the loss of this remarkable leader. Trudeau also made reference the longstanding friendship between his father, former prime minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau, and Castro. While a controversial figure, both Mr Castro\u2019s supporters and detractors recognise his tremendous dedication and love the Cuban people who had a need and lasting affection for \u2018El Comandante\u2019. In Cuba right now: The British foreign secretary tweeted: UK Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has hailed Fidel Castro as \u201ca massive figure in the history of the whole planet\u201d. Corbyn, a long-standing supporter of the Cuba Solidarity Campaign, praised Castro\u2019s \u201cheroism\u201d and commended the social changes he brought to the Caribbean island. \u201cI think history will show that Castro was such a key figure, it seems he has been with us forever,\u201d he told the Press Association. If you\u2019re just joining us, leaders around the world have been responding to the news that Fidel Castro, revolutionary leader of Cuba for nearly half a century, has died at the age of 90. The news was announced by his brother and successor as Cuban president, Ra\u00fal Castro, who said on national TV: \u201cAt 10.29 at night, the chief commander of the Cuban revolution, Fidel Castro Ruz, died.\u201d Ra\u00fal said Fidel would be cremated on Saturday, giving no cause of death but ending the address with the revolutionary slogan: \u201cHasta la victoria siempre!\u201d which translates to \u201cEver onward, to victory!\u201d The Cuban government has now declared nine days of national mourning and announced Castro\u2019s ashes would be interred at the Santa Ifigenia cemetery in Santiago de Cuba on 4 December. Tributes have been paid by Latin American leaders including Venezuelan president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, Mexican president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, and Ecuador\u2019s president, Rafael Correa. India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, said the news was \u201ctragic\u201d, describing Castro as \u201cone of the most iconic personalities of the 20th century\u201d and \u201ca great friend\u201d. Russian president, Vladimir Putin, praised Castro as the \u201csymbol of an era,\u201d and the former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev also hailed him for \u201cstrengthening\u201d his island nation. French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, mourned the loss of a major figure on the world stage and welcomed the rapprochement between Havana and Washington, while noting concerns over human rights under the Castro regime. The Spanish government said a figure of \u201cgreat historic importance has gone, a man who brought about a turning point in the country\u2019s evolution and whose great influence was felt across the region.\u201d The Nelson Mandela Foundation sent its condolences to the people and government of Cuba, and South African President Jacob Zuma thanked Castro for his help and support in the struggle to overthrow apartheid. Former London mayor Ken Livingstone said Castro was an \u201cabsolute giant of the 20th century\u201d and blamed the US for the restrictions on civil liberties under his leadership. Irish president, Michael D Higgins, said Castro guided Cuba \u201cthrough a remarkable process of social and political change, advocating a development path that was unique and determinedly independent\u201d. But celebrations broke out in Little Havana, the Miami neighbourhood home to many Cubans in exile in the US. And Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, the first Cuban-American elected to Congress, said Castro was a \u201ctyrant and thug\u201d and hailed his death as an opportunity to \u201cwork for a Cuba that is free, democratic, and prosperous\u201d. If you want to alert me to any developments, I\u2019m on Twitter @nadiakhomami. If you\u2019re after some lunchtime reading or viewing, here\u2019s our latest list of Castro pieces: Full story: Cuba\u2019s revolutionary leader, Fidel Castro, dies aged 90. \u2018The old man is dead\u2019: Fidel Castro\u2019s death sparks celebrations on streets of Miami. Castro\u2019s legacy: how the revolutionary inspired and appalled the world. Divide and rule: Castro family torn by dysfunction and disagreements. \u2018He led a humble life\u2019: Fidel Castro\u2019s biographer on the legacy of a revolutionary \u2013 video. Fidel Castro \u2013 from schoolboy to statesman, a life in pictures. The government has declared nine days of national mourning. During the mourning period, all public events and activities will cease, the national flag will fly at half mast on public buildings and at military facilities and television and radio will broadcast informative, patriotic and historical programmes. Former Labour Cabinet minister and anti-apartheid leader Peter Hain, now Lord Hain, said: Although responsible for indefensible human rights and free speech abuses, Castro created a society of unparalleled access to free health, education and equal opportunity despite an economically throttling USA siege. His troops inflicted the first defeat on South Africa\u2019s troops in Angola in 1988, a vital turning point in the struggle against apartheid. The Irish president, Michael D Higgins, has said Castro guided Cuba \u201cthrough a remarkable process of social and political change, advocating a development path that was unique and determinedly independent\u201d. He added: Fidel Castro will be remembered as a giant among global leaders whose view was not only one of freedom for his people but for all of the oppressed and excluded peoples on the planet. The BBC\u2019s world affairs editor, John Simpson, has tweeted: The Cuban government announced on Saturday morning that Fidel Castro\u2019s ashes will be interred at the Santa Ifigenia cemetery in Santiago de Cuba on 4 December. Cubans will be able to pay homage to Castro at the Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed memorial in Havana on 28 and 29 November. A mass rally will be held in the capital at 7pm on 29 November. On the following day, Castro\u2019s ashes will be begin their journey along the route that commemorates his victory in 1959. On 4 December, at 7am, his ashes will be interred at the Santa Ifigenia cemetery, the resting place of 19th century Cuban independence hero Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed and numerous other leading figures in the country\u2019s torrid history. The South African president, Jacob Zuma, has thanked Castro for his help and support in the struggle to overthrow apartheid. \u201cPresident Castro identified with our struggle against apartheid. He inspired the Cuban people to join us in our own struggle against apartheid,\u201d Zuma said in a statement. The French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, mourned the loss of a major figure on the world stage and welcomed the rapprochement between Havana and Washington, while noting concerns over human rights under the Castro regime. \u201cFidel Castro was a towering figure of the 20th century. He incarnated the Cuban revolution, in both its hopes and subsequent disillusionments,\u201d Hollande said. \u201cFrance, which condemned human rights abuses in Cuba, had equally challenged the US embargo on Cuba, and France was glad to see the two countries re-establish dialogue and open ties between themselves,\u201d the Socialist party leader added in a statement. Hollande met Fidel Castro in May, 2015 during the first ever visit by a French head of state to Cuba since the Cuban revolution. Russian President Vladimir Putin has praised Castro as the \u201csymbol of an era,\u201d the Kremlin has said. \u201cThe name of this distinguished statesman is rightly considered the symbol of an era in modern world history,\u201d Putin said in a telegram to the Cuban president, Raul Castro, cited by the Kremlin. \u201cFidel Castro was a sincere and reliable friend of Russia.\u201d Putin said that Castro has managed to build a \u201cfree and independent Cuba\u201d that \u201cbecame an influential member of the international community and served as an inspiration for many countries and peoples.\u201d He hailed Castro as a \u201cstrong and wise person who always looked to the future with confidence,\u201d adding: \u201cHe embodied the high ideals of a politician, a citizen and a patriot sincerely convinced of the rightness of the cause to which he dedicated his whole life. \u201cHis memory will forever remain in the hearts of the citizens of Russia.\u201d Putin also said that Castro had made a \u201chuge personal contribution\u201d in the establishment and development of the countries\u2019 bilateral relations. Countless iconic photos of Castro are being shared on social media. Here he is with Che Guevara, Ernest Hemingway, Muhammad Ali, and Malcolm X. A few years ago Sam Jones, the Guardian\u2019s Madrid correspondent, interviewed Ciro Bustos, the man long blamed for betraying Che Guevara in Bolivia. The full interview can be read here, but the below segment reveals differences in manner between Castro and Guevara, the twin titans of the Cuban revolution. Ciro Bustos was 26 and at his in-laws\u2019 house for a barbecue one spring Sunday in 1958 when he first heard the voice. It belonged to a fellow Argentinian, a doctor four years his senior who was fighting alongside Fidel Castro in the mountains of south-eastern Cuba. As he listened to the radio, the young artist was struck by the contrast between the grandiloquence of the Cuban and the quiet, almost apologetic tones of the Argentinian. \u201cThe way Che spoke, the way he answered questions, was totally different from Castro,\u201d says Ciro, whose recollection of the broadcast has not been blunted by the intervening half-century. \u201cThere was no bombast, no prima donna attitude. It was like talking to your brother, so normal and so calm. That was what moved me so much.\u201d Vladimir Putin has reportedly praised Castro as the \u201csymbol of an era\u201d. The government of El Salvador has expressed \u201ceternal gratitude\u201d to Castro and the Cuban people for help \u201cin the most difficult times\u201d. A statement said Castro\u2019s \u201cexample will live forever in our struggles and will flower in the noble ideas of new generations.\u201d Hage Geingob, the president of Namibia, has tweeted: Newspapers, TV stations and websites in every country will be dominated by the death and its implications over the coming days. Among the key questions: Where will he be buried? Possibly the cemetery in Santiago de Cuba. I visited earlier this year and saw workers renovating the area and access roads. But the resting place has not been confirmed. A guide at Bir\u00e1n - Fidel\u2019s birthplace - claimed he wanted to be buried there. What will be the political impact? Diplomats in Havana do not expect a huge change in the short term, but the death will underscore the need for the revolutionary generation to move on and could embolden democracy activists. What next for the Castro family? Ra\u00fal Castro has said he will hand over power at the end of his current term, but the ruling family have many other powerful positions in government and business that they will no doubt like to hang on to. How will this affect Cuba\u2019s relations with the US? Very little. Fidel Castro was already diplomatically sidelined and unhappy about Cuba\u2019s warmer ties with Washington. The election of Donald Trump will be a much bigger factor in determining whether those links continue to improve. Most of Latin America is still asleep, but as people wake to the news of Fidel Castro\u2019s death there will undoubtedly be a sense of an era passing not just for Cuba but for the entire region. For some, particularly on the left, there will be shock, albeit tempered by the fact that Castro was long retired and publicly said his goodbyes earlier this year. Others - on the right and among the exile community in Miami - have been hoping for this day for decades, but may still feel the loss of a figure who dominated much of their political lives. Castro\u2019s influence in Latin America was enormous, though it has waned, particularly in the last year as Brazil and Argentina have shifted towards the right. The last of the major guerrilla movements he inspired - Colombia\u2019s Farc - recently signed a peace deal. Even in Cuba, his anti-imperial revolution has been watered down by his brother Ra\u00fal\u2019s economic reforms and rapprochement with the United States. Nonetheless, mourning is likely to be declared by leaders such as Evo Morales in Bolivia, Nicolas Maduro in Nicaragua and Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua who were inspired or helped by Castro. There has not yet been any reaction to Castro\u2019s death from the White House. The US, in particular the CIA, reportedly considered or launched more than 600 assassination attempts on Castro over decades, including using poison pills, toxic cigars and exploding molluscs. His eventual death was long considered by the US to be the \u201cbiological solution\u201d to communism in the Caribbean country. But in December 2014, Obama and Ra\u00fal Castro announced an extraordinary rapprochement in US-Cuban relations, promising to restore diplomatic ties and bring the two nations into a more congenial relationship. An end to the US\u2019s 58-year embargo of Cuba, however, is dependent on Congress, where many remain opposed to normalising relations with Havana as long as any Castro is in power. Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has hailed Castro for \u201cstrengthening\u201d his island nation. Interfax news agency quoted Gorbachev as saying: Fidel stood up and strengthened his country during the harshest American blockade, when there was colossal pressure on him and he still took his country out of this blockade to a path of independent development. In the past years, even when Fidel Castro was not formally in power, his role in strengthening the country was huge. Gorbachev added that Castro would be remembered as a \u201cprominent politician\u201d who managed to leave a \u201cdeep mark in the history of mankind.\u201d The Kremlin has not yet reacted to Castro\u2019s death. Former Labour trade minister Brian Wilson said Castro had sent out a \u201cbeacon of hope\u201d to Latin America. He educated his people and he gave them healthcare they had never had before, and you can admire all of that without being an uncritical supporter, believe me, but do not lose the bigger picture - that Fidel Castro, for his region and for oppressed people throughout the world, sent out a message of hope. Wilson led efforts to normalise trade links with Cuba and shared an Old Havana whisky with the president at one meeting. \u201cHe proposed a toast to Tony Blair and the third way, I proposed a toast to peace and socialism,\u201d he told the Today programme. Former London mayor Ken Livingstone has said Castro was an \u201cabsolute giant of the 20th century\u201d and blamed the US for the restrictions on civil liberties under his leadership. Speaking on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, Livingstone said: I\u2019m sure they will, over time, move towards something like a traditional west European democracy. It could have happened a lot earlier if you hadn\u2019t had, the entire time, a blockade by America, attempts to overthrow the regime, eight assassination attempts authorised by American presidents. Livingstone said Cuba could reform now it was not under threat of American invasion \u201ceven if Trump goes a little bit bonkers\u201d. He added: Of course Fidel did things that were wrong... Initially he wasn\u2019t very good on lesbian and gay rights, but the key things that mattered was that people had a good education, good healthcare and wealth was evenly distributed. He was not living as a billionaire laundering money off into a Panamanian bank account or anything like that, he was good for the people. Castro has cast a shadow over Miami for decades, and in many ways, his policy and his power have shaped the city and its inhabitants, the Associated Press reports. Cubans fled to Miami, Tampa, New Jersey and elsewhere after Castro took power in 1959. Some were loyalists of Fulgencio Batista while others left with the hope they would be able to return after Castro was toppled. But he never was. Many others believed they would not be truly free under Castro and his communist regime. Thousands left behind their possessions, loved ones, and hard-earned educations and businesses, traveling to the US by plane, boat or raft. Many Cubans died on the ocean trip to South Florida. And many never returned to see their childhood homes, their neighborhoods, their playgrounds, their businesses, their cousins and aunts and uncles, because Castro was still in power. The ones that made it to Miami took a largely, and vehemently, anti-Castro stance. On New Year\u2019s Eve every year, Cubans in Miami utter a toast in Spanish as they hoist glasses of liquor: \u201cNext year in Cuba.\u201d But as the Cuban exiles aged, and as Castro outlived them, and as Barack Obama eroded the embargo and younger Cubans returned to the island, the toast rang silent in many households. So news of Castro\u2019s death has long been anticipated by exiles in Miami. Meanwhile, celebrations abound in Miami\u2019s Little Havana, where the largest diaspora of Cuban exiles live. It is currently 4am in Florida. The Nelson Mandela Foundation has sent its condolences to the people and government of Cuba. Remember, Mandela said the Cuban revolution was \u201ca source of inspiration for all those who value freedom\u201d. \u201cWe admire the sacrifices of the Cuban people in maintaining their independence and sovereignty in the face of the vicious imperialist and orchestrated campaign to destroy the awesome force of the Cuban revolution,\u201d he said. \u201cLong live the Cuban Revolution! Long live comrade Fidel Castro!\u201d The Spanish government has just expressed its condolences to Cuba, writes Sam Jones in Madrid. In a measured statement released this morning, the foreign ministry said: A figure of great historic importance has gone, a man who brought about a turning point in the country\u2019s evolution and whose great influence was felt across the region. As the son of Spanish parents, former President Castro always maintained strong links with Spain and was bound by ties of blood and culture. \u201cI first met Fidel Castro when I secured the right to export Cuban cigars to Asia,\u201d David Tang wrote in the Guardian earlier this month. \u201cIt was around 1992. We were driven to meet him in one of his homes, as he was very supportive of the Cuban cigar industry. It was a sort of bunker on the outskirts of Havana. We went downstairs into a basement that looked out on to a lowered garden, which was very beautiful. \u201cI arrived for dinner at around 7pm, and he was there with two interpreters, standing beside him, one at each shoulder. They would translate as we spoke \u2013 there had to be two; he talked so much that one on his own would get very tired. We stayed standing up and talking for more than two hours, by which time the two interpreters were absolutely exhausted, so two new ones were brought in. I was amazed that anybody could talk so much. \u201cHe was utterly charming, but quite intimidating, with his enormous stature, military uniform and impressive beard. His speech was a bit rambling and he would gesticulate a lot with his hands, but he was never boring \u2013 in fact, he had me spellbound.\u201d Click below to read the full piece. The Cuban dissident blogger Yoani S\u00e1nchez has tweeted: \u201cOnly a few hours left until the first dawn of my life without Fidel Castro.\u201d Good morning to all of you joining us in London or anywhere else in the world. Today\u2019s breaking news is that Fidel Castro, the Cuban revolutionary icon, has died at the age of 90. I\u2019m taking over the liveblog from Claire now. Stay tuned for all the key reactions and developments from 2016\u2019s latest twist. If there\u2019s anything you feel we should be covering, you can contact me on Twitter @nadiakhomami. Fidel Castro, revolutionary leader of Cuba for nearly half a century, has died at the age of 90. The news was announced by his brother and successor as Cuban president Ra\u00fal Castro on national TV: At 10.29 at night, the chief commander of the Cuban revolution, Fidel Castro Ruz, died. He will be cremated on Saturday, Ra\u00fal Castro added, giving no cause of death but ending the address with a revolutionary slogan: Ever onward, to victory! Tributes have been paid by Latin American leaders including Venezuelan president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, Mexican president Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto and Ecuador\u2019s president Rafael Correa. India\u2019s prime minister Narendra Modi said the news was \u201ctragic\u201d, describing Castro as \u201cone of the most iconic personalities of the 20th century\u201d and \u201ca great friend\u201d. Imran Khan, former cricketer turned leader of Pakistan\u2019s Tehreek-e-Insaf party, said Castro was \u201can iconic revolutionary leader \u2026 who liberated his nation from all vestiges of imperialism\u201d. But celebrations broke out in Little Havana, the Miami neighbourhood home to many Cubans in exile in the US. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, the first Cuban-American elected to Congress, said Castro was a \u201ctyrant and thug\u201d and hailed his death as an opportunity to \u201cwork for a Cuba that is free, democratic, and prosperous\u201d. World leaders have been tweeting in response to the death of Fidel Castro. Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, president of Mexico \u201cI lament the passing of Fidel Castro Ruz, leader of the Cuban revolution and emblem of the 20th century. \u201cFidel Castro was a friend of Mexico, promoter of a bilateral relationship based on respect, dialogue and solidarity.\u201d Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, president of Venezuela \u201cTo all the revolutionaries of the world, we have to continue his legacy and his flag of independence, of socialism, of homeland.\u201d Rafael Correa, president of Ecuador \u201cHe was a great one. Fidel is dead. Long live Cuba! Long live Latin America!\u201d Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, the first Cuban-American elected to Congress, says Castro\u2019s death is an opportunity to \u201cwrite a new chapter in the history of Cuba\u201d: The day that the people, both inside the island and out, have waited for has arrived: A tyrant is dead and a new beginning can dawn on the last remaining communist bastion of the Western hemisphere\u2026 Those who still rule Cuba with an iron grip may attempt to delay the island\u2019s liberation, but they cannot stop it. Ra\u00fal Castro, brother of Fidel Castro and his successor as president, appeared on Cuban state television late on Friday night to break the news of his death. Wearing green military uniform, Ra\u00fal Castro announced: At 10.29 at night, the chief commander of the Cuban revolution, Fidel Castro Ruz, died. He did not give a cause of death but ended with a revolutionary slogan: Ever onward, to victory! Associated Press in Havana has some reaction from Cubans to the breaking news: Carlos Rodriguez, 15, was sitting in Havana\u2019s Miramar neighbourhood when he heard that Fidel Castro had died. \u201cFidel? Fidel?\u201d he said, slapping his head in shock. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I was expecting. One always thought that he would last forever. It doesn\u2019t seem true.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a tragedy,\u201d said 22-year-old nurse Dayan Montalvo. \u201cWe all grew up with him. I feel really hurt by the news that we just heard.\u201d India\u2019s prime minister Narendra Modi has tweeted his condolences on the death of Castro, whom he called \u201cone of the most iconic personalities of the 20th century\u201d and \u201ca great friend\u201d: In March this year, Barack Obama became the first US president to visit Cuba since the revolution of 1959 and Castro\u2019s ascent. He did not see or speak to Fidel Castro, but did hold a number of meetings with Ra\u00fal Castro. After the complicated visit, Fidel Castro published a dismissive response to Obama\u2019s overtures, calling them \u201choney-coated\u201d and arguing that Cubans would not forget \u201ca ruthless blockade that has now lasted for almost 60 years\u201d: No one should be under the illusion that the people of this noble and selfless country will renounce its glory and its rights, and the spiritual wealth that is has gained with the development of education, science and culture. Little Havana, the Miami neighbourhood home to many Cubans in exile in the US, is celebrating tonight (it\u2019s around 2am there now). Here\u2019s how the Guardian (the Manchester Guardian, as it then was) reported the arrival of Fidel Castro into Havana on 8 January 1959. Alistair Cooke reported: Cuba is unlikely to recognise the Soviet Union \u201cor any other dictatorship\u201d as long as it is busy, which it seemed to be to-day, creating a provisional dictatorship of its own. It was Fidel Castro, the conquering rebel, who passed the snubbing remark about the Communists to-day, while his appointed president, Judge Manuel Urrutia Lleo, was dissolving the Congress and the courts and having his Cabinet draft decrees that will abolish all political parties and ban from future office all candidates in the 1954 and 1958 elections held under the auspices of the departed President Batista. The Cabinet announced yesterday that the country will be ruled by decree for 18 months or two years, by which time \u2013 it hopes \u2013 Cuba will be ready for free elections and a go at democracy \u2026 Meanwhile the hero himself, who has renounced all desire for \u201cpower\u201d and is content to be the armed forces Chief of Staff, was enjoying a slow approach to Havana as thousands cheered. For the moment, Castro is the living symbol of release from an interminably brutal and corrupt dictatorship, which was all the more dolorous in that its leader had appeared, not too many years ago, in the liberating image of Castro himself. The press and people of the United States defer only to the Cubans in their excessive celebration of a new Latin American hero; possibly because Castro looks so young and modern, and talks so gallantly: probably because on its face his victory represents the straightforward triumph of truth and heroism in a complicated world. Imran Khan, former cricketer turned leader of Pakistan\u2019s Tehreek-e-Insaf party, has tweeted a tribute to Castro: As news of Castro\u2019s death broke late on Friday night in the Americas, reactions from across the globe are expected to roll in over the coming hours. But verdicts on the man who ruled Cuba as a one-party state for almost half a century have long been sharply divided. Here are just a sample of what other world leaders have said about him over the years: John F Kennedy, 1962 Castro is not just another Latin American dictator, a petty tyrant bent merely on personal power and gain. His ambitions extend far beyond his own shores. Hugo Chavez, 2007 Fidel, for me, is a grand master. A wise man should never die; a man like Fidel will never die, because he will always be part of the people. Nelson Mandela, 2001 From its earliest days, the Cuban revolution has been a source of inspiration for all those who value freedom. We admire the sacrifices of the Cuban people in maintaining their independence and sovereignty in the face of the vicious imperialist and orchestrated campaign to destroy the awesome force of the Cuban revolution. Long live the Cuban Revolution! Long live comrade Fidel Castro! Ronald Reagan, 1986 I remember Herbert Matthews\u2019 reports on Castro before he came to power, calling him a democrat and the hope of Cuba. And to some of you who are really too young to remember this, even people around our country were calling him the George Washington of Cuba, and George rolled over in his grave. General Augusto Pinochet A man of great charisma. He\u2019s brave, Fidel Castro. A politician, with an iron fist. He stays strong. He put his close friend [General Arnaldo Ochoa, executed for treason in July 1989] in front of the firing squad. I would have given him a life sentence or expelled him from the country, but he had him shot. The man who famously declared \u201chistory will absolve me\u201d leaves a divided legacy. Older Cubans who remember brutal times under Batista tend to emphasise the revolution\u2019s accomplishments. Younger Cubans are more likely to rail against gerontocracy, repression and lost opportunity. But even they refer to Castro by the more intimate name of Fidel. Since largely vanishing from public view he has been a spectral presence, occasionally surfacing in what became a trademark tracksuit, to urge faith in the revolution. It was a long goodbye which accustomed Cubans to his mortality. Exiles in Florida, the heart of the diaspora which fled communist rule, are expected to celebrate. Previous false reports of Castro\u2019s death triggered cavalcades of cheering, flag-waving revellers. Latin America\u2019s leftist leaders, in contrast, will mourn the passing of a figure who was perceived less as a communist and more as a nationalist symbol of regional pride and defiance against the gringo superpower. Here is video of that announcement on Cuban TV of the death of Fidel Castro. His brother, President Ra\u00fal Castro, said the former revolutionary leader had died at 10.29pm on Friday. AFP reports that Castro\u2019s body will be cremated on Saturday, citing Ra\u00fal Castro. This image shows Ra\u00fal Castro \u2013 who succeeded his brother as Cuba\u2019s president in 2008 \u2013 announcing news of the death on national TV: Some reaction from Florida, home of many Cubans in exile. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, senior Republican representative for the state, tweeted: While Castro\u2019s brother remains in charge in Cuba, little can change, she added: And Cuban-born former baseball player Jos\u00e9 Canseco tweeted: No further details were given on Cuban state TV, beyond the news that Fidel Castro \u2013 for so long the country\u2019s defining figure \u2013 had died on Friday evening. In April this year, Castro appeared at the close of the Communist party congress in Havana and alluded to the fact he would not be around for ever: I\u2019ll be 90 years old soon. Soon I\u2019ll be like all the others. The time will come for all of us, but the ideas of the Cuban communists will remain as proof on this planet that if they are worked at with fervour and dignity, they can produce the material and cultural goods that human beings need, and we need to fight without truce to obtain them. The announcement was long expected, given the former president\u2019s age and health problems, but when it came it was still a shock: the comandante \u2013 a figurehead for armed struggle across the developing world \u2013 was no more. It was news that friends and foes had long dreaded and yearned for respectively. The Communist party and state apparatus has prepared for this moment since July 2006 when Castro underwent emergency intestinal surgery and ceded power to his brother, Ra\u00fal, who remains in charge. Fidel wrote occasional columns for the party paper, Granma, and made very occasional public appearances \u2013 most recently at the 2016 Communist party congress \u2013 but otherwise remained invisible. Confirmation of his death will trigger celebrations in Miami, the centre of Cuba\u2019s exile community, and mourning among leftwing admirers around the world. For many Cubans on the island who grew up in his shadow, simultaneously respecting and resenting him, it will be a moment of profound ambivalence. Castro died on Friday evening, his brother Ra\u00fal announced on national television. The commander in chief of the Cuban revolution died 10.29pm tonight. Fidel Castro has died at the age of 90, Cuban state television has announced, ending an era for the country. We will have all the reaction and fallout as Cuba, Latin America and the wider world learns of the death of a revolutionary and controversial figure.",

Donald Trump was the first of the two men to react, though the response was a four-word gut-reaction tweet a few minutes after 8am: \u201cFidel Castro is dead!\u201d A fuller response came nearly three hours later, and took the form of a full-throated condemnation of human rights abuses by the Castro regime. \u201cToday, the world marks the passing of a brutal dictator who oppressed his own people for nearly six decades,\u201d an official Trump statement said. \u201cFidel Castro\u2019s legacy is one of firing squads, theft, unimaginable suffering, poverty and the denial of fundamental human rights.\u201d Barack Obama\u2019s statement, issued through the White House press office, came a little after 10am and was cautious and lawyerly, devoid of criticism or praise. \u201cAt this time of Fidel Castro\u2019s passing, we extend a hand of friendship to the Cuban people,\u201d the president said. \u201cWe know that this moment fills Cubans \u2013 in Cuba and in the United States \u2013 with powerful emotions, recalling the countless ways in which Fidel Castro altered the course of individual lives, families, and of the Cuban nation. \u201cHistory will record and judge the enormous impact of this singular figure on the people and world around him.\u201d The carefully calibrated, almost colourless reaction represented an implicit defence of one of Obama\u2019s chief foreign affairs legacies, the opening to Cuba culminating in the president\u2019s visit to Havana in March this year. That breakthrough visit was premised on the desire for both countries to put their bitter past behind them, and Obama\u2019s statement was aimed at the same goal. \u201cFor nearly six decades, the relationship between the United States and Cuba was marked by discord and profound political disagreements,\u201d he continued. \u201cDuring my presidency, we have worked hard to put the past behind us, pursuing a future in which the relationship between our two countries is defined not by our differences but by the many things that we share as neighbors and friends \u2013 bonds of family, culture, commerce, and common humanity. \u201cThis engagement includes the contributions of Cuban Americans, who have done so much for our country and who care deeply about their loved ones in Cuba.\u201d Obama engineered his Cuban breakthrough with Ra\u00fal Castro and had no relationship with Fidel, who remained suspicious of the US leader\u2019s overtures. The day after the relaxation of restrictions on travel and remittances to Cuba, Fidel Castro devoted his regular newspaper column to the anniversary of the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion orchestrated by the CIA, warning his fellow Cubans not to forget. In his statement, Obama observed that Cubans would use the occasion to \u201crecall the past and also look to the future\u201d. \u201cAs they do,\u201d he added, \u201cthe Cuban people must know that they have a friend and partner in the United States of America.\u201d John Kerry, the US secretary of state, echoed Obama\u2019s noncommittal tone, extending condolences and expressing an \u201cearnest desire not to ignore history but to write a new [and] better future\u201d. Trump\u2019s reaction and the wider Republican response highlighted the fact that political repression had outlived Fidel Castro in Cuba. It also served as a reminder that the relaxation of the embargo will be one of a long list of Obama decisions that will come under scrutiny, review and possible repeal once the new administration takes over on 20 January. \u201cWhile Cuba remains a totalitarian island,\u201d the Trump statement said, \u201cit is my hope that today marks a move away from the horrors endured for too long, and toward a future in which the wonderful Cuban people finally live in the freedom they so richly deserve. \u201cThough the tragedies, deaths and pain caused by Fidel Castro cannot be erased, our administration will do all it can to ensure the Cuban people can finally begin their journey toward prosperity and liberty. Senator Marco Rubio, a Cuban American and onetime Republican presidential candidate from Florida, where the news was greeted by many as a cause for celebration, said: \u201cFidel Castro seized power promising to bring freedom and prosperity to Cuba, but his communist regime turned it into an impoverished island prison. \u201cOver six decades, millions of Cubans were forced to flee their own country, and those accused of opposing the regime were routinely jailed and even killed. \u201cSadly, Fidel Castro\u2019s death does not mean freedom for the Cuban people or justice for the democratic activists, religious leaders, and political opponents he and his brother have jailed and persecuted. The dictator has died, but the dictatorship has not. \u201cAnd one thing is clear, history will not absolve Fidel Castro; it will remember him as an evil, murderous dictator who inflicted misery and suffering on his own people. \u201cThe future of Cuba ultimately remains in the hands of the Cuban people, and now more than ever Congress and the new administration must stand with them against their brutal rulers and support their struggle for freedom and basic human rights.\u201d Rubio also called Obama\u2019s statement \u201cpathetic\u201d and criticised the statement issued by Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau. The Florida governor Rick Scott and a spokesman for Miami Dade County mayor Carlos Gimenez reported conversations with Trump about Castro\u2019s death and Cuba policy. Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader from Kentucky, also put the onus on the Ra\u00fal Castro regime to make radical political changes in the wake of Fidel\u2019s death, although he made no explicit threat of renewed sanctions. \u201cWhile Fidel Castro is gone, sadly the oppression that was the hallmark of his era is not,\u201d McConnell said in a statement. \u201cIt is my hope that the Cuban regime will use this opportunity to turn the page for the good of the Cuban people and for all those living in the Americas.

The UK foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, said: \u201cFidel Castro\u2019s death marks the end of an era for Cuba and the start of a new one for Cuba\u2019s people.\u201d In a measured statement released on Saturday morning, Spain\u2019s foreign ministry said: \u201cA figure of great historic importance has gone, a man who brought about a turning point in the country\u2019s evolution and whose great influence was felt across the region. As the son of Spanish parents, former President Castro always maintained strong links with Spain and was bound by ties of blood and culture.\u201d Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, was more lavish with his condolences, calling Castro a \u201clegendary revolutionary and orator\u201d. In a statement, he added: \u201cIt is with deep sorrow that I learned today of the death of Cuba\u2019s longest-serving president \u2026 We join the people of Cuba today in mourning the loss of this remarkable leader. Trudeau also made reference the longstanding friendship between his father, former prime minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau, and Castro: \u201cWhile a controversial figure, both Mr Castro\u2019s supporters and detractors recognise his tremendous dedication and love the Cuban people who had a need and lasting affection for El Comandante.\u201d The Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, described the news as tragic, adding: \u201cFidel Castro was one of the most iconic personalities of the 20th century. India mourns the loss of a great friend. I extend my deepest condolences to the government and people of Cuba on the sad demise of Fidel Castro. May his soul rest in peace.\u201d Eulogies to El Comandante also came thick and fast from across Africa. From Algiers to Cape Town, Fidel Castro is remembered not as a dictator but as a friend, ally and, in some places, a saviour. Cuba under Castro fiercely opposed South Africa\u2019s apartheid regime and its western backers, and supported the African National Congress, the most prominent party in the nation\u2019s liberation struggle. Nelson Mandela, the ANC leader and first president of post-apartheid South Africa, was a deep admirer. \u201cComrade Castro\u2019s leadership remains an inspiration to revolutionary movements committed to social justice worldwide,\u201d the ANC said on Saturday. Jacob Zuma, the beleaguered ANC and South African president, said that Castro had dedicated his life to \u201cthe freedom of other oppressed people around the world\u201d. In the 1970s and 1980s, Cuban troops played a critical and bloody role on Cold War battlefields in Angola and Ethiopia that has never been forgotten in the region. The independence of Angola from Portugal in 1975, obtained with the aid of Cuban forces, removed a key ally of South African rulers that they saw as a buffer against majority rule and socialism. Castro was convinced that the global stage for the world revolution was Africa. \u201cThe African liberation movement owes you a huge gift of gratitude, said Charles Onyango-Obbo, a Kenyan columnist and publisher on Twitter. In Algeria, one of the first destinations of the tens of thousands of Cuban doctors who worked on the frontline of cold war conflicts and in developing nations from the early 1960s onwards, Castro was remembered as a \u201cgreat friend of the Algerian people\u201d.",

During my presidency, we have worked hard to put the past behind us, pursuing a future in which the relationship between our two countries is defined not by our differences but by the many things that we share as neighbours and friends \u2013 bonds of family, culture, commerce and common humanity. This engagement includes the contributions of Cuban Americans, who have done so much for our country and who care deeply about their loved ones in Cuba.<br></p> <p>Today, we offer condolences to Fidel Castro\u2019s family, and our thoughts and prayers are with the Cuban people.

          "bodyText": "World leaders have been giving their reactions to the announcement that former Cuban president Fidel Castro has died at the age of 90. Barack Obama, US president At this time of Fidel Castro\u2019s passing, we extend a hand of friendship to the Cuban people. We know that this moment fills Cubans \u2013 in Cuba and in the United States \u2013 with powerful emotions, recalling the countless ways in which Fidel Castro altered the course of individual lives, families, and of the Cuban nation. History will record and judge the enormous impact of this singular figure on the people and world around him. \u200eFor nearly six decades, the relationship between the United States and Cuba was marked by discord and profound political disagreements. During my presidency, we have worked hard to put the past behind us, pursuing a future in which the relationship between our two countries is defined not by our differences but by the many things that we share as neighbours and friends \u2013 bonds of family, culture, commerce and common humanity. This engagement includes the contributions of Cuban Americans, who have done so much for our country and who care deeply about their loved ones in Cuba. Today, we offer condolences to Fidel Castro\u2019s family, and our thoughts and prayers are with the Cuban people. In the days ahead, they will recall the past and also look to the future. As they do, the Cuban people must know that they have a friend and partner in the United States of America.\u201d Donald Trump, US president-elect: Today, the world marks the passing of a brutal dictator who oppressed his own people for nearly six decades. Fidel Castro\u2019s legacy is one of firing squads, theft, unimaginable suffering, poverty and the denial of fundamental human rights. While Cuba remains a totalitarian island, it is my hope that today marks a move away from the horrors endured for too long, and toward a future in which the wonderful Cuban people finally live in the freedom they so richly deserve. Though the tragedies, deaths and pain caused by Fidel Castro cannot be erased, our administration will do all it can to ensure the Cuban people can finally begin their journey toward prosperity and liberty. I join the many Cuban Americans who supported me so greatly in the presidential campaign, including the Brigade 2506 Veterans Association that endorsed me, with the hope of one day soon seeing a free Cuba.\u201d Vladimir Putin, president of Russia: Fidel Castro was a sincere and reliable friend of Russia. He embodied the high ideals of a politician, a citizen and a patriot sincerely, convinced of the rightness of the cause to which he dedicated his whole life. His memory will forever remain in the hearts of the citizens of Russia.\u201d Xi Jinping, president of China: The Chinese people have lost a good and true comrade. Comrade Castro will live forever.\u201d Mikhail Gorbachev, former leader of the Soviet Union: Fidel stood up and strengthened his country during the harshest American blockade, when there was colossal pressure on him, and he still took his country out of this blockade to a path of independent development. In the past years, even when Fidel Castro was not formally in power, his role in strengthening the country was huge.\u201d Pope Francis: In a message to Fidel Castro\u2019s brother Raul: \u201cI express to you my sentiments of grief.\u201d Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the UK opposition: [He was] a massive figure in the history of the whole planet. History will show that Fidel was somebody who stood up for something very, very different in the Caribbean and many independent people would say how good healthcare and education are in Cuba compared with many other places in the world.\u201d Boris Johnson, UK foreign secretary: Fidel Castro\u2019s death marks the end of an era for Cuba and the start of a new one for Cuba\u2019s people.\u201d Justin Trudeau, prime minister of Canada We join the people of Cuba today in mourning the loss of this remarkable leader.

Roads and bridges are crumbling and congested with traffic. Subways and buses overcrowded and underfunded. We need a roll-out of emissions-reducing initiatives to avert catastrophic climate change, and a build-up of defences to protect ourselves from floods and fires already locked in. </p> <p>But many will question the Liberals plan to deal with it: selling off existing public assets to raise money, and having private investors fund, build and operate new infrastructure. If they get their way, expect a wave of privatizations\u2014targeting public services and goods like roads, ports, <a href=\"https://www.thestar.com/opinion/commentary/2016/10/27/privatizing-airports-a-flight-risk-mcquaig.html\">airports</a>, utilities, the post office, and more. According to Adam Vaughan, one of its Liberal architects, there simply <a href=\"http://www.ctvnews.ca/business/opposition-to-private-sector-cash-in-infrastructure-is-stupid-liberal-mp-says-1.3164699?hootPostID=46b8e2197807bdff38e1bdf6f367459b\">isn\u2019t</a> an alternative: \u201cto be afraid of the private sector when you\u2019re trying to fix this country\u2019s infrastructure is shortsighted\u2026stupid, irresponsible.\u201d</p> <p>By responsible and far-sighted, does Vaughan mean the <a href=\"https://www.policyalternatives.ca/sites/default/files/uploads/publications/Saskatchewan%20Office/2015/11/Privatization%20Nation%20%2811-05-15%29.pdf\">result</a> of past Canadian experiments in privatization? Unsafely constructed schools. Packed, dangerous prisons. Water treatment systems flooded with sewage. Super hospitals built with faulty wiring in emergency rooms. Senior care homes over-run with inedible food and filth.</p> <p>The politicians prattle about the private sector covering the risk of projects: the enabling lie that cannot for its life find evidence. Time and again, the costs of these public-private partnerships have instead been borne by the public. In Ontario over the last decade alone, their cost-overruns <a href=\"https://www.policyalternatives.ca/publications/monitor/ontario-audit-throws-cold-water-federal-provincial-love-affair-p3s\">burdened</a> citizens with an extra $8bn and racked up $30bn in public liabilities\u2014the equivalent of $6000 per household. But perhaps Canadians are just too stupid to understand their merits. Stupid enough that 75 percent of them surveyed now <a href=\"http://www.torontosun.com/2016/11/14/public-support-for-public-private-partnerships-plummets-poll?utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=recommend-button&amp;utm_campaign=Public+support+for+public-private+partnerships+plummets%3A+Poll\">oppose</a> such privatization schemes. So stupid, indeed, that in many cases they have clamoured successfully for these services to be returned to public control.</p> <p>Trudeau\u2019s plan for a privatization bank would expand these local disasters to a national scale. Corporate and pension-fund backers have already <a href=\"http://www.torontosun.com/2016/11/18/tom-parkin-without-any-mandate-trudeau-pushes-privatization\">announced</a> they expect returns of 7 to 9 percent on their investments. How do you think that will happen? The only way that skimping ever does: higher bills, user fees, and hidden government subsidies. Diminishment in quality of service. Cuts in jobs and pay. No wonder some of Trudeau\u2019s corporate advisors are offering their helpful advice free of charge: it\u2019s regular people who will end up carrying the cost.</p> <p>These costs are not an oversight of privatization but their objective: the inevitable result of opening up the public sphere to private profit-making. For more than thirty years in Canada, such measures have been a tool of an elite agenda promoted by successive Liberal and Tory governments: the transfer of wealth from the poorer to the wealthy, from the public trust to the private clutch. Is it any wonder why most people\u2019s incomes and standard of living have <a href=\"https://www.policyalternatives.ca/sites/default/files/uploads/publications/National%20Office/2010/12/Richest%201%20Percent.pdf\">stagnated</a>, while those of millionaires has skyrocketed?</p> <p>So it\u2019s not surprise that Trudeau doesn\u2019t dare call privatization by its name. Instead his Ministers have invented hip, ambiguous names like \u201casset recycling\u201d and the \u201cflywheel of reinvestment\u201d to describe their proposed schemes. And the public opposition might explain how the Liberals\u2019 proclivity for consultations hasn\u2019t extended to this matter. </p> <p>Because privatization serves the elite, it always spawns contempt for democracy.

One slide describing the obstacles to privatization is entitled \u201cInherent diseases.\u201d The obstacles? \u201cStakeholders,\u201d \u201ctransparency,\u201d and \u201cpublic justification.\u201d For corporations chasing endless profits, the basic value of democracy are not essential to a healthy, thriving society. They are a scourge to be avoided.</p> <p>All this secrecy, euphemism and dismissive rhetoric is meant to obscure a single, glaring fact: the arguments in favour of privatization are rubbish. There is no need to privatize public assets: with government borrowing rates at historic lows, the Liberals could simply take out loans and build infrastructure at a fraction of the cost. And forget the notion that we\u2019re broke. This line is regularly peddled by the political and corporate class to distract from the cash, much of it accumulated through tax cuts, <a href=\"https://www.pressprogress.ca/corporate_canada_is_sitting_on_680_billion_85_canadians_say_raise_corporate_taxes\">hoarded</a> by Canadian corporations: at the end of 2015, a stunning $600bn. </p> <p>You\u2019d think that Trudeau\u2019s anti-austerity pledge, so crucial to his election, would have meant putting our hands on some of these obscene corporate profits.

          "bodyText": "While prime minister Justin Trudeau flogged our public assets last week, he had a soothing message: rest assured, we\u2019ll be well-served by the private sector. Bankers and billionaires lined up to sound a note of confidence. \u201cI think it\u2019s unprecedented,\u201d exclaimed Canada\u2019s top business lobbyist John Manley. \u201cA once-in-a-generation opportunity,\u201d enthused Trudeau\u2019s economic advisory council. These corporate figures are rubbing their hands because Trudeau is about to put one of our great crises in their hands: the need for historic investment in the country\u2019s infrastructure, for so long the domain of the state. No one will deny the urgency. Roads and bridges are crumbling and congested with traffic. Subways and buses overcrowded and underfunded. We need a roll-out of emissions-reducing initiatives to avert catastrophic climate change, and a build-up of defences to protect ourselves from floods and fires already locked in. But many will question the Liberals plan to deal with it: selling off existing public assets to raise money, and having private investors fund, build and operate new infrastructure. If they get their way, expect a wave of privatizations\u2014targeting public services and goods like roads, ports, airports, utilities, the post office, and more.

Trump's son-in-law at center of transition team drama</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>One of the key men behind Donald Trump\u2019s transition to power is a 35-year-old real estate mogul, businessman and publisher called Jared Kushner. He is also married to Trump\u2019s influential daughter Ivanka, and is in line to be arguably the most powerful son-in-law to ever set foot in the White House.</p> <p>During the latter stages of the campaign it was Kushner who effectively functioned as Trump\u2019s campaign manger. He advised him on strategy, drafted his speeches and ran the candidate\u2019s digital media campaign.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0297cea684d617ac651856871f3d68c3bfa42c62\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0297cea684d617ac651856871f3d68c3bfa42c62/0_59_3234_1940/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jared Kushner.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jared Kushner.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carolyn Kaster/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But eight days after Trump\u2019s unexpected victory, Kushner is now at the centre of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/15/donald-trump-transition-team-disarray-adviser-purge\">a messy and Shakespearean body-strewn transition process</a>, variously described as infighting, a \u201cStalinist purge\u201d, and a \u201cknife fight\u201d. On Friday, New Jersey governor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/11/chris-christie-dropped-trump-transition-team\">Chris Christie was abruptly sacked as head of the transition team</a> and replaced with Trump\u2019s vice-president-elect, Mike Pence.</p> <p>Christie\u2019s ousting is thought to be the result of a feud with Kushner. As a federal prosecutor, Christie prosecuted Kushner\u2019s father, Charles, who was convicted and jailed on charges of tax evasion, witness tampering and illegal campaign contributions. He got two years in jail, and was released after one. While he was in jail, Kushner took over the running of his father\u2019s property business.</p> <p>Earlier this week, two more senior members of Trump\u2019s team were sacked. They were Mike Rogers, who had been handling national security, and Matthew Freedman, a lobbyist and liaison with business and foreign governments. Both were allies of Christie.</p> <p>Good-looking, tall and patrician, Kushner studied at Harvard and New York universities. (According to Daniel Golden, author of The Price of Admissions: How America\u2019s Ruling Class Buys Its Way into Elite Colleges, he was admitted to Harvard after his father donated $2.5m to the university.) At age 26, he was conducting his own mega-deals. In 2007, he bought an office building on Fifth Avenue for a record $1.8bn. Most of the cash involved in the acquisition was borrowed.<br></p> <p>Kushner has one characteristic which sets him apart from Trump\u2019s alt-right entourage: he\u2019s Jewish. (Ivanka Trump converted to Judaism when they married in 2009; the couple have three children who they\u2019re raising as Orthodox Jews.) Kushner has defended his father-in-law against persistent accusations of antisemitism, including in a notable piece published by the New York Observer, which he owns.<br></p> <p>Trump has described his son-in-law as a \u201cgreat guy\u201d. The president-elect has also reportedly taken the unprecedented step of requesting security clearance for Kushner to attend top-secret presidential briefings, the first one of which was on Tuesday. It\u2019s unclear if the request will be approved. It marks an astonishing departure and invites the accusation of nepotism.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/16/jared-kushner-ivanka-trump-transition-team-chris-christie\">Who is Jared Kushner?

Thanks to Todd Gillman of the Dallas News. PE stands for president-elect and VPE stands for vice-president-elect. </p> <p>Question on the perceived slow pace of personnel announcements and decisions:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The PE and the VPE are taking a very structured methodical approach to this\u2026.We\u2019re not going to rush.\u2026 We\u2019re going to make sure that they\u2019re people that we are confident will pass confirmation and they\u2019re going to be people that we think can implement the PE\u2019s vision. It\u2019s also important to look back that President Obama even didn\u2019t have his entire cabinet formed in the first week. We\u2019re going to make sure we get it right.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Question: Will you announce national security team first?</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When the PE is ready to put that forward then we will.\u201d (no timetable who will be announced before others.) \u201cObviously we\u2019re taking this very seriously and we know we have a finite amount of time to get this put together\u2026. Inside, there\u2019s a very solid plan. There\u2019s a methodical approach to all this being put together. [despite news reports] \u2026 It\u2019s very calm, it\u2019s very structured and anyone saying anything else is either A, bitter, because they\u2019re not on the inside and they\u2019re not being considered, or they\u2019re someone who\u2019s just bitter because the election was last week and they didn\u2019t get the result that they wanted. \u2026 The PE will be putting forward some very fine people. It\u2019ll be some folks who\u2019ll be outside the box. There will be some people who have been very successful in fields of business, in fields of education.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Question on reports that Jared Kushner has been purging Christie allies?</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. Jared did a fantastic job with the campaign. Obviously the PE seeks and respects his counsel very much. Jared is one of the most brilliant people I\u2019ve had the opportunity to work with over the course of this campaign. The way that you described it I would say is completely inaccurate. The one thing I would say is that with the VPE coming in to run the transition team, we\u2019re making sure that we\u2019re bringing in folks who are ready to implement the PE\u2019s vision. And of course the PE is going to have his VPE in charge of the transition team because he spent all this time with him on the campaign trail. He knows exactly what the PE wants to see. He knows the types of people he\u2019ll want to put in place.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Question on response to claims that Steve Bannon is a white supremecist or anti-Semite:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>That\u2019s just folks that are bitter the election\u2019s over. They didn\u2019t get the result that they wanted. Steve Bannon is someone who\u2019s done a fantastic job implementing the PE\u2019s vision on the campaign trail. He\u2019s someone I\u2019ve had the opportunity to work with over the past three or four months, someone ive seen very high character from. Someone who\u2019s been a fantastic example of really being inclusive. Someone who\u2019s embraced diversity at every step.

I find it hard to pray as a result.</p> <p>White American evangelicals, who produced me, and among whom I must count myself, have thoroughly demonstrated how little we care about our representation of Christ to the world, how gleefully willing we are to put our own interests and grievances above the teachings of Jesus. And we have done that where we always do it: in the voting booth.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2016/11/09/exit-polls-show-white-evangelicals-voted-overwhelmingly-for-donald-trump/\">Four in five white evangelicals</a> who cast a vote last week did so for president-elect Trump, who repeatedly encouraged violence at his rallies and bragged that being a celebrity meant no one would stop him from grabbing women \u201cby the pussy\u201d. A dozen women came forward to accuse him of mistreating them. And Christians have such contempt for the work of government that we voted for him anyway.</p> <p>Dismantle the social safety net, the argument goes, and let the church do the work it was called to do. God forbid the church simply express gratitude for aid in a work so infinite that Jesus himself said \u201cThe poor you will always have with you.\u201d</p> <p>But the words of Jesus are apparently worthless to people who are angry that immigrants might be made citizens without suffering enough. If you want your impoverished neighbor\u2019s insulin supply cruelly torn away from her on the extremely slim chance that it might make your own monthly health insurance premiums go down, you will find little validation in the Sermon on the Mount. If you want to halt immigration for people who are fleeing persecution, you will have some trouble with the God of Zechariah, who tells you in so many words, \u201c[D]o not oppress the widow or the orphan, the stranger or the poor; and do not devise evil in your hearts against one another.\u201d</p> <p>Why must an abused child be forced to carry another child to term? Why shouldn\u2019t women be able to easily access birth control or surgeries that will prevent them from dying of sepsis? I can\u2019t find answers for these questions in my Bible.</p> <p>Perhaps white Christians simply gave ourselves the extravagant gift of forgetfulness before entering the voting booth. Perhaps we simply didn\u2019t care.

          "bodyText": "You can find our latest wrap of the evening\u2019s events, with both Clinton and Sanders defending their vision(s), here. Thanks for reading: the live blog will be back tomorrow. Donald Trump renewed his fight with the American media, criticizing the New York Times, ducking reporters to visit a restaurant and turning to Twitter as a means of direct communication. The US president-elect even appeared to allude to his reality TV show The Apprentice as he denied reports that his transition process is in turmoil and plagued by infighting. Trump waged an unprecedented one-man war against the media during his election campaign, banning some organizations from his rallies and regularly inciting his supporters to boo and jeer reporters. He used Twitter, on which he has more than 15 million followers, to berate his critics and throw out often incendiary statements. Tom Hanks has spoken out about the results of the election, reassuring people that the US has seen difficult times before and is still \u201cthe greatest country in the world.\u201d \u201cWe are going to be all right,\u201d he said, according to Vulture. \u201cAmerica has been in worse places than we are at right now.\u201d He went on to praise the constitution, saying: \u201cThat document is going to protect us, over and over again, whether or not our neighbors preserve and protect and defend it themselves.\u201d Senate Democrats today elected Chuck Schumer of New York to lead the party into the Donald Trump era, while Senate Republicans re-elected Mitch McConnell of Kentucky to be their key legislative bridge to the next administration. Schumer had hoped he might be the majority leader if his party recaptured the Senate, working closely with Hillary Clinton\u2019s administration. Instead, the New York Democrat will serve as the party\u2019s main counterweight to a Trump presidency as minority leader. He will replace Harry Reid, the sharp-tongued senator from Nevada, who is retiring. Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, a newly minted member of the Democratic leadership in the upper chamber, has released a statement calling the appointment of Breitbart chair Steve Bannon as president-elect Donald Trump\u2019s chief strategist and senior counsel \u201ctotally unacceptable.\u201d \u201cThis country, since its inception, has struggled to overcome discrimination of all forms: racism, sexism, xenophobia and homophobia,\u201d Sanders declared in a statement. \u201cOver the years we have made progress in becoming a less discriminatory and more tolerant society \u2013 and we are not going backward.\u201d An official in the Chinese foreign ministry has responded to president-elect Donald Trump\u2019s old allegation that the Chinese government created the concept of climate change as a hoax to trick the West into ruining its manufacturing industry. Video: Hillary Clinton\u2019s full speech to the Children\u2019s Defense Fund. One of the key men behind Donald Trump\u2019s transition to power is a 35-year-old real estate mogul, businessman and publisher called Jared Kushner. He is also married to Trump\u2019s influential daughter Ivanka, and is in line to be arguably the most powerful son-in-law to ever set foot in the White House. During the latter stages of the campaign it was Kushner who effectively functioned as Trump\u2019s campaign manger. He advised him on strategy, drafted his speeches and ran the candidate\u2019s digital media campaign. But eight days after Trump\u2019s unexpected victory, Kushner is now at the centre of a messy and Shakespearean body-strewn transition process, variously described as infighting, a \u201cStalinist purge\u201d, and a \u201cknife fight\u201d. On Friday, New Jersey governor Chris Christie was abruptly sacked as head of the transition team and replaced with Trump\u2019s vice-president-elect, Mike Pence. Christie\u2019s ousting is thought to be the result of a feud with Kushner. As a federal prosecutor, Christie prosecuted Kushner\u2019s father, Charles, who was convicted and jailed on charges of tax evasion, witness tampering and illegal campaign contributions. He got two years in jail, and was released after one. While he was in jail, Kushner took over the running of his father\u2019s property business. Earlier this week, two more senior members of Trump\u2019s team were sacked. They were Mike Rogers, who had been handling national security, and Matthew Freedman, a lobbyist and liaison with business and foreign governments. Both were allies of Christie. Good-looking, tall and patrician, Kushner studied at Harvard and New York universities. (According to Daniel Golden, author of The Price of Admissions: How America\u2019s Ruling Class Buys Its Way into Elite Colleges, he was admitted to Harvard after his father donated $2.5m to the university.) At age 26, he was conducting his own mega-deals. In 2007, he bought an office building on Fifth Avenue for a record $1.8bn. Most of the cash involved in the acquisition was borrowed. Kushner has one characteristic which sets him apart from Trump\u2019s alt-right entourage: he\u2019s Jewish. (Ivanka Trump converted to Judaism when they married in 2009; the couple have three children who they\u2019re raising as Orthodox Jews.) Kushner has defended his father-in-law against persistent accusations of antisemitism, including in a notable piece published by the New York Observer, which he owns. Trump has described his son-in-law as a \u201cgreat guy\u201d. The president-elect has also reportedly taken the unprecedented step of requesting security clearance for Kushner to attend top-secret presidential briefings, the first one of which was on Tuesday. It\u2019s unclear if the request will be approved. It marks an astonishing departure and invites the accusation of nepotism. Megyn Kelly, speaking with CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper, declared tonight while promoting her new book that president-elect Donald Trump\u2019s lawyer had to be told that if she were to be killed after the lawyer retweeted a demand that she be \u201cgutted,\u201d \u201cit would not help your candidate.\u201d Hillary Clinton, on facing adversity: America is worth it. Our children are worth it. Believe in our country, fight for our values, and never give up. Because over the past two years, I\u2019ve met so many people who\u2019ve reaffirmed my belief in this country. Speaking in New York City, former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton declared at a gala for the Children\u2019s Defense Fund that \u201cno child\u201d should live in fear of their parents being deported, or of violence at their schools because of their race or religion. \u201cNo child should have to live with fear like that,\u201d Clinton said, in an apparent reference to president-elect Donald Trump\u2019s proposals regarding undocumented immigrants currently residing in the United States. \u201cNo child should be afraid to go to school because they are Latino, or African American, or Muslim, or have a disability.\u201d \u201cThere is work to do,\u201d Clinton continued. \u201cGirls as well as boys, in every country, in every continent, deserve that chance to fulfill their potential.\u201d \u201cIf they can persevere, so can all of us.\u201d On a conference call with reporters tonight, Republican National Committee strategist Sean Spicer and president-elect Donald Trump\u2019s senior communications advisor, Jason Miller, announced that landing teams will be deployed in the coming days to start the transition process and noted that all of those joining landing teams will sign a pledge that they will not serve as a lobbyist at the federal and state level for the next five years. They also noted several of the meetings that the president-elect had held with potential cabinet members today, including Alabama senator Jeff Sessions, General Mike Flynn, Georgia congressman Tom Price, Kansas congressman Mike Pompeo and charter school activist Eva Moskowitz. They added that Trump is expected to meet tomorrow with South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, Florida governor Rick Scott and former secretary of state Henry Kissinger, among others. Speaking at a gala celebrating the Children\u2019s Defense Fund, former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton told the audience of philanthropists and children\u2019s rights activists that although after the loss of the presidential race one week ago, she wanted to \u201ccurl up with a book, maybe my dogs, and never leave the house again,\u201d but that she was inspired in part by the stories of the children that the organization helps. \u201cThe arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice. Now, sometimes it can feel awfully long - believe me, I know,\u201d Clinton said, to muted laughter. \u201cBut it does bend towards justice.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t get to stop paying rent just because things don\u2019t go your way,\u201d Clinton continued. \u201cI know that many of you are disappointed in the results of last week\u2019s election - so am I, more than I can ever express, but as I said last week, our campaign was never about one person or even one election,\u201d Clinton said, but about \u201cbuilding an America that is hopeful, inclusive and bighearted.\u201d Watch it live here. Video: Donald Trump\u2019s name has been stripped from three New York City apartment buildings that he once developed and later sold, after protests from the building\u2019s residents that the name was negatively affecting their ability to attract renters and buyers. Kellyanne Conway, adviser for president-elect Donald Trump\u2019s transition team, dismissed reports of problems in forming his cabinet in an on-camera interview with pool reporters this evening, and said that new appointments should be announced soon. \u201cWe feel really good about the transition,\u201d Conway said. \u201cI actually would just say it\u2019s false to say it\u2019s not going well.\u201d From the long-suffering transition pool: At about 7:35 pm the elevator came down to the lobby and the doors opened. Sen. Jeff Sessions was inside, but he did not get off the elevator. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani came into the lobby at about 7:39 pm. \u201cWe discussed the transition,\u201d Giuliani said, adding, \u201cIt went really well.\u201d Reporters asked if he could reveal any names under consideration and Giuliani said he had to keep it to himself. Your pooler tried to ask Giuliani for one word to describe his foreign policy doctrine and once again he responded with a laugh as he headed into the Trump Tower bar. An order of five pizza pies and other food from Angelo\u2019s was brought upstairs shortly before Giuliani arrived and the mayor confirmed it was food for the meetings. He said he didn\u2019t get to have any pizza but \u201cgot to smell it\u201d before taking a jab at the infamous incident where current Mayor Bill de Blasio ate pizza with a fork. \u201cI\u2019d also like to make clear that I eat pizza this way, not with a knife and fork,\u201d Giuliani said as he demonstrated his slice folding technique with his hands. Soon afterwards, professional skateboarder Billy Rohan walked through the lobby and called out to the press. \u201cTrump loves Muslims too!\u201d he shouted. \u201cA salaam aleikum! Peace be upon you!\u201d Rohan said he met with Trump earlier today and came away impressed. \u201cIt was the opposite of what I expected. You know how you hear about Freemasons and then you meet one and it is the opposite of what you expected? It was like that,\u201d Rohan said. Rohan claimed he told Trump to spread peace by building skate parks around the world like he once rebuilt the skating rink in New York. He said Trump was receptive to the idea. Your pooler has reached out to the campaign to confirm whether the meeting between Trump and Rohan actually occurred. As of this writing, we have not received a response. For planning purposes: Texas senator and former #NeverTrump figurehead Ted Cruz will be interviewed on Fox News Channel\u2019s Fox &amp; Friends tomorrow morning during the 7am ET hour. This will be Cruz\u2019s first interview since his meeting with president-elect Donald Trump at Trump Tower on Tuesday, and his first interview on the cable news network since May 1, 2016. Fortunately, where Bernie Sanders\u2019 livestream has failed, the Guardian\u2019s David Smith has succeeded: Here are highlights from the Vermont senator\u2019s speech at George Washington University from the Guardian\u2019s Washington correspondent. Vermont senator and former Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders is currently speaking at George Washington University in Washington, DC - although you wouldn\u2019t know it, because the livestream carried exclusively by his OurRevolution.com site has completely frozen for all its would-be viewers. Facebook comments posit that the new site is not built to handle this amount of traffic on streaming video. Apparently, the Revolution will not be televised. Watch it live here: The Australian prime minister\u2019s office has confirmed that Malcolm Turnbull became one of the first world leaders to ring Donald Trump \u2013 thanks to golfer Greg Norman. Norman is a friend of Trump and handed over his contact details to Joe Hockey, Australia\u2019s ambassador to the US, allowing Turnbull to make an early call to the president-elect. Bernie Sanders will be in Washington DC at 7pm ET to talk about his new book, Our Revolution: A Future to Believe in. Then at 8.30pm, Hillary Clinton makes her first public appearance since she conceded to Trump (that hike in the woods doesn\u2019t count) with a speech at a Children\u2019s Defense Fund event at the Newseum. That\u2019s around 8.30pm ET. We\u2019ll have news of both here in the live blog. On Thursday, Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, will be the first foreign leader to meet Donald Trump. Probably. Reuters reports that planning for the meeting might not be going \u2026 smoothly: One day before Trump\u2019s first meeting with a foreign leader, Japanese officials said they had not finalized when or where in New York it would take place, who would be invited, or in some cases whom to call for answers. Japanese and US officials said on Wednesday the state department had not been involved in planning the meeting, leaving the logistical and protocol details that normally would be settled far in advance still to be determined. \u201cThere has been a lot of confusion,\u201d said one Japanese official. The meeting was only agreed to last week, and Trump and his advisers have been busy in meetings at his headquarters in Manhattan\u2019s Trump Tower in recent days to work out who gets which job in the new administration. While world leaders sometimes hold loosely planned bilateral meetings at regional summits, it is unusual for foreign leaders to hold high-level diplomatic talks in the United States without detailed planning. Abe is on his way to an Asia-Pacific summit in Peru. State department spokesman John Kirby said that to his knowledge, Trump\u2019s transition team had not been in contact with the department either to discuss the transition of government or to seek information ahead of his meetings with foreign leaders. Trump is expected to use the Abe meeting to reassure Japan and other Asian allies rattled by his campaign rhetoric, advisers to Trump said. But Trump, a brash outsider with no diplomatic or government experience, and Abe, a veteran lawmaker, have differences on policy issues such as free trade. Several Trump aides did not immediately answer requests on Wednesday for comment about the Abe visit or contact between the transition team and the state department. This is Claire Phipps picking up the live blog from Scott Bixby. In one of his final acts in office, Barack Obama selected key figures in sports, entrepreneurship, philanthropy, activism, academia and entertainment among the 21 people who will be awarded the 2016 Presidential Medal of Freedom \u2013 the highest civilian honor in the US. Obama will present recipients including rocker Bruce Springsteen, Motown soul singer Diana Ross, former basketball champions Michael Jordan and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and actors Tom Hanks, Robert De Niro and Robert Redford with the medal at a White House ceremony on 22 November, the White House said on Wednesday. \u201cThe Presidential Medal of Freedom is not just our nation\u2019s highest civilian honor \u2013 it\u2019s a tribute to the idea that all of us, no matter where we come from, have the opportunity to change this country for the better,\u201d Obama said in a statement. The medal is given annually to people who have made outstanding contributions to the security or national interests of the US, to world peace, or to cultural or other significant public or private endeavors. This year\u2019s roster also includes Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and his wife Melinda for their philanthropic foundation, TV talkshow host Ellen DeGeneres, veteran actor Cicely Tyson, architect Frank Gehry and baseball broadcaster Vin Scully. The group also includes several not so well known Americans, such as late Native American community leader Elouise Cobell and Nasa moon landing computer scientist Margaret H Hamilton. Cc: @APStyleBook. Nicole Hockley, who lost her son in the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting in 2012, faced a row of television cameras on Tuesday. She and other Sandy Hook families were filing an appeal in their battle against the gun companies who had made the military-style rifle used to kill their children. What was her reaction to Donald Trump\u2019s victory, reporters asked her. Was she scared? Hockley, composed and forceful, offered a reality check: even if Hillary Clinton had been elected president, Congress would not have passed gun control legislation. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a very committed gun violence prevention president in place for the last eight years, and we\u2019re not seeing significant federal change,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is about bottom-up change, not top-down,\u201d she told the cameras. \u201cThis is more about a community groundswell that\u2019s needed.\u201d Hockley\u2019s fight for gun violence prevention has been focused on state and local action \u2013 and having Trump in the White House did not change that strategy. Obama, a passionate advocate for gun violence prevention, has \u201ctried everything. He can\u2019t get it passed,\u201d she said in an in-depth interview with Guardian US. When it comes to guns, \u201cI still don\u2019t think our country is ready yet for federal change,\u201d she said. \u201cI think there are still too many people that are uninformed or misinformed on this issue, that believe it\u2019s never going to happen to them, that believe it has nothing to do with access to weapons.\u201d \u201cThis is not the time to bow out,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is where we have to double down our efforts. Regardless of who\u2019s in office, people are still dying every day, and there\u2019s an opportunity to save lives.\u201d From the long-suffering transition pool: Former Mayor Rudy Giuliani came to Trump Tower shortly after 5:00pm. As he waited for the elevator reporters shouted questions at him including whether he will be Secretary of State and if he thinks Gov. Christie did a good job with the transition. Your pooler asked him for one word to sum up his approach to foreign policy and he laughed. Will send along video of this shortly. Mayor Giuliani said he might speak to the press when he comes back downstairs. An official in the Chinese foreign ministry has responded to president-elect Donald Trump\u2019s old allegation that the Chinese government created the concept of climate change as a hoax to trick the West into ruining its manufacturing industry. \u201cIf you look at the history of climate change negotiations, actually it was initiated by the [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] with the support of the Republicans during the Reagan and senior Bush administration during the late 1980s,\u201d vice foreign minister Liu Zhenmin told reporters today at United Nations talks in Morocco. Liu stated that American commitment to decreasing carbon emissions could actually increase its economic competitiveness: \u201cThat\u2019s why I hope the Republican\u2019s administration will continue to support this process.\u201d Donald Trump has renewed his fight with the American media, criticizing the New York Times, ducking reporters to visit a restaurant and turning to Twitter as a means of direct communication. The US president-elect even appeared to allude to his reality TV show The Apprentice as he denied reports that his transition process is in turmoil and plagued by infighting. Trump waged an unprecedented one-man war against the media during his election campaign, banning some organisations from his rallies and regularly inciting his supporters to boo and jeer reporters. He used Twitter, on which he has more than 15 million followers, to berate his critics and throw out often incendiary statements. Not even his elevated status as the next leader of the free world appears to have changed his habits. Whereas Barack Obama gave his first press conference three days after his election in 2008, Trump is yet to do so, instead giving a primetime TV interview and unleashing a barrage of tweets, yet again taking the US presidency into uncharted waters. \u201cVery organized process taking place as I decide on Cabinet and many other positions,\u201d he posted on Twitter late on Tuesday. \u201cI am the only one who knows who the finalists are!\u201d His reference to \u201cthe finalists\u201d seemed to deliberately evoke The Apprentice, in which contestants battled each other for a chance to work at his business and he told those who fell short: \u201cYou\u2019re fired!\u201d The Twitter storm resumed early on Wednesday morning when he denied media reports that his three adult children \u2013 Don Jr, Eric and Ivanka \u2013 would be receiving security clearances, raising potential conflicts of interest. \u201cI am not trying to get \u2018top level security clearance\u2019 for my children. This was a typically false news story.\u201d Delaware senator Chris Coons, a graduate of Yale Divinity School who occasionally still gives sermons on Sunday, has framed his criticism of president-elect Donald Trump\u2019s appointment of Steve Bannon as his chief strategist and senior counsel as welcoming \u201cthe toxic blend of hate and bigotry that Mr. Bannon has made a living propagating\u201d into the White House: In his election night victory speech, president-elect Trump pledged to be a president of all Americans. His choice of Steve Bannon as his chief strategist is deeply disturbing and fundamentally inconsistent with that pledge. Mr. Bannon personally has made despicable comments about women, the LGBT community, people of faith, and those with mental illness. At Breitbart, Mr. Bannon created an outlet built upon stoking racism, sexism, homophobia, and anti-Semitism. These are not the values that have made America great. Inclusion and diversity are at the foundation of our nation\u2019s success and our leadership in the world, and I will continue to defend those values. The president-elect must make it clear that the toxic blend of hate and bigotry that Mr. Bannon has made a living propagating has no place in a Trump administration. Former Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway has denied reports that president-elect Donald Trump\u2019s transition to the White House was in turmoil and plagued by infighting, saying that new appointments were expected \u201csoon.\u201d Speaking to reporters in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York City, Kellyanne Conway said: \u201cYou don\u2019t form a federal government overnight and these are very serious issues, very serious appointments, very serious considerations.\u201d BREAKING TRUMP MEATLOAF NEWS: Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks told your pooler she is traveling today and cannot confirm whether President-elect Trump had his mother\u2019s meatloaf today. However, she did note that \u2018it is a favorite of his.\u2019 Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, a newly minted member of the Democratic leadership in the upper chamber, has released a statement calling the appointment of Breitbart chair Steve Bannon as president-elect Donald Trump\u2019s chief strategist and senior counsel \u201ctotally unacceptable.\u201d \u201cThis country, since its inception, has struggled to overcome discrimination of all forms: racism, sexism, xenophobia and homophobia,\u201d Sanders declared in a statement. \u201cOver the years we have made progress in becoming a less discriminatory and more tolerant society \u2013 and we are not going backward.\u201d \u201cThe appointment by president-elect Trump of a racist individual like Mr. Bannon to a position of authority is totally unacceptable,\u201d Sanders continued. \u201cIn a democratic society we can disagree all we want over issues, but racism and bigotry cannot be part of any public policy. The appointment of Mr. Bannon by Mr. Trump must be rescinded.\u201d Republicans have thus far largely declined to criticize Trump\u2019s decision to appoint Bannon, despite the latter\u2019s record of promoting white supremacy. President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s transition team has released a full list of the foreign heads of state with whom Trump and vice president-elect Mike Pence have spoken: President of Argentina, Mauricio Macri Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia, Malcolm Turnbull Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau President of the People\u2019s Republic of China, Xi Jinping President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos Calder\u00f3n President of the Arab Republic of Egypt, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi Prime Minister of Denmark, Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, Dr. Angela Merkel President of France, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande Prime Minister of Ireland, Enda Kenny Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu Prime Minister of Italy, Matteo Renzi Prime Minister of Japan, Shinz\u014d Abe King Abdullah II bin Al Hussein of Jordan Prime Minister of Lebanon, Saad Al Hariri President of Mexico, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto Prime Minister of New Zealand, John Key His Highness Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al-Thani of Qatar Prime Minister of the Republic of India, Narendra Modi President of the Republic of Korea, Park Geun-hye President of the Republic of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud of Saudi Arabia Prime Minister of Turkey, Binali Yildirim President of Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko President of the United Arab Emirates and Ruler of Abu Dhabi, H.H. Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces, Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May Secretary General to the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon Frank Gaffney, the founder and president of the reputationally challenged Center for Security Policy and a hardline conspiracy theorist who has floated the notion that President Barack Obama is a crypto-Muslim, has denied numerous media reports that he has been brought on to advise president-elect Donald Trump\u2019s transition team. \u201cAn unattributed quote appeared in the press yesterday indicating that I had been appointed to the Trump transition team,\u201d Gaffney told Politico in a statement today. \u201cIn fact, I had not been contacted by anyone from the team and appreciate the campaign\u2019s clarification today that the previous day\u2019s reports were inaccurate. I look forward to helping the president-elect and the national security-minded team he is assembling in whatever way I can.\u201d Gaffney, who once served as Texas senator Ted Cruz\u2019s campaign advisor on national security issues, has repeatedly expressed concerns about a \u201cworrying pattern of official US submission to Islam and the theo-political-legal program the latter\u2019s authorities call Shariah.\u201d Gaffney has also accused numerous members and allies of the Obama administration were acting as Islamic fifth columnists, including Hillary Clinton advisor Huma Abedin. Both the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times reported last night that Gaffney was serving an informal role in the Trump transition, citing unidentified sources. Mr Trump\u2019s Mother\u2019s Meatloaf, anyone? The Bidens have lunched with the Pences at the vice president\u2019s residence at the Naval Observatory. Now they\u2019ve finished, the press pool reports. They took some questions and we\u2019ll have the details shortly. According to the vice president\u2019s office, the Bidens gave the Pences a tour of the grounds before lunch, then a tour of the house. Kellyanne Conway, who has said she\u2019s been offered a job in the Trump administration, was asked about Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner possibly having top security clearance. Conway suggested Kushner may get the presidential daily briefing. Why? What\u2019s his role? Reid is asked how he feels about bringing back earmarks, ie specified spending for pet projects in legislators\u2019 home districts, which are currently outlawed but which used to grease every old budget deal. Reid: Me? What a question to ask me? I\u2019m one of the kings of earmarks. I think it was a terrible disservice to America to come up with this stupid stupid idea to stop.... it\u2019s the way we get things done around here. I\u2019ve never apologized to anybody. I go home and I boast about earmarks. And that\u2019s what everyone should do. Here come the Democrats now on Capitol Hill. Outgoing senate minority leader Harry Reid apologizes for being late. Reid says he wants to pass a budget instead of relying on a patchwork of continuing resolutions to fund the government. He wants to move on presidential nominations. \u201cWe\u2019re ready to work with Republicans during these next few weeks,\u201d Reid says. We\u2019ll hold our breaths. Reid opens it to questions. Question: Have you accepted the election result? Do you love the electoral college? \u201cI think it would be educational for the country to have some hearings on the electoral college system,\u201d Reid says, adding that Clinton would end with a 2m+ vote lead on Trump. Reid points out that the loser got more votes than the winner in 2000 too. \u201cOf course I\u2019ve accepted [the result], whether I\u2019ve really put it behind me, the answer is no, this is something that will be with me for a long time, I\u2019m terribly disappointed.\u201d Mitch McConnell, in a Republican news conference on Capitol Hill, is asked about Steve Bannon: \u201cI\u2019m not going to comment on White House personnel choices.\u201d McConnell is asked about the tone of the campaign: American campaigns are pretty robust. I think a lot of Americans don\u2019t realize we\u2019ve had a lot of elections like this in the past. I\u2019m thinking of 1824.... What\u2019s different is with the Internet, and 24-hour TV everybody gets constantly confronted with all this. I think it\u2019s time for the election to be over... to lower the tone. What do Bruce Springsteen, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Diana Ross have in common? They\u2019re all about to get presidential medals of freedom: Goodness. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s most prized possessions: the treasured items that matter to him most and the stories behind them.\u201d Any plans for Friday night? Former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard David Duke defends Steve Bannon: Michelle Obama and Melania Trump met at the White House last week for what was by all accounts a cordial encounter and there\u2019s no reason whatsoever America to believe that Mrs Obama has in any way lost her resolve or succumbed to self-pity and regret. De Blasio told Trump that some families in New York, \u201cthe ultimate city of immigrants,\u201d feared being split apart and said the president-elect needed to consider the long-term consequences for the well-being of the city of his immigration policies: \u201cI talked to him about concerns of potential deportations, I gave him the perspective of the NYPD\u201d that you could create serious distrust between police and neighborhoods, De Blasio says. He calls NYC \u201cthe ultimate city of immigrants.\u201d Here De Blasio says \u201cwe are not going back to OVERUSE of stop-and-frisk\u201d \u2013 leaving open the question of just how much stop-and-frisk we\u2019re going back to? Ahead of a slate of formal meetings in Berlin tomorrow, Barack Obama and German chancellor Angela Merkel will dine together informally at his hotel this evening, the White House pool reports: The President will be taking part in an informal and private dinner with Chancellor Merkel this evening at his hotel. A few NBA teams are reportedly boycotting Trump hotels. The season started three weeks ago: On the wave of anti-Semitism that has risen with Trump, De Blasio says he told Trump: We\u2019ve seen a worrisome increase in some parts of this country... there are deep fears and concerns out there... the wrong messages can encourage hateful acts. De Blasio said he wanted to give Trump a feel of concerns everyone is feeling about his presidency. They discussed financial regulations, particularly deeply concerning reports that Trump may roll back part of the Dodd-Frank law, de Blasio says. He said they talked about the tax code and he emphasized the need to invest in infrastructure and not hit the middle and working classes. \u201cI talked to him about concerns of potential deportations, I gave him the perspective of the NYPD\u201d that you could create serious distrust between police and neighborhoods, De Blasio says. He calls NYC \u201cthe ultimate city of immigrants.\u201d They talked about stop and frisk. \u201cI tried to provide a perspective on stop-and-frisk... we knew that we were never going back to that policy.\u201d De Blasio said it drove a wedge between police and people. De Blasio says there are more than 900 Muslim members of the NYPD and we rely on their willingness to protect the city and respect needs to be shown to the Muslim community. De Blasio said he warned Trump about rhetoric: \u201cI let him know that so many New Yorkers were fearful and that more had to be done to show that this country can heal, that people be respected.\u201d De Blasio: Even though I have very real differences with the president-elect, he is a New Yorker, I do think he loves this city. Here\u2019s de Blasio: Here\u2019s a transcript of a conversation just then between former Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway and the press pool. Conway: I was in DC yesterday at both transition offices and it\u2019s really something to walk into our transition office in Washington DC and see everything from seasoned Reagan hands .. and then to look around the room and see millennials who were born after President Reagan left office. That\u2019s really the hive of activity. Question on rumors that transition is disorganized, not going well, slow, people are getting fired: I just don\u2019t see it that way. It\u2019s just not that way. Those are false.\u201d Question: did Trump intentionally mislead the press when he went to dinner (last night)? No. He was just having dinner with his family.\u201d Question: when will Trump do a press conference? Shortly, I would say. Sometime soon. But obviously he\u2019s meeting with \u2013 talking to heads of state and possible members of his Cabinet and senior team, filling out his senior leadership team. A lot of activity going on upstairs. So. I know he looking forward to\u201d [addressing you all?] Question: any names announced today? I\u2019m not sure it\u2019ll be today. But it will be soon. It\u2019s a lot to digest in putting together a federal government.\u201d Question: is Trump considering a registry for Muslims or a ban on Muslims? We haven\u2019t talked about that. I think he\u2019s been very clear on his position on that issue.\u201d Question: over a week since election and only 2 appointments so far? You don\u2019t form a federal government overnight and these are very serious issues, very serious appointments, very serious considerations. And I was reading Politico earlier and noticed that we\u2019re pretty much on track to where other administrations had been, definitely internally in terms of vetting different candidates and thinking through and interviewing different people. It\u2019s not the kind of thing to rush through.\u201d (She seemed to be scanning the pool for someone from Politico) Colorado senator Cory Gardner will be in charge of coordinating and directing Republican efforts to strengthen their hold on the senate, as incoming chairman of the national Republican senatorial committee, the NRSC announces: Reuters reports that \u201cMexico\u2019s foreign ministry announced fresh steps on Wednesday to provide support to Mexican citizens living in the United States following the victory in last week\u2019s U.S. presidential election by Donald Trump, who has promised to crack down on immigrants in the country illegally\u201d: The ministry said it was acting to help Mexicans avoid fraud and abuses in the United States. It said it would expand the availability of mobile consulate services to reach more migrants in their communities, establish a 24-hour telephone line for questions about immigration, and provide more appointments for migrants to get passports, birth certificates and consular identification cards. The ministry also said Mexico will \u201cstrengthen dialogue\u201d with U.S. state and local authorities to protect its citizens, and added that migrants in the United States should \u201cavoid any conflict situation\u201d and stay out of trouble with the law. Read the full piece here. Here\u2019s a partial transcript of what Trump spokesman Jason Miller has just told reporters at Trump tower. Thanks to Todd Gillman of the Dallas News. PE stands for president-elect and VPE stands for vice-president-elect. Question on the perceived slow pace of personnel announcements and decisions: The PE and the VPE are taking a very structured methodical approach to this\u2026.We\u2019re not going to rush.\u2026 We\u2019re going to make sure that they\u2019re people that we are confident will pass confirmation and they\u2019re going to be people that we think can implement the PE\u2019s vision. It\u2019s also important to look back that President Obama even didn\u2019t have his entire cabinet formed in the first week. We\u2019re going to make sure we get it right.\u201d Question: Will you announce national security team first? When the PE is ready to put that forward then we will.\u201d (no timetable who will be announced before others.) \u201cObviously we\u2019re taking this very seriously and we know we have a finite amount of time to get this put together\u2026. Inside, there\u2019s a very solid plan. There\u2019s a methodical approach to all this being put together. [despite news reports] \u2026 It\u2019s very calm, it\u2019s very structured and anyone saying anything else is either A, bitter, because they\u2019re not on the inside and they\u2019re not being considered, or they\u2019re someone who\u2019s just bitter because the election was last week and they didn\u2019t get the result that they wanted. \u2026 The PE will be putting forward some very fine people. It\u2019ll be some folks who\u2019ll be outside the box. There will be some people who have been very successful in fields of business, in fields of education.\u201d Question on reports that Jared Kushner has been purging Christie allies? Couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. Jared did a fantastic job with the campaign. Obviously the PE seeks and respects his counsel very much. Jared is one of the most brilliant people I\u2019ve had the opportunity to work with over the course of this campaign. The way that you described it I would say is completely inaccurate. The one thing I would say is that with the VPE coming in to run the transition team, we\u2019re making sure that we\u2019re bringing in folks who are ready to implement the PE\u2019s vision. And of course the PE is going to have his VPE in charge of the transition team because he spent all this time with him on the campaign trail. He knows exactly what the PE wants to see. He knows the types of people he\u2019ll want to put in place.\u201d Question on response to claims that Steve Bannon is a white supremecist or anti-Semite: That\u2019s just folks that are bitter the election\u2019s over. They didn\u2019t get the result that they wanted. Steve Bannon is someone who\u2019s done a fantastic job implementing the PE\u2019s vision on the campaign trail. He\u2019s someone I\u2019ve had the opportunity to work with over the past three or four months, someone ive seen very high character from. Someone who\u2019s been a fantastic example of really being inclusive. Someone who\u2019s embraced diversity at every step. I think he\u2019ll do a great job working with chief of staff Reince Priebus\u2026 to implement PE Trump\u2019s vision. And that\u2019s the important thing. There\u2019s one boss, and that\u2019s the PE. He\u2019s the person who\u2019s going to have the final say on nominees who are going to be put forward\u201d and on senior staff. Question on how serious a contender is Ted Cruz for attorney general? Obviously I am a big fan of Senator Cruz\u2019s and whether there is something within the administration or whether it\u2019s as an ally on Capitol Hill, I think Senator Cruz is happy that we\u2019re going to have a president who\u2019s going to push for conservative reforms, who\u2019s going to make sure that we\u2019re appointing the right kind of Supreme Court choices, and I think Senator Cruz will be a strong ally for President-elect Trump. Incoming senate budgetary committee ranking member Bernie Sanders \u2013 he ran for president this year too \u2013 is going to give what his activist group Our Revolution bills as \u201ca major speech\u201d this evening \u201cabout the future of our country under the presidency of Donald Trump.\u201d Developing... As we enter the era of Donald Trump, I have to confess that I only now understand how purely cruel my fellow Christians are. I find it hard to pray as a result. White American evangelicals, who produced me, and among whom I must count myself, have thoroughly demonstrated how little we care about our representation of Christ to the world, how gleefully willing we are to put our own interests and grievances above the teachings of Jesus. And we have done that where we always do it: in the voting booth. Four in five white evangelicals who cast a vote last week did so for president-elect Trump, who repeatedly encouraged violence at his rallies and bragged that being a celebrity meant no one would stop him from grabbing women \u201cby the pussy\u201d. A dozen women came forward to accuse him of mistreating them. And Christians have such contempt for the work of government that we voted for him anyway. Dismantle the social safety net, the argument goes, and let the church do the work it was called to do. God forbid the church simply express gratitude for aid in a work so infinite that Jesus himself said \u201cThe poor you will always have with you.\u201d But the words of Jesus are apparently worthless to people who are angry that immigrants might be made citizens without suffering enough. If you want your impoverished neighbor\u2019s insulin supply cruelly torn away from her on the extremely slim chance that it might make your own monthly health insurance premiums go down, you will find little validation in the Sermon on the Mount. If you want to halt immigration for people who are fleeing persecution, you will have some trouble with the God of Zechariah, who tells you in so many words, \u201c[D]o not oppress the widow or the orphan, the stranger or the poor; and do not devise evil in your hearts against one another.\u201d Why must an abused child be forced to carry another child to term? Why shouldn\u2019t women be able to easily access birth control or surgeries that will prevent them from dying of sepsis? I can\u2019t find answers for these questions in my Bible. Perhaps white Christians simply gave ourselves the extravagant gift of forgetfulness before entering the voting booth. Perhaps we simply didn\u2019t care. [...] Read the full piece here: \u201cFrench far-right party leader Marine Le Pen said on Wednesday that her election as president next year would form a trio of world leaders with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin that \u2018would be good for world peace\u2019,\u201d Reuters reports: Inaugurating her campaign headquarters for France\u2019s 2017 election, just less than one mile away from the Elysee presidential palace, Le Pen said the premises were \u201ca stopover on the way to (her) final destination down the road.\u201d Anti-Europe and anti-immigration, the 48-year-old Le Pen was the only French political leader who backed Trump in the U.S. election. Her National Front party has been buoyed by his victory and that of Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union, hoping to ride a similar anti-establishment wave in France to victory in next year\u2019s poll. \u201cThere is a worldwide movement. A worldwide movement which rejects unchecked globalisation, destructive ultra-liberalism ... the elimination of nation states, the disappearance of borders,\u201d Le Pen told reporters. \u201cThe forces at work in these various elections are ideas, forces which could bring about my election as the president of France next May.\u201d As for the Republican senate leadership: If it ain\u2019t broke (?!?), don\u2019t fix it: Former Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway tells the press pool that a rumor that Donald Trump is not in Trump tower is \u201cincorrect\u201d: Conway sent a text message to pooler Hunter Walker (@hunterw): \u201cIncorrect. How do these nonsense rumors get started,\u201d Conway wrote, adding, \u201cHe is here.\u201d Further from Walker: Trump spokesman Jason Miller just spoke with the media for approximately 10 minutes. He denied rumors that [Trump son-in-law] Jared Kushner has pushed [New Jersey governor Chris] Christie allies off the transition team, addressed claims that [incoming chief White House strategist] Steve Bannon is a white supremacist and an anti-Semite, and responded to criticism of Trump ditching the pool. Trump\u2019s spokeswoman promises that Trump is in Trump tower: He\u2019s totally not there, is he? &lt;---- That\u2019s a joke. &lt;-----We think. Former House intelligence committee chairman Mike Rogers, who more recently is a former member of Donald Trump\u2019s transition team, says \u201cthere\u2019s some confusion going on\u201d inside the transition: Here\u2019s our further coverage of the transition in disarray: Vermont senator Bernie Sanders will be the ranking member on the budget committee in the 115th Congress, according to a list released by incoming minority leader Chuck Schumer. As the top Democrat on the committee, Sanders and his staff will be in charge of drafting an alternative budget to the one presented by Republicans. Republican Senator Mike Enzi of Wyoming chaired the budget committee in the 114th congress. Here are the top Democrats\u2019 committee assignments, via CQ Roll Call: Bubble-wrap those letters and ship them to the White House: Senator Chuck Schumer has announced that Bernie Sanders (Vermont) Tammy Baldwin (Wisconsin) and Joe Manchin (West Virginia) will join the senate leadership team: From your long-suffering transition pool: New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio arrived at Trump Tower at about 10:39 am. Your pooler asked if he was meeting with Trump. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about what the people of New York City are feeling and what we need,\u201d de Blasio said. De Blasio, who boarded the elevators very quickly, did not respond to a question from your pooler about whether he is concerned about a spike in hate crimes in the city. De Blasio has said the city will aggressively prosecute hate crime in the Trump era. On Sunday the mayor\u2019s office responded to an incident in which a swastika was spray-painted on a Brooklyn sidewalked: Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s belief that face news on Fakebook fake news on Facebook could not have swayed the election because nobody shares it makes Ben Collins in the Daily Beast wonder what Facebook Mark Zuckerberg is hanging out on: Mark Zuckerberg has been in the crosshairs this week, even from within his own company, for saying he believes \u201cit\u2019s a pretty crazy idea\u201d that \u201cfake news on Facebook, which is a very small amount of content, influenced the election in any way.\u201d He should take a look at the most shared stories on his website, according to trend analysis site Trendolizer, and see if he can reconcile his PR statement with the truth. At least a dozen stories with no basis in reality\u2014most of them favoring Donald Trump\u2014broke Facebook\u2019s trending algorithm Monday and Tuesday, as the new president-elect took to his own Twitter account to repeatedly deride fact-checked newspapers like The New York Times. Read the full piece here. The news is exactly as anticipated: senate Democrats have picked Chuck Schumer, of New York, as their new leader. Senator Patty Murray of Washington, a budget specialist, has been named assistant leader; Dick Durbin of Illinois is still minority whip; and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan also will fill a leadership role. From your long-suffering transition pool: Trump advance team director George Gigicos arrived at 9:40. Reporters asked what he\u2019s doing today. \u201cI don\u2019t know I\u2019m just getting here,\u201d Gigicos said. Trump campaign COO Eli Miller arrived at 9:43. He did not respond to questions from reporters. Steve Mnuchin, a member of the transition team executive committee and possible pick for treasury secretary, arrived shortly afterwards and spoke to reporters. Mnuchin said he and Trump had \u201ctalked about taxes.\u201d \u201cI think the other thing \u2014 very big focus \u2014 is regulatory changes, looking at the creation of an infrastructure bank to fund infrastructure investments. So, there\u2019s a lot of things to do and I\u2019d say the economic priorities are clearly taxes, regulatory, trade, and infrastructure.\u201d Mnuchin later added: \u201cRight now we\u2019re just still in the planning stages, as you can see, we want to be in a position where in the first 100 days we can execute the economic plan.\u201d Mnuchin was also asked when the transition team would hold a press conference. He said he was \u201cnot commenting.\u201d Mnuchin was also asked about staffing and when Trump would announce an economic team. \u201cI\u2019m really focused on the policies right now and getting things done,\u201d Mnuchin said. Senator Jeff Sessions arrived at Trump Tower at about 10:02 am toting a rolling suitcase. He was asked if there would be any announcements today. \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Sessions said. Kellyanne Conway arrived at about 10:07 am. She walked over to the elevators from somewhere within Trump Tower. Conway declined to come over and speak to the press though she waved and gave a thumbs up. We don\u2019t know that Trump will use the White House to enrich himself and his family and cronies, but anyone who has observed how he pays taxes or runs his foundation and casinos and businesses, or who has come face-to-face with the fact that for Trump, nothing is absolute \u2013 contracts, facts, settled history, videotaped incidents, your hand in front of your face \u2013 any such person might see a serious potential for corruption ahead: Barack Obama in Athens: \u2018Democracy can be complicated\u2019 \u2013 video Former Maryland governor and presidential candidate Martin O\u2019Malley has withdrawn from contention to be new chairman of the Democratic national committee. Representative Keith Ellison of Minnesota has emerged as the frontrunner for the post, with the support of close ally Bernie Sanders, outgoing senate minority leader Harry Reid, (probable) incoming senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and others. The Washington Post published a story Tuesday on various potential controversies attached to Ellison: Earlier in his career, Ellison apologized for and/or backed off a number of controversial statements and politically dicey moves, from likening George W. Bush\u2019s consolidation of power post-9/11 to the rise of Adolf Hitler, to defending the leader of the National of Islam, to labeling his 2012 reelection opponent a \u201clowlife scumbag.\u201d These comments have rarely been an issue for Ellison in his safe Minneapolis-based district, but now that he\u2019s competing to lead the Democratic Party, they\u2019ve resurfaced. In the Trump era, is it daft even to speculate that a 10-year-old comment by Ellison about George W Bush might disqualify him for a political leadership role? Hello and welcome to our live-wire coverage of US politics. President-elect Donald Trump has spent his morning contradicting reports that personnel firings have left his transition team in disarray: Trump specifically takes issue with a New York Times report that US allies are \u201cstruggling to make contact\u201d because his team has jettisoned protocol: Prominent American allies were in the meantime scrambling to figure out how and when to contact Mr. Trump. At times, they have been patched through to him in his luxury office tower with little warning, according to a Western diplomat who spoke on the condition of anonymity to detail private conversations. Trump asserts that the report is wrong: Trump does not address security clearances for Kushner Finally, Trump contradicts a story his team had previously contradicted in a statement, that he was seeking top security clearances for his children. But Trump does not address the latest twist in the story, from last night, when NBC News reported that Trump had sought top-level security clearance for his son-in-law, Jared Kushner: Trump grabs dinner Trump gave his protective press pool the slip last night to grab dinner at the 21 Club, which is a few blocks south of Trump tower: Thank you for reading and please join us in the comments.",

These churning waters off the coast of Vancouver are marked by a constant flow of ferries and containers ships \u2013 but they are also home to 80 or so orcas.

But now the orcas of the Salish sea face what conservationists say is their biggest threat to date: an expansion proposal for a pipeline that would snake from Alberta to the Pacific coast. Spearheaded by Texas-based energy infrastructure company Kinder Morgan, the C$6.8bn ($5bn) Trans Mountain Expansion project is designed to transport Alberta\u2019s landlocked bitumen to international markets. The proposal \u2013 which still needs the approval of the federal government, led by Justin Trudeau \u2013 would expand an existing pipeline to lay nearly 1,000km of new pipeline from Alberta to Vancouver\u2019s coastline.

In his final public appearance to promote this year\u2019s You Want It Darker, he seemed at pains to dismiss suggestions that it some kind of musical last will and testament: \u2018I intend to live forever.\u2019 But there\u2019s a lovely sense of closure about its title track, on which, as his friend and biographer Sylvie Simmons put it, \u2018he sang himself back home\u2019, supported by the choir from the Montreal synagogue where he worshipped as a child and that his ancestors had built, offering up a characteristic mix of wracked despair and wry humour: \u2018I wrestled with some demons,\u2019 he shrugged at one point. \u2018They were middle-class and tame.\u2019 But the song\u2019s most potent and affecting lines came in the chorus. \u2018<em tabindex=\"-1\">Hineni</em>, <em tabindex=\"-1\">hineni</em>,\u2019 Cohen sang, a Hebrew word meaning: \u2018Here I am\u2019, \u2018I am ready, Lord.\u2019\u201d</p> </blockquote>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nmHymgM7Y\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/v0nmHymgM7Y?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-11T14:15:34.765Z\">at 2.15pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5825c73ee4b0eb4ebf272eba\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-11T13:39:35.221Z\">1.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/nickcaveofficial/posts/1160931390665235\">Nick Cave has issued a statement on Facebook</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For many of us Leonard Cohen was the greatest songwriter of them all.

This time it\u2019s The Future.<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Never a model of over-productive industry to start off with, Cohen\u2019s musical output slowed considerably in the 90s and noughties: he released three albums in 20 years, one of them, Dear Heather, essentially a collection of outtakes from previous work. The title track of his 1992 album might be the pick of his material during this period. Audibly the work of a deeply troubled man \u2013 he later claimed to have been drinking three bottles of wine a night during the subsequent tour \u2013 it\u2019s as dark and terrifying and potent as anything in his catalogue, an apocalyptic vision of a world in which \u2018things are going to slide in all directions, won\u2019t be nothing you can measure anymore\u2019. Without wishing to overegg the pudding, a quarter of a century on, with talk of a \u2018post-truth\u2019 era abroad, there\u2019s a definite hint of the grimly prophetic about it: a world without privacy, increasingly numb to horror, where what Cohen described as \u2018mass culture\u2019 has stamped out individual identity.\u201d</p> </blockquote>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsdAnYLvGe4\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DsdAnYLvGe4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5825b37be4b0364c91945801\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-11T12:05:59.759Z\">12.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">The best-known short order chef in the world</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Earlier this year, the Guardian ran extracts from the book <a href=\"http://myoldman.org/the-book/\">My Old Man</a>, in which people talked about their relationships with their fathers. One of the pieces came from Adam Cohen, talking about Leonard \u2026</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019ve had a very normal relationship with my father, with the exception that he\u2019s terribly well known and, so it\u2019s said, one of the most important writers in his domain.</p> <p>Like all sons, I have found the relationship has added layers to itself over time. These days, my relationship with him is just looking in a mirror and consulting with him. Hearing the timbre of his voice in my own. Body posture, mannerisms, ethics, morals, linguistics. All the deep imprintings that are there either from socio-genetics or, if you were to be cruel, parroting. Whatever the reason, I throw my arms around the lifestyle I was given.</p> <p>My father made a remarkable effort \u2013 and one that I am much more impressed with now as a family man myself \u2013 to remain in his children\u2019s lives despite a less-than-perfect breakup with my mother. I always saw him. He was always around. He always made gigantic efforts. There was even a time when he wasn\u2019t allowed on the property; to circumnavigate that, he bought a trailer and put it at the T where the dirt road of our house in the south of France connected to the municipal road, and we would walk up the dirt road. A lot was imparted by that. From Los Angeles to the south of France was no small journey. We spent all our holidays with him. Every winter we would go to Montreal and every summer we would go to Greece.</p> <p>There was always laughter. Despite his notoriety for, I quote, \u201chaving a voice like the bottom of an ashtray\u201d, for being \u201cthe prince of darkness\u201d, for being famed for his lugubriousness, he is one of the most quick-witted men, and he is generous with his humour. The guy is hilarious. I\u2019ve gone into the family business, and we get a tremendous amount of laughter out of that. Hanging out with him is the best, whether it\u2019s over a tuna sandwich or on the front stoop of his house. He doesn\u2019t like to move much, having been a touring man his whole life. He does love being sedentary.<br></p> <p>I\u2019ve learned a lot from him on that stoop. The main inspiration that his life provides is a dedication to his craft. He has an old-world view of it. It\u2019s not the notion of instantaneous success that exists in new generations. His whole life has been a demonstration of the opposite. I remember something he told me when I was 16 and starting to take songwriting seriously. He said there\u2019s a moment when you\u2019re blocked on a song, or on any work, and it\u2019s only when you\u2019re about to quit having put much, much more time than you planned into it that the work begins. That\u2019s when you\u2019ve crossed the threshold of being on the right track. But the nature of my dialogue with him is nearly always instruction. From the manner in which we should greet someone about whom we have reservations, to gender relationships, to the proper dosage of mustard and mayonnaise. We talk about women all the time, too, and, if I may, out of privacy, I\u2019ll keep that princely wisdom to myself. It\u2019s a long-running and possibly incomplete transmission.<br></p> <p>We\u2019ve never really fallen out. We\u2019ve had a series of minor misunderstandings that were corrected, and actually served to provide better understanding in the long run. When you have someone in your family who is in such demand, and from whom you derive a sense of identity because of the nature of your relationship, you can start to become covetous of the amount of time spent with that person. There are times when, no question, I wish we had been able to spend more time together.</p> <p>You want to know some secrets about Leonard Cohen? Here\u2019s the dirt. He loves George Jones and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hank_Williams\">Hank Williams</a>. He travels with one small suitcase. Many of his impeccable suits are actually threadbare. He\u2019s only about 5ft 8in, despite that giant baritone. He awakens at four in the morning and blackens pages every single day of his life. He cuts his own hair. He will find a patch of sun anywhere and sit in it, like a big cat, following that sliver wherever it goes. Although he no longer smokes, there is nothing he would rather do. He makes the best tuna salad I\u2019ve ever had \u2013 he seems to have a knack for that. He loves making food for people, in fact. He spends a lot of time in the kitchen. He\u2019s probably the best-known short-order chef in the world.\u201d</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7609d7ae9641565932472f44c8cb79457dd30f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7609d7ae9641565932472f44c8cb79457dd30f7/0_58_1280_768/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The young Adam Cohen and his father Leonard Cohen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The young Adam Cohen and his father.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em><br></em></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-11T12:21:46.909Z\">at 12.21pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5825b25ce4b0eb4ebf272e40\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-11T12:01:16.220Z\">12.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>If there\u2019s one voice you wanted to hear on the subject of Leonard Cohen, it would almost certainly be that of Louise Mensch.

As he was given to wryly pointing out after it attained something approaching omnipresence \u2013 \u2018at the end of every single drama, every single Idol\u2019 as he put it \u2013 his American record label thought so little of the song, and indeed the rest of the material on 1984\u2019s Various Positions, that they refused to release it; it wasn\u2019t until a younger generation of artists, notably Jeff Buckley and Rufus Wainwright, began covering it that it started to outstrip the rest of Cohen\u2019s 80s oeuvre. It wasn\u2019t until its deeply improbable appearance, sung by John Cale, at the end of the animated film Shrek that it started to become ubiquitous. You could argue all night about whether it\u2019s actually a better song than the other masterpieces with which Various Positions and I\u2019m Your Man were liberally studded \u2013 Dance Me to the End of Love or First We Take Manhattan or Tower of Song \u2013 but Hallelujah certainly seemed symbolic of a kind of creative rebirth for its author, after his disastrous collaboration with Phil Spector on Death of a Ladies\u2019 Man, and 1979\u2019s undervalued Recent Songs. Perhaps its longevity has something to do with the song\u2019s malleability, its openness to interpretation. He laboured so intensively over the lyric that, at one juncture, he literally ended up banging his head against the floor, but ended up with something that can be viewed as euphoric or despairing, solemnly religious or carnal, ambiguous or sincere. It\u2019s even survived an unprovoked assault by ghastly operatic man-band Il Divo, the mauling compounded by that fact that, brilliantly, someone in their Simon Cowell-helmed operation took it upon themselves to change the lyrics.\u201d</p> </blockquote>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttEMYvpoR-k\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ttEMYvpoR-k?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5825a375e4b05c05c52f3c24\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-11T11:02:54.951Z\">11.02am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <h2>Time for some more Cohen covers \u2013 as nominated by readers</h2> <ul> <li>Judy Collins recorded <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42-Rv-3Aw50\">Dress Rehearsal Rag</a> in 1969<br></li> <li>How about David McComb and Adam Peters telling you: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Oc7SQvZqZs\">Don\u2019t Go Home With Your Hard-On</a><br>\u2022 Here\u2019s Will Oldham in his Palace Songs guise playing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g90oBqeMtq8\">Winter Lady</a><br>\u2022 And the last in this batch is another Tower of Song, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myyUStnLHus\">this time from Marianne Faithfull</a></li> </ul> <p>You can tweet me your suggestions: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MichaelAHann?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@MichaelAHann</a></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-11T11:26:22.058Z\">at 11.26am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5825a1d7e4b05c05c52f3c1c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-11T10:53:31.548Z\">10.53am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Cohen on depression</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>You may well have read <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/nov/11/leonard-cohen-he-knew-things-about-life-and-if-you-listened-you-could-learn\">Dorian Lysnkey\u2019s beautiful tribute</a>, which we published earlier.

But he was a brilliant melodicist: all those talent show contestants belting out Hallelujah aren\u2019t doing so because they\u2019re enraptured by its references to the Book of Judges. Famous Blue Raincoat, form his stark, intense third album, 1971\u2019s Songs of Love and Hate, is a perfect example: the dark, epistolary evocation of a love triangle is perfectly augmented by a tune rooted not in rock or pop or folk music, but in the French chanson tradition. The moment where the melody rises up on the line \u2018Jane came by with a lock of your hair\u2019 is one of the loveliest in Cohen\u2019s catalogue. He clearly knew the song\u2019s power. It was still unreleased when he chose it to end his set at the 1970 Isle of Wight festival, perhaps the most famous and celebrated live performance of his career, during which he singlehandedly mesmerised a restless audience of half a million.\u201d</p> </blockquote>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHqqlm9yf7M\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DHqqlm9yf7M?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-11T10:49:09.812Z\">at 10.49am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58259347e4b0eb4ebf272d9b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-11T09:51:22.294Z\">9.51am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Time for some more Cohen covers \u2026</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It\u2019s Hallelujah, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w0bzICBWeo\">as performed by Susanna and the Magical Orchestra</a><br>Bill \u201cSmog\u201d Callahan takes on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoKoE7RKx2k\">So Long, Marianne</a><br>Billy Joel\u2019s cover of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dX53Cy7lwZc\">Light As the Breeze</a><br>Teddy Thompson playing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8W89j6GjPDI\">Tonight Will Be Fine</a></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w0bzICBWeo\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-w0bzICBWeo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-11T10:17:29.572Z\">at 10.17am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-582592d2e4b0364c91945749\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-11T09:45:20.365Z\">9.45am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And from another generation, my colleague Alexandra Topping recalls another appearance at a festival \u2026</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I remember the first time I heard Leonard Cohen.

For all Cohen\u2019s apparent inexperienced discomfort in the studio (and subsequent dismissal of its \u2018overproduced\u2019 arrangements, possibly influenced by the fact that, incredibly, it received a lukewarm critical response on release), it sounded more like a mature record than a neophyte\u2019s debut; it came packed with tracks that would go on to become standards, covered by everyone from Beck to Nina Simone: Sisters of Mercy; Hey, That\u2019s No Way To Say Goodbye; So Long Marianne;, Suzanne. For decades, it seemed like the latter would always be Cohen\u2019s most famous and definitive song. What\u2019s striking about it now is how little over-familiarity has dulled its impact: its subtly infectious mood of small hours introspection, its understated depiction of the broiling emotions lurking beneath a platonic but charged relationship with someone else\u2019s partner have never lost their potency.\u201d</p> </blockquote>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_56ep729TE\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/n_56ep729TE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-11-11T09:24:29.778Z\">at 9.24am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58258c4ee4b0364c91945736\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-11T09:17:35.859Z\">9.17am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The story of Leonard Cohen and his muse, Marianne Ihlen, has been well told.

He takes its holiness and renders it physical, earthly. \u201cWhoever listens closely to Hallelujah will discover that it is a song about sex, about love, about life on earth,\u201d Buckley once explained. \u201cThe hallelujah is not a homage to a worshipped person, idol or god, but the hallelujah of the orgasm.

What gave his work its uncommon gravitas wasn\u2019t that he knew the answers but that he never stopped looking. He searched for clues in bedrooms and warzones, in Jewish temples and Buddhist retreats, in Europe, Africa, Israel and Cuba. He tried to flush them out with booze and drugs and seduce them with melodies. And whenever he managed to painfully extract some nugget of wisdom, he would cut and polish it like a precious stone before resuming the search. Funny about himself but profoundly serious about his art, he liked to describe his songs as \u201cinvestigations\u201d into the hidden mechanics of love, sex, war, religion and death \u2013 the beautiful and terrifying truths of existence.

He is living in Montreal under the name of Cohen.\u201d Yet Cohen was determined to establish himself as a songwriter, having been smitten as profoundly as any of his contemporaries by the emergence of rock\u2019n\u2019roll music.</p> <p>\u201cI always loved rock,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember the first time I heard Presley, how relieved and grateful I was that all this stuff he and all of us had been feeling for so long had finally found a particular kind of expression.\u201d<br></p> <p>His debut album, Songs of Leonard Cohen, was released in December 1967, and while not everybody loved its funereal tone, the songs it contained, such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6o6zMPLcXZ8\">Suzanne</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgEiDc1aXr0\">So Long, Marianne</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VT9k5NHCdvQ\">Sisters of Mercy</a>, would prove to be cornerstones of his repertoire for the rest of his long musical career.</p> <p>In his later years he became a Zen monk and spent much of the 1990s sequestered in a <a href=\"http://www.mbzc.org/about/\">monastery on Mount Baldy in California</a>, where he was known as Jikan (the Silent One). Fans often seek spiritual guidance from their idols, but Cohen was a rare example of one who might actually have been capable of providing it.</p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/nov/11/leonard-cohen-obituary\">Leonard Cohen obituary</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58254fbae4b05c05c52f3ad6\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-11T05:02:29.746Z\">5.02am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Cohen on Dylan, Dylan on Cohen</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/10/17/leonard-cohen-makes-it-darker\">Last month\u2019s interview by David Remnick in the New Yorker</a> \u2013 worth a read even before today\u2019s news broke \u2013 dealt, among other things, with the relationship between Cohen and Bob Dylan, the artist with whom he is most often compared:</p> <blockquote> <p>Even before three hundred other performers made Hallelujah famous with their cover versions \u2026 Dylan recognized the beauty of its marriage of the sacred and the profane. He asked Cohen how long it took him to write.</p> <p>\u201cTwo years,\u201d Cohen lied.</p> <p>Actually, Hallelujah had taken him five years. He drafted dozens of verses and then it was years more before he settled on a final version. In several writing sessions, he found himself in his underwear, banging his head against a hotel-room floor.</p> <p>Cohen told Dylan, \u201cI really like I and I,\u201d a song that appeared on Dylan\u2019s album Infidels. \u201cHow long did it take you to write that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbout 15 minutes,\u201d Dylan said.</p> <p>When I asked Cohen about that exchange, he said: \u201cThat\u2019s just the way the cards are dealt.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Dylan also spoke to Remnick for the article, telling him:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When people talk about Leonard, they fail to mention his melodies, which to me, along with his lyrics, are his greatest genius. Even the counterpoint lines \u2013 they give a celestial character and melodic lift to every one of his songs. As far as I know, no one else comes close to this in modern music \u2026<br></p> <p>I see no disenchantment in Leonard\u2019s lyrics at all. There\u2019s always a direct sentiment, as if he\u2019s holding a conversation and telling you something, him doing all the talking, but the listener keeps listening.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58254da1e4b0eb4ebf272c94\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-11T04:53:18.532Z\">4.53am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>As promised, some of the comments readers have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Claire_Phipps\">shared with me</a> on Twitter:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Twinklebottoms/status/796918435015983104\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Claire_Phipps\">@Claire_Phipps</a> I used to walk by his house at Marie Anne and St Laurent in Montreal.

But his writing extended far beyond that.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2008/jul/16/leonardcohenthepoet\">In this Guardian article in 2008</a>, Alex Larman argued that Cohen the poet deserved as much appreciation as Cohen the songwriter:</p> <blockquote> <p>We shouldn\u2019t forget that Cohen is as strong a poet as he is a musician. Since the publication of his first collection in 1956, Let Us Compare Mythologies, in the prestigious McGill Poetry series, Cohen has established himself as a writer with a distinctive voice in the canon of Canadian and American poetry.</p> <p>Cohen would still be highly thought of if he\u2019d never written a song in his life but had stuck to writing his wry, ironic, tender verse. His poetry often talks of love, but it is never straightforwardly romantic \u2026<br></p> <p>As Cohen\u2019s musical career acquired momentum, many of his collections were either compilations of earlier poems or collections of lyrics.

Somehow they read it to him over the phone and he contacted me for a chat. A kind, human gesture.</p> <p>In recent years, I was lucky to see him on his long 2008-2013 tour several times. What set him apart from so many others of his generation was that he actually got better over 60 with such brilliant songs as The Future and Almost Like the Blues; he didn't just churn out his back catalogue.

Once they were universal references, and everybody understood and knew them. That\u2019s no longer the case today, but it is still my landscape.</p> <p>I try to make those references. I try to make sure they\u2019re not too obscure.

          "bodyText": "And that\u2019s it Thank you for your company. To conclude, a lyric. But not one of those ones that are all deep about existence. Instead, let\u2019s place Leonard Cohen with his peers among the great songwriters of the English language. He\u2019s 100 floors up now, with Hank. I said to Hank Williams: how lonely does it get? Hank Williams hasn\u2019t answered yet But I hear him coughing all night long A hundred floors above me In the Tower of Song.\u201d So why didn\u2019t we just do a Cohen playlist? Because if you love Leonard Cohen, you\u2019re likely to be listening to those albums already. Because we wanted to show how much he meant to so many people of so many different musical outlooks. Because we wanted to celebrate not just the man, but his songs. So here are some of the songs you nominated \u2013 if it\u2019s missing, it\u2019s because I couldn\u2019t find it on Spotify. And to round his list off, Alexis Petridis has picked the title track of You Want It Darker. The triumphant, rapturously-received live shows Cohen undertook between 2008 and 2013 might have been forced upon him by prosaic financial pressures, but the final trio of albums Cohen made were clearly the work of a man who\u2019d realised he still had something to say: about life, about religion, about ageing and the experience of facing death. In his final public appearance to promote this year\u2019s You Want It Darker, he seemed at pains to dismiss suggestions that it some kind of musical last will and testament: \u2018I intend to live forever.\u2019 But there\u2019s a lovely sense of closure about its title track, on which, as his friend and biographer Sylvie Simmons put it, \u2018he sang himself back home\u2019, supported by the choir from the Montreal synagogue where he worshipped as a child and that his ancestors had built, offering up a characteristic mix of wracked despair and wry humour: \u2018I wrestled with some demons,\u2019 he shrugged at one point. \u2018They were middle-class and tame.\u2019 But the song\u2019s most potent and affecting lines came in the chorus. \u2018Hineni, hineni,\u2019 Cohen sang, a Hebrew word meaning: \u2018Here I am\u2019, \u2018I am ready, Lord.\u2019\u201d Nick Cave has issued a statement on Facebook For many of us Leonard Cohen was the greatest songwriter of them all. Utterly unique and impossible to imitate no matter how hard we tried. He will be deeply missed by so many. - Nick Cave\u201d More tributes Daryl from The Walking Dead is coping with his incarceration by evil Negan by consoling himself with Cohen. And another actor \u2026 And the voice of bondage \u2026 And Beck \u2026 Time for some more of your Cohen cover suggestions \u2026 \u2022 This one is much nominated: Anohni (then still Antony Hegarty) singing If It Will Be Your Will \u2022 Also very popular with you is Jennifer Warnes\u2019s Famous Blue Raincoat \u2022 Have a listen to to Trisha Yearwood\u2019s Coming Back to You \u2022 And back to Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds for Avalanche Remembrance Day, and the day we learned of Leonard Cohen\u2019s death. Something fitting then: Cohen reciting John McCrae\u2019s In Flanders Fields. As chosen by Alexis Petridis. This time it\u2019s The Future. Never a model of over-productive industry to start off with, Cohen\u2019s musical output slowed considerably in the 90s and noughties: he released three albums in 20 years, one of them, Dear Heather, essentially a collection of outtakes from previous work. The title track of his 1992 album might be the pick of his material during this period. Audibly the work of a deeply troubled man \u2013 he later claimed to have been drinking three bottles of wine a night during the subsequent tour \u2013 it\u2019s as dark and terrifying and potent as anything in his catalogue, an apocalyptic vision of a world in which \u2018things are going to slide in all directions, won\u2019t be nothing you can measure anymore\u2019. Without wishing to overegg the pudding, a quarter of a century on, with talk of a \u2018post-truth\u2019 era abroad, there\u2019s a definite hint of the grimly prophetic about it: a world without privacy, increasingly numb to horror, where what Cohen described as \u2018mass culture\u2019 has stamped out individual identity.\u201d Earlier this year, the Guardian ran extracts from the book My Old Man, in which people talked about their relationships with their fathers. One of the pieces came from Adam Cohen, talking about Leonard \u2026 I\u2019ve had a very normal relationship with my father, with the exception that he\u2019s terribly well known and, so it\u2019s said, one of the most important writers in his domain. Like all sons, I have found the relationship has added layers to itself over time. These days, my relationship with him is just looking in a mirror and consulting with him. Hearing the timbre of his voice in my own. Body posture, mannerisms, ethics, morals, linguistics. All the deep imprintings that are there either from socio-genetics or, if you were to be cruel, parroting. Whatever the reason, I throw my arms around the lifestyle I was given. My father made a remarkable effort \u2013 and one that I am much more impressed with now as a family man myself \u2013 to remain in his children\u2019s lives despite a less-than-perfect breakup with my mother. I always saw him. He was always around. He always made gigantic efforts. There was even a time when he wasn\u2019t allowed on the property; to circumnavigate that, he bought a trailer and put it at the T where the dirt road of our house in the south of France connected to the municipal road, and we would walk up the dirt road. A lot was imparted by that. From Los Angeles to the south of France was no small journey. We spent all our holidays with him. Every winter we would go to Montreal and every summer we would go to Greece. There was always laughter. Despite his notoriety for, I quote, \u201chaving a voice like the bottom of an ashtray\u201d, for being \u201cthe prince of darkness\u201d, for being famed for his lugubriousness, he is one of the most quick-witted men, and he is generous with his humour. The guy is hilarious. I\u2019ve gone into the family business, and we get a tremendous amount of laughter out of that. Hanging out with him is the best, whether it\u2019s over a tuna sandwich or on the front stoop of his house. He doesn\u2019t like to move much, having been a touring man his whole life. He does love being sedentary. I\u2019ve learned a lot from him on that stoop. The main inspiration that his life provides is a dedication to his craft. He has an old-world view of it. It\u2019s not the notion of instantaneous success that exists in new generations. His whole life has been a demonstration of the opposite. I remember something he told me when I was 16 and starting to take songwriting seriously. He said there\u2019s a moment when you\u2019re blocked on a song, or on any work, and it\u2019s only when you\u2019re about to quit having put much, much more time than you planned into it that the work begins. That\u2019s when you\u2019ve crossed the threshold of being on the right track. But the nature of my dialogue with him is nearly always instruction. From the manner in which we should greet someone about whom we have reservations, to gender relationships, to the proper dosage of mustard and mayonnaise. We talk about women all the time, too, and, if I may, out of privacy, I\u2019ll keep that princely wisdom to myself. It\u2019s a long-running and possibly incomplete transmission. We\u2019ve never really fallen out. We\u2019ve had a series of minor misunderstandings that were corrected, and actually served to provide better understanding in the long run. When you have someone in your family who is in such demand, and from whom you derive a sense of identity because of the nature of your relationship, you can start to become covetous of the amount of time spent with that person. There are times when, no question, I wish we had been able to spend more time together. You want to know some secrets about Leonard Cohen? Here\u2019s the dirt. He loves George Jones and Hank Williams. He travels with one small suitcase. Many of his impeccable suits are actually threadbare. He\u2019s only about 5ft 8in, despite that giant baritone. He awakens at four in the morning and blackens pages every single day of his life. He cuts his own hair. He will find a patch of sun anywhere and sit in it, like a big cat, following that sliver wherever it goes. Although he no longer smokes, there is nothing he would rather do. He makes the best tuna salad I\u2019ve ever had \u2013 he seems to have a knack for that. He loves making food for people, in fact. He spends a lot of time in the kitchen. He\u2019s probably the best-known short-order chef in the world.\u201d If there\u2019s one voice you wanted to hear on the subject of Leonard Cohen, it would almost certainly be that of Louise Mensch. So what did she have to say via the medium of Twitter? Because that was the whole point of Leonard Cohen\u2019s life. To be a Canadian fighting the cold war. A nice Facebook post from Beth Orton about Cohen \u2026 Leonard Cohen dying this week is a grief I can process. His leaving makes perfect sense when so little else does. One last poetic statement. A full stop. He is our spiritual leader and one I can follow. In his death, he feels closer than ever. He embodies love and kindness, peace and power. His voice has always been the salve for my broken spirit. His final act of kindness was to be present by his passing this week when we need a voice of reason in the face of mounting insanity and confusion. To remind us of the beauty that exists alongside the imperfection in this world. I am eternally grateful for his existence and his music. He has always resonated on the astral and the earthly planes. Now more so than ever. Beautiful man \u2026 you will be deeply and endlessly missed and you will always be with us.\u201d This time, Alexis Petridis has chosen Hallelujah. The afterlife of Hallelujah is one of the more startling episodes in Leonard Cohen\u2019s career. As he was given to wryly pointing out after it attained something approaching omnipresence \u2013 \u2018at the end of every single drama, every single Idol\u2019 as he put it \u2013 his American record label thought so little of the song, and indeed the rest of the material on 1984\u2019s Various Positions, that they refused to release it; it wasn\u2019t until a younger generation of artists, notably Jeff Buckley and Rufus Wainwright, began covering it that it started to outstrip the rest of Cohen\u2019s 80s oeuvre. It wasn\u2019t until its deeply improbable appearance, sung by John Cale, at the end of the animated film Shrek that it started to become ubiquitous. You could argue all night about whether it\u2019s actually a better song than the other masterpieces with which Various Positions and I\u2019m Your Man were liberally studded \u2013 Dance Me to the End of Love or First We Take Manhattan or Tower of Song \u2013 but Hallelujah certainly seemed symbolic of a kind of creative rebirth for its author, after his disastrous collaboration with Phil Spector on Death of a Ladies\u2019 Man, and 1979\u2019s undervalued Recent Songs. Perhaps its longevity has something to do with the song\u2019s malleability, its openness to interpretation. He laboured so intensively over the lyric that, at one juncture, he literally ended up banging his head against the floor, but ended up with something that can be viewed as euphoric or despairing, solemnly religious or carnal, ambiguous or sincere. It\u2019s even survived an unprovoked assault by ghastly operatic man-band Il Divo, the mauling compounded by that fact that, brilliantly, someone in their Simon Cowell-helmed operation took it upon themselves to change the lyrics.\u201d Time for some more Cohen covers \u2013 as nominated by readers Judy Collins recorded Dress Rehearsal Rag in 1969 How about David McComb and Adam Peters telling you: Don\u2019t Go Home With Your Hard-On \u2022 Here\u2019s Will Oldham in his Palace Songs guise playing Winter Lady \u2022 And the last in this batch is another Tower of Song, this time from Marianne Faithfull You can tweet me your suggestions: @MichaelAHann You may well have read Dorian Lysnkey\u2019s beautiful tribute, which we published earlier. He also encountered Cohen four years ago, and wrote about it at the time. \u2018When I speak of depression,\u2019 he says carefully, \u2018I speak of a clinical depression that is the background of your entire life, a background of anguish and anxiety, a sense that nothing goes well, that pleasure is unavailable and all your strategies collapse. I\u2019m happy to report that, by imperceptible degrees and by the grace of good teachers and good luck, that depression slowly dissolved and has never returned with the same ferocity that prevailed for most of my life.\u2019 He thinks it might just be down to old age. \u2018I read somewhere that as you grow older certain brain cells die that are associated with anxiety so it doesn\u2019t really matter how much you apply yourself to the disciplines. You\u2019re going to start feeling a lot better or a lot worse depending on the condition of your neurons.\u2019\u201d Read the full piece here. If you haven\u2019t yet looked at our gallery of Cohen\u2019s life and career, please do so. If only for the conclusive proof that there was at least one man in the world who could look good in a safari suit. Leonard Cohen was someone who appreciated the power of music, even the music one doesn\u2019t necessarily like. He was interviewed for the Guardian by Mat Snow in 1988. In the conversation, Mat quoted Martin Amis\u2019s description of Simon &amp; Garfunkel\u2019s music being not so much art as therapy, prompting this response from Cohen: I think that\u2019s a rather mean-spirited approach to a man\u2019s work. Everything can be diminished from this point of view. If you don\u2019t like something and think it\u2019s cheap, unless you really have a great sense of responsibility for your culture, I think it\u2019s best to keep it to yourself. That might be the song that gets someone through a dark hour. He wouldn\u2019t say that about Bach. There\u2019s something elitist and snotty about that kind of remark.\u201d Time for some more tributes to the great man. Here\u2019s the second of Alexis Petridis\u2019s key Cohen songs: Famous Blue Raincoat. Understandably, given that he was a poet long before he picked up the guitar \u2013 and that his words are so rich and rewarding \u2013 attention tends to focus on Leonard Cohen\u2019s lyrics, which occasionally means that his skill as a writer of music tends to get overlooked. But he was a brilliant melodicist: all those talent show contestants belting out Hallelujah aren\u2019t doing so because they\u2019re enraptured by its references to the Book of Judges. Famous Blue Raincoat, form his stark, intense third album, 1971\u2019s Songs of Love and Hate, is a perfect example: the dark, epistolary evocation of a love triangle is perfectly augmented by a tune rooted not in rock or pop or folk music, but in the French chanson tradition. The moment where the melody rises up on the line \u2018Jane came by with a lock of your hair\u2019 is one of the loveliest in Cohen\u2019s catalogue. He clearly knew the song\u2019s power. It was still unreleased when he chose it to end his set at the 1970 Isle of Wight festival, perhaps the most famous and celebrated live performance of his career, during which he singlehandedly mesmerised a restless audience of half a million.\u201d It\u2019s Hallelujah, as performed by Susanna and the Magical Orchestra Bill \u201cSmog\u201d Callahan takes on So Long, Marianne Billy Joel\u2019s cover of Light As the Breeze Teddy Thompson playing Tonight Will Be Fine And from another generation, my colleague Alexandra Topping recalls another appearance at a festival \u2026 I remember the first time I heard Leonard Cohen. My dad was doing his tax return late at night when I got in, crouched over his desk, almost in the dark. I was just transfixed. What\u2019s this, I asked? He looked at me like I was an imbecile: \u2018This, megirl, is Leonard Cohen.\u2019 He mocked, but lent me the CD Songs of Leonard Cohen. I played it on repeat for about two weeks solid. Eight years after my dad died, me and my mum were lucky enough to go to Glastonbury at the same time. Leonard Cohen had been ripped off by his former manager and so had to tour again. We were lucky enough to wait in front of the Pyramid stage from the morning, taking it in turns to go for drinks and keeping our spot. When he came on stage, my mum turned into a young girl again. And as those songs of poetry and passion came forth, we clung on to each other, singing every word along with him, like the thousands of others around us. We cherished every word, every bow, every tip of the hat. We were so elated. It is \u2013 and I\u2019m sure it will remain \u2013 one of my most cherished memories. I feel so sad today, but so thankful that this artist helped me create these moments with my parents. RIP Leonard Cohen. Here\u2019s a lovely memory from the Observer reporter Ed Vulliamy of seeing Cohen at the Isle of Wight festival in 1970. We\u2019ll all have our memories and associations. I remember seeing him play at the Isle of Wight, August 1970. Shortly before dawn with 600,000 other people: a scene of vast, exhausted elation along \u2018Devastation Hill\u2019 (we\u2019d had Miles Davis, the Who, Doors, Joni Mitchell, Hendrix, Joan Baez, etc) \u2026 Leonard Cohen recalled a time his father took him to the circus as a boy, where a clown had asked everyone in the audience to light a match \u2013 and he bade Devastation Hill to do just that: so that a sea of little flames illuminated the night, along the escarpment, far as the eye could see from among the grime, soiled sleeping bags and euphoria. Then he played: The Partisan, Suzanne, the lot.\u201d John Cale was the man who took Hallelujah, altered its arrangement, and turned it into the song that took over the world. Here\u2019s his reaction. We\u2019re going to roll them out gradually. His first is Suzanne \u2026 There\u2019s a sense in which the contents of 1967\u2019s The Songs Of Leonard Cohen attested to the fact that its author was already 33 years old when it was released. For all Cohen\u2019s apparent inexperienced discomfort in the studio (and subsequent dismissal of its \u2018overproduced\u2019 arrangements, possibly influenced by the fact that, incredibly, it received a lukewarm critical response on release), it sounded more like a mature record than a neophyte\u2019s debut; it came packed with tracks that would go on to become standards, covered by everyone from Beck to Nina Simone: Sisters of Mercy; Hey, That\u2019s No Way To Say Goodbye; So Long Marianne;, Suzanne. For decades, it seemed like the latter would always be Cohen\u2019s most famous and definitive song. What\u2019s striking about it now is how little over-familiarity has dulled its impact: its subtly infectious mood of small hours introspection, its understated depiction of the broiling emotions lurking beneath a platonic but charged relationship with someone else\u2019s partner have never lost their potency.\u201d The story of Leonard Cohen and his muse, Marianne Ihlen, has been well told. Earlier this year, he wrote a letter to her, as she was dying. The reply is beautiful and moving. The tributes to Leonard Cohen keep coming in \u2026 A while back, Laura Barton wrote about Hallelujah, the much covered song that has come to define Cohen through the countless cover versions. It was always the John Cale version that did it for me; his voice seemed to bring a more ecclesiastical quality to those lines. For a long while I clung to that and resisted the prettiness of Jeff Buckley\u2019s version, but Buckley\u2019s is undoubtedly the most sensual interpretation, breathing life into the song with a short exhalation even before he plays, bringing out the texture of Cohen\u2019s lyrics, the feel of lips and hair and coldness. He takes its holiness and renders it physical, earthly. \u201cWhoever listens closely to Hallelujah will discover that it is a song about sex, about love, about life on earth,\u201d Buckley once explained. \u201cThe hallelujah is not a homage to a worshipped person, idol or god, but the hallelujah of the orgasm. It\u2019s an ode to life and love.\u201d After all, what is a minor fall if not a petite mort?\u201d Read the full article here. You can share your own memories of and tributes to the great man here \u2026 According to the well-informed folks of the Leonard Cohen forum, he passed away on Monday, and has been buried in a private ceremony in Montreal. More Cohen covers: Very much liking Madeleine Peyroux tackling Dance Me to the End of Love Here\u2019s Pixies doing I Can\u2019t Forget and the Jesus and Mary Chain doing Tower of Song And another Tower of Song from Martha Wainwright Ane Brun\u2019s Ain\u2019t No Cure for Love is pretty lovely, too. Keep them coming. It\u2019s nice to remember how much these songs meant to so many people. \u2018He knew things about life, and if you listened you could learn\u2019 The truth was that Cohen felt as lost as anybody. What gave his work its uncommon gravitas wasn\u2019t that he knew the answers but that he never stopped looking. He searched for clues in bedrooms and warzones, in Jewish temples and Buddhist retreats, in Europe, Africa, Israel and Cuba. He tried to flush them out with booze and drugs and seduce them with melodies. And whenever he managed to painfully extract some nugget of wisdom, he would cut and polish it like a precious stone before resuming the search. Funny about himself but profoundly serious about his art, he liked to describe his songs as \u201cinvestigations\u201d into the hidden mechanics of love, sex, war, religion and death \u2013 the beautiful and terrifying truths of existence. A Leonard Cohen song is an anchor flung into a churning sea. It has the kind of weight that could save your life. Do have a read of Dorian Lynskey\u2019s beautiful tribute to Cohen. The great singer-songwriter has died at the age of 82. The news was announced via his official Facebook page, which said a memorial would be held in Los Angeles at a later date. Cohen\u2019s son, Adam, told Rolling Stone his father died peacefully at home: My father passed away peacefully at his home in Los Angeles with the knowledge that he had completed what he felt was one of his greatest records. He was writing up until his last moments with his unique brand of humour.\u201d Musicians, celebrities, politicians and fans are all paying tribute. Some nice nominations coming through for the Cohen covers playlist \u2026 James\u2019s version of So Long Marianne Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds turning Tower of Song into feral swamp rock Feist taking on Closing Time Martin Gore doing Coming Back to You The Broken Family Band offering a UK country take on Diamonds in the Mine (that one was nominated by the former singer of the Broken Family Band) The Blogging Goth tweets me to point out Cohen\u2019s influence on goth music. Sisters of Mercy took their name from him, and covered Teachers very early on. Many more to come. The legendary record mogul Clive Davis has paid tribute, in Billboard: Leonard Cohen was truly a master songwriter. No one sounded like him either vocally or lyrically. He penetrated your soul with his haunting voice and his piercing words. Leonard was absolutely one-of-a-kind, a poet and an artist who put you under his spell time and time again. Suzanne, So Long, Marianne, That\u2019s No Way to Say Goodbye, Hallelujah, Bird on a Wire. Each is unforgettable and each will live on forever as will Leonard Cohen, the Canadian poet laureate.\u201d In an interview last month, Cohen said he was \u201cready to die\u201d. He told the New Yorker: I am ready to die. I hope it\u2019s not too uncomfortable. That\u2019s about it for me. In the same interview, he said he had a vault of unpublished poems and unfinished lyrics to finish and record or publish: The big change is the proximity to death. I am a tidy kind of guy. I like to tie up the strings if I can. If I can\u2019t, that\u2019s OK. But my natural thrust is to finish things that I\u2019ve begun. Good morning, everyone. Michael Hann here, in London, taking over from Claire Phipps in Australia, on another sobering and sad morning in music \u2013 there have been rather too many sober days in the last 12 months, what with Lemmy, Bowie, Prince and now Leonard Cohen. Alongside the mourning, I\u2019d like to celebrate Leonard Cohen\u2019s life and music. So would you help me with compiling a playlist of the best covers of Cohen songs? I\u2019ll kick us off with REM. Tweet me your nominations: @MichaelAHann You Want It Darker, the album released only weeks ago, won rave reviews, including from the Observer, which gave it five stars. Reviewer Kitty Empire said it was: an album of killer couplets, even the bleakest delivered with a half-smile. Finality is a theme. The Guardian\u2019s Alexis Petridis also gave it five stars: Throughout, he sounds wise and honest, and \u2013 despite the occasional lyrical protestations of weariness \u2013 full of life. Last week in LA, Cohen talked about making two more albums, about following the musical path sketched out on the album\u2019s finale, String Reprise/Treaty. It\u2019s hard not to hope it works out that way \u2013 the man behind You Want It Darker does not seem like someone running short on inspiration \u2013 but if circumstances dictate otherwise, there are worse ways to bow out than this. Marianne Ihlen, Cohen\u2019s most famous muse, died in July this year. Jan Christian Mollestad, a documentary maker and friend of Ihlen, shared a letter Cohen had written to her shortly before she died: Well Marianne, it\u2019s come to this time when we are really so old and our bodies are falling apart and I think I will follow you very soon. Know that I am so close behind you that if you stretch out your hand, I think you can reach mine. And you know that I\u2019ve always loved you for your beauty and your wisdom, but I don\u2019t need to say anything more about that because you know all about that. But now, I just want to wish you a very good journey. Goodbye old friend. Endless love, see you down the road. Two days after the letters was read to her, Ihlen, immortalised by Cohen in So Long, Marianne and Bird on a Wire, died. She was 81. Fans have been gathering outside Cohen\u2019s home in Montreal \u2013 it\u2019s past 2am there now \u2013 to place messages and candles for the singer. One reader sends this photo from the city: Sylvie Simmons, Cohen\u2019s biographer, has posted her goodbye to him on Facebook: I was just on NPR radio, giving the most moronic answers to questions I\u2019ve ever given anyone about Leonard Cohen, because I didn\u2019t want to talk. It\u2019s still sinking in. My brain is numb. In this year of losses, so many losses, in this black week for the world, this tops them all. I\u2019m writing this with constant interruptions, calls and texts from radio and newspapers wanting to know this and that. Everyone wants details, how and where and why he died. Well, he went out in a blaze of glory. Died with his boots on \u2013 or his suit on \u2013 having delivered a masterpiece before he left. You Want It Darker is one of his richest, deepest and most beautiful albums in a lifetime of rich, deep and beautiful work. He sang himself back home in that album, to Montreal, where they held the memorial today. When at the age of 15 Leonard first encountered the poetry of Lorca he heard the music of the synagogue his ancestors founded. So many stories about musicians and poets have an unhappy ending but not Leonard, he was ready, and he didn\u2019t linger once his work was done. He knew darkness, looked right into its eyes, could even see the funny side. \u201cThis world is full of conflicts and things that cannot be reconciled but there are moments,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen we can embrace the whole mess.\u201d God, I am going to miss this man. Everything. The whole mess. I\u2019m so very grateful to have known him, to have had his support and friendship. So grateful to have his words and music to go back to again and again. Hey that\u2019s no way to say goodbye, but it\u2019s the best I can do for now. Leonard Cohen, one of Canada and the world\u2019s greatest singer-songwriters, has died. A post on his official Facebook page broke the news and said a memorial service would take place at a later date in Los Angeles. It did not say when or how Cohen had died. Cohen\u2019s son Adam told Rolling Stone his father died peacefully at home: My father passed away peacefully at his home in Los Angeles with the knowledge that he had completed what he felt was one of his greatest records. He was writing up until his last moments with his unique brand of humour. Tributes have poured in from musicians, writers, poets and politicians. Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau, whose father Pierre was a longtime friend of the singer, said: His ability to conjure the vast array of human emotion made him one of the most influential and enduring musicians ever. Fans have left messages and candles at the Chelsea Hotel in New York and outside Cohen\u2019s Montreal home. In an interview last month, Cohen said he was \u201cready to die\u201d.He told the New Yorker: I am ready to die. I hope it\u2019s not too uncomfortable. That\u2019s about it for me. As well as musicians, tributes have come from writers and poets: Agence France-Presse posts these 10 key moments from Leonard Cohen\u2019s life: 21 September 1934: Cohen is born in Montreal to a Jewish family of Polish origin. His father dies when he is nine years old. 1956-1961: After studying history at McGill University, Montreal, and spending a year at Columbia University in New York, he publishes his first poetry volumes \u2013 Let Us Compare Mythologies then The Spice-Box of Earth - before heading to Europe on a scholarship. 1963: During a seven-year spell living on the Greek island of Hydra, he writes Flowers for Hitler, one of his most controversial poetry collections; his first novel, The Favorite Game; and Beautiful Losers, a book about religion and sexuality that prompts the Boston Globe to compare him to fellow novelist James Joyce. Early 1968: His musical career begins with his first album Songs of Leonard Cohen, a year after the success of Suzanne performed by American singer Judy Collins. 1970: He begins his first tour of the United States, Canada and Europe, participating in the Isle of Wight music festival. 1988: The huge success of I\u2019m Your Man, an album in a new style using synthesisers and more sombre lyrics, is recorded in Los Angeles where Cohen is now living. 1994: Cohen retires to a Buddhist monastery on Mount Baldy, California, and in August 1996 is ordained as a Zen monk with the name Jikan, meaning \u201cThe Silent One\u201d. 1999: Defrauded and almost bankrupted by his former manager, he begins performing again and releases a new album, Ten New Songs. 2010: Already firmly established in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in New York, Cohen receives a Grammy lifetime achievement award. He is also made a Companion to the Order of Canada (2003) and given the Prince of Asturias award for letters (2011). 2016: For his 82nd birthday, he makes his 14th album together with his son Adam and the choir of Montreal synagogue, adding to the intensity of his voice that is now darker than ever as he sings \u201cHineni, hineni, my Lord\u201d, meaning \u201cI\u2019m ready, my Lord\u201d in Hebrew. Another giant of music has gone and his fans are in mourning. There were hints that Leonard Cohen would not live much longer, but in a year that has already taken away Prince, David Bowie and George Martin, his death \u2013 announced via a Facebook post on Thursday \u2013 still came as a shock. \u201cIt is with profound sorrow we report that legendary poet, songwriter and artist Leonard Cohen has passed away. We have lost one of music\u2019s most revered and prolific visionaries,\u201d the post said. Twitter was soon awash in tributes from singers, writers, poets and public figures mourning the loss of a musical giant. Musicians across all genres, from hip-hop to pop to rock, tweeted out their condolences, including Ben Folds, Peter Hook from Joy Division and New Order, KD Lang, Slash, Lily Allen and Bette Midler. \u201cAnother magical voice stilled,\u201d wrote Midler. A handful more of the comments readers have shared with me on Twitter: Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has published a longer statement on Cohen\u2019s death. The singer was a longtime friend of Trudeau\u2019s father, Pierre, also a former Canadian PM: It is with deep sorrow that I learned today of the death of the legendary Leonard Cohen. A most remarkable Montrealer, Leonard Cohen managed to reach the highest of artistic achievement, both as an acclaimed poet and a world-renowned singer-songwriter. He will be fondly remembered for his gruff vocals, his self-deprecating humour and the haunting lyrics that made his songs the perennial favourite of so many generations. Leonard Cohen is as relevant today as he was in the 1960s. His ability to conjure the vast array of human emotion made him one of the most influential and enduring musicians ever. His style transcended the vagaries of fashion. Leonard Cohen was made a Companion of the Order of Canada in 2003 and received many artistic honours during his lifetime, including being inducted into the Canadian Music hall of fame, the Canadian Songwriters hall of fame, and the American Rock and Roll hall of fame. He received a lifetime achievement Grammy in 2010 and was awarded the Glenn Gould prize for lifetime achievement in the arts in 2011. In 2013, with a career already spanning more than fifty years, he won Junos as Artist of the Year and Songwriter of the Year for his 2012 album Old Ideas. His music had withstood the test of time. On behalf of all Canadians, Sophie and I wish to express our deepest sympathies to Leonard Cohen\u2019s family, friends, colleagues and many, many fans. Leonard, no other artist\u2019s poetry and music felt or sounded quite like yours. We\u2019ll miss you. Cohen\u2019s son Adam has told Rolling Stone that his father died peacefully at home: My father passed away peacefully at his home in Los Angeles with the knowledge that he had completed what he felt was one of his greatest records. He was writing up until his last moments with his unique brand of humour. His manager Robert Kory also told the magazine: Unmatched in his creativity, insight and crippling candour, Leonard Cohen was a true visionary whose voice will be sorely missed. I was blessed to call him a friend, and for me to serve that bold artistic spirit firsthand, was a privilege and great gift. He leaves behind a legacy of work that will bring insight, inspiration and healing for generations to come. With thanks again to readers who are sharing memories and tributes on our news story: You can read the Guardian\u2019s full obituary of Cohen here. Here\u2019s a snippet: Early in his career, his novel Beautiful Losers (1966) caused the Boston Globe to declare that \u201cJames Joyce is not dead. He is living in Montreal under the name of Cohen.\u201d Yet Cohen was determined to establish himself as a songwriter, having been smitten as profoundly as any of his contemporaries by the emergence of rock\u2019n\u2019roll music. \u201cI always loved rock,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember the first time I heard Presley, how relieved and grateful I was that all this stuff he and all of us had been feeling for so long had finally found a particular kind of expression.\u201d His debut album, Songs of Leonard Cohen, was released in December 1967, and while not everybody loved its funereal tone, the songs it contained, such as Suzanne, So Long, Marianne and Sisters of Mercy, would prove to be cornerstones of his repertoire for the rest of his long musical career. In his later years he became a Zen monk and spent much of the 1990s sequestered in a monastery on Mount Baldy in California, where he was known as Jikan (the Silent One). Fans often seek spiritual guidance from their idols, but Cohen was a rare example of one who might actually have been capable of providing it. Last month\u2019s interview by David Remnick in the New Yorker \u2013 worth a read even before today\u2019s news broke \u2013 dealt, among other things, with the relationship between Cohen and Bob Dylan, the artist with whom he is most often compared: Even before three hundred other performers made Hallelujah famous with their cover versions \u2026 Dylan recognized the beauty of its marriage of the sacred and the profane. He asked Cohen how long it took him to write. \u201cTwo years,\u201d Cohen lied. Actually, Hallelujah had taken him five years. He drafted dozens of verses and then it was years more before he settled on a final version. In several writing sessions, he found himself in his underwear, banging his head against a hotel-room floor. Cohen told Dylan, \u201cI really like I and I,\u201d a song that appeared on Dylan\u2019s album Infidels. \u201cHow long did it take you to write that?\u201d \u201cAbout 15 minutes,\u201d Dylan said. When I asked Cohen about that exchange, he said: \u201cThat\u2019s just the way the cards are dealt.\u201d Dylan also spoke to Remnick for the article, telling him: When people talk about Leonard, they fail to mention his melodies, which to me, along with his lyrics, are his greatest genius. Even the counterpoint lines \u2013 they give a celestial character and melodic lift to every one of his songs. As far as I know, no one else comes close to this in modern music \u2026 I see no disenchantment in Leonard\u2019s lyrics at all. There\u2019s always a direct sentiment, as if he\u2019s holding a conversation and telling you something, him doing all the talking, but the listener keeps listening. As promised, some of the comments readers have shared with me on Twitter: (You can read the lyrics to Take This Longing here.) At the Chelsea Hotel in New York \u2013 scene for some of Cohen\u2019s more notorious lyrics \u2013 fans are leaving notes and memorials: Some readers have been contacting me via Twitter \u2013 for which thank you \u2013 to add their own tributes. I\u2019ll add more to the live blog shortly, but first wanted to showcase these images sent by the Ensemble Scholastica in Montreal: Neil Portnow, president of the Recording Academy \u2013 home of the Grammys, which gave Cohen a lifetime achievement award back in 2010 \u2013 has issued a statement on the \u201ccherished artist\u201d: We are deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Grammy award winner and 2010 Recording Academy lifetime achievement award recipient Leonard Cohen. During an influential career that spanned more than five decades, Leonard became one of the most revered pop poets and a musical touchstone for many songwriters. His extraordinary talent had a profound impact on countless singers and songwriters, as well as the wider culture. We have lost a cherished artist and our sincerest condolences go out to Leonard\u2019s family, friends and collaborators. He will be missed terribly. Cohen will, of course, be remembered primarily for his music. But his writing extended far beyond that. In this Guardian article in 2008, Alex Larman argued that Cohen the poet deserved as much appreciation as Cohen the songwriter: We shouldn\u2019t forget that Cohen is as strong a poet as he is a musician. Since the publication of his first collection in 1956, Let Us Compare Mythologies, in the prestigious McGill Poetry series, Cohen has established himself as a writer with a distinctive voice in the canon of Canadian and American poetry. Cohen would still be highly thought of if he\u2019d never written a song in his life but had stuck to writing his wry, ironic, tender verse. His poetry often talks of love, but it is never straightforwardly romantic \u2026 As Cohen\u2019s musical career acquired momentum, many of his collections were either compilations of earlier poems or collections of lyrics. Nevertheless, the writing elevates Cohen into that rare pantheon where a musician\u2019s lyrics are actually poetry. Flags in Montreal, Canada, where Cohen was brought up, are flying at half-mast. The Montreal mayor, Denis Coderre, said the city had \u201clost one of our greatest ambassadors and icons\u201d. Through 14 albums, from the 1960s to 2016: Cohen\u2019s life in pictures. Some tributes from readers (you can add your own here on our main news story): Cohen spoke about his health just weeks prior to his death during a promotional interview for his 14th album, You Want it Darker: Just letting a little light in: For many people \u2013 not least because of the many, many cover versions \u2013 Hallelujah will be the song they most associate with Cohen. In 2008, a backlash to a cover of the song by that year\u2019s UK X-Factor winner, Alexandra Burke, sparked a campaign to get Jeff Buckley\u2019s famed version to the top of the charts. It was a one-two \u2013 though Burke triumphed. Cohen\u2019s original charted at number 36. Asked about it the following year, Cohen suggested he had heard enough covers of the song: I was happy that the song was being used, of course. There were certain ironic and amusing sidebars, because the record that it came from which was called Various Positions \u2013 [a] record Sony wouldn\u2019t put out. They didn\u2019t think it was good enough. It had songs like Dance Me to the End of Love, Hallelujah, If It Be Your Will. So there was a mild sense of revenge that arose in my heart. But I was just reading a review of a movie called Watchmen that uses it, and the reviewer said \u2018Can we please have a moratorium on Hallelujah in movies and television shows?\u2019 And I kind of feel the same way. I think it\u2019s a good song, but I think too many people sing it. Cohen, who was born in Quebec in Canada, came to prominence in the 1960s as a poet, novelist and singer-songwriter. Originally focusing on literary pursuits, he shifted his attention to music in the late 60s when he moved to New York. His first album, Songs of Leonard Cohen, was released in 1967 and became a cult hit. Cohen\u2019s influence on the music industry has been likened to that of his contemporaries Bob Dylan and Joni Mitchell. Despite his immense popularity, Cohen often appeared to be shy of the stage. Judy Collins, who found success with his song Suzanne, once described how she had to coax him back on stage after he quit halfway through a performance. He came out of retirement in his late 70s to embark what would end up being a five-year, worldwide tour, after his former manager, Kelley Lynch, was found guilty of stealing millions of dollars from him. Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has commented on the loss of one of the country\u2019s greatest cultural icons: Last year, Guardian music colleagues compiled a list of Cohen\u2019s 10 best songs. At number one? Suzanne. Check your own list against the Guardian\u2019s here: As well as musing on mortality, Cohen recently weighed in on Bob Dylan\u2019s surprise Nobel prize win, the art of songwriting and the constant presence of religious themes in his work. Speaking at a Q&amp;A and playback session for his latest and now final album in Los Angeles, Cohen said that giving the award to Dylan \u201cis like pinning a medal on Mount Everest for being the highest mountain\u201d: I think that Bob Dylan knows this more than all of us: you don\u2019t write the songs anyhow. So if you\u2019re lucky, you can keep the vehicle healthy and responsive over the years. If you\u2019re lucky, your own intentions have very little to do with this. You can keep the body as well-oiled and receptive as possible, but whether you\u2019re actually going to be able to go for the long haul is really not your own choice. He also spoke about religion\u2019s impact on his work. Cohen was an ordained Zen Buddhist who was given the Dharma name of Jikan \u2013 which means \u201csilence\u201d \u2013 after taking up the religion and kicking his habit of drinking four bottles of wine a day. I\u2019ve never thought of myself as a religious person. I don\u2019t have any spiritual strategy. I kind of limp along like so many of us do in these realms. Occasionally I\u2019ve felt the grace of another presence in my life. But I can\u2019t develop any kind of spiritual structure on that. This biblical landscape is very familiar to me, and it\u2019s natural that I use those landmarks as references. Once they were universal references, and everybody understood and knew them. That\u2019s no longer the case today, but it is still my landscape. I try to make those references. I try to make sure they\u2019re not too obscure. But outside of that, I can\u2019t \u2013 I dare not \u2013 claim anything in the spiritual realm for my own. You Want It Darker was co-produced by Leonard Cohen\u2019s son, Adam. Speaking recently with CBC radio host Tom Power, Adam talked about working with his father on the album many believed would be his last. This old man, who was truly in pain and discomfort, would at some intervals get out of his medical chair and dance in front of his speakers. And sometimes, we would put on a song and listen to it on repeat just like teenagers with the help of medical marijuana. I think in states of pain and discomfort, what do you seek with more energy and more clarity than joy and jubilance? Adam described his father as \u201cthe last of his kind\u201d: Unlike so many from that golden era, from which he comes, he\u2019s not a nostalgia act. This guy is speaking from his particular vantage point, he\u2019s speaking about things that are meaningful to him at his particular rung in life \u2014 he will be leaving a giant void when he leaves us. Cohen\u2019s comments after the death of his most famous muse Marianne Ihlen, who died in August, now strike a particularly prophetic tone. Jan Christian Mollestad, a documentary maker, read a letter Cohen wrote to her before she died: Well Marianne, it\u2019s come to this time when we are really so old and our bodies are falling apart and I think I will follow you very soon. Know that I am so close behind you that if you stretch out your hand, I think you can reach mine. Ihlen, whom Cohen wrote about in So Long, Marianne and Bird on a Wire, died in Norway on 29 July, aged 81. You Want It Darker, the album released only weeks ago, won rave reviews, including from the Observer, which gave it five stars. Reviewer Kitty Empire said it was: an album of killer couplets, even the bleakest delivered with a half-smile. Finality is a theme. The Guardian\u2019s Alexis Petridis also gave it five stars: Throughout, he sounds wise and honest, and \u2013 despite the occasional lyrical protestations of weariness \u2013 full of life. Last week in LA, Cohen talked about making two more albums, about following the musical path sketched out on the album\u2019s finale, String Reprise/Treaty. It\u2019s hard not to hope it works out that way \u2013 the man behind You Want It Darker does not seem like someone running short on inspiration \u2013 but if circumstances dictate otherwise, there are worse ways to bow out than this. In an interview last month, Cohen said he was \u201cready to die\u201d. He told the New Yorker: I am ready to die. I hope it\u2019s not too uncomfortable. That\u2019s about it for me. In the same interview, he said he had a vault of unpublished poems and unfinished lyrics to finish and record or publish: The big change is the proximity to death. I am a tidy kind of guy. I like to tie up the strings if I can. If I can\u2019t, that\u2019s OK. But my natural thrust is to finish things that I\u2019ve begun. Leonard Cohen has died at the age of 82. A post to his official Facebook page today announced the musician\u2019s passing. It is with profound sorrow we report that legendary poet, songwriter and artist, Leonard Cohen has passed away. We have lost one of music\u2019s most revered and prolific visionaries. A memorial will take place in Los Angeles at a later date. The family requests privacy during their time of grief. We will have tributes and reaction to his death as they come in.",

I like Trump a lot because he knew the real problems of the country rather than just chanting politically correct slogans.</p> <p>The US is divided now, probably more divided than when I worked there for three years.

But in the northern areas of India \u2013 the stomping ground of the ruling rightwing \u2013 opinions may differ. The philosophy of Gandhi of a mutual peaceful coexistence, which was even enshrined in our foreign policy until an ideological regime change, is something I firmly believe in, and the rise of a person like Trump is a question mark on existence itself. </p> <p>The hidden silent majority that is supposed to have created this ruckus may not be as silent as they are portrayed to be. As in every other country, some are always bound to feel victimised during the rule of a government they despise, which could be for racial, religious, cultural or economical reasons. It\u2019s beyond doubt this result was the result of what they call \u2018whitelash\u2019 \u2013 some sort of racial hate storm against the former government\u2019s policy on immigration, terrorism and the domestic economy.</p> <p>The election helped me to see what the US truly is. Under the pop culture disguise they have a huge rising tide of rightwing fanatics and a population desperate enough to find hope in them. </p> <p>Maybe his campaign of rhetoric and hate was a charade to reign in their support. As long as he limits himself to rhetoric and doesn\u2019t dare turn rhetoric into reform, I think the world will be safe.</p> <h2>Argentina</h2> <p><strong>\u2018One of the few things politicians agreed on was to openly reject Donald Trump\u2019</strong> \u2013 James, 21</p> <p>Donald Trump has been hostile to our countries, so I am not optimistic about having a fluid relationship with the US. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/07/donald-trump-presidency-america-endure-latinos-experience\">His proposals against Latinos</a> make it really difficult to support him.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/10/brexit-trump-whitelash-politicians-must-not-pander\">Brexit and Trump mark a whitelash. Politicians must not pander to it | Polly Toynbee</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Our government made it clear that it supported Hillary Clinton. I am really worried about the impact this will have on our future. Argentina\u2019s society is fragmented politically, as there is a strong division between the actual and former government. But one of the few things politicians agreed on was to openly reject Trump\u2019s speech.</p> <p>The US now has a president who is racist, xenophobic, sexist, misogynist, who openly supports Guant\u00e1namo and illegal torture, who hates minorities, who thinks climate change was invented by China to make US industries less competitive. Seriously, what can go wrong?</p> <p>Argentina has been always a very progressive nation. We have many problems, but one of our main characteristics is that we are open to different religions or race. Discrimination exists, like everywhere, but here we don\u2019t face integration problems, or at least not like in other parts of the world.</p> <p>Americans voted for him because he said the things that many of them think. Trump is a clear representation of the average American\u2019s thoughts, and that was decisive, like a kind of dangerous Homer Simpson. It also shows how unhappy they are with the political establishment.</p> <p>These types of leaders that are spreading around the world are setting in a new era, with policies that I think compromise worldwide security. They are on the rise because of society\u2019s need for an answer to problems, but the only thing they achieve is to deepen and create a more segregated and unfair humanity.</p> <h2>Mexico<br></h2> <p><strong>\u2018We have been humiliated in front of the world\u2019</strong> \u2013 Flor Aguilera, Mexico City</p> <p>The power Trump has over us \u2013 over our economy, our geography, our perception of our freedom of movement, over the way the world will see us \u2013 is terrifying, and he is not even the president yet.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/01/donald-trump-vows-to-deport-millions-during-first-hour-in-office-in-hardline-speech\">The future deportations of many Mexicans</a> who live and work in the US who send money home, and who contribute tremendously in that way to our economy, will probably send us into an even deeper recession. We have been humiliated in front of the world.</p> <p>Today we woke up to find the exchange rate at 20.50 pesos (78p) for the dollar. We went from 18.70 per dollar on election day to 20.20 on Thursday and 20.50 on Friday. It\u2019s expected to reach 30 by the end of the year.</p> <p>We are more than willing to welcome in any American who wishes to make Mexico their home for the next four years \u2013 bring your families, come live here, bring your dollars, help us out. We are a friendly, welcoming country with amazing weather, fantastic food, great cities with interesting museums and landmarks and restaurants and cafes. We hope they will seriously consider it. That goes for British people who want to escape the post-Brexit UK.</p> <p>In our collective imagination, US democracy was something to aspire to. This is something that has changed. The spell has been broken in many ways. We are disappointed. In Mexico, even the least educated among us believe this man to be a baffoon, his ideas to be uninspired and poorly expressed, that his misogyny is worse than any machismo we have ever seen. We made fun of him. We are surprised by how much and how many Americans love him, adore him.</p> <p>We are now wondering where to turn to for inspiration and what way of life and ideology should now inspire us.</p> <p>We ask ourselves: \u2018Is this America?\u2019</p> <h2>Brazil</h2> <p><strong>\u2018The US generally does the same thing no matter who\u2019s in charge\u2019 </strong>\u2013 Alcysio, 27, Rio de Janeiro </p> <p>The result might have been surprising, but it\u2019s hardly going to change anything in South America. Our government is already pandering to Trump as they would to Hillary. Being subservient and uncritical is all the Temer administration will do, even if the US government starts to deport Brazilians. I hope they freeze out the non-elected Brazilian government and treat it with the insignificance it deserves.</p> <p>Of course you worry that such an election might make rightwing extremists feel entitled to commit hate crimes. But, on the other hand, the US generally does the same thing no matter who\u2019s in charge.<br></p> <p>Republicans voted as usual, it was the others who didn\u2019t bother voting as they feel desinfranchised by the politics that won it. It is something we know quite well in Brazil, too.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This is not someone who\u2019s fit for office.

I think it will have a big impact on our economy because the US is our main economic partner; this is where we export the majority of our goods and Trump wants to get rid of Nafta. Our prime minister [Justin Trudeau] <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/nov/10/canadian-pm-justin-trudeau-pledges-to-work-with-trump-video\">said he would work with Trump</a>, but the truth is they have very conflicting views on almost everything, so I could see the relations being much less friendly than they have been lately. </p> <p>With Trump as president, people all over the globe are in danger. I am scared and I am sad. I\u2019m sad to see so many people showing intolerance, showing hate towards their neighbours. Every Canadian I\u2019ve talked to or who has posted on social media seems to think the same thing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/11/trump-brexit-age-of-popular-revolt-2016-in-long-reads\">Trump, Brexit and the age of popular revolt: 2016 in Long Reads</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The man is xenophobic, misogynist, devoid of common sense or a sense of reality; he thinks he\u2019s better than everyone, jokes about assaulting women, which we know he has; he thinks he\u2019s too smart to file his taxes. This is not someone who\u2019s fit for office. This is someone who needs help.</p> <h2>Germany</h2> <p><strong>\u2018The biggest concern for Germany and all European nations is how Trump will behave towards Putin\u2019 </strong>\u2013 Rudolf, 39 </p> <p>If Putin senses weakness or pliability, he will take full advantage and seek to further destabilise Nato and the EU. He will finance populist movements across the EU as well as launching military operations where advantageous to Russian interests. In that case, the EU might need to look to China as its only powerful ally in favour of global stability \u2013 a really sad situation.</p> <p>Another big concern is that the US will tear up its climate change commitments and its rapprochement with Iran. Both would be highly disadvantageous to German and European interests in working towards global conflict reduction. </p> <p>The overwhelming majority of Germans are worried about the Trump presidency. Americans have pinned their hopes on a strongman-actor who isn\u2019t a politician to fix the precise same neoliberal system that produced him in the first place. That is why both Merkel and the foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/09/world-leaders-react-to-donald-trumps-us-election-victory\">have been lukewarm in their reactions to say the least</a>. I am saddened but not surprised after Brexit showed that neoliberal complacency has created a significant percentage of protest voters who wish to destroy the current economic order even without a coherent alternative. </p> <p>The US is now deeply divided into two camps: the Trump camp that is predominantly white, and the other that has a high percentage of ethnic minorities. That racial divide is deeply worrying. </p> <h2><strong>Portugal</strong></h2> <p><strong>\u2018The mood here is one of shock and fear for the future\u2019 </strong>\u2013 William</p> <p>I know that nationalist parties all across Europe can\u2019t believe their luck. The middle ground has shifted to the right. I hope that moderate leaders take heed and produce a narrative, backed by policies, that is inspiring.</p> <p>The election, much like the Brexit result, shows how vulnerable democracies are to simple populist arguments when the circumstances are right. In both the US and the UK, the vote was decided by a tranche of voters whose lives have more despair than hope for the future. I am bitterly disappointed with both results, but the leaders on the losing side did not articulate any policies that would give the voters hope for change. They badly misread the mood of the left behinds. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The election, much like the Brexit result, shows how vulnerable democracies are to simple populist arguments</p> <footer> <cite>William, Portugal</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <h2><strong>France and Spain</strong></h2> <p><strong>\u2018In Spain they\u2019re cracking very dark jokes about the end of the world\u2019</strong> \u2013 Beatriz</p> <p>In France, it is only going to encourage supporters of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/09/marine-le-pen-says-trumps-victory-marks-great-movement-across-world\">Marine Le Pen</a> in the upcoming elections. In Europe, it is going to make the relationship with the US, UK and Russia that much more tense.<br></p> <p>My French friends are trying to keep business as usual and not discuss it. In Spain, they\u2019re cracking very dark jokes about the end of the world but then again, the memory in Spain is longer.</p> <p>Interestingly enough, regardless of their political convictions, all my acquaintances are horrified that the US has chosen such an inexperienced person and failed businessman because his endeavours have not been stable or profitable for anyone but himself. His language and his lack of control are unacceptable.<br></p> <p>I hope he does not influence other world leaders to become more like him or Putin \u2013 excessive, dominant and ultimately ineffective heads of repressive countries. I hope that he does not commit nepotism while in the office, but rather use best business practices \u2013 although that is very, very unlikely.<br></p> <p>I\u2019m preparing for the worst, because really, all the historical and economic signs point to a very, very dark time.</p> <ul> <li><em>This article was amended on 14 November 2016 to correct the name of one of the contributors.</em><br></li> </ul>",

They are on the rise because of society\u2019s need for an answer to problems, but the only thing they achieve is to deepen and create a more segregated and unfair humanity. Mexico \u2018We have been humiliated in front of the world\u2019 \u2013 Flor Aguilera, Mexico City The power Trump has over us \u2013 over our economy, our geography, our perception of our freedom of movement, over the way the world will see us \u2013 is terrifying, and he is not even the president yet. The future deportations of many Mexicans who live and work in the US who send money home, and who contribute tremendously in that way to our economy, will probably send us into an even deeper recession. We have been humiliated in front of the world. Today we woke up to find the exchange rate at 20.50 pesos (78p) for the dollar. We went from 18.70 per dollar on election day to 20.20 on Thursday and 20.50 on Friday. It\u2019s expected to reach 30 by the end of the year. We are more than willing to welcome in any American who wishes to make Mexico their home for the next four years \u2013 bring your families, come live here, bring your dollars, help us out. We are a friendly, welcoming country with amazing weather, fantastic food, great cities with interesting museums and landmarks and restaurants and cafes. We hope they will seriously consider it. That goes for British people who want to escape the post-Brexit UK. In our collective imagination, US democracy was something to aspire to. This is something that has changed. The spell has been broken in many ways. We are disappointed. In Mexico, even the least educated among us believe this man to be a baffoon, his ideas to be uninspired and poorly expressed, that his misogyny is worse than any machismo we have ever seen. We made fun of him. We are surprised by how much and how many Americans love him, adore him. We are now wondering where to turn to for inspiration and what way of life and ideology should now inspire us. We ask ourselves: \u2018Is this America?\u2019 Brazil \u2018The US generally does the same thing no matter who\u2019s in charge\u2019 \u2013 Alcysio, 27, Rio de Janeiro The result might have been surprising, but it\u2019s hardly going to change anything in South America. Our government is already pandering to Trump as they would to Hillary. Being subservient and uncritical is all the Temer administration will do, even if the US government starts to deport Brazilians. I hope they freeze out the non-elected Brazilian government and treat it with the insignificance it deserves. Of course you worry that such an election might make rightwing extremists feel entitled to commit hate crimes. But, on the other hand, the US generally does the same thing no matter who\u2019s in charge. Republicans voted as usual, it was the others who didn\u2019t bother voting as they feel desinfranchised by the politics that won it. It is something we know quite well in Brazil, too. Canada \u2018I could see the relations being much less friendly than they have been lately\u2019 \u2013 Storm, 25, Quebec It\u2019s really hard to know at this point in time how Trump\u2019s presidency will affect Canada. I think it will have a big impact on our economy because the US is our main economic partner; this is where we export the majority of our goods and Trump wants to get rid of Nafta. Our prime minister [Justin Trudeau] said he would work with Trump, but the truth is they have very conflicting views on almost everything, so I could see the relations being much less friendly than they have been lately. With Trump as president, people all over the globe are in danger. I am scared and I am sad. I\u2019m sad to see so many people showing intolerance, showing hate towards their neighbours. Every Canadian I\u2019ve talked to or who has posted on social media seems to think the same thing. The man is xenophobic, misogynist, devoid of common sense or a sense of reality; he thinks he\u2019s better than everyone, jokes about assaulting women, which we know he has; he thinks he\u2019s too smart to file his taxes. This is not someone who\u2019s fit for office. This is someone who needs help. Germany \u2018The biggest concern for Germany and all European nations is how Trump will behave towards Putin\u2019 \u2013 Rudolf, 39 If Putin senses weakness or pliability, he will take full advantage and seek to further destabilise Nato and the EU. He will finance populist movements across the EU as well as launching military operations where advantageous to Russian interests. In that case, the EU might need to look to China as its only powerful ally in favour of global stability \u2013 a really sad situation. Another big concern is that the US will tear up its climate change commitments and its rapprochement with Iran. Both would be highly disadvantageous to German and European interests in working towards global conflict reduction. The overwhelming majority of Germans are worried about the Trump presidency. Americans have pinned their hopes on a strongman-actor who isn\u2019t a politician to fix the precise same neoliberal system that produced him in the first place. That is why both Merkel and the foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, have been lukewarm in their reactions to say the least. I am saddened but not surprised after Brexit showed that neoliberal complacency has created a significant percentage of protest voters who wish to destroy the current economic order even without a coherent alternative. The US is now deeply divided into two camps: the Trump camp that is predominantly white, and the other that has a high percentage of ethnic minorities. That racial divide is deeply worrying. Portugal \u2018The mood here is one of shock and fear for the future\u2019 \u2013 William I know that nationalist parties all across Europe can\u2019t believe their luck. The middle ground has shifted to the right. I hope that moderate leaders take heed and produce a narrative, backed by policies, that is inspiring. The election, much like the Brexit result, shows how vulnerable democracies are to simple populist arguments when the circumstances are right. In both the US and the UK, the vote was decided by a tranche of voters whose lives have more despair than hope for the future. I am bitterly disappointed with both results, but the leaders on the losing side did not articulate any policies that would give the voters hope for change. They badly misread the mood of the left behinds. France and Spain \u2018In Spain they\u2019re cracking very dark jokes about the end of the world\u2019 \u2013 Beatriz In France, it is only going to encourage supporters of Marine Le Pen in the upcoming elections. In Europe, it is going to make the relationship with the US, UK and Russia that much more tense. My French friends are trying to keep business as usual and not discuss it. In Spain, they\u2019re cracking very dark jokes about the end of the world but then again, the memory in Spain is longer. Interestingly enough, regardless of their political convictions, all my acquaintances are horrified that the US has chosen such an inexperienced person and failed businessman because his endeavours have not been stable or profitable for anyone but himself. His language and his lack of control are unacceptable. I hope he does not influence other world leaders to become more like him or Putin \u2013 excessive, dominant and ultimately ineffective heads of repressive countries. I hope that he does not commit nepotism while in the office, but rather use best business practices \u2013 although that is very, very unlikely. I\u2019m preparing for the worst, because really, all the historical and economic signs point to a very, very dark time.

Kevin Trenberth, senior scientist at the US National Center for Atmospheric Research, said: \u201cThis is an unmitigated disaster for the planet.\u201d Trump has explicitly vowed to renegotiate the Paris climate deal and eliminate regulations on emissions.

Nuclear weapons: foreign hotspots could test Trump\u2019s trigger finger When Trump takes office in January, he will be given the nuclear biscuit \u2013 a card which contains the codes needed to identify himself in order to launch a nuclear attack. Many of his opponents have warned that he does not have the temperament or is too thin-skinned to be handed such a responsibility. Trump will face issues surrounding nuclear weapons in North Korea, Russia and Iran, and he himself has encouraged nuclear proliferation in places like Japan.

Trump, on the other hand, has spoken positively about Bashar al-Assad and, on numerous occasions, Vladimir Putin. Opposition leaders watched Trump\u2019s victory speech from a planning room in Sweden with dismay. Syrian opposition left with nowhere to turn after Trump\u2019s victory Silicon Valley critics cautiously open arms to Trump After spending a year rallying against Trump, Silicon Valley entrepreneurs have already changed their tone. Many organizations, such as Facebook, openly spoke out against Trump, even causing Peter Thiel, PayPal co-founder, to be outcast for his support. But Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and others who had previously criticized Trump expressed optimism.

According to close friends, he passed away on Monday and was buried in a cemetery in Montreal, Canada. A memorial is set to be held for him in Los Angeles at a later date. Tributes for the Canadian singer, who has influenced generations, poured in throughout the night including from Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau. Cohen\u2019s impact is often compared to that of Bob Dylan and Joni Mitchell, and he wrote cult classics such as Hallelujah and Suzanne. Leonard Cohen, legendary singer-songwriter, dies aged 82",

But now, I just want to wish you a very good journey. Goodbye old friend. Endless love, see you down the road.\u201d</p> <p>For much of the 1960s, he lived with Ihlen on the Greek island of Hydra, during which time he wrote numerous books of poetry, including his experimental novel Beautiful Losers, and his first album. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"56a1998a61f8c187cd4b8b83249bd589fd3eea8f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/56a1998a61f8c187cd4b8b83249bd589fd3eea8f/0_0_4950_2969/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cohen performing in Denmark in 1972.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cohen performing in Denmark in 1972.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jan Persson/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the 1970s, after his relationship with Ihlen dissolved, Cohen began a relationship with the artist Suzanne Elrod.

Cohen\u2019s second album, 1969\u2019s Songs for a Room, featured what would become one of his most popular songs, Bird on the Wire. The song has been covered by artists including Johnny Cash, Joe Cocker, Willie Nelson, kd lang and Paul Kelly. Kris Kristofferson once said that he wanted the opening lyrics from Bird on the Wire engraved on his tombstone.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmPUu-rMpWA\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BmPUu-rMpWA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>A year later, Cohen embarked upon an intense period of touring through Europe, Canada and the United States. He released his third album, Songs of Love and Hate, in 1971, which included the song Famous Blue Raincoat. The song, with its haunting depiction of the aftermath of a love triangle, was much-loved by fans, but Cohen reportedly told BBC in 1994 that he was never quite happy with the lyrics.</p> <p>Cohen\u2019s next two albums, New Skin for the Old Ceremony and Death of a Ladies\u2019 Man, marked a shift to a new sound and a dip in his popularity. The latter was also an album fuelled by controversy; at one point during recording, producer Phil Spector <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jan/19/leonard-cohen\">reportedly held a gun to Cohen\u2019s head</a> in the studio.</p> <p>In addition to giving his song Hallelujah a major boost, covers played a significant role and helped Cohen find a new audience in the late 80s, when the American artist Jennifer Warnes released a tribute album to him, effectively refashioning his image in the public eye.<br></p> <p>Cohen was born into a Jewish family, but in the 1970s he began to devote significant attention to studying Buddhism. He met and became a disciple of Joshu Sasaki Roshi, a Zen Buddhist monk. Between 1994 and 1999, Cohen lived as the monk\u2019s friend and student at the Mount Baldy Zen Center in Los Angeles.<br></p> <p>Cohen continued to record and tour in the 1980s and early 90s.

          "bodyText": "Leonard Cohen, the legendary singer-songwriter whose work inspired generations, has died at the age of 82. A post to his official Facebook page on Thursday 10 November announced the musician\u2019s passing in Los Angeles. \u201cIt is with profound sorrow we report that legendary poet, songwriter and artist, Leonard Cohen has passed away. We have lost one of music\u2019s most revered and prolific visionaries,\u201d the post said. \u201cA memorial will take place in Los Angeles at a later date. The family requests privacy during their time of grief.\u201d According to the Leonard Cohen forum, often well informed on the singer, he died on Monday 7 November and has already been buried in a private ceremony in Montreal. In a recent interview with the New Yorker, Cohen spoke about the prospect of death with calmness and clarity: \u201cI am ready to die. I hope it\u2019s not too uncomfortable. That\u2019s about it for me.\u201d Tributes poured in across social media for the Canadian musician, who had just released his 14th album, You Want It Darker, in October, to great acclaim. The Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau said the \u201cworld will miss him\u201d while , actors Rob Lowe and Russell Crowe, musicians Ben Folds, Peter Hook, Slash, Carole King, Lily Allen and Bette Midler all heaped praise on the star. Cohen, who was born in Montreal, came to prominence in the 1960s as a poet, novelist and singer-songwriter. Originally focusing on literary pursuits, he shifted his attention to music in the late 60s when he moved to New York. His first album, Songs of Leonard Cohen, was released in 1967 and became a cult hit. Cohen\u2019s influence on the music industry has been likened to that of his contemporaries Bob Dylan and Joni Mitchell and is perhaps best known for his song Hallelujah. Only a modest hit on its release in 1984, it found a much wider audience after it was covered by John Cale in 1991 and by Jeff Buckley in 1994. After the song was taken to No 1 in the UK by X-Factor winner Alexandra Burke in 2008, Cohen said: \u201cI think it\u2019s a good song, but I think too many people sing it.\u201d Despite his immense popularity, Cohen often appeared to be shy of the stage. Judy Collins, who had success with his song Suzanne, once described how she had to coax him back on stage after he left halfway through a performance. He came out of retirement in his late 70s to embark what would end up being a five-year, worldwide tour, after his former manager, Kelley Lynch, was found guilty of stealing millions of dollars from him. Cohen recently wrote a letter to his longtime muse, Marianne Ihlen, who was the subject of his songs So Long, Marianne, and Bird on a Wire, saying: \u201cYou know that I\u2019ve always loved you for your beauty and your wisdom, but I don\u2019t need to say anything more about that because you know all about that. But now, I just want to wish you a very good journey. Goodbye old friend. Endless love, see you down the road.\u201d For much of the 1960s, he lived with Ihlen on the Greek island of Hydra, during which time he wrote numerous books of poetry, including his experimental novel Beautiful Losers, and his first album. In the 1970s, after his relationship with Ihlen dissolved, Cohen began a relationship with the artist Suzanne Elrod. The couple had two children, Adam and Lorca. You Want It Darker was co-produced by Adam Cohen. Speaking recently with CBC Radio host Tom Power, he talked about working with his father on the album that many believed would be his last. \u201cThis old man, who was truly in pain and discomfort, would at some intervals get out of his medical chair and dance in front of his speakers,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd sometimes, we would put on a song and listen to it on repeat just like teenagers, with the help of medical marijuana. \u201cI think in states of pain and discomfort, what do you seek with more energy and more clarity than joy and jubilance?\u201d Adam described his father as \u201cthe last of his kind\u201d. \u201cUnlike so many from that golden era, from which he comes, he\u2019s not a nostalgia act,\u201d he said. \u201cThis guy is speaking from his particular vantage point, he\u2019s speaking about things that are meaningful to him at his particular rung in life \u2013 he will be leaving a giant void when he leaves us.\u201d You Want It Darker added to an impressive body of work. Cohen\u2019s second album, 1969\u2019s Songs for a Room, featured what would become one of his most popular songs, Bird on the Wire. The song has been covered by artists including Johnny Cash, Joe Cocker, Willie Nelson, kd lang and Paul Kelly. Kris Kristofferson once said that he wanted the opening lyrics from Bird on the Wire engraved on his tombstone. A year later, Cohen embarked upon an intense period of touring through Europe, Canada and the United States. He released his third album, Songs of Love and Hate, in 1971, which included the song Famous Blue Raincoat. The song, with its haunting depiction of the aftermath of a love triangle, was much-loved by fans, but Cohen reportedly told BBC in 1994 that he was never quite happy with the lyrics. Cohen\u2019s next two albums, New Skin for the Old Ceremony and Death of a Ladies\u2019 Man, marked a shift to a new sound and a dip in his popularity. The latter was also an album fuelled by controversy; at one point during recording, producer Phil Spector reportedly held a gun to Cohen\u2019s head in the studio. In addition to giving his song Hallelujah a major boost, covers played a significant role and helped Cohen find a new audience in the late 80s, when the American artist Jennifer Warnes released a tribute album to him, effectively refashioning his image in the public eye. Cohen was born into a Jewish family, but in the 1970s he began to devote significant attention to studying Buddhism. He met and became a disciple of Joshu Sasaki Roshi, a Zen Buddhist monk. Between 1994 and 1999, Cohen lived as the monk\u2019s friend and student at the Mount Baldy Zen Center in Los Angeles. Cohen continued to record and tour in the 1980s and early 90s. He released his album Ten New Songs in 2001, after emerging from the monastery, launching a new phase of his already decades-long career. Cohen was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2008.",

          "bodyText": "Leonard Cohen, the legendary singer-songwriter whose work inspired generations, has died at the age of 82. In a recent interview with the New Yorker, Cohen spoke about the prospect of death with calmness and clarity: \u201cI am ready to die. I hope it\u2019s not too uncomfortable. That\u2019s about it for me.\u201d Despite hints that Leonard Cohen would not live much longer his death, in a year that has already taken away Prince, David Bowie and George Martin, still came as a shock. Tributes poured in across social media for the Canadian musician, who had just released his 14th album, You Want it Darker, in October, to great acclaim. Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau said the \u201cworld will miss him\u201d while , actors Rob Lowe and Russell Crowe, musicians Ben Folds, Peter Hook, Slash, Carole King, Lily Allen and Bette Midler all heaped praise on the star. Guardian readers have been sharing their memories in the live blog comment thread.

          "bodyText": "Another giant of music has gone and his fans are in mourning. There were hints that Leonard Cohen would not live much longer, but in a year that has already taken away Prince, David Bowie and George Martin, his death \u2013 announced via a Facebook post on Thursday \u2013 still came as a shock. \u201cIt is with profound sorrow we report that legendary poet, songwriter and artist, Leonard Cohen has passed away. We have lost one of music\u2019s most revered and prolific visionaries,\u201d the post said. Twitter was soon awash in tributes from singers, writers, poets and public figures mourning the loss of a musical giant. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, sent out two tweets, first in French and then in English. \u201cNo other artist\u2019s music felt or sounded like Leonard Cohen\u2019s. Yet his work resonated across generations,\u201d Trudeau wrote. \u201cCanada and the world will miss him.\u201d Trudeau then quoted from one of Cohen\u2019s best-known songs, Hallelujah (1984), which took the artist five years to write and has been covered by hundreds of artists \u2013 including, most famously, Jeff Buckley. Musicians across all genres, from hip-hop to pop to rock, tweeted out their condolences, including Ben Folds, Peter Hook from Joy Division and New Order, KD Lang, Slash, Lily Allen and Bette Midler. \u201cAnother magical voice stilled,\u201d wrote Midler. Cohen alluded to his own death in a recent and wide-ranging interview with New Yorker editor David Remnick, in which he talked about his unfinished poems and lyrics. \u201cThe big change is the proximity to death,\u201d he says. \u201cI am a tidy kind of guy. I like to tie up the strings if I can. If I can\u2019t, that\u2019s OK. But my natural thrust is to finish things that I\u2019ve begun. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to finish those songs,\u201d he continued. \u201cMaybe, who knows? And maybe I\u2019ll get a second wind, I don\u2019t know. But I don\u2019t dare attach myself to a spiritual strategy. I don\u2019t dare do that. I\u2019ve got some work to do. Take care of business. I am ready to die. I hope it\u2019s not too uncomfortable. That\u2019s about it for me.\u201d The New Yorker has published the audio of that interview online. Some of the world\u2019s biggest artist count Cohen among their influences. He was a songwriting peer and friend of Bob Dylan, who told the New Yorker: \u201cWhen people talk about Leonard, they fail to mention his melodies, which to me, along with his lyrics, are his greatest genius ... As far as I know, no one else comes close to this in modern music.\u201d Speaking in Los Angeles this month at a Q&amp;A session for his most recent album, You Want It Darker, Cohen returned the favour, speaking of Dylan\u2019s recent Nobel Prize win: \u201cTo me, [the award] is like pinning a medal on Mount Everest for being the highest mountain.\u201d Kurt Cobain was also affected by the writing of Cohen; in Nirvana\u2019s Pennyroyal Tea, from the album In Utero, he sung: \u201cGive me Leonard Cohen afterworld, so I can sigh eternally.\u201d In an interview with MTV in 1995, the year after Cobain\u2019s suicide, Cohen revealed the band had attended a performance of his in Seattle in 1993. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t have spoken to the young man,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are always alternatives, and I might have been able to lay something on him. Or maybe not.\u201d Cohen was also a poet and author, whose 1966 novel Beautiful Losers was praised by the Boston Globe upon release: \u201cJames Joyce is not dead. He is living in Montreal under the name of Cohen.\u201d Writing for the Guardian in 2008, Alex Larman said Cohen the poet deserved as much appreciation as Cohen the songwriter. \u201cCohen would still be highly thought of if he\u2019d never written a song in his life but had stuck to writing his wry, ironic, tender verse,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAs Cohen\u2019s musical career acquired momentum, many of his collections were either compilations of earlier poems or collections of lyrics. Nevertheless, the writing elevates Cohen into that rare pantheon where a musician\u2019s lyrics are actually poetry.\u201d Cohen\u2019s first album, released in 1967, contained classic songs including Suzanne, Sisters of Mercy and So Long, Marianne, written for his muse and lover Marianne Ihlen, who died in July this year. Before she died, Cohen wrote Marianne an email, which has since gone viral. \u201cWell Marianne, it\u2019s come to this time when we are really so old and our bodies are falling apart and I think I will follow you very soon,\u201d the email read. \u201cKnow that I am so close behind you that if you stretch out your hand, I think you can reach mine ... Goodbye old friend. Endless love, see you down the road.\u201d Cohen was appointed Companion of the Order of Canada in 2002 \u2013 the country\u2019s highest honour. In a statement at the time, the governer general praised him as a \u201cCanadian icon\u201d whose \u201ccontinued popularity confirms his status as a ... venerated dean of the pop culture movement\u201d. His manager, Robert Kory, wrote in a statement: \u201cUnmatched in his creativity, insight and crippling candour, Leonard Cohen was a true visionary whose voice will be sorely missed. I was blessed to call him a friend, and for me to serve that bold artistic spirit firsthand, was a privilege and great gift. He leaves behind a legacy of work that will bring insight, inspiration and healing for generations to come.\u201d Writers too were mourning the loss, including Gary Shteyngart, who quoted from Cohen\u2019s song Everybody Knows. Lin-Manuel Miranda, the creator of hit Broadway musical Hamilton, tweeted lyrics from Suzanne. Many pointed out the auspicious timing of Cohen\u2019s death, in the same week the United States surprised many by electing Donald Trump. \u201cHe got out just in time,\u201d said podcaster and comedian Marc Maron. Canadian comedian and actor Mark Critch had a similar take: \u201cLeonard knew when to leave a party.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think this week could get any worse,\u201d wrote actor Molly Ringwald. Rob Lowe tweeted: \u201cI\u2019ve experienced the loss of many legends, but never have I seen so many works quoted in their passing.\u201d Actor Russell Crowe thanked him for \u201cthe quiet nights, the reflection, the perspective, the wry smiles and the truth\u201d, and burlesque star, model and entrepreneur Dita von Teese said he had \u201cthe most sensual male voice of all time\u201d. New Zealand artist Bic Runga, who opened for Leonard Cohen during a 2010 tour, posted a photo of her meeting \u201cone of my heroes\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m gutted,\u201d she tweeted. On 14 November 2016 the standfirst of this article was amended. A previous version incorrectly said Leonard Cohen died a day after Donald Trump\u2019s election.",

And I have been very encouraged by the I think interest in president elect Trump\u2019s wanting to work with my team around many of the issues that this great country faces and I believe that it is important for all of us regardless of party and regardless of political preferences to now come together, work together, to deal with the many challenges that we face. And in the meantime Michelle has had a chance to greet the incoming first lady and we had an excellent conversation with her as well. And we want to make sure they feel welcome as they prepare to make this transition. And most of all I want to emphasize to you, Mr President Elect, that we now are gonna want to do everything we can to help you succeed because if you succeed then the country succeeds.

On the day in September after Mike Pence spoke to some 800 folks in downtown York, Reilly scanned a panoramic picture of the crowd in the local paper and had a shock. \u201cI recognized one face,\u201d he said. That\u2019s when the party stalwart knew something was going on.</p> <p>Then, on a recent Friday, Reilly got word that the county had received 9,000 absentee-ballot applications in a single day. It had to mail them out by Monday but had no money for extra help. So Reilly turned up at the election office on Saturday to stuff the applications into envelopes himself.

          "bodyText": "Are you adjusted to the New Normal yet? President-elect Donald Trump was accorded a chilly but deferential welcome at the White House this morning as the president-elect met with President Barack Obama for a 90-minute private meeting in the Oval Office. In the first stage of a 72-day transition process between Tuesday\u2019s unexpected election victory and Trump\u2019s inauguration on 20 January, Obama said the two men discussed \u201cforeign and domestic policy\u201d and how to ensure the handover of power went smoothly. \u201cI want to emphasize to you, Mr. President-elect, that we now are going to do everything we can to help you succeed because if you succeed, then the country succeeds,\u201d Obama told his successor during a brief photo opportunity afterwards. Jihadis have welcomed Trump\u2019s surprise victory in the American presidential race, saying his election would sow greater division and expose what they described as the hatred and racism of the west towards Muslims. The endorsement of the election result by extreme Islamist figures highlighted fears that Trump\u2019s divisive rhetoric and call to ban Muslims from entering the US could empower radicals who have argued that the west seeks Islam\u2019s destruction and is at war with its adherents. Tens of thousands of Americans held further protests and acts of dissent against the election after a wave of demonstrations across the US on Wednesday night in which dozens were arrested. Protesters began mobilizing in major cities for a third day after crowds had descended on Trump buildings in New York, Chicago and Washington into the early hours to rail against the shock election result. There was a spate of claims of hate crimes in the US made on social media and to police today, in which the alleged victims said abusers had in some way cited Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the US presidential election.Social media was rife with accounts of sometimes violent incidents of hate targeted at Muslims, Latinos and African Americans. Samantha Bee blamed white people for ruining America: And the Trump transition team put forward a few key team members: Former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott told ABC Radio National that the US and UK elections and Brexit vote show that the non-politically correct don\u2019t want to tell pollsters what they really think because they would face \u201cexcoriation.\u201d President-elect Donald Trump has made his first swipe at the political media in his new role: President-elect Donald Trump reports that he had \u201cgreat chemistry\u201d with president Barack Obama: Given that Trump spent much of the mid-aughts attempting to prove that Obama was not born in the United States and was therefore constitutionally ineligible to serve as president, this is surprising. Students at Cornell University held a \u201ccry-in\u201d after the election of president-elect Donald Trump, according to the Ivy League school\u2019s student-run newspaper, where roughly 20 students met in the bleakness that is a November day in upstate New York to share tears, hugs and sorrows. \u201cI am concerned how this is validating the behavior of a lot of people,\u201d a student sipping a cup of coffee said in the Cornell Daily Sun\u2019s video, of the election. \u201cI\u2019m quite terrified, honestly,\u201d another student said. \u201cIt\u2019s saying that people are really given into fear-mongering - they\u2019re willing to put people down based on their identity just so that they would feel vindicated that they would be getting rid of \u2018Crooked Hillary.\u2019\u201d \u201cI\u2019d say the results are heartbreaking and such a slap in the face to so many of the populations that make up America,\u201d a professor said. \u201cI think it\u2019s also an indication that there and many many people who are suffering and feel that haven\u2019t been heard and they believe that Trump will answer their needs.\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s attorney told a federal judge on Thursday that he\u2019s open to settlement talks in a class-action fraud lawsuit involving the president-elect and his now-defunct Trump University. Attorney Daniel Petrocelli also asked during a hearing that the trial be delayed until early next year because Trump needs time to work on the transition to the presidency. The lawsuit alleging Trump University failed on its promise to teach success in real estate is currently set to begin 28 November in San Diego. Petrocelli said he agreed to an offer by US district court Judge Gonzalo Curiel to have US district Judge Jeffrey Miller work with both sides on a possible settlement. \u201cI can tell you right now I\u2019m all ears,\u201d Petrocelli told Curiel. Petrocelli said he planned to file a formal request for a delay by Monday. Curiel didn\u2019t say how he would rule but encouraged efforts to settle. Petrocelli said it didn\u2019t appear possible for Trump to attend the trial, and Curiel said he didn\u2019t expect attendance by the president-elect. \u201cWe\u2019re in uncharted territory. We need a little bit of time,\u201d Petrocelli said. Earlier in the day Curiel, the Indiana-born jurist who was accused of bias by Trump over his Mexican heritage, tentatively denied a request to ban statements made by and about Trump during his campaign from being used at the trial. The highly unusual petition would apply to Trump\u2019s tweets, a video of Trump making sexually predatory comments about women, his tax history, revelations about his private charitable foundation and the public criticism of the judge. Arizona senator Jeff Flake, speaking with MSNBC\u2019s Chuck Todd about the impending Trump administration, told the Meet the Press host that although he opposed Trump during the campaign, \u201cthere are a lot of things that we agree on\u201d and that Trump has, so far, been \u201cgracious\u201d to his vanquished and/or conquered opponents. \u201cI think all of us who have opposed him during the process of [have eaten] a huge helping of crow already,\u201d said the Republican senator. \u201cI didn\u2019t think that he would get this far, I really didn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cWhen there are areas of disagreement and there may be some, there will be some, we\u2019ll push back,\u201d Flake continued. \u201cBut in the meantime, there are a lot of things that we agree on. I think he\u2019s been gracious so far in terms of outreach and has done it right so far. And we\u2019ll see where we go.\u201d President-elect Donald Trump has officially won the traditionally red state of Arizona, two days after election night. Heavy Latino turnout in the Grand Canyon State, as well as young people encouraged by a ballot initiative that would have regulated marijuana like alcohol, contributed to a massive groundswell of Democratic support, but apparently not enough for defeated Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton to win the state. Former president Bill Clinton has made a quick phone call to president-elect Donald Trump, wishing the newly minted 45th president of the United States and his wife\u2019s former political rival well. \u201cDuring the brief call, President Clinton congratulated Mr. Trump and wished him well,\u201d an aide to Clinton told ABC\u2019s Liz Kreutz. Trump had long used Clinton\u2019s personal peccadilloes as ammunition against the former secretary of state. Bygones, right? Because it\u2019s 2016 and thus forbidden for a day to go past without an open letter appearing somewhere, here\u2019s another one. This time it\u2019s written by a fictional character, if that helps any: Leslie Knope, the relentlessly positive public servant from Park and Recreation, played by Amy Poehler. Upbeat, yes. Positive: not so much. I do not accept it. I acknowledge that Donald Trump is the president. I understand, intellectually, that he won the election. But I do not accept that our country has descended into the hatred-swirled slop pile that he lives in. I reject out of hand the notion that we have thrown up our hands and succumbed to racism, xenophobia, misogyny, and crypto-fascism. I do not accept that. I reject that. I fight that. Today, and tomorrow, and every day until the next election, I reject and fight that story. Several hundred protesters are taking to the streets for the second night running to protest against Trump\u2019s victory, though not yet on the scale of the thousands seen on Wednesday evening. In several places, high school and college students staged walk-out protests. At Baylor University in Texas, several dozen students have gathered: In Denver, Colorado, protesters are beginning to gather for a march scheduled to begin soon: Hundreds more gathered outside the Ohio statehouse in Columbus: And in Louisville, Kentucky: Around a thousand people have taken to the streets of Minneapolis, NBC is reporting, while students at the University of Minnesota also gathered for a protest: In Philadelphia, more than 1,000 protesters gathered in Center City for a candlelit vigil, according to the Philadelphia Enquirer. News that British prime minister Theresa May has finally had her phone call with Trump has certainly gladdened the hearts of some sections of the UK press: Peter Walker reports from London: In the call, Trump made reference to the famously close relationship between Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher as a hopeful aim for their ties, a Downing Street source said. Trump \u201calluded to their relationship as a way to underline that he was keen to have a good personal working relationship, too,\u201d the source said. A Downing Street statement added that the prime minister called \u201cto congratulate him on his hard-fought election campaign and victory\u201d, and confirmed May had been invited to visit the US \u201cas soon as possible\u201d. \u201cShe noted President-elect Trump\u2019s commitment in his acceptance speech to uniting people across America, which she said is a task we all need to focus on globally,\u201d read one section of the statement, which is as close as May has come so far to referring to Trump\u2019s controversial and divisive campaign. The call came after concerns that the much-vaunted special relationship with the US might have suffered an early setback under Trump as he spoke to nine other world leaders in the 24 hours after his election win, without May getting a call. Thanks to the magic synchronicity of Twitter, we can confirm that the vice-president-elect has spoken to the British foreign secretary, and that the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d remains \u2026 special: Edward Snowden has said he is unafraid of Russian president Vladimir Putin turning him over to the US as a favor to President-elect Donald Trump. The national security whistleblower, speaking during a webchat from Russia this afternoon, where he has been stranded since disclosing revelations of widespread National Security Agency surveillance in 2013, said it would be \u201ccrazy to dismiss\u201d the prospect of Trump striking a deal with Putin that leads to his extradition and trial. But he added: \u201cIf I was worried about safety, if the security and the future of myself was all that I cared about, I would still be in Hawaii.\u201d Snowden told the webchat hosted by the Dutch privacy-focused search engine StartPage he was comfortable with and proud of the choices he had made. \u201cI think I did the right thing,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile I can\u2019t predict what the future looks like, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen tomorrow, I can be comfortable with the way I\u2019ve lived to today.\u201d Trump, who has been complimentary about Putin and Russia in a manner that prompted accusations from his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton that he was a \u201cpuppet\u201d, has in the past mused about having Snowden killed. Trump\u2019s major national security ally, the retired general and former Defense Intelligence Agency chief Michael Flynn, oversaw a highly speculative DIA report that claimed Snowden took from the NSA a larger trove of documents than ever confirmed based on what Snowden could access as a contract systems administrator. \u201cSnowden is a spy who has caused great damage in the US. A spy in the old days, when our country was respected and strong, would be executed,\u201d Trump tweeted in 2014. All of that has prompted concern among Snowden\u2019s supporters worldwide that the groundwork for an extradition is in place. But Snowden proclaimed himself unperturbed. The first sighting of former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton after her concession to president-elect Donald Trump yesterday afternoon: Dan Roberts takes a look a policies that could be implemented under President-elect Donald Trump. Another White House transition-team pool report: Hope Hicks has not responded to any additional emails with questions about the president-elect\u2019s status, schedule or whereabouts since changing course and saying he was headed back to New York. If there is any other information that comes in, I will send it immediately, but otherwise I won\u2019t have any further pool reports today. Thanks to you all for bearing with my failed attempts to get more out of the transition today. Little on-the-nose, don\u2019t you think? Former Vermont governor and onetime presidential candidate Howard Dean has announced via Twitter that he is running to reclaim his old position as chair of the Democratic National Committee. Dean, who served as chair from 2005 to 2009, is running to replace interim chair Donna Brazile, who has served since July when Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz resigned in the wake of a Russian-sponsored hack of DNC servers that revealed high-level antipathy towards then-presidential candidate Bernie Sanders among the DNC\u2019s leadership. Video: President-elect Donald Trump appeared before the press to answer several questions this afternoon during a visit to Capitol Hill, and said that his first priorities once he is inaugurated will be controlling immigration, reforming healthcare and creating \u201cbig league jobs.\u201d (Or, possibly, \u201cbigly jobs.\u201d We\u2019ve never been totally sure!) Trump was in Washington to meet President Obama and also held discussions with key Republican figures including Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell. The president-elect\u2019s staff has provided no information, despite being asked, about his schedule or activities since leaving Capitol Hill. This is the most incredible political feat I have seen in my lifetime. Donald Trump heard a voice out in this country that no one else heard ... he connected in ways with people no one else did. President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s transition team has announced that former Ohio secretary of state Ken Blackwell will be in charge of handling domestic policy issues in relation to the upcoming Trump administration\u2019s legislative and executive priorities in its first hundred days Blackwell, who currently works as a senior fellow at the Family Research Council, a Christian lobbying organization that lobbies lawmakers against LGBT rights, abortion and pornography, first gained national attention in 2006, when he was running to serve as Ohio\u2019s governor. In an interview at the time, Blackwell declared that homosexuality was a \u201clifestyle\u201d that \u201ccan be changed. \u201cI think homosexuality is a lifestyle, it\u2019s a choice, and that lifestyle can be changed,\u201d Blackwell told the Columbus Dispatch at the time. \u201cI think it is a transgression against God\u2019s law, God\u2019s will.\u201d \u201cThe reality is, again,\u201d Blackwell continued, \u201cthat I think we make choices all the time. And I think you make good choices and bad choices in terms of lifestyle. Our expectation is that one\u2019s genetic makeup might make one more inclined to be an arsonist or might make one more inclined to be a kleptomaniac. Do I think that they can be changed? Yes.\u201d Trump himself has said that, while he does not support same-sex marriage rights, he does support LGBT rights. Vice president-elect Mike Pence, on the other hand, first emerged on the national stage after signing an expansive anti-LGBT measure into law, and once signed into law a bill that would send same-sex couples attempting to obtain marriage licenses to jail. From the president-elect\u2019s pool report: Hope Hicks sends the following update about the president-elect\u2019s plans for tonight: \u2018Now heading to NYC\u2019 That is the full extent of what she has told me. She is not responding to questions about his schedule for the rest of the day The \u201cdishonest press\u201d is getting its comeuppance from the new administration, it seems. President Barack Obama should urgently seek to impose constitutional checks on the US president\u2019s access to \u201cthe most awesome assassination machine ever known to man\u201d, a former state department official in the Obama administration said today. Jeremy Shapiro disclosed the Obama team before the 2012 elections had considered imposing such constitutional checks on the US president\u2019s ability to order killings fearing Obama was about to lose the presidential elections to the Republicans. Speaking in London, Shapiro, a former special adviser an assistant secretary in the State Department, disclosed the Obama team in the State Department \u201cin the run-up to the 2012 election the Obama thought might lose and there was some thinking - \u2018Gee, we have created the most awesome assassination machine ever known to man whereby we can, with very little oversight, basically kill anyone in the world outside of America.\u2019\u201d He added the Obama officials thought \u201cWe are using that responsibly because we are good people,\u201d but it was not institutionalized. \u201cWhen people looked at it they thought, \u2018Christ this is scary, what if we give this to the Republicans?\u2019\u201d He said the Obama team \u201cstarted to have a process to institutionalize the process, but it did not get very institutionalized.\u201d Leslie Vinjamuri, senior lecturer at SOAS, added Obama should put all his remaining energy in his final weeks in the Oval Office to \u201cdo anything he can to to regulate, to create norms, institutionalize, create blocking mechanisms.\u201d The academics were discussing Trump\u2019s approach to foreign policy and the degree he will delegate or take personal charge. Shapiro warned: \u201cin the last 15 years, power in foreign policy has centralized to an enormous extent within the presidency and Congress, and most of the institutions in foreign policy has become enormously supine in the face of what ever the [resident wants to do does in foreign policy. We have essentially by default almost given this to the president.\u201d Cora Currier writes for the Guardian: Audre Lorde once wrote that \u201cpoetry is not a luxury\u201d, and right now it is a necessity. What kind of poetry can get us through a Donald Trump presidency? We\u2019ll need satire and spitting vitriol. We\u2019ll need rallying cries. We\u2019ll need reminders of human dignity. Each poet here has struggled with the relationship between poetry and action, with the question of poetry\u2019s relevance in a time of crisis. Adrienne Rich said: \u201cA poem can\u2019t free us from the struggle for existence, but it can uncover desires and appetites buried under the accumulating emergencies of life.\u201d These are words carefully chosen not for solace but for strength, poems that dip into the reservoirs of literature to find fuel for the day ahead. They are, to borrow from WH Auden\u2019s famous poem September 1, 1939, \u201cironic points of light\u201d that \u201cflash out wherever the Just / exchange their messages\u201d. Poems that serve as signals through the ages that good exists, and that someone is awake and listening.

Trump owned 92 percent of Trump University and had control over all major decisions, the students\u2019 court papers say. The president-elect denies the allegations and has argued that he relied on others to manage the business. Trial is scheduled to begin Nov. 28. In the ruling on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel in San Diego said Trump\u2019s lawyers can renew objections to specific campaign statements and evidence during trial. Trump\u2019s attorneys had argued that jurors should not hear about statements Trump made during the campaign, including about Curiel himself. Trump attacked the judge as biased against him. He claimed Curiel, who was born in Indiana but is of Mexican descent, could not be impartial because of Trump\u2019s pledge to build a wall between the United States and Mexico. Read the full piece here. Here\u2019s footage of the impromptu press conference, via the Huffington Post: Asked about his priorities, Trump mentions immigration, the border, health care and jobs, \u201cbig league jobs.\u201d Ohio governor John Kasich is praying for the success of Trump, whom he has come very close to openly despising. Trump has emerged from the meeting and started an impromptu gaggle with reporters that ended when he was asked about his plan to ban Muslims, CNN reports: Trump is still meeting with McConnell, the press pool reports: The President-elect is still in his meeting with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, which an aide said should last up to an hour. The two walked by earlier, but have remained inside since. The Vice President-elect has already left the Capitol. Here\u2019s a transcription via the Trump press pool of Trump\u2019s meeting with speaker Paul Ryan: Ryan repeatedly chided reporters for shouting questions --- including how the \u201cwall is going to be paid for.\u201d Ryan: Donald Trump had one of the most impressive victories we have ever seen and we\u2019re going to turn that victory into progress for the American people, and we are now talking about how we are going to hit the ground running to get this country turned around and make America great again.\u201d Trump: Speaker Ryan, thank you very much. We had a meeting, I met with president before, as you know. I think we are going to absolutely spectacular things for the American people and I look forward to starting --- quite frankly we can\u2019t get started fast enough.\u201d [Inaudible] \u201c\u2026 Whether it\u2019s on healthcare or immigration so many different things. We\u2019re going to lower taxes, so many different things we are going to be working on.\u201d \u201cWe had a very detailed meeting, and we\u2019re going to lower taxes, as you know, health care we\u2019re going to make it affordable. We are going to do a real job on healthcare [inaudible]. As he wrapped up, Trump said he had a \u201cgreat meeting\u201d with Ryan and then the Speaker led him out onto his balcony. The Obamas\u2019 dogs got one whiff of Trump and ambled elsewhere. Trump will stay in DC for the night, spokeswoman Hope Hicks has informed the media pool. But no word on whether he\u2019ll stay at his new hotel on Pennsylvania avenue. Endorse. From the piece: And she [the heavy-construction worker] shared an anecdote that reflected how differently Trump\u2019s comments had been received in some places than others. \u201cI\u2019m setting steel for this new gas plant\u2026I\u2019m operating a rough terrain forklift,\u201d she wrote. \u201cSo today, I kept thinking about the debate and the audio was released \u2026 And I got underneath a load of steel and was moving it\u2026I was laughing and laughing and one of the iron workers asked \u2018what are u laughing at.\u2019 I said \u2018I grabbed that load right by the pussy\u2019 and laughed some more\u2026And said \u2018when you\u2019re an operator you can do that ya know\u2019, laughed all fucking day.\u201d Just last week, I was back in Ohio, in the southeastern Appalachian corner. I was at a graduation ceremony for opiate addicts who had gone through a recovery program, and sitting with four women, all around 30, who were still in the program. Someone mentioned the election, and all four of them piped up that they were voting for the first time ever. For whom? I asked. They looked at me as if I had asked the dumbest question in the world. All four were for Trump. The most of the loquacious of the group, Tiffany Chesser, said she was voting for him because her boyfriend worked at a General Electric light-bulb plant nearby that was seeing more of its production lines being moved to Mexico. She saw voting for Trump as a straightforward transaction to save his job. \u201cIf he loses that job we\u2019re screwed \u2014 I\u2019ll lose my house,\u201d she said. \u201cThere used to be a full parking lot there \u2014 now you go by, there are just three trucks in the lot.\u201d Look who else is visiting the White House today! John Kasich, the Ohio governor who never gave Trump the time of day and voted for John McCain for president and whose state was then won by Trump by almost 9 points. That\u2019s Kasich there at left. Oh yes and also that\u2019s the NBA champion Cleveland Cavaliers. LeBron James, who campaigned a lot for Clinton, is in the White House today. What he said. Obamacare enrollments (or preliminary signups? it\u2019s not clear) spiked after the election, the secretary of health and human services reports: Now Trump and Pence and Melania Trump are meeting with senate majority leader Mitch McConnell on Capitol Hill. McConnell said yesterday he expected to work with Trump on filling the supreme court vacancy, on tax reform, on Obamacare and more. Developing... There\u2019s the Martin Luther King Jr bust Barack Obama moved into the Oval Office upon becoming president. Obama was criticized for moving a bust of Winston Churchill outside the Oval to make room for MLK. There are \u201conly so many tables where you can put busts, otherwise it starts looking a little cluttered,\u201d Obama said. Anyone think the MLK Jr bust will stay there after January? Paul Ryan can see Donald Trump\u2019s hotel from his house the Capitol balcony. That\u2019s vice-president-elect Mike Pence and Melania Trump with them of course. Some initial footage, and the requisite \u201cthis meeting was wonderful\u201d quote from Ryan. Developing... Josh Earnest describes the Michelle Obama - Melania Trump meeting. They had tea, admired a balcony view and talked about raising kids in the White House. How different than what would have come to pass had Clinton won. Earnest: The first lady hosted Mrs Trump in the private residence... for some tea and a tour... part of that tour included stepping out onto the Truman balcony... you\u2019ve heard the president and Mrs Obama describe the quality of time that they\u2019ve spent on the Truman balcony.... there was also an opportunity for the two women to walk through the state floor of the White House... They also had a discussion about raising kids at the White House. The first lady\u2019s two daughters spent their formative years here at the White House... After their tour concluded, the first lady and Mrs Trump walked over to the Oval Office and the two couples had a chance to speak. Obama on Monday called Trump \u201ctemperamentally unfit\u201d and \u201cuniquely unqualified.\u201d \u201cThe president\u2019s views haven\u2019t changed,\u201d the press secretary says. But it\u2019s time for a successful transition. \u201cThe president\u2019s plan to take a long vacation after he leaves office have not changed.\u201d \u2013 Josh Earnest Obama appreciated how George W Bush gave him space after Obama took office, giving him \u201csome running room,\u201d Earnest says. \u201cPresident Obama admired that.\u201d He doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s kidding: After dismissing the question multiple times, Earnest allows that yes, Obama may continue to think that Trump is unqualified to be president: Further to our earlier post about hate incidents since the election, the Guardians\u2019 Luis Echegaray flags a disturbing incident at Elon University in North Carolina: Here\u2019s a further collection of such incidents: Earnest is asked about the anti-Trump protests across the country on Wednesday evening. Reply: We\u2019ve got a carefully, constitutionally protected right to free speech... it is a right that should be exercised without violence. There are people disappointed in the outcome... but it\u2019s important for us to remember that we\u2019re Democrats and Republicans but we\u2019re Americans and patriots first. Read further: Earnest is asked whether Obama still considers Trump unfit to be president. Reply: The two men did not re-litigate their differences in the Oval Office. We\u2019re on to the next phase now. Via the house speaker\u2019s spokesperson: The President-elect, Mrs. Trump, Vice President-elect, and the Speaker are having lunch and discussing the transition. The Speaker has also invited President-elect Trump to the Capitol after their meeting to show him where he\u2019ll be sworn in on Inauguration Day. Press secretary Josh Earnest is talking about the big meeting. He says he met Jared Kushner and Hope Hicks. \u201cI had the opportunity to meet with her briefly \u2013 to meet her, I should say.\u201d On the Obama-Trump meeting, Earnest has this to say: The meeting might have been a little less awkward than some might have expected. Trump referred in the Oval to some \u201chigh-flying assets\u201d the president had told him about, a reporter notes. What the heck was that about? Earnest refers the question to team Trump. Here\u2019s some added color from inside the Oval office, via the Trump media pool, which Trump ditched again upon leaving the White House for his meeting with Paul Ryan: The president kept saying, \u201ctell me when you\u2019re ready\u201d to reporters, as he waited to make a statement. The president-elect looked around the room, and at the floor, his hands tented below him. The only senior aide in the room spotted in the room from the White House was press secretary Josh Earnest. Trump aides Hope Hicks and Jared Kushner, who had been waiting in the Cabinet room until the meeting concluded, were in place as well. Kushner took iPhone photos as they spoke. Obama looked straight at Trump for the full statement, his hands clasped. He nodded at the end. Both men ignored shouted questions, including \u201cMr. President, do you still think he is a threat to the republic?\u201d Obama explained to Trump with a joke that the reporters always ask questions and they need to be shooed out, as he motioned with his hand. He singled out one aide who was wrangling the press, saying, \u201cshe\u2019s small, but she\u2019s tough.\u201d Trump said \u201cshe\u2019s doing a very good job.\u201d Barack Obama: I just had the opportunity to have an excellent conversation with President-elect Trump. It was wide-ranging. We talked about some of the organizational issues in setting up the White House. We talked about foreign policy, we talked about domestic policy. And as I said last night, my number one priority in the coming two months is to try to facilitate a transition that ensures our president elect is successful. And I have been very encouraged by the I think interest in president elect Trump\u2019s wanting to work with my team around many of the issues that this great country faces and I believe that it is important for all of us regardless of party and regardless of political preferences to now come together, work together, to deal with the many challenges that we face. And in the meantime Michelle has had a chance to greet the incoming first lady and we had an excellent conversation with her as well. And we want to make sure they feel welcome as they prepare to make this transition. And most of all I want to emphasize to you, Mr President Elect, that we now are gonna want to do everything we can to help you succeed because if you succeed then the country succeeds. Please [indicates Trump should speak]. Donald Trump: Well, thank you very much President Obama. This was a meeting that was going to last for maybe 10 or 15 minutes and we were just going to get to know each other. We had never met each other. I have great respect- the meeting lasted for almost an hour and a half, and it could have, as far as I\u2019m concerned, it could have gone on for a lot longer. We really, we discussed a lot of different situations, some wonderful and some difficulties. I very much look forward to dealing with the president in the future, including counsel. He\u2019s explained some of the difficulties, some of the high flying assets and some of the really great things that have been achieved. So Mr President, it was a great honor being with you and I look forward to being with you many, many more times in the future. Obama: Thank you everybody \u2013 we are not going to be taking any questions. [To Trump:] Always a good rule: don\u2019t answer any questions when they just start yelling. Here\u2019s a video of Obama and Trump\u2019s full remarks following their Oval Office meeting: Remember Aaron Schock, the former Illinois congressman whose sketchy use of his congressional allowance and campaign funds was exposed after a reporter spoke with the interior decorator of his office who said she\u2019d been inspired by Downton Abbey? He\u2019s been indicted. Now to hatch plans with his Republican colleagues for next steps. Trump is in a motorcade en route to meet with House speaker Paul Ryan at the Capitol Hill Club and majority leader Mitch McConnell at Capitol Hill. Here\u2019s a media pool transcription of president Obama\u2019s remarks: We talked about some of organizational issues in setting up the White House. We talked about foreign policy. We talked about domestic policy. As I sat last night, my number one in the next coming two months is to try to facilitate a transition that ensures our President-elect is successful and I have been very encouraged by the interest by the President-elect Trump\u2019s wanting to work with my team around many of the issues that this great country faces. I believe that it is important for all regardless of party and regardless of political preferences to now come together, work together to deal with the many challenges we face. More video and photos of the meeting: An amicable \u2013 if a bit stiff, and did we notice strained on the president\u2019s part? \u2013 appearance before the cameras for the two men. Obama says \u201cI have been very encouraged by an interest in president-elect Trump\u2019s wanting to work with my team around many of the issues that the country faces... it is important for all of us ... to now come together, work together... Michelle\u2019s had the chance to greet the incoming first lady, and we\u2019ve had an excellent conversation and want to make sure they feel welcome... We now are gonna want to do everything we can because if you succeed the country succeeds. Trump: We had never met.. The meeting was supposed to last 10 minutes... I have great respect... it went on for an hour-and-a-half and as far as I\u2019m concerned it could have gone on longer... we really we discussed a lot of different situations, some wonderful and some difficulties. I very much look forward to dealing with the president in the future, including counsel. Mr president, was a great honor being with you and I look forward to being with you many many more times in the future. According to reports and photos shown to me by a friend in the room, a grinning Trump patted Obama on the back as they got up to leave, though there was only one handshake between the two men in front of the brief photo opportunity. You don\u2019t see that expression on Obama\u2019s face often. Obama said the number one priority was to ensure a smooth transition, so Trump could be a successful president. \u201cIf he succeeds, the country succeeds,\u201d Obama said. Trump said he had \u201crespect for the president\u201d and said they talked about some wonderful things and some difficult things. Asked if he would seek the advice of the president, Trump said Obama was a \u201cvery fine man.\u201d Trump also boasted of how long their meeting had been. He said it was scheduled for ten minutes but lasted for an hour and a half, and could have gone on much longer. Obama and Trump talked about foreign and domestic policy according to initial pool chatter in the press room. More to come.... In short remarks, the president said the two had an \u201cexcellent conversation.\u201d The Obamas canceled a photo-op of the current and future first couples outside the south entrance of the White House, the Wall Street Journal reports. But we\u2019re about to get photos from inside the Oval office. The media pool is going into the Oval Office now. That suggests a 90-minute meeting. POTUS and PEOTUS were seated in the high-backed armchairs at the end of the room, as is typical for when the President speaks to world leaders. Both men spoke briefly. Remarks to come... At least we\u2019ll have access to the vice president? That\u2019s pretty important, right? Still meeting. President Barack Obama and president-elect Donald Trump have been meeting for about 90 minutes now. What are they talking about do you think? Is Obama lecturing Trump about keeping a cool head? Is Trump lecturing Obama about leadership? Are they comparing notes on what it feels like to give electrifying speeches to thousands of people across the country? Is Obama telling Trump about how much his hate speech wounds individual Americans and the country and world at large? Is he lecturing Trump on the constitution? Is Trump asking to \u201ctry out that chair\u201d? Are they talking about family, about Vladimir Putin, about government surveillance, about filling the role of mourner-in-chief after mass shootings, about protocol, about climate change? Trump\u2019s traveling press pool continues to track Kushner and McDonough. Kushner, the scion of a New Jersey real estate empire that dwarfs Trump\u2019s, was a key adviser to his father-in-law throughout the campaign. It\u2019s unclear what role he would have in the White House. The pool report: McDonough and Kushner walked back from the lawn and across the Rose Garden at 12:07. McDonough led him up the colonnade, followed by the same group of aides who\u2019d left them on their own for the walk. They entered the White House, looked up briefly when a reporter called out \u201cDenis!\u201d but did not respond. Trump and Obama are still meeting. What are they talking about? Obamacare? Here\u2019s a photo of Jared Kushner and White House chief of staff Denis McDonough: Following his meeting with Obama today, president-elect Trump will meet with House speaker Paul Ryan at the Capitol Hill Club and majority leader Mitch McConnell at Capitol Hill. Trump has been hard on Ryan, attacking him repeatedly during the campaign as a weak leader. Ryan canceled a plan campaign appearance with Trump after the emergence of hot-mic video in which Trump described grabbing women\u2019s genitals without their consent. Members of Trump\u2019s staff including campaign chairman Stephen Bannon have called for Ryan\u2019s head and it\u2019s possible the president-elect will seek to torpedo Ryan\u2019s reelection as House speaker. But on Wednesday, Ryan put a good face on the relationship, saying he had spoken with Trump twice and was eager to work with him and calling Trump\u2019s election good for the country. McConnell voiced a similar view. Three Republican men in control of the legislative and executive branches. Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway has been offered a White House job, she tweets. Conway is the first woman ever to have run a successful presidential campaign. (Donna Brazile was Al Gore\u2019s campaign manager in 2000; he lost?) What are they doing in there? Dan Roberts reports from the White House: The press pool still has not gone into the Oval Office, which suggests the meeting is going on longer than some of us expected. From the media pool assigned to Trump which Trump has ditched, a sighting of Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner with White House chief of staff Denis McDonough. White House chief of staff Denis McDonough was just spotted leading Jared Kushner and other Trump aides, including Dan Scavino, across the back edge of the Rose Garden. McDonough led Kushner on a walk down the South Lawn as the others dispersed. Reminds us of the time in 2006 that Kushner and Peter Kaplan went to that Yankees game. Seemed high-stakes at the time; Kushner had just purchased the New York Observer, where Kaplan was editor, which nobody wanted to see fail. Kaplan died of cancer in 2013. Kushner\u2019s now getting the keys to the White House. Here\u2019s an interesting phenomenon. Trump supporters coming out of the woodwork post-election. Maybe the sign instead of being an expression of support for Trump in particular is a general expression of patriotic hope for a steady future for the country? Hm. But wouldn\u2019t an American flag work better in that case? (h/t @loisbeckett) The press pool is going in now, in the first sign that the Obama-Trump meeting is coming close to an end. The pool includes members of the separate press pool which has been covering Trump but has been barred for being with him since the election. The press pool has just been informed that in 10 minutes they will be going back to prepare for a \u201cspray\u201d. What will happen is they will stand in a West Wing corridor, for what I guess will be 15-20 minutes, while they wait for the private Obama-Trump meeting to finish. Then they will be ushered inside the Oval Office to take pictures of Trump and Obama and record what we expect to be brief remarks from each. It is possible, though unlikely, that Trump may come out to another \u201cstake-out\u201d location outside the front of the West Wing afterwards to make separate remarks to the wider press corps. More likely he will depart, as he arrived, out of public sight. A spokesperson for British prime minister Theresa May releases this description of a conversation between May and Trump: The Prime Minister spoke to US President-elect Donald Trump earlier today to congratulate him on his hard-fought election campaign and victory. The President-elect said he very much looked forward to working with the Prime Minister and congratulated her on her recent appointment. The Prime Minister and President-elect Trump agreed that the US-UK relationship was very important and very special, and that building on this would be a priority for them both. President-elect Trump set out his close and personal connections with, and warmth for, the UK. He said he was confident that the special relationship would go from strength to strength. Trump\u2019s staff has not released a description of the call. That\u2019s unusual. Presidents typically release their own versions of such communications so they can frame the conversation their way instead of conceding to the foreign government\u2019s framing. Trump\u2019s staff is not informing the media of top-level \u2013 official now, aren\u2019t they? \u2013 conversations Trump is having with foreign leaders, among who knows what other conversations. He\u2019s here, reports Guardian Washington bureau chief Dan Roberts from the White House: Police are investigating the burning of a gay pride flag outside a home in Rochester, NY, as a potential hate crime, TWC news reports: Ventura said he connects this incident and another flag burning in the same neighborhood to the election. To help deal with what had happened, he joined dozens of others Wednesday night at the Gay Alliance LGBTQ Resource Center, where many were also feeling distressed about the election outcome. Reports of racist attacks and other hate-crime behavior have surfaced again and again since the election. Here\u2019s one against Muslim-Americans in San Diego Wednesday and here is one against a Mexican restaurant in Boston. As Trump meets Obama, Michelle Obama is to take Melania Trump on a tour of the White House and the east wing where the family lives. This afternoon, vice president Joe Biden is to meet with vice-president-elect Mike Pence, a longtime legislator relatively well-known in Washington. There is not expected to be any live coverage of the Trump Obama meeting, but here is a live stream that may capture Trump\u2019s arrival: Trump ditched his press pool this morning, in continuance of his late-campaign practice. Spokeswoman Hope Hicks told Trump\u2019s pool that the White House would provide pool coverage of today\u2019s meeting. The White House press pool of course is at the White House, not with Trump. So that doesn\u2019t make any sense. The protective press pool attached to the president, when it works, increases the access of the public to the presidency and the White House. The press pool describes the daily movements of the president and remarks variations in those, introduces the public to the people and conversations in the president\u2019s orbit, and provides coverage in case of unforeseen events extending to an emergency. Insofar as the media is a tool for the public to pry open and look inside the government \u2013 and we are keenly aware that a lot of people these days think \u201cinsofar\u201d is \u201cnot very far\u201d \u2013 the press pool is a tool for the larger media to keep an eye on the president. Trump\u2019s ditching it, for now. Take him to our leader. The Canadian government has said it is open to renegotiating Nafta \u2013 the North American free-trade agreement, routinely described by Donald Trump on the campaign trail as the \u201cworst deal in history\u201d \u2013 in a move that extends an olive branch to the incoming US administration. [Trump also described the Iran nuclear deal and the Trans-Pacific partnership as the worst deals in history.] The Guardian\u2019s Ashifa Kassam reports from Toronto: David MacNaughton, Canada\u2019s ambassador to Washington, said on Wednesday the federal government was prepared to revisit the 1994 pact. \u201cI think any agreement can be improved on,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cIf they want to have a discussion about improving Nafta, then we are ready to come to the table to try to put before the new administration anything that will benefit both Canada and the United States and obviously Mexico also,\u201d said MacNaughton. \u201cSo we are prepared to talk.\u201d Throughout the American election campaign, Trump vowed to renegotiate Nafta in order to secure a better deal for American workers. If this proved impossible, Trump said he would withdraw the US from the agreement. Doing so could wreak havoc on the Canadian economy, which in 2015 sent 77% of its exports to the United States. MacNaughton declined to offer details on what Canada would seek from the negotiations, save for noting that free trade on lumber, which has long ranked as an irritant between the two countries, would be among Canada\u2019s demands. His remarks came hours before Justin Trudeau, Canada\u2019s prime minister, spoke to Trump to congratulate him on his win and invite him to visit Canada. The president-elect is on the ground in Washington. No protesters yet at the White House in anticipation of Trump\u2019s visit. Amnesty International is launching a billboard in Times Square today asking people to to post selfies in support of refugees. The billboard, by Amnesty International and media platform The Drum, hopes to challenge racism and xenophobia around refugees. The relevance of the billboard launching the same week that Donald Trump, who promises to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants and tighten screening around Syrian refugees, didn\u2019t go unnoticed. From the press release: Drum founder Gordon Young, who will be in Times Square to celebrate the billboard going live, today offered an open invitation to Donald Trump to attend the unveiling and show his support, \u201cCongratulations to President-Elect Donald Trump. Now that he has succeeded, it is time to demonstrate how the responsibility of office can change campaigning rhetoric into real leadership. We invite him to extend an olive branch to refugees - Mexican or other\u201d Every media organization is publishing its version of \u201chow Trump won,\u201d and this snippet from Time magazine is particularly interesting, looking at Trump voters in Pennsylvania: Chris Reilly, a commissioner in York County, Pennsylvania, has lived in the heavily Republican area north of Baltimore for 28 years. On the day in September after Mike Pence spoke to some 800 folks in downtown York, Reilly scanned a panoramic picture of the crowd in the local paper and had a shock. \u201cI recognized one face,\u201d he said. That\u2019s when the party stalwart knew something was going on. Then, on a recent Friday, Reilly got word that the county had received 9,000 absentee-ballot applications in a single day. It had to mail them out by Monday but had no money for extra help. So Reilly turned up at the election office on Saturday to stuff the applications into envelopes himself. As he did, he noticed something surprising. The applications were running 10 to 1 male. And when he peeked at the employment lines, he saw a pattern. \u201cDockworker. Forklift operator. Roofer,\u201d Reilly recalled. \u201cGrouter. Warehouse stocker. These people had probably never voted before. They were coming out of nowhere.\u201d Hillary Clinton is still leading in the popular vote, with 59,923,033 votes (47.7%) to Donald Trump\u2019s 59,692,978. That\u2019s a pretty evenly split country, with just over 230,000 votes. The Federal Aviation Authority has listed Trump Tower in Midtown, home of Donald Trump, wife Melania and son Barron, in the no-fly zone. The FAA had placed \u201ctemporary flight restrictions for VIP Movement\u201d on the area for election night but has now extended it indefinitely after Trump\u2019s win. The area of Trump Tower is now, as New York magazine pointed out, a national-security site: The agency issued an administrative directive called a \u201cNotice to Airmen\u201d banning pilots from flying within two nautical miles of the geographical point located at 40\u00ba45\u201954\u201d north, 73\u00ba58\u201925\u201d west \u2014 that being the southeastern corner of Central Park, four blocks north of Trump Tower. As we prepare for President Obama to welcome President-elect Trump to the White House, let\u2019s just enjoy this photo doing the rounds of social media of Obama\u2019s staff listening to their boss make a gracious speech about Trump\u2019s win. So perhaps Rudy Guiliani, former NYC mayor and one of Trump\u2019s most ardent surrogates, won\u2019t be Attorney General in the Trump administration. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie\u2019s name is also being thrown around as possible AG contender. From the Guardian\u2019s Moscow correspondent... Russia\u2019s deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov has said Moscow\u2019s emissaries were in touch with people around the Trump campaign during the election process, despite repeated denials from the Trump campaign that such links existed. Ryabkov told Interfax they\u2019ve reached out to Trump since his election win. \u201cWe are doing this and we have been doing so during the election campaign. Obviously, we know most of the people from his entourage. Those people have always been in the limelight in the United States and have occupied high-ranking positions,\u201d he said. \u201cI cannot say that all of them but quite a few have been staying in touch with Russian representatives. We have just begun to consider ways of building dialogue with the future Donald Trump administration and channels we will be using for those purposes,\u201d Ryabkov said. Foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova confirmed to Bloomberg that Russian embassy staff met with Trump associates during the campaign, and said people around the Clinton campaign had rejected such contacts. It is not particularly surprising that Russian representatives would have made overtures to Trump during the campaign; it is standard practice in all election campaigns. It is interesting that Ryabkov has chosen to say this publicly, however, given the role alleged Russian interference played in the campaign and given Trump\u2019s campaign publicly denied such contacts. Vice-president Joe Biden will meet with VP-elect Mike Pence at the White House at 2.45pm today. Thousands of Americans took to the streets in protest of the election of Donald Trump last night, chanting \u201cnot my president\u201d and shutting down roadways. Cities including Los Angeles, New York, Washington DC and Philadelphia all saw large protest turnout. Reporters Sam Levin in San Francisco, Zach Stafford in Chicago and Scott Bixby in New York covered last night\u2019s protests. As night fell in midtown Manhattan, people took over Sixth Avenue and marched by Trump Tower, carrying signs that read \u201cNot my president\u201d, \u201cShe got more votes\u201d and \u201cHands off my pussy\u201d, a reference to a leaked recording where Trump bragged that he could sexually assault women because of his fame. A number of arrests were made. Protesters who had marched all the way from Union Square \u2013 some 35 blocks downtown \u2013 continued past Trump Tower, with a crowd congregating in front of the president-elect\u2019s building. \u201cFuck your tower! Fuck your wall!\u201d people chanted at Trump Tower\u2019s brass-escutcheoned facade, as scores of NYPD officers manned barricades, behind which stood eight department of sanitation trucks filled with dirt.

Former US secretary of state Madeleine Albright has warned Trump against American isolationism, telling him the US must play its part in the Nato alliance. \u201cNato is obviously key. We are responsible for each other, a two-way street,\u201d Albright told the Guardian in an interview on Wednesday. Trump alarmed many in July when, at the Republican national convention where he accepted his party\u2019s nomination, he implied that the US might not protect other members of Nato if they were not contributing enough to the military costs, and hinted he could withdraw US forces from around the world. A cornerstone of Nato\u2019s strength, and global security, is the pact that an attack on one member is an attack on all. \u201cThe US must be involved abroad. If we are not engaged, then the system doesn\u2019t work at all, or, even, a new system cannot be created,\u201d she said. Many Ukrainians feel they were let down in the level of support they received from the west for fighting Russia-backed separatists in the east of the country, but a Donald Trump presidency brings a whole new level of fear, writes Shaun Walker. What really terrifies Kiev is the fact that Trump has hinted he could be amenable to the sort of Great Power politics that Putin enjoys: man-to-man summitry where geopolitical deals are struck. G Given the importance of Ukraine to Putin\u2019s plans, he would be likely to demand the country is recognised as one where Russia has \u201cspecial interests\u201d. In Putin\u2019s dream world and Kiev\u2019s nightmare, the recognition of annexed Crimea as part of Russia could even be up for discussion. A somewhat nervous statement was issued by Ukrainian president Poroshenko, congratulating Trump and noting he had been assured by the US ambassador that the incoming Trump administration \u201cwould remain a reliable partner in the struggle for democracy\u201d. In reality, nobody knows what Trump\u2019s position on Russia and Ukraine will be, including the US ambassador. As on so many policy positions, Trump has made contradictory statements, at times suggesting more should have been done to support Ukraine against Russia while at other times suggesting Crimea should be part of Russia. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has called for clarity from on issues in which Trump\u2019s campaign remarks have rattled Europe, including s global trade, climate policy and future relations with Nato. \u201cWe would like to know how things will proceed with global trade policy,\u201d Juncker said at a business event in Berlin, according to Reuters. \u201cWe would like to know what intentions he has regarding the (Nato) alliance. We must know what climate policies he intends to pursue. This must be cleared up in the next few months.\u201d Juncker said he did not expect the trade deal between the United States and the European Union, currently being negotiated, to be finalised this year as previously planned. \u201cThe trade deal with the United States, I do not view that as something that would happen in the next two years,\u201d he said. A Russian diplomat says Moscow had contacts with the Trump campaign ahead of the election, AP reports. Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov was quoted as telling the Interfax news agency that \u201cthere were contacts\u201d with influential people in Trump\u2019s circle. \u201cI don\u2019t say that all of them, but a whole array of them, supported contacts with Russian representatives.\u201d The report did not elaborate. Russia was openly accused of interfering in favour of Trump during the campaign. The Obama administration claimed Russian authorities hacked damaging Democratic party emails that were then leaked to WikiLeaks. Russian president Vladimir Putin denied the claims. After Trump\u2019s election he was quick to call for a new era of \u201cfully fledged relations\u201d between Washington and Moscow. The American Civil Liberties Union is trying to tap into anxiety about civil liberties under Trump to raise some cash. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has spoken of his determination to dismantle Obama\u2019s flagship health insurance policy as soon as possible. After speaking to Trump, McConnell said: \u201cIt\u2019s pretty high on our agenda, as you know. I would be shocked if we didn\u2019t move forward and keep our commitment to the American people.\u201d During the campaign Trump promised to immediately repeal Obamacare. But some commentators predict he may get cold feet because such a move would leave millions of Americans without health cover, and he has no alternative to help them. Pundits on The Weeds, Vox\u2019s policy podcast, suggested he may be deploy a constantly extended sunset clause to keep Obamacare going. Meanwhile, health campaigners have pledged to wage \u201ctotal war\u201d in defence of Obamacare, according to Politico. In the UK chancellor Philip Hammond, is anxious that Trump\u2019s protectionism could damage Britain. Hammond was asked by the BBC if he thought free trade deals needed to be fundamentally rethought, as Trump suggests. He suggested he didn\u2019t: We believe that free trade and open markets are good for prosperity, good for the protection of jobs in this economy. But we do also recognise the concerns that there are around dumping and unfair practices, and it\u2019s about getting the right balance in the global trading system so that we can have the benefits of open markets, while being properly and appropriately protected from unfair practices. Andrew Sparrow is following this and all the other Trump fallout in British politics at Politics Live. It was white women who pushed Trump to victory, according to exit poll data. Rejecting the candidate who had aimed to be America\u2019s first female president, 53% of white women voted for Trump, according to CNN exit polls. White women without a college degree supported Trump over Hillary Clinton by nearly a two to one margin. White women with a college degree were more evenly divided, with 45% supporting Trump, compared with 51% supporting Clinton. Women of color, in contrast, voted overwhelmingly for Clinton: 94% of black women supported her, and 68% of Latino women. While exit polling data has flaws, the early responses underline a stark racial divide among American women: the majority of white women embraced Trump and his platform, while women of color rejected him. The strong support for Trump among white women suggests that many of them, if not \u201covertly racist\u201d, simply \u201cdon\u2019t think racism is a big deal\u201d, said Mikki Kendall, a feminist cultural critic. Politics Weekly, The Guardian\u2019s political podcast, analyses Trump\u2019s victory and looks ahead to a Trump presidency. Anushka Asthana is joined by Gary Younge, Randeep Ramesh, Hannah Peaker and Mona Chalabi Donald Trump is heading for the White House today after being elected as the 45th US president. Barack Obama is still in charge for now but he will host President-elect Trump at a meeting in the Oval Office as part of the transition of power. The meeting at (11am EST) could be an awkward encounter after what was said during a bitter campaign in which Obama branded Trump \u201cunfit\u201d for the presidency and \u201cwoefully unprepared\u201d. But part of Obama\u2019s job now is to help prepare Trump for the presidency and he has urged American\u2019s to respect the shock election result. Speaking from White House he said: \u201cThat\u2019s what the country needs \u2013 a sense of unity; a sense of inclusion; a respect for our institutions, our way of life, rule of law; and a respect for each other.\u201d But many have been in no mood heed that call for unity. Thousands of demonstrators crowded into streets and surrounding his buildings in major American cities on Wednesday night, shouting \u201cnot my president.\u201d Some held banners saying \u201cShe got more votes\u201d a reference to Hillary Clinton appearing poised to win the popular vote. Bernie Sanders reacted to Trump\u2019s victory by acknowledging that he successfully tapped into antiestablishment rage but Sanders vowed to continue to challenge him. And international leaders have also been struggling in their own way to come to terms with Trump\u2019s victory. Here\u2019s some key questions we\u2019ve been asking - and answering - since Trump\u2019s victory. Who will be appointed to Trump\u2019s cabinet? Will Trump destroy America? Why were the polls so wrong? How did the world\u2019s press cover Trump\u2019s victory? What will President Trump do? Readers outside the US: what does Trump\u2019s win mean to you? Did the Simpsons really predict a Trump victory? What\u2019s happening today The current and future first ladies, Michelle Obama and Melania Trump will also meet in the White House. Wonder if there will be chats about plagiarism? A US judge accused of bias by Donald Trump because of his Mexican heritage is to hold a pre-trial hearing on Thursday in a class-action lawsuit over the president-elect\u2019s now-defunct Trump University. US district judge Gonzalo Curiel is holding the hearing to instruct the jury and examine what evidence to allow at trial, which begins on 28 November. Presidents enjoy immunity from their official duties, but this does not extend to acts alleged to have taken place prior to taking office. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has spoken to the president elect by phone and is due to meet him in New York next week. Trump\u2019s unexpected victory has fanned Japan\u2019s anxiety about Washington\u2019s commitment to security arrangements in the face of a rising China and a volatile North Korea. Asia-Pacific markets staged a huge recovery after an election day wobble, as the region followed the lead of the US and Europe. There has been a rush of interest from Americans in emigrating to New Zealand. In the past 24 hours, the website of Immigration New Zealand (INZ) received 56,300 visits from the US \u2013 a huge rise on its daily average of 2,300.",

In July, Trump told the New York Times he would not necessarily come to the aid of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia \u2013 unless they had first stumped up enough cash into Nato coffers. </p> <p>Nato has recently been ramping up its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/27/military-build-up-along-russias-border-no-cause-for-alarm\">military exercises in the Baltics</a> in response to what it sees as a growing Kremlin threat. In December the 173rd US airborne unit is due to train with Latvian troops at a former Soviet military base. But it is unclear if such US-led exercises will continue. There is also uncertainty as to what will be Trump\u2019s Russia policy. The fear is that Trump will effectively concede eastern Europe to Moscow as a \u201csphere of influence\u201d. </p> <p>This would give Vladimir Putin, Russia\u2019s president, a free hand to create havoc in the Baltics, raising the spectre of cyber attacks, subversion of democratic elections and even covert Russian invasion, similar to the events of 2014 in east Ukraine and Crimea. <strong>Luke Harding</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/11/canada/giv-15726ebcfErVSXXgD/\" data-alt=\"Canada\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/11/canada/giv-15726ebcfErVSXXgD/\">Canada</a> </figure>  <p>The possible <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/15/trump-impact-on-canada-us-trade-relations-nafta-republicans\">impact of a Trump presidency on trade</a> is the main worry. Of Canada\u2019s goods and services, 72% exports go to the US, representing 23% of the country\u2019s GDP and 2.5m jobs. </p> <p>Trump\u2019s promise to renegotiate Nafta (North American Free Trade Agreement), which he called \u201cthe worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere\u201d, has alarmed Ottawa. But analysts point out that much of the two countries\u2019 trade is also governed by World Trade Organisation rules, and the US ambassador to Canada has said Canada would be willing to look again at the agreement, in a gesture of goodwill towards the new administration.</p> <p>Canadians are also worried by Trump\u2019s views on climate change (he termed it \u201ca Chinese hoax\u201d) and the consequences, not just for the UN Paris agreement but bilateral pacts such as the deal struck by Barack Obama and the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, to limit methane emissions from the oil and gas industry. </p> <p>Trump could prove positive for the Canadian oil industry, suffering like many from low prices: TransCanada\u2019s planned Keystone XL pipeline, carrying oil from Alberta to a US terminal in Nebraska, was rejected by the Obama administration after six years of review.</p> <p>Trump has said he would approve the project, which would give Canadian oil companies easier and so more profitable access to international markets, if it were resubmitted \u2013 as long as the US benefited from its construction and got \u201ca share of the profits\u201d. <strong>Jon Henley</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/11/france/giv-15726lcTXoRid96HO/\" data-alt=\"France\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/11/france/giv-15726lcTXoRid96HO/\">France</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cTheir world collapses.

More than 40 polls in the last two years have consistently shown her finishing second, or winning the first round of France\u2019s presidential elections, on 23 April 2017.</p> <p>After that, conventional wisdom says Le Pen will be heavily defeated in the run-off stage by her rival, at present likely to be the veteran centre-right former prime minister Alain Jupp\u00e9, who is seen as a safe pair of hands after two hugely unpopular presidents.</p> <p>Some Le Pen policies \u2013 particularly that of taking France out of the euro \u2013 simply scare too many voters, and current polling says Le Pen would lose to Jupp\u00e9, backed by an anti-FN \u201cfront r\u00e9publicain\u201d, 34%-64%.</p> <p>After Brexit and Trump, we know polls can be wrong. For them to be wrong by 30 percentage points would be extraordinary. But the same factors that drove Trump\u2019s victory are clearly in play in France. Le Pen as the country\u2019s president cannot be completely ruled out, especially if Jupp\u00e9 does not make it to the second round. <strong>Jon Henley</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/11/iran/giv-1572690ryaxox1K8B/\" data-alt=\"Iran\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/11/iran/giv-1572690ryaxox1K8B/\">Iran</a> </figure>  <p>All eyes are on how Trump\u2019s presidency will play out vis-\u00e0-vis last year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/03/trump-attacks-clinton-scandal-us-400-million-iran-nuclear-deal\">landmark nuclear deal</a>, which was widely praised as a triumph of diplomacy that averted the risk of another war in the Middle East. </p> <p>Despite his speech in March to the pro-Israel lobby Aipac (American Israel Public Affairs Committee), during which he said his first priority was to \u201cdismantle the disastrous deal with Iran\u201d, it is still unclear what path Trump will follow in office. He has contradicted himself on the deal, previously conceding that it would be hard to rip it up without European support.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s lack of credibility among traditional European allies of the US led some to think that his victory would be unlikely to cause much trouble for Tehran. Iranian leaders insist that the nuclear accord is an international treaty whose fate also rests in the hands of Europe, as well as Russia and China. But Iran knows that while Trump may not be able to tear up the deal, he can certainly stifle Iran\u2019s access to the global market. </p> <p>Trump\u2019s cosiness with Israel makes Iran fearful of war but his positive relationship with Vladimir Putin is a source of optimism. <strong>Saeed Kamali Dehghan</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/11/iraq-andsyria/giv-15726YW3ci0rRtzS7/\" data-alt=\"Iraq and Syria\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/11/iraq-andsyria/giv-15726YW3ci0rRtzS7/\">Iraq and Syria</a> </figure>  <p>Trump has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/01/us-military-iraq-syria-sean-macfarland-republican-carpet-bomb-isis\">committed to defeating Islamic State</a>, and has said that one of his priorities on taking office would be to convene top generals to discuss new operations against the jihadi group. This commitment, and his openness to forging an alliance with Russia, meant his victory was met with despair among the Syrian opposition and with delight in Damascus. Russian jets and other military support have been crucial in turning the tide of the civil war in favour of the Assad regime.</p> <p>Trump has also suggested he would not commit to limiting ground forces in Iraq or Syria. He may face an immediate test on this front if the slow battle for Mosul, the group\u2019s last major stronghold in Iraq, is still dragging on when he takes office. Trump has condemned the offensive as a \u201ctotal disaster\u201d, saying troops were \u201cbogged down\u201d, though he has not made any clear suggestions for an alternative campaign.<br></p> <p>Baghdad is expected to fiercely resist any move by Trump to make good on his pledge to \u201ctake the oil\u201d from Iraq to compensate for US spending in the country following the 2003 invasion. Oil is the main source of income for the Iraqi government, and legal and oil experts say plundering its reserves by force would be illegal under international law. <strong>Emma Graham-Harrison</strong><br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/11/israel/giv-15726wBaXnpIB3CCB/\" data-alt=\"Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/11/israel/giv-15726wBaXnpIB3CCB/\">Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories</a> </figure>  <p>A Trump presidency does not bode well for the moribund Middle East peace process, which broke down in 2014. Since then there has been conflict in Gaza, followed by a wave of violence between Palestinians and Israelis, which began last October and only subsided in the spring.

          "bodyText": "An estimated 150,000 of America\u2019s 1.4 million armed forces personnel are stationed abroad. There are an estimated 35,000 US service personnel dotted about the Middle East, but the US does not release precise information on all their locations Afghanistan barely featured in the election campaign, but when Donald Trump takes office he will not be able to ignore what is now America\u2019s longest war. Thousands of US troops are still stationed there, the security situation is deteriorating as the Taliban threaten cities and consolidate control of rural areas, and Isis has joined the war. Although American forces are not officially in a combat role, 11 have died there this year, making it a deadlier theatre of operations for the US military than Iraq or Syria. The Taliban responded to the US election result by calling on Trump to withdraw America\u2019s troops, but advisers will warn him that without the backing of foreign airpower and other military expertise the country is likely to fall to the Taliban. His strong stance on fighting Isis and \u201cIslamic terrorism\u201d means he is unlikely to hand control of a country \u2013 where thousands of American troops died \u2013 to a scarcely less hardline group. He has also expressed concerns about nuclear weapons in neighbouring Pakistan. Trump has repeatedly called for US allies to pay more towards their own security, but there is almost no cash to be had in Afghanistan, which is already largely dependent on foreign aid for its budget and is one of the poorest nations in the world. He is likely to be stuck then with the multibillion dollar bill for the US presence and support of Afghan troops. Emma Graham-Harrison The Baltic states are nervous about whether a Trump administration would defend them in the event of a Russian attack. In July, Trump told the New York Times he would not necessarily come to the aid of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia \u2013 unless they had first stumped up enough cash into Nato coffers. Nato has recently been ramping up its military exercises in the Baltics in response to what it sees as a growing Kremlin threat. In December the 173rd US airborne unit is due to train with Latvian troops at a former Soviet military base. But it is unclear if such US-led exercises will continue. There is also uncertainty as to what will be Trump\u2019s Russia policy. The fear is that Trump will effectively concede eastern Europe to Moscow as a \u201csphere of influence\u201d. This would give Vladimir Putin, Russia\u2019s president, a free hand to create havoc in the Baltics, raising the spectre of cyber attacks, subversion of democratic elections and even covert Russian invasion, similar to the events of 2014 in east Ukraine and Crimea. Luke Harding The possible impact of a Trump presidency on trade is the main worry. Of Canada\u2019s goods and services, 72% exports go to the US, representing 23% of the country\u2019s GDP and 2.5m jobs. Trump\u2019s promise to renegotiate Nafta (North American Free Trade Agreement), which he called \u201cthe worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere\u201d, has alarmed Ottawa. But analysts point out that much of the two countries\u2019 trade is also governed by World Trade Organisation rules, and the US ambassador to Canada has said Canada would be willing to look again at the agreement, in a gesture of goodwill towards the new administration. Canadians are also worried by Trump\u2019s views on climate change (he termed it \u201ca Chinese hoax\u201d) and the consequences, not just for the UN Paris agreement but bilateral pacts such as the deal struck by Barack Obama and the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, to limit methane emissions from the oil and gas industry. Trump could prove positive for the Canadian oil industry, suffering like many from low prices: TransCanada\u2019s planned Keystone XL pipeline, carrying oil from Alberta to a US terminal in Nebraska, was rejected by the Obama administration after six years of review. Trump has said he would approve the project, which would give Canadian oil companies easier and so more profitable access to international markets, if it were resubmitted \u2013 as long as the US benefited from its construction and got \u201ca share of the profits\u201d. Jon Henley \u201cTheir world collapses. Ours is being built,\u201d tweeted Florian Philippot, a Front National vice president, and Marine Le Pen\u2019s righthand man, as Trump headed for victory. Trump\u2019s win certainly makes a president Le Pen more plausible. More than 40 polls in the last two years have consistently shown her finishing second, or winning the first round of France\u2019s presidential elections, on 23 April 2017. After that, conventional wisdom says Le Pen will be heavily defeated in the run-off stage by her rival, at present likely to be the veteran centre-right former prime minister Alain Jupp\u00e9, who is seen as a safe pair of hands after two hugely unpopular presidents. Some Le Pen policies \u2013 particularly that of taking France out of the euro \u2013 simply scare too many voters, and current polling says Le Pen would lose to Jupp\u00e9, backed by an anti-FN \u201cfront r\u00e9publicain\u201d, 34%-64%. After Brexit and Trump, we know polls can be wrong. For them to be wrong by 30 percentage points would be extraordinary. But the same factors that drove Trump\u2019s victory are clearly in play in France. Le Pen as the country\u2019s president cannot be completely ruled out, especially if Jupp\u00e9 does not make it to the second round. Jon Henley All eyes are on how Trump\u2019s presidency will play out vis-\u00e0-vis last year\u2019s landmark nuclear deal, which was widely praised as a triumph of diplomacy that averted the risk of another war in the Middle East. Despite his speech in March to the pro-Israel lobby Aipac (American Israel Public Affairs Committee), during which he said his first priority was to \u201cdismantle the disastrous deal with Iran\u201d, it is still unclear what path Trump will follow in office. He has contradicted himself on the deal, previously conceding that it would be hard to rip it up without European support. Trump\u2019s lack of credibility among traditional European allies of the US led some to think that his victory would be unlikely to cause much trouble for Tehran. Iranian leaders insist that the nuclear accord is an international treaty whose fate also rests in the hands of Europe, as well as Russia and China. But Iran knows that while Trump may not be able to tear up the deal, he can certainly stifle Iran\u2019s access to the global market. Trump\u2019s cosiness with Israel makes Iran fearful of war but his positive relationship with Vladimir Putin is a source of optimism. Saeed Kamali Dehghan Trump has committed to defeating Islamic State, and has said that one of his priorities on taking office would be to convene top generals to discuss new operations against the jihadi group. This commitment, and his openness to forging an alliance with Russia, meant his victory was met with despair among the Syrian opposition and with delight in Damascus. Russian jets and other military support have been crucial in turning the tide of the civil war in favour of the Assad regime. Trump has also suggested he would not commit to limiting ground forces in Iraq or Syria. He may face an immediate test on this front if the slow battle for Mosul, the group\u2019s last major stronghold in Iraq, is still dragging on when he takes office. Trump has condemned the offensive as a \u201ctotal disaster\u201d, saying troops were \u201cbogged down\u201d, though he has not made any clear suggestions for an alternative campaign. Baghdad is expected to fiercely resist any move by Trump to make good on his pledge to \u201ctake the oil\u201d from Iraq to compensate for US spending in the country following the 2003 invasion. Oil is the main source of income for the Iraqi government, and legal and oil experts say plundering its reserves by force would be illegal under international law. Emma Graham-Harrison A Trump presidency does not bode well for the moribund Middle East peace process, which broke down in 2014. Since then there has been conflict in Gaza, followed by a wave of violence between Palestinians and Israelis, which began last October and only subsided in the spring. Trump\u2019s policy prescriptions \u2013 as enunciated by the candidate and his advisers \u2013 would further exacerbate tensions. Most controversially, Trump has promised to reverse decades of US policy by recognising Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital and moving the American embassy there. His aides also suggest that contrary to years of US policy \u2013 which has long regarded Israeli settlement building as an obstacle to peace \u2013 Trump would have no such objections. Such policies, if actively pursued when Trump gets into office in January, would coincide with the 50th anniversary of the occupation at a time when Palestinian faith in the peace process is at an all-time low. Trump\u2019s proposal to tear up the Iran nuclear deal, despite warnings from Tehran, also risks renewing tensions between Iran and Israel. Peter Beaumont Trump has caused consternation and alarm in Tokyo with suggestions that he is willing to make dramatic changes to the security glue that has held the US and Japan together for more than 60 years. Amid rising concern over Chinese military activity in the South China Sea and North Korea\u2019s apparently unstoppable acquisition of a viable nuclear deterrent, a Clinton victory would have given Japan the assurance it needed that bilateral security ties would remain untouched. Trump has hinted that his \u201cAmerica first\u201d mantra could mean the withdrawal of 47,000 US troops from Japan and another 28,500 ranged along the southern side of the heavily armed border that separates South and North Korea. The prospect of Trump weakening or even scrapping that guarantee would cause alarm in Tokyo, particularly after securing vows from Washington that the US would come to Japan\u2019s aid if China attempted to retake the disputed Senkaku islands by force. The East China Sea islands, known as the Diaoyu in China, are administered by Tokyo but claimed by Beijing. Perhaps most alarming is Trump\u2019s suggestion that Japan and South Korea should end their dependence on the US nuclear umbrella and develop their own nuclear deterrents. That, many analysts agree, could spark an Asia-Pacific arms race that would further destabilise an already tense region. Justin McCurry The Mexican peso plunged 13% as Trump headed to victory and America\u2019s southern neighbours were confronted with the prospect of a US president who had promised to rip up trade treaties, expel 5 million undocumented immigrants (many of them, according to him, \u201crapists\u201d and \u201ccriminals\u201d), and build a 2,000-mile border wall. Which if any of those pledges Trump would actually make good in office is anyone\u2019s guess. But many in Mexico expect at the very least the economy to suffer, particularly if he tears up Nafta as he has threatened to do. About 80% of Mexican exports go to the US and the governor of the Mexican central bank, Agust\u00edn Carstens, warned before the election that a Trump victory would be a \u201churricane\u201d for the country\u2019s economy.

Jon Henley Many Ukrainians feel they were let down in the level of support they received from the west for fighting Russia-backed separatists in the east of the country, but a Trump presidency brings a whole new level of fear.

Oh sure, listen to the grievances of enraged voters. But understanding them is different from indulging them, and the media and politicians \u2013 in the US and UK \u2013 have for too long conflated the two, encouraging the white victim narrative and stoking precisely the kind of nasty, race-baiting campaigns that led to Brexit and Trump (as the voter demographics have proved, the linking factor in Trump voters is not class but race).</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Both campaigns promised to turn the clock back to a time when white men were in the ascendence, and both were fronted by privately educated false prophets such as Nigel Farage and Trump, absurdly privileged buccaneers who style themselves as friends of the working classes while pushing policies that work against them. They have bleached language of meaning, boasting that they aren\u2019t \u201ccareer politicians\u201d (now a negative thing as opposed to someone who has devoted their life to public service), and they scorn \u201cexperts\u201d (who are now apparently the biggest threat to democracy).</p> <p>To call out voters for falling for damagingly racist and sexist messages is viewed by politicians as a vote-killer and dangerously snobby by the media, as though working-class people are precious toddlers who must be humoured and can\u2019t possibly be held responsible for any flawed thinking.</p> <p>There is no doubt the white working classes in the west have suffered in recent decades, yet no other demographic that has endured similarly straitened circumstances is indulged in this way. For decades, American politicians have demonised the black working classes who suffered far worse structural inequalities and for far longer \u2013 and Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/17/central-park-five-donald-trump-jogger-rape-case-new-york\">continues to do so today</a>.</p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/10/misogyny-us-election-voters\">Misogyny won the US election \u2013 let\u2019s stop indulging angry white men | Hadley Freeman</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58240b79e4b0822c310eca55\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-10T06:00:31.837Z\">6.00am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Trump's new Twitter account</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Given the Twitter silence \u2013 18 hours and counting \u2013 since the last tweet from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump\">@realDonaldTrump</a>, it\u2019s fair to guess that the president-elect hasn\u2019t regained control of his account since aides relieved him of tweeting duties ahead of polling day.</p> <p>But here comes a new account for Trump news: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/transition2017\">@transition2017</a>, which will deliver updates on the transition to a Trump administration.

OK, smug radical, if we\u2019re not the answer, let\u2019s hear you list the flourishing leftwing governments, describe how the left bridges its divide? And, of course, they have a point. The style and culture of the radical left is often shaped by university-educated young people (a group that includes me). They are a growing and diverse group; often they hail from modest backgrounds. But their priorities, their rhetoric and their outlook is often radically different to older working-class voters in small town England, France or the US. Both groups are critical to building a victorious electoral coalition, and yet they are, indeed, divided.</p> <p>That must change. Unless the left is rooted in working-class communities \u2013 from the diverse boroughs of London to the ex-mill towns of the north \u2013 unless it speaks a language that resonates with those it once saw as its natural constituency, shorn of contempt for working-class values or priorities, then it has no political future. </p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/10/the-left-needs-a-new-populism-fast\">The left needs a new populism fast.

And for your classism!\u201d the man shouted, echoed after each sentence by a friend with a bullhorn.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5823eac1e4b0199b93895581\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-10T03:46:20.548Z\">3.46am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-president-election-muslim-ban-immigrants-website-statement-removed-a7408466.html\">Reports</a> that Donald Trump\u2019s website no longer carries his statement promising a ban on Muslims entering the US are correct \u2013 but it\u2019s not simply that pledge that has disappeared.</p> <p>The whole archive of press releases previously at https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases has gone, with that url now directing visitors back to the homepage (where they are asked to contribute cash to the campaign).</p> <p>Deliberate move or technical hiccup? The latter is the less enthralling but perhaps more likely answer.</p> <p>A glitch discovered by gleeful social media users on polling day that allowed anyone to create their own banners on the page usually reserved for press releases was swiftly shut down by Trump techs BUT the fix seems to have been made by taking down the whole page.

He understood the fears and worries of, apparently, many American people and structured his pre-election arguments accordingly. Yet, I also believe that he is a populist. In other words, he said things just for the sake of being elected. No, he will not build a wall; he will not deport illegal immigrants and he will not do a number of things he promised to do, because he is incapable of doing them. He wanted to draw attention, but I doubt that he will be able to carry the burden of being the US President and he will undoubtedly let his supporters down in the next few months.</p> <p>-DSkrimizeas</p> <h2>This is Not Good</h2> <p>So how are we going to Make American Great Again? Trump is going to unite the country and rebuild the working class? Not for a second. Divide and conquer has been his method, and now that he has secured the win, the gloves are really going to come off. He\u2019s going to take down corrupt Washington, elites, and the rigged system? No fucking way. He\u2019s going to be the system, reap all the benefits he can for himself, and indulge in his power. Get ready for change, but not the sort that is going to help you, your family, or the nation. The insanity has just begun.</p> <p>-bw9009</p> <h2>The fear &amp; resentment are real</h2> <p>From my perspective as a man of Hispanic/Mexican descent, I feel angry that Trump\u2019s first remarks (re: rapists, murderers, etc.) were not met by any true reprimands. It has only reinforced in my mind what I have seen just below the surface of society, that in an area of the world where we have existed for about 500 years, we have been, and are still seen as second-class citizens. Trump\u2019s victory only crystallizes what many of us have known, but the majority, white culture simply pretended that we were all equal when it has never been about that. It has only ever been the ability to keep and not redistribute wealth as well as solidifying our social and legal structures that continually discriminate against minorities and communities of color.</p> <p>-William Mosqueda</p> <h2>It\u2019s not the fact that it\u2019s him. It\u2019s that people voted for him.</h2> <p>What made me saddest watching the election results play out was not so much Donald Trump being elected as what his election represents.

Trump\u2019s shocking victory, his ascension to the Presidency, is a sickening event in the history of the United States and liberal democracy. On January 20, 2017, we will bid farewell to the first African-American President\u2014a man of integrity, dignity, and generous spirit\u2014and witness the inauguration of a con who did little to spurn endorsement by forces of xenophobia and white supremacy. It is impossible to react to this moment with anything less than revulsion and profound anxiety. [...]</p> <p>It is all a dismal picture. Late last night, as the results were coming in from the last states, a friend called me full of sadness, full of anxiety about conflict, about war. Why not leave the country? But despair is no answer. To combat authoritarianism, to call out lies, to struggle honorably and fiercely in the name of American ideals\u2014that is what is left to do. That is all there is to do.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5823720de4b0822c310ec7e5\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-09T18:59:57.850Z\">6.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Video: Hillary Clinton concession</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/nov/09/hillary-clinton-concession-speech-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5b69v\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2878335\"            data-video-name=\"Hillary Clinton concession speech: \u2018I know it\u2019s painful\u2019 \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-58236a6fe4b0199b93895393\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/11/09/161109ClintonConcession_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/11/09/161109ClintonConcession.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/11/09/161109ClintonConcession_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/nov/09/hillary-clinton-concession-speech-video\">Hillary Clinton concession speech: \u2018I know it\u2019s painful\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>  </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58236ef9e4b0eda0192fdf0f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/megan-carpentier\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-09T18:54:22.900Z\">6.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">'They're in charge of everything now'</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Wheeling a case of wine and a 12-pack of beer out of the Total Wine and Spirits liquor superstore in Natick, Massachusetts, Maureen ( an older woman who declined to give her last name) called it \u201ca sad day.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re in charge of everything now,\u201d she said of Republicans with a heavy Boston accent as she loaded her purchases into her Subaru SUV.</p> <p>\u201cThe House, the Senate, the Supreme Court justices.

Here's why</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The polls were wrong. And because we are obsessed with predicting opinions rather than listening to them, we didn\u2019t see it coming. So, the world woke up believing that Republican candidate Donald Trump had a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/upshot/presidential-polls-forecast.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=upshot&amp;region=rank&amp;module=package&amp;version=highlights&amp;contentPlacement=2&amp;pgtype=sectionfront\">15%</a> chance of winning based on polling predictions \u2013 <a href=\"http://gwydir.demon.co.uk/jo/probability/calcdice.htm\">roughly</a> the same chance of rolling a total of six if you have two dice. Despite those odds, the next US president will be Donald Trump.</p> <p>I have a few ideas about what went wrong. In the four years I\u2019ve spent as a data journalist, I\u2019ve been concerned by how much faith the public has placed in polling. Just like you\u2019d check the weather before getting dressed, many people checked presidential polling numbers before heading out to vote. That\u2019s understandable. Politics can feel as unpredictable as the weather, and who wouldn\u2019t want to eliminate uncertainty? The world is a scary and confusing place right now.</p> <p>But those are two very different kinds of forecasts. One is based on natural science, the other on social science. People are different to planets \u2013 they can change their minds, they can decide to not share their opinions or they can flat out lie. And that\u2019s before you even get to some of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/datablog/2016/jan/27/dont-trust-the-polls-the-systemic-issues-that-make-voter-surveys-unreliable\">statistical issues</a> that make polling inaccurate.</p> <p>That\u2019s not new information. Polling analysts like me knew the numbers were inaccurate before Brexit happened. Despite that, the polling predictions kept coming.

We currently live in a world where opinions are buried and \u201ctolerance\u201d is pushed on people without an attempt to educate them. I was against both but not surprised that both were victorious.</p> <p>When you demand people accept something they refuse and that breeds anger and hate. So when people who will say the things that dwell in your mind but can\u2019t say arrive, you gravitate towards them regardless of the fact they may not have the all the same opinions as you. As a society we created this by expecting generations to accept a new world without fully helping them understand it. This new world is for the lost, scared and hateful and to some degree we all those three things. </p> <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/12044727\">WILL D</a>: \u201cClinton and the \u2018Establishment\u2019s\u2019 arrogance and complacency lost her the election. Just like Brexit, the establishment assumed that electing Trump as president was just a wild fantasy and would never ever happen in a million years! And therein lies the problem. The false sense of security, the gross misunderstanding of the mood of the people, the conceited belief that they were far superior to Trump and that when it came to actually voting, few people would actually vote for him.</p> <p>How wrong they were \u2026 There is this ever increasing loss of connection with the mood of the people, and ever increasing sense of being able to manipulate the people to believe they were the \u2018good guys\u2019. Democracy purports to be \u2018government by the people, for the people\u2019. But it hasn\u2019t been like that - ever. It probably won\u2019t under Trump either, but he represents a change of direction, and time will tell whether he will be as bad as the establishment and media fear.</p> <p><strong>Anonymous:</strong> \u201cAlthough the progressive side of politics couldn\u2019t believe a Trump victory was possible, it has been obvious to some of us for a long time that the dispossessed would eventually rise up against both the educated elites and the power elite. This has been their day. Those without a voice have been ignored by the approved avenues of discourse, which have until now simply shouted down and shut out the voices of the losers in our technocratic imperium. We have been told that in a meritocracy, losers have only themselves to blame and that there has been only one game in town which everyone must play. But the losers still have the vote \u2014 for now.</p> <p><em>You can share your pictures, videos and perspectives on the election result by clicking on the blue \u2018Contribute\u2019 button at the top and bottom of the live blog or by using the form <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/08/us-election-voting-polls-mood\">here</a>.</em></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5823230de4b0eda0192fdd52\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-09T13:23:09.048Z\">1.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There\u2019s a lot of people who\u2019ve fought with Donald Trump over the years, never expecting that he would one day become the next US president.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/joeypiazza/status/796335727562854400\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The President elect blocked me on Twitter 5 years ago because I called him a douche bag and he responded.

No one has a \u2018right\u2019 to the presidency, but for the most qualified candidate in history, and one manifestly more suited to the moment/addressing the very issues Trump voters said they wanted addressed, to lose to such an appalling excuse for a human is incomprehensible.</p> <p>I am sorry, world.

Hillary Clinton looks set to become the second nominee (hi, Al Gore!) to win the popular vote yet lose the electoral college in the past five presidential elections. And Bernie Sanders has issued a statement about Trump\u2019s win: Donald Trump tapped into the anger of a declining middle class that is sick and tired of establishment economics, establishment politics and the establishment media. People are tired of working longer hours for lower wages, of seeing decent paying jobs go to China and other low-wage countries, of billionaires not paying any federal income taxes and of not being able to afford a college education for their kids \u2013 all while the rich become very much richer. To the degree that Mr Trump is serious about pursuing policies that improve the lives of working families in this country, I and other progressives are prepared to work with him. To the degree that he pursues racist, sexist, xenophobic and anti-environment policies, we will vigorously oppose him. Protests in US cities There were peaceful demonstrations on Wednesday night against the Trump victory and the rhetoric employed by the now president-elect during the campaign. Most protesters dispersed in the early hours of Thursday. In New York city, several thousand people marched from Union Square to Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue, blocking streets and prompting police to assemble hasty barricades. At least four arrests were made when marchers were moved on to Trump International Hotel and Tower on Central Park West. In downtown Chicago, several thousand people marched to that city\u2019s Trump Tower, chanting \u201cNot my president!\u201d and \u201cOur bodies, our choice!\u201d. Thousands of demonstrators were also reported in Boston, heading from Boston Common to the Massachusetts statehouse. Other demonstrations have been taking place in Philadelphia, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Oakland, Seattle, Portland and Washington DC, where a crowd massed outside a newly opened Trump hotel and others gathered outside the White House. Smaller marches were reported in St Paul, Minnesota; Richmond, Virginia; Kansas City; Omaha, Nebraska; and Austin, Texas. Globally Asia-Pacific markets staged a huge recovery after an election day wobble, as the region followed the lead of the US and Europe. There has been a rush of interest from Americans in emigrating to New Zealand. In the past 24 hours, the website of Immigration New Zealand (INZ) received 56,300 visits from the US \u2013 a huge rise on its daily average of 2,300. And you should know Reports that Donald Trump\u2019s website no longer carries his statement promising a ban on Muslims entering the US are correct \u2013 but not as intriguing as they might seem. A glitch discovered by social media users on polling day that allowed anyone to create their own banners on the press releases page was swiftly shut down by Trump techs, but the fix seems to have been taking down the whole page. So: no Muslim ban press release. But no press releases at all. And yes, the Simpsons did predict President Trump. But those widely circulated pictures of cartoon Trump at the presidential podium? Not from 16 years ago, but from last year, after he announced his candidacy. As president-elect, Trump will see the daily intelligence briefings that are sent to President Obama. Former US secretary of state Madeleine Albright has been talking to the BBC Today programme about what happens now: It is my hope that when he is given his full intelligence briefings and sits in the Oval Office and listens to people with foreign policy background, then he will understand that statements such as the ones that he made are dangerous for the United States; and that he will see that the world is not a zero-sum world and that we have to, and will need to, cooperate with others. When America talked about America First before, it did not lead to the best results. And so my hope is that he is a smart man and that he will absorb the information when he sees it \u2026 The main thing for the president of the United States is to remember that he is president of the United States and that our interests vis a vis what the Russians are doing are very important, and that our friends and allies in central and eastern Europe have been our friends and allies for a very, very long time. Protests are quietening now, as parts of the US tick over into Thursday. In New York, crowds have pretty much disappeared. The marchers in Chicago have dispersed, with just a small group remaining of the several thousands earlier reported. Demonstrations in Oakland \u2013 it\u2019s still not 11pm there \u2013 are still going. We\u2019ve had no more reports of arrests. A lot will be written about how Trump\u2019s victory represents a backlash of rage from the white working classes, writes Hadley Freeman: Here\u2019s an alternative take: we\u2019ve heard enough of white rage now. Oh sure, listen to the grievances of enraged voters. But understanding them is different from indulging them, and the media and politicians \u2013 in the US and UK \u2013 have for too long conflated the two, encouraging the white victim narrative and stoking precisely the kind of nasty, race-baiting campaigns that led to Brexit and Trump (as the voter demographics have proved, the linking factor in Trump voters is not class but race). Both campaigns promised to turn the clock back to a time when white men were in the ascendence, and both were fronted by privately educated false prophets such as Nigel Farage and Trump, absurdly privileged buccaneers who style themselves as friends of the working classes while pushing policies that work against them. They have bleached language of meaning, boasting that they aren\u2019t \u201ccareer politicians\u201d (now a negative thing as opposed to someone who has devoted their life to public service), and they scorn \u201cexperts\u201d (who are now apparently the biggest threat to democracy). To call out voters for falling for damagingly racist and sexist messages is viewed by politicians as a vote-killer and dangerously snobby by the media, as though working-class people are precious toddlers who must be humoured and can\u2019t possibly be held responsible for any flawed thinking. There is no doubt the white working classes in the west have suffered in recent decades, yet no other demographic that has endured similarly straitened circumstances is indulged in this way. For decades, American politicians have demonised the black working classes who suffered far worse structural inequalities and for far longer \u2013 and Trump continues to do so today. Given the Twitter silence \u2013 18 hours and counting \u2013 since the last tweet from @realDonaldTrump, it\u2019s fair to guess that the president-elect hasn\u2019t regained control of his account since aides relieved him of tweeting duties ahead of polling day. But here comes a new account for Trump news: @transition2017, which will deliver updates on the transition to a Trump administration. So far it\u2019s just this: The account follows one person: @realDonaldTrump. (Not even a look-in for @mike_pence.) Of course, come January 2017, Trump will also inherit the @POTUS account and its 11.6 million followers \u2013 a step down from his own 14.1 million. After a Trump victory, what next for the left, in the US and beyond, asks Owen Jones: Centrists have an easy retort. OK, smug radical, if we\u2019re not the answer, let\u2019s hear you list the flourishing leftwing governments, describe how the left bridges its divide? And, of course, they have a point. The style and culture of the radical left is often shaped by university-educated young people (a group that includes me). They are a growing and diverse group; often they hail from modest backgrounds. But their priorities, their rhetoric and their outlook is often radically different to older working-class voters in small town England, France or the US. Both groups are critical to building a victorious electoral coalition, and yet they are, indeed, divided. That must change. Unless the left is rooted in working-class communities \u2013 from the diverse boroughs of London to the ex-mill towns of the north \u2013 unless it speaks a language that resonates with those it once saw as its natural constituency, shorn of contempt for working-class values or priorities, then it has no political future. Trump will meet the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, in New York next week. A Japanese foreign ministry official told AFP news agency the two would meet on 17 November, having spoken on the phone for about 20 minutes following Trump\u2019s election win. Abe will travel via New York to Peru for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit. AFP reports: On the phone, Abe \u201ctalked about the importance of the bilateral relationship and the Japan-US alliance\u201d, which he stressed underpins the peace and stability of the Asia-Pacific region, the foreign ministry official said. In response, Trump said he hoped to strengthen the US-Japan relationship further, the official said. Trump also said he appreciated Abe\u2019s economic policy and looked forward to working with him, she said. She declined to elaborate on what else they discussed. In cities across the US, protesters have gathered on Wednesday night for peaceful demonstrations against the Trump victory and the rhetoric employed by the now president-elect during the campaign. In New York city, several thousand people marched from Union Square to Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue, blocking streets and prompting police to assemble hasty barricades. At least four arrests were made when marchers were moved on to Trump International Hotel and Tower, Trump\u2019s property on Central Park West. In downtown Chicago, several thousand people marched through the Loop to that city\u2019s Trump Tower, chanting \u201cNot my president!\u201d and \u201cOur bodies, our choice!\u201d. Thousands of demonstrators were also reported in Boston, heading from Boston Common to the Massachusetts statehouse. Other demonstrations have been taking place in Philadelphia, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Oakland, Seattle, Portland and Washington DC, where a crowd massed outside a newly opened Trump hotel and others gathered outside the White House. Smaller marches were reported in St Paul, Minnesota; Richmond, Virginia; Kansas City; Omaha, Nebraska; and Austin, Texas. The financial markets might be cheering up, but how have the world\u2019s newspapers reacted to Trump\u2019s win? France\u2019s Lib\u00e9ration sees the dark side: The UK Daily Telegraph is A BIT SHOUTY: And British tabloids opt for variations on a \u201cwhaaaat?\u201d theme: Meanwhile, in the financial world, the stock markets have proceeded magisterially today despite a background of major tectonic shifts in the financial landscape. Here are the main points: Asia Pacific shares have bounced back up strongly and recovered Wednesday\u2019s losses. Japan\u2019s Nikkei is up 5.71% at 17,178.87. ASX/S&amp;P200 is up 2.74% at 5,297.70, Kospi is at 1,995.75 (1.91%) Hong Kong is up 2% at 22,863.10. The US dollar has dipped against the yen at 105.3270 but still up strongly overnight. Aussie dollar is up at US76.61c. S&amp;P has maintained the US on AA+ investment grade rating, warning that Trump\u2019s inexperience creates uncertainty about policy settings. Yuan fix at the lowest point since 2010. Reserve Bank of New Zealand has cut rates to 1.75%, a new record low. Brent crude is down 7% amid warnings about global trade. Readers have been sending in their photos of signs and placards at the anti-Trump protests in New York and Chicago. At least four arrests have been made at the New York protest; many demonstrators have now cleared the area where police had started to act. Scott Bixby, at the scene of the protest in New York, says a number of people have been arrested; the precise number and details aren\u2019t yet clear: It might have been accidental, but it appears Cher (not a fan of Trump) has joined the New York protest: Yes, here she is: The police have now shifted the barricades to prevent more people from joining the protest outside Trump Tower in New York. Some people are shrugging their shoulders and going home. Others are marching to another Trump property at Columbus Circle to continue the protest despite the fact that Trump does not, in fact, live there. At Trump International Hotel and Tower, Donald Trump\u2019s property on Central Park West has become a new locus for protesters who have been prevented from joining the protest at Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue. The building\u2019s guests and residents could be seen observing the several thousand protesters congregated at its base, which the NYPD \u2013 either not anticipating protests here, or more concerned with protecting the president-elect\u2019s Fifth Avenue residence \u2013 did not cordon off with more than a single cursory barricade. Standing astride a plastic barrier for pedestrians across the street, a young man dressed in black performed a call-and-response monologue, echoed by nearly five dozen protesters standing side-by-side on the wall. \u201cI am a native New Yorker! I have lived here for 32 years! I grew up here! And we are putting you on notice! For your racism! For your fascism! For your heterosexism! And for your classism!\u201d the man shouted, echoed after each sentence by a friend with a bullhorn. Reports that Donald Trump\u2019s website no longer carries his statement promising a ban on Muslims entering the US are correct \u2013 but it\u2019s not simply that pledge that has disappeared. The whole archive of press releases previously at https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases has gone, with that url now directing visitors back to the homepage (where they are asked to contribute cash to the campaign). Deliberate move or technical hiccup? The latter is the less enthralling but perhaps more likely answer. A glitch discovered by gleeful social media users on polling day that allowed anyone to create their own banners on the page usually reserved for press releases was swiftly shut down by Trump techs BUT the fix seems to have been made by taking down the whole page. So: no Muslim ban press release. But no press releases at all. We\u2019ve been hearing from readers taking part in anti-Trump demonstrations across the country. Elliot Casey got in touch to say he\u2019s part of a peaceful protest in Winston-Salem, North Carolina: \u201cThe crowd is marching through to downtown Winston Salem chanting: \u2018Not my president\u2019.\u201d We\u2019ve also heard from protesters in Richmond, VA; Chicago, Boston and Seattle: Protests where you are? Share your stories with us. The election of Donald Trump has the potential to radically redraw the geopolitical landscape in Asia, experts have told the Guardian. From threatened tariffs on Chinese imports to a potential withdrawal of 47,000 US troops from Japan, from South China Sea disputes to nuclear deterrence, the implications of a Trump presidency could be felt in many ways on this side of the Pacific. Our correspondents across the region look at what President Trump could mean for China, Japan, Korea \u2013 North and South \u2013 India, the Philippines and beyond. As the protesters who had marched all the way from Union Square \u2013 some 35 blocks downtown \u2013 continued past Trump Tower, a comparatively smaller crowd still numbering in the thousands congregated in front of the president-elect\u2019s building. \u201cFuck your tower! Fuck your wall!\u201d the crowd chanted at Trump Tower\u2019s brass-escutcheoned facade, as scores of NYPD officers manned hastily-erected barricades, behind which stood eight department of sanitation trucks filled with dirt. Nina, a forty-something actor who lives in Manhattan, told the Guardian that the protest felt less like a call-to-arms than a vigil for the promise of America. \u201cI\u2019m distraught at the decision,\u201d said Nina, who declined to share her surname for professional reasons. \u201cHe\u2019s a dangerous man \u2013 he\u2019s a hothead, a megalomaniac. \u201cIt just feels like he\u2019s doesn\u2019t truly have our best wishes at heart.\u201d She was too stunned by the election results to even muster anger, she said. \u201cI never thought it was possible; it truly didn\u2019t seem possible. I\u2019m embarrassed for America.\u201d Asked by the Guardian what she wanted out of tonight\u2019s protest, Nina said: \u201cI\u2019d like them to reverse the frikken\u2019 decision! But that\u2019s obviously not going to happen \u2026 The compunction was just to lend my voice, lend my body. \u201cI just felt helpless. He\u2019s a horrible, horrible man, not the leader of the America I live in. Or the America I thought I lived in.\u201d Nina said that Trump, who is as part of the cultural fabric of New York as street meat and subway rats, is an affront to the spirit and soul of the most diverse city in the world. \u201cI like humanity, I like mankind \u2013 it\u2019s why I like being a New Yorker,\u201d she said. \u201cAre we really going back to where we thought there were people who were lesser or better? That just feels tragic \u2013 for us and for them and for the world.\u201d The election of Donald Trump has resulted in a rush of interest from Americans in emigrating to New Zealand. In the past 24 hours, the website of Immigration New Zealand (INZ) received 56,300 visits from the US \u2013 a huge rise on its daily average of 2,300. Within the same period, more than 7,000 Americans registered interest in moving to New Zealand, more than double the monthly average. Similar spikes of interest in New Zealand were noted by INZ from Britons in the months after Brexit, with New Zealand seen as an ideal resettlement nation due to its shared cultural history with Britain. The New Zealand Now website \u2013 which contains detailed information on living, working, studying and investing in New Zealand \u2013 received 70,500 visits from the US in the past 24 hours, or 69,000 more than its daily average. Here are some of the latest images from demonstrations in cities \u2013 Democratic-leaning cities \u2013 around the US. New York Chicago Oakland Philadelphia Seattle Meanwhile, in Chicago, Zach Stafford reports: Protesters have moved onto Michigan Avenue stopping all traffic. Police have been surprisingly supportive of their march everywhere. Chicago Trump protesters are now focusing their march on shutting down Lake Shore Drive and don\u2019t seem to be stopping soon. CPD officer just told me they\u2019ve blocked off LSD up to Fullerton Avenue \u2013 3.5 miles (5.6km) from Grant Park. Traffic is at a standstill. \u2018It\u2019s just beginning! We can do this! It\u2019s just getting started,\u2019 a woman yells outside of her car as other honk in support. The New York protesters are being moved to march north up Fifth Avenue, away from Trump Tower and on to the most expensive stretch of residential real estate on Earth, Scott Bixby reports from the scene: As the temperature dropped and the crowds at the Trump Tower barricades grew tighter, the rapport between protesters and the NYPD officers manning the scene grew commensurately chilly. In the early part of the protests, the mood was downright chummy \u2013 protesters helped officers over the barricades, who then joked \u201cOK, you next!\u201d But when officers with plastic handcuffs were seen assembling at the barricades, the crowd grew suspicious. \u201cYo, what do you plan on doing with those cuffs? We\u2019re not doing anything!\u201d a protester shouted at a stonefaced officer, who declined to speak with the Guardian. \u201cWe don\u2019t talk to protesters,\u201d the officer said. On a street corner home to storefronts for Bulgaria, Prada, Tiffany &amp; Co, Bergdorf Goodman and, of course, president-elect Donald Trump\u2019s triplex penthouse, protester Joe Gordon saw the election of Trump as a watershed moment for left-wing politics and activism. \u201cIt\u2019s an awareness-shift,\u201d Gordon said. Had Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton won the election, \u201cit likely would have been more of the same\u201d, but Trump\u2019s election \u201cwill make people wake up\u201d. If you\u2019re protesting against the election of Donald Trump, do tell us why. One young man has scaled the traffic light on the northwest corner of East 57th Street and Fifth Avenue, kitty-corner to Trump Tower, to cheers from nearby protesters. \u201cNo democracy, no peace!\u201d he shouted. When that proved unpopular, a chant of \u201cFuck Donald Trump!\u201d sparked waves of the chants up and down the street. Joe Gordon, a 19-year-old from Brooklyn, told the Guardian that he, along with other protesters, \u201cdespise\u201d Trump, who \u201crepresents hatred, corruption and intolerance\u201d. \u201cThe entire political system is set up\u201d to protect the elite over minorities, Gordon said, and at the apex of that broken system is the president-elect. You can read our latest roundup from the protests here. A snapshot: Donald Trump\u2019s unexpected win ignited massive protests that continued on the day after a long election night, with thousands of demonstrators shutting down major streets and surrounding the real estate mogul\u2019s buildings in cities across America. As US voters and international leaders began to come to terms with the reality of a Republican presidency led by the former reality television star, anti-Trump activists launched impromptu protests criticizing the racism, sexism and xenophobia that they say the president-elect has made mainstream. The demonstrations \u2013 including in New York City, Chicago and San Francisco \u2013 swelled and drew large police responses as election tallies on Wednesday signaled that Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton appeared to have won the popular vote, despite losing the electoral college and presidential race. A brief diversion from ongoing protests to ask another big question of the day: did the Simpsons predict the Trump presidency? Well, yes, as Esther Addley explains: In 2000, Bart to the Future, an episode of the Simpsons in which Bart imagines his coming years, showed Lisa Simpson taking over as \u201cAmerica\u2019s first straight female president\u201d from an outgoing President Trump. \u201cAs you know,\u201d she tells her team in the Oval Office, \u201cwe\u2019ve inherited quite a budget crunch from President Trump.\u201d She asks how bad things have got, to be told the country is broke, as the previous regime invested in the nation\u2019s children but \u201ccreated a generation of ultra-strong super-criminals\u201d. (Those widely-circulated images of Trump at the presidential podium, though, weren\u2019t quite so prescient; they come from a special episode put together after the reality TV star announced his candidacy in 2015.) Waving homemade signs with messages like \u201cUnited Against Hate\u201d, \u201cWomen Against Trump\u201d and \u201cImpeach the Fascist\u201d, tens of thousands of protestors \u2013 mostly college-aged \u2013 swarmed from all directions to the corner of Fifth Avenue and East 56th Street, the home of president-elect Donald Trump and his eponymous Tower. Chanting \u201cNot my president!\u201d and \u201cWe! Reject! The president-elect!\u201d, the protestors were met with scores of NYPD officers at each corner of the Midtown Manhattan block on which Trump Tower is located, and were quickly corralled by interlocking fences to form an angry (but as yet non-violent) perimeter. \u201cDo you have any idea what Mike Pence did to the public-sector unions in Indiana?\u201d one male protestor, who declined to be identified, shouted at nearby NYPD officers watching the barricades. \u201cYou\u2019re not even gonna have a fucking union!\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re just doing their jobs!\u201d another protestor shouted back. \u201cThe Germans did their fucking jobs, all the way to the concentration camp,\u201d he responded. Protests are spreading: CNN is reporting that there are demonstrations taking place in at least seven cities right now. Here are some images of marchers in San Francisco: In Washington DC: In Seattle: Thousands of Chicagoans took to the streets Wednesday evening as shock permeated through a democratic city that supported Clinton almost completely in the exit polls. Calling it an \u201cEmergency Trump Protest\u201d, people from an array of communities and social movements virtually shut down the city during rush hour traffic and yelled \u201cTrump is not my president\u201d through the city streets. While Chicago has become known for these types of demonstrations over recent years due to a committed Black Lives Matter network fighting to end police violence, this demonstration drew people from all walks of life to demonstrate, with their anger being their focus. \u201cI\u2019m incredibly upset. I\u2019m angry,\u201d said Parker Smith as she held a sign stating \u201cMy Body, My Choice\u201d outside the president-elect\u2019s Chicago hotel tower. \u201cThis has been just a lot to deal with and I\u2019m very worried for the next four years.\u201d As protesters massed for hours outside the luxury building, the chants moved from black lives to gay rights to women\u2019s health. But even with so much anxiety about the future pulsing through the demonstration, many saw this coming together of people of varying ethnicities, religions and sexualities as hope. \u201cThis is the America I identify with,\u201d said Nicole Endenova, a young woman of color, as she stared at the crowds. Meanwhile, on a trip to New Zealand (from where he\u2019ll go on to Antarctica on a pre-planned visit), US secretary of state John Kerry says he has told state department officials \u201cto be as helpful as possible\u201d to the incoming administration: One of the beautiful things of democracy \u2013 and we particularly pride ourselves in the United States \u2013 is that we have this amazing peaceful transfer of power. And we will do everything in our power, as I have instructed our team, to work with the incoming administration as fully and openly as possible, to be as helpful as possible, so that the transfer of power will be as smooth as it possibly can without missing a beat on the important issues before us. Reports from the New York city protests say roads have been blocked as protesters mass between Union Square and Trump Tower. My colleague Scott Bixby is heading to the scene: you can keep up with him @scottbix. There are anti-Trump protests in Chicago, too, with reports that hundreds have gathered, chanting: \u201cTrump\u2019s not my president!\u201d An anti-Trump protest has been taking place in New York City. Protesters gathered in Union Square, with the intention to march to Trump Tower. Organised by the New York chapter of Socialist Alternative, the march has been promoted via an event page on Facebook, which says the rally is to help \u201cbuild a movement to fight racism, sexism, and Islamophobia\u201d. One attendee, a postgraduate student who wished to remain anonymous, said: The crowd was energetic, loud, and focused. Most people were in their 20s, but not exclusively \u2013 there were school kids and people in their 50s too. Chants included \u2018black lives matter\u2019, \u2018deport Donald Trump\u2019, \u2018fuck Donald Trump\u2019, \u2018no fascist USA\u2019, \u2018Trump, you\u2019re fired\u2019, \u2018trans rights are human rights\u2019, \u2018women\u2019s rights are human rights\u2019, and \u2018my body my choice\u2019. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell held a press conference this evening to congratulate president-elect Donald Trump. McConnell identified the appointment of a new supreme court justice and border security as key priorities for the party, but also said repealing Obamacare would be \u201chigh on the agenda.\u201d The surprise of Trump\u2019s win looked like leading to market meltdown across the world. But it didn\u2019t, thanks in part it seems to Trump\u2019s conciliatory speech, proving that investors hate uncertainty more than anything. The promise of a smooth handover of power, a united Congress, tax cuts and a huge infrastructure spending boost was enough to turn red screens green. Trump has already had words with a few world leaders, including Mexican president Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, who said he\u2019d had a \u201cfriendly and respectful conversation\u201d with his new neighbour. He didn\u2019t say if Mexico would pay for the wall \u2026 Sanders has just issued a statement on the presidential result: Donald Trump tapped into the anger of a declining middle class that is sick and tired of establishment economics, establishment politics and the establishment media. People are tired of working longer hours for lower wages, of seeing decent paying jobs go to China and other low-wage countries, of billionaires not paying any federal income taxes and of not being able to afford a college education for their kids \u2013 all while the rich become very much richer. To the degree that Mr Trump is serious about pursuing policies that improve the lives of working families in this country, I and other progressives are prepared to work with him. To the degree that he pursues racist, sexist, xenophobic and anti-environment policies, we will vigorously oppose him. What does the transition from an Obama presidency to a Trump presidency look like? The president-elect has the right to see the intelligence briefings Obama receives daily; as Associated Press reports: that includes information on US covert operations, information gleaned about world leaders and other data gathered by America\u2019s 17 intelligence agencies. Who\u2019s in Trump\u2019s transition team? It\u2019s chaired by Chris Christie; Mike Pence, RNC chairman Reince Priebus and Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner are also round the table. According to AP: The team is putting a premium on quickly filling key national security posts, according to people familiar with the conversations but not authorized to discuss them publicly. \u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s got to be pretty close held until the president-elect is ready to begin to announce appointments,\u201d said Bill Hagerty, Trump\u2019s director of presidential appointments, who declined to offer any details on a timeline for Trump\u2019s first personnel moves. A chief of staff is traditionally appointed in the initial weeks after an election. Haggerty said the transition from one administration to another \u201cin essence, is a $2tn takeover when you think about it\u201d. A small transition team has been meeting since early August to discuss legislative priorities and plans for taking over agencies. While Christie provided Trump with weekly updates, until now, the campaign and transition operations functioned as relatively distinct entities and in different cities Trump\u2019s campaign in New York and the transition team in Washington. An organizational chart for the transition team obtained by The Associated Press confirms that some familiar names are playing senior roles in the formation of a Trump administration. National security planning was being led by former Michigan Rep. Mike Rogers, who previously worked for the FBI. Joseph \u201cKeith\u201d Kellogg, a retired Army lieutenant general, was heading defense planning. For domestic issues, the Trump transition team was relying on the leadership of Ken Blackwell, a former Cincinnati mayor and Ohio secretary of state. The president will host his successor in the Oval Office tomorrow, it\u2019s confirmed: And the first and next-first ladies will also meet: If current projections hold, Hillary Clinton will soon become the second presidential nominee to win the popular vote yet lose the electoral college \u2013 and thus the White House \u2013 in the past five US presidential elections. Clinton, who gave a speech this morning conceding to her victorious Republican opponent Donald Trump, is poised to lose the electoral college tally by a decisive 74 votes (nearly 14% of the total available) while carrying a slim majority of the overall votes cast. As of Wednesday afternoon Clinton led by more than 200,000 votes, with 47.7% to Trump\u2019s 47.5%. It would be the fifth time in the nation\u2019s history that such a split has occurred and may be a boon to advocates of reform of the two-century-old system. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping that this will bring further attention when we start lobbying state legislatures next term,\u201d said John Koza, a professor and author who originated legislation to replace the system that is now on the books in 11 states and could eventually bring down the electoral college. The electoral college is a constitutional relic of a fundamentally different nation, one with 13 states and a potential electorate of 2.5 million citizens, slashed dramatically by restrictions that limited the franchise to white, land-owning Protestant men. A variety of arguments have been raised for its value, but typically it is understood by political science and history scholars as a constitutional firewall from certain kinds of potentially \u201cundemocratic\u201d election outcomes. Senator Tom Cotton, a possible secretary of defense pick, to CNN: Waterboarding isn\u2019t torture... Donald Trump is a pretty tough guy and he\u2019s ready to make those tough calls The New Hampshire Union-Leader reports that US Senator Kelly Ayotte has conceded her unfathomably close race for reelection to Democratic rival Maggie Hassan, giving the Republicans a likely 52-48 majority in the upper chamber of Congress. Polls and punditry predicted a Latino surge would clinch Hillary Clinton\u2019s election but now the question is whether Latinos helped put Donald Trump in the White House. Exit polls suggest 29% voted for the Republican \u2013 a higher margin than Mitt Romney won in 2012 and perhaps enough to have tipped the scales in battleground states. That possibility sent analysts scrambling on Wednesday to plumb the numbers and ponder the psyche of an ethnic minority which Trump was deemed to have insulted and provoked. CNN\u2019s exit poll found that 65% of Latinos voted for Clinton while 29% cast their votes for Trump. In 2012 Barack Obama won 71% of the Latino vote and Romney won 27%. The number crunching site FiveThirtyEight said this may have tilted Florida\u2019s 29 electoral college votes into the column of a candidate who called Mexican immigrants \u201crapists\u201d and vowed to deport millions of undocumented people. \u201cTrump\u2019s margin among Latino voters in Florida, though thinner than it has been for Republican candidates in past races, likely helped him win that critical state.\u201d However Latino Decisions, a leader in Latino political opinion research, disputes CNN\u2019s exit poll and thinks a Latino surge did in fact happen. The firm\u2019s analysis of actual voting results in 12 states suggested Latinos voted in record numbers and gave Clinton a thumping majority. \u201cWe think it was 79% for Clinton and 18% for Trump,\u201d Matt Barreto, the firm\u2019s co-founder, told the Guardian. \u201cWe think there\u2019s a 0% chance that Trump did better than Romney in 2012. His negative numbers were through the roof. It was very strong for Clinton and turnout was higher.\u201d These results, if confirmed, would broadly match pre-election polls by Latino Decisions, NBC, Univision, Telemundo and the Washington Post. Austin, Texas, is the site of the latest anti-Trump protest: The only precinct in all of Manhattan to vote for Donald Trump is in Times Square: Russian president Vladimir Putin called for a new era of \u201cfully fledged relations\u201d between his country and the US yesterday after a surprise victory which was applauded in the Russian parliament and prompted speculation that US-imposed sanctions could be lifted. After an election campaign in which Russia was openly accused of interfering in favour of Donald Trump, Putin congratulated the president-elect on his victory and said Russia was ready to work for better ties. \u201cWe understand that it will not be an easy path given the current state of degradation in the relations,\u201d he said, speaking in the Kremlin. \u201cAnd as I have repeatedly said, it\u2019s not our fault that Russian-American relations are in such a poor state. But Russia wants and is ready to restore fully fledged relations with the United States.\u201d Earlier, Putin became one of the first world leaders to congratulate Trump, sending him a telegram expressing hope for an era of positive ties. Many Russian politicians welcomed the news, both because Trump has spoken of his admiration for Putin and because he represents a blow against the US \u201cestablishment\u201d. Back in August, I recorded a pilot for a TV show back in the UK. Here\u2019s what I had to say about what would happen in the 2016 presidential election: Unsurprisingly, I still believe the polls are hugely inaccurate. But I\u2019d add a few caveats to what I said in August about the poorest voters. Exit polls (which are still polling data - therefore suffer from plenty of inaccuracy of their own) suggest that American voters with a household income under $30,000, and those with an income $30,000 - $49,999 actually chose Hillary Clinton. But the data isn\u2019t broken down by race and income, so it\u2019s still possible that the poorest white voters didn\u2019t tell pollsters that they planned on voting for Trump. The Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion Super Pac that heavily campaigned on behalf of president-elect Donald Trump, has declared victory with Trump\u2019s election to the presidency and the maintenance of a solid Republican majority in the US Senate. \u201cBoth the presidential race and the control of the Senate came down to tens of thousands of votes in Florida, Ohio, and North Carolina,\u201d said Susan B. Anthony List president Marjorie Dannenfelser, who lauded the groups outreach to 1.6 million anti-abortion. \u201cPersuadable Democratic and Hispanic voters in these three states sealed victory both for Donald Trump and the pro-life Senate candidates,\u201d Dannenfelser said. \u201cThis is an historic moment for the pro-life movement. There are four critical pro-life goals now within our reach: end painful late-term abortions, codify the Hyde Amendment, defund Planned Parenthood, and appoint pro-life Supreme Court Justices.\u201d Australia has woken up to president-elect Donald Trump: Etch-a-Sketch? Trump has removed his campaign news releases from his web site: Here\u2019s Thursday\u2019s Lib\u00e9ration cover: Last night, seated between my 68-year-old mother and six-year-old daughter, I expected to watch the first woman get elected president of the United States. We bought champagne and cake, and promised Layla that she could stay up as late as she wanted to watch. My daughter fell asleep on the couch, still wearing a shirt emblazoned with the word \u201cfeminist\u201d and an \u201cI voted\u201d sticker. This morning, I\u2019ll have to tell Layla that Hillary Clinton lost, that a woman won\u2019t be president. Even more difficult, I\u2019ll have to tell her that Donald Trump won. The man she knows as a bully who says terrible things about women, people with disabilities and immigrants \u2013 the man who brags about hurting people and separating families \u2013 will lead her nation. Last night my heart broke for my country, this morning it breaks for her. She woke up in a changed America today \u2013 one where a liar and a racist, a xenophobe and a serial harasser of women, will lead us. She woke up in a place that flatly rejected progress, a country where a man can admit to sexually assaulting women and win millions of votes because, not in spite, of it. I have always been worried about the things I will pass down to my daughter; the burdens she inherits simply by living in a sexist world are the things I fear the most. How will I explain to her about how many women have been hurt, badly, because of the sexism that surrounds them? How I will I keep her from being afraid that her fate to suffer the same is inevitable? Read further: The AP hasn\u2019t called the New Hampshire senate race yet, but it appears that Republican incumbent Kelly Ayotte may have lost her seat. That\u2019s according to a first count concluding with a very thin margin, with a recount probable. Actually, the three Republican senate candidates who lost were in states where Trump lost \u2013 Illinois, Nevada and New Hampshire, if Ayotte\u2019s loss holds. Republican candidates won in states Trump won: Wisconsin, Indiana, North Carolina, Missouri, Florida, Arizona (if Trump\u2019s win holds...). By Adam Gopnik in the New Yorker: Someone asked me this morning to say something about talking to kids in this time of crisis. Indeed, Van Jones, speaking last night on CNN, as our own Brexitish disaster was unfolding, spoke passionately about the perils of this Wednesday morning\u2019s breakfast: What do you say to kids when a man whom they have been (rightly) brought up to regard as a monstrous figure is suddenly the figure, the President we have? I have been unstinting in my own view of the perils of Trumpism, and will remain so. But I also believe that the comings and goings of politics and political actions in our lives must not be allowed to dominate our daily existence\u2014and that if we struggle to emphasize to our children the necessities of community, ongoing life, daily pleasures, and shared enterprises, although we may not defeat the ogres of history, we can hope to remain who we are in their face. Read further. Deep breath: National security Trump now has control over the vast US security apparatus, with all its power to kill, surveil and influence. Trump, whose command of policy specifics is minimal, has made no secret of his inclination to unleash it. Now he faces early tests of how far he will go. Barack Obama will leave office with Guant\u00e1namo Bay still in operation as a detention facility. Trump\u2019s election ensures the infamous wartime prison escapes closure, but it will probably cross a constitutional Rubicon. The president-elect has pledged to increase the Guant\u00e1namo population, a reversal of Obama\u2019s approach, \u201cwith some bad dudes\u201d. Among those \u201cbad dudes\u201d, Trump told the Miami Herald, could be American citizens. His pledge to bring back \u201cworse than waterboarding\u201d threatens to undo the shaky coalition against torture, especially in a GOP Congress, of the late Bush and Obama administrations. The move would be illegal if Trump meant to try Americans in military commissions, and almost sure to be found unconstitutional if Trump meant holding Americans in indefinite detention. In the same interview, Trump also signaled a departure from both Obama and George W Bush in expressing opposition to using the criminal justice system for terrorism cases. [...] Video : Paul Ryan hails Trump\u2019s \u2018incredible political feat\u2019 Clever, Populist and Incapable I personally believe that Donald Trump was clever, in the sense of seizing the opportunity he was provided with. He understood the fears and worries of, apparently, many American people and structured his pre-election arguments accordingly. Yet, I also believe that he is a populist. In other words, he said things just for the sake of being elected. No, he will not build a wall; he will not deport illegal immigrants and he will not do a number of things he promised to do, because he is incapable of doing them. He wanted to draw attention, but I doubt that he will be able to carry the burden of being the US President and he will undoubtedly let his supporters down in the next few months. -DSkrimizeas This is Not Good So how are we going to Make American Great Again? Trump is going to unite the country and rebuild the working class? Not for a second. Divide and conquer has been his method, and now that he has secured the win, the gloves are really going to come off. He\u2019s going to take down corrupt Washington, elites, and the rigged system? No fucking way. He\u2019s going to be the system, reap all the benefits he can for himself, and indulge in his power. Get ready for change, but not the sort that is going to help you, your family, or the nation. The insanity has just begun. -bw9009 The fear &amp; resentment are real From my perspective as a man of Hispanic/Mexican descent, I feel angry that Trump\u2019s first remarks (re: rapists, murderers, etc.) were not met by any true reprimands. It has only reinforced in my mind what I have seen just below the surface of society, that in an area of the world where we have existed for about 500 years, we have been, and are still seen as second-class citizens. Trump\u2019s victory only crystallizes what many of us have known, but the majority, white culture simply pretended that we were all equal when it has never been about that. It has only ever been the ability to keep and not redistribute wealth as well as solidifying our social and legal structures that continually discriminate against minorities and communities of color. -William Mosqueda It\u2019s not the fact that it\u2019s him. It\u2019s that people voted for him. What made me saddest watching the election results play out was not so much Donald Trump being elected as what his election represents. It represents an America, one of the most powerful states in the world, that is willing to support open racism, open sexism, open Islamophobia. It\u2019s disquieting and has made me a little bit more daunted at the prospect of entering into an adult world governed by such values. However, as disheartening as this election is, I think of the words of Edmund Burke: -\u201dThe only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.\u201d -sineadkeeley What do you say to undocumented immigrants? McConnell: \u201cI\u2019m not going to discuss the immigration issue today. We\u2019ll be discussing it internally... in the coming months.\u201d McConnell is asked about Clinton apparently winning the popular vote. \u201cThe American people understand that if you get 270 electoral votes that means you\u2019re president,\u201d he says. \u201cThe election is over. We know who won. And we\u2019re going to move on from there, and do the best we can for the American people.\u201d McConnell on working with likely minority leader Chuck Schumer: \u201cI respect him, I think he\u2019s very smart, and I think we\u2019ll be fine.\u201d On Pence: \u201cWe all really like Mike Pence.. everybody likes him. We all thought it was a great choice that president-elect Trump made in picking him.\u201d McConnell mentions how vice president Dick Cheney always came to policy lunches, and that he hopes Pence will do that, \u201ckind of be our liaison\u201d to the White House. \u201cI think it\u2019s always a mistake to misread your mandate,\u201d McConnell says... \u201cAnd so, I don\u2019t think we should act as if we\u2019re going to be in the majority forever. \u201cI think what the American people are looking for is results. \u201cWe are going to be looking for bipartisan support, and I think overreaching after the election is a mistake.\u201d McConnell says \u201cI don\u2019t think so\u201d when asked if he\u2019ll revisit a ban on earmarks. Does McConnell support Nato withdrawal? \u201cI want to look forward,\u201d McConnell says. Then he says that Nato is as important as ever, Article 5 is important and \u201cI want the Russians to understand that fully.\u201d McConnell says Obamacare \u201cis a pretty high item on the agenda, as you know. I would be shocked if we didn\u2019t move forward to make good on our promise to the American people.\u201d That promise, ICYMI, is to repeal the Affordable Care and Patient Protection Act. (Or maybe just the unpopular bits.) Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell is speaking. \u201cThe American people have spoken and president Trump will send us a nominee I assume early next year.\u201d McConnell says \u201cthe new president will fill the vacancy and i expect it to be handled in the way these court appointments are typically handled and I would not anticipate any particular strategies...\u201d on the part of Democrats. Legislative priorities? Tax reform \u201cis really important,\u201d McConnell says. \u201cThe current president was not interested in making it revenue-neutral for the government... the goal ought to be when revenue is produced by the elimination of preferences, use that to buy down the rates.\u201d McConnell says he\u2019d like to see comprehensive tax reform, including corporate tax reform. \u201cThere were plenty of Democrats onboard\u201d in the eighties, he says. McConnell is asked about his own legacy. \u201cWe haven\u2019t even started the next Congress yet. There\u2019ll be plenty of time to talk legacies later.\u201d On funding the government, which comes up next month, during the lame duck session. McConnell says that and a medical measures bill are on the immediate agenda, he\u2019s spoken about that with Obama. McConnell is asked about his past expressions of concerns about Trump\u2019s remarks about Mexicans. McConnell says let\u2019s \u201cLook forward and not backward. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be talking to the president about his agenda. I think border security is important.. I want to try to achieve border security in whatever way is most effective.\u201d Reading. The New Yorker\u2019s David Remnick: The election of Donald Trump to the Presidency is nothing less than a tragedy for the American republic, a tragedy for the Constitution, and a triumph for the forces, at home and abroad, of nativism, authoritarianism, misogyny, and racism. Trump\u2019s shocking victory, his ascension to the Presidency, is a sickening event in the history of the United States and liberal democracy. On January 20, 2017, we will bid farewell to the first African-American President\u2014a man of integrity, dignity, and generous spirit\u2014and witness the inauguration of a con who did little to spurn endorsement by forces of xenophobia and white supremacy. It is impossible to react to this moment with anything less than revulsion and profound anxiety. [...] It is all a dismal picture. Late last night, as the results were coming in from the last states, a friend called me full of sadness, full of anxiety about conflict, about war. Why not leave the country? But despair is no answer. To combat authoritarianism, to call out lies, to struggle honorably and fiercely in the name of American ideals\u2014that is what is left to do. That is all there is to do. Wheeling a case of wine and a 12-pack of beer out of the Total Wine and Spirits liquor superstore in Natick, Massachusetts, Maureen ( an older woman who declined to give her last name) called it \u201ca sad day.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re in charge of everything now,\u201d she said of Republicans with a heavy Boston accent as she loaded her purchases into her Subaru SUV. \u201cThe House, the Senate, the Supreme Court justices. They never let Obama pass a thing and now it\u2019s theirs.\u201d Of Trump, she said, \u201cHe\u2019s like a little spoiled brat, things don\u2019t go his way, he\u2019s nasty to everyone.\u201d \u201cI had some friends who were for him and I couldn\u2019t understand it, the way he talks about people\u201d she added. Inside the store, a staff member recognized a regular customer. \u201cBack already?\u201d he called out cheerfully. \u201cSaw the results and had to come back for more?\u201d The White House press secretary goes where the president and Clinton dared not, mentioning Clinton\u2019s lead in the popular vote: Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson has released a statement with running mate Bill Weld, who came out in the final days of the election and pleaded with people to whatever they did not vote for Trump: \u201cIt is a rare privilege to play a part in shaping the future of a great nation. By offering Americans an honorable, principled choice in this election, and being joined by thousands of supporters and volunteers to make a credible third party ticket part of the national conversation, we took significant steps toward reshaping the political landscape. For that, I am both proud and grateful. [...] \u201cToday is a day to wish the President-elect our best wishes, and a sincere hope that, together, we can get about the business of addressing the challenges this great nation faces.\u201d Iowa representative Steve King, who supported Trump early and often, tips his hat to newly reelected Iowa senator Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the judiciary committee who declined to hold hearings on Barack Obama\u2019s supreme court nominee, Merrick Garland. Trump will now nominate a supreme court justice whom the Republican-controlled senate may confirm. He may get to nominate more than one... if Republicans can keep the senate through the midterms... The question is, what does \u201csaving the Constitution\u201d mean, for those now with their hands on the levers of power? Does the media posture on Trump change now? Here\u2019s an early entry from the world of celeb media: Shocked but still believe in it I\u2019m living in the Middle East, Iraqi Kurdistan. I was really shocked by the news and my mind can barely believe in this, but I have to convince myself with the result. Mr.Trump, you won the election then I hope you do the change you are planning to do. Mr.Trump you have accused Obama and Clinton by bringing ISIS to excite then put you plan you an action and let us see what you can do. Stand with Peace, Love, Justice and respect :) -Haseeb Ah-Hassan We need to embrace democracy. I was backing Hillary Clinton to win as I felt she was the most qualified candidate for the Presidency that anyone has ever seen. However, alike the Brexit vote, I was sceptical about the UK leaving Europe and I have since embraced this and outlined the optimism in the mandate. I am now going to try and embrace Donald Trump\u2019s win of the election and see the advantages of his role in the White House. After all, the UK and US are democratic countries and the people have spoken, therefore we should embrace this and look to the future. Even if we are becoming an anti-establishment society, democracy shows that people want change. Watching President Trump (I literally shudder while typing this..) give his acceptance speech has made me despair for my future, my children\u2019s future and my children\u2019s future. -Lewis Ormston Think I\u2019m being dramatic? Think again... His behavior during the campaign has now legitimized what and how future generations of young men will be taught on how to treat women, how women will be forever seen as second class to men and finally how anyone who is not the whitest of white can ever truly be hold a position of power in any role. This win is a middle finger to a black man being president and a woman daring to stand up and ask to be considered equal to a man. -Petal23 If only Bernie... I believe that apart from lack of trust issues Trump won because those with the most to lose did not make the effort to vote. If only Bernie had begun his campaign two months earlier. If only...If only..If only..... -fourthplinth This is a disaster Millions of Americans rose up to cast a vote for bigotry, misogyny, and dumb, cruel-hearted ignorance. This is a disaster. -NickNormal Overt post-Brexit-style racism, without ever having been absent in the United States, now more overt, as in this scene: Has the reality settled in yet? Arizona senator Jeff Flake was one of Trump\u2019s most vocal Republican detractors: In an unexpected win, Donald Trump rode the wave of anti-establishment sentiment to become the next president-elect of the US. If you\u2019re Hispanic we\u2019d like to hear from you: what do you make of the results? How are you feeling? Share your reactions with us by filling in the form below. We\u2019ll feature a selection of responses in our live coverage. Get in touch here: Barack Obama has just suffered a devastating blow to his legacy. He failed to hand off the White House to a member of his party, despite his personal popularity. His namesake health care legislation is on the chopping block. Same with his actions on emissions caps, other environmental regulations, immigration reform and more... With a Republican-controlled Congress and White House, no piece of Obama\u2019s legislative or executive legacy would seem to be safe. So that was a gracious speech, too, under the circumstances. Obama: \u201cA lot of our fellow Americans are exulted today. A lot are less so. But that\u2019s the nature of campaigns, that\u2019s the nature of democracy. \u201cTo the young people who got into politics for the first time and may be discouraged by the results, I want you to know, you have to stay encouraged... don\u2019t get cynical. Fighting for what is right is important.. \u201cI\u2019ve lost elections before. Joe hasn\u2019t.. [Biden lost the 2008 primary to Obama] Biden: \u201cyou beat me badly.\u201d Obama: \u201cwe lick our wounds, we brush ourselves off, we get back in the arena... we move forward.. that presumption of good faith is essential to a vibrant... democracy.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s how we have come this far... I\u2019m confident that this incredible journey that we\u2019re on will go on.\u201d Obama says he is going to do everything he can to hand off smoothly to Trump. It\u2019s a relay race, he says. \u201cUltimately, we\u2019re all on the same team,\u201d he says. He\u2019s done. Here\u2019s Obama. With the vice president. \u201cYesterday, before votes were tallied, I shot a video... in which I said to the American people.. the sun would come up in the morning and that is one bit of prognosticating that actually came true. \u201cI know everybody had a long night. I did as well.\u201d Obama said he spoke with \u201cpresident-elect Trump\u201d at 3.30am. \u201cIt is no secret that the president-elect and I have some pretty significant differences. But remember that eight years ago, President Bush and I had some pretty significant differences.. \u201cThe presidency and vice presidency is bigger than any of us. \u201cWe are now all rooting for his success in uniting and leading this country. The peaceful transfer of power is one of the hallmarks of our democracy.\u201d On Clinton: \u201cI could not be prouder of her... I am proud of her. A lot of Americans look up to her... Her candidacy and nomination was historic.. \u201cEverybody is sad when their side loses their election. But the day after, we have to remember that we\u2019re actually all on the same team.... we\u2019re patriots first. \u201cThat\u2019s what I heard when I spoke to [Trump] directly, and I was heartened by that. That\u2019s what our country needs. ... I hope that he maintains that spirit throughout this transition and I certainly hope that\u2019s how his presidency has a chance to begin.\u201d A two-minute warning has been issued. Trump wins Alaska, the AP says. 279-228 Trump. He tops 300 if he keeps ahold of Arizona and Michigan. Next up: president Barack Obama. Here\u2019s a live stream: Trump spokesman Jason Miller: \u201cLaura and I wish the President-elect, Melania, and the entire Trump family all our very best...\u201d Good point here. Clinton didn\u2019t mention she\u2019s ahead... in the popular vote. House minority leader Nancy Pelosi says she\u2019s ready to work on an infrastructure spending bill, too: Clinton says she is \u201cincredibly honored and grateful to have had this chance.\u201d \u201cMay god bless you and may god bless the United States of America.\u201d She hugs everyone onstage and walks off. There goes Clinton. Clinton: \u201cAnd to all the women.. who put their faith in this campaign and me... I want you to know that nothing has made me prouder than to be your champion.\u201d \u201cI know we have still not shattered that highest and hardest glass ceiling, but I know someday someone will, and hopefully sooner than we might think right now. \u201cAnd to all the little girls who are watching this, never doubt that you are valuable, powerful, and deserving of every opportunity in the world and every chance to pursue your own dreams.\u201d Clinton thanks Kaine and Holton and says she\u2019s comforted to know Kaine is going back to the senate. \u201cTo Barack and Michelle Obama. Our country owes you an enormous debt of gratitude. We thank you for your graceful determined leadership that has meant so much... \u201cAnd to Bill and Chelsea, Mark Charlotte Aidan.. my love for you means more than I can ever express. You criss-crossed this country on my behalf and lifted me up when I needed it most. She thanks the \u201ctalent and dedicated\u201d staff. Any names? \u201cYou poured your hearts into this campaign... you were the best campaign that anybody could have ever expected or wanted. \u201cAnd to the millions of volunteers, community leaders, activists and union organizers...I want everybody coming out... and make sure your voices are heard going forward. She thanks donors. She thanks \u201cthe young people in particular.\u201d And tells them she\u2019s had \u201csuccesses and setbacks,\u201d \u201cSometimes really painful.\u201d \u201cYou will have successes and setbacks too. This loss hurts. But please never stop believing that fighting for what\u2019s right is worth it.\u201d Clinton says that in addition to respecting the election \u201cwe must defend\u201d the values of non-discrimination and the rule of law and equality before the law. That\u2019s applauded. She calls on supporters to advance the values \u201cwe hold most dear.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve spent a year-and-a-half bringing together millions of people... \u201cWe believe the American dream is big enough for everyone.\u201d She says men, women, LGBT, people with disabilites - \u201cfor everyone.\u201d \u201cOur responsibility as citizens is to continue to do our part to build that better stronger fairer America that we all seek.\u201d The crowd is clapping too much for Clinton to begin. \u201cThank you all very much,\u201d she says. They clap and clap and clap. \u201cThank you, thank you. And I love you all, too.\u201d \u201cLast night I congratulated Donald Trump and offered to work with him on behalf of our country. I hope that he will be a president for all of our country... \u201cI\u2019m sorry that we did not win this election for the values we all share... \u201cYou represent the best of America, and being your candidate has been one of the greatest honors of my life. I know how disappointed you feel, because I feel it too.... This is painful, and it will be for a long time. But I want you to remember this. Our campaign was never about one person... it was about building a country that we love... We have seen that our country was more deeply divided than we ever thought... We must accept this result... Donald Trump is going to be our president... we owe him an open mind and a chance to lead. Here comes Clinton. She steps to the stage smiling. Chelsea and husband Mark and Bill Clinton with her. \u201cThank you,\u201d she begins, to applause. You can watch the Clinton/Kaine live stream atop the blog there. Kaine is recounting a Biblical parable. He says that Clinton\u2019s team is defined by its loyalty which is inspiring. \u201cAnd finally I\u2019m proud of Hillary because she loves this country. Nobody had to wonder of Hillary Clinton whether she would accept the outcome of an election.\u201d That\u2019s a dig at Trump, not by name, a damnation by comparison. \u201cI want to thank Hillary for asking me and Anne if we would join this wild ride.\u201d Kaine quotes Faulkner. \u201cThey kilt us, but they ain\u2019t whupped us yet.\u201d Tim Kaine and wife Anne Holton take the stage at the New Yorker ballroom. Kaine says \u201cI\u2019m proud of Hillary Clinton because she has been and is a great history-maker.\u201d Huma Abedin and other aides have entered the room at the New Yorker hotel. They\u2019re applauded. Prime Minister Theresa May gave a statement after Donald Trump was elected the next President of the United States. Prime Minister Theresa May said: \u201cI would like to congratulate Donald Trump on being elected the next President of the United States, following a hard-fought campaign. \u201cBritain and the United States have an enduring and special relationship based on the values of freedom, democracy and enterprise. \u201cWe are, and will remain, strong and close partners on trade, security and defence. \u201cI look forward to working with President-elect Donald Trump, building on these ties to ensure the security and prosperity of our nations in the years ahead.\u201d Ryan is done. He struck an upbeat tone, praising Trump for delivering a unified Republican government, admiring Trump\u2019s political feat, identifying an opportunity \u201cto go big and to go bold\u201d with Republican legislative priorities and declaring \u201cthis is good for our country.\u201d Ryan: \u201cone of the biggest for this race is the constitution itself... we believe in the constitution. We have an agenda to get people back to work. We want the federal government to respect the states. This is exciting. \u201cHe set the right tone with his speech, which is to be magnanimous, to be presidential and bring people together.\u201d Ryan says \u201cDonald and I have had fantastic conversations.\u201d He\u2019s also spoken with his good friend Mike Pence. \u201cHow do we make sure that when his hand comes off the Bible, when he\u2019s sworn in as president, that we are hitting the ground running? \u201cThe opportunity is now here, and the opportunity is to go big and go bold,\u201d Ryan says. \u201cWhat I see here is great potential... the opportunity to get back to work for the American people. Donald Trump pulled off an amazing political feat.\u201d Ryan is asked about Trump\u2019s remarks about women and Latinos. Ryan says he tells Wisconsinites, think of all that a united Republican government can do. Ryan praises Trump for delivering Wisconsin for the first time since 1984. Ryan is asked about Obamacare. Ryan says it\u2019s not popular and is \u201ccollapsing under its own weight.\u201d \u201cNow we have president Trump coming who is asking us to fix this... there are so many things I\u2019m excited about... there is relief coming. This is good for our country. This means we can list the repressive weight of the regulatory state... think of the ... judges. This is very exciting. \u201c \u201cI think our relationship\u2019s fine, I\u2019ve spoken with Donald twice in the last 18 hours. I think we\u2019re going to hit the ground running... I think what Donald Trump just pulled off is an enormous political feat... he just earned a mandate. And we now just had a unified Republican government. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m excited about where we are. \u201cWe had great conversations about how we\u2019ll work together.\u201d Here\u2019s Paul Ryan, right on time: Tim Kaine\u2019s is certainly a hard mood to dampen, isn\u2019t it... Hillary Clinton wins Minnesota, the Associated Press projects. A tight 1.4-point win. The electoral tally climbs to Trump 276 Clinton 228. The party doesn\u2019t decide ... and don\u2019t trust the polls. Basically, throw all the old metrics out the window. State-level ground games run by the campaign (not the national party), too \u2013 those don\u2019t matter anymore, either. Apparently. Out with the old, in with the new: Here\u2019s video of Clinton\u2019s motorcade carrying her toward her speech: Trump will begin receiving full presidential briefings today, CNN reports. Tim Kaine arrives at the New Yorker hotel. Last night was the first election the former mayor and governor and current senator had ever lost. He\u2019s now 8-1. Clinton is expected to speak soon. We\u2019ve just added a live video stream to the top of the blog and here it is for good measure: Clinton\u2019s motorcade is now moving out of the Peninsula, headed for the New Yorker hotel where she will speak. It\u2019s a quiet morning at Trump Tower. In fact the media pool representative there has just described himself as \u201cthe only person sitting on the metal benches just across from the elevator bay... NYPD and Secret Service has completely locked down the area, no one is milling about in the lobby, the Starbucks on the second floor is closed.\u201d Trump is in the tower, a spokesperson says. Nothing further at this time. Hillary Clinton has yet to leave her hotel for her speech scheduled to begin 20 minutes ago, originally scheduled to begin 80 minutes ago. The world is still waiting to hear and see Clinton for the first time since her loss. The popular vote count isn\u2019t totally settled. But Trump trails both Obama and Romney from the 2012 election \u2013 and Clinton from this election: Those popular vote totals are why this 2012 tweet is so widely shared today: The Bush dynasty has been beaten... for now. George P, the Texas land commissioner, is Jeb\u2019s oldest son. Neither George W Bush nor Laura Bush cast a ballot in the presidential election, according to a spokesperson. George HW Bush was quoted earlier this year as saying he would vote for Clint. Here\u2019s Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway talking this morning about whether Trump still thinks the election was rigged. She spouts spokespeak, \u201che certainly would say the system is rigged... when he said the system was rigged.. he couldn\u2019t believe he wasn\u2019t winning.\u201d Why does this quotidian tweet have hundreds of likes and retweets? The results continue to trickle in... the AP calls Nebraska\u2019s second congressional district for the challenger, a Republican, who ends the brief Washington career of Brad Ashford, the Democratic incumbent. The Republican romp continues. It\u2019s a full lineup: A reminder that we\u2019re due to hear from House speaker Paul Ryan at around 11.15pm \u2013 potentially directly after Clinton\u2019s address. German chancellor Angela Merkel has offered \u201ccooperation\u201d to \u201cthe next president of the United States,\u201d emphasizing shared values including \u201cthe dignity of man, independent of origin, skin color, religion, gender, sexual orientation or political views\u201d: Here\u2019s Mitt Romney, the 2012 nominee, who by the current count garnered a two million more popular votes in that election than Trump got last night - but lost. Romney did. The polls were wrong. And because we are obsessed with predicting opinions rather than listening to them, we didn\u2019t see it coming. So, the world woke up believing that Republican candidate Donald Trump had a 15% chance of winning based on polling predictions \u2013 roughly the same chance of rolling a total of six if you have two dice. Despite those odds, the next US president will be Donald Trump. I have a few ideas about what went wrong. In the four years I\u2019ve spent as a data journalist, I\u2019ve been concerned by how much faith the public has placed in polling. Just like you\u2019d check the weather before getting dressed, many people checked presidential polling numbers before heading out to vote. That\u2019s understandable. Politics can feel as unpredictable as the weather, and who wouldn\u2019t want to eliminate uncertainty? The world is a scary and confusing place right now. But those are two very different kinds of forecasts. One is based on natural science, the other on social science. People are different to planets \u2013 they can change their minds, they can decide to not share their opinions or they can flat out lie. And that\u2019s before you even get to some of the statistical issues that make polling inaccurate. That\u2019s not new information. Polling analysts like me knew the numbers were inaccurate before Brexit happened. Despite that, the polling predictions kept coming. Why? Definitely read further: The Clinton camera is trying to get an eye on her leaving the Peninsula hotel for the New Yorker hotel\u2019s grand ballroom, where she\u2019s scheduled to speak. No sighting yet. Margaret Sullivan, media commentator at the Washington Post, wrote this morning about how the media failed American voters by completely misunderstanding the election - and taking Trump\u2019s criticisms personally. To put it bluntly, the media missed the story. In the end, a huge number of American voters wanted something different. And although these voters shouted and screamed it, most journalists just weren\u2019t listening. They didn\u2019t get it. They didn\u2019t get that the huge, enthusiastic crowds at Donald Trump\u2019s rallies would really translate into that many votes. They couldn\u2019t believe that the America they knew could embrace someone who mocked a disabled man, bragged about sexually assaulting women, and spouted misogyny, racism and anti-Semitism. She highlights something that Trump backer, billionaire Peter Thiel, pointed out last week. \u201cThe media is always taking Trump literally. It never takes him seriously, but it always takes him literally,\u201d Thiel said. Journalists wanted to know exactly how he would deport that many undocumented immigrants, or exactly how Trump would rid the world of ISIS. We wanted details. But a lot of voters think the opposite way: They take Trump seriously but not literally. They realize, Thiel said, that Trump doesn\u2019t really plan to build a wall. \u201cWhat they hear is, \u2018We\u2019re going to have a saner, more sensible immigration policy.\u2019 \u201d After a controversial campaign that included contentious remarks about Muslims, and other ethnic minorities, readers share their reaction to Trump\u2019s win. Anonymous: \u201cI feel extremely disappointed that America elected an outright racist man as President. \u201cThis country will not come together but will be even be more divided. And to the people who say that President Obama was the worst President in history, should really go and check their facts. \u201cAnd for the people who voted for Trump, don\u2019t believe he is going to do anything for you. You are foolish and you will see. Give it sometime. Yes, we all want change. But, not all change is good change. \u201cDonald Trump will take away every right that was fought for this country. Say goodbye to womens\u2019 right to choose, say goodbye to equality, and say goodbye to democracy. What\u2019s the purpose of the Statue of Liberty, when all your liberties will be taken away? America has ushered in a new era of hate, inequality, and injustices. Sara: \u201cAs a queer Jewish woman it\u2019s devastating to feel that a majority of my nation does not support my rights - let alone the rights of others which I work to support and uphold and believe in with the core of my being. \u201cBut after the initial shock and depression has sunk in, I am channeling my emotions as fuel. This is an opportunity to step up, become much more active, and work towards organizing collective action to change the political status quo.\u201d Matanda Mondoa: \u201cI think many of us thought Hillary Clinton got the election on solid ground. But when the results showed otherwise, things suddenly turned too real. I\u2019m worried for my friends and family, the immigrant and undocumented communities, LGBT community, and Muslim &amp; Arab American communities. \u201cWhile Democrats still have a hold in my home state, the fact that it\u2019s the contrary everywhere else will have me look out for people\u2019s safety &amp; peace of mind.\u201d This is a weirdly paparazzi-style video, but it\u2019s monitoring Hillary Clinton as she leaves her Manhattan hotel this morning to give a speech to supporters. So far just a waiting car is visible. Clinton\u2019s 10:30am speech will be less a concession to Trump and more a thank you to supporters, says CNN\u2019s Dan Merica. Opening bell of the New York Stock Exchange has just been rung, now it\u2019s eyes on the market to see how it will react to the election of Trump as president. Asian markets and the US dollar dropped yesterday following initial news of his presidency. What will happen to world climate change agreements in light of the election of Donald Trump? As John Vidal reports: Just days after the historic Paris agreement officially came into force, climate denier Donald Trump\u2019s victory has thrown the global deal into uncertainty and raised fears that the US will reverse the ambitious environmental course charted under Barack Obama. International environmental groups meeting at the UN climate talks in Morocco said it would be a catastrophe if Trump acted on his pledge to withdraw the US from the deal, which took 20 years to negotiate, and to increase federal spending on oil, gas and coal. They urged the president-elect, as the leader of the second greatest greenhouse gas emitter, to act in the interests of all the world. \u201cThe new president must protect the people he serves from climate chaos. No personal belief or political affiliation can change the stark truth that every new oil well and pipeline pushes us all closer to catastrophe. The administration has moral and legal obligations to meet international commitments,\u201d said May Boeve, head of climate campaign group 350.org. Read the rest here. Interesting insight from Politico\u2019s Annie Karni, a member of the Clinton campaign\u2019s traveling press: Polls show it was white working class voters who won the election for Trump. From the Associated Press: Cuba has announced the launch of five days of nationwide military exercises to prepare troops to confront what the government calls \u201ca range of enemy actions\u201d. The government did not link the exercises to Donald Trump\u2019s US presidential victory but the announcement of maneuvers and tactical exercises across the country came nearly simultaneously with Trump\u2019s surprise win. It is the seventh time Cuba has held what it calls the \u201cBastion Strategic Exercise\u201d, often in response to points of high tension with the United States. The first exercise was launched in 1980 after the election of Ronald Reagan as US president, according to an official history. Trump has promised to reverse Barack Obama\u2019s re-establishment of diplomatic relations with Cuba and the ongoing normalization of the relationship between the two countries. An announcement by Cuba\u2019s Revolutionary Armed Forces in red ink across the top of the front page of the country\u2019s main newspaper said the army, interior ministry and other forces would be conducting maneuvers and different types of tactical exercises from 16 to 20 November.

The US accounted for 60% of Canada\u2019s global trade in 2014, a relationship underpinned by Nafta. Trump, who has described the agreement as \u201cthe worst trade deal in history\u201d, has vowed to renegotiate the terms and would move to withdraw the US from the deal if Canada and Mexico refuse. According to the Canadian government, nearly 400,000 people a day cross the shared border between Canada and the US. Below is the statement in full: *** \u201cOn behalf of the Government of Canada, I would like to congratulate Donald J. Trump on his election as the next President of the United States. \u201cCanada has no closer friend, partner, and ally than the United States. We look forward to working very closely with President-elect Trump, his administration, and with the United States Congress in the years ahead, including on issues such as trade, investment, and international peace and security. \u201cThe relationship between our two countries serves as a model for the world. Our shared values, deep cultural ties, and strong integrated economies will continue to provide the basis for advancing our strong and prosperous partnership.\u201d A relevant message from Pope Francis this morning: Hillary Clinton\u2019s speech has been pushed back to 10:30am ET this morning (doors will open at 9:30am). Meanwhile, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wisconsin), who has never been a strong Donald Trump supporter, will speak in a \u201cpost election press briefing\u201d this morning at 11:15am ET. Mexican president Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, who met with Donald Trump during the presidential election in September, tweeted his congratulations to the United States - not Donald Trump - this morning. \u201cI congratulate the USA on its electoral process and I reiterate to Donald Trump our willingness to work together in support of bilateral relations,\u201d said Pe\u00f1a Nieto. \u201cMexico and the USA are friends, partners and allies that must continue collaborating for the competitiveness and the development of North America,\u201d said Pe\u00f1a Nieto. \u201cI trust that Mexico and the United States continue to strengthen their bonds of cooperation and mutual respect,\u201d he said. It was all supposed to hinge on the surging turnout of Latino voters for Hillary Clinton and whether or not the Democratic nominee could persuade enough African American voters to emulate them. In the end, according to exit polls, the election result seems to have been more about the remarkable degree of backing from America\u2019s white voters for Donald Trump \u2013 including white college-educated voters and white female voters. Clinton\u2019s lead among non-white voters was substantial, but not enough to make up the difference. It was also less than many anticipated \u2013 and less than Barack Obama\u2019s four years previously. Data from CNN\u2019s Edison national election poll, based on a sample of 24,537 respondents at 350 polling stations, is not definitive \u2013 the US census board will provide that \u2013 and has contained errors in the past. The polling guru Nate Silver, editor of FiveThirtyEight, said exit polls had done an \u201cawfully bad job\u201d on Tuesday night, initially predicting a Clinton landslide. But on the poll\u2019s evidence, although the disaffected, economically insecure white blue-collar voters to whom Trump was always going to appeal certainly helped him win in rustbelt states such as Michigan, they cannot explain the new Republican president\u2019s performance nationwide. What appears to have made the biggest difference on the night was the turnout for Trump of white voters across the board \u2013 of both sexes and almost all ages and education levels. Read the rest here. Readers have been trying to make sense of what happened overnight too - here are some of their thoughts. PapaDiablo: \u201cDonald Trump as President and the Brexit vote are both natural reactions to a people who believe they have had their futures taken away and no longer have a voice. We currently live in a world where opinions are buried and \u201ctolerance\u201d is pushed on people without an attempt to educate them. I was against both but not surprised that both were victorious. When you demand people accept something they refuse and that breeds anger and hate. So when people who will say the things that dwell in your mind but can\u2019t say arrive, you gravitate towards them regardless of the fact they may not have the all the same opinions as you. As a society we created this by expecting generations to accept a new world without fully helping them understand it. This new world is for the lost, scared and hateful and to some degree we all those three things. WILL D: \u201cClinton and the \u2018Establishment\u2019s\u2019 arrogance and complacency lost her the election. Just like Brexit, the establishment assumed that electing Trump as president was just a wild fantasy and would never ever happen in a million years! And therein lies the problem. The false sense of security, the gross misunderstanding of the mood of the people, the conceited belief that they were far superior to Trump and that when it came to actually voting, few people would actually vote for him. How wrong they were \u2026 There is this ever increasing loss of connection with the mood of the people, and ever increasing sense of being able to manipulate the people to believe they were the \u2018good guys\u2019. Democracy purports to be \u2018government by the people, for the people\u2019. But it hasn\u2019t been like that - ever. It probably won\u2019t under Trump either, but he represents a change of direction, and time will tell whether he will be as bad as the establishment and media fear. Anonymous: \u201cAlthough the progressive side of politics couldn\u2019t believe a Trump victory was possible, it has been obvious to some of us for a long time that the dispossessed would eventually rise up against both the educated elites and the power elite. This has been their day. Those without a voice have been ignored by the approved avenues of discourse, which have until now simply shouted down and shut out the voices of the losers in our technocratic imperium. We have been told that in a meritocracy, losers have only themselves to blame and that there has been only one game in town which everyone must play. But the losers still have the vote \u2014 for now.

There\u2019s a lot of people who\u2019ve fought with Donald Trump over the years, never expecting that he would one day become the next US president. A dispatch from The Guardian\u2019s Africa correspondent Jason Burke. Across Africa, commentators and the public expressed concern and shock at Donald Trump\u2019s election. Elisabeth Mokone, 46, a businesswoman in north Johannesburg, South Africa, said she was scared. \u201cI just don\u2019t know what is going to happen,\u201d Mokone said. \u201cWe in Africa need US aid and we need the trade. That\u2019s all going to stop. But more than that, it is like the world is falling apart. Maybe Africa is the only hope now.\u201d Ferial Haffajee, a prominent South African editor and journalist, said she was \u201cvery sad\u201d. \u201cEight years ago we were all up watching a truly profound and historic moment [when Obama won]. It felt like a victory for black people and was really appreciated here. To see the pendulum swing so far so quickly makes me question the whole idea of progressive politics,\u201d Haffajee said. Sam Mpofu, 56, a handyman in the poor Johannesburg neighborhood of Alexandra, said he was surprised that someone who \u201csaid so many bad things about people\u201d had been elected. \u201cWhat were they thinking of? Maybe they were just frightened by all the bad things in the world. Maybe they are racist people. I don\u2019t know,\u201d Mpofu said. In Nigeria, Africa\u2019s most populous state, there was dismay. JJ Omojuwa, one of Nigeria\u2019s most influential bloggers, said that the decision of the American people had to be respected, but expressed his fears for the future. \u201cIt is democracy. The majority has decided. We can only hope he doesn\u2019t shift the foreign policy or the treatment of minorities in a way that means the US is no longer the beacon of democracy it has been for 200 years,\u201d Omojuwa, speaking from Abuja, the Nigerian capital, said. As local leaders rushed to congratulate Trump, experts said agreements giving African companies tariff-free access to US markets might now be threatened. Local media are scrutinizing Trump\u2019s previous speeches for clues about his likely policy towards African nations. \u201cAfrica is going to be way down the agenda. The guy barely knows where Africa is on a map. The only interest will be in terrorism and security,\u201d said Mondli Makhanya, a senior South African journalist. Somalia, in the middle of its own election, congratulated Trump on his victory \u201cat time of great change, challenges and opportunities around the world.\u201d Uhuru Kenyatta, the president of Kenya, congratulated Trump for his\u201d victorious campaign\u201d and Clinton for her \u2018valiant effort\u2019. Kenyatta reminded Trump that the \u201cties that bind Kenya and the United States of America are old, and based in the values that we hold dear: in democracy, in the rule of law, and in the equality of peoples.\u201d \u201cThese values remain dear to the peoples of both nations, and so our friendship will endure,\u201d a statement issued on Wednesday said. Lucy Sibanda, a cleaner from Bulawayo, Zimbabwe, said she did not understand why Obama did not\u201ddo what African leaders do\u201d, and cancel the elections. \u201cHe could have just stopped it when he saw it was not going the right way,\u201d Sibanda, 34, said. Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, just explained how the conceding phone call between the Clinton and Trump camps took place. Conway just said on CNN that she received a phone call from top Clinton aide Huma Abedin laat night while watching the results come in. She \u201chad a nice exchange with Huma,\u201d before Abedin said that Clinton wanted to speak with Trump and the phone was passed over. \u201cThey had maybe a one minute conversation, very gracious very warm, he commended her for being smart and tough and running a hard fought campaign,\u201d said Conway. Hillary Clinton will \u201cdeliver remarks to her staff and supporters\u201d at 9.30 ET this morning at the New Yorker Hotel in Manhattan, according to a statement from her campaign. It will be the first time she\u2019s addressed the public since last night\u2019s election loss. Anti-Trump protests in the Bay Area seem to have quietened for the evening, with protesters making plans for future events. East Bay Times reporter George Kelly captured the moment a protester threw a rock through the newsroom window: There\u2019s been numerous protest fires burning around Oakland: And a flag burning in Portland, Oregon: More anti-Trump protests are likely in coming days. Hillary Clinton may have lost the presidency, but she still remains ahead in the national popular vote. As NPR reports: As of 7.20 am ET, Clinton had amassed 59,059,121 votes nationally, to Trump\u2019s 58,935,231 \u2014 a margin of 123,890 that puts Clinton on track to become the fifth U.S. presidential candidate to win the popular vote but lose the election. The last person to win the popular vote but not the presidency was Al Gore in the 2000 election. Video: how election night unfolded The missed opportunity for the US to have its first female president is being felt by women all over the world. LG Godwin from Virginia feels that despite her issues with Clinton she voted for her with pride. Regardless of her flaws she should go down in history alongside the greatest heroines of the suffrage movement: I have had a man treat me the way our president elect says he can treat women and I feel like that man is threatening me again. I have spent the night reassuring friends of color and in the LGBTQ community that I have their back even as I, as a woman and an academic, fear for my own future. I have spent the evening wanting to apologize to friends around the world for the harm that will inevitably come to them, and their children, from this presidency. I have had my issues with Clinton, not least on the subject of the Iraq War and general neoliberalism, but I voted for her, proudly, with tears of joy in my eyes yesterday. And I feel for her now. No one has a \u2018right\u2019 to the presidency, but for the most qualified candidate in history, and one manifestly more suited to the moment/addressing the very issues Trump voters said they wanted addressed, to lose to such an appalling excuse for a human is incomprehensible. I am sorry, world. I am ashamed. For anyone reassuring their children today, please know that there ARE Americans who reject hate and selfishness.\u201d Rahel from Switzerland says she would have loved her younger siblings to have been able to see a capable and smart woman run such an important country: To see a woman as president would have meant so much to me. I would have been so glad to live in a world where this was possible. This election makes me feel insecure about being a woman, it makes me think that women, after all, can not do anything. I know of course, deep down, that this is not true, that there are so many amazing women and men out there who do such wonderful work for equality of all genders, races and lifestyles, but I also know that this horrible feeling is going to stay with me for a long time. I feel so bad for Mrs Clinton, she has thrown herself into this election with all her heart, with such good preparation and experience and she has now been rejected for the worst possible alternative. I know she will find the strength to come back from this, but I am afraid that she too, will be stuck with this sick feeling of being so powerless in the face of depravity and hate. FeministGirl from Norway says the women of the world are in despair today: I\u2019m not a fan of Clinton, however, how can the people of the US vote against a president who wanted more accessible college education, better health care coverage, an increase in minimum pay and aims to represent women all over the world? How can they, instead, vote for two angry little men who are abnormally obsessed with women\u2019s vaginas?! The Prime Minister of Slovenia \u2013 the First Lady-elect (is that a term?) Melania Trump\u2019s country of birth \u2013 offers his congratulations to Trump. President Obama called Donald Trump to congratulate him on his win and to invite him to the White House on Thursday, according to a statement from the White House. \u201cEnsuring a smooth transition of power is one of the top priorities the president identified at the beginning of the year and a meeting with the president-elect is the next step,\u201d reads the statement from the White House press secretary. Obama also phoned Secretary Clinton to express his \u201cadmiration for the strong campaign she waged.\u201d Obama and the First Lady were highly involved in Clinton\u2019s campaign, hosting rallies and making speeches on her behalf for months. President Obama will address the public today on how the country can \u201ccome together\u201d after this bitter election. Here\u2019s the full statement: Donald Trump is getting an early start to his day, tweeting this morning: Donald Trump\u2019s victory will loom large over the UN climate talks underway in Marrakech this week. The president elect has previously said he does not believe in climate change science, and has promised to pull the US out of the Paris climate change agreement, which came into force last Friday. Withdrawing from Paris is something he has promised to do in his first 100 days, though experts believe it would take at least four years to unpick it because the accord is now law. Campaigners warned that the US risked being left behind on the economic opportunities of switching to clean energy. Here\u2019s a wrap of reaction to his win. May Boeve, executive director of climate group 350.org, said: \u201cTrump\u2019s election is a disaster, but it cannot be the end of the international climate process. We\u2019re not giving up the fight and neither should the international community. Trump will try and slam the brakes on climate action, which means we need to throw all of our weight on the accelerator. Kelly Stone, policy analyst at development NGO ActionAid, said: \u201cThe US has joined the Paris Agreement and must continue to meet its climate obligations. Leaving this important international agreement will damage our credibility with important overseas partners and would be a major setback in the fight against climate change.\u201d Mohamed Adow, international climate campaigner at the UK-based Christian Aid, said: \u201cLast year\u2019s Paris Agreement showed the world was united in its concern about climate change and its commitment to decarbonising the global economy. The rest of the world will not risk a global climate catastrophe because of one man\u2019s opposition.\u201d For those in desperate need of cheering up this morning, check out our \u201cHow to cope with the new world order (with kittens)\u201d blog, which has plenty of videos of cute baby animals. The United States is waking up to a new president, after Donald Trump won the general election in a shock victory overnight. At 2.30am ET, the Associated Press called the election for Trump, after a projected win in Wisconsin ensured he\u2019d reach the magic 270 electoral college figure. Shortly afterwards, Hillary Clinton called Trump to concede the election. \u201cNow it\u2019s time for America to bind the wounds of division ... I says it is time for us to come together as one united people,\u201d said president-elect Trump at his election party in New York. \u201cI pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all Americans, and this is so important for me,\u201d said Trump. Clinton did not speak at her event last night \u2013 instead her campaign manager John Podesta told the crowd to head home. \u201cGet some sleep. We\u2019ll have more to say tomorrow,\u201d he said. Her social media has not been updated since the polls closed. A concession speech is expected from Clinton this morning, although exact details remain unknown. The Republicans won big all round \u2013 maintaining and strengthening its control of the Senate 51-47 after wins in Florida, Pennsylvania and Indiana. Democrats gained just one win: double amputee Iraq war veteran Tammy Duckworth in Illinois. Congress also remains Republican controlled 236-191, after Democrats failed to win contests it had hoped for. Right now we\u2019re keeping our eyes on global markets - Asian stocks and the US dollar dropped after news of a likely Trump win, anti-Trump protests (Oakland, New York, Los Angeles and Washington DC have seen protests overnight) and international leaders responding to the election results.
