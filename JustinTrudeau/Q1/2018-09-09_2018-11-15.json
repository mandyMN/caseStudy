          "bodyText": "In political science classes in the decades to come, Veterans Day Weekend 2018 is bound to be popular essay topic in the course on the Narcissist Presidency. It has all the hallmarks of the Trump era: a fabricated story that congeals as fact in the president\u2019s brain and moments later is broadcast on Twitter. Countless diplomats and officials are sent scurrying to limit the damage, as the chief executive doubles down, refusing to admit a mistake. A key source material for the students to track down will be an interview Emmanuel Macron gave to the radio station Europe 1 ahead of the weekend\u2019s events marking the first world war centennial. In one of his answers, Macron restated his support for the idea of a European army so that the continent could defend itself alone \u201cwithout only relying on the United States\u201d. In another segment of the interview, the French president talked about cybersecurity, the pressure on multilateralism and the threat to pull out of nuclear agreements, and said: \u201cWe should protect ourselves when it comes to China, Russia and even the United States.\u201d What was a slightly provocative turn of phrase was made much worse when put through the filter of some of the US press where the two issues were conflated, leaving the impression that Macron wanted a European army to fend off threats from the US. And once that had been chewed up and spat out on Twitter, it sounded like Europe was on the point of invading New Jersey. We may have to wait for the next tell-all account of life inside the court of King Donald to know what specifically set him off, but the president arrived in Paris in the early hours of Saturday morning in a foul mood, repeating the garbled version of Macron\u2019s martial plans and tweeting his disdain. Anyone from his White House entourage who might have tried to set the president right has long since resigned or been fired. The sealed bubble around Trump clearly played a role in the fiasco-filled weekend and its aftermath \u2013 and is becoming a significant factor in the presidency as it approaches its third year. When they met in Paris, Macron sought to reassure his jet-lagged visitor that he had been misinterpreted and did not see the US as a threat, but Trump seems to have made up his mind and looked grumpy throughout. And then it rained. Presidential aides declared it too wet for the president to attend a memorial event at a war cemetery in Belleau, the site of a battle that killed 2,000 US marines. The ceremony also marked the Marine Corps 243rd birthday, and Trump\u2019s retreat to a Parisian hotel in the face of drizzle led to an eruption of derision from former officers as well as the usual critics back home. The French army rubbed salt in the wounds by trolling Trump on social media with a picture of a soldier on a soggy assault course, noting: \u201cIt\u2019s raining, but it\u2019s no big deal. We stay motivated.\u201d All of this hits Trump in a weak spot. He avoided military service during Vietnam, and his claims of monolithic support among the armed forces ring less true with each passing month. Polls show that his popularity among the troops has declined sharply since he was elected. On Tuesday he tried some damage limitation, insisting on Twitter there had been \u201calmost zero visibility\u201d, and he had unsuccessfully tried to persuade his security staff to go by road. Those claims were weakened by the fact that other dignitaries managed to reach their destinations on Saturday, and that, on his return to Washington, Trump ducked out of the traditional Veteran\u2019s Day appearance at Arlington National Cemetery, directly across the Potomac river from the White House. As has been demonstrated before, the most dangerous moment for US alliances is often when Trump leaves a meeting with his fellow leaders. As he was flying away from a G7 meeting in Quebec in June, the president heard about some indirectly critical remarks made by Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, and instantly ordered the withdrawal of US support for a joint statement that had been agreed a few hours earlier. On this occasion, after being generally complimentary to Macron during the trip, Trump woke up furious with the French president on Tuesday morning. He repeated the false claim about Macron\u2019s intentions for a European army, and followed it up with the well-worn jingoistic claim that France would be speaking German if it had not been for US intervention in two world wars. The president then pivoted, as he often does against domestic opponents, to deride the French president\u2019s unpopularity and then signaled he would express his irritation through trade policy, claiming France imposed \u201cbig tariffs\u201d on US wine and threatening retaliation. The tariffs on US wine are higher, but they are set by the EU, after trade negotiations with the US, not by France. Over the first two years of his presidency, the point has been explained to Trump repeatedly. But in his outbursts against Germany, France and others, he ignores the distinction between the EU and its member states. Whether Trump acts out of ignorance and deafness to expertise, or sheer political expediency has been much debated, but the distinction may not matter much. Raw attacks on other countries and talk of tariffs plays well with his base. Whether they are well founded or not does not matter. At best, days of governmental effort will now be wasted, but no new tariffs will be imposed simply out of presidential ire. The outcomes could be far worse when it is not Emmanuel Macron on the receiving end of Trump\u2019s petulance but say, Kim Jong-un after the honeymoon with the North Korean regime goes sour, and there are nuclear missiles rather than cabernet sauvignon at stake.",

The senior Labour MP Mike Gapes said: \u201cGiven the clear inability of this new Pakistani government of Imran Khan to stop these mobs from intimidating and killing Christians in Pakistan, is it not time to reassess our relations with Pakistan? There are big concerns if religious minorities in Pakistan are not safe.\u201d McDonald said the Britain\u2019s relationship with Pakistan relationship was important to both countries. He added: \u201cIf the objective is to protect life and some other country can provide some more complete safe harbour, why should the UK not be open to working with that country?\u201d The Pakistan foreign office confirmed on Tuesday that it had been holding talks with the Canadian foreign ministry over granting Bibi asylum. Confirmation of talks between the two governments came after the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said on Monday his government was talking to Pakistan about the case. \u201cWe are in discussions with the Pakistani government,\u201d Trudeau said in an interview with Agence France-Presse (AFP) in Paris, where he was attending a peace conference organised by the French president, Emmanuel Macron.",

It was clear the House of Saud was involved in Khashoggi\u2019s killing, Erdo\u011fan reiterated in comments to the tabloid Yeni \u015eafak on Tuesday, but he did not think King Salman, for whom he had \u201climitless respect\u201d, could be behind such a crime. \u201cIt must be revealed who gave them [the Saudi team] the order to murder,\u201d Erdo\u011fan said. After two weeks of denying it had anything to do with Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance, the kingdom said he had died in a fight, before changing its story again to say the Turkish investigation\u2019s findings indicated his killing was premeditated. Khashoggi\u2019s death has created the biggest diplomatic crisis for Riyadh since 9/11, reigniting a debate about arms sales to the country, its human rights record and the war in Yemen \u2013 but little concrete action has been taken by western powers so far. The UK foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, travelled to Riyadh and Abu Dhabi on Monday for talks concerning both the Khashoggi investigation and the violence in Hodeidah, a key port city in Yemen. Ankara\u2019s most damning evidence has come from audio recordings from the consulate which it is believed were obtained by Turkish intelligence officers who hacked the Saudi hit team\u2019s communications. On Monday, the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, became the first western leader to confirm the tapes\u2019 existence, telling reporters in Paris that Canadian officials had listened to them. The New York Times, quoting sources familiar with the recording, reported that the hit team\u2019s leader, Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb \u2013 a security officer who frequently travelled with Prince Mohammed \u2013 picked up a phone at the consulate to say \u201ctell your boss\u201d the operation had been successful. The paper said Turkish intelligence officers had told US officials they believed Mutreb was speaking to one of the prince\u2019s aides, and that US intelligence officials believed \u201cyour boss\u201d was a reference to Mohammed. On Tuesday, the Turkish pro-government newspaper Sabah published photos of what it said were x-rays of the Saudi team\u2019s luggage when they left Istanbul via Atat\u00fcrk airport. They showed syringes, electric shock devices, large scissors, staple guns, walkie-talkies and a signal jammer. The bags were not searched because the men were travelling under diplomatic immunity.",

Emma, my frustration is that in the wake of terrorist attacks we are presented with a very familiar refrain from our political leaders that calls on Muslim communities to do more, that calls on Muslim leaders to condemn terrorism again and again and again, even more louder, and I think that we need to move beyond words of condemnation. I think we need to move beyond these calls for the Muslim community which every law enforcement agency that I\u2019ve ever spoken to recognises is a very important ally in security.

I spoke out against him, did a lot of media interviews against him, confronted him and confronted those young men who were being radicalised by him. The Muslim community here in Perth: teachers, imams, sheikhs, parents all banded together. They closed their doors to him, they prevented their sons from mingling with him, they reported his activities to the police. And together, working together, they effectively removed him from the streets of Perth. These are the kinds of things that we need to be doing. We need to be looking at how we can best generate community expertise, community intelligence, communities working together to eradicate terrorism from within our midst.</p> </blockquote> <p>So no problem in calling out extremist behaviour, Aly says, and she believes that to be important.

<p>Australia\u2019s major electricity companies have raised questions about whether the Morrison government has the legal authority to proceed with its so-called \u201cbig stick\u201d threat to break

business.</p> <p>The legal advice revealed on Tuesday says if the government intends to proceed with what amounts to \u201cquasi-judicial\u201d interventions, such as imposing price regulation, requiring generators to contract with third parties, and forcing divestment, then the power should be exercised independently of ministers \u201cso that the decision-making process is not influenced

morning</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Well, after 24 hours of criticism from everyone from the National Farmers\u2019 Federation, to Jimmy Barnes, Labor and Kochie, the government has decided to reverse its funding cut to Foodbank\u2019s Key Staples program.</p> <p>Just before leaving for Singapore, <strong>Scott Morrison</strong> intervened to ask for the issue to be fixed. <strong>Paul Fletcher</strong> has responded by boosting the funding for food relief by $1.485m over the next four and a half years, bringing the total budget to $5.985m.</p> <p>That means no one gets cut and a third provider is funded.</p> <p>It\u2019s a problem which didn\u2019t need to be created. While there was a tender process, and while OzHarvest, the third provider chosen, does do excellent work, it does a different job to the one Foodbank provides, so cutting one to pay for the other was a pretty shortsighted decision, especially when we are talking about the small amounts of money (for a national budget) we are seeing here.</p> <p>So good to see common sense won out.</p> <p>Elsewhere, the Senate is still sitting, as it continues its solo week, but it will most likely be action outside the chamber that captures attention.</p> <p>Summit season has officially began, which I think makes <strong>Michael McCormack</strong> our acting prime minister. Morrison has Singapore, then PNG, then Argentina, as well as two more parliament sessions, but the domestic issues keep ticking over as well.</p> <p>We\u2019ll keep you abreast of all of them. You\u2019ve got Mike Bowers behind the lens and the Guardian brain\u2019s trust on the job. I\u2019ve got my second coffee.

          "bodyText": "One last update (because the Guardian brains trust never stops): The Senate has just passed a motion, moved by Labor\u2019s Malarndirri McCarthy, demanding the Indigenous affairs minister, Nigel Scullion, make public the advice he received from his department, as well as other documents relating to the grants he made to the Northern Territory Cattlemen\u2019s Association (NTCA), the Amateur Fisherman\u2019s Association of the Northern Territory (AFANT) and the Northern Territory Seafood Council (NTSC) as well as copies of their grant applications, by Thursday morning. Scullion copped a fair bit of heat, as we reported last week, for allocating grants worth almost $500,000 to these organisations, to help them argue their \u201cdetriment\u201d cases in land rights claims, most of which have been held up for years by unresolved detriment issues. He told Senate estimates the money was for legal fees for the groups to argue how they might be negatively impacted by land rights claims but the groups have all since said that\u2019s not quite the case. Scullion used the IAS \u2013 the Indigenous advancement strategy \u2013 to fund the groups. One of them, the NT Seafood Council, he used to chair. The IAS is meant to address Indigenous disadvantage. At least for today. Because there are two whole more days of this Senate-palooza ahead of us and, really, I don\u2019t want to peak too early. Better to ration out such an inspired display of our democracy than gorge all at once. The country is in the hands of Michael McCormack, as acting prime minister. So sleep well. Massive thank yous to Mike Bowers, for the photos and also the food he supplies me with to keep me standing, and to the Guardian brains trust. And, as always, thank you to you, for reading, and joining us on this never ending descent into madness. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow morning but, in the meantime, take care of you. Angus Taylor, the minister for lowering electricity prices in this age of Pro-Mo government, welcomed the Greenhouse and Energy Minimum Standards Act draft report thusly: The GEMS Act regulates the energy efficiency of appliances and equipment by setting minimum energy performance standards and energy rating label requirements. The draft report demonstrates that the GEMS Act has proven very effective at reducing costs for consumers and contains a number of recommendations to strengthen the operation of the act. The current review is an important step in a process of continuous improvement to ensure the act remains appropriate and effective. The government encourages stakeholders to continue to participate in this independent review by making a submission on the draft report. The final report is expected to be delivered mid-2019. The government remains committed to ensuring customers remain at the focus of its energy policy, and promoting efficient energy usage is an important part of this. The GEMS legislation has driven significant improvements in energy efficiency and reduced energy consumption, energy costs and greenhouse gas emissions. The GEMS regulations save Australian households between $140 and $220 on their electricity bill each year (about 10 to 15% of the average annual bill). In 2017, net savings to the Australian economy ranged between $862m to $1.64bn with greenhouse gas emissions savings between 4.6 million and 7.4 million tonnes.

From Mike Bowers\u2019s lens to your eyeballs. *extreme Oprah voice* You get a video! And you get a video! EVERYONE GETS A VIDEO!!!!!! Senate question time ends. And with it, my will to keep going. Onwards and upwards! Murray Watt, with an assist from Penny Wong, tries to ask Michaelia Cash more about the issue, but she gives the same answer and a little more of my brain bleeds out of my ears. Murray Watt wants to know about this: And when Michaelia Cash found out. She said she just learned it from him, just now, that her former staffer is now a private citizen and \u201cyou can subpoena anybody\u201d. Kim Carr is back with more questions on Chris Crewther, asking if Matthew Canavan is aware that the company Crewther invested in received a particular government grant. Canavan says the company received approval for a bridging grant, but that the company withdrew its application. Carr asks why it wasn\u2019t included in advice provided about the grants the biotech received. Basically, the answer is because the application was withdrawn. Fraser Anning is asking questions along the same lines as Pauline Hanson did yesterday \u2013 basically, will Australia stop accepting immigrants from Islamic countries. Michaelia Cash repeats yesterday\u2019s answer \u2013 that Australia has a non-discriminatory immigration policy, but adds that Australia\u2019s security and intelligence agencies are constantly reviewing national security. And she is cranky. Very, very cranky. Penny Wong asks whether Scott Morrison has put Australia\u2019s relationship with Indonesia at risk by raising the prospect of moving our Israeli embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and, then, whether Malcolm Turnbull was right to warn against the discussion. The answers are all the same \u2013 Australia has a constructive relationship with Indonesia and will decide its foreign policy itself. Penny Wong to Mathias Cormann \u2013 on the Indonesian free trade deal. She points to the AFR story which says Scott Morrison has confirmed that the deal, which was expected to be signed between the two countries this week, has been delayed. Wong asks why. \u201cDon\u2019t always believe everything that is written in a newspaper,\u201d Mathias Cormann said. Except \u2013 the prime minister said it. On television. https://twitter.com/SkyNewsAust/status/1061778300870131713 Honestly. Make it stop. I feel like Josh Frydenberg looks in this video The only thing worse than a Dorothy Dixer is a supplementary Dorothy Dixer #fact But Marise Payne won\u2019t say if it will be raised on Friday, when Scott Morrison meets with Shinzo Abe. \u201cIt is a matter for them,\u201d she says, but again says it is regularly raised by Australia to Japan. Peter Whish-Wilson is now asking Marise Payne about this statement from Australian Marine Conservation Society (AMCS): \u201cThe Japanese whaling fleet has left port and is on its way to the Southern Ocean to again kill whales in the name of \u201cscience\u201d. With the Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe due to visit Australia this week, we call on prime minister Scott Morrison to urgently step up action against Japan. \u201cIn previous years it has taken the whaling fleet 3\u20134 weeks to reach the Southern Ocean where 333 minke whales are in the harpoon firing line, including pregnant females, as part of a 12-year program of \u201cresearch\u201d that will kill almost 4,000 Antarctic minke whales. \u201cIt is unconscionable that the Japanese whalers are once again planning to kill hundreds of whales in the name of \u2018science\u2019,\u201d said AMCS CEO Darren Kindleysides. \u201cIn September, the International Whaling Commission rejected Japan\u2019s outrageous attempt to end the global ban on commercial whaling. ... In 2014, in a case brought by the Australian government, the International Court of Justice ruled that Japan\u2019s \u2018JARPA II\u2019 Antarctic whaling program was illegal and must stop. However, in 2015, the Japanese Government introduced a new Antarctic whaling program and continues to send its whaling fleet to the Southern Ocean for an annual whale hunt.\u201d ***end statement*** Payne says Australia is disappointed in the decision to resume whaling and has continued to make approaches to Japan on the issue. Whish-Wilson asks why Australia is \u201crolling out the red carpet\u201d for Abe in light of Japan\u2019s decision. Payne says there is a lot to Australia\u2019s relationship with Japan, including defence, but will continue to discuss the \u201cstrong opposition\u201d Australia has to whaling. Right, after five questions on this, we still have no idea why. Why was Scott Morrison let go from Tourism Australia after just 18 months? Basically, Mathias Cormann said he has no answers for decisions made by the John Howard government. So, no answer, then. Because Cormann says he was an \u201coutstanding\u201d managing director of Tourism Australia. And obviously this country has a habit of letting \u201coutstanding\u201d people leave their positions early. Michael McCormack had a chat to ABC Brisbane this morning, where he was asked if Brisbane was getting its fair share of infrastructure funding from the federal government. The federal government and the Queensland state government have been having funding fights over the funding for the M1 highway \u2013 the feds have offered 50/50, while the Queensland government wants 80/20. Asked about Brisbane road infrastructure, and to speak to those in the audience stuck in traffic, or about to be stuck in traffic, McCormack suggested they leave Brisbane. \u201cWhat they can do is think about moving to a regional centre, because there are jobs in Mackay, there are jobs in Rockhampton, there are jobs in Cairns, there are some fabulous regional centres \u2013 Toowoomba. \u201cThey are growing, there are jobs there, there\u2019s friendly people. Their communities are small enough to care, but big enough to get a good cup of coffee.\u201d But will all those people in Brisbane stuck in traffic want to move to a regional centre? \u201cNo, but we are getting on with the job, building better infrastructure. Look at the Beerburrum to Nambour rail that we are investing $390 million in, to make sure that those people can not only work in Brisbane, but can live on the Sunshine Coast. We are making those opportunities for people, cutting those rail times by 40 minutes one way, so that\u2019s a saving of up to an hour, 80 minutes to spend more time with their families at the end of the day.\u201d So, Brisbanites. Now you know. Just move. NSW MLC Jeremy Buckingham has responded to calls for his resignation from two Greens colleagues \u2013 Jenny Leong in NSW parliament and Mehreen Faruqi in Canberra. The pair put out a statement earlier today, and Leong has also used parliamentary privilege in state parliament to say Buckingham\u2019s treatment of some women had a \u201creal and lasting consequence\u201d. She told the parliament she knew there were \u201cactive volunteers who have stepped aside or resigned as members as a result of Jeremy\u2019s behaviour\u201d. Leong did not detail new allegations but she accused Buckingham of acting in an \u201caggressive and intimidating manner\u201d towards her twice this year. \u201cJeremy, you have had countless opportunities to take responsibility for this, to apologise to those impacted, and to seek to address them. Instead you have followed with further aggressive tactics,\u201d she said. \u201cI know you feel like you are the victim of internal party attacks, but you must acknowledge your role in this and stand aside before more damage can be done.\u201d Buckingham has responded by referring to one allegation, which he says he was cleared of after it was investigated by the Greens. He is refusing to quit. Labor\u2019s Doug Cameron launches straight into it \u2013 why was Scott Morrison sacked by Tourism Australia? It is almost Senate question time time. Yay. Just a note on the legal advice \u2013 all the candidates who were sent to the high court, including Labor\u2019s three, had legal advice they were fine. All of them. From Barnaby Joyce to Susan Lamb. The only power to decide how the constitution should be interpreted lies with the high court. Meanwhile, this is still happening: Look, everyone has their strengths and should play to them. And for those things that aren\u2019t our strengths? Well, I guess practise? Or leave it to the professionals? The federal Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi and the New South Wales Greens MP Jenny Leong have released a statement calling for the NSW Greens MLC Jeremy Buckingham to stand aside and not contest the next election. \u201cWe have made this decision as independent women and we have not taken it lightly,\u201d the statement says. Stepping into the NSW parliament for a moment; Labor won\u2019t be supporting the motion to suspend standing orders to bring on the Greens schools anti-discrimination bill (the one which aims to stop religious schools from discriminating against staff, as well as teachers). So the motion has no chance of getting up. After this motion, it is all government business, with the GST legislation David Leyonhjelm is so worked up about next on the agenda. Scott Morrison has released a statement on his upcoming Asean trip: I will travel to Singapore over 13\u201315 November to participate in the East Asia Summit and bilateral meetings with some of Australia\u2019s key partners. The East Asia Summit is the region\u2019s premier forum for strategic dialogue and helps to ensure the Indo-Pacific remains peaceful, open and prosperous. The Australian government\u2019s international agenda advances our domestic priorities \u2013 keeping our economy strong, keeping Australians safe and keeping Australians together. Our focus is on progressing practical initiatives in areas including counter-terrorism, infrastructure and maritime cooperation. In addition to the East Asia Summit, I will join leaders to review progress towards the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, an important agreement that will help to promote closer regional economic integration and create trade and investment opportunities for Australian businesses. I will also participate in a meeting with my ASEAN counterparts, building on the momentum of the historic ASEAN-Australia Special Summit held in Sydney earlier this year. Frank dialogue and mutual respect and cooperation underpin the East Asia Summit, and I look forward to the opportunities it presents. Speaking of the Greens, they are trying to suspend standing orders in the Senate to bring debate for its discrimination free schools bill forward. They have also just been asked to remove badges, which had \u201c$75\u201d on them (which is in relation to wanting to raise Newstart by $75 a week), because they are too big. Scott Ryan says when it comes to size, it should be in proportion to lapel size. Peter Whish-Wilson says in that case, the 70s safari suits might be making a comeback. Richard Di Natale, who has a much smaller badge, is allowed to keep his on. Having watched last night\u2019s Four Corner\u2019s episode on Michelle Guthrie and Justin Milne, Sarah Hanson-Young is calling for the entire ABC board to be sacked; \u201cAfter hearing the allegations put forward by Michelle Guthrie and a number of concerning statements made by Justin Milne on Four Corners, it is clear the board must be sacked. What\u2019s also clear is the board is plagued with political interference from the communications minister and the Liberal government,\u201d Greens media spokesperson Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said in her statement. \u201cThe board may have refused to speak to Four Corners, but each individual member will be called before the upcoming Senate inquiry. \u201cThe Senate inquiry into the mismanagement and political interference at the ABC comes at a good time. It is clear that board members themselves have questions to answer and need to be held accountable for their decisions. \u201cIt\u2019s time to put a broom through the board and replace it with people who are there for the interest of the public broadcaster and the Australian people.\u201d Oh, the Senate is about to start. Honestly, it is a bit easy to forget these days. Bill Shorten has also spoken on Bourke Street at his morning press conference; Well, first of all, what happened on Friday was just an evil tragedy. As my colleague said earlier on television, Sisto, the man who got killed, was committing an act of kindness and was met with an act of evil. I understand people are upset. My own kids catch the tram through the city. We\u2019ve all ... I\u2019ve lived in Melbourne for most of my life. We\u2019ve all walked past that old Commonwealth Bank building there. So it is shocking. I would like to think that what we saw on Friday doesn\u2019t happen in Australia, but it does. Now, I can understand why people want to lash out, want to blame different groups or want to blame politicians or want to blame Mr Morrison. I actually think we\u2019ve got to take a step back. Someone died. Two people died. And the coroner will have an investigation. That\u2019s a pretty good process. In terms of the debate about the Muslim community, there are a few radicalised troublemakers, no question, and pretending that isn\u2019t the case doesn\u2019t make it go away. But by the same token, absolutely the vast bulk of Muslim Australians, the vast, vast bulk, love their country and I don\u2019t want to tag a whole group of Australians just by the actions of a very few. I get that some people want to blame the government and authorities, I think the authorities are trying to do the best they can. We need calmness and coolness. Our Australian way of life tolerates a range of views as long as you adhere to the laws. The police are doing a great job and I want to congratulate them again. As a parent whose kids walk up and down Bourke Street and whose wife has shopped there and walked up and down there, I am pleased that Vic Pol were so responsive so quickly and I think I speak for a lot of people. To the family of the deceased and to Sisto and the other two people who were wounded, this is shocking and nothing can make sense of that, but I just say to people, I understand if anyone wants to perhaps lash out. It\u2019s a disturbing event. I get that, but I think now is the time to work out what can we all do better. It\u2019s not about one group or one politician. What can we all do better to keep Australians safe?\u201d An exclusive investigation by the Guardian today reveals a company owned by the Papua New Guinean prime minister Peter O\u2019Neill received a US$32m government contract to build bridges in the country, in a process with \u201cserious irregularities\u201d that may have violated anticorruption guidelines. The Guardian\u2019s revelations reveal serious concerns about O\u2019Neill\u2019s business practices at a time when he is hoping to promote PNG as a site for investment and trade. World leaders, including Scott Morrison, Mike Pence, Xi Jinping, Jacinda Ardern and Justin Trudeau are set to arrive in Port Moresby later this week for the Apec summit. An investigative criminologist said there has never been anything like these revelations before. \u201cO\u2019Neill is PNG\u2019s Mr Teflon, while others around him have crashed against the rocks, he seems to escape unscathed. This Asian Development Bank investigation is a bone-shaking exception to the rule. An international body has uncovered activity by a company he owns which appears to fit within the dictionary definition of fraud.\u201d In recent weeks, Morrison has signalled his intention to pivot toward the Pacific. Last week, he revealed $3bn in Pacific funding to counter Chinese influence in the region. Peter O\u2019Neill came to Sydney earlier this month where he signed off on a joint naval base to be located on Manus Island. With Scott Morrison in Melbourne to pay his respects to the memory of Sisto Malaspina, the politicking is continuing in Canberra. Liberal Democratic senator David Leyonhjelm, from NSW, has issued a press release imbued with Libertarian wit criticising the government\u2019s GST distribution plans. Leyonhjelm says the Morrison government\u2019s GST amendments \u2013 currently being debated in the Senate \u2013 will snatch $9bn from taxpayers over and above their GST payments to throw at state and territory governments \u201clike confetti\u201d. He says the proposed system will continue to short-change \u201chigh-performing states\u201d while propping up \u201cbeggar states\u201d like South Australia and Tasmania. South Australia and Tasmania \u201cspend more time hugging trees and wind turbines than developing [themselves]\u201d \u2013 whatever that means. These parasitic states will continue to impede development and smother small businesses in red tape, while pouring millions of other states\u2019 dollars into bloated local bureaucracies. In South Australia, almost 13% of the entire workforce is now sucking on the state government teat,\u201d he said. The South Australian and Tasmanian governments love making feel-good statements about cutting greenhouse gas emissions in their own backyard, while expecting extravagant handouts from the heavy-lifting states to compensate for their economic incompetency. The government\u2019s legislation, which is likely to pass the senate this week, will deliver an additional $9bn in extra untied funding to states and territories over 10 years and an extra $1bn in perpetuity once fully implemented. It will prevent states such as Western Australia receiving just 30 cents in the dollar from their GST contribution by introducing a 70 cents floor for all states, rising to 75 cents in 2024\u201325. It will also change the GST\u2019s equalisation standard by basing it on the fiscal capacity of the stronger of New South Wales or Victoria \u2013 rather than the strongest state in the country in any given year. The West Australian government has been fighting for these changes for years. Australian Council of Social Services head, Cass Goldie spoke to Sky News about some of the wider cuts to Australia\u2019s social services budget this morning, in the wake of the decision to reverse the funding cut to Foodbank. But Scott Morrison says this is not a migration issue, but a radicalisation issue, pointing out, again, that Hassan Khalif Shire Ali was radicalised in Australia. He came here when he was five years old, for goodness\u2019 sake and those who suggest it\u2019s an issue of migration, he was five years old. What happened here, happened here. And so we need to focus on what happened here and that is a man grew up in this country, and was radicalised with these hateful views and beliefs and he didn\u2019t get it from the postman. He didn\u2019t get it from the police. He got it from the community he was living in and the people he was speaking to. And this is what we have to ensure does not take hold in this country. We\u2019re in a position where we can deal with this. So I\u2019m urging positively to encourage all leaders, all those who take positions of responsibility in these communities to ensure that they work closely with authorities so that this does not take hold, because it\u2019s your children, your cousins, your family members, your community, and I want to work with you to protect the integrity of these communities, so they are resilient to this sort of hate and violent extremist Islamic practices are not taking root in this city, or any part of Australia or any other part of the country. The prime minister said he believes his spiritual leaders would know what is happening within their congregation: Communities need to ensure they weed this out. We can\u2019t have the situation, frankly, where you have in religious communities, you know, police officers and others \u2013 these are places of faith. These are prayer rooms. These are places of instruction. There are people who are seeking counselling and guidance on any number of issues as they should be able to do and that\u2019s happening in their communities. I\u2019m a member of a religious community and my pastor knows what\u2019s going on in our church community. He would know if there was someone, or his wife would know if there was someone, leading a local Bible study group or something like that, who was teaching things that were not in accordance with what our faith believed. They\u2019d be pointing that out and they\u2019d be dealing with it because that\u2019s the responsibility of a religious leader, to actually protect the integrity of your faith community. Now, this is an assault on those communities, I should stress. I\u2019m standing up for the integrity of their communities and want to work closely with religious leaders and others in the community to ensure that they don\u2019t allow these wolves in, because these wolves will take advantage of vulnerable people. And I want to protect those people and I am looking to work together with religious communities, particularly Islamic communities, where we know that radical extremist Islam can take seed and we\u2019ve seen it here again and we have seen it on other occasions and let\u2019s not forget about the attack in Parramatta. That radicalisation took place at lightning speed with a young boy so this can happen fast. It can happen over a longer period of time and I\u2019m not going to look the other way and I\u2019m not going to allow others to make executions for people who want to look the other way. On his calls that Islamic community, particularly it\u2019s spiritual leaders, need to do more to root out extremist terrorism, Scott Morrison said: I will say simply what I said on the weekend, that the violent extremist Islamic terrorist who did this on this street was radicalised in this country. He wasn\u2019t radicalised in a suburban mall he wasn\u2019t radicalised in a schoolroom. He was radicalised in a community here in Melbourne. Now, we all have jobs to do to keep Australians safe. It\u2019s my job to ensure that our intelligence agencies and our law enforcement agencies both have the resources and the powers to enable them to do their jobs. It\u2019s the job of communities to protect themselves and to keep the wolves from coming in amongst the sheep in their own religious communities. We want a country where people can have freedom of expression and freedom of belief. Of course we do. I\u2019m a passionate supporter of this. But with that comes great responsibility. In religious communities, we need to ensure that people who would seek to infiltrate, people who would seek to take advantage of vulnerable people and spread hateful doctrines and idealologies that can inspire people to the most evil of acts, religious communities have a responsibility. So I won\u2019t cop the excuses. There are responsibilities for all of us and, importantly, in religious communities, there are Imams and Muslim communities that are absolutely doing this and they are protecting the integrity of their religious communities. And I applaud them. And I know people and I\u2019ve worked with people who are doing exactly that and they are brave and they are courageous. But for those who want to stick their head in the sand, for those who want to make executions for those who stick their head in the sand, for those who want to walk post those comments and make excuses, are you not making Australia safer. You are giving people an excuse to look the other way and not deal with things right in front of you. If there are people in a religious communities, an Islamic community, that are bringing in hateful, violent, extremist ideologies into your community, you\u2019ve got to call it out, because it will take root and it will take root with your sons and daughters, with your friends, with your uncles, with your cousins, and it will infest and it will lead to the sorts of things that we have seen here on Bourke Street and I don\u2019t want to so see that happen ever again. Scott Morrison: But there are so many Sistos here in Melbourne. The Sistos of Melbourne built this city, particularly after the Second World War. They created the businesses, they raised their families, they worked hard. They were honest people. They looked after each other. They were caring. They were compassionate. And this is the great city it is today because of people just like Sisto. And so to come here and be able to pay respects to him today \u2013 as others have, and rightly have, and more will \u2013 you know, the best way we respond to these and radicalist, extremist, Islamist attacks, is to do the very thing that they would have us stop doing, and that would be to stop smiling, like Sisto would every day, to stop living a life full of joy and full of compassion and full of freedom, like Sisto did every single day. I mean, he came here for the life that he was able to live here, and he lived it. He lived it. And he touched so many other lives. And they would have that taken away and for us to live a different way in this country and so to wear that Sisto smile, to follow his example, to embrace that. I think this is the greatest tribute we can pay to him, but it also says to those who want to have none of this, and would have us live very differently, that we won\u2019t cop that and we will always live the way that we have the freedom to live in this country and you will never take that from us, you will never wipe that smile from our face, because we will always know that this is the greatest country on earth in which to live and the values and beliefs that enable it to be that great country, and the sacrifices that have been made from people to make it this great country are things that will always put a smile on our face and on those of our children. As the end of the year draws closer to us, so do all those end of year events \u2013 which include the annual cabinet document release. This year, we are up to 1996 and 1997. Which is John Howard\u2019s first year of government \u2013 and when Australia\u2019s gun laws were introduced and passed, following the Port Arthur massacre. Scott Morrison says he has been very touched by the stories he has been hearing about Sisto Malaspina, as the cafe, well, Melbourne institution he co-owned, re-opened following his death on Friday, in the Bourke Street terror attack. One day when the lady inside came in and she was feeling a bit blue, and he came over and he smiled at her, and he sung to her. How good is that? That is the heart of Melbourne ... The families who run these businesses, it is not a job, it is a passion. They are celebrating a life well lived. The ACCC has released its latest report on NBN speeds: Almost 4.5 million residents now have an NBN broadband connection at home, and nearly half of them are on fast plans with speeds of 50mbps or more, the latest ACCC quarterly Wholesale Market Indicators Report shows. The ACCC\u2019s report for the September quarter shows the number of NBN residential broadband connections rose from about 4.1 million last quarter (up almost 8.6%). More than 2.2 million consumers are now on these high-speed plans, an increase of 20% on the previous quarter. Of these, there are now 1.8 million services on the 50mbps speed tier, a more than a tenfold increase compared to about 159,000 residential customers on 50mbps plans in December 2017. Scott Morrison is in Melbourne, ahead of jetting off to Singapore. He\u2019s signing the condolence book for Sisto Malaspina, who was killed in Friday\u2019s attack, outside the cafe he co-owned. Matthew Guy is right behind him. Anne Aly was also on ABC radio this morning, expanding on what she meant when she criticised Scott Morrison\u2019s first comments following the Bourke Street terror attack. Can I just first of all, just take a pause to express unequivocally my condemnation of the terrorist attack last Friday and also send my condolences to the family and friends of those affected. Emma, my frustration is that in the wake of terrorist attacks we are presented with a very familiar refrain from our political leaders that calls on Muslim communities to do more, that calls on Muslim leaders to condemn terrorism again and again and again, even more louder, and I think that we need to move beyond words of condemnation. I think we need to move beyond these calls for the Muslim community which every law enforcement agency that I\u2019ve ever spoken to recognises is a very important ally in security. And move towards working towards an effective prevention and intervention \u2013 early intervention mechanism. And what would that look like? Years ago when I was a professor in counter-terrorism, there was a radical preacher by the name of Junaid Thorne operating in Perth\u2019s outer suburbs where he was trying to recruit young men. I spoke out against him, did a lot of media interviews against him, confronted him and confronted those young men who were being radicalised by him. The Muslim community here in Perth: teachers, imams, sheikhs, parents all banded together. They closed their doors to him, they prevented their sons from mingling with him, they reported his activities to the police. And together, working together, they effectively removed him from the streets of Perth. These are the kinds of things that we need to be doing. We need to be looking at how we can best generate community expertise, community intelligence, communities working together to eradicate terrorism from within our midst. So no problem in calling out extremist behaviour, Aly says, and she believes that to be important. Her main issue with the comments: I do take issue with calling out that behaviour by wholly and solely blaming an entire community and putting the responsibility of terrorism on an entire community. Kelly O\u2019Dwyer has been chatting about the gender pay gap. Spoiler \u2013 it still exists. You can\u2019t actually pay somebody more if you\u2019re doing exactly the same job, but there is certainly a national gender pay gap. Happily it\u2019s the lowest level it\u2019s been in 20 years at 14.5% but it\u2019s still too high. It\u2019s come down from 17.2% under the previous Labor government, but we certainly know that there is a gap between men and women and it\u2019s based on the fact that men and women can be paid different amounts in different industries in different jobs, and we know that it can often be because women are working part-time, not full-time, and they\u2019ve got caring responsibilities and don\u2019t necessarily get paid overtime because they don\u2019t have the capacity to take on that work. There are many reasons for it \u2013 and we are very fortunate to have the Workplace Gender Equality Agency that measures this. That\u2019s from her interview with ABC radio this morning. And it\u2019s because the Workplace Gender Equality Agency\u2019s latest report is out. You can read more about that, here. And those citizenship changes that are bubbling away, which we alerted you to yesterday? Well, they are still on the boil. There is not a lot of time for the government to actually do anything \u2013 there are two sitting weeks left and it no longer has its majority in the House, meaning it is highly unlikely any changes will be made in the short term. But it sounds to me as if the government is preparing an election policy; Senior Liberal minister Mathias Cormann was interviewed on ABC TV this morning, and was asked about Tim Fischer\u2019s criticism of ideologues in the Coalition who constantly criticise the ABC. Just to recap, former Nationals leader Tim Fischer on Monday said regional Australia \u201cwould be Siberia without the ABC\u201d and \u201cperhaps the ideological warriors should tone it down a bit\u201d. \u201c[They] should listen to all that the ABC, for its dynamic professionalism, is offering. I salute the ABC,\u201d he said. \u201cI could not live in and around Albury-Wodonga, Yackandandah, but for the ABC.\u201d Cormann was asked about Fischer\u2019s comments on Tuesday, and he said he had never criticised the ABC. \u201cI agree with him that the ABC has got a very important role and a very important responsibility in the public interest,\u201d he said. \u201cYou will find that personally I\u2019ve never ever criticised the ABC. I love the ABC. I appear on ABC outlets on regular occasions and I respect the job that you have as journalists. Go your hardest. \u201cFrom time to time, whether it is the ABC or any other media outlet, there can be questions raised in relation to accuracy of certain reports. Personally, I do not believe I\u2019ve queried an ABC story directly myself. I have certainly queried stories with other journalists in private sector outlets. \u201cSo there\u2019s nothing wrong with having a conversation about whether a particular report was accurate or not. In the broad, the ABC is a very important organisation and we recognise it as such.\u201d When Michael McCormack says \u201cthis is really going to help\u201d he means it is going to help Foodbank do the job they were already doing before the government, through the department, made the decision to cut the key staples program funding. Three years ago, Foodbank was running this program with about $1.5m in funding. The $323,000 cut would have been the third cut it had been asked to absorb and reduced its funding, for this program, to just under $500,000. The decision to reverse the latest cut means it\u2019s back to $750,000 a year, for 4.5 years. That \u201cbig stick\u201d the government has been talking about when it comes to energy companies? Turns out it might be the high court which decides whether or not the government can use it. As Katharine Murphy reports: Australia\u2019s major electricity companies have raised questions about whether the Morrison government has the legal authority to proceed with its so-called \u201cbig stick\u201d threat to break up companies for price gouging, and to impose the regulation of power prices. The commercial law firm Ashurst has provided advice to the Australian Energy Council, which represents 22 major electricity and gas firms, saying there are concerns about the \u201cframing and constitutionality\u201d of the Morrison government\u2019s measures intended to force price relief for consumers and business. The legal advice revealed on Tuesday says if the government intends to proceed with what amounts to \u201cquasi-judicial\u201d interventions, such as imposing price regulation, requiring generators to contract with third parties, and forcing divestment, then the power should be exercised independently of ministers \u201cso that the decision-making process is not influenced by the potential for political interference, or the appearance of political interference\u201d. You can read the rest of that report, here. Paul Fletcher ended yesterday by promising to look into \u201ctransitional\u201d funding for Foodbank, as well as why the organisation was given just six weeks\u2019 notice of the decision to cut $323,000 from its funding. This morning he has announced an increase to the amount of money allocated for food relief funding. From his statement: The Liberal National Government will increase funding for food relief by $1.485 million over the next 4.5 years, to $5.985 million. This decision means that Foodbank\u2019s funding will be maintained at $750,000 per year over the next 4.5 years, with Second Bite and OzHarvest to be funded as announced last week. The extra funding will enable a stronger focus on drought relief, while continuing existing service levels around Australia. I will be inviting the CEOs of Foodbank, Second Bite and OzHarvest to meet with me in a roundtable discussion in coming days to allow us to finalise the arrangements and co-ordinate a continuing collaborative approach to food relief. This additional funding will be sourced within existing resources of the Department of Social Services. The Government looks forward to working closely with Foodbank, Second Bite and OzHarvest to maximise the benefit of the vital food relief services they provide for vulnerable and homeless Australians. Well, after 24 hours of criticism from everyone from the National Farmers\u2019 Federation, to Jimmy Barnes, Labor and Kochie, the government has decided to reverse its funding cut to Foodbank\u2019s Key Staples program. Just before leaving for Singapore, Scott Morrison intervened to ask for the issue to be fixed. Paul Fletcher has responded by boosting the funding for food relief by $1.485m over the next four and a half years, bringing the total budget to $5.985m. That means no one gets cut and a third provider is funded. It\u2019s a problem which didn\u2019t need to be created. While there was a tender process, and while OzHarvest, the third provider chosen, does do excellent work, it does a different job to the one Foodbank provides, so cutting one to pay for the other was a pretty shortsighted decision, especially when we are talking about the small amounts of money (for a national budget) we are seeing here. So good to see common sense won out. Elsewhere, the Senate is still sitting, as it continues its solo week, but it will most likely be action outside the chamber that captures attention. Summit season has officially began, which I think makes Michael McCormack our acting prime minister. Morrison has Singapore, then PNG, then Argentina, as well as two more parliament sessions, but the domestic issues keep ticking over as well. We\u2019ll keep you abreast of all of them. You\u2019ve got Mike Bowers behind the lens and the Guardian brain\u2019s trust on the job. I\u2019ve got my second coffee. So we are all good. Ready? Let\u2019s get into it.",

          "body": "<p>Six weeks after Jamal Khashoggi was murdered by Saudi agents, the decision-making process in Riyadh is slowly starting to change. Fallout from the assassination in Istanbul has wounded Mohammed bin Salman, the heir to the throne, and given a second wind to an old guard of elders, whose views are once more being heard.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/12/uk-jeremy-hunt-pressure-saudi-arabia-khashoggi-killing\">UK piles pressure on Saudi Arabia over Khashoggi killing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Publicly, the kingdom\u2019s leaders appear chastened and contrite in the wake of Khashoggi\u2019s gruesome killing inside the Saudi consulate. In private though, senior members of the House of Saud, including the crown prince, are partly blaming Turkey for the global revulsion, which they say could have been contained if Ankara had played by \u201cregional rules\u201d.</p> <p>Central to the resentment, according to sources close to the royal court in Riyadh, is a view that the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, betrayed the kingdom by disclosing details of the investigation and refusing all overtures from Saudi envoys, including an offer to pay \u201csignificant\u201d compensation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"68a77145d4b93a41f6808634dec3469a57231c5d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/68a77145d4b93a41f6808634dec3469a57231c5d/909_0_1556_934/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christophe Petit-Tesson/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThey say they were betrayed by the Turks,\u201d a regional source said. \u201cThat\u2019s where they are in their most private thoughts.\u201d</p> <p>The extraordinary ramifications of Khashoggi\u2019s death continue to reverberate through the halls of power in Riyadh, where some decisions are now being made away from the ubiquitous crown prince, who Turkey alleges directly ordered the assassination, and has since tried to deflect blame to fall guys, including his most prominent domestic aide. Ankara has been aiming to isolate Prince Mohammed through weeks of pointed rhetoric that has appealed to the Saudi king to rein in his son, and restore more conventional ways of doing business.</p> <p>The return to Riyadh earlier this month of Ahmed bin Abdulaziz, the sole surviving full brother of King Salman, has been widely interpreted as a first step in the restoration of an old order, in which decision making was made after extensive consultation among elders. Another senior figure, Khalid al-Faisal, led the Saudi delegation to meet Erdo\u011fan in October, and the king himself - who has taken more of a chairman role since appointing Prince Mohammed as his heir - has been more visible and vocal in meetings, a second senior source says.</p> <p>\u201cMbS [the common acronym for the crown prince] has had his wings clipped,\u201d the source said. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt about it. He doesn\u2019t have the same swagger, and he\u2019s just as scared of a mis-step as the next guy. That\u2019s a big change.\u201d</p> <p>In the days after Khashoggi was killed, as the official Saudi reaction shifted from outright denial that it had played a role, to a begrudging admission that Khashoggi had been killed in a fight, Prince Mohammed struggled to comprehend the scale of the reaction \u2013 and even the reason for it.</p> <p>\u201cHe was blaming the Americans for betraying him initially,\u201d said the regional source. \u201cHe\u2019d seen Abu Ghraib, renditions, death penalties, and he felt comforted by Trump.

          "bodyText": "Six weeks after Jamal Khashoggi was murdered by Saudi agents, the decision-making process in Riyadh is slowly starting to change. Fallout from the assassination in Istanbul has wounded Mohammed bin Salman, the heir to the throne, and given a second wind to an old guard of elders, whose views are once more being heard. Publicly, the kingdom\u2019s leaders appear chastened and contrite in the wake of Khashoggi\u2019s gruesome killing inside the Saudi consulate. In private though, senior members of the House of Saud, including the crown prince, are partly blaming Turkey for the global revulsion, which they say could have been contained if Ankara had played by \u201cregional rules\u201d. Central to the resentment, according to sources close to the royal court in Riyadh, is a view that the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, betrayed the kingdom by disclosing details of the investigation and refusing all overtures from Saudi envoys, including an offer to pay \u201csignificant\u201d compensation. \u201cThey say they were betrayed by the Turks,\u201d a regional source said. \u201cThat\u2019s where they are in their most private thoughts.\u201d The extraordinary ramifications of Khashoggi\u2019s death continue to reverberate through the halls of power in Riyadh, where some decisions are now being made away from the ubiquitous crown prince, who Turkey alleges directly ordered the assassination, and has since tried to deflect blame to fall guys, including his most prominent domestic aide. Ankara has been aiming to isolate Prince Mohammed through weeks of pointed rhetoric that has appealed to the Saudi king to rein in his son, and restore more conventional ways of doing business. The return to Riyadh earlier this month of Ahmed bin Abdulaziz, the sole surviving full brother of King Salman, has been widely interpreted as a first step in the restoration of an old order, in which decision making was made after extensive consultation among elders. Another senior figure, Khalid al-Faisal, led the Saudi delegation to meet Erdo\u011fan in October, and the king himself - who has taken more of a chairman role since appointing Prince Mohammed as his heir - has been more visible and vocal in meetings, a second senior source says. \u201cMbS [the common acronym for the crown prince] has had his wings clipped,\u201d the source said. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt about it. He doesn\u2019t have the same swagger, and he\u2019s just as scared of a mis-step as the next guy. That\u2019s a big change.\u201d In the days after Khashoggi was killed, as the official Saudi reaction shifted from outright denial that it had played a role, to a begrudging admission that Khashoggi had been killed in a fight, Prince Mohammed struggled to comprehend the scale of the reaction \u2013 and even the reason for it. \u201cHe was blaming the Americans for betraying him initially,\u201d said the regional source. \u201cHe\u2019d seen Abu Ghraib, renditions, death penalties, and he felt comforted by Trump. He could not understand why this was happening to him.\u201d Since then, western leaders\u2019 once enthusiastic embrace of Prince Mohammed has been replaced by wariness and a view that some of the regional feuds launched in his name need to be brought to an end. \u201cWe saw [the US secretary of state Mike] Pompeo talk strongly about Yemen,\u201d said a British diplomat, who like other senior officials contacted by the Guardian, declined to be named. \u201cThat was not a \u2018we\u2019re working with you\u2019 tone. It was something very different.\u201d Pompeo on 31 October had demanded a 30-day ceasefire in Yemen, where Saudi-led forces had been fighting Houthi rebel groups, who it alleges are backed by Iran. The US defence secretary, James Mattis, added his voice on Friday, and urged the start of peace talks between Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Iran. They were the strongest remarks yet by a US official in the two-year war on the kingdom\u2019s eastern border. Also on Friday, the US said it would no longer refuel Saudi fighter jets conducting missions in Yemen \u2013 a further sign that Riyadh\u2019s most important ally, and supplier of most of its weapons, is losing faith in the campaign. The Saudi-led blockade of Qatar is also facing renewed scrutiny, with US officials believed to be newly energised in finding ways to force a climbdown which would not further diminish Prince Mohammed in the eyes of his critics or domestic stakeholders. There is little appetite in London or Washington for Prince Mohammed to be removed, and Ankara \u2013 which is strongly opposed to the crown prince, but not at odds with King Salman \u2013 is being lobbied heavily by Riyadh\u2019s allies to accept the fact that Prince Mohammed will not be ousted. A Whitehall assessment is that a risk exists of a slide back towards the religious establishment, revocation of social change and a plunge in the Saudi economy if a palace coup was launched. \u201cIt\u2019s in everyone\u2019s interests to find a way forward that world leaders can just about live with,\u201d an official with responsibility for Saudi security policy said.

The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, said he had given recordings \u201cto Saudi Arabia, to America, to the Germans, the French, to the British, to all of them\u201d, but initially there was no independent confirmation from any country that they had heard it. Speaking at a press conference in Paris, where he attended a peace forum after armistice ceremonies, Trudeau said Canadian intelligence had listened to the audio tape provided by Turkish intelligence, but he had not done so. \u201cCanada\u2019s intelligence agencies have been working very closely on this issue with Turkish intelligence and Canada has been fully briefed on what Turkey had to share,\u201d he said. \u201cI had a conversation with Erdo\u011fan a couple of weeks ago, and here in Paris we had brief exchanges and I thanked him for his strength in responding to the Khashoggi situation.\u201d In contrast, the French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, said recordings related to Khashoggi\u2019s murder were not to his knowledge in France\u2019s possession, directly contradicting Erdo\u011fan.

Turkey said the French remarks were unacceptable and not a reflection of the facts. \u201cLet us not forget that this case would have been already covered up had it not been for Turkey\u2019s determined efforts,\u201d said Fahrettin Altun, the Turkish presidency communications director. It is thought the British officials have listened to a tape, but not been given possession of it, a state of affairs that would square with Le Drian\u2019s claim that France does not possess the tape. Altun said: \u201cI confirm that evidence pertaining to the Khashoggi murder has also been shared with the relevant agencies of the French government.\u201d A representative of French intelligence listened to the audio recording and detailed information including a transcript on October 24, he added. \u201cIf there is miscommunication between the French government\u2019s various agencies, it is up to the French authorities \u2014 not Turkey \u2014 to take care of that problem.\u201d Steffen Seibert, the spokesman for the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, was asked about the existence of a tape and said: \u201c I can tell you that there has been an exchange of intelligence service information on that.\u201d He declined to give any further details.

          "bodyText": "The health secretary, Matt Hancock, is to meet the French president, Emmanuel Macron, the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, and other world leaders at a summit on new technologies that could revolutionise health and social care. The minister will champion the UK\u2019s genomics, life sciences and artificial intelligence programmes as he addresses the GovTech summit in Paris on Monday about how innovation can transform patients\u2019 lives. \u201cI\u2019ve said I\u2019ll scour the world to find technology to improve the NHS. So as we build the most dynamic healthtech ecosystem on the planet, it\u2019s vital we work closely with our friends and neighbours,\u201d Hancock will say. \u201cBritain and France have a centuries-long tradition of medical collaboration and now we want to turn that into a collaboration on cutting-edge health technology.\u201d Hancock previously revealed ministers were considering a new levy on over-40s, similar to measures introduced in Japan and Germany where a compulsory premium is deducted from earnings, to help solve the social care funding crisis. The so-called govtech industry has grown at a rate of 20% a year in the UK alone. The Cabinet Office plans to publish an innovation strategy setting out how the government can use emerging technologies to deliver public services. The implementation minister, Oliver Dowden, said: \u201cBritain is a global leader in digital innovation, with some of the best technology companies in the world operating in this country. We are keen to build on that, learning from best practice, both in the UK and overseas, to ensure we deliver the best possible public services\u201d. The inaugural summit will be attended by EU ministers and UN representatives, as well academics, large tech companies such as Facebook and Microsoft and smaller startups. Daniel Korski, a former adviser to David Cameron and chair of the summit, will say: \u201cIf you look at the exponential growth we\u2019ve seen in other sectors, and consider the growing demands of ageing populations and increasing demands of citizens, it\u2019s not so crazy to imagine govtech becoming the next big digital sector very soon.\u201d",

Pence actually has a bit of status around here, apparently he played a role in getting the old King James Bible into the country as a gift to the national parliament.\u201d</p> <p>But the real love-fest of the summit is likely to be between PNG and China.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s already going to be the China show,\u201d said Pryke. \u201cXi\u2019s going for a long time \u2026 and he\u2019s hosting a meeting with the Pacific Island leaders on the sideline of the leaders meeting and I imagine there will be a lot of big announcements \u2013 more investment, more aid.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018The toothpaste is out of the tube\u2019</h2> <p>China has already indicated its intentions to partner closely with the country, pledging <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/08/huge-increase-in-chinese-aid-pledged-to-pacific\">to give the nation $3.94bn</a> in aid and loan projects last year.

          "bodyText": "It is likely to end, as all Apec leaders summits do, with world leaders, including Xi Jinping, Mike Pence, Shinzo Abe, Justin Trudeau and Australian prime minister Scott Morrison, donning matching shirts and posing awkwardly for a photo op. But this week world leaders will arrive in Port Moresby, the capital of Papua New Guinea, for an Apec unlike any other. This is the first time Papua New Guinea, the poorest country among the 21 countries of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) bloc, has hosted the summit. PNG ranks around 130th worldwide for GDP and 135th in the corruption perception index, and Port Moresby is consistently ranked one of the most dangerous cities in the world, which could be the reason that at least one leader \u2013 Mike Pence \u2013 will not be staying in the host country, but will be flying in and out from the Australian city of Cairns. The PNG government hopes that the nation will emerge with trade agreements and a new standing on the world stage, but the the arrival of thousands of people will test the country. The road to Apec has been a rocky and unconventional one, involving three cruise ships, 40 Maseratis and Hillary Clinton. Clinton, in fact, is where it all started, says Jonathan Pryke, director of the Pacific Islands program for the Lowy Institute, a Sydney thinktank. \u201cEveryone has a different story about how [Apec ended up in PNG],\u201d he said. \u2018We\u2019re sick of people thinking we\u2019re in Africa\u2019 One story commonly told in Australian diplomatic circles is that the idea was first floated by the former US secretary for state in 2012 when she attended the Pacific Island Leaders Forum. A senior diplomatic figure familiar with the negotiations said while Clinton might have been keen, her government and the Australian government were not. \u201cThere were a lot of reservations and a lot of concerns about logistical capacity ... I recall a lot of dialogue between Washington and Canberra about it: can they really pull this off?\u201d What is not in question is that the Papua New Guinean government wanted to host Apec. \u201cI think it\u2019s about narrative and legacy and encouraging Papua New Guineans to take a pride in themselves and their country,\u201d said Ian Kemish, former Australian high commissioner to PNG. \u201cClearly you\u2019ve just got to look at [prime minister Peter O\u2019Neill\u2019s] public comments to see that he also wants to use it as an opportunity, almost as a lever, to bring in investment to the country and to bring off some key announcements, particularly in the resource sector.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll hear PNG officials say \u2018we\u2019re sick of people thinking we\u2019re in Africa, we want to be on the map,\u2019\u201d said Pryke. \u201c[Apec] is a big PR pitch and they do need to and want to diversify their economy. There\u2019s a lot of noble ambition to what they want Apec to achieve.\u201d It was announced that PNG would host the summit in 2013, at a time the outlook for the country was bright, owing to a construction boom as a huge LNG project in the highlands of the country was being built. \u201cGDP growth for that year in PNG was among the highest anywhere in the world, it was booming,\u201d said Pryke. If PNG\u2019s economy had followed the trajectory it seemed to be set on, then hosting Apec in 2018 could have been exactly what the country needed: a moment to announce itself on the world stage and an opportunity to promote private sector investment. However, just as the LNG facility was supposed to come online, the oil price plummeted. Since then a litany of problems have played out in the country, including an outbreak of polio, as well as sharp rises in the incidence of malaria and tuberculosis \u2013 and a struggling economy. Maseratis, cruise liners and \u2018the China show\u2019 Spending on Apec has been met with widespread anger across the country, culminating in Maserati-gate in October, after it was revealed the government had purchased 40 Maseratis and three luxury Bentleys for the summit. Diplomatic sources told Reuters that nearly all leaders attending the event would travel in special armoured vehicles, making it unclear what the sports cars will be used for. \u201cThere are a lot of people, not just in Port Moresby but around PNG who are outraged by the spending on Apec which seems to be extravagant,\u201d said Martyn Namorong, a writer and activist in Port Moresby. \u201cMany people feel it\u2019s not been clearly articulated to them what the benefits of Apec will be.\u201d The challenges of hosting Apec are significant. Alan Bollard, executive director of the Apec Secretariat estimates 5,000-7,000 people are expected to arrive in Port Moresby this week. Because of a lack of hotel rooms, the city has had to contract three cruise ships to be used as floating accommodation for media and other attendees. The US will be represented at the summit by Mike Pence who will not be staying in PNG, but will fly in from Cairns in Australia. He is the only leader confirmed not to be staying in PNG, but there are rumours other leaders may do the same. \u201cIt\u2019s not a great look,\u201d said Pryke of the US vice-president\u2019s decision not to stay in the host country. While Pence\u2019s short visit may offend, the fact that he, and not Donald Trump, is going to Apec is unlikely to ruffle feathers. \u201cPeople are being fairly philosophical about it,\u201d said Kemish. \u201cIt\u2019s not the first time a US president hasn\u2019t been to Apec. Pence actually has a bit of status around here, apparently he played a role in getting the old King James Bible into the country as a gift to the national parliament.\u201d But the real love-fest of the summit is likely to be between PNG and China. \u201cIt\u2019s already going to be the China show,\u201d said Pryke. \u201cXi\u2019s going for a long time \u2026 and he\u2019s hosting a meeting with the Pacific Island leaders on the sideline of the leaders meeting and I imagine there will be a lot of big announcements \u2013 more investment, more aid.\u201d \u2018The toothpaste is out of the tube\u2019 China has already indicated its intentions to partner closely with the country, pledging to give the nation $3.94bn in aid and loan projects last year. This has concerned Australia, traditionally PNG\u2019s closest partner. In the week before Apec, the Australian government announced AU$3bn in additional funding to the Pacific, which was widely seen as a move to counter China\u2019s growing influence in the region. China provided significant infrastructure support to PNG ahead of Apec and Australia has contributed at least AU$130m, largely in the area of security. Diplomatic sources say this was something Australia was keen to do, particularly in order to keep the Chinese military out of PNG, which at its closest point is just 4km from Australia. Commentators are unanimous that for Apec to be a success requires more than just an incident-free summit. \u201cPNG has an opportunity to drive forward a range of significant economic projects and send a message to the international investor community that it is competitive and truly part of the global community,\u201d said Kemish. \u201cThere\u2019s no turning back now, the toothpaste is out of the tube,\u201d said Pryke. \u201cIt\u2019s in everyone\u2019s interests for this to be a success, however you want to define it, and also for it just to be done. It has been a huge distraction, both financially and on the bureaucracy.\u201d",

          "bodyText": "If the British empire\u2019s dead of the first world war had marched four abreast down Whitehall, the founder of the Imperial War Graves Commission, Sir Fabian Ware, observed some years afterwards, it would have taken them three and a half days, walking day and night, to pass the Cenotaph. On Sunday, a century after the first world war was finally brought to an end, the Queen, Britain\u2019s political and military leaders and tens of thousands of veterans and members of the public gathered once again in central London to pay their respects to them and the war\u2019s many millions of other casualties, the vast scale of its waste no easier to comprehend now than it was at its conclusion. At the stroke of 11am, the time the armistice signed by the allied powers and Germany came into effect a century earlier, the dense crowds packed into Whitehall fell absolutely still to observe the two minutes\u2019 silence. Prince Charles then laid a wreath on the Cenotaph steps on behalf of the Queen, who at 92, was watching from a nearby balcony. He was followed by the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the first time a representative of Britain\u2019s former foe had taken part in the national service of remembrance. Later, Steinmeier joined the Queen and other royals at a remembrance service at Westminster Abbey where the Dean of Westminster, Dr John Hall, prayed for a time when conflict was \u201ctransformed into friendship and collaboration\u201d. The ceremonies in London were echoed in countless acts of commemoration, large and small, in Britain and across the world, reflecting the extent of hostilities that claimed 40 million military and civilian casualties worldwide. Global commemorations centred on France, the crucible of much of the conflict, where more than 60 heads of state and government gathered at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. As well as a monument to Napoleonic victories, it is also contains the grave of an unknown soldier of the first world war. Among those joining the French president, Emmanuel Macron, were Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, Angela Merkel and Leo Varadkar. In pouring rain, most heads of state arrived in coaches driven up the Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es from the presidential palace. They then walked slowly together in a snaking line under black umbrellas to the Arc de Triomphe, Merkel beside Macron, Justin Trudeau next to Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. The image of leaders walking together through the rain was described by French commentators as a moving gesture of peace, but there were two notable absentees, both Trump and Putin arriving separately with their own security details. Macron\u2019s speech, in turn, was pointedly political, warning that \u201cold demons\u201d were resurfacing that threatened the fragile peace and highlighting the dangers of countries putting their own national interests first. Patriotism, he said, \u201cis the exact opposite of nationalism. Nationalism is a betrayal of patriotism. In saying, \u2018our interests first, whatever happens to the others\u2019 you erase the most precious thing a nation can have, that which makes it live, that which causes it to be great and that which is most important: its moral values.\u201d Trump, who said recently he was proud to be a nationalist, looked on without visible reaction. Theresa May was absent from the French commemorations. The prime minister opted to send Cabinet Office minister, David Lidington, to Paris, as she stayed in London to lay a wreath at the Cenotaph as usual alongside the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and other political and military leaders and senior royals. As well as the massed ranks of current and former members of the military, the parade past the Cenotaph was joined this year by a \u201cpeople\u2019s procession\u201d of 10,000 members of the public who were allocated tickets in a ballot to join the march, in an initiative described by the government as \u201ca nation\u2019s thank you\u201d.

The town, the Lord-Lieutenant for County Fermanagh Viscount Brookborough said in his oration, was the first place to hear news of the armistice, after a local radio operator had heard and translated a message in Morse code transmitted from Paris. Some of the most dramatic and moving tributes were those traced on to 30 beaches stretching from Shetland to Cornwall, in which large-scale portraits and smaller silhouettes of local soldiers were drawn on the sand, before the tide slowly rose to wash all traces away. The Pages of the Sea project had been devised by the film-maker Danny Boyle as a less formal gesture of remembrance, and as morning broke through the gloom in Blackpool, small groups of people, some with young children, gathered to lend a hand and pay their personal respects. A single white rose was placed on the sand portrait of L/Cpl John Edward Arkwright, who landed in France with the 1st Battalion, King\u2019s Own Royal Lancaster Regiment on 23 August 1914, and was killed three days later during the battle of Le Cateau, at the age of 23.

President-elect Michael D Higgins has attended the Armistice Day centenary commemorations at Dublin\u2019s Glasnevin Cemetery to pay tribute to the memory of the Irish men and women who died in the first world war. </p> \n  <p>In his speech he said that the events were not a \u201ccelebration of militarism\u201d, before going on to criticise how some nations today \u201cseek to embark upon a new arms race\u201d which serves to \u201cfuel fires of war in other lands\u201d.</p> \n  <p>\u201cOurs is not a celebration of militarism, nor a valorisation of martial spirit, but a simple recognition of our common humanity, as we recall the destruction of the promise and potential of a generation in the First World War, the lasting damage inflicted on the millions wounded and maimed, and the countless others who would go on to suffer mental anguish as a result of the horrors of their war experience,\u201d he said, noting that 200,000 Irish men served overseas. </p> \n  <p>\u201cDespite all the differences of religion, class and political aspiration, they were united by what would be a shared experience of war, with its comradeship, friendship and shared hardship whether it was on the Western Front, at Gallipoli, or in the Middle East.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Higgins added that the world today had \u201cthe material capacity to abolish all forms of human poverty, to alleviate all unnecessary suffering, we are still devoting so much of our creativity, not to the preservation or achievement of peace, but to the prosecution of and preparation for war\u201d.</p> \n  <p> \u201cAmidst great human suffering, some nations now seek to embark upon a new arms race, increasing not only their own stockpiles, but exporting weapons of death and destruction to fuel the fires of war in other lands, in Yemen, in Syria, and in the Democratic Republic of Congo,\u201d he said. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\"

We have roundups from Belgium, France, the UK and from around the world if you would like to read more about events today. Thank you for joining us. Donald Trump, who missed yesterday\u2019s cemetery visit in Compi\u00e8gne, northern France, amid heavy rain, has described today\u2019s ceremony in Paris as \u201cbeautiful\u201d. Here we have a gallery with photographs from commemorations around the world: Members of the emergency services around the country have been paying their respects. Britain\u2019s oldest person shares her memories of the celebrations on Armistice Day. The procession has now passed Nelson\u2019s column and the Women in War memorial. Donald Trump, Angela Merkel and Vladimir Putin join Emmanuel Macron and other world leaders in a Paris ceremony to mark the 100th anniversary of the armistice that brought an end to the first world war. There\u2019s more here. And here\u2019s our round up of commemorations around the world: Up to 10,000 veterans, serving personnel and members of the public marked the centenary of the Armistice at the National Memorial Arboretum, Alrewas, Staffordshire. Remembering those who gave their lives, the reverend Tim Flowers, assistant chaplain of the arboretum, said theirs had been a sacrifice for future generations \u201cthat all people may together live in freedom, justice and peace\u201d. Then five buglers of the Royal Marines played the last post, as the two-minute silence fell. Reveille sounded and then, as sea cadet Eleanor Deeley read the Kohima Epitaph, a sudden gust of wind blew up, rustling the trees which cover the vast site. As the final notes of the bugle call drifted away, the only noise that could be heard above the silence was the wind in the trees. The crowd lent full voice to the hymn Abide With Me while earlier the Band of the Royal Marines had played the Band of Brothers television theme \u2013 Requiem for a Soldier \u2013 and the hymn Amazing Grace. There was then a wreath-laying led by the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester, before families left flowers for their loved ones and relatives who were lost to the Great War and other conflicts. A card fixed to the poppies, read: \u201cWe never knew you but we know of you \u2013 we will never forget your selfless sacrifice. Thank you.\u201d Earlier today the President of Germany, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, laid a wreath at the cenotaph in a highly symbolic moment, the first time the German head of state has done so, in a historic moment of reconciliation. Acts of remembrance are also taking place across Northern Ireland with DUP leader Arlene Foster and Irish government minister Heather Humphreys laying wreaths at the cenotaph in Enniskillen. Hundreds gathered in the narrow streets to watch a musical procession including a brass band and bagpipes before representatives of the four main churches in the town led a service. Remembrance Sunday in the Co Fermanagh town has an added poignancy after a Provisional IRA bomb devastated the event in 1987. Eleven people were killed in the blast. A 12th victim, Ronnie Hill, slipped into a coma two days afterwards and died 13 years later. A number of families of the bomb victims were present in Enniskillen for the ceremony. Armistice commemorations started before dawn in the town \u2013 which is among the most westerly in the United Kingdom \u2013 with a lone piper playing at an event at Enniskillen Castle at 6am. Representatives of all the main churches and the armed forces were present, as well as Northern Ireland secretary Karen Bradley, Ireland\u2019s deputy premier Simon Coveney and police service of Northern Ireland deputy chief constable Stephen Martin. Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s Belfast Lord Mayor Deirdre Hargey was not in attendance. A party spokesman said that its representatives will not take part in events which \u201ccelebrate or attempt to legitimise British imperialism\u201d. Coveney was not present at the service due to the inauguration of Michael D Higgins for his second term as Irish president in Dublin. In a letter published in the order of service, he said: \u201cFor far too long, remembrance of the war on the island was a source of division. There was a sense that commemoration of the young Irishmen who died in the Somme or Gallipoli was a political declaration, or a marker of community identity. \u201cIn recent times, and as we have marked the centenaries of the events of that decade, we have seen something very different. We have seen leadership and scholarship and sensitivity and generosity.\u201d The European Broadcasting Union, which operates Eurovision and Euroradio, will be holding a concert for peace at 2.30pm which shall be broadcasted live to audiences around the world to commemorate the centenary. Derek Gregory aged 88 from Sidnouth, Devon, was holding his father\u2019s medals from WW1. His father was Albert James Gregory who served with the South Wales Borderers in France where he was gassed, causing him to suffer from health problems in later life. In disgust at the lack of welfare assistance available on his return from the war, he threw his medals in the coal hole from where his wife later managed to retrieve two of them. Today they are mounted and in frame. \u201cI think it\u2019s wonderful,\u201d said Derek at the People\u2019s Procession, accompanied by his daughter Lorraine Frost. \u201cI think they should do it every year ... It would be unforgivable if it all just faded away.\u201d Derek\u2019s newborn great-grandson has been named Albert in his father\u2019s memory. The Irish President-elect Michael D Higgins has attended the Armistice Day centenary commemorations at Dublin\u2019s Glasnevin Cemetery to pay tribute to the memory of the Irish men and women who died in the first world war. In his speech he said that the events were not a \u201ccelebration of militarism\u201d, before going on to criticise how some nations today \u201cseek to embark upon a new arms race\u201d which serves to \u201cfuel fires of war in other lands\u201d. \u201cOurs is not a celebration of militarism, nor a valorisation of martial spirit, but a simple recognition of our common humanity, as we recall the destruction of the promise and potential of a generation in the First World War, the lasting damage inflicted on the millions wounded and maimed, and the countless others who would go on to suffer mental anguish as a result of the horrors of their war experience,\u201d he said, noting that 200,000 Irish men served overseas. \u201cDespite all the differences of religion, class and political aspiration, they were united by what would be a shared experience of war, with its comradeship, friendship and shared hardship whether it was on the Western Front, at Gallipoli, or in the Middle East.\u201d Higgins added that the world today had \u201cthe material capacity to abolish all forms of human poverty, to alleviate all unnecessary suffering, we are still devoting so much of our creativity, not to the preservation or achievement of peace, but to the prosecution of and preparation for war\u201d. \u201cAmidst great human suffering, some nations now seek to embark upon a new arms race, increasing not only their own stockpiles, but exporting weapons of death and destruction to fuel the fires of war in other lands, in Yemen, in Syria, and in the Democratic Republic of Congo,\u201d he said. More than 47 countries were represented at the service, and officials laid wreaths at the Irish military plot, before the last post was played and the Irish flag returned to full mast. Poetry from the first world war was read by the British, French and German ambassadors to Ireland, before prayer and a minute of silence. The commemoration took place at 9am, hours before Higgins was to be inaugurated for his second term as President of Ireland. The prime minister Theresa May and the leader of the opposition Jeremy Corbyn have laid wreaths during the service of remembrance at the Cenotaph on Whitehall. Thousands of marchers have begun leaving the Mall in central London in a people\u2019s procession that will bring people from across the country together as they pass the Cenotaph in what has been described as the \u201cnation\u2019s thank you\u201d to all those who fought in the first world war. Marion Lewis and her sister Dorothy Heslop are marching for their grandfather, Private John Waters of the 23rd Battalion Middlesex Regiment. He received a serious head wound at the Somme in October 1916 which left him missing part of his skull. Eighteen people were killed, 11 were missing and 29 wounded from his battalion in the same action. As girls, it was an unspoken rule not to ask granddad about the war, they said. \u201cThey did not expect him to survive so they left him outside the medical tent and we think it\u2019s the cold that probably saved him,\u201d Heslop said. Events are taking place across Belgium starting with a ceremony at the Belgian monument in Brussels attended by King Philippe who will later attend a last post ceremony in Ypres at 8pm. The size of the crowds in Ypres for the last post ceremony on Friday night and the special ceremony on Saturday morning \u2013 \u201cat the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month\u201d \u2013 were said by Benoit Mottrie, chairman of the last post association, the 24-strong voluntary organisation whose buglers have remembered the fallen at the setting of the sun every day at the gate for 90 years, to have been the largest he could recall. A parade in the morning through the town included the band of the Devon and Somerset fire brigade, who will be performing at a concert in the main square this afternoon. Meanwhile in Mons, south-west Belgium, George Barkhouse, the great-nephew of Pte George Lawrence Price, a Canadian believed to have been the last British empire soldier killed in the war, is attending a liberation parade involving troops from Canada. It was there that the 25-year-old was shot in the heart by a sniper, as he tried to move civilians out of a group of houses occupied by a German troops. He was tended to by a Belgian nurse but died a minute later in her care. It was 10.58am. \u201cHe was engaged to be married. It is so important I am here,\u201d Barkshouse, 89, told the Guardian. \u201cImportant to mark how my great-uncle has been honoured as the last man. We talk about him a lot in the family. We remember him.\u201d As Leigh Todd walks in the People\u2019s Procession she will remember her great-aunt Nancy Allen, one of countless women who lost their fianc\u00e9s and the future they had planned to the Great War. \u201cShe was 21 and she had just got engaged. And then he was called up,\u201d said Leigh, from Scarborough, walking with her husband Richard. \u201cThe effect it had on her. After he was killed she never married. She never had children. Her life was spent looking after her parents. \u201cShe never stopped wearing black and she kept the letters that he wrote to her in a chocolate tin. \u201cYou don\u2019t really think of these women. All the men were away. She lived in a pit village, Wheatley Hill, so I imagine there was nothing for her. There was no future.\u201d The couple, who have three children \u2013 the youngest aged 14 \u2013 always commemorate Remembrance Sunday. \u201cWe\u2019ve brought the children up to think it is a very important day,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it is brilliant that the descendants can be part of this centenary. I\u2019m feeling really emotional being part of it.\u201d Away from the big commemorations, today has a particular resonance in places like the Australian town of Gundagai in New South Wales, which suffered unimaginable losses in the first world war. Naaman Zhou has filed this piece on how the grief \u2013 and names of those killed \u2013 live on. Under a light-grey sky, eight buglers in greatcoats sounded the Last post. Silence fell among the many thousands gathered at Ypres\u2019 Menin Gate, as Europe remembered the 100th anniversary of the end of the first world war \u201cat the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month\u201d. At the Gate\u2019s inauguration after the war, a long line of ashen-faced mothers struggling to hold back the anguish, and fathers marching sternly with trembling lips, had snaked through this flattened town up to and under the gate. Blinded veterans had run their fingers over the newly carved bone-white Portland stone to feel out some of the names of fellow soldiers who had lost their lives, and whose bodies had never been found. \u201cA more sacred place for the British does not exist in the world,\u201d the then secretary of state for war, Winston Churchill, had intoned. Today, at what will surely be the last great act of remembrance of the great war here, at least for the sons, daughters, nieces and nephews of those who served and sacrificed in Ypres, a commitment was renewed to learn the lessons of the past in defiance at the fading in living memory of what happened on Flanders\u2019 fields. (read on) In his armistice speech to world leaders including America\u2019s Trump and Russia\u2019s Putin at the Arc de Triomphe, Emmanuel Macron warned against the rise of nationalism. He said he was a patriot but \u201cpatriotism is the exact opposite of nationalism\u201d. Suggesting that that nationalism and egotism was once again on the rise, he said: \u201cOld demons are resurfacing. History sometimes threatens to take its tragic course again and compromise our hope of peace. Let us vow to prioritise peace over everything.\u201d He said the traces of the first world war had never been erased from Europe nor the Middle East and called on countries to stand together in \u201cgood will\u201d - to \u201cjoin our hopes together\u201d rather than face-off because of our \u201cfears\u201d. He said countries needed to join to fight new challenges such as climate change, poverty, famine and inequality. The focus of this blog for the last little while has been on London and Paris, but it\u2019s worth remembering that there are homes across the globe where families have been touched by the conflicts being marked by today\u2019s events. Kate Nicholl\u2019s great-grandfather John Waugh was killed in action aged 28 in Flanders just two weeks before the armistice. \u201cWhich makes it seem doubly senseless,\u201d she said. He had been shell-shocked and was very traumatised but still had to fight. As she joined the People\u2019s Procession she was also remembering her great-grandfather\u2019s brother Tommy, who survived the war. By remarkable coincidence Tommy and John met at a field hospital shortly before John was killed. Even more of a coincidence, their sister Violet was working there as a nurse. \u201cTommy had been injured at the Somme. He spent three days in no man\u2019s land hiding under dead bodies in order to survive,\u201d she said. \u201cThen he continued to Flanders. \u201cBy 1918, both John and Tommy were serving in Flanders.\u201d The meeting at the field hospital was only brief before John was on his way back to the front, never to return. The family were from Nettlesworth in Co Durham, said Nicholls who lives in Ealing, west London. \u201cIt was one of countless villages where they would lose a whole generation.\u201d The People\u2019s Procession was important, she said. \u201cBecause the generation who had first-hand knowledge are dying out, not just those who served but those they told. \u201cI think it would be a lovely thing to allow descendants to continue to hold true to those memories.\u201d As the wreath laying comes to an end and the service by the Bishop of London, Dame Sarah Mullally, has started at the Cenotaph. A wreath has been laid at the cenotaph by the German president, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the first time a German leader has done so at the site. Prince Charles has also done so. Both are being followed by the political figures present. Big Ben, which has been silent since renovations to the Elizabeth Tower began in August last year, has been striking 11 o\u2019clock to mark the hour the armistice was signed. Two minutes of silence is now being observed. The last notes of Elgar\u2019s Nimrod has drifted off into the air down Whitehall as the ceremony at the Cenotaph gets underway. Political leaders including Theresa May, Jeremy Corbyn and former prime ministers are lining up with wreaths now as senior armed forces officers also come forward. From the royal family, Prince Charles will lay a wreath on behalf of his mother for the second year in a row while an equerry will lay a wreath on behalf of the Duke of Edinburgh. For the first time, a German leader will lay a wreath, with President Frank-Walter Steinmeier performing the duty on behalf of his nation in an historic act of reconciliation between the two countries. The Prince of Wales is now arriving with the German president. In French, English and Chinese, young people have been reading out letters from combatants at the commemoration in Paris as dignitaries and others listen. Aside from the representatives of what were the major powers at the time of the war, those gathered include leaders of states which had yet to come into existence. They include Taoiseach Leo Varadkar of Ireland. Irish government archives indicate that almost 80,000 men enlisted into the British army during the first 12 months of the conflict, joining 50,000 Irishmen who were already serving in the army. In Paris, around 70 heads of state, prime ministers and foreign dignitaries are gathered with Emmanuel Macron, at the start of armistice commemorations at the Arc de Triomphe. Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin was the last to arrive at the Arc de Triomphe, shaking hands with Macron and Angela Merkel. Putin then stopped to shake hands with the US president Donald Trump and gave Trump a thumbs up. In the pouring rain, most heads of state arrived with Macron in coaches driven up the Champs Elys\u00e9es from the presidential palace. They then walked slowly together under black umbrellas to the Arc de Triomphe, with Angela Merkel beside Macron. This image of leaders walking together through the rain was described by French commentators described as a moving gesture about peace. Some leaders were absent from this slow march, including the US president Donald Trump and the Russian leader Vladimir Putin, who both arrived at the Arc de Triomphe separately in their own security detail. Macron is to deliver a speech and then light a flame in honour of an unknown soldier. Testimonies written by soldiers on 11 November 1918, as the ceasefire took hold, will be read later by high school students in French, English and German. In London, the 10,000 people taking part in the People\u2019s Procession are gathering on The Mall to take part in this unique march past the Cenotaph to mark the centenary. Jackie Sheridan is marching for her great-great-uncle Oliver Davies who was killed in Palestine by a stray bullet while taking the horses to water. From Leicester, he was just 21 when he died on 2 December 1917 and was serving with the Royal Engineers. He was youngest of 13 children. \u201cHe was a driver but I think he was also the captain\u2019s groom,\u201d said Jackie, also from Leicester, who is marching with her husband Steven. She has the letter, now very fragile, sent by his captain on Oliver\u2019s death, praising him as a \u201ccheery\u201d lad who was \u201cloved by all\u201d and \u201cone of the best\u201d. The captain had erected a cross for him at his grave 15 miles from Jerusalem. On her phone Jackie has picture of a sketch that was drawn of his grave. \u201cI\u2019ve grown up with the story,\u201d said Jackie, a scout leader marching in her uniform. \u201cI shall salute when we get to the Cenotaph. \u201cIt\u2019s important to show your respect. We are passionate that the younger generation know and learn that peace is so much more important than war.\u201d With first world war veterans long passed and second world war veterans fading, it was important to keep the commemoration going, she said. \u201cI have a grandson who is only nine months old and I hope when he is old enough we will still carry on.\u201d Seventy world leaders are gathering in Paris, where they have walked side by side to commemorate the war in a somber, rain-soaked line as bells finished tolling. Arriving a few minutes late and in some cases struggling with umbrellas in the wind, they missed the exact moment to commemorate the armistice however. Fighter jets passed overhead as the leaders walked to the Arc de Triomphe. Macron is now making his way across to begin the official commemorations at this site. At Ypres, the Last Post has bee sounded at eleven minutes past eleven (local time), the moment when the armistice effect. It\u2019s worth noting that the armistice was signed much earlier in the morning and that many lost their lives in the hours afterwards. Nora Anderson lost four sons to the Great War \u2013 Charlie, Ronnie, Teddie and Bertie. The Guardian\u2019s Harriet Sherwood writes that that day their descendants will be one family among millions remembering those lost in the \u2018war to end all wars\u2019. \u201cI grew up with this story of the four boys who went to war and never came back,\u201d said Robin Scott-Elliot, Bertie\u2019s great-grandson. \u201cThe impact of their loss filtered down through generations. \u201cAs I watch my children grow up, and I think that Bertie never had that, I feel quite emotional.\u201d Bertie \u2013 Lieutenant Colonel William Herbert Anderson \u2013 was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross. Away from the battlefields, the sacrifices at home and those who cared for the returning survivors of the carnage are also being remembered: There has been some criticism of US president Donald Trump for missing a military memorial event on Saturday due to the rain. The UK veterans minister and former soldier Tobias Ellwood was among those chastising Trump after the cancellation of a visit to a US cemetery in Belleau, northern France, where American soldiers killed in the first world war are buried. Attending in Trump\u2019s place were the White House chief of staff, retired marine general John Kelly; the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, marine general Joe Dunford and several members of the White House staff. Meanwhile, others have been noting how the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, handled the rain in 2017 at an event to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the raid on Dieppe in France during the second world war: France\u2019s president Emmanuel Macron and Germany\u2019s chancellor, Angela Merkel, clasped hands on Saturday at a solemn ceremony at Compi\u00e8gne as they marked the centenary of the armistice signing. The Guardian\u2019s Kim Willsher was there and writes that it was the first time since 1940 that leaders from the two countries had met at the historic site, where Marshal Ferdinand Foch, supreme commander of the western front, signed the ceasefire agreement with Germany in a railway carriage. \u201cWe owe it to our soldiers,\u201d said Macron afterwards. Symbolically, he and Merkel sat side by side and not face to face as the French and German representatives had in 1918 and 1940. They then signed the visitors\u2019 book in a replica of Foch\u2019s railway carriage, known as the Compi\u00e8gne Wagon, where in an act of revenge Adolf Hitler forced France to sign its capitulation in June 1940. We have pieces exploring a range of facets about the conflict on our website today. They include this fascinating one by David Olusoga, the historian and broadcaster, on the black and Asian troops who fought beside white comrades but who experienced the return of racial subjugation after the armistice. He writes: When the guns fell silent in 1918, both victors and vanquished turned against the black and brown men who had fought in what the victory medals then being struck for each allied soldier called \u201cThe Great War for Civilisation\u201d. Among the forces sent to occupy the German Rhineland, under a clause of the armistice, were African American and French African troops. Whereas German complaints about the deployment of black soldiers in the trenches of the western front had largely failed to arouse international sympathy, now the war was over the propaganda campaign that was launched against the black soldiers of the army of occupation was a profound success, eliciting sympathy from the press and the trade union movement in Britain, and within sections of the public in the US. Read it in full here. One of the most innovative commemorative events is already also underway on more than 30 beaches around the UK as part of filmmaker Danny Boyle\u2019s UK-wide Pages of the Sea project for marking the centenary of the end of war. On the beaches, a large-scale portrait of a casualty from the conflict will be drawn in the sand and washed away as the tide comes in. Full details are the Pages of the Sea website. The high tide is due at around 10 o\u2019clock in Folkestone, where an image of Wilfred Owen has been drawn in the sand. Hundreds of members of the public are also etching out silhouettes of fallen soldiers. Here is a schedule of the most high profile events taking place on a global day of commemorations. BRITAIN \u2022 11am: two-minute silence followed by church bells ringing in unison across Britain. \u2022 Pages of the Sea event devised by Danny Boyle. The faces of first world war heroes will be sculpted in sand on 32 beaches. \u2022 11am: service at the Cenotaph in Whitehall; veterans\u2019 march-past co-ordinated by Royal British Legion. \u2022 12.30-1.30pm: the \u2018People\u2019s Procession\u2019 \u2013 10,000 people who secured tickets in a public ballot to parade past the Cenotaph. \u2022 5-10pm: 10,000 flames light up the moat around the Tower of London. \u2022 6.55pm: buglers sound the Last Post at more than 1,000 locations across Britain, and in Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Bermuda, France, Belgium, Canada, the United States and Germany. \u2022 7pm: first world war beacons of light will burn across the country to signify the light of peace. \u2022 7.05pm: church and cathedral bells to ring out. 100 town-criers call for peace around the world. FRANCE \u2022 10.30am: ceremony at the Australian National Memorial, Villers-Bretonneux, Somme. \u2022 10.40am: parade at the Thiepval Memorial to the Missing in Somme. \u2022 11am: remembrance ceremony at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, attended by French president Emmanuel Macron, US president Donald Trump, Russia president Vladimir Putin, German chancellor Angela Merkel and Irish taoiseach Leo Varadkar. \u2022 11am: ceremony at Newfoundland Memorial Park, near Beaumont-Hamel, Somme. BELGIUM \u2022 10.30am: remembrance ceremony at the municipal cemetery of Mons. \u2022 11am: Last Post service at the Menin Gate in Ypres, Flanders.. Commemorations have also already started in the UK, where more than 100 people gathered before dawn on Sunday in Enniskillen, the first town to hear of the armistice through a radio operator scanning the airwaves. Those gathered this morning were accompanied by the sound of a lone piper playing \u2018When The Battle\u2019s O\u2019er\u2019, a traditional tune played after battle. The Wilfred Owen poem Anthem For Doomed Youth was read before ministers from the four main churches in the town led prayers of reflection. The Last Post was played on the bugle that sounded the charge of the 36th Ulster Division at the Battle of the Somme in 1916, before a two-minute silence was observed. The Queen\u2019s representative, the Lord-Lieutenant for County Fermanagh, Viscount Brookborough gave the oration. \u201cAll of our communities served willingly and suffered equally throughout the long years of that war and I am delighted to see so many people here this morning,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Armistice was signed a few minutes after 5am on that 11th day, and we are in Enniskillen, the western most point of this celebration this year.\u201d Ceremonies have already been taking place in Australia and New Zealand, where crowds have fallen silent to commemorate the of thousands of those from both countries who gave their lives in the First World War. Thousands gathered for a national service of remembrance at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, where Prime Minister Scott Morrison led a minute\u2019s silence at 11am (midnight Saturday GMT). In Sydney, crowds gathered at the Anzac Memorial, an extension of which was unveiled by the Duke of Sussex during his recent trip with the Duchess of Sussex, while there was also a service at the Shrine of Remembrance in Melbourne. Some 331,000 Australians served overseas during the first world war, the vast majority of whom fought on the Western Front alongside British soldiers and their allies. Over 60,000 died in the conflict, more than two-thirds on the battlefields of Europe. Earlier, large crowds attended the Pukeahu National War Memorial Park in Wellington for New Zealand\u2019s main remembrance ceremony, where a minute\u2019s silence was observed at 11am (10pm GMT Saturday). Nearly 100,000 served in New Zealand units overseas, with around a fifth never returning home. Good morning and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s liveblog coverage of the armistice commemorations. Events today will mark the culmination of four years of events to commemorate the first world war and those who lost their lives in that conflict. It\u2019s going to a day of remembrance around Europe, with high-level events concentrated particularly in France, Britain and Belgium, but with countless smaller ceremonies and simple acts of commemoration in towns, villages, and homes. International Armistice Day commemorations will be led by President Macron in Paris at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, which lies at the foot of the Arc de Triomphe monument. After that ceremony, Chancellor Angela Merkel will join Presidents Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump, along with leaders and representatives of most of the countries that fought in the conflict at a reception in Versailles to celebrate the opening of the Paris Peace Forum. In London, a procession of 10,000 people to the Cenotaph later today will remember those who laid down their lives in world war one. The Queen and German president Frank-Walter Steinmeier will be among those at Westminster Abbey for a service. I\u2019ll post a fuller schedule shortly, but in the meantime here is a piece from Esther Addley on how communities have been preparing for the armistice centenary.",

          "body": "<h2><strong>Monday</strong></h2> <p>The culture and media secretary, Jeremy Wright, used his keynote speech to the Society of Editors to tell everyone that he never bothers to read the newspapers. Pressed to name a single woman columnist, Wright became defensive and said he wasn\u2019t going to indulge in \u201ca pub quiz\u201d. Second question, name the capital of France. As his department also covers digital and sport, no doubt we can soon expect him to admit he doesn\u2019t watch TV, read books, use the internet or go to theatre, concerts or sporting events. Then Theresa May does have form for appointing people with no obvious credentials to big jobs. Chris Grayling\u2019s lack of aptitude for anything hasn\u2019t stopped him becoming transport secretary and Karen Bradley was made Northern Ireland secretary despite being clueless that the province was divided along sectarian lines. Also this week, we had the Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab \u2013 a man who apparently prides himself on his intellect \u2013 saying he hadn\u2019t appreciated \u201cthe peculiar geographic economic entity that is the United Kingdom\u201d. By which he meant he hadn\u2019t realised the UK was an island. Then we have the strange case of the philosopher <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/nov/03/the-alf-garnett-of-architecture-roger-scruton-to-chair-buildings-commission\">Roger Scruton</a>. No one is quite sure whether it\u2019s his work on aesthetics and Kant or his homophobia and Islamophobia that qualify him for the job of housing tsar.</p> <h2><strong>Tuesday</strong></h2> <p>YouGov has published a list of popularity ratings for politicians \u2013 based largely on the level of public recognition. Top of the list come Boris Johnson and Theresa May with 32% and Jeremy Corbyn with 30%. Curiously the second most highly ranked Labour politician is Ed Balls, despite the fact he hasn\u2019t been an MP for more than three years. Then again, if most of the shadow cabinet can\u2019t recognise one another then why should the public? The ratings also provide some interesting guilt by association. If you recognise Boris, then you\u2019re also likely to recognise Piers Morgan. Bizarrely, for Theresa May the associations you get are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/18/accrington-stanley-promotion-league-one\">Accrington Stanley FC</a>, Chris de Burgh and the Daily Express. Inevitably, there\u2019s as much fun to be had at the other end of the ratings with Tory Mark Field coming in last in 228th<sup> </sup>place with a rating of just 2%. To which many would say: \u201cThat high?\u201d Sadly, YouGov is not able to provide any further fan data on Field as no one cares enough about him to have volunteered any extra information. There\u2019s also bad news for Donald Trump. On the list of foreign politicians he is only in seventh place, lagging behind Barack Obama, Justin Trudeau, Angela Merkel, Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton and Imran Khan. Call that the category of the world as we would like it to be.</p> <h2><strong>Wednesday</strong></h2> <p>Trump\u2019s White House press conference following the midterm elections was an object lesson in an unmedicated narcissistic breakdown. For someone who professed himself to be so delighted at the total success of getting a dead brothel owner elected to the Nevada state legislature while losing a Republican majority in House of Representatives, the president spent much of the two hour Q&amp;A in a state of unconstrained fury. First he had yet another run-in with CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta, which culminated in the reporter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/07/cnn-jim-acosta-reporter-credentials-revoked\">being banned from the White House</a>, then he declared war on any opponents who might try to investigate him, before rounding on a black journalist for asking what he called a \u201cracist question\u201d. It was gripping, if disturbing, political theatre. Still, whatever you might think of Trump\u2019s disregard for truth, morality and decency, at least he puts himself in the spotlight where his flaws can be exposed. Theresa May often talks up her belief in the value of a free press but only ever gives press conferences when she absolutely has to \u2013 such as after EU summits \u2013 and would never dream of letting them last for two hours. She usually limits herself to four questions at absolute tops, and even then invariably manages to give the same non-answer to each of them.</p> <h2><strong>Thursday</strong></h2> <p>Identity politics has just become even more of a minefield. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/08/dutch-man-69-starts-legal-fight-to-identify-as-20-years-younger\">Emile Ratelband</a>, a 69-year-old Dutchman who describes himself as a motivational speaker, has begun a legal battle to have himself reassigned as a 49-year-old. He argues that he feels 20 years younger than he is and that he is being unfairly swiped left on dating apps by people who don\u2019t realise quite how much love he has to give. Or to put it another way, he is upset at only attracting partners of his own age when obviously in a less discriminatory world 30-something woman would be throwing themselves at his love machine of a body. It is almost certifiable: Ratelband is trying to wipe out the first 20 years of his life by insisting that 1969 was the year of his birth, when it\u2019s actually the last 20 years of his life he\u2019s unhappy with. He\u2019d be better off trying to get the courts to declare that we are all actually still living in 1998. Most people I know would rather be declared 20 years older than they actually are. If I were to become 82 overnight, I could put in a backdated claim for 17 years of unpaid state pension, while still doing a job I enjoy, and stand a better chance of living to 100. Better still, people might actually say how young I look and mean it.</p> <h2><strong>Friday</strong></h2> <p>My insistence on a three-day diversion to visit first world war battlefields in Belgium and France, on one of the first holidays my wife and I went on before we got married, didn\u2019t go down too well. It wasn\u2019t exactly her idea of fun. Nor mine particularly. More a sense of a connection I needed to make, and on the centenary of the Armistice on Sunday my thoughts are sure to return \u2013 as they do every Remembrance Day \u2013 to the rows of identical gravestones in the immaculately maintained cemeteries. How and what we choose to remember is a puzzle. I\u2019ve been reading the newly published <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/nov/04/letters-home-1936-1977-philip-larkin-edited-by-james-booth-review\">Philip Larkin: Letters Home 1936-1977</a> and he observes that Tennyson\u2019s generation used to commemorate those who died in the Napoleonic Wars. No one remembers them now. It\u2019s as if there\u2019s only so much observance of remembrance that anyone can take. Larkin finds himself puzzled that on an Armistice Day just after the second world war, his thoughts are still entirely focused on those who died in the 1914-18 conflict rather than on those \u2013 some of whom he must have personally known \u2013 who died much more recently. The BBC has also published a fascinating story on its website about how, in the early years after 1918, many veterans would \u2013 having observed the two-minute silence \u2013 go off to have wild parties in the evening to celebrate the fact they were still alive. The largest and the most glamorous ones took place at the Albert Hall. It was only in the mid-1920s that the orthodoxy for solemnity became established and the parties came to an end. A shame perhaps. Some of the most memorable and moving funerals I have been to have been those that ended in a party. There is no right way to remember. All that matters is that we do.</p> <p><strong>Digested week, digested: </strong>Breaking news: Britain is an island that is quite near to France<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c9318bdc01a23863f2c6deb5259a03fb742eb97b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c9318bdc01a23863f2c6deb5259a03fb742eb97b/0_0_4329_5408/800.jpg\" alt=\"Imogen Edwards-Jones and David Cameron attend the launch of Imogen Edwards-Jones\u2019 new book \u201cThe Witches Of St Petersburg\u201d at the South Kensington Club on November 7, 2018 in London, England.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Cameron: \u2018It\u2019s no good, I\u2019m still bored shitless.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David M Benett/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br></p> <p><br></p>",

As his department also covers digital and sport, no doubt we can soon expect him to admit he doesn\u2019t watch TV, read books, use the internet or go to theatre, concerts or sporting events. Then Theresa May does have form for appointing people with no obvious credentials to big jobs. Chris Grayling\u2019s lack of aptitude for anything hasn\u2019t stopped him becoming transport secretary and Karen Bradley was made Northern Ireland secretary despite being clueless that the province was divided along sectarian lines. Also this week, we had the Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab \u2013 a man who apparently prides himself on his intellect \u2013 saying he hadn\u2019t appreciated \u201cthe peculiar geographic economic entity that is the United Kingdom\u201d. By which he meant he hadn\u2019t realised the UK was an island. Then we have the strange case of the philosopher Roger Scruton. No one is quite sure whether it\u2019s his work on aesthetics and Kant or his homophobia and Islamophobia that qualify him for the job of housing tsar. Tuesday YouGov has published a list of popularity ratings for politicians \u2013 based largely on the level of public recognition. Top of the list come Boris Johnson and Theresa May with 32% and Jeremy Corbyn with 30%. Curiously the second most highly ranked Labour politician is Ed Balls, despite the fact he hasn\u2019t been an MP for more than three years. Then again, if most of the shadow cabinet can\u2019t recognise one another then why should the public? The ratings also provide some interesting guilt by association. If you recognise Boris, then you\u2019re also likely to recognise Piers Morgan. Bizarrely, for Theresa May the associations you get are Accrington Stanley FC, Chris de Burgh and the Daily Express. Inevitably, there\u2019s as much fun to be had at the other end of the ratings with Tory Mark Field coming in last in 228th place with a rating of just 2%. To which many would say: \u201cThat high?\u201d Sadly, YouGov is not able to provide any further fan data on Field as no one cares enough about him to have volunteered any extra information. There\u2019s also bad news for Donald Trump. On the list of foreign politicians he is only in seventh place, lagging behind Barack Obama, Justin Trudeau, Angela Merkel, Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton and Imran Khan. Call that the category of the world as we would like it to be. Wednesday Trump\u2019s White House press conference following the midterm elections was an object lesson in an unmedicated narcissistic breakdown. For someone who professed himself to be so delighted at the total success of getting a dead brothel owner elected to the Nevada state legislature while losing a Republican majority in House of Representatives, the president spent much of the two hour Q&amp;A in a state of unconstrained fury. First he had yet another run-in with CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta, which culminated in the reporter being banned from the White House, then he declared war on any opponents who might try to investigate him, before rounding on a black journalist for asking what he called a \u201cracist question\u201d. It was gripping, if disturbing, political theatre. Still, whatever you might think of Trump\u2019s disregard for truth, morality and decency, at least he puts himself in the spotlight where his flaws can be exposed. Theresa May often talks up her belief in the value of a free press but only ever gives press conferences when she absolutely has to \u2013 such as after EU summits \u2013 and would never dream of letting them last for two hours. She usually limits herself to four questions at absolute tops, and even then invariably manages to give the same non-answer to each of them. Thursday Identity politics has just become even more of a minefield. Emile Ratelband, a 69-year-old Dutchman who describes himself as a motivational speaker, has begun a legal battle to have himself reassigned as a 49-year-old. He argues that he feels 20 years younger than he is and that he is being unfairly swiped left on dating apps by people who don\u2019t realise quite how much love he has to give. Or to put it another way, he is upset at only attracting partners of his own age when obviously in a less discriminatory world 30-something woman would be throwing themselves at his love machine of a body. It is almost certifiable: Ratelband is trying to wipe out the first 20 years of his life by insisting that 1969 was the year of his birth, when it\u2019s actually the last 20 years of his life he\u2019s unhappy with. He\u2019d be better off trying to get the courts to declare that we are all actually still living in 1998. Most people I know would rather be declared 20 years older than they actually are. If I were to become 82 overnight, I could put in a backdated claim for 17 years of unpaid state pension, while still doing a job I enjoy, and stand a better chance of living to 100. Better still, people might actually say how young I look and mean it. Friday My insistence on a three-day diversion to visit first world war battlefields in Belgium and France, on one of the first holidays my wife and I went on before we got married, didn\u2019t go down too well. It wasn\u2019t exactly her idea of fun. Nor mine particularly. More a sense of a connection I needed to make, and on the centenary of the Armistice on Sunday my thoughts are sure to return \u2013 as they do every Remembrance Day \u2013 to the rows of identical gravestones in the immaculately maintained cemeteries. How and what we choose to remember is a puzzle. I\u2019ve been reading the newly published Philip Larkin: Letters Home 1936-1977 and he observes that Tennyson\u2019s generation used to commemorate those who died in the Napoleonic Wars. No one remembers them now. It\u2019s as if there\u2019s only so much observance of remembrance that anyone can take. Larkin finds himself puzzled that on an Armistice Day just after the second world war, his thoughts are still entirely focused on those who died in the 1914-18 conflict rather than on those \u2013 some of whom he must have personally known \u2013 who died much more recently. The BBC has also published a fascinating story on its website about how, in the early years after 1918, many veterans would \u2013 having observed the two-minute silence \u2013 go off to have wild parties in the evening to celebrate the fact they were still alive. The largest and the most glamorous ones took place at the Albert Hall. It was only in the mid-1920s that the orthodoxy for solemnity became established and the parties came to an end. A shame perhaps. Some of the most memorable and moving funerals I have been to have been those that ended in a party. There is no right way to remember. All that matters is that we do.

          "bodyText": "Monday Ottawa\u2019s most notable building is its majestic gothic parliament and it\u2019s one of the landmarks you can take in when exploring the city on foot. Try Ottawa Walking Tours, Ottawa Free Tours, or your own river- and canal-side wanderings on paths around Parliament Hill. For bygone tales of brawling French and Irish gangs, don\u2019t miss the city history on show at the old stone Bytown Museum. Finish the day at ByWard Market, the hub of the city\u2019s most happening central district and one of Canada\u2019s oldest and biggest public markets. Shop the unique stores along the market streets and cobblestone courtyards. You can sip on a locally brewed craft beer and try a gourmet hotdog at Tavern on the Hill, with a spectacular view of Parliament Hill. The Bytown Museum (top); ByWard Market; looking back at the city from the Gatineau Hills Tuesday If the weather\u2019s fair then don\u2019t wait to head to the Gatineau Hills. The Gatineau Park Visitor Centre will help you choose the right hiking trail and is located in the village of Chelsea, where the Nordik Spa-Nature vies with Le Pub Chelsea as the best place to unravel after a day in the hills. Which is better: a view of Ottawa\u2019s twinkling city lights from a hot tub, or a craft brew in a gregarious country tavern? Best do both to check. Wednesday Hop on a bike to explore areas such as The Glebe and Little Italy With both central Ottawa and its most attractive park under your belt, it\u2019s time to explore everything in between. This is best done by bike and RentABike has a good selection of tours and downloadable routes. Key options follow the city\u2019s waterways: the Rideau canal loop connects attractive neighbourhoods such as Little Italy and The Glebe with waterfalls; the longer Ottawa River paths provide grand city views. Before you head out, limber up at the free drop-in Parliament Hill yoga session (summer Wednesdays at noon). You\u2019ll be among hundreds, so no need to worry about smooth moves \u2013 though PM Justin Trudeau has been known to pop by and greet participants. Try trendy Hintonburg for a delicious meal at Supply and Demand or Bar Laurel. Thursday The Canadian Museum of History is one of the museums covered by the National Museums Passport At least one day in Ottawa should be devoted to its terrific national museums \u2013 they\u2019re all free on Thursdays 5-8pm, though three hours is rarely enough. With Canada\u2019s National Museums Passport, you can choose admission to any three museums for just $35. Guarded by a giant Louise Bourgeois spider sculpture, the National Gallery of Canada is memorable for its indigenous art. If you like this, then visit the ethnographic collections of the wide-ranging Canadian Museum of History, whose on-site Children\u2019s Museum is in a class of its own for educational interactive play. There\u2019s more education and play, along with painstakingly made dioramas of wildlife habitats, at the Canadian Museum of Nature. For a change of pace, try the Canadian War Museum, whose coverage of Canadian conflicts and military hardware collection is moving and engaging. There\u2019s also the chance to continue your museum visit after hours \u2013 on specific Fridays the Canadian Museum of Nature turns the museum into an adult zone, with music and mingling. You could grab a nightcap at Copper Spirits &amp; Sights, the rooftop patio of the Andaz Ottawa Byward Market hotel, and watch the sunset. Friday Adrenaline junkies should head for the Great Canadian Bungee Enjoy Ottawa\u2019s out-of-town attractions before the weekend crowds arrive. Parc Omega is a Canadian safari park with deer, elk, caribou, bison, bears and wolves \u2013 you can even feed many of them. There\u2019s more action to be found at the Great Canadian Bungee, where North America\u2019s highest jump (61 metres) and a giant zip-line are located beside a pleasant little beach and picnic spot (for non-thrillseekers). From June to September, you can also get your thrills white-water rafting \u2013 try River Run Rafting or Wilderness Tours Packages for organised trips on the Ottawa River. For a more vintage experience, don flying goggles with Ottawa Biplane Adventures, which offers open-cockpit city tours from its base at the Canadian Museum of Space and Aviation, itself a worthwhile aeronautical outing. Back in town you may round the day off with an After Dark Tour, a walking tour that recounts some seedy and grisly history before dropping you at the free Northern Lights show, a must-see nightly laser-light extravaganza at the parliament from early July to early September. Saturday After lunch in Chinatown (top), head out on a craft brewery tour with Brew Donkey Ottawa\u2019s neighbourhoods bustle most on Saturdays. Breakfast on the Golden Triangle\u2019s Elgin Street, visit the home of the city\u2019s LGBT community on Bank Street, have lunch in Chinatown; then head to the hipster frontier of Hintonburg to pick up repurposed souvenirs by local artists and craftspeople at Maker House, such as coat hooks made from an old ice hockey stick. It\u2019s also from here that brewery tour operator Brew Donkey strikes out on fun five-hour weekend tours of local craft beer breweries in an old school bus. Sunday Watch bagels being made at Kettleman\u2019s Sunday is farmers\u2019 market day in Ottawa and the biggest option is the Ottawa Farmers\u2019 Market in the Glebe, a blue-collar-gone-hip neighbourhood where old-school independent shops and restaurants thrive. Don\u2019t miss Kettleman\u2019s, a longstanding 24-hour place where you can watch and smell bagels being baked. The Glebe\u2019s TD Place is where the Redblacks play Canadian football, Ottawa Fury play football (or rather soccer), and the Ottawa 67\u2019s play ice hockey. Between them, there\u2019s at least one fixture most weeks, often on Sundays. Round your busy week off with a well-earned nightcap at Chateau Lafayette, also known as the Laff, Ottawa\u2019s oldest tavern (it dates from 1849).

Moreover, a carbon tax doesn\u2019t necessarily have to reflect the social cost of carbon. The question is whether it will be sufficiently high to meet the country\u2019s climate targets.</p> <h2><strong>Paris was a key motivator behind the Canadian carbon tax</strong></h2> <p>The Preamble in the Act is worth reading. It begins by noting \u201cthere is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/oct/22/trump-thinks-scientists-are-split-on-climate-change-so-do-most-americans?utm_source=esp&amp;utm_medium=Email&amp;utm_campaign=GU+Today+USA+-+Collections+2017&amp;utm_term=288237&amp;subid=12374406&amp;CMP=GT_US_collection\">broad scientific consensus</a> that anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions contribute to global climate change\u201d (this is somewhat understated \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2013/sep/27/global-warming-ipcc-report-humans\">carbon pollution is the dominant factor</a>). It also notes that Canada is already feeling the impacts of climate change through factors like \u201ccoastal erosion, thawing permafrost, increases in heat waves, droughts and flooding, and related risks to critical infrastructures and food security.\u201d</p> <p>The Preamble also notes that in 1992, Canada signed the <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/\">UNFCCC</a> whose objectives include \u201cthe stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system,\u201d and that Canada ratified <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/dec/14/the-paris-agreement-signals-that-deniers-have-lost-the-climate-wars\">the Paris Agreement</a>, whose aims include limiting global warming to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/oct/15/theres-one-key-takeaway-from-last-weeks-ipcc-report\">less than 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial temperatures</a>.</p> <p>Canada\u2019s Paris commitment requires cutting its carbon pollution by 30% below 2005 levels by 2030. Prior to the implementation of the carbon tax, its policies were rated <a href=\"https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/canada/\">Highly Insufficient</a> to meet that goal. Instead Canada\u2019s emissions were on track to fall only about 4% below 2005 levels by 2030. So, the carbon tax is an important policy to close that gap.</p> <h2><strong>Some provinces already have carbon pricing in place</strong></h2> <p>Several Canadian provinces have already implemented or plan to implement carbon pricing systems. British Columbia, Alberta, and Quebec already have such systems in place; <a href=\"https://pm.gc.ca/eng/news/2018/10/23/government-canada-fighting-climate-change-price-pollution\">the Canadian government noted</a> that these provinces were \u201camong the top performers in GDP growth across Canada in 2017.\u201d</p> <p>Provinces whose carbon prices meet the federal standards are already in compliance, so the new law won\u2019t apply to them. Several other provinces (Northwest Territories, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland and Labrador) have planned or proposed carbon pricing systems that will meet the federal requirements. The federal carbon tax will be applied to the remaining provinces.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"13df1378a5d1489849af5212adad26edc1442e8c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13df1378a5d1489849af5212adad26edc1442e8c/0_0_746_623/500.png\" alt=\"Green indicates that the province\u2019s own carbon pricing system meets the federal standards.

So, in 2022, the $50/ton carbon tax will increase Canadian gasoline prices by about 42 cents per gallon (11 cents per liter). For comparison, the average price of gasoline in Canada is <a href=\"https://www.globalpetrolprices.com/Canada/gasoline_prices/\">$1.43 per liter</a>, so that would be about an 8% gasoline price increase in 2022.</p> <p>The price of coal would more than double, with a carbon tax surcharge of about $100 per ton in 2022. Natural gas prices will rise by about 10 cents per cubic meter in 2022 compared to current prices of around 13 cents per cubic meter \u2013 about a 75% increase. This will increase demand for cheaper carbon-free electricity. However, Canada already supplies about 60% of its electricity through hydroelectric generation and 16% from nuclear \u2013 only about 20\u201325% comes from fossil fuels.</p> <p>For that reason, only 11% of Canada\u2019s carbon pollution comes from generating electricity. The <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/services/environment/weather/climatechange/climate-action/pricing-carbon-pollution.html?utm_campaign=not-applicable&amp;&amp;utm_medium=vanity-url&amp;&amp;utm_source=canada-ca_climate-action\">industrial sector is responsible for the biggest chunk</a> of Canadian carbon pollution (40%). It will not be subjected to the carbon tax, but rather to <a href=\"https://ecofiscal.ca/2017/05/24/explaining-output-based-allocations-obas/\">an Output-Based Allocations system</a> (similar to cap and trade).</p> <h2><strong>But rebates will more than offset higher fuel costs</strong></h2> <p>One key component of the federal carbon tax is that it\u2019s revenue-neutral, similar to <a href=\"https://citizensclimatelobby.org/basics-carbon-fee-dividend/\">the policy proposal from Citizens\u2019 Climate Lobby</a>. All the taxed money will be distributed back to the provinces from which they were generated. The provinces will in turn rebate about 90% the revenues back to individual taxpayers. The rebates are anticipated to exceed the increased energy costs for about 70% of Canadian households.</p> <p>For example, a <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/climate-change/pricing-pollution-how-it-will-work/manitoba.html\">Manitoba</a> family will receive a $336 rebate in 2019 compared to its increased costs of $232. A similar family in <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/climate-change/pricing-pollution-how-it-will-work/saskatchewan.html\">Saskatchewan</a> will receive $598 compared to its higher costs of $403. In <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/climate-change/pricing-pollution-how-it-will-work/ontario.html\">Ontario</a>, families will receive $300 to offset its $244 in carbon taxes. And in <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/climate-change/pricing-pollution-how-it-will-work/new-brunswick.html\">New Brunswick</a> a $248 rebate more than offsets the average household cost of $202. The rebates will more than double by 2022 as the carbon tax rises, and <a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-most-families-will-get-rebates-from-new-carbon-tax-trudeau-says/\">the net financial benefit to households will grow over time</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/dalebeugin/status/1054775669048131591\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">6.

Berlin has halted arms sales to Saudi and Angela Merkel has urged allies to do the same in condemnation of what she has described as a \u201cmonstrous\u201d killing inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. MEPs voted on Thursday on a non-binding resolution further demanding a unified move by the bloc\u2019s 28 member states to \u201cimpose an EU-wide arms embargo on Saudi Arabia\u201d.

          "bodyText": "Good morning. I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s headlines. If you\u2019d like to receive this briefing by email, sign up here. Top story: Republicans renew strategy of racial division The caravan of more than 7,000 Central Americans moving steadily north through Mexico has become political ammunition for Donald Trump, who calls it an \u201cassault on our country\u201d. In Huixtla, David Agren hears migrants\u2019 stories \u2013 of lives made impossible by violence, poverty and corruption \u2013 and Lauren Gambino reports on the Republicans\u2019 midterm strategy: fear and racial division. Tech support. Tech firms including Microsoft and Amazon are making millions from surveillance, detention and deportation tools under the Trump administration\u2019s anti-immigration agenda, according to a report. Family ties. Nevada gubernatorial hopeful Adam Laxalt is the latest Republican midterm candidate to be publicly disowned by his own family, 12 of whom wrote a critical op-ed in the Reno Gazette. Trump says Saudi crown prince may be behind Khashoggi death Trump has admitted for the first time that the Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, a close ally of his administration, could have been involved in the brutal murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Trump\u2019s comments, in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, came after the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, called for the \u201chighest ranked\u201d of the Saudis responsible for the killing to be brought to justice. Arms trade. Justin Trudeau is unlikely to cancel a sale of Canadian armoured personnel carriers to Saudi Arabia. But Australia\u2019s foreign minister refused to rule out a ban on arms exports to the kingdom. Brief encounter. With the murder still casting a pall over Riyadh, Khashoggi\u2019s son was summoned to meet the crown prince in a brief, stage-managed encounter. US confirms withdrawal from nuclear arms treaty with Russia John Bolton, the US national security adviser, confirmed on Tuesday that the US would withdraw from its Reagan-era intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty (INF) with Russia, after meeting with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, at the Kremlin. Speaking in Moscow, Bolton said Russia had long flouted the treaty, and the US decision to withdraw was based on the \u201cnew strategic reality\u201d of China\u2019s rise as a superpower. Nuclear-free. The INF treaty, which was signed in 1987, is widely credited with having kept nuclear missiles out of Europe. White nationalist Richard Spencer\u2019s wife accuses him of physical abuse The wife of the prominent far-right figure Richard Spencer has accused him of emotional and physical abuse in divorce filings. Nina Koupriianova says Spencer repeatedly said \u201cthe only language women understand is violence\u201d, choked her, dragged her by her hair and tried to punch her while she was pregnant. The couple have two children. Violent tendency. Matthew Heimbach, another leading US neo-Nazi, was arrested on domestic violence charges in March. Atlanta Week: the problem with Stone Mountain As part of the Guardian\u2019s week of stories from Atlanta, Khushbu Shah visits Stone Mountain, the site of the nation\u2019s biggest Confederate monument \u2013 aka \u201cthe KKK\u2019s Mount Rushmore\u201d \u2013 to ask whether it\u2019s time to tear it down. Crib sheet Global markets plunged further on Tuesday, spooked by the prospect of a US-China trade war, rising US interest rates and the budget dispute between the EU and Italy. Hurricane Willa made landfall on Mexico\u2019s Pacific coast near Mazatl\u00e1n on Tuesday night, bringing 120mph winds and threatening up to 18 inches of rain in some areas. Tall people are at greater risk of cancer simply because they\u2019re bigger, and thus have more cells in their body at risk of dangerous mutations, a study has suggested. The endangered Malayan tiger is facing the destruction of its Malaysian forest habitat, to make way for plantations to satisfy China\u2019s appetite for the infamously smelly durian fruit. Must-reads The old west at a new frontier: the most realistic game ever Rockstar\u2019s latest blockbuster, the western adventure Red Dead Redemption 2, took seven years and hundreds of millions of dollars to complete. It\u2019s a far cry from Pac-Man. Keza MacDonald goes behind the scenes of the most realistic video game ever made. Apichatpong Weerasethakul: the director with an exploding head The acclaimed Thai director Apichatpong Weerasethakul has \u201cexploding head syndrome\u201d, a condition that informed his new film with Tilda Swinton. He tells Hannah Ellis-Peterson about his work and its relationship to Thailand: \u201cThis country is so repressive, but is also very liveable \u2013 and I\u2019m fascinated by that contrast.\u201d How New Hampshire became a battlefield for voting rights It may not be the first swing state that comes to mind in a conversation about voting rights, but since Republicans took control of New Hampshire in 2016, they have targeted the voting rights of about 90,000 college students \u2013 or so say the young Democrats running to reclaim the Granite State. Opinion The Trump administration is reportedly considering rolling back trans rights by defining gender as fixed biology based on genitalia at birth. Alex Myers says his own long fight for recognition tells him he\u2019ll be one of many thousands ready to resist. The government wants to deny who I am. Wants to erase my identity. Wants to tell me who and what I can be, based on how I appeared at birth Sport The Red Sox outmatched the LA Dodgers in the first game of the World Series, winning 8-4 at Fenway Park, powered by a three-run homer from pinch-hitter Eduardo N\u00fa\u00f1ez. A dominant Cristiano Ronaldo helped Juventus to their 1-0 Champions League victory over his old club, Manchester United, at Old Trafford, with the United manager, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, admitting the Italian team were at a \u201cdifferent level of quality\u201d.

          "bodyText": "The foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, has not ruled out an arms export ban to Saudi Arabia or sanctions, amid the global backlash against the kingdom over the killing of a journalist. During a Senate estimates hearing in Canberra on Wednesday, the Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, asked Payne \u201cat what point does Australia take a stand\u201d and ban export sales and impose sanctions. Payne responded the Australian government was closely watching the investigation into the \u201chorrendous\u201d death of the Washington Post reporter Jamal Khashoggi. \u201cAll options are on the table, in terms of Australia respective response,\u201d Payne told the hearing. \u201cWe recognise this is an extremely serious situation of the highest order of magnitude.\u201d The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, this week announced her government would not approve new arms exports to the kingdom. Payne confirmed she had discussed the issue with European counterparts in recent days. Under questioning from the Labor senator Alex Gallacher, Defence admitted it had made 14 approvals of military gear and services to Saudi Arabia in the past two years. There were seven physical exports and three information-related exports given the nod last year. So far this year there has been four physical military exports approved to Riyadh. Department official Tom Hamilton refused to release the value of the exports or the nature of the goods for \u201ccommercial in-confidence\u201d reasons. Hamilton emphasised Defence assessed a range of factors when considering approvals including international obligations, human rights, national and regional security, foreign policy and the risk equipment could be used to commit abuse. The figures come amid ongoing criticism about Australia\u2019s defence industry ties to Saudi Arabia amid ongoing atrocities in the Yemen conflict. Hamilton could not categorically rule out Australian military equipment being used in Yemen war \u2013 which the United Nations has dubbed the \u201cworst humanitarian crisis in the world\u201d. He insisted the department was \u201cvery concerned in relation to current events\u201d. \u201cMilitary equipment by its nature will contribute to the capability of a military force and will often contribute to a conflict,\u201d Hamilton said. But he said permits were not approved if they were considered likely to contravene international obligations. The US president, Donald Trump, has ruled out an arms ban while Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said his government would go ahead with a Saudi armoured vehicle export contract. Saudi Arabia is the world\u2019s largest importer of defence equipment and services by value according to a research group called IHS Markit. In September, the defence minister, Christopher Pyne, flagged the federal government hoped to negotiate a defence cooperation memorandum of understanding with Saudi Arabia. Hamilton said discussions were in the early stages and \u201cit was not a priority at this time\u201d. He declined to say whether Saudi Arabia or Australia initiated the agreement but promised to provide a written answer at a later date. In January, the Turnbull government unveiled a plan for Australia to become a top 10 global arms exporter in the next decade. Hamilton told the hearing Defence was still working out transparency measures around that strategy and had to balance up accountability versus commercial interests. Last week, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, withdrew Australian representatives from a major investment summit in Riyadh. Save the Children has called on the Australian government to cease supplying military assets to Saudi Arabia until it halts unlawful airstrikes. The charity noted 22.2 million Yemenis, including 11.3 million children, are in need of humanitarian aid. \u201cAustralia should use its place on the world stage to end human rights abuses, rather than supplying means to potentially prolong them,\u201d spokesman Mat Tinkler said. * Do you know more?

          "bodyText": "Spring (April-May): Spring is a good time to join a historic or culinary walking tour of Toronto or Ottawa, don\u2019t forget to fuel up in one of the many good coffee shops. Queues are much shorter at major attractions such as Niagara Falls, so why not take a Hornblower Niagara Cruise, a ride on Niagara Helicopters or a thrilling MistRider zipline ride? The spring weather is ideal for bike tours of Niagara\u2019s wineries, distilleries and craft breweries, such as Niagara Oast House Brewers. A culinary walking tour of Toronto won\u2019t disappoint, taking in Chinatown and Kensington Market (top). In March, see maple trees being tapped and indulge in their syrup If you would like to see where maple syrup comes from, around March is the time to join a Sugar Bush tour to see how the trees are tapped or find a pancake festival in April to enjoy the end product. This season is also a good time to go hiking before the crowds come out and the weather heats up. The Bruce Trail (Unesco biosphere designated) stretches from the Niagara Escarpment to Tobermory, 500 miles of scenic trails, while you don\u2019t even need to leave Toronto to hike the forested slopes of the 16 hectare (40-acre) High park. Summer (June-August): The splendid Georgian Bay becomes a summer hotspot; it\u2019s also an ideal time for a lazy cruise on a LeBoat houseboat on the Rideau canal, a Unesco heritage site (photo: @HolgerLeue). Summer unofficially starts on the third weekend of May with the Victoria Day holiday marking Queen Victoria\u2019s birthday. It\u2019s the start of cottage season, when all roads lead to Georgian Bay, Muskoka or Lake Simcoe, for barbecues, watersports and weekend partying at Ontarians\u2019 seasonal residences. With the weather hot and humid, Ontario has endless supplies of water to cool off in; paddle or cruise around the 1,000 Islands near Kingston, sail on the Great Lakes, or enjoy a canoe or kayak adventure on one of the many lakes or rivers in Muskoka. Whitewater raft just 90 minutes from Ottawa, along the Ottawa River or take a LeBoat cruiser along the Rideau canal to Kingston. TIFF has become a world-renowned film festival Don\u2019t miss the waterways of Algonquin park \u2013 Justin Trudeau spent his childhood summers here. Like living life on two wheels? Then Manitoulin Island on Lake Huron in Northern Ontario is the place to be, with over 800km of road-biking routes. Summer is the peak season for festivals \u2013 starting with the major fun around Canada Day on 1 July anywhere in Ontario, and then you have choices that range from the Niagara wine festival to TIFF (Toronto international film festival), taking in Nuit Blanche art projects at major art venues, and even music and food truck festivals. Let\u2019s not forget Glengarry Highland Games, the Whitchurch-Stouffville strawberry festival and the Toronto Summerlicious food festival, where more than 200 restaurants offer specially priced set menus, among many others. Autumn (September-December): The National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa As the leaves start to fall, enjoy the abundance of colours in Ontario\u2019s thousands of miles of forest. Allow two weeks for a proper fly-drive tour from Toronto of highlights including Niagara, Blue Mountain, Muskoka, Algonquin park, Ottawa, 1,000 Islands and Prince Edward County. September and October are also prime times for spotting the northern lights; ride the Polar Bear Express from Cochrane to Moosonee for your best chance of catching this natural phenomenon.

Major events to look out for include the Blue Mountains apple harvest festival, Bala cranberry festival, and Kitchener-Waterloo Oktoberfest. Many small towns have their own homely harvest and pumpkin festivals, complete with family fun such as traditional music and ploughing matches. Winter (January-March): Try your hand at dog sledding in one of Ontario\u2019s luxurious ski resorts As the snowfall peaks, ice hockey fills the TV schedules but it\u2019s even more fun to get out and enjoy the winter wonderland for yourself.

          "bodyText": "The UK, France and Germany have pressed Saudi Arabia to provide facts for its widely derided account of the death of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi, as Turkey vowed to reveal the \u201cnaked truth\u201d about what happened in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul earlier this month. In an attempt to ease growing western doubts about the credibility of the Saudi position, the foreign minister Adel Al-Jubeir told Fox News on Sunday that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman knew nothing of any plan to kill Khashoggi and that the whereabouts of his body remained a mystery to Riyadh. \u201cThis was an operation that was a rogue operation. This was an operation where individuals ended up exceeding the authorities and responsibilities they had,\u201d Jubeir told Fox. \u201cThey made the mistake when they killed Jamal Khashoggi in the consulate and they tried to cover up for it.\u201d Western governments have become increasingly dismissive of the often conflicting accounts of the journalist\u2019s death provided so far. In a joint statement released on Sunday, the UK, France and Germany said: \u201cThere remains an urgent need for clarification of exactly what happened on 2 October \u2013 beyond the hypotheses that have been raised so far in the Saudi investigation, which need to be backed by facts to be considered credible.\u201d The UK foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, spoke to Al-Jubeir on Sunday to convey the British view that \u201cnothing can justify this killing\u201d and assert that the explanation provided was not entirely credible. A Foreign Office source said: \u201cUltimately the strength of our response will depend on the extent to which the truth has been found, and our confidence that it cannot happen ever again.\u201d In his strongest comments to date on the case, the US president, Donald Trump, accused Saudi Arabia of lying about Khashoggi\u2019s death as pressure built on his administration to toughen its stance. Perhaps more ominously for the Saudis,Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, promised to provide on Tuesday full disclosure of the Turkish investigation into Khashoggi\u2019s killing. Up to now, the Turkish president and other senior government figures have remained cautious in their public statements, stopping short of pinning the blame on Saudi Arabia and referring instead to the prosecutors\u2019 investigation. Pro-government Turkish newspapers have released information detailing how a 15-member team was sent to Istanbul to confront Khashoggi at the consulate. It is alleged that Turkey has audio of his murder that would dispel Saudi suggestions he was killed inadvertently by throttling after resisting a plan by 15 Saudi officers to compel him to return to Riyadh. Erdo\u011fan told a rally in Istanbul: \u201cWe are looking for justice here and this will be revealed \u2026 not through some ordinary steps but in all its naked truth.\u201d After two weeks of contradictory statements, the Saudi government claimed late on Friday that Khashoggi was strangled after a fistfight broke out between him and officials on 2 October at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Five officials, including a senior intelligence officer, were said to have been fired and 18 others arrested.

The first was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/aug/09/marie-curie-tops-bbc-history-poll-of-women-who-changed-the-world\" title=\"\">Marie Curie</a>, in 1903; the second was the German-born US physicist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/occams-corner/2015/aug/11/women-science-nobel-prize-franklin-theatre\" title=\"\">Maria Goeppert-Mayer</a>, who won in 1963. The fact that female scientists are so often ignored by the Nobel committee, coupled with studies that show <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/head-quarters/2018/mar/08/bridging-the-gender-gap-why-do-so-few-girls-study-stem-subjects\" title=\"\">women in Stem (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) experience more discrimination</a>, ensured that a lot of the discussion around Strickland\u2019s prize concerned gender. News stories drew attention to the fact that, despite having received numerous accolades before her Nobel win, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/oct/03/donna-strickland-nobel-physics-prize-wikipedia-denied\" title=\"\">Strickland was not deemed worthy of a Wikipedia page</a> until this month (an attempt by a user to create a profile for her in March was denied by a moderator). Also highlighted was the fact that she was still an associate professor at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, rather than a full professor. It did not help that, in September, the Italian physicist Alessandro Strumia gave a conference lecture at Cern, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, in which he said men were now being discriminated against because of their gender and that physics was \u201cinvented and built by men\u201d. (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/oct/01/physics-was-built-by-men-cern-scientist-alessandro-strumia-remark-sparks-fury\" title=\"\">Cern subsequently suspended him</a>.)</p> <p>Strickland was surprised by the focus on gender. \u201cI know there is certainly a lot of effort right now being placed on equity, diversity and inclusivity,\u201d she says. \u201cWe consider that in our hiring practices and I\u2019ve sat on many of the hiring committees. I was on the board of the Canadian Association of Physicists and we really discussed, as a board, how to incorporate these ideas. So, I\u2019m certainly aware of the climate. But I don\u2019t see myself as a woman in science. I see myself as a scientist. I didn\u2019t think that would be the big story. I thought the big story would be the science.\u201d</p> <p>Strickland\u2019s focus has always been the science. She was born in Guelph, Ontario, a university town about an hour\u2019s drive from Toronto. Her father was an electrical engineer and her mother was an English teacher. According to family lore, when Strickland was a child, they took a trip to the then recently opened Ontario Science Centre. Her father showed her the museum\u2019s big laser, saying: \u201cYou\u2019ll want to see this. Lasers are the way of the future.\u201d Strickland barely remembers the trip, but evidently something sunk in. Later, when she enrolled as an undergraduate at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, she was torn between electrical engineering (lots of jobs) and physics (more fun). Fortunately, McMaster offered a hybrid programme \u2013 engineering physics \u2013 so she did not have to choose. Better yet, electro-optics and lasers was an area of study within the course. \u201cI was like: \u2018Oh my God, that sounds cool,\u2019\u201d Strickland says.</p> <p>When Strickland entered graduate school, the Canadian space programme was just starting up and her father often asked if she wanted to be an astronaut. No, she said, she was claustrophobic and afraid of heights \u2013 going into space sounded like a nightmare. All she wanted to do was stay in school. She was good at it, especially maths and science. When someone told her that a PhD was \u201cthe ultimate in school\u201d, that degree became her ambition. Despite a few years on the edge of academia after Rochester, she never really left school. In 1997, she was hired by Waterloo, where she now runs <a href=\"https://uwaterloo.ca/ultrafast-laser-group/\" title=\"\">the ultrafast laser group</a>, the goal of which is, essentially, to create lasers that people have never seen before.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A male student she\u00a0outperformed threatened to\u00a0\u2018pound\u2019 her. \u2018All\u00a0I\u00a0could think was: Girl beat you. Girl beat you bad\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>From her first Nobel press conference onwards, Strickland has insisted that she has been treated as an equal throughout her career; she has always been paid the same as her male colleagues, always been given the same opportunities. Her Nobel win is a symbol of progress, she says. Nonetheless, she has encountered men who share the defensive fragility demonstrated by Strumia in his Cern lecture. On one occasion during her undergraduate years, for example, a male student whom she had outperformed in a notoriously tough applied maths class was so furious that he threatened to \u201cpound\u201d her. Strickland was shocked, but also inwardly delighted: \u201cAll I could think was: \u2018Girl beat you. Girl beat you bad.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>A significant obstacle for women that she highlights is the \u201ctwo-body problem\u201d. Given that men outnumber women so heavily in physics, straight women who want to marry have a much wider choice among their colleagues then straight men do. If they marry a fellow physicist, however, it becomes almost impossible for the couple to find long-term university jobs at the same time, due to the relative scarcity of academic roles. Almost always, a wife\u2019s career is subordinated to her husband\u2019s \u2013 which is another reason for the smaller number of women in science.</p> <p>Strickland met her future husband, the electrical engineer and scientist Doug Dykaar, at university. (They have two university-age children: a son who is studying comedy and a daughter who is doing graduate work in astrophysics.) In the years following their marriage, Dykaar was able to get hired by universities, but there was never an additional position available for Strickland. That situation was reversed when Strickland was hired by Waterloo and Dykaar left academia for industry. \u201cEvery so often, he\u2019ll go: \u2018When is it my turn?\u2019\u201d Strickland says, laughing. \u201cBut I\u2019ve got tenure, Doug, so, when it\u2019s your turn, make sure it\u2019s really safe for us to travel [to another school].\u201d (She is a full-time tenured professor. The only reason she does not have the title of \u201cfull\u201d professor is because she has never applied for the rank. The university\u2019s president has said that, if she wanted to apply, her CV would need only be one line long: \u201cAwarded Nobel prize in physics, 2018.\u201d)</p> <p>Strickland would much rather talk about science than gender issues. When I ask her to describe some research she has done that is as cutting-edge as CPA, she launches into an impromptu, 10-minute lecture on a couple of experiments. I have not studied physics for about 30 years, so while I am more or less familiar with the words she uses \u2013 waveform, light, colour, intensity, pulse \u2013 her use and combination of them is baffling. She is patient, though, and almost giddy in her explanation \u2013 her eyes brighten, her smile never droops. She has said that her job is to impart her excitement about lasers to her students; in these few minutes, I feel a tingle of that excitement. </p> <p>Strickland clearly misses the classroom. She regrets that, with all the Nobel nonsense going on, she is able to spend only about an hour a day in her lab, checking in with her group. \u201cI\u2019m trying my best not to abandon them,\u201d she says. She will get back there eventually. In the meantime, there are more interviews, more photoshoots, more talks. She has to go shopping for ball gowns \u2013 three for herself, as well as ones for her daughter and her sister. There are a lot of events during Nobel week in December \u2013 balls, lectures, concerts, dinners, a meet-and-greet with the Swedish royal family. \u201cI\u2019ve asked a couple of other Nobel laureates for advice,\u201d Strickland says. \u201cThey all say the same thing: \u2018Pace yourself. You can only do so much.\u2019\u201d</p>",

I thought the big story would be the science.\u201d Strickland\u2019s focus has always been the science. She was born in Guelph, Ontario, a university town about an hour\u2019s drive from Toronto. Her father was an electrical engineer and her mother was an English teacher. According to family lore, when Strickland was a child, they took a trip to the then recently opened Ontario Science Centre. Her father showed her the museum\u2019s big laser, saying: \u201cYou\u2019ll want to see this. Lasers are the way of the future.\u201d Strickland barely remembers the trip, but evidently something sunk in. Later, when she enrolled as an undergraduate at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, she was torn between electrical engineering (lots of jobs) and physics (more fun). Fortunately, McMaster offered a hybrid programme \u2013 engineering physics \u2013 so she did not have to choose. Better yet, electro-optics and lasers was an area of study within the course. \u201cI was like: \u2018Oh my God, that sounds cool,\u2019\u201d Strickland says. When Strickland entered graduate school, the Canadian space programme was just starting up and her father often asked if she wanted to be an astronaut. No, she said, she was claustrophobic and afraid of heights \u2013 going into space sounded like a nightmare. All she wanted to do was stay in school. She was good at it, especially maths and science. When someone told her that a PhD was \u201cthe ultimate in school\u201d, that degree became her ambition. Despite a few years on the edge of academia after Rochester, she never really left school. In 1997, she was hired by Waterloo, where she now runs the ultrafast laser group, the goal of which is, essentially, to create lasers that people have never seen before. From her first Nobel press conference onwards, Strickland has insisted that she has been treated as an equal throughout her career; she has always been paid the same as her male colleagues, always been given the same opportunities. Her Nobel win is a symbol of progress, she says. Nonetheless, she has encountered men who share the defensive fragility demonstrated by Strumia in his Cern lecture. On one occasion during her undergraduate years, for example, a male student whom she had outperformed in a notoriously tough applied maths class was so furious that he threatened to \u201cpound\u201d her. Strickland was shocked, but also inwardly delighted: \u201cAll I could think was: \u2018Girl beat you. Girl beat you bad.\u2019\u201d A significant obstacle for women that she highlights is the \u201ctwo-body problem\u201d. Given that men outnumber women so heavily in physics, straight women who want to marry have a much wider choice among their colleagues then straight men do. If they marry a fellow physicist, however, it becomes almost impossible for the couple to find long-term university jobs at the same time, due to the relative scarcity of academic roles. Almost always, a wife\u2019s career is subordinated to her husband\u2019s \u2013 which is another reason for the smaller number of women in science. Strickland met her future husband, the electrical engineer and scientist Doug Dykaar, at university. (They have two university-age children: a son who is studying comedy and a daughter who is doing graduate work in astrophysics.) In the years following their marriage, Dykaar was able to get hired by universities, but there was never an additional position available for Strickland. That situation was reversed when Strickland was hired by Waterloo and Dykaar left academia for industry. \u201cEvery so often, he\u2019ll go: \u2018When is it my turn?\u2019\u201d Strickland says, laughing. \u201cBut I\u2019ve got tenure, Doug, so, when it\u2019s your turn, make sure it\u2019s really safe for us to travel [to another school].\u201d (She is a full-time tenured professor. The only reason she does not have the title of \u201cfull\u201d professor is because she has never applied for the rank. The university\u2019s president has said that, if she wanted to apply, her CV would need only be one line long: \u201cAwarded Nobel prize in physics, 2018.\u201d) Strickland would much rather talk about science than gender issues. When I ask her to describe some research she has done that is as cutting-edge as CPA, she launches into an impromptu, 10-minute lecture on a couple of experiments. I have not studied physics for about 30 years, so while I am more or less familiar with the words she uses \u2013 waveform, light, colour, intensity, pulse \u2013 her use and combination of them is baffling. She is patient, though, and almost giddy in her explanation \u2013 her eyes brighten, her smile never droops. She has said that her job is to impart her excitement about lasers to her students; in these few minutes, I feel a tingle of that excitement. Strickland clearly misses the classroom. She regrets that, with all the Nobel nonsense going on, she is able to spend only about an hour a day in her lab, checking in with her group. \u201cI\u2019m trying my best not to abandon them,\u201d she says. She will get back there eventually. In the meantime, there are more interviews, more photoshoots, more talks. She has to go shopping for ball gowns \u2013 three for herself, as well as ones for her daughter and her sister. There are a lot of events during Nobel week in December \u2013 balls, lectures, concerts, dinners, a meet-and-greet with the Swedish royal family. \u201cI\u2019ve asked a couple of other Nobel laureates for advice,\u201d Strickland says. \u201cThey all say the same thing: \u2018Pace yourself. You can only do so much.\u2019\u201d",

Big business has listened. California\u2019s famed Napa Valley and Sonoma County are sprouting marijuana estates. The state of Colorado has garnered almost<a href=\"https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/revenue/colorado-marijuana-tax-data\" title=\"\"> $1bn</a> in taxes from cannabis sales over five years, most of it going to schools. The biggest breakthrough is expected when production moves from weed for smoking to cannabis for eating and drinking. One company in Los Angeles is already marketing <a href=\"https://definitelynotrebelcoastwinery.com/#\" title=\"\">cannabis-infused sauvignon</a>.</p> \n<p>It is now 64 years since three men became the last people to be imprisoned in Britain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jul/14/against-the-law-the-wildeblood-scandal-the-case-that-rocked-1950s-britain-and-changed-gay-rights\" title=\"\">for the earlier taboo of criminal homosexuality</a>. They were victims of home secretary Sir David Maxwell Fyfe\u2019s campaign to \u201crid England of this male vice \u2026 this plague\u201d. Within 15 years homosexuality was legal, and Britain moved into the progressive lane. It prided itself on reforms to laws surrounding abortion, divorce, theatre censorship and racial abuse. Tragically, that is not true today. I wonder who will be the last Briton imprisoned for a cannabis offence \u2013 some 30,000 people have spent time in police custody in the past five years.</p> \n<p>The charity Transform estimates that <a href=\"https://www.tdpf.org.uk/sites/default/files/Transform-submission-titan-prisons-consultation.pdf\" title=\"\">half of all acquisitive crime</a> is due to the illegality of the drugs industry. The police claim an astonishing 95% of marijuana consumed in Britain is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/01/skunk-criminalisation-drugs-reform\" title=\"\">high-strength skunk</a>, heavily promoted by dealers. Drug-related deaths are rising, not falling.</p> \n<p>Like a Home Office metronome, the home secretary Sajid Javid earlier this month announced yet another futile \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/02/sajid-javid-pledges-to-get-tough-on-middle-class-cocaine-users\" title=\"\">clampdown</a>\u201d, this time on middle-class drug users. He would \u201ctarget\u201d their suppliers by \u201cholding a review\u201d. The same day as this desperate bid for a headline, bankers gathered in a Mayfair hotel to hear about investment opportunities in the new global industry, possibly worth $200bn a year, from which Javid wants Britain locked out. Cannabis products would soon transform agriculture, pharmaceuticals, mental health and <a href=\"https://research.rabobank.com/far/en/sectors/beverages/three-reasons-wine-could-be-hurt-by-marijuana-legalization.html\" title=\"\">the drinks trade</a>. They could possibly outsell beer. </p> \n<p>Canada is hardly a nation of rabid potheads and hippies. It is a calm, secure and tolerant society. Justin Trudeau understands, as Britain does not, that easing up on possession is not the point. Anyone who wants drugs can get them. The question is how, and from whom. The damage to society lies in criminalising supply, tipping huge sums into the pockets of violent crooks. I recall some years ago being menaced by two dealers outside an event on drugs legalisation, who said, \u201cYou lot just want to do us out of business.\u201d Prohibition has been their friend.</p> \n<p>While Americans are spinning their weed wheels and going to sommelier classes, British buyers are left to the mercy of pub lavatories and grubby street corners.

          "bodyText": "Are you an interpener, a budtender or just a cannasseur? Do you go for indica or ruderalis? How do like your trichomes? Would you give Dad a cannador, or marry a weed sommelier? Do you read Weed Spectator? The jargon of America\u2019s now-booming marijuana industry took a boost this week as Canada became the first G7 nation to legalise cannabis nationwide. Shops opened their doors and investors rushed into \u201cpot stocks\u201d. The premier Justin Trudeau said simply: \u201cThe war on drugs is not working.\u201d Urgent action was required to get cannabis \u2018\u201cout of the hands of our children, to tax it and regulate it\u201d. A covert but massive $7bn industry has gone legit. Sensible people know that a product in demand is better brought under control than left to flourish underground. The future is clear. With recreational cannabis already legal in nine US states, polls show a majority of Americans now consider it \u201csafer\u201d than alcohol. Big business has listened. California\u2019s famed Napa Valley and Sonoma County are sprouting marijuana estates. The state of Colorado has garnered almost $1bn in taxes from cannabis sales over five years, most of it going to schools. The biggest breakthrough is expected when production moves from weed for smoking to cannabis for eating and drinking. One company in Los Angeles is already marketing cannabis-infused sauvignon. It is now 64 years since three men became the last people to be imprisoned in Britain for the earlier taboo of criminal homosexuality. They were victims of home secretary Sir David Maxwell Fyfe\u2019s campaign to \u201crid England of this male vice \u2026 this plague\u201d. Within 15 years homosexuality was legal, and Britain moved into the progressive lane. It prided itself on reforms to laws surrounding abortion, divorce, theatre censorship and racial abuse. Tragically, that is not true today. I wonder who will be the last Briton imprisoned for a cannabis offence \u2013 some 30,000 people have spent time in police custody in the past five years. The charity Transform estimates that half of all acquisitive crime is due to the illegality of the drugs industry. The police claim an astonishing 95% of marijuana consumed in Britain is high-strength skunk, heavily promoted by dealers. Drug-related deaths are rising, not falling. Like a Home Office metronome, the home secretary Sajid Javid earlier this month announced yet another futile \u201cclampdown\u201d, this time on middle-class drug users. He would \u201ctarget\u201d their suppliers by \u201cholding a review\u201d. The same day as this desperate bid for a headline, bankers gathered in a Mayfair hotel to hear about investment opportunities in the new global industry, possibly worth $200bn a year, from which Javid wants Britain locked out. Cannabis products would soon transform agriculture, pharmaceuticals, mental health and the drinks trade. They could possibly outsell beer. Canada is hardly a nation of rabid potheads and hippies. It is a calm, secure and tolerant society. Justin Trudeau understands, as Britain does not, that easing up on possession is not the point. Anyone who wants drugs can get them. The question is how, and from whom. The damage to society lies in criminalising supply, tipping huge sums into the pockets of violent crooks. I recall some years ago being menaced by two dealers outside an event on drugs legalisation, who said, \u201cYou lot just want to do us out of business.\u201d Prohibition has been their friend. While Americans are spinning their weed wheels and going to sommelier classes, British buyers are left to the mercy of pub lavatories and grubby street corners. While Canadian consumers can sit in saloons and cafes, safe in the knowledge that what they enjoy is inspected and tested, Britons must run the gauntlet of violent gangs, proliferating from cities to rural \u201ccounty lines\u201d. Their activities contribute nothing to the state, and cost it a fortune. Ten years after medicinal cannabis was everywhere abroad, it took a personal tragedy and a tabloid campaign to permit the Home Office to allow it in Britain. It was a cynical display of what it takes to get Whitehall to change its mind.

          "body": "<h2><strong>When can I buy </strong>marijuana<strong>?</strong></h2> \n<p>17 October 2018.</p> \n<p>The government had intended for recreational marijuana use to be legalized by 1 July 2018. Bill C-45, the Cannabis Act, passed its third reading in the House of Commons last fall, and Trudeau has emphasised that it will be implemented without delay.</p> \n<p>But the bill is still under scrutiny in the Senate, which has repeatedly threatened to send it back to the House for amendment. Some indigenous leaders have also expressed concern that the act does not allow them to regulate or ban the sale of pot on their land as they can with alcohol, and that \u2013 in violation of section 35 of the constitution \u2013 they were never consulted about these legislative changes. Both challenges could delay legalization until parliament\u2019s fall sitting.</p> \n<p>But whenever legalization does occur, don\u2019t expect to rush out and buy anything that day. The government anticipates a two- or three-month transition period before cannabis may be legally bought or sold.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"62883908-47c3-4d07-8d2b-36c554df674a\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RAgkW_Rp2ks?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Where can I buy it?</strong></h2> \n<p>Because the details of legalization have fallen to the provinces, that depends on where you are in Canada. In Alberta, recreational cannabis will be widely available at 17 private retailers across the province, while in Ontario sales will be exclusively online until later in the year. Most of the other provinces are a blend of these two approaches; in Newfoundland and Labrador, you will be able to buy weed at stores run by the province\u2019s liquor board. Few of the country\u2019s suddenly ubiquitous (and illegal) marijuana dispensaries are likely to survive the transition to licensed retailing.</p> \n<h2><strong>How will I know what I\u2019m buying?</strong></h2> \n<p>Health Canada guidelines stipulate that packaging has to list all the information a consumer needs to make an informed decision, including the name of the producer, the name of the marijuana strain, and its THC/CBD content. This includes a large disclaimer about the health risks associated with pot. For maximum safety, product packaging is designed to be so terrifyingly bland that no one would ever accidentally mistake its contents for something fun.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b7c86f70d5e632b41634435878f96f26dc7add81\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b7c86f70d5e632b41634435878f96f26dc7add81/0_71_3840_2300/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kiva Confections sells chocolate cannabis products at the Marijuana Business Conference and Expo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"599\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kiva Confections sells chocolate cannabis products at the Marijuana Business Conference and Expo in 2015.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alyssa Schukar/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>How much weed can I have?</strong></h2> \n<p>Adults are allowed to carry up to 30g of dried cannabis (or its equivalent) in a \u201cpublic space\u201d, which means that\u2019s all you can buy at any one time. Note that \u201cpublic space\u201d includes your personal vehicle. If you\u2019re caught out in public with more than 30g, you can face up to five years in prison.</p> \n<h2><strong>Can I bake it into brownies?</strong></h2> \n<p>You are free to consume your marijuana recreationally in any manner you see fit, so long as you keep it away from children. (New Brunswick will also require you to store your weed in a locked room or container, not unlike a firearm.)</p> \n<p>But you won\u2019t be able to buy pre-made edibles or other marijuana extracts until exactly one year after the Cannabis Act comes into effect, sometime in 2019.</p> \n<h2><strong>Can I drive high?</strong></h2> \n<p>No! This is a bad idea for a number of reasons, foremost being that it is both dangerous and illegal. Under the Liberals\u2019 proposed inclusion of stoned driving under the criminal code, bill C-46, THC levels of five nanograms per millilitre of blood are penalized in three tiers: a minimum fine of $1,000 for the first offence; minimum 30 days\u2019 imprisonment for a second offence; and a minimum of 120 days in jail for the third and any subsequent offences. These penalties get significantly steeper if you maim or kill anybody, from two years to life behind bars. Less than 5ng but more than 2.5ng could mean a fine of up to $1,000.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/14/should-i-grow-my-own-marijuana-how-what-to-do-tips\">Should I grow my own weed at home? Here's what you need to know</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Proving marijuana impairment is more difficult. Unlike booze, there is no breathalyzer for pot, nor is there a clear consensus about how high is too high to drive.

          "bodyText": "When can I buy marijuana? 17 October 2018. The government had intended for recreational marijuana use to be legalized by 1 July 2018. Bill C-45, the Cannabis Act, passed its third reading in the House of Commons last fall, and Trudeau has emphasised that it will be implemented without delay. But the bill is still under scrutiny in the Senate, which has repeatedly threatened to send it back to the House for amendment. Some indigenous leaders have also expressed concern that the act does not allow them to regulate or ban the sale of pot on their land as they can with alcohol, and that \u2013 in violation of section 35 of the constitution \u2013 they were never consulted about these legislative changes. Both challenges could delay legalization until parliament\u2019s fall sitting. But whenever legalization does occur, don\u2019t expect to rush out and buy anything that day. The government anticipates a two- or three-month transition period before cannabis may be legally bought or sold. Where can I buy it? Because the details of legalization have fallen to the provinces, that depends on where you are in Canada. In Alberta, recreational cannabis will be widely available at 17 private retailers across the province, while in Ontario sales will be exclusively online until later in the year. Most of the other provinces are a blend of these two approaches; in Newfoundland and Labrador, you will be able to buy weed at stores run by the province\u2019s liquor board. Few of the country\u2019s suddenly ubiquitous (and illegal) marijuana dispensaries are likely to survive the transition to licensed retailing. How will I know what I\u2019m buying? Health Canada guidelines stipulate that packaging has to list all the information a consumer needs to make an informed decision, including the name of the producer, the name of the marijuana strain, and its THC/CBD content. This includes a large disclaimer about the health risks associated with pot. For maximum safety, product packaging is designed to be so terrifyingly bland that no one would ever accidentally mistake its contents for something fun. How much weed can I have? Adults are allowed to carry up to 30g of dried cannabis (or its equivalent) in a \u201cpublic space\u201d, which means that\u2019s all you can buy at any one time. Note that \u201cpublic space\u201d includes your personal vehicle. If you\u2019re caught out in public with more than 30g, you can face up to five years in prison. Can I bake it into brownies? You are free to consume your marijuana recreationally in any manner you see fit, so long as you keep it away from children. (New Brunswick will also require you to store your weed in a locked room or container, not unlike a firearm.) But you won\u2019t be able to buy pre-made edibles or other marijuana extracts until exactly one year after the Cannabis Act comes into effect, sometime in 2019. Can I drive high? No! This is a bad idea for a number of reasons, foremost being that it is both dangerous and illegal. Under the Liberals\u2019 proposed inclusion of stoned driving under the criminal code, bill C-46, THC levels of five nanograms per millilitre of blood are penalized in three tiers: a minimum fine of $1,000 for the first offence; minimum 30 days\u2019 imprisonment for a second offence; and a minimum of 120 days in jail for the third and any subsequent offences. These penalties get significantly steeper if you maim or kill anybody, from two years to life behind bars. Less than 5ng but more than 2.5ng could mean a fine of up to $1,000. Proving marijuana impairment is more difficult. Unlike booze, there is no breathalyzer for pot, nor is there a clear consensus about how high is too high to drive. Alcohol is metabolized at a standard rate, but THC affects users differently depending on their age, genetic background, size, history of use and method of ingestion, and it remains detectable in urine for days, weeks or months after. Currently, police officers can only order a standardized field sobriety test to drivers they suspect may be intoxicated. If the driver fails, they can demand a further 12-step drug recognition expert evaluation; the expert gauges impairment and orders further blood or saliva tests. C-46 would grant officers the power to do mandatory breathalyzer testing on any lawfully stopped car, and they can demand roadside testing of oral fluid if they suspect a driver is high. They can also pre-emptively demand blood samples if they order a DRE evaluation. (It is worth mentioning that a CBC investigation found DRE testing was unscientific, roughly as accurate as a coin flip and prone to false arrests.) C-46 would also increase maximum sentencing for impaired driving offences, from a minimum of 14 years to life in prison in cases causing bodily harm or death. These heightened penalties mean impaired driving offences now fall under the category of \u201cserious criminality\u201d in Canadian law. This means foreign nationals with a previous conviction can be barred from entering the country, and permanent residents in Canada charged with a single impaired driving offence could potentially face deportation. Driving high is not the worth the risk. I live in a rural area and my neighbour wants to buy a couple of grams from me to save a trip to town. Is that OK? Absolutely not. Unless you are a licensed retailer, it is illegal for one adult to sell cannabis to another. Anyone found selling marijuana without a license will face fines up to $5,000 or up to 14 years in prison. You are, however, allowed to freely share your drugs with your friends. Can I give some to the bright and earnest 16-year-old next door in desperate need of escape from their broken home and/or crushing suburban ennui? Providing a minor with even so much as the shake from the bottom of your bag risks you a $5,000 fine, or up to 14 years in jail. Can I grow my own? Federal guidelines allow recreational users to grow up to four plants per household, up to a metre tall. Most provinces have acceded to this suggestion, with some (like British Columbia) stipulating that the plants must be grown in a secure location out of public view. In Manitoba and Quebec, however, home growing is illegal. Landlords in some provinces are also pushing for the right to ban tenants from growing cannabis in their rental properties. Also: do not move your plants while they\u2019re budding or flowering! Appearing in a public space with a blooming cannabis plant nets you a fine up to $5,000, or five years behind bars. Can I smoke weed at work? Your employer has final authority on drug policy in the workplace. Legalization isn\u2019t anarchy. If you can\u2019t stagger into work after a liquid lunch at the pub, don\u2019t expect to spark a spliff on your smoke break.

(The rules are different if you use medicinal cannabis. Employers are required by law to accommodate medicinal users the same as they would anyone else with a disability or medical condition requiring prescription drugs. This rarely implies carte blanche to smoke on the job, however. Consult your employer for details.) Can I smoke in my house? Marijuana faces most of the same restrictions as public smoking, with additional proscriptions against public intoxication. In many parts of Canada, your home may be the only place you can legally smoke pot in peace. Unless you\u2019re renting. Many provinces (including Alberta, Saskatchewan and Ontario) are moving to grant landlords the power to ban smoking weed in their residences as part of the lease, in the same way that they can ban tobacco.

Only purchases from officially recognized stores will be legal: someone selling a few ounces to a friend could still face fines or even jail time. Giving marijuana to a minor remains illegal, so an 18-year-old sharing marijuana with a 17-year-old could in theory face a maximum sentence of 14 years in jail. \u201cThe danger in this is that people are going to go out and think that they\u2019re using a legal substance and will use it in a variety of ways that may seem innocuous, but could result in criminal charges,\u201d said Deshman.

Top story: Thousands flee as Hurricane Michael nears Florida Hurricane Michael has strengthened into a category 4 storm as it barrels across the Gulf of Mexico towards the Florida Panhandle, where it is expected to make landfall on Wednesday. More than 20 million people in five states were under a hurricane or tropical storm warning on Tuesday evening as Michael bore down on the US coastline, having killed at least 13 people in the Caribbean and Central America. - Threat to life. Michael threatens to be one of the most dangerous storms to strike the Panhandle in decades, with an expected storm surge of up to 13ft and winds of 120mph. - Climate denier?

Nikki Haley\u2019s abrupt departure sparks fevered speculation No sooner had the unexpected news leaked that Nikki Haley would be announcing her exit from the Trump administration on Tuesday than the rumours began: would the former South Carolina governor run for president in 2020? Would Ivanka Trump replace Haley as her father\u2019s ambassador to the UN? Both suggestions were swiftly denied, but the question remains: why would one of the administration\u2019s few arguably credible figures step down within weeks of the crucial midterms? - Glamour role.

Finding it hard to keep up with who has left the Trump White House and why? Here\u2019s our roundup of the firings and resignations so far. Scholars warn Kavanaugh battle could damage supreme court The controversy over Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation to the supreme court will do lasting harm to the institution, leading law scholars have warned. Kavanaugh\u2019s apparent partisan bias, and accusations of historic sexual misconduct \u2013 which he has vehemently denied \u2013 will lead to persistent demands that he recuse himself from cases involving sexual violence and party-political partisanship, as Ed Pilkington reports. - Unwanted attention. Meanwhile, Kavanaugh\u2019s accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, may never escape the discomfort of the spotlight. She faces \u201cvile hatred\u201d from critics and hero worship from supporters, writes Janell Ross. Khashoggi case: CCTV footage \u2018vanishes\u2019 from Saudi consulate Security camera footage disappeared and local Turkish staff were ordered to take the day off from the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on the day the dissident Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi vanished, say Turkish investigators. Khashoggi is alleged to have been murdered by a Saudi hit squad while visiting the consulate, with observers speculating he was killed in an operation sanctioned by the Riyadh regime. - Critics at risk. As Khashoggi becomes its latest alleged victim, Emma Graham-Harrison writes that opponents of the Saudi regime are at risk in Riyadh and beyond.

How to declutter your digital life You may have tidied your desk, but have you cleaned up all that loose data on your laptop? Alex Hern offers five simple ways for \u201ccyber-hoarders\u201d to declutter their devices. What would an age-friendly city look like? As the world\u2019s population grows older and moves increasingly towards the big cities, Alice Grahame asks how our urban centres can adapt to an influx of over-60s. Opinion Supposedly one of Donald Trump\u2019s more effective and independent lieutenants, Nikki Haley missed her chance to speak truth to the president with her gushing resignation announcement, argues Richard Wolffe. Perhaps at some point Trump\u2019s former officials will seek redemption by claiming they were suckered by a strange temporary sickness into salivating all over his disastrous leadership.

Three years later, Canada\u2019s prime minister is on the defensive, scrambling to both revive his party\u2019s unravelling climate strategy as a growing number of provinces refuse to participate in national carbon tax \u2013 and to temper frustrations over his government\u2019s continued investment in the fossil fuel industry. \u201cFrom the beginning, [the government] decided they were going to try to thread the needle on the need for climate policy and fossil fuel resource development. They even made the two interdependent,\u201d said Matthew Hoffman, a political science professor at Toronto\u2019s Munk School of Global Affairs. But on the surface, the strategy appears to be quickly falling apart. Trudeau\u2019s political foes have already seized on the carbon tax in anticipation of the upcoming federal election \u2013 still a full year away \u2013 but the prime minister has shown no signs of backing down. \u201cPollution should not be free anywhere across this country,\u201d he said last week. The political infighting comes as the UN\u2019s intergovernmental panel on climate change warned that drastic changes are needed to offset the impacts of global climate change. As part of a strategy to reduce Canada\u2019s emissions, provinces are required to introduce a tax of at least $20 per tonne on emissions from January 2019, with increments of $10 each year until 2022. In provinces which fail to produce an adequate carbon pricing plan, the federal government would implement its own tax, or \u201cbackstop\u201d. Last week, Manitoba became the fifth province to publicly opt out of carbon pricing, arguing that its own plans to combat climate change were sufficient. Saskatchewan, which still relies heavily on coal for its power, has called the carbon tax a \u201cransom note\u201d. In Ontario, Canada\u2019s most populous province, the rightwing premier, Doug Ford, has vowed to rally opposition to the measure, which he described as \u201cthe worst tax ever\u201d. Alberta, home to the country\u2019s oil sands, announced it would leave the plan after the federal government failed to push through construction of the Trans Mountain expansion pipeline \u2013 a project Alberta argued was critical to its economy. \u201cUntil the federal government gets its act together, Alberta is pulling out of the federal climate plan,\u201d said Premier Rachel Notley in August. \u201cAnd let\u2019s be clear, without Alberta, that plan isn\u2019t worth the paper it\u2019s written on.\u201d Only two provinces, British Columbia and Quebec, have signalled a willingness to remain in some form of carbon pricing agreement. When the original agreement was laid out, many of the provinces had Liberal politicians in power. Now, a conservative wave across the country has changed the party in power \u2013 and the political calculus. \u201cThis is a political move by the provinces.

For almost a year, his mother, Iokarenhtha Thomas, who lives in the Six Nations of the Grand River indigenous reserve in Ontario, went to the local doctor for lotions for the boy. It worked, for a time. But the itchy red rash always returned. Thomas came to suspect the culprit behind the rash: water \u2013 or, rather, the lack of it.</p> <p>Thomas, a university student and mother of five, has lived without running tap water since the age of 16. Her children lack access to things commonplace elsewhere, like toilets, showers and baths.

Drought and other environmental problems are supposed to be addressed during the granting of new water permits. That\u2019s when scientific and legal experts examine fish populations, vegetation and aquifer levels to decide how much well water can be safely extracted.</p> <p>It\u2019s not happening. There\u2019s been a moratorium on new permits since 2016 \u2013 yet, paradoxically, the Ontario government has also given companies the right to pump water on expired permits until 2019. (The permit for the Erin site expired in 2017.)</p> <p>Maka\u015ba Looking Horse, 21, a student in indigenous studies at McMaster University, has organized a community-wide march for this fall. She has also organized a boycott of Nestl\u00e9\u2019s products. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to boycott Nestl\u00e9 because they own so many companies that sell so many products,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to pick and choose. You don\u2019t always know what\u2019s Nestl\u00e9 and what\u2019s not because they own so much.\u201d</p> <p>This is not the first time Nestl\u00e9 has found itself in such difficulties. In fact, numerous conflicts have surfaced related to their business model, according to Peter Gleick, co-founder and president emeritus of the Pacific Institute, a global water thinktank, and author of <a href=\"https://islandpress.org/books/bottled-and-sold\">Bottled and Sold: The Story Behind Our Obsession with Bottled Water</a>.</p> <p>Many of Nestl\u00e9\u2019s competitors, such as Aquafina and Dasani, don\u2019t use spring water, but filter and treat tap water, Gleick said. But Nestl\u00e9 was founded in the 19th century on the idea that spring water might have incredible health benefits. Nestl\u00e9 bottles its brands \u2013 including Arrowhead, Poland Spring, Deer Park, Ozarka, Zephyrhills, Acqua Panna, San Pellegrino, Perrier, Vittel and Buxton \u2013 from deep aquifers and natural springs, which can take decades or longer to replenish.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e1c1a27917f7236033ba1edd646c4da3a89d59da\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e1c1a27917f7236033ba1edd646c4da3a89d59da/0_269_3744_6253/599.jpg\" alt=\"Ken Greene gathers water for his home.\" width=\"599\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ken Greene gathers water for his home.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jennifer Roberts/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For the past century, demand for freshwater has grown twice as fast as population growth, explained Steven Solomon, author of <a href=\"https://www.harpercollins.com/9780060548308/water/\">Water: The Epic Struggle for Wealth, Power and Civilization</a>. The United Nations predicts that by 2025, 1.8 billion people will live with dire water shortages, and two-thirds of the world\u2019s population could be living under stressed water conditions. That means a race to find untapped springs.</p> <p>Anticipating shortages, companies like Nestl\u00e9 are trying to lock in as much of the world\u2019s water as possible, explained Solomon. Bottled water is the world\u2019s most popular drink, and its sales recently outstripped soft drinks, according to a study by Beverage Marketing Corp. The trend is expected to intensify. The higher temperatures predicted with climate change will lead to less water and more thirst. \u201cDemand is rising,\u201d Solomon said. \u201cThe curve is rising a lot. And they are trying to tie up supply.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe fact that Nestl\u00e9 is commercializing these natural resources in a community that doesn\u2019t have access to reliable safe, affordable drinking water is a stunning example of the disparities we see around the world in access to safe water,\u201d Gleick said. \u201cThe rich can pay for water and the poor get shortchanged over and over again.\u201d</p> <p>The former CEO of Nestl\u00e9, Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, caused an international furor when he praised the commodification of water in a 2005 documentary, saying: \u201cOne perspective held by various NGOs \u2013 which I would call extreme \u2013 is that water should be declared a human right \u2026 The other view is that water is a grocery product. And just as every other product, it should have a market value.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\" data-alt=\"rule\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\">rule</a> </figure>  <p><strong>While the lack of water</strong> in indigenous communities has been carefully documented, the full impact on the health and mental wellbeing of indigenous residents has not.</p> <p>Eager for answers, McMaster University professor Martin-Hill is conducting a three-year interdisciplinary study examining the impact of contaminated water and lack of water on humans, as well as fish and wildlife. \u201cWe need to know what is going on. Because what is happening with our water is a systemic, institutional assault on indigenous people\u2019s lands and rights over those lands to protect and preserve them.\u201d</p> <p>Martin-Hill believes that the exorbitant suicide rate among First Nations youth \u2013 five to seven times that of other Canadians, according to the federal government \u2013 is directly related to the lack of drinkable water. For a Six Nations person, water is sacred and a symbol of life. But the lack also has metaphorical significance, as it becomes representative of the myriad ways that indigenous Canadians are treated as second-class citizens.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5b4b8d5a325e271d32e8a8a16370d54f6c7cf225\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b4b8d5a325e271d32e8a8a16370d54f6c7cf225/0_781_5484_3582/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Larry Jamieson collects water.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"653\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Larry Jamieson collects water.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jennifer Roberts/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe young people are upset, pissed and demoralized,\u201d Martin-Hill said. \u201cThere\u2019s a strong element of depression, sadness and hopelessness because it\u2019s been going on for so long. Young people don\u2019t see a future.\u201d</p> <p>At Six Nations, the water situation is improving, albeit slowly. In 2013, the community received a $41m grant to build a state-of-the-art water treatment plant. Unfortunately, the grant did not cover the cost of plumbing, so it serves only 9% of homes.</p> <p>\u201cWe had to take out a loan for $12m to come up with the final dollars needed,\u201d Chief Ava Hill said. \u201cIn addition, they have not provided sufficient operation and maintenance dollars for us to run the plant. The challenges of gaining money for infrastructure on reserves is that the federal government simply does not provide enough dollars even though they have the fiduciary responsibility to do so.\u201d</p> <p>With the election of Justin Trudeau, the tide seemed to shift somewhat. The prime minister promised to improve First Nations prosperity and solve the bad water issue on indigenous reserves by March 2021.</p> <p>While there has been some progress, there aren\u2019t sufficient funds. The Liberal government earmarked $1.8bn over five years to solve the water issue. But the real cost is estimated at $3.2bn, leaving the government more than $1bn short.</p> <p>For Thomas, the inequality between indigenous people\u2019s access to drinking water and everyone else didn\u2019t start with water, but far earlier, with land displacement and colonialism. For her, it is the latest example of an ongoing cultural genocide. When thinking about how she will survive another day without drinking water, she remembers how her family has survived in the past.</p> <p>\u201cWe are taught to be resilient,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not right, but it\u2019s just a reality. You have to tell yourself: \u2018This is just the way it is.\u2019 Otherwise you become angry and bitter.\u201d</p>",

For almost a year, his mother, Iokarenhtha Thomas, who lives in the Six Nations of the Grand River indigenous reserve in Ontario, went to the local doctor for lotions for the boy. It worked, for a time. But the itchy red rash always returned. Thomas came to suspect the culprit behind the rash: water \u2013 or, rather, the lack of it. Thomas, a university student and mother of five, has lived without running tap water since the age of 16. Her children lack access to things commonplace elsewhere, like toilets, showers and baths. For washing and toilet usage, they use a bucket. It is a challenging existence, full of frustration, exhaustion and health problems, and reminiscent of life in some developing countries.

Twice a week, Thomas and her husband grab jugs, pails and whatever else they have in the house, and drive 8km to a public tap to fill up. The water isn\u2019t drinkable, however, so once a week they also drive 10km to the nearest town, Caledonia, to buy bottled water to drink. \u201cWhen my husband isn\u2019t here, it makes it difficult to do the dishes or anything because I don\u2019t have the strength to carry all the jugs of water,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cWhen I start to compare my life to someone who isn\u2019t living on reserve, I start feeling angry at the government,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause our people don\u2019t have running water.

In response, the Six Nations are suing the province, in a case before the superior court of Ontario. \u201cWe are working hard on developing our relationships with local First Nations communities, and look forward to working together,\u201d Jennifer Kerr, director of corporate affairs for Nestl\u00e9 Waters Canada, wrote in an email to the Guardian. \u201cEverything has to do with the water,\u201d explained Ken Greene, 53, who lives with his wife in a one-bedroom trailer without running water. \u201cBecause it has to do with the land. Land needs water. We need water. We can\u2019t survive without it.\u201d The disputed Erin well is located in a drought-stricken area, explained Emma Lui, a water campaigner with the Council of Canadians, a progressive not-for-profit that works on environmental causes. The drought has dried the wetlands surrounding Greene\u2019s 10-acre property. It has also decimated the local populations of salmon, trout, pike and pickerel, Greene said. Martin-Hill told me that indigenous leaders can do little to address the drought because they are caught in a legal trap. Drought and other environmental problems are supposed to be addressed during the granting of new water permits. That\u2019s when scientific and legal experts examine fish populations, vegetation and aquifer levels to decide how much well water can be safely extracted. It\u2019s not happening. There\u2019s been a moratorium on new permits since 2016 \u2013 yet, paradoxically, the Ontario government has also given companies the right to pump water on expired permits until 2019. (The permit for the Erin site expired in 2017.) Maka\u015ba Looking Horse, 21, a student in indigenous studies at McMaster University, has organized a community-wide march for this fall. She has also organized a boycott of Nestl\u00e9\u2019s products. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to boycott Nestl\u00e9 because they own so many companies that sell so many products,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to pick and choose. You don\u2019t always know what\u2019s Nestl\u00e9 and what\u2019s not because they own so much.\u201d This is not the first time Nestl\u00e9 has found itself in such difficulties. In fact, numerous conflicts have surfaced related to their business model, according to Peter Gleick, co-founder and president emeritus of the Pacific Institute, a global water thinktank, and author of Bottled and Sold: The Story Behind Our Obsession with Bottled Water. Many of Nestl\u00e9\u2019s competitors, such as Aquafina and Dasani, don\u2019t use spring water, but filter and treat tap water, Gleick said. But Nestl\u00e9 was founded in the 19th century on the idea that spring water might have incredible health benefits. Nestl\u00e9 bottles its brands \u2013 including Arrowhead, Poland Spring, Deer Park, Ozarka, Zephyrhills, Acqua Panna, San Pellegrino, Perrier, Vittel and Buxton \u2013 from deep aquifers and natural springs, which can take decades or longer to replenish. For the past century, demand for freshwater has grown twice as fast as population growth, explained Steven Solomon, author of Water: The Epic Struggle for Wealth, Power and Civilization. The United Nations predicts that by 2025, 1.8 billion people will live with dire water shortages, and two-thirds of the world\u2019s population could be living under stressed water conditions. That means a race to find untapped springs. Anticipating shortages, companies like Nestl\u00e9 are trying to lock in as much of the world\u2019s water as possible, explained Solomon. Bottled water is the world\u2019s most popular drink, and its sales recently outstripped soft drinks, according to a study by Beverage Marketing Corp. The trend is expected to intensify. The higher temperatures predicted with climate change will lead to less water and more thirst. \u201cDemand is rising,\u201d Solomon said. \u201cThe curve is rising a lot. And they are trying to tie up supply.\u201d \u201cThe fact that Nestl\u00e9 is commercializing these natural resources in a community that doesn\u2019t have access to reliable safe, affordable drinking water is a stunning example of the disparities we see around the world in access to safe water,\u201d Gleick said. \u201cThe rich can pay for water and the poor get shortchanged over and over again.\u201d The former CEO of Nestl\u00e9, Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, caused an international furor when he praised the commodification of water in a 2005 documentary, saying: \u201cOne perspective held by various NGOs \u2013 which I would call extreme \u2013 is that water should be declared a human right \u2026 The other view is that water is a grocery product. And just as every other product, it should have a market value.\u201d While the lack of water in indigenous communities has been carefully documented, the full impact on the health and mental wellbeing of indigenous residents has not. Eager for answers, McMaster University professor Martin-Hill is conducting a three-year interdisciplinary study examining the impact of contaminated water and lack of water on humans, as well as fish and wildlife. \u201cWe need to know what is going on. Because what is happening with our water is a systemic, institutional assault on indigenous people\u2019s lands and rights over those lands to protect and preserve them.\u201d Martin-Hill believes that the exorbitant suicide rate among First Nations youth \u2013 five to seven times that of other Canadians, according to the federal government \u2013 is directly related to the lack of drinkable water. For a Six Nations person, water is sacred and a symbol of life. But the lack also has metaphorical significance, as it becomes representative of the myriad ways that indigenous Canadians are treated as second-class citizens. \u201cThe young people are upset, pissed and demoralized,\u201d Martin-Hill said. \u201cThere\u2019s a strong element of depression, sadness and hopelessness because it\u2019s been going on for so long. Young people don\u2019t see a future.\u201d At Six Nations, the water situation is improving, albeit slowly. In 2013, the community received a $41m grant to build a state-of-the-art water treatment plant. Unfortunately, the grant did not cover the cost of plumbing, so it serves only 9% of homes. \u201cWe had to take out a loan for $12m to come up with the final dollars needed,\u201d Chief Ava Hill said. \u201cIn addition, they have not provided sufficient operation and maintenance dollars for us to run the plant. The challenges of gaining money for infrastructure on reserves is that the federal government simply does not provide enough dollars even though they have the fiduciary responsibility to do so.\u201d With the election of Justin Trudeau, the tide seemed to shift somewhat. The prime minister promised to improve First Nations prosperity and solve the bad water issue on indigenous reserves by March 2021. While there has been some progress, there aren\u2019t sufficient funds. The Liberal government earmarked $1.8bn over five years to solve the water issue. But the real cost is estimated at $3.2bn, leaving the government more than $1bn short. For Thomas, the inequality between indigenous people\u2019s access to drinking water and everyone else didn\u2019t start with water, but far earlier, with land displacement and colonialism. For her, it is the latest example of an ongoing cultural genocide. When thinking about how she will survive another day without drinking water, she remembers how her family has survived in the past. \u201cWe are taught to be resilient,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not right, but it\u2019s just a reality. You have to tell yourself: \u2018This is just the way it is.\u2019 Otherwise you become angry and bitter.\u201d",

Beer has no legitimate medical applications, no matter what we tell ourselves on a Friday evening.\u201d</p> <p>Battley, who spent most of his career at established pharmaceutical firms, said cannabis has been proven to be effective at treating symptoms of a wide range of diseases and conditions, including multiple sclerosis, cancer, HIV/AIDS, epilepsy and arthritis.</p> <p>Aurora, which has expanded from 35 staff when Battley joined in 2016 to 1,500 today, supplies medicinal cannabis to 350,000 Canadians. The value of the company, which has capacity to grow 430 tonnes of cannabis a year and is listed on the Toronto stock exchange, has soared from C$70m (\u00a342m) in 2016 to C$11.8bn (\u00a37.1bn).</p> <p>Values have soared at other cannabis companies, as investors expect huge growth in the market. Shares in rival producer Canopy Growth, which is listed on the Toronto stock exchange under the ticker WEED, have increased sixfold in the past year. Constellation Brands, the owner of Corona beer, bought 35% of Canopy this summer for $4bn. Canopy, the biggest player in the market, is now valued at C$14bn \u2013 making it worth twice as much as Marks &amp; Spencer.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a global mega-trend under way and the leading edge is medical, but it will rocket further when consumer products come online,\u201d Battley said. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s my hope that the UK will become one of the global leaders in Cannabis,\u201d Battley told the British investors. Cannabis is still illegal in the UK, but Battley said he hoped that public outcry over the the case of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jul/05/billy-caldwell-heads-home-amid-doubts-over-cannabis-oil-access-northern-irleand-medication-epilepsy\">Billy Caldwell</a>, a 12-year-old boy with severe epilepsy who was denied access to the cannabis oil he used to manage his condition, would help speed up legislative changes here. Sajid Javid, the home secretary, said in July that doctors would be able to prescribe cannabis-derived medicinal products by the autumn.</p> <p>\u201cWe are in a hopeful moment,\u201d Battley said in reference to the Caldwell case. \u201cThere\u2019s money to be made and a lot of it. This is going to be big, you\u2019ll look back at this as a turning point in your investment.\u201d</p> <p>Battley said the most exciting thing about cannabis as a product is the \u201cremarkable number of routes of delivery\u201d. \u201cHow many ways can you drink a beer?\u201d he asked the assembled crowd of 200 or so investors. \u201cCannabis can be inhaled \u2013 we all experimented with that in college \u2013 it can also be drunk, eaten and applied topically [on the skin],\u201d he said.</p> <p>Battley said cannabis can also deliver a greater range of experiences than beer, because its 483 compounds can be combined in different ways to produce different experiences. \u201cBeer will get you drunk,\u201d he said. \u201cCannabis is a different kind of animal. One combination may deliver a stimulating uplifting effect perfect for a night out with friends, another may make you relaxed and be perfect for a night in at home binge-watching a TV series. Another, may be perfect for a romantic evening with your partner.\u201d</p> <p>Other companies are promising to exploit the latter \u2013 in lubricants which claim to <a href=\"http://velvetswing.com/\">help eight in 10 women achieve </a><a href=\"http://velvetswing.com/\">better orgasms</a>.</p>",

          "bodyText": "In a Mayfair hotel ballroom some of the UK\u2019s biggest banks and pension funds have gathered to consider an investment in a new wonder ingredient that promises to revolutionise products ranging from pharmaceuticals, face creams and diet supplements to yoghurt and beer. That ingredient is cannabis, and it has exploded into a multibillion-dollar industry as countries relax rules on its medical and personal use. It has also become a serious investment proposition. The global cannabis industry has gathered in London this week for Europe\u2019s largest marijuana investment conference, Cannabis Invest, with bosses of industrial-scale weed growers hoping to tap UK investors for fresh funds to drive expansion plans. From 17 October, Canada \u2013 which led the way in legalising prescription cannabis in 2001\u2013 will allow the sale of all recreational marijuana. \u201cIt\u2019s been too easy for our kids to get marijuana \u2013 and for criminals to reap the profits,\u201d Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said on Twitter when the legislation passed. \u201cToday, we change that.\u201d Companies are now preparing to flood the market with a wave of innovative products as well as the more traditional seven-fingered leaves. The bosses of Canada\u2019s cannabis companies \u2013 which have grown from nothing to multibillion-dollar enterprises in less than five years \u2013 claim the industry will soon be bigger than the beer trade. Nav Dhaliwal, chief executive of wholesale company Supreme Cannabis, said: \u201cCannabis is an emerging global market, and our thesis is we are at the beginning of a global rollout. \u201cWe estimate that the market will be worth $180-200bn a year over the next decade just for medical use, and cannabis will expand beyond medical use. From pharmaceutical companies to alcohol to tobacco \u2013 cannabis is a threat to all of these industries.\u201d Research by Prohibition Partners, a cannabis industry research firm, estimates that \u00a38bn changes hands in black market cannabis in the UK alone, but legalised the industry could be worth \u00a316.5bn a year by 2018, meaning UK consumers would be spending four times as much on marijuana as they currently do on bread. \u201cMake no mistake, this is going to become a large global industry \u2013 bigger than global brewing,\u201d Cam Battley, chief corporate officer of Edmonton-based Aurora Cannabis, told investors at the MayFair Hotel conference. \u201cAnd, I\u2019ll tell you why. Beer has no legitimate medical applications, no matter what we tell ourselves on a Friday evening.\u201d Battley, who spent most of his career at established pharmaceutical firms, said cannabis has been proven to be effective at treating symptoms of a wide range of diseases and conditions, including multiple sclerosis, cancer, HIV/AIDS, epilepsy and arthritis. Aurora, which has expanded from 35 staff when Battley joined in 2016 to 1,500 today, supplies medicinal cannabis to 350,000 Canadians. The value of the company, which has capacity to grow 430 tonnes of cannabis a year and is listed on the Toronto stock exchange, has soared from C$70m (\u00a342m) in 2016 to C$11.8bn (\u00a37.1bn). Values have soared at other cannabis companies, as investors expect huge growth in the market. Shares in rival producer Canopy Growth, which is listed on the Toronto stock exchange under the ticker WEED, have increased sixfold in the past year. Constellation Brands, the owner of Corona beer, bought 35% of Canopy this summer for $4bn. Canopy, the biggest player in the market, is now valued at C$14bn \u2013 making it worth twice as much as Marks &amp; Spencer. \u201cThere is a global mega-trend under way and the leading edge is medical, but it will rocket further when consumer products come online,\u201d Battley said. \u201cIt\u2019s my hope that the UK will become one of the global leaders in Cannabis,\u201d Battley told the British investors. Cannabis is still illegal in the UK, but Battley said he hoped that public outcry over the the case of Billy Caldwell, a 12-year-old boy with severe epilepsy who was denied access to the cannabis oil he used to manage his condition, would help speed up legislative changes here. Sajid Javid, the home secretary, said in July that doctors would be able to prescribe cannabis-derived medicinal products by the autumn. \u201cWe are in a hopeful moment,\u201d Battley said in reference to the Caldwell case. \u201cThere\u2019s money to be made and a lot of it. This is going to be big, you\u2019ll look back at this as a turning point in your investment.\u201d Battley said the most exciting thing about cannabis as a product is the \u201cremarkable number of routes of delivery\u201d. \u201cHow many ways can you drink a beer?\u201d he asked the assembled crowd of 200 or so investors. \u201cCannabis can be inhaled \u2013 we all experimented with that in college \u2013 it can also be drunk, eaten and applied topically [on the skin],\u201d he said. Battley said cannabis can also deliver a greater range of experiences than beer, because its 483 compounds can be combined in different ways to produce different experiences. \u201cBeer will get you drunk,\u201d he said. \u201cCannabis is a different kind of animal. One combination may deliver a stimulating uplifting effect perfect for a night out with friends, another may make you relaxed and be perfect for a night in at home binge-watching a TV series. Another, may be perfect for a romantic evening with your partner.\u201d Other companies are promising to exploit the latter \u2013 in lubricants which claim to help eight in 10 women achieve better orgasms.",

          "bodyText": "The global image of the US has sunk to historic lows since Donald Trump took office, a survey of 25 countries has found, with only Israelis, Russians and Kenyans showing an increase in positive attitudes. In the Pew Research Center poll, respondents generally had less confidence in Trump\u2019s ability to lead than they did in Vladimir Putin\u2019s and Xi Jinping\u2019s. A year after confidence in the US collapsed during the real estate tycoon\u2019s first year in power, favourable views of the country remained low in 2018, especially among the US\u2019s closest allies. In Canada, whose prime minister, Justin Trudeau, Trump has called \u201cdishonest and weak\u201d, only 39% of respondents had a positive view of the US, down from 65% at the end of the Obama presidency. For Mexico, a neighbour Trump wants to isolate with his plans to build a wall, this figure halved from 66% to 32%. The UK was split on its opinion of the US under Trump, with 50% having favourable views, although that was down 11 points since Obama left office. Among the countries that bucked the trend, the most significant increase was in Russia, up 11 points, yet it had by far the lowest score under Obama \u2013 only 15% of respondents looked on the US favourably at the end of his tenure. Positive views in Kenya have jumped seven points to 70%, and in Israel, where Trump has implemented policies seen as favourable to the country, including declaring Jerusalem as its capital to the outrage of Palestinians, they stood at 82%, up two points. Despite the plunge, on balance, a median of 50% of respondents across the nations surveyed had a favourable opinion of the US, compared with 43% whose views were negative. However, Trump\u2019s personal image remained very low, with a median of only 27% saying they have confidence in him to do the right thing in world affairs.

In South Korea, however, faith in Trump surged by 27 points, possibly buoyed by peacemaking efforts with North Korea, although the rise only brought Trump\u2019s rating up to 44%. At the UN general assembly in New York last week, Trump\u2019s speech to world leaders was met with laughter when he claimed to have achieved more in his two years in the White House than almost any US president.

Chapter 19 allows Canada, Mexico and the United States to challenge one another\u2019s anti-dumping and countervailing duties in front of a panel of representatives from each country. This is generally a much easier process than trying to challenge a trade practice in a U.S. court</p> <p><strong>On cars, Mexico and Canada get assurance that Trump won\u2019t pound them with auto tariffs</strong>. The US administration signed \u201cside letters\u201d allowing Canada and Mexico can continue sending about the same number of vehicles and parts across the border free of charge, regardless of whether auto tariffs go into effect down the road.

          "bodyText": "And finally, you can get up to speed with today\u2019s trade news with this one-minute video. That\u2019s probably all for today (although I might pop back later for the close of Wall Street...) America\u2019s chemicals industry doesn\u2019t agree that Nafta was a disastrous trade deal. According to the American Chemistry Council, around 46,000 chemicals jobs depend on trade with Mexico and Canada, due to the free trade links created over the last few decades. Chemical exports to the two countries have more than tripled, from $13 billion in 1994, to $44 billion in 2018. The ACC explains: \u201cThe U.S. chemical sector has capitalized on duty-free trade under NAFTA ever since its inception, more than tripling U.S. chemicals exports to Canada and Mexico \u2013 from $13 billion in 1994, to $44 billion in 2018. Approximately 46,000 U.S. chemical jobs now depend on trade with Canada and Mexico. And due to the chemical industry\u2019s early position in the supply chain, U.S. chemical manufacturers have exploited the cost savings from duty-free trade with Mexico and Canada in order to power growth throughout the supply chain and lower prices for manufacturers and consumers.\u201d The ACC is now studying USMCA, but has already commended the negotiators for updating Nafta (despite Trump claiming Nafta is toast). Back in the markets, the Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso are holding onto their earlier gains against the US dollar. Shares are still up on Wall Street too, as investors welcome the USMCA deal. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, says: The dollar weakened against the Canadian dollar which was boosted by Canada\u2019s freshly minted trade deal with the US. The deal with the slightly less elegant name of United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, will replace the existing NAFTA and will give the US access to the Canadian dairy market while capping Canada\u2019s car exports to its southern neighbour. Taken as a sign that the US will be open to finding resolutions to its other ongoing trade disputes the deal prompted rallies across the US markets and caused the DJIA to climb 250 points. Donald Trump used some big numbers to describe America\u2019s trade imbalances.... but Daniel Dale of the Toronto Star reckons they were rather too big:  Trump\u2019s big press conference has descended into rancour, as reporters continue to ask about the Kavanaugh situation. The president does say the FBI should hold a \u201cvery comprehensive investigation\u201d into the allegations brought against his supreme court nominee, and interview anyone they want \u201cwithin reason\u201d. So far so sensible... Unlike the moment when he jibes that one female reporter never thinks (WHAT?!).... and then accuses the entire press pack of being terribly unfair to him, and going \u201cloco\u201d. Trump is now taking questions....although he\u2019s refusing to take any on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. On the negotiations, he says there were tensions with Canada\u2019s PM, but the two sides got there eventually. Q: Will tariffs on Canadian and Mexican steel and aluminium be lifted? No, says Trump... not unless something can be agreed on quotas to prevent too much metal coming into the US. That\u2019s a blow for Canada\u2019s steel industry, who must have hoped that USMCA would bring them some relief. Worryingly for Brussels, Trump suggests he could soon impose tariffs on EU car imports (which would go down very badly with the US and French auto industry). He also says he doesn\u2019t want China to have a hard time on trade. Here\u2019s a clip of Donald Trump announcing the new trade deal: Donald Trump ends his victory lap by pointing to America\u2019s strong labour market, and the 50% stock market rally since his election. In a warning to Beijing, Trump says it\u2019s \u201ctoo early\u201d to hold talks with China to resolve the ongoing trade dispute. He claims that China wants to talk \u201cvery badly\u201d....however, China did actually warn that it wouldn\u2019t negotiate unless Trump dropped his threats. Getting into his stride, Trump now hits at the \u201cbabies\u201d who claim that tariffs don\u2019t make a difference. We wouldn\u2019t be standing here without tariffs, he argues. He adds that other countries such as India have been on the phone to the White House trying to renegotiate trade deals, because they\u2019re scared that the US will hit them with tariffs. Once USMCA is approved, it will be a new dawn for the US auto industry and the US auto worker, continues Trump. It will make North America a \u201cmanufacturing powerhouse\u201d, he promises. But he also points out that the deal hasn\u2019t been approved by Congress, suggesting that some on Capitol Hill might oppose the deal \u201cjust because Trump likes it\u201d. No Trump speech is complete, it seems, without an attack on some of America\u2019s trading partners. And today, he turns his guns on Europe, saying it\u2019s a privilege for them to sell goods to America. Ditto Japan, Trump continues.. saying it\u2019s a privilege for them to \u201cattack the US piggy bank\u201d. Onto the details... Trump says USMCA is the most modern, up-to-date and balanced trade agreement ever, with the \u201cmost advanced protections ever for workers\u201d. It will help US farmers and ranchers export wheat, poultry, eggs and dairy products to Mexico and Canada. The president also singles out the provision that higher-paid workers produce a proportion of cars n the region, and the new protection for intellectual property. Trump then thanks a string of top officials for their work on USMCA, singling out US trade representative Robert Lighthizer for special praise. Whenever you called Lighthizer, you\u2019d find him working in his office or another office, says Trump, hailing his work ethic. He also says Mexico\u2019s outgoing president Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto should get credit, calling him a \u201cterrific person\u201d. Justin Trudeau got a great deal for Canada, Trump adds graciously. Donald Trump begins by saying it\u2019s a beautiful, beautiful day in Washington.... and a day in which he brings \u201ctruly historic news for our nation, and the world.\u201d We have successfully completed negotiations on a brand new deal to terminate and and replace Nafta with an incredible new deal with Canada and Mexico, called USMCA, Trump says proudly. USMCA has a good ring to it, he muses. The president then lays into Nafta, calling it the \u201cworst trade deal ever made\u201d, which cost America one in four auto jobs. USMCA, Trump continues, is the biggest trade deal in US history.... Donald Trump has arrived at the podium at the White House Rose Garden to speak about the USMCA trade deal, and presumably take a victory lap.... There\u2019s a good round-up of the key differences between Nafta and USMCA here in the Washington Post, by Heather Long. Here\u2019s a quick summary: New name. Goodbye NAFTA. The new deal will be known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA Big changes for cars. More cars and truck parts should be made in North America. WashPo says: Starting in 2020, to qualify for zero tariffs, a car or truck must have 75 percent of its components manufactured in Canada, Mexico or the United States, a substantial boost from the current 62.5 percent requirement. There\u2019s also a new rule that a significant percentage of the work done on the car must be completed by workers earning at least $16 an hour, or about three times what the typical Mexican autoworker makes. Trump\u2019s victory: Canada opens up its milk market by giving a larger share to U.S. farmers and eliminating its Class 7 pricing scheme. That means U.S. dairy farmers can probably send a lot more milk protein concentrate, skim milk powder and infant formula to Canada (and those products are relatively easy to transport and store). Canada\u2019s victory: Chapter 19, allowing for a special dispute process, stays intact. Chapter 19 allows Canada, Mexico and the United States to challenge one another\u2019s anti-dumping and countervailing duties in front of a panel of representatives from each country. This is generally a much easier process than trying to challenge a trade practice in a U.S. court On cars, Mexico and Canada get assurance that Trump won\u2019t pound them with auto tariffs. The US administration signed \u201cside letters\u201d allowing Canada and Mexico can continue sending about the same number of vehicles and parts across the border free of charge, regardless of whether auto tariffs go into effect down the road. Only parts above that quota could face tariffs. Trump\u2019s steel tariffs stay in place (for now). Canada wanted Trump to stop his 25 percent tariffs on Canadian steel, but there\u2019s no deal (yet) Improved labor and environmental rights, particularly for Mexico.... For example, the USMCA stipulates that Mexican trucks that cross the border into the United States must meet higher safety regulations and that Mexican workers must have more ability to organize and form unions. Increased intellectual property protections. There are more-stringent protections for patents and trademarks, including for biotech, financial services and domain names - which weren\u2019t considered when Nafta was created in the 1990s. Chapter 11, giving investors a special way to fight government decisions, is (mostly) gone. That will please critics, who say it allowed investors to sue governments and win money off the taxpayer. Duncan Weldon of Britain\u2019s Resolution Group also sees a theme developing.... The New York stock market has opened higher, as Wall Street traders give USMCA the thumbs-up. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 150 points as the opening bell rang out. The broader S&amp;P 500 index is also rattling higher... If USMCA isn\u2019t as \u2018historic\u2019 a change as president Trump claims, why has it been well-received in the markets? Well, economists will be relieved that the agreement maintains zero tariffs on swathes of goods between the three countries. That removes the risk of hefty new levies that would curb demand. But also, a pattern is emerging; the Trump White House demands major changes, gets some progress, declares a famous victory, and moves onto the next battle. A similar result with, say, the Chinese trade talks would be welcomed by investors..... Donald Trump is expected to speak about the USMCA deal at the White House at around 11am local time (4pm BST). The Financial Times have helpfully flagged up some of the differences between USMCA and Nafta. They\u2019re not dramatic, but together they represent an evolution from the previous trade deal created in the Clinton era. For example, new \u201crules of origin\u201d will force carmakers to use more parts from the region. A new wages condition states that a minimum input must be added in factories that pay workers at least $16 an hour. That could move some work from Mexico back to America. There\u2019s also now a sunset clause \u2013 stating that USMCA will expire in 16 years (Nafta ran indefinitely). The FT explains: The Trump administration had long demanded such a \u201csunset\u201d clause. Indeed, Washington had wanted the sunset clause period to last only five years, but was rebuffed by Canada and Mexico. Plus (as explained earlier), we have the new access to Canada\u2019s dairy industry (a win for America), and the retention of the Chapter 19 resolution facility (a win for Canada). More here. Cailin Birch, senior commodities analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, also argues that USMCA isn\u2019t all that different from Nafta: She says: \u201cAlthough the details remain unclear, the broad agreement reached by the US and Canada on 30 September 30 fits with our forecast \u2013 namely, that a trilateral trade agreement would be agreed with a few changes around the margin, but that the structure of the agreement would not be fundamentally altered. It is in all three countries\u2019 interest that a trilateral agreement was reached - Canada and Mexico are critical export markets for US producers, and regional supply chains have become deeply intertwined since Nafta was first introduced in 1994. As a result, US businesses would have been heavily negatively affected by the dissolution of Nafta. Likewise, both Canada and Mexico will have greater bargaining power as part of a North America-wide agreement than they would have had in separate bilateral deals with the US. The recent jump in both the Mexican peso and the Canadian dollar confirms that market fears are beginning to ease, as clarity improves over the future of North American trade policy. However, the difficulty of the negotiations, and particularly the \u201cdivide and conquer\u201d strategy employed by the Trump administration, is likely to weigh on North American diplomatic and political relations for the remainder of this administration.\u201d America\u2019s tech sector hasn\u2019t approved of Trump\u2019s belligerence on trade matters in the past - particularly the tariffs imposed on China. But today, the Information Technology Industry Council is all smiles. ITI president and CEO Dean Garfield says USMCA is a welcome move \u2013 adding that it will build on Nafta, not just confine it to history. Garfield says: \u201cToday\u2019s trilateral agreement is a significant step toward creating a foundation for North America\u2019s economic prosperity for years to come. While we are still reviewing text, we\u2019re encouraged this plan will build upon the prior economic success of Nafta and adapt it to the fundamentally digital economy in which we live through new rules on digital trade, intellectual property, and trade in goods. We understand and appreciate that negotiators have taken their time to secure strong provisions in this agreement that will greatly advance digital trade in North America, enabling companies across industries to hire more workers, innovate more products and grow the economies in their communities.\u201d Political scientist Ian Bremmer argues that the USMCA deal is a genuine breakthrough, which could help president Trump force Beijing into a new trade deal too: European stock market have all rallied today, on relief that the Nafta trade deal is being updated, not abandoned. Shares have risen in London, Frankfurt, Paris and beyond...paving the way for a rally on Wall Street in a few hours. David Madden of City trading firm CMC Markets says: European equity markets have been boosted by the news that the US and Canada have struck a trade deal. The agreement between US and Canadian trade delegates was struck just hours before the midnight deadline, and President Trump will be delighted that he managed to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement. The Mexican component of the deal was reached in August and now that the Canadian element has fallen into place, bullish sentiment is sweeping across global markets. Warm words from the White House.... The head of the OECD thinktank, Angel Gurr\u00eda, has also welcomed the \u201cnew, modernised\u201d trade deal between the US, Mexico and Canada. Secretary-general Gurr\u00eda says: \u201cThe OECD has long supported open markets for trade and investment as a crucial driver of economic growth and jobs. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement supports strong growth and good jobs in all three countries; it will boost the confidence of firms and investors by preserving stable and predictable rules-based trade in North America. It will make the region more productive and more competitive internationally.\u201d Just in: Donald Trump has tweeted that the new trade agreement with Canada is a \u201cwonderful\u201d and \u201chistoric\u201d breakthrough. He argues that it will help US farmers and manufacturers sell goods overseas (a reference to Canada opening up its dairy sector to more competition). He adds that USMCA will help the US, Canada and Mexico compete with the rest of the world -- a reminder that Washington is still pushing Beijing to reform its trade practices too. The US government has now released the details of the revamped trade deal, online here. It begins by boldly declaring that America, Canada and Mexico have agreed to \u201cstrengthen anew\u201d their \u201clongstanding friendship\u201d -- not that relations have been particularly chummy since Donald Trump became president. The agreement then confirms that the three parties have agreed to \u201cREPLACE\u201d (their capitals) the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement with..... \u201c...a 21st Century, high standard new agreement to support mutually beneficial trade leading to freer, fairer markets, and to robust economic growth in the region\u201d. That will allow Trump to declare that he has delivered on his pledge to reshape Nafta (presumably he\u2019ll be awake and tweeting shortly...). But what of the new free trade deal itself? Wins for America include: US farmers get greater access to Canada\u2019s dairy market, through an increased quota on foreign imports. This may be slightly more generous than the quotas available to Asian countries under the Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) deal. Canada has agreed to eliminate two classes of milk, which had encouraged Canadians to buy domestic milk rather than from overseas. That should help US producers who want to sell more milk across the border (which explains why the Canadian dairy lobby aren\u2019t happy) Canada, meanwhile, will be pleased that: The \u201cChapter 19 dispute-settlement mechanism\u201d, created to resolve trade and anti-dumping disputes, remains untouched in the new agreement. Washington doesn\u2019t like these dispute panels, and had pushed for Chapter 19 to be abolished. On cars, the deal means there is no hard limit on Canadian auto exports to America. Canada has also been promised an exemption if Trump imposes new tariffs on this area. Getting back to the US-Canada-Mexico trade deal....and Bloomberg\u2019s Joe Nocera has written a interesting article explaining why America need to agree a new trade deal with Canada. He points out that Canada is a massive trade partner for many US states, thanks to the elimination of tariffs under Nafta. For example, Virginia exports $3bn of goods to Canada -- around one-fifth of the state\u2019s total exports -- while importing $2bn. So, even though Donald Trump has savaged the Nafta deal in the past, Washington couldn\u2019t afford let it die without a replacement. Nocera explains: The media has been quick to label the deal with Canada \u2013 called the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA \u2013 a \u201cwin\u201d for Trump, but the truth is that for all his bluster, Nafta hasn\u2019t been \u201crenegotiated\u201d so much as it\u2019s been fiddled with on the margins. The new Nafta \u2013 which Trump will no doubt praise \u2013 will be more or less the same as the old Nafta, which he has called \u201cthe worst trade deal in history.\u201d Virginia will no doubt breathe a sigh of relief, as will businesses and labor unions and states across the country. They all understand that trade creates more jobs that it destroys, which is exactly what the Virginia example shows. Lee McDarby, Corporate IP Managing Director at moneycorp, suspects the weak pount helped UK factories to grow faster last month: \u201cUK manufacturing shifted up a gear in September, with significant growth showing a clear pace of expansion. This increase is likely to be down to the Pound\u2019s weakness and the Eurozone\u2019s slowdown of manufacturing activity, with British manufacturers increasing outputs to take advantage of the opportunities to sell products overseas. Dave Atkinson, UK head of manufacturing at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, points out that economic uncertainty is still high: \u201cAn increase in the PMI figure this month is welcome news for a sector grappling with an ongoing lack of clarity about the UK\u2019s future trading relationship with the EU, escalating trade wars and rising commodity prices. \u201cManufacturers across different sub-sectors are starting to react to the ever-increasing likelihood of a no-deal Brexit with a degree of nervousness. Announcements from major automotive firms in response to ongoing economic uncertainty and suppressed demand are signs it is creating unease. Capital Economics remain cautious: Newsflash: Britain\u2019s factories have shaken off worries over trade wars and Brexit. Activity in the UK manufacturing sector picked up in September, according to the latest data from Markit. Output and new orders grew at a fast rate, while new export business returned to (modest) growth after a worrying decline in August. This pushed Markit\u2019s UK manufacturing PMI up to 53.8 in September, better than expected (and faster than the eurozone too!). August\u2019s report has been revised up too, to 53.0. Rob Dobson, Director at IHS Markit, says we shouldn\u2019t get carried away -- growth is still unspectacular, and firms did cut their headcount last month. Dobson adds: \u201cSeptember saw a mild improvement in the performance of the UK manufacturing sector. Domestic market demand strengthened, while increased orders from North America and Europe helped new export business stage a modest recovery from August\u2019s contraction. Business confidence also rose to a three- month high. \u201cDespite these causes for short-term optimism, conditions in manufacturing are still relatively lacklustre overall. Based on its historical relationship with official ONS data, the latest survey is consistent with output expanding at only a moderate pace. Although total exports rose, exports of goods used as inputs by other manufacturers fell for the third straight month, ending the worst quarter for over three years for such exporters, suggesting that foreign companies may be sourcing less from UK-based component suppliers. Eurozone factories aren\u2019t the only ones to find September tough. Over in China, manufacturing growth ground to a halt last month, according to the latest healthcheck from Markit. Chinese factory bosses reported that new export business had fallen at the quickest rate since early 2016, spurring them on to cut staffing levels. This pulled the Chinese manufacturing PMI down to 50.0, a level that shows stagnation. This will fuel concerns that Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with China is causing economic harm. Dr. Zhengsheng Zhong, Director of Macroeconomic Analysis at CEBM Group, says Chinese factories are suffering from weaker demand, adding gloomily that.... Expansion across the manufacturing sector weakened in September, as exports increasingly dragged down performance and continued softening demand began to have an impact on companies\u2019 production. In addition, the employment situation worsened further. Downward pressure on China\u2019s economy was significant.\u201d Newsflash: Growth across the eurozone\u2019s factory sector has dropped to its lowest level in two years. Data firm IHS Markit says its eurozone manufacturing PMI, which measures activity across the industry, fell to 53.2 in September, down from 54.6 in August. That pulls it closer to the 50-point mark showing stagnation. Firms reported that export growth was modest last month, with several major EU nations faring particularly badly. Markis blames the \u201cweakening trade cycle\u201d for denting demand for European goods, adding: Eurozone new export orders were little-changed during September, rising only slightly and at the weakest rate in the current 63-month sequence of growth. Whilst the Netherlands, Ireland and Greece all continued to record notable increases in exports, outright falls were seen in France and Germany. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, adds that eurozone manufacturing \u2018shifted down yet another gear\u2019 in recent months: \u201cThe survey paints the worst trade picture for over five years, with export growth having slumped sharply from a series record high in late 2017 to near-stagnation in September. \u201cThe slowdown can be linked to sluggish demand and increased risk aversion among customers, often linked to worries about trade wars and tariffs, but also ascribed to rising political uncertainty and higher prices. Canada\u2019s farmers don\u2019t believe Justin Trudeau\u2019s claim that the USMCA deal is \u201cgood for Canada\u201d. They\u2019re deeply unhappy that American farmers will get more access to Canadian consumers, and fear it will cost jobs. Pierre Lampron, president of Dairy Farmers of Canada, says: Granting an additional market access of 3.59% to our domestic dairy market, eliminating competitive dairy classes and extraordinary measures to limit our ability to export dairy products will have a dramatic impact not only for dairy farmers but for the whole sector. This has happened, despite assurances that our government would not sign a bad deal for Canadians. We fail to see how this deal can be good for the 220,000 Canadian families that depend on dairy for their livelihood. Donald Trump may be delighted, though. He\u2019s long criticised Canada\u2019s swathe of protections for its dairy industry, which guarantee prices for producers and restrict milk imports from overseas. We don\u2019t yet know exactly what USMCA will entail (US officials have only said it includes \u201ca host of provisions\u201d to \u201crebalance\u201d trade). Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit fears it won\u2019t be an improvement on NAFTA (which cut a swath of trade barriers between its members). Adam Cole of Royal Bank of Canada concurs, saying: Details of the deal are still incomplete, though it appears Canada has conceded greater access to dairy markets and tighter rules of origin for cars. In return, the US has granted Canada limited guaranteed exception in the event of broader tariffs on car imports and the Chapter 19 dispute resolution mechanism remains unchanged. But Yukio Ishizuki, senior currency strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo, reckons the deal should boost optimism: \u201cThough markets were already anticipating an agreement, one source of worry will be swept away if a deal is made,\u201d \u201cThat will lead to a rise in trust in the U.S. economy, so it\u2019s easy for risk sentiment to improve.\u201d The Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso are both rallying, on the back of the USMCA deal. The Canadian dollar, or \u2018loonie\u2019, has jumped to a four-month high, touching C$1.2887 per dollar for the first time since May. The peso gained 0.5% cent to over 18.63 pesos per dollar, its highest since August, as trade war fears ebbed away. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says: The trilateral agreement brings an end to months of uncertainty surrounding North American trade. The resultant risk on sentiment has seen equity futures rally strongly overnight. The S&amp;P futures are back towards record territory, whilst the safe haven yen tumbled to a fresh year to date low versus the dollar. Boom! Japan\u2019s benchmark stock index, the Nikkei, has hit its highest level since 1991. The Nikkei gained 0.5% today, closing at 24,245 -- its best level in 27 years. Markets across Asia were boosted by reports that the US and Canada had agreed a new trade deal. Shares also got a lift from the recent weakness of the yen. It hit a one-year low against the US dollar today, which should help exporters and lift profits. However, the Nikkei is still a long way below its previous all-time high, at the end of the boom in 1989. Canadian PM Justin Trudeau told reporters that \u201cIt\u2019s a good day for Canada,\u201d after his cabinet backed the new USMCA deal -- even though his nation\u2019s farmers will now face more competition from US rivals. Jes\u00fas Seade, top Nafta negotiator for Mexico\u2019s President-elect Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, has tweeted that USMCA will provide \u201ccertainty and stability to trade in Mexico\u201d. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The world has taken a step back from a damaging global trade war, after Canada and the United States reached a deal on reforming the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). After a nail-biting weekend of talks, negotiators from both countries managed to hammer out a new deal, dubbed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. USMCA doesn\u2019t trip off the tongue like Nafta, but that didn\u2019t stop Justin Trudeau\u2019s cabinet signing the deal off shortly before midnight in Washington, to avoid trade relations with the US being poisoned. Robert Lighthizer, US trade representative, and Chrystia Freeland, Canada\u2019s foreign minister, both declared victory. In a joint statement, they said: \u201cUSMCA will give our workers, farmers, ranchers and businesses a high-standard trade agreement that will result in freer markets, fairer trade and robust economic growth in our region. It will strengthen the middle class, and create good, well-paying jobs and new opportunities for the nearly half billion people who call North America home.\u201d Canada has made some concessions, including removing help for its dairy farmers, in return for protections for its car industry. Reuters explains: The deal will preserve a trade dispute settlement mechanism that Canada fought hard to maintain to protect its lumber industry and other sectors from US anti-dumping tariffs, Canadian sources said. But this came at a cost. Canada had agreed to provide US dairy farmers access to about 3.5% of its approximately $16bn annual domestic dairy market, the sources said, adding that the Canadian government was prepared to offer compensation to dairy farmers hurt by the deal. The influential Dairy Farmers of Canada lobby group \u2013 which strongly opposes the idea \u2013 said in a statement that it insisted \u201cany final Nafta deal should have no further negative impact on the dairy sector\u201d. Canada also agreed to a quota of 2.6m vehicles exported to the US in the event that Trump imposed 25% global autos tariffs on national security grounds, a side letter to the agreement showed. The quota would allow for significant growth in tariff-free automotive exports from Canada above current production levels of about 2 million units, safeguarding Canadian plants. The breakthrough should be welcomed in the markets, where worries over trade wars have weighed on sentiment for months. Also coming up today New manufacturing data will show how UK and Eurozone factories fared in September. Britain\u2019s factory growth is expected to have slowed a little (the City expects the manufacturing PMI to drop to 52.5 from 52.8), while eurozone growth could be unchanged at 53.5.

          "bodyText": "A Canadian member of parliament has said that Justin Trudeau \u201cdoesn\u2019t give a fuck\u201d about the rights of indigenous people, amid mounting tensions between the country\u2019s First Nations and at the federal government. Romeo Saganash, a Cree lawmaker, made the comments in parliament during a discussion of the the Trans Mountain pipeline project that was recently halted after the federal court of appeals ruled that the government had failed to adequately address the concerns of some First Nations. The Liberal government insists that the pipeline will go ahead. \u201cWhen the prime minister says that this pipeline expansion will be done no matter what, and his minister adds that Canada will not be able to accommodate all indigenous concerns, what that means is that they have decided to willfully violate their constitutional duties and obligations,\u201d said Saganash. \u201cMr Speaker, sounds like a most important relationship, doesn\u2019t it? Why doesn\u2019t the prime minister just say the truth and tell indigenous peoples that he doesn\u2019t give a fuck about their rights?\u201d Saganash was quickly admonished by the speaker of the House, Geoff Regan, for the use of the language and was given the opportunity to withdraw his comment. \u201cMr Speaker, what is happening is so insulting, it makes me so angry, but I do withdraw the word,\u201d Saganash said. His outburst resonated on social media, with several prominent indigenous voices expressing support. \u201cI\u2019m team F-bomb, I heard not a single lie,\u201d tweeted academic Chelsea Vowel. \u201cColonial respectability politics in canada is: a history of violently disciplining Indigenous folks into \u2018polite\u2019, \u2018civil\u2019 subjects of a state actively dispossessing us &amp; destroying our homelands. Fuck that,\u201d said writer Erica Violet Lee on Twitter. \u201cA clear sign that our collective frustration with a real lack of progress on our life and death issues is mounting. We need action, not tired platitudes about reconciliation,\u201d wrote professor Pam Palmater. Others argued that the use of profanity was insignificant when set against the numerous challenges facing indigenous communities across the country. \u201cAnd if the F-word offends you, wait until you hear about the state of potable water on First Nations communities across the country,\u201d wrote one user, in a reference to the more than 50 indigenous communities that are required to boil their water due to health and safety concerns. In February, Trudeau announced an overhaul of the federal government\u2019s relationship with indigenous peoples. \u201cWe have listened and learned and we will work together to take concrete action to build a better future and a new relationship,\u201d he said. But in its August ruling on the Trans Mountain pipeline, the appeals court admonished the government for an inadequate consultation with First Nations. Saganash, a parliamentarian representing northern Quebec for the progressive New Democratic party, was forcibly taken from his home at age seven to attend a residential school \u2013 part of a policy later described by the country\u2019s Truth and Reconciliation Commission as \u201ccultural genocide\u201d. \u201cI can never be normal,\u201d Saganash testified before the commission. \u2018\u2018And none, none of those kids who were sent to residential schools can claim to be normal today. It\u2019s impossible.\u201d He is the first Cree to receive a law degree from Quebec and is the first indigenous person to run for leadership of a federal party. Trudeau, who was not present during the session in the House, is no stranger to the use of \u201cunparliamentary\u201d language. Last week, he apologized for saying \u201cdamn\u201d during question period. In 2011, prior to leading the Liberal party, he apologized to the environment minister, Peter Kent, after an outburst in which he called Kent a \u201cpiece of shit\u201d.",

Our neighbor to the north, Canada, has a population slightly more than one-tenth that of the United States \u2013 and an economy slightly less than one-tenth the size.

Canada is now taking in 27,000 refugees a year.

Impoverished Bangladesh is sheltering about 700,000 Rohingya who have fled genocidal violence in Myanmar during the past year.

He failed to mention, however, that the great majority of these would be denied.

That number is likely to go down.</p> <p>Many asylum applicants are migrants from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. These are countries with extremely high murder rates due to gang violence that is, in part, a legacy of the wars in Central America of a generation ago. The Trump administration has made it clear to immigration judges \u2013 who are administrative employees of the United States Department of Justice \u2013 that it does not believe that escaping the gangs amounts to fleeing \u201ca well-founded fear of persecution,\u201d the legal standard for granting asylum.</p> <p>The claim that the United States is very generous also seems based on the amount of foreign aid that is distributed. Though this is larger in absolute terms than the aid given by others, as a percentage of GDP, it is much lower than that of several other western countries.</p> <p>Since 1975, the United States has accepted more than 3.3 million refugees for permanent resettlement, or close to 80,000 a year on average. The Trump administration reduced the ceiling to 45,000 for the current year. Though the final numbers are not yet in hand, the United States is on track for about half that. That suggests that next year\u2019s refugee admissions could also be a lot lower than the 30,000 that has been announced. This appears a victory for administration hard line ethnic nationalists who sought a far lower figure.</p> <p>According to the International Rescue Committee, those admitted in the current year which ends 30 September include only 60 Syrian refugees. Though the Trump administration has said it gives priority to persecuted religious minorities, only five Yazidis were admitted. Another category that is supposedly favored includes Iraqis who gave assistance to US missions in that country and who may subsequently be in danger. Only 48 of them were admitted this year.</p> <p>Like its predecessors, the Trump administration is concerned about the global reputation of the United States.

Given his definitive answer in the House of Representatives, it is the view of the committee the minister misled Parliament in relation to this matter.<br></li> <li> It is the view of the committee that Minister Dutton acted expeditiously in using his ministerial intervention powers to grant a tourist visa to the au pair in the Adelaide case. Whilst the use of these powers is within his rights as the relevant minister, the committee recognises this request for intervention may not have come to the attention of Minister Dutton prior to the individual\u2019s removal from Australia if it was not for the fact it was raised through personal connections. Minister Dutton appears to have failed to give consideration to the damage to public confidence in the integrity of the immigration system that his actions could cause and, at best, reflects very poor judgement on the part of the minister.<br></li> <li> In the Adelaide case, Minister Dutton signed the intervention documents despite acting ministerial arrangements being in place. No evidence presented assured the committee that there were any reasons why Minister Dutton signed the ministerial intervention in the Adelaide case rather than acting Minister Keenan, heightening perceptions that Minister Dutton acted due to a personal interest.<br></li> <li> It is the view of the committee that substantial inconsistencies in evidence provided by the department during the course of the inquiry leaves significant doubt as to whether all relevant ministerial interventions have been captured by the inquiry.<br></li> <li>Given the broad powers of the immigration minister, any perception of conflict of interest or corruption in relation to the use of ministerial intervention powers is detrimental to the integrity of Australia\u2019s immigration system. While these powers are intended to ensure legitimate cases of humanitarian need or public interest can be addressed, Minister Dutton\u2019s interventions in these au pair cases do not reflect community expectations of how such powers should be used.<br></li> <li>At best, Minister Dutton\u2019s actions have resulted in a perception, if not an actual, conflict of interest. To ensure transparent and accountable decisions, the government should give serious consideration to strengthening the minister\u2019s statement to parliament, requiring the minister\u2019s statement to declare that the ministerial intervention was made in accordance with the ministerial guidelines, thereby maintaining community confidence in the integrity of Australia\u2019s immigration system.<br></li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-09-19T07:48:30.718Z\">at 8.48am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ba1fd89e4b0f675819f4139\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-09-19T07:41:15.482Z\">8.41am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>You can find the whole report \u2013 including the Coalition senator\u2019s dissenting report \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Legal_and_Constitutional_Affairs/AuPairs/Report/c02\">here</a>.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-09-19T07:41:59.597Z\">at 8.41am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ba1fcfae4b0f675819f412c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-09-19T07:39:33.136Z\">8.39am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Louise Pratt</strong>: \u201cI can\u2019t think of all the extraordinary humanitarian cases which require intervention, but this is an extraordinary level of service provided by the minister\u2019s office which underscores the minister\u2019s [personal involvement]\u201d.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-09-19T07:41:20.658Z\">at 8.41am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ba1fbb8e4b0f675819f411f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-09-19T07:35:20.676Z\">8.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Peter Dutton 'misled' parliament \u2013 committee finds</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>\u201cThere is no basis for the minister to say he had no personal connection, when the very genesis of the request came through his office because of a personal connection,\u201d <strong>Louise Pratt </strong>says.</p> <p>She said the committee has found (I would imagine there is a dissenting report) that it has undermined the integrity of the immigration department. </p> <p>Given how strong Pratt\u2019s language is here, I think we will be seeing a no confidence motion coming the parliament\u2019s way.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-09-19T07:40:36.926Z\">at 8.40am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ba1fb89e4b0f675819f411e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-09-19T07:32:51.487Z\">8.32am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>\u201cIt is the view of the committee that the minister misled the parliament in this matter,\u201d <strong>Louise Pratt</strong> says, in handing down the report.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ba1fb5be4b0f675819f411d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-09-19T07:31:57.469Z\">8.31am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Senate is receiving the <strong>Peter Dutton</strong> report as I type this.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ba1f563e4b0b5565ec2fdc3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-09-19T07:06:55.569Z\">8.06am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Greens have released this statement:</p> <p>The Senate has today ordered the government to table the Ruddock review by 9.30am Thursday, after a passing a motion from the Australian Greens.</p> <p>Greens LGBTIQ+ spokesperson <strong>Janet Rice</strong> said: \u201cLGBTIQ+ communities have been left in the lurch for months awaiting the release of this report.

The government has made no decision to cut penalty rates, as she well knows. </p> <p>When the leader of the opposition was the minister responsible, he was involved in setting up the Fair Work Commission. </p> <p>The Fair Work Commission and all of the architecture around it can be laid at the feet of the leader of the opposition.

And it deserves to be called out in this house. But as she should know, it is the people who are sitting on their side of the chamber who have been working hard to ensure the financial security of Australian women. </p> <p>We have been doing that because we have wanted to increase the job opportunities for Australian women. And under our government, there are more women in work than ever before. It is very hard ... It is very hard to be on the path to financial security if you do not have a job. </p> <p>And it is this side of the house that has been working incredibly hard to put in place important superannuation reforms that would provide flexibility so that women who want to actually catch up on their superannuation contributions can do so under our measures, measures that would be scrapped by those opposite. </p> <p>We have levelled the playing field. We have levelled the playing field to make sure that anyone regardless of their circumstances can make a personal deduction and have the same concessions with their superannuation, which costs us more than $1bn to do that. </p> <p>But the thing that they could really do to actually help the security of Australian women would be to support the government\u2019s protecting your super legislation. </p> <p>That legislation would protect Australian workers, protect hard-working Australian people from the rorts and rip-offs in the superannuation sector but they are going to stand with high, fee paying funds, high-speed charging funds and they will stand with the big insurers, not the Australian people.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-09-19T04:42:32.051Z\">at 5.42am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ba1cc70e4b0b5565ec2fce4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-09-19T04:15:13.977Z\">5.15am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Roman Quaedvlieg</strong> has written to the au pair Senate inquiry \u2013 and he is not backing down (it looks like it was sent on 16 September) and has now been tabled: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/quaedvliegs/status/1042264288096706561\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">My letter to the au pair committee about the PM, Dutton, and a slew of other government entities, discrediting a witness attempting to engage in a parliamentary process and who had not yet completed his evidence.

And that change is also necessary to make parliament a more attractive and better career option for Australian women.</p> <p>For over a quarter of a century now our party has been committed to this goal of making our party better represent the Australian people and reflecting the principle of equality by ensuring more women were elected to federal, state and territory parliaments.</p> <p>Labor supports affirmative action not just because we think women have just as much right as men to serve in this place and others, but also because we think this parliament is a better place when it more closely reflects the people we represent.</p> <p>And we support affirmative action because it is the best way to tackle and defeat the systemic failures in our political system.</p> <p>It also changes culture and it changes policy. Recall it was a Labor government that put in place measures such as the increase to the tax-free threshold, the low-income superannuation contribution, paid parental leave, and now the Labor party has announced an addition to paid parental leave for women\u2019s superannuation.</p> <p>All of these are economic policies which reflect the experience of Australian women.</p> <p>We often hear from some of those opposite sarcastic remarks about \u2018quota girls\u2019, as if none of us on this side have any right to be here.</p> <p>Well, I\u2019d like to ask them this question: why is it that you think women make up so few of the members and senators in your party?</p> <p>Because, since women make up more than 50% of the population, there can really only be two answers: either women are not seen by the males in your party as talented, and therefore not as deserving of a place in this parliament as men, or there is something more systemic preventing women from being elected to parliament as members of the Liberal or National parties.</p> <p>So, unless you are prepared to stand up in this place and argue that, if merit alone determines preselections, women in the Liberal and National parties are consequently only one fifth as meritorious as men, then you accept that there are barriers of prejudice to equal representation.</p> <p>And once you accept there are barriers, then clearly action is required to break those down, and that action is affirmative action.</p> <p>A book I will be launching in the near future by Clare Wright, You Daughters of Freedom, documents how in the early years of the 20th century, other nations looked to Australia with admiration as the land which led the world in universal suffrage, something of which we can be extraordinarily proud.</p> <p>We were a place where women had not only won the vote, but had also won the right to stand for parliament, an almost unheard of concept in the first decades of the 20th century.</p> <p>And yet today, Australia is ranked 50th in the world when it comes to gender diversity in parliament.</p> <p>Where once we led the world, today the latest figures from the Inter-Parliamentary Union show we trail the UK, New Zealand, South Africa, Mexico, Rwanda, Cuba, Slovenia and 42 other nations. And why? Because of the Liberal and National parties.</p> <p>If Labor were the only party in this place Australia would rank fourth in the world.</p> <p>So the debate we have seen over the last few weeks, and the growing recognition something needs to be done to change this, is very welcome, not just for those opposite, but for the parliament as a whole, and for the nation.</p> <p>However, I do sound this word of warning: if the experience in the Labor party is any guide, you do face decades of struggle prosecuting this case, at multiple party conferences.</p> <p>In 1996, the last election where Labor branches could avoid taking action about the fact we had so few women MPs and senators, we were left with just four female MPs, fewer than one in 10 of our lower house members.</p> <p>But with party rules demanding at least 35% of winnable seats go to women, by the next election that number had quadrupled, and women made up over a quarter of our MPs. People such as Julia Gillard, Nicola Roxon and many others entered our parliaments.</p> <p>Since then we have twice lifted our quota, to 40, and then 50%. And today, 46% of our caucus are women and we are on track to achieve equality at the next election.</p> <p>This will be a historic and proud moment \u2013 a party of government, for the first time in this country, accurately reflecting the diversity of the Australian people.</p> <p>It is also proof affirmative action, quotas, whatever term you want to use, work.</p> <p>By contrast, on the government benches, where senior figures routinely deride Labor women as \u2018quota girls\u2019, we see the exact opposite trend occurring.</p> <p>In 1996 there were 18 women sitting as MPs in John Howard\u2019s new government. Twenty-two years and seven prime ministers later, there are just 13 women and we see reports that is likely to drop to single figures after the next election.</p> <p>And there is absolutely no sign this is going to improve. If anything, it will get even worse.</p> <p>In the 13 most marginal Labor seats the government might be expected to target at the next election, in just one [it] has a woman been preselected by the Liberal party.</p> <p>This confirms, I think, that too many people in the Liberal party have a problem with women.</p> <p>And when so few of your numbers are women, this leads to the sorts of behaviour we have seen widely reported in recent weeks \u2013 the claims of bullying, with no fewer than five Liberal women calling out their appalling treatment during the bitter infighting that led to the dumping of the prime minister.</p> <p>And when those few women left are so dismayed by bullying and intimidation that some of them are quitting this parliament, worsening the gender inequality in the Coalition parties, then you create a vicious cycle that sees women marginalised, driven out of parliament, and of course parliament made less attractive to women.</p> <p>For many years the Liberal party sought to disguise its poor record on gender by pointing to Julie Bishop, Australia\u2019s first female minister for foreign affairs. Yet we also saw how the party treated her during the leadership ballot.</p> <p>It\u2019s no wonder the member for Curtin memorably declared she would not be another bloke\u2019s deputy and left the frontbench.</p> <p>However, one point on which I would disagree with the former foreign minister is her reluctance to describe herself as a feminist, something on which she was joined by many women on the other side.</p> <p>The Oxford English dictionary comprises 20 volumes yet its definition of feminism is commendably concise: advocacy of the rights of women based on the theory of equality of the sexes.</p> <p>Christine Wallace, I thought, put this very well in her recent column when she declared this:</p> <p>\u2018The reluctance of Liberal women to name and organise around the liberal feminism they actually practise, psychologically undercuts their power and keeps them in a prone position.</p> <p>\u2018They need to name and unashamedly organise around the set of ideas that can end the present male Liberal monoculture in a way consistent with their political philosophy: that is, liberal feminism.</p> <p>\u2018Every time Ms Bishop and those like her shy [away] from declaring themselves liberal feminists, they pull the rug from under not only their own feet, but also from under the feet of every other Liberal woman around them.\u2019</p> <p>I recognise that some women in the Liberal party are recognising that they need to change their approach and I think that is a good thing.</p> <p>To my way of thinking it is somewhat counterproductive to the cause of equality to be proud of not being feminist</p> <p>As a general rule, not talking about discrimination or inequality has historically not been a successful approach to remedying it. Those in power, and those with control of preselections, rarely cede that power willingly.</p> <p>As the 1970s Equal Pay song put it, don\u2019t be too polite girls!</p> <p>Ultimately you have to decide whether you want to make that change, and how to best prosecute that case, and male leaders have to decide whose side they are on. Are they going to stand against that tide or work with you, as people on our side, from Paul Keating to Simon Crean and Bill Shorten, have chosen to do?</p> <p>Sadly, at this moment, surveying the Coalition benches, I have to say, there are too few male allies.</p> <p>But, when only 17% of your members in the House of Representatives are women, and you are going backwards, you obviously have a problem.</p> <p>When your MPs and senators are routinely referring to women in this place as \u2018quota girls\u2019, \u2018the handbag hit squad\u2019 and calling on them to \u2018roll with the punches\u2019 and to \u2018get out of the kitchen\u2019, you have a problem.</p> <p>And this gets back to the point I raised earlier about the culture of a party, or a parliament and how that is affected by the lack of equal representation.</p> <p>It is time for those opposite to understand that a lack of female representation in this parliament is not only bad for women, and bad for the Liberal party, it is bad for democracy.</p> <p>It is time for those opposite to join the 21st century, to stand up to the bullies, and to support affirmative action so that this parliament, on all sides, whether government or opposition, truly represents the Australian people.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-09-19T05:49:02.942Z\">at 6.49am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ba1cab7e4b0b5565ec2fcda\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-09-19T04:05:55.276Z\">5.05am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/we-both-get-it-scott-morrison-s-bromance-with-donald-trump-20180917-p5049q.html\">The NYT profile</a> on <strong>Scott Morrison</strong> had some great tidbits, including the art in his office.</p> <p>I had never seen this before \u2013 I don\u2019t think a lot of people had \u2013 but here is the \u201cI stopped these\u201d sculpture it mentioned:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BuzzFeedOzPol/status/1042255207722373121\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Here&#39;s the trophy asylum seeker boat the prime minister has as a reminder he stopped them.<a href=\"https://t.co/kXUJHSDtg8\">https://t.co/kXUJHSDtg8</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/ai9NqHDQ92\">pic.twitter.com/ai9NqHDQ92</a></p>&mdash;

The other people were saying the whole agreement is rubbish and we should not do any of it. </p> <p>What we saw was, I thought, a thorough and fair dinkum debate. What we should never do in Australia is confuse debate and disagreement with disunity. I welcome the full range of opinions being expressed are my parliamentary team.

As Bill said, the gap is about $130,000 on average at the moment, about 40% less than men. </p> <p>There is a lot of things that we need to do over time to fix the income gap between men and women. Of course we have to address the gender pay gap during the working lives of women. But we also need to address this retirement income gap. Today\u2019s measures are a significant step towards reducing the unequal retirement incomes of men and women. </p> <p>Today, we are announcing, of course, that we will be paying superannuation to people who are on commonwealth paid parental leave, either maternity leave or dad and partner pay. That is a very big step. We are also progressively getting rid of the $450 per month threshold, below which superannuation currently isn\u2019t paid. </p> <p>We know that more and more people, instead of working one full-time job, work in multiple jobs. They are working part-time, they working cattle, doing seasonal work \u2013 quite often they are missing out on superannuation in all of those jobs. </p> <p>That is also contributing to the retirement income gap between men and women. These two measures combined and the other measures we are detailing today mean that over time we will reduce the gap between men and women\u2019s superannuation. It is absolutely unconscionable that today, in Australia, the fastest-growing group of people moving into homelessness are single, older women.

And what we know is that more and more people are making up one income from lots of small jobs, part-time or casual jobs. </p> <p>So they are missing out on superannuation in each of those jobs.

It\u2019s horrific reading, but important:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Tonight, I\u2019d like to read a passage from a speech given by my fellow disability activist and advocate <strong>Craig Wallace</strong>, who, in 2015, as part of the White Flower Memorial to commemorate all those who died in institutional and residential care, spoke to the sorrow and pain of our community. </p> <p>In concluding, he said, \u2018I call for those who have left us to be remembered, for their names and stories to be said out loud in the sunlight and amongst the people who love them\u2019.</p> <p>Tonight, I seek to speak their names, and though the sun does not shine in this place I hope that their stories will move the hearts of those who have it within their power to see justice done. </p> <p>The following names are those who have died in the lead-up or subsequent to the Senate inquiry which called for a royal commission. </p> <p><strong>Shellay Ward</strong>, aged seven, was found locked in a room without sunlight, surrounded by faeces. Shellay died from starvation and thirst, and she weighed only nine kilograms\u2014a third of her expected body weight. She had severe autism and was considered to be profoundly disabled. </p> <p><strong>Levi Bonnar</strong>, seven years old, was found beaten, tortured and finally killed by the people who were meant to care for him. </p> <p><strong>Hayley Dea Bell</strong> was eight years old. When she was found in 2013 she was starved, suffering from pneumonia and her hair was infested with lice and matted with dirt. </p> <p><strong>Isabella Leiper</strong> was nine. She died from a combination of internal injuries which paediatricians said were caused by blunt force to the stomach, such as a fist. </p> <p><strong>Julian</strong> was 11. He was left to freeze to death in a shed. He had first been hosed with water after having faeces rubbed in his face. </p> <p><strong>Liam Milne</strong> and his younger brother. </p> <p><strong>Craig Sullivan</strong>, 17, who was arrested for a minor driving offence and later bashed by another inmate at the Ashley youth detention centre, died in isolation from a massive brain haemorrhage. </p> <p><strong>Brandon Le Serve</strong> suffered severe learning difficulties and was killed by a family member. </p> <p><strong>Jack Sullivan</strong>, 18, died in state-funded care in the ACT from drowning. </p> <p><strong>Lara Madigan</strong>, 20, was returned to her parents\u2019 care at 19, despite stating that they could not look after her. Nine months before her death, authorities were warned she would die if the situation was not addressed. Two weeks before her death, both of her legs were amputated to attempt to stem infection. She died covered in her own faeces and urine in a room infested with cockroaches. </p> <p><strong>Sarah Hammoud</strong>, 22, a disabled young woman who was unable to speak and reportedly half-dragged and half-carried herself from a taxi after a shocking incident, allegedly witnessed by community workers, later died in hospital in 2016 of septicaemia. </p> <p><strong>Christopher O\u2019Brien</strong>, aged 22. </p> <p><strong>Neil Summerell</strong>. </p> <p><strong>Rebecca Lazarus</strong> was found with multiple stab wounds in her chest and abdomen in a group-care home. </p> <p><strong>Jamie Vincent Johnson</strong>, age undisclosed. His care plan stated that he should not be left alone with water because he would drink it without stopping. He died after being left alone in the shower. </p> <p><strong>Carney Schultz</strong> died in a group home. She had a seizure at 2.23am that was documented by staff and was found dead seven hours later. </p> <p><strong>Shona Hookey</strong>, 29, died as a result of medical neglect in an institutionalised setting. </p> <p><strong>Stephen Ind</strong>, 29, a quadriplegic man who made complaints of sexual assault and misconduct by his carers. He was left face down and suffocated to death. </p> <p><strong>Stuart Lambert</strong>. </p> <p><strong>Melanie Cutmore</strong>, who died in the same hospital and under similar circumstances as Shona Hookey. </p> <p><strong>Brett Ponting</strong>, 33, died after being left unsupervised in a bathtub for an extended period of time. His carers were blamed for negligence. </p> <p><strong>Darren Kingma</strong> died in his respite facility as a result of an unexplained incident in which he broke his neck. He was left on the floor for over an hour after his support workers gave up trying to pull him up, saying that he was being non-compliant. </p> <p><strong>David Veech</strong>. </p> <p><strong>Miriam Merten</strong>, a mother of two who was left naked and covered in faeces at a Lismore psychiatric hospital. </p> <p><strong>Amanda Gilbert</strong>, 47, who had an acquired brain injury as a result of attempted suicide and was placed in the Graylands hospital psychiatric care centre in my home state of WA. She was raped and assaulted 111 times and died as a result of complications used in the medication to sedate her. The WA coroner believes this to have been an underestimation of the number of times that she was raped. </p> <p><strong>Leah Elizabeth Floyd</strong> died when a pressure sore she had received at her care home became septic. The inquest heard about serious issues in the facility that she lived [in]. </p> <p><strong>Julie Jacobson</strong>, a 51-year-old amputee who died a preventable, avoidable death after a private disability support provider withdrew essential supports. </p> <p><strong>Sandra Deacon</strong>, 59. </p> <p><strong>Janice and Robyn Frescura</strong>, 68 and 50. A family friend of the three people who died in a shooting near Hervey Bay says it was a mercy killing. </p> <p><strong>Shirley Thompson</strong>. </p> <p><strong>Janet Mackozdi</strong>. </p> <p><strong>Julie Betty Kuhn</strong>. A 81-year-old from Armadale was charged over his elderly partner\u2019s apparent mercy killing. It was described as a beautiful act of mercy for his wife. </p> <p>These are the names that don\u2019t get spoken. These are the reasons. These are the human beings. These are the loved ones, the mothers, the fathers, the sons and the partners who need justice, who demand justice, whose lives were worth living, in whose memory I tonight wear a white flower and whose passing fills me with an ironclad determination.

          "bodyText": "So tomorrow looks like being interesting! From what I understand, not a lot can happen, even if the no-confidence motion gets up, but it is a terrible, terrible look and not something the government wants at any time, let alone when Scott Morrison is attempting to establish himself as a \u201cstrong\u201d leader. Morrison seized his chance with Australia\u2019s Berry Force today \u2013 and if you don\u2019t think his advisors saw this as the perfect opportunity to display is prime-ministerialness, then you haven\u2019t been paying enough attention \u2013 and for the most part, the government didn\u2019t have to deal with questions on bullying or its lack of women. But, a no-confidence motion in Peter Dutton will change all of that. They\u2019ve tried to keep him out of the spotlight as much as possible \u2013 today\u2019s ABF presser non-withstanding \u2013 with limited dixers and a low profile. No word on what is happening with his section 44 concerns \u2013 but I can\u2019t imagine Labor or the Greens would want to wet all their powder tomorrow \u2013 there is another sitting coming up in three weeks after all. We will bring you all the updates as they come to hand, along with whatever else this insane place brings us. A big thank you to Katharine Murphy and Gareth Hutchens for dragging me over the line today \u2013 I could not do it without them, or the people behind the scenes who clean up the mess my muddled brain and too fast fingers create. Mike Bowers will be back with us tomorrow and I know he missed you as much as you missed him. I\u2019ll be back bright and early as well, but in the mean time \u2013 thank you for hanging out with us today \u2013 and take care of you. Labor hasn\u2019t given an official response as yet, but: And there we go: But it looks like the no-confidence motion against Peter Dutton the government had been pushing against will be put to the lower house tomorrow. No word on what the independents would do \u2013 they wanted to see the report before making any decisions. This is why Ian Macdonald and Eric Abetz don\u2019t believe the report\u2019s findings: This inquiry has been a farcical and shambolic witch-hunt that, despite the hyperbolic majority report, has come up with nothing except findings that mirror the Labor party\u2019s initial talking points which actually fall outside the terms of reference of this inquiry. Despite Labor Senators\u2019 constant changing of the goal posts in order to try and locate a smoking gun, the extensive hearings show that not only is there no smoking gun, there is in fact no gun. The undisputed evidence provided to the Committee was very clear: The evidence has disclosed no instances of inappropriate conduct by the Minister for Home Affairs as has been so recklessly alleged by Labor and Green Senators. The findings listed in the committee report are unsustainable That of the 24 subclass 600 interventions signed by Minister Dutton, only two (the already publicised Brisbane and Adelaide cases) related to au pairs;[1] In both of these cases, the minister accepted the department\u2019s recommendation to grant a short-term visitor visa to the two individuals involved;[2] That neither the minister nor his office had any contact with the department on either the Brisbane or Adelaide cases, other than through the usual channel of the departmental liaison officer;[3] That no additional costs were incurred by the department on the two cases;[4] and The minister acted within ministerial intervention powers as prescribed under the Migration Act 1958 and the department\u2019s guidelines for ministerial intervention. Adam Bandt is one of the first lower house MPs out of the blocks to respond to the Senate report: Peter Dutton has misled parliament over the au pair scandal and the Senate inquiry report confirms this. If he won\u2019t resign, the parliament should take matters into its own hands.\u201d Eric Abetz and Ian Macdonald do not agree with the majority report. They have issued a dissenting report, where they conclude the Senate should recommend: The Minister for Home Affairs be commended for his prudent and diligent work as a minister Mr Quaedvlieg\u2019s correspondence be referred to the privileges committee and be considered as to whether privilege should apply to these documents; and The Minister for Home Affairs ignore the majority report\u2019s findings. And what do they recommend? That the government strengthen the minister\u2019s tabling statements to parliament on ministerial interventions, by requiring the minister\u2019s statements to declare whether or not each ministerial intervention was made in accordance with the ministerial guidelines. The committee recommends that the Senate consider censuring the Minister for Home Affairs (the hon Peter Dutton MP) for the actions examined in this report, when he was the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, for failing to observe fairness in making official decisions as required by the Statement of Ministerial Standards That the minister representing the Minister for Home Affairs provide, within three sitting days, an explanation to the Senate responding to the matters raised in this report. The committee (except for the Coalition senators) has found: It is the view of the committee that Minister Dutton had a clear personal connection and existing relationship with the intended employer of the au pair in the Brisbane case. Given his definitive answer in the House of Representatives, it is the view of the committee the minister misled Parliament in relation to this matter. It is the view of the committee that Minister Dutton acted expeditiously in using his ministerial intervention powers to grant a tourist visa to the au pair in the Adelaide case. Whilst the use of these powers is within his rights as the relevant minister, the committee recognises this request for intervention may not have come to the attention of Minister Dutton prior to the individual\u2019s removal from Australia if it was not for the fact it was raised through personal connections. Minister Dutton appears to have failed to give consideration to the damage to public confidence in the integrity of the immigration system that his actions could cause and, at best, reflects very poor judgement on the part of the minister. In the Adelaide case, Minister Dutton signed the intervention documents despite acting ministerial arrangements being in place. No evidence presented assured the committee that there were any reasons why Minister Dutton signed the ministerial intervention in the Adelaide case rather than acting Minister Keenan, heightening perceptions that Minister Dutton acted due to a personal interest. It is the view of the committee that substantial inconsistencies in evidence provided by the department during the course of the inquiry leaves significant doubt as to whether all relevant ministerial interventions have been captured by the inquiry. Given the broad powers of the immigration minister, any perception of conflict of interest or corruption in relation to the use of ministerial intervention powers is detrimental to the integrity of Australia\u2019s immigration system. While these powers are intended to ensure legitimate cases of humanitarian need or public interest can be addressed, Minister Dutton\u2019s interventions in these au pair cases do not reflect community expectations of how such powers should be used. At best, Minister Dutton\u2019s actions have resulted in a perception, if not an actual, conflict of interest. To ensure transparent and accountable decisions, the government should give serious consideration to strengthening the minister\u2019s statement to parliament, requiring the minister\u2019s statement to declare that the ministerial intervention was made in accordance with the ministerial guidelines, thereby maintaining community confidence in the integrity of Australia\u2019s immigration system. You can find the whole report \u2013 including the Coalition senator\u2019s dissenting report \u2013 here. Louise Pratt: \u201cI can\u2019t think of all the extraordinary humanitarian cases which require intervention, but this is an extraordinary level of service provided by the minister\u2019s office which underscores the minister\u2019s [personal involvement]\u201d. \u201cThere is no basis for the minister to say he had no personal connection, when the very genesis of the request came through his office because of a personal connection,\u201d Louise Pratt says. She said the committee has found (I would imagine there is a dissenting report) that it has undermined the integrity of the immigration department. Given how strong Pratt\u2019s language is here, I think we will be seeing a no confidence motion coming the parliament\u2019s way. \u201cIt is the view of the committee that the minister misled the parliament in this matter,\u201d Louise Pratt says, in handing down the report. The Senate is receiving the Peter Dutton report as I type this. The Greens have released this statement: The Senate has today ordered the government to table the Ruddock review by 9.30am Thursday, after a passing a motion from the Australian Greens. Greens LGBTIQ+ spokesperson Janet Rice said: \u201cLGBTIQ+ communities have been left in the lurch for months awaiting the release of this report. Our rights are at stake and we\u2019re being kept in the dark. \u201cScott Morrison\u2019s recent anti-LQBTIQ+ comments have ignited fear in our communities that the government is planning to wind back the laws which protect LGBTIQ+ people from discrimination. \u201cWe need to know to what extent he is planning to further discriminate against everyday LGBTIQ+ Australians in order to shore up the support of powerful religious institutions.\u201d Greens justice spokesperson Nick McKim said: \u201cThe prime minister has already has made it clear that he has plans to dismantle anti-discrimination laws. \u201cThe far right lost the marriage equality debate and now they want revenge and are going to try to entrench discrimination in other parts of society. \u201cWe will fight them every step of the way.\u201d Feel free to pass this on to anyone you know who it could interest. It is very easy to be cynical about politics, but it\u2019s the most important thing in the world and we keep trying to make it better \u2013 and generation Z have a pretty good chance of making that happen: The senate inquiry report into Peter Dutton\u2019s au pair decision is due to be handed down very soon - we are keeping an eye on the committee website for you. \u201cI\u2019ve got leftwing branches in my conference, I\u2019ve got conservative branches in my conference ... and some of them [the left] were attached to the former prime minister,\u201d he says. He says that the votes for the empty chair were in response to that and \u201cthat is understandable\u201d. From the prime minister\u2019s office: Over the past few days, we have seen a very distressing series of events unfold relating to tampering with strawberries, particularly out of Queensland. This is a shocking and cowardly thing to do. The Liberal-National government is acting to increase the penalties on the cowards who commit these crimes. Our priorities are to keep Australians safe and support the farmers whose livelihoods have been put at risk. We are announcing: $1m to make more food safety officials urgently available to increase detection, fast-track recalls and assist the strawberry industry to rebuild confidence. An increase to the penalty for existing offences relating to the contamination of goods. These offences currently carry a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. Given the seriousness of the offences, this penalty is not high enough. The changes we are making elevate the offence, in terms of penalties, from one similar to forgery or theft of commonwealth property (which carry a penalty of up to 10 years in prison), to one akin to possession of child pornography or funding a terrorist organisation (which attract penalties of up to 15 years imprisonment). New offences of being reckless as to whether this type of conduct will cause harm, which will carry a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. For the most serious cases that have national security implications, we will amend the commonwealth sabotage offences to ensure that sabotage of Australia\u2019s food supply is captured by the sabotage offences. The penalties range between 7 and 25 years imprisonment. The government will introduce its new criminal legislation tomorrow. These actions reflect the seriousness with which the government views the current threats against Australian industry and, in particular, the livelihoods of growers, communities, towns and whole regions. This government remains committed to working closely with industry, and state and territory law enforcement agencies to ensure that we protect Australian consumers and protect our farmers. Families need to have the assurance that the Australian produce they are buying is safe for their kids. The prime minister is having a chat to Miranda Devine as part of her Miranda Devine Live show this afternoon. I missed this yesterday \u2013 but the Manly Daily, Tony Abbott\u2019s local paper, had an interview with the former prime minister regarding the empty chair challenge, and when it comes to the insurgency against him, he blames, well, I\u2019ll let him tell you: Tony Abbott has taken aim at members of his own electoral conference who voted against his endorsement for the 2019 election labelling them a \u2018small minority of ultra-leftists\u2019. Ultra. Leftists. In the Liberal party\u2019s northern beaches. 2018 just keeps bringing all of the gifts. The first instalment of a $30m handout to Foxtel by the Coalition was spent on 12 sports that were previously shown on the pay TV carrier and that include men\u2019s rugby league, a freedom of information request from Fairfax Media has revealed. The $30m windfall for Foxtel was meant to \u201csupport the broadcast of underrepresented sports on subscription television, including women\u2019s sports, niche sports, and sports with a high level of community involvement and participation\u201d when it was announced in the 2016 budget. But the $7.5m allocated for the 2017-18 financial year was used to screen the AFL, soccer, rugby union, rugby league, cycling, lawn bowls, surfing, Ironman, surf lifesaving, cricket, basketball and hockey, some of which are already seen on free-to-air. There has been very little explanation from either Foxtel or the government about how the subscription broadcaster will use the funds or why they were allocated. An earlier freedom of information request by the ABC revealed there was no paperwork to explain why the government had given the funds to Foxtel. Laura Jayes from Sky just raised the point that the deputy prime minister and leader of the Nationals \u2013 you know, the party which mostly represents farmers in this place \u2013 was not beside Scott Morrison when he made the strawberry contamination crackdown announcement. He\u2019s not in the videos either. The Australian Berry Force is on the case: So I guess the takeaway from that is meetings are dumb, but summits are cool. Scott Morrison, continuing his new tradition of telling us exactly how many questions we have suffered through, tells us today, 23 is enough, and calls an end to today\u2019s torture. Tony Burke to Scott Morrison: Why won\u2019t the prime minister fulfil the commitment he made to the house last week and say whether or not the minister for home affairs excuse himself from discussions on childcare? Morrison: Once again, I refer to the statement by the minister on 13 September, where he said he complied with the requirements under the cabinet handbook and I take advice in relation to this position which puts the question beyond doubt. The cabinet handbook is a public document. Here it is, quite straightforward; the wording is quite clear. It does not say whatever the opposition wants it to say to suit the political purposes they try to pursue in this parliament. I have nothing further to report on that matter, Mr Speaker. It has been absolutely cleared up and I am happy for the matter to rest. EXTREME Jonathan Van Ness voice (from Queer Eye) \u201cBut has it? Because...I don\u2019t think it has, hunny.\u201d Tony Burke to Scott Morrison: Last week the prime minister said to come back after making inquiries of the secretary as to whether the minister for home affairs excuse himself on questions on childcare. Now that the prime minister has had a week to make inquiries, did the minister for home affairs excuse himself from all discussions on childcare? Morrison: I refer the member to the statement made by the minister for home affairs on this matter and I have nothing further to report. One would think if they had the answer, and it proved their point, we would have heard about it by now. Sometimes, you really can say it best, when you say nothing at all. Cathy McGowan and Rebehka Shakie had a message for their own for the women of Australia: \u2018Don\u2019t get mad, get elected\u2019: a message to all of Australia\u2019s Independent women. After all, Independents have all the fun! The poster was created by the Victorian Women\u2019s Trust, for those wondering. Hello again, I\u2019m just adding to information I shared earlier about the new material on Peter Dutton\u2019s use of ministerial discretion in relation to au pairs. The material, as I said earlier, makes clear that officials warned Dutton that costs would be incurred as a consequence of the planned removal of the young woman detained in Adelaide not proceeding because of the minister\u2019s intervention. Dutton\u2019s office has pointed me in the direction of a question on notice that has been submitted to the Senate inquiry. It says no additional costs were incurred. I\u2019m sharing it with you in full for completeness. Senator Watt: I noticed in this case that the minister was advised that there may be some additional costs to the department if the intervention occurred and this person was allowed to stay in the country. From reading between the lines of the submission, it seems that maybe an airfare was booked. Because, ordinarily, what would happen is that this person comes in \u2013 Mr Pezzullo: I\u2019m a public official: I don\u2019t read between the lines; I just read the lines. Senator Watt: Ordinarily, had the intervention not occurred, she would have been deported. Mr Murray: Senator, I can help you there. In that case, the visa had been cancelled and was then subject of removal. As part of the migration provisions, we\u2019d already served notice on the airline. They have 72 hours to effect the removal. Mr Pezzullo: That\u2019s reflected at paragraph 16 of the released submission. Senator Watt: I\u2019m interested to know: did the department, ABF or any entity of the government incur any costs as a result of the fact that she didn\u2019t end up being deported? Mr Murray: I don\u2019t believe so, no. Mr Outram: We\u2019ll take that on notice. Senator Watt: It was flagged that that might occur. Mr Outram: We\u2019ll take that on notice. As I said, there are 4,500 cases where we cancel visas at the border and it\u2019s\u2014I want to impress upon you the degree of churn here. This is a high-volume, high-paced operation at the border and, with those sorts of turnarounds, we try to do them on the day sometimes even where people don\u2019t even go into detention centres. So I will come back to you as to whether there was an actual cost incurred with regard to the airfares. So what was the answer provided to the committee on notice? \u201cNo additional cost on these matters were incurred.\u201d I\u2019ve asked the minister\u2019s office if they can explain why officials warned costs would be incurred as a consequence of the removal not proceeding, and square that with this answer to the committee saying no additional costs were incurred. If an answer is forthcoming, I will share it. Bill Shorten to Scott Morrison: Why isn\u2019t Malcolm Turnbull prime minister? (He says it\u2019s a question Morrison has failed to answer on 21 different occasions) Morrison: I refer the member to my earlier answers and simply say he has had five years and he can\u2019t convince anyone that he should be the prime minister. Right. So Coag was cancelled, because there is a drought summit. But the drought summit is being held weeks after Coag was due to be held. So now Coag has been cancelled, because Scott Morrison doesn\u2019t believe in standing around having meetings. But the drought summit is a meeting. So Coag was cancelled because... Morrison: When people tell lies and repeat them, it doesn\u2019t make them any more true. That is a fundamental principle. When people tell lies, it doesn\u2019t make them any more true the more you repeat them. Most people know that. What I said in a very plain answer to the last question was simply this: I don\u2019t think you need to have a meeting if you don\u2019t need to have a meeting. You don\u2019t need to have meetings for everybody to come and have a cup of tea. The reason we don\u2019t have to have that meeting is because the very education funding issues that are referred to by the member will be addressed within that time frame. ... The conversation I had with the premiers when I called each of them and I spoke to each of them and none of them raised a concern with the meeting, not one, because they knew where the progress of those matters when it came to education funding was up to. Previously as treasurer I had been progressing those matters through the council of federal financial relations and they will be resolved. But on this side of the house, we don\u2019t think you had to have meetings just for the sake of it. You just get on and do the job, Mr Speaker. Now the shadow treasurer is terribly irritated because there is not going to be a meeting. What I know about the shadow treasurer is this: when he was immigration minister, people couldn\u2019t trust him on the border, can\u2019t trust him on budget either. The Australian people know about me, that they can trust me on the borders and they can trust me on the budget because that\u2019s my record. Well this is a sobering thought: Chris Bowen to Scott Morrison: Essentially \u2013 why did you cancel Coag? Remember when you cancelled parliament for a week? Why do you keep cancelling things? Morrison: You know why we are not having that in October? Because we are having a drought summit. That is what I announced today. We are having a drought summit. The jeers that come from the opposition in the Labor party when I say we are having a drought summit tells us a bit about where their priorities [are] ... They want to come in here and go on with all this political rubbish day after day after day. Earlier today I met with the deputy prime minister and I met with the member for New England [Barnaby Joyce]. I met with the head of the National Farmers\u2019 Federation. I met with Maj Gen Steven Day and we received their update on work that was done by Maj Gen Steven Day, who is coordinating the government\u2019s response to the drought. And on 26 October as we will ring together people from around the country. I will invite all the state and territory leaders or their nominees or those within their government directly involved in coordinating the drought response to come and align all our efforts to ensure we are doing a number of things. Firstly, that we are getting the feed to where it needs to get to, to support the efforts of our farmers, to keep their properties going and to keep them in business, to support the towns, support the centres, support, make sure ... Tony Burke interrupts to make the point I just raised in the office \u2013 that Coag was scheduled for early October, but the drought summit isn\u2019t until the end: The question went to collect meeting scheduled for 4 October, not the drought summit scheduled for 26 October. He was asked about a different meeting. But Morrison continues to say how he is not standing around having \u201ca bunch of meetings\u201d. But correct me if I am wrong \u2013 and I often am \u2013 but isn\u2019t a drought summit, basically a giant meeting? Julie Collins to Ken Wyatt: Has the per-resident funding for the complex high care aged care funding instrument gone down as a result of the 2016 budget? Wyatt (after originally trying to compare it to 2012 levels): The funding for ACFI expenditure has continued to increase against claims across all three domains. Julie Collins to Ken Wyatt: I refer to his previous answer where he denied blaming the new prime minister for [hitting] the age care sector with a $1.2bn cut. If it wasn\u2019t the prime minister\u2019s fault, which person was responsible for cutting $1.2bn from aged care? Wyatt: The question you have asked is inaccurate. We have continued to increase funding as I have said from $13.1bn through to $18.6bn through to another $5bn to $23.6bn, and we are continuing to have work undertaken in respect to the ACFI instrument, which has served the sector well. The funding instrument was capped at a time in which there were claims that were much higher than the trajectory and all governments have a responsibility to live within their means. And within the budget that is established. Now, but we have not cut, because we have continued to grow the ACFI level of funding over the forward estimates and they will continue to grow, but the new RUCKS program that we are working on with Wollongong University will provide a better instrument for people assessing people. As you heard in the Four Corners program, by their own admission, staff were told to game the instrument. Just a reminder that both Labor and the government are right \u2013 like in health and education, funding has increased, but not by as much as was anticipated. Tveeder, which is the transcription service I use to help me get these answers up as quickly as possible, keeps referring to the prime minister as the \u201cpie minister\u201d and combined with all this strawberry talk, I am now STARVING. Peter Dutton has been allowed to give a dixer answer today \u2013 and it is on strawberries. Mostly. He does get this in, at the end: I also want to take the opportunity today to acknowledge work being done by the Australian federal police in concert with the other state policing agencies and in fact all law enforcement agencies across the country in relation to countering child exploitation. This is a serious threat to families. Mums and dads are worried about kids online. They are worried about images of being uploaded. They are worried about predators not just in the park, next door or down the street; they are worried about kids online in the hours spent online. And last week we announced $70m investment into the centre for countering child exploitation, and that is a commonwealth-led effort that involves the other policing agencies as well. We know that shockingly every seven minutes a webpage shows a child being sexually abused. We know that through the money that we have put into the Australian federal police, they have received additional funding in the 2018-19 budget which includes that money as I said before, and the centre will remove 200 children from danger in the first year alone, and it builds on the work we have done to cancel the visas of people who have been involved in sexual offences against children and women, and we will build on that work every day of this government. Julie Collins to Ken Wyatt: Is the minister aware of a report that while visiting a nursing home he conceded the government\u2019s $1.2bn cuts to aged care was hurting, saying these things are controlled by treasury. Can the minister explain why the then treasurer [denied making] the $1.2bn cut to aged care, and is this why the prime minister described his own government as a Muppet show? Wyatt: The report in the paper is not accurate and it is not a comment that I would make when I am in an aged care facility. The decisions around funding and our increased funding going from $13.7bn to $18.6bn to $23.6bn is an increase in our budgets are continuing to grow. In terms of the active instrument, the work undertaken at the moment, it is looking at the RUCKS program and we will continue to work with the department on the reforms required. Andrew Wilkie has today\u2019s crossbench question \u2013 and it\u2019s on why Tasmanians have to wait so long to see specialists. Scott Morrison is listing the funding the government has previously announced, and says that [Tasmanian premier] Will Hodgman is helping them deliver it. It doesn\u2019t look like Wilkie is overly impressed. Nope, he\u2019s not. He asks about relevance, but the PM has concluded his answer. Chris Bowen to Scott Morrison: People earning less than $450 a month don\u2019t have to be paid superannuation. This means that many women in low-paid casual jobs can\u2019t build up their retirement savings. When will the government stopped fighting itself, start governing and match this commitment to help women in low-paid and casual jobs plan for security in retirement by ensuring that superannuation is paid to those Australians earning less than $450 month. Morrison: Our government has acted to provide catch-up contributions for women in the work force. Our government has acted for those women starting their own businesses, those working from home to now access the superannuation tax concessions that others can access, and I don\u2019t understand why the Labor party oppose those measures. Why would the Labor party want to oppose someone running their own business from home, getting access to the same superannuation tax concessions that are enjoyed by other female workers? These provisions particularly support those in trades and small businesses but it does include those who run their own home-based businesses. What that shows is they are happy to support the superannuation savings of those who are in the union workforce, but they are not happy to support the superannuation savings of people who run small- and medium-sized businesses. The Labor party has never understood the psychology or the incentive or the mindset of someone who decides to run their own business. Who wants the independence and takes the risk and goes out there to ensure that they can provide for their future, and Mr Speaker, that betrayal by the Labor party is also demonstrated \u2013 they want to talk about retirement savings. If they are so interested in retirement savings, why do they want to put their hand in the pocket of senior Australians who have saved and take around $5bn out of their savings, and do you know who the biggest burden of that retirees tax fall on? Women. Thirty per cent more women will be impacted by the Labor party\u2019s retiree tax. Sucking $5bn out of the pockets of hard-working Australian families, and at that time when women are on their own, when their partners may have been deceased and passed on, what was left to them, what was left them in the shares that they had in Telstra, all the shares that they had in one of the Australian company they had, that\u2019s the money, that shadow treasurer, that leader of the Labor party wants to get their grubby hands on, and we won\u2019t allow it. Tanya Plibersek to Scott Morrison: Can the prime minister confirmed this government has hit the retirement savings of Australian women by supporting cuts to penalty rates, abolishing the low-income superannuation contribution before being shamed into bringing it back, and delaying the increase in the superannuation guarantee? Doesn\u2019t this just confirm this government\u2019s failure to increase the representation of women in important national institutions have a real and lasting impact on the everyday lives of Australian women? Morrison hands it to Kelly O\u2019Dwyer: I thank the member for her question, and it is very important to place on the record that there has been no cut to penalty rates by the government. The government has made no decision to cut penalty rates, as she well knows. When the leader of the opposition was the minister responsible, he was involved in setting up the Fair Work Commission. The Fair Work Commission and all of the architecture around it can be laid at the feet of the leader of the opposition. The Fair Work Commission has made decisions regarding penalty rates for five awards and they haven\u2019t abolished those penalty rates for the awards as those opposite would have us believe. They have made some adjustments. Now, what they have done, for instance, for public holidays, is they have changed, the Fair Work Commission has changed it from double time and a half to double time and a quarter, so it is still there. It is completely false for the deputy leader to make a suggestion. And it deserves to be called out in this house. But as she should know, it is the people who are sitting on their side of the chamber who have been working hard to ensure the financial security of Australian women. We have been doing that because we have wanted to increase the job opportunities for Australian women. And under our government, there are more women in work than ever before. It is very hard ... It is very hard to be on the path to financial security if you do not have a job. And it is this side of the house that has been working incredibly hard to put in place important superannuation reforms that would provide flexibility so that women who want to actually catch up on their superannuation contributions can do so under our measures, measures that would be scrapped by those opposite. We have levelled the playing field. We have levelled the playing field to make sure that anyone regardless of their circumstances can make a personal deduction and have the same concessions with their superannuation, which costs us more than $1bn to do that. But the thing that they could really do to actually help the security of Australian women would be to support the government\u2019s protecting your super legislation. That legislation would protect Australian workers, protect hard-working Australian people from the rorts and rip-offs in the superannuation sector but they are going to stand with high, fee paying funds, high-speed charging funds and they will stand with the big insurers, not the Australian people. Roman Quaedvlieg has written to the au pair Senate inquiry \u2013 and he is not backing down (it looks like it was sent on 16 September) and has now been tabled: My very strong view is that I am appropriately engaged with the committee as a non-compellable witness who has not yet provided my full evidence pending comprehensive discovery processes being completed. It is a blight on the parliament and it erodes the integrity of the Senate committee\u2019s deliberations that I can be so publicly, gratuitously and unashamedly attacked in the manner in which I have described, particularly by an active member of the committee, before the full evidence has even been adduced. It is beyond my knowledge to state definitively what is motivating government members to mount and sustain this attack on me. I am obviously aware that my evidence thus far contradicts the minister\u2019s statements on the issue of visa interventions but to put this into context, mine is simply one piece of evidence in a much broader mosaic and the minister has the absolute prerogative to contest facts, put evidence before the committee, either in writing or in person, without resorting to public attacks. Minister Dutton\u2019s incendiary remarks in question time on 11 September came immediately after he took a question without notice, which in part referenced an article in the Age that day alleging he inappropriately sought to influence recruitment processes for two Queensland police service officers seeking employment with the Australian Border Force. While I have detailed knowledge of those recruitment events, it is evident from the Age article that I was not the source of the article, nor have I made any public comments on the events. It is also totally disconnected from the matters under the committee\u2019s inquiry. I can only presume therefore that my engagement with the committee, coupled with other presumptions on his part in a broader suspicion, have catalysed these discrediting attacks. I contend that this unprecedented behaviour not only impedes the committee\u2019s current inquiry and jeopardises the veracity of its ultimate findings, but establishes a wicked disincentive for any non-compellable witness to attend future Senate inquiries to present relevant evidence. I am willing to continue to cooperate with the committee inquiry. However, before I do so, I ask for you to ensure a comprehensive discovery activity is undertaken by the department of home affairs, not just for the provision of ministerial intervention briefs, which fall into the parameters of the committee\u2019s inquiry, but for the provision of data which I have identified in my second submission. I am adamant the conversation I have described in both of my submissions took place and I am equally adamant that departmental and ABF records exist which corroborate the statements made in my submissions. While this latest dixer takes away more minutes of my life I will never get back, Penny Wong delivered a speech to the Senate about inclusion: I want to make a contribution today about a more equal and a more representative parliament. For some weeks now we have seen those opposite consumed by a long overdue debate on how it is that deep into the 21st century just one in five of the government\u2019s members and senators are women, and what they can do to turn this around. I say it is long overdue not to score a political point here, but because of a more fundamental principle; regardless of race, sexuality, religion, ethnicity or gender, we should be striving for a society where all people are judged on their abilities alone. This is a principle that certainly guides my public life. It is a principle of Australian democracy and it is a principle the Labor party holds dear. This principle includes making sure that the parliament is more equal, both in its numbers and in its practices. Because without one, you will not get the other. A parliament that is more representative of the Australian people will be one that acts, and behaves in a way that more closely is aligned with the community expectations of the Australian people, and the make-up of the Australian people. And that change is also necessary to make parliament a more attractive and better career option for Australian women. For over a quarter of a century now our party has been committed to this goal of making our party better represent the Australian people and reflecting the principle of equality by ensuring more women were elected to federal, state and territory parliaments. Labor supports affirmative action not just because we think women have just as much right as men to serve in this place and others, but also because we think this parliament is a better place when it more closely reflects the people we represent. And we support affirmative action because it is the best way to tackle and defeat the systemic failures in our political system. It also changes culture and it changes policy. Recall it was a Labor government that put in place measures such as the increase to the tax-free threshold, the low-income superannuation contribution, paid parental leave, and now the Labor party has announced an addition to paid parental leave for women\u2019s superannuation. All of these are economic policies which reflect the experience of Australian women. We often hear from some of those opposite sarcastic remarks about \u2018quota girls\u2019, as if none of us on this side have any right to be here. Well, I\u2019d like to ask them this question: why is it that you think women make up so few of the members and senators in your party? Because, since women make up more than 50% of the population, there can really only be two answers: either women are not seen by the males in your party as talented, and therefore not as deserving of a place in this parliament as men, or there is something more systemic preventing women from being elected to parliament as members of the Liberal or National parties. So, unless you are prepared to stand up in this place and argue that, if merit alone determines preselections, women in the Liberal and National parties are consequently only one fifth as meritorious as men, then you accept that there are barriers of prejudice to equal representation. And once you accept there are barriers, then clearly action is required to break those down, and that action is affirmative action. A book I will be launching in the near future by Clare Wright, You Daughters of Freedom, documents how in the early years of the 20th century, other nations looked to Australia with admiration as the land which led the world in universal suffrage, something of which we can be extraordinarily proud. We were a place where women had not only won the vote, but had also won the right to stand for parliament, an almost unheard of concept in the first decades of the 20th century. And yet today, Australia is ranked 50th in the world when it comes to gender diversity in parliament. Where once we led the world, today the latest figures from the Inter-Parliamentary Union show we trail the UK, New Zealand, South Africa, Mexico, Rwanda, Cuba, Slovenia and 42 other nations. And why? Because of the Liberal and National parties. If Labor were the only party in this place Australia would rank fourth in the world. So the debate we have seen over the last few weeks, and the growing recognition something needs to be done to change this, is very welcome, not just for those opposite, but for the parliament as a whole, and for the nation. However, I do sound this word of warning: if the experience in the Labor party is any guide, you do face decades of struggle prosecuting this case, at multiple party conferences. In 1996, the last election where Labor branches could avoid taking action about the fact we had so few women MPs and senators, we were left with just four female MPs, fewer than one in 10 of our lower house members. But with party rules demanding at least 35% of winnable seats go to women, by the next election that number had quadrupled, and women made up over a quarter of our MPs. People such as Julia Gillard, Nicola Roxon and many others entered our parliaments. Since then we have twice lifted our quota, to 40, and then 50%. And today, 46% of our caucus are women and we are on track to achieve equality at the next election. This will be a historic and proud moment \u2013 a party of government, for the first time in this country, accurately reflecting the diversity of the Australian people. It is also proof affirmative action, quotas, whatever term you want to use, work. By contrast, on the government benches, where senior figures routinely deride Labor women as \u2018quota girls\u2019, we see the exact opposite trend occurring. In 1996 there were 18 women sitting as MPs in John Howard\u2019s new government. Twenty-two years and seven prime ministers later, there are just 13 women and we see reports that is likely to drop to single figures after the next election. And there is absolutely no sign this is going to improve. If anything, it will get even worse. In the 13 most marginal Labor seats the government might be expected to target at the next election, in just one [it] has a woman been preselected by the Liberal party. This confirms, I think, that too many people in the Liberal party have a problem with women. And when so few of your numbers are women, this leads to the sorts of behaviour we have seen widely reported in recent weeks \u2013 the claims of bullying, with no fewer than five Liberal women calling out their appalling treatment during the bitter infighting that led to the dumping of the prime minister. And when those few women left are so dismayed by bullying and intimidation that some of them are quitting this parliament, worsening the gender inequality in the Coalition parties, then you create a vicious cycle that sees women marginalised, driven out of parliament, and of course parliament made less attractive to women. For many years the Liberal party sought to disguise its poor record on gender by pointing to Julie Bishop, Australia\u2019s first female minister for foreign affairs. Yet we also saw how the party treated her during the leadership ballot. It\u2019s no wonder the member for Curtin memorably declared she would not be another bloke\u2019s deputy and left the frontbench. However, one point on which I would disagree with the former foreign minister is her reluctance to describe herself as a feminist, something on which she was joined by many women on the other side. The Oxford English dictionary comprises 20 volumes yet its definition of feminism is commendably concise: advocacy of the rights of women based on the theory of equality of the sexes. Christine Wallace, I thought, put this very well in her recent column when she declared this: \u2018The reluctance of Liberal women to name and organise around the liberal feminism they actually practise, psychologically undercuts their power and keeps them in a prone position. \u2018They need to name and unashamedly organise around the set of ideas that can end the present male Liberal monoculture in a way consistent with their political philosophy: that is, liberal feminism. \u2018Every time Ms Bishop and those like her shy [away] from declaring themselves liberal feminists, they pull the rug from under not only their own feet, but also from under the feet of every other Liberal woman around them.\u2019 I recognise that some women in the Liberal party are recognising that they need to change their approach and I think that is a good thing. To my way of thinking it is somewhat counterproductive to the cause of equality to be proud of not being feminist As a general rule, not talking about discrimination or inequality has historically not been a successful approach to remedying it. Those in power, and those with control of preselections, rarely cede that power willingly. As the 1970s Equal Pay song put it, don\u2019t be too polite girls! Ultimately you have to decide whether you want to make that change, and how to best prosecute that case, and male leaders have to decide whose side they are on. Are they going to stand against that tide or work with you, as people on our side, from Paul Keating to Simon Crean and Bill Shorten, have chosen to do? Sadly, at this moment, surveying the Coalition benches, I have to say, there are too few male allies. But, when only 17% of your members in the House of Representatives are women, and you are going backwards, you obviously have a problem. When your MPs and senators are routinely referring to women in this place as \u2018quota girls\u2019, \u2018the handbag hit squad\u2019 and calling on them to \u2018roll with the punches\u2019 and to \u2018get out of the kitchen\u2019, you have a problem. And this gets back to the point I raised earlier about the culture of a party, or a parliament and how that is affected by the lack of equal representation. It is time for those opposite to understand that a lack of female representation in this parliament is not only bad for women, and bad for the Liberal party, it is bad for democracy. It is time for those opposite to join the 21st century, to stand up to the bullies, and to support affirmative action so that this parliament, on all sides, whether government or opposition, truly represents the Australian people. The NYT profile on Scott Morrison had some great tidbits, including the art in his office. I had never seen this before \u2013 I don\u2019t think a lot of people had \u2013 but here is the \u201cI stopped these\u201d sculpture it mentioned: I missed the first part of it, but it was from Bill Shorten to Scott Morrison, and essentially, is about whether or not the government will support Labor\u2019s newly announced superannuation policy. Morrison starts of his answer by listing all of the superannuation reforms Labor has not supported. So things are going well. From the office of Penny Wong: Labor joins with the government in strongly condemning the atrocities committed in Myanmar\u2019s Rakhine, Shan and Kachin states. The full report of the UN fact-finding mission on Myanmar finds that: \u2018Gross human rights violations and serious violations of international humanitarian law have been committed in Myanmar since 2011 and that many of these violations undoubtedly amount to the gravest crimes under international law. \u2018The gross human rights violations and abuses committed in Kachin, Rakhine and Shan states are shocking for their horrifying nature and ubiquity.\u2019 The report makes clear the Myanmar military, or Tatmadaw, is directly responsible for these gross human rights violations, \u2018including sexual and gender-based violence and grave violations against children\u2019 and that its leadership must be removed. The report concludes that there is now sufficient evidence to warrant an investigation and prosecutions for genocide perpetrated against the Rohingya. The Myanmar government can no longer ignore its responsibilities and must now act to rein in the Tatmadaw, and hold to account those responsible for these horrific crimes. Labor welcomes the government\u2019s commitment to work with the international community, including considering targeted sanctions, and use our position on the UN human rights council to bring accountability and justice to Myanmar. The development of strong democratic practices and institutions - including the protection of human rights - is crucial to Myanmar\u2019s long-term prosperity. Holy moly it is almost question time. I\u2019ve switched over to play who\u2019s that MP..... And it\u2019s Susan Lamb Under pressure when asked again, if it is normal to take someone off a plane as was in the Adelaide case, Peter Dutton says: You can\u2019t have ministerial intervention after someone has been deported. The opportunity for the minister to do that is while the person is still in Australia or in immigration detention. From my perspective, and I suspect from yours as well, no surprise is when you read a Labor-Greens report that dominated for political reasons ... The witnesses have been discredited and I think you will see it pretty obvious what they recommend by way of recommendations. I would brace yourself for that. Question time should be interesting. Peter Dutton said there was no cost to the commonwealth. But the department advised it would be charged for the flight: It\u2019s always challenging to read more than 100 pages of material in five minutes and produce something sensible, but let\u2019s give it a crack. Here\u2019s my main takeout from the new material. 1. It\u2019s very clear that the minister\u2019s office was in overdrive to try and get these cases resolved. Dutton was at the airport, about to leave the country, when the submission regarding the Adelaide au pair was delivered to him to sign. 2. We also know that taxpayers picked up the costs when Peter Dutton intervened in the Adelaide au pair case. The woman was on the plane, about to be deported. She was taken off the Emirates flight. 3. The ABF advised Dutton not to intervene in the Adelaide case. It\u2019s very clear in the correspondence. 4. In the Brisbane case (involving Dutton\u2019s former Queensland police colleague), the minister\u2019s office let the host family know the intervention had happened. Labor says that level of attention to detail is unusual. Peter Dutton is now being questioned on the content of the emails, the highlights of which you\u2019ll find below. Is he comfortable he acted within ministerial guidelines? I don\u2019t want to pre-empt the report of the Labor-Greens Senate inquiry, so I don\u2019t want you to be surprised I don\u2019t want you to be surprised that when you got a Labor-Greens-majority Senate report, which is nothing more than a witch-hunt ... I suspect, and again, without pre-empting or spoiling your surprise, suspect they\u2019re going to say I\u2019m a bad person. The evidence went back up but that will be the claim made by Labor and the Greens. That\u2019s their political angle they want to take. They thought they had a star witness who proved to be discredited. There is no third case, as referred to by one of the witnesses ... The witness didn\u2019t come forward to be cross-examined. This is nothing more than a witch-hunt. It was always the case and, if they can point to something to the contrary, let them do that. But I suspect they can\u2019t because they haven\u2019t provided the evidence and that was clear in the inquiry. It will be a political report with political recommendations from the Labor party and the Greens, who have the numbers on that committee, and I\u2019m sorry to spoil your surprise.\u201d Does every case get this sort of personal attention? Again, have a look at the thousands of cases and immigration minister deals with on a yearly basis across administrations. Contact is made through members of parliament. Cases are presented to my office on the phone, people ringing up my office every day, sending emails in to my MP address. The queries come in through a number of ways. We can ask for information in relation to those cases. The two issues you talk about don\u2019t deviate from normal practice, not for me as immigration minister, not for Chris Bowen as immigration minister [when Labor was in government], and many before that. But does every case get that sort of attention? In terms of the assessment, I look at matters on their merit, and as I reported the other day to the house, cases I intervene going back to the previous point, when kids are involved, when they are sick, when there\u2019s an aged parent with a terminal illness, the end of their visa period and being deported, advising me they should be deported, I overturn the decision of the department. That\u2019s the whole idea of ministerial intervention. The case of a lady wanting to go to a funeral, I intervened in a matter of hours in relation to that. That\u2019s been the history of immigration ministers. Despite Pauline Hanson labelling the contamination \u201cterrorism\u201d Peter Dutton asks for some perspective: We need to put this in perspective. What we are dealing with is trying to identify who is at the source of the original offence, the original crime, that is under investigation obviously. We have a number of people who are across jurisdictions obviously and they are uploading photos, they are being a copycat of the regional offence. That\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on at the moment. If people have information, we want them to contact Crime Stoppers as soon as they can. AFP boss Andrew Colvin said most of the strawberry contamination reports have been hoaxes: The minister has mentioned over 100 incidents have been reported. I say incidents reported loosely because we do believe that a large number of these are fake, or they are hoax incidents. That\u2019s a significant distraction of police resources at a time when we need to focus on finding out the perpetrators of what is a very serious criminal offence. On that point, let me say this, and let me be very clear: if there\u2019s anyone that thinks this is in any way ... appropriate to walk into a supermarket anywhere in this country and place a foreign object into a piece of fruit, or they think it\u2019s anyway appropriate or amusing to take a photo of fruit they may already have and to put an object into it and put it on Facebook or Twitter and to spread it around and contact health authorities, they are seriously deluded and they are potentially committing serious criminal offences. On top of that, the minister\u2019s office contacted the Adelaide au pair host family to alert them to the decision Peter Dutton had decided to use his ministerial discretion to let her stay. That\u2019s from page 58. So, that was a very, very quick speed read. But according to page 146 of that 169 email dump of the Peter Dutton au pair visa saga, the Australian Border Force officials were very against having their decision overturned, particularly in the Adelaide case. The ABF does not agree with the content, or think it is appropriate the minister intervene,\u201d one part of the email reads. The emails also confirm that the department had to pay for the removal flight in the Adelaide case, given that she made it all the way to the plane. Dutton was heading out of Australian on a flight, I believe to the Middle East, which made it a \u201ctight\u201d turnaround, to get the decision overturned with his ministerial discretion. It looks like they sent ABF officials to meet him at the airport to sign all the documents, handing it to him as he was about to board his flight. The decision made in her favour, the woman was removed or \u201coffloaded\u201d from her flight (which the department calls a removal flight) and put in one of the Adelaide airport interview rooms. But Dutton missed signing one part of the papers \u2013 the \u201cdecision instrument\u201d \u2013 which, in this case, is the big one, because it\u2019s what authorises his discretion to be used. Because they knew his intent though, they were able to take the woman from the plane and the minister signed his permission a little later (the Wednesday after) \u2013 backdating the decision \u2013 in order to \u201creflect his decision on Sunday night\u201d. Scott Morrison has announced a national drought summit: Helping our farmers and farming communities is my number one priority. Today I am announcing the next steps of my government\u2019s drought response. I will be hosting a National Drought Summit on 26 October, 2018. The coordinator general for drought, Maj Gen Stephen Day, and the special envoy for drought assistance and recovery, the hon Barnaby Joyce MP have been listening to farmers across the nation. They want coordinated action to support drought-affected families and their communities, and hosting a drought summit will unite our national efforts. The summit will put our national leaders, key people and organisations together at the same table. We will look at actions to deliver assistance, cut red tape and tackle gaps that need addressing. We\u2019re ensuring families and communities in drought-affected areas are getting what they need. We need to act and respond to the immediate issues while we are putting in place better frameworks for long-term preparedness and resilience. Peter Dutton will be standing up at 1.30 with the AFP police commissioner and the AFB commissioner to talk more about the strawberry response. We are at full flag capacity. Just hours before the Senate inquiry looking into the Peter Dutton au pair visa approvals is due to report, a whole heap of new emails on the case have dropped into the inquiry. We haven\u2019t had a chance to go through them all as yet, but it does show that in the Adelaide case, the woman made it as far as the removal flight before she was \u201coffloaded\u201d. You\u2019ll find those emails tabled, here. Brendan Nelson has started his last address to the National Press Club. At the end of the press conference, after being asked three times about the ABC story about media moguls being involved in the leadership spill, Scott Morrison had this to say: I don\u2019t believe it happened at all. And you\u2019d think I\u2019d know, given I was involved. Meanwhile, it doesn\u2019t look like the right-of-reply negotiations are going well between Roman Quaedvlieg and the powers that be: Scott Morrison on why the government is getting so tough on this: There are two parts to what we are doing. I am trying to stress very clearly the seriousness with which these types of acts of sabotage should be considered. I don\u2019t care if you have a gripe with the company, I don\u2019t care if you have a gripe with your fellow worker, this is a very serious thing which is damaging our economy, but it is affecting families. And the amount of traffic they have known, just mums and dads talking to each other because of this week is totally understandable. They need to know that there is a clear message being sent about how we see these things. And on the second point, and the new offence, which relates to recklessness and we would hope the states would look at similar measures in their own jurisdictions, if it is to have that deterrence value straight away. That people do not go and add to this problem and that they understand and they check themselves. Because if they don\u2019t check themselves, we will. Scott Morrison is announcing changes to the legislation around food contamination. The maximum penalty will increase from 10 years to 15 years \u2013 the same as you get for possessing child porn. Morrison: It is important to send a very clear message to ensure that we have the right penalties and have the right offences that are in place to ensure that we protect against these sorts of things into the future, and so yesterday I asked the attorney general to consider these matters and what we will be doing is two things when it comes to federal offences. The first one is to be increasing the penalties for those who would be found guilty under the existing provisions, from 10 years in prison to 15 years in prison. That basically takes you from someone who has an offence for forgery or theft of commonwealth property, they currently get 10 years. That\u2019s what you get 10 years for. What you get 15 years for are things like possessing child pornography and financing terrorism. That\u2019s how seriously I take this. And that\u2019s how seriously our government takes it. But the other thing we are doing is to create a new offence which deals with the offence of recklessness. Now, any idiot who thinks they can go out into a shopping centre and start sticking pins in fruit and thinks this is some sort of lark or put something on Facebook which is a hoax \u2013 that sort of behaviour is reckless and under the provision will be seeking to introduce swiftly [that] that type of behaviour would carry a penalty of up to 10 years in prison. It\u2019s not a joke. It\u2019s not funny. You are putting the livelihoods of hard-working Australians at risk. And you are scaring children and you are a coward and a grub. And if you do that sort of thing in this country, we will come after you and we will throw the book at you. The government plans on introducing the new legislation tomorrow. Anthony Albanese and Christopher Pyne had their regular spot on Adelaide radio station 5AA, and the subject of Tony Abbott versus the empty chair preselection challenge came up, and well, it doesn\u2019t sound as though Pyne is overly cut up that Abbott got a scare from a non-existent challenger: PYNE: Well these matters are for the organisation. I defeated a sitting member in pre-selection 26 years ago. That is part of the democracy of the Liberal party. It\u2019s the same in the Labor party, the same in the Greens for that matter. The truth is that everyone has to be selected before they can actually run for the seat if you are running under the flag of a political party, rather than as an independent. And that is a matter for the Liberal party branches on the northern beaches [of Sydney], and they obviously had a vote and he won the vote. In spite of the fact that there was no other candidate, they indicated some displeasure and that is a matter for the organisation on the northern beaches. That\u2019s just the fact. ALBANESE: (Laughter) HOST: (Laughter) PYNE: Why is it funny? It\u2019s just true. ALBANESE: You said that so straight, Christopher. PYNE: It\u2019s true. That\u2019s what happened. That\u2019s the process. They have a vote on, you know, whether the person should be endorsed. ALBANESE: You can have Tony Abbott or an empty chair. HOST: And the chair was coming home with a wet sail. ALBANESE: The chair, if it had gone on for another hour, the chair would have won. HOST: People were warming to the chair. Tom Connell from Sky News is reporting Ann Sudmalis has been offered the New York UN secondment trip \u2013 also known as the naughty corner. Cory Bernardi and Warren Entsch were both recent recipients at times when they were both causing issues for the government, by breaking ranks. Julia Banks was offered it and turned it down. It\u2019s three months, between September and December, to learn at the UN, and a WONDERFUL way for a political party to remove a burr in its side. No word yet on whether Sudmalis has accepted it. (Labor also gets the opportunity to send someone) Scott Morrison is holding a press conference in the blue room, which, as we know, is the second most fancy of the prime ministerial press conference locations \u2013 the first being the courtyard. Christian Porter will be joining him, so it\u2019s a minimum two-flag affair. (I believe it is on the response to the strawberry contamination crisis) After Angus Taylor\u2019s admission that the government was not planning on replacing the renewable energy target, which runs out in 2020, with anything in question time yesterday \u2013 in response to Adam Bandt\u2019s question, which, coming from the crossbench, he had in advance, meaning the answer was prepared, not a spur of the moment \u2013 Bill Shorten was asked what Labor plans on doing: We are willing to look at a market-based emissions trading scheme, but the so-called party of the free market dumped that. We were happy to look at an initial trading scheme, which made sense, but the Liberals ran away from it. Then Malcolm Turnbull and his cabinet commission to chief scientist, Alan Finkel, to do some work, and they came up with a clean energy target, and again, as constructive as we are, we said we would have a look at it, but they didn\u2019t like the chief scientist\u2019s work \u2013 and then the national energy guarantee. The current treasurer endorsed it, and now the government won\u2019t do that, so I think people are sick and tired of the climate denierlists pulling the strings, Tony Abbott and again, pulling the strings, with Scott Morrison. We are prepared to look at a national energy guarantee. The Liberal party have been \u2013 we think that\u2019s a good starting spot. You don\u2019t need to reinvent the wheel. In terms of the attack on renewables, the vacuum created by the government on energy policy is creating greater disincentives for people to invest in renewable energy. I\u2019m having a forum on the future of energy policy tomorrow here in parliament. We do think we need to provide more certainty. The single biggest driver of energy prices in Australia is a lack of policy. How can you invest in new generation if you don\u2019t know what the rules are? We are having a forum tomorrow. We will let you know how that goes. For all those wondering about the \u201cKen Wyatt was asked to join Labor\u201d story and where it is \u2013 it is because both Wyatt and Linda Burney had flat out denied it happened. Burney: A total flight of fantasy, and Ken Wyatt has been on the radio this morning saying it\u2019s exactly a flight of fantasy. He is as baffled as I am, and I cannot comment on the inside machinations of the Liberal party. When we bring you stories, even just what we are hearing when it is not attributed, we make as many attempts to verify it as possible \u2013 with the sources \u2013 and don\u2019t add fuel to the ones we can\u2019t independently verify. On the leak of the TPP minutes, Bill Shorten had this to say: First of all, let us go to the substantive issue which was being debated last week. The government has signed a trade agreement with other nations which we think has a serious deficiencies. We are concerned that this government never focuses on Australian jobs and protecting Australian jobs. So that is the debate. Right through my caucus there is concern that this agreement has plenty of problems with it. Having said that, the debate was how do we [get] some of the benefits for farmers who are going through a drought, for higher education, for our steel and metal industries, and take those benefits and correct the defects in the agreement, on the election of a Labor government, whenever that is. The other people were saying the whole agreement is rubbish and we should not do any of it. What we saw was, I thought, a thorough and fair dinkum debate. What we should never do in Australia is confuse debate and disagreement with disunity. I welcome the full range of opinions being expressed are my parliamentary team. We are in touch with everyday people. What I don\u2019t do, is confuse that with disunity. And whether the leak concerned him: I want to remind you that I myself referred to this debate on the the Insiders ... TV show, ... and said I reluctantly support this agreement and intend to improve it when we get into government. I don\u2019t begrudge journalists getting background briefings. That\u2019s your job. But seriously, let\u2019s not confuse debate and difference of opinion with disunity. I\u2019m on to my third Liberal prime minister, Tanya Plibersek is on to a new deputy ... [Liberal] leader, Chris Bowen has had three treasurers, Linda Burney has had more social services ministers then you can think of. That\u2019s disunity. Debating ideas \u2013 that\u2019s what we are paid to do. The Australian Services Union has responded to Labor\u2019s superannuation plan as a step in the right direction, but says more needs to be done. Labor\u2019s announcement that it would pay super to people on parental leave if elected to government is a long-overdue reform, advocated by the union movement for several years and will change lives. Reforms to make it easier for employers to contribute more to women\u2019s super is also positive. The fact that employers can avoid paying superannuation to those earning less than $450 in a given month is an injustice that clearly discriminates against women who dominate the casual and part-time workforce. One in every two employed women works part time compared to only one in every five men, and women are 68.6% of all part-time employees, according to official data. The ASU supports the abolition of the threshold but want to see a faster phase-in of the reform and will work with all sides of politics to achieve that. A recent survey conducted through Galaxy Research (sample of 1,068) found 76% of Australians thought that those earning under $450 per month from an employer should earn superannuation on their income. Only 16% disagree (8% said they don\u2019t know). Labor is officially launching its superannuation pay gap bridge plan. Bill Shorten, Tanya Plibersek, Chris Bowen, Clare O\u2019Neil, Linda Burney and Jenny McAllister have come together to make the announcement. Plibersek: We know that Australian women, throughout their working lives, are earning less than men. We continue to see a gender pay gap. They are also retiring with less than men. As Bill said, the gap is about $130,000 on average at the moment, about 40% less than men. There is a lot of things that we need to do over time to fix the income gap between men and women. Of course we have to address the gender pay gap during the working lives of women. But we also need to address this retirement income gap. Today\u2019s measures are a significant step towards reducing the unequal retirement incomes of men and women. Today, we are announcing, of course, that we will be paying superannuation to people who are on commonwealth paid parental leave, either maternity leave or dad and partner pay. That is a very big step. We are also progressively getting rid of the $450 per month threshold, below which superannuation currently isn\u2019t paid. We know that more and more people, instead of working one full-time job, work in multiple jobs. They are working part-time, they working cattle, doing seasonal work \u2013 quite often they are missing out on superannuation in all of those jobs. That is also contributing to the retirement income gap between men and women. These two measures combined and the other measures we are detailing today mean that over time we will reduce the gap between men and women\u2019s superannuation. It is absolutely unconscionable that today, in Australia, the fastest-growing group of people moving into homelessness are single, older women. Addressing this superannuation gap will help reduce that terrible statistic. Tanya Plibersek visited the ABC this morning to talk about Labor\u2019s superannuation plan: There\u2019s two main measures that we are talking about. The first is paying superannuation when someone\u2019s on parental leave \u2013 so maternity leave or dad and partner pay. We know that one of the big reasons that women retire with less superannuation than men is because they are taking time out of the workforce to care for their families. The second measure is another really important one. At the moment, if you earn less than $450 a month you don\u2019t get paid superannuation. And what we know is that more and more people are making up one income from lots of small jobs, part-time or casual jobs. So they are missing out on superannuation in each of those jobs. We want to make sure that we move that $450 limit over time, over the next few years. We will phase it out, so that whatever job you are working, if it\u2019s a few hours a week, you will end up getting superannuation on that job. We are also going to make it easier for employers to make voluntary contributions to women\u2019s super, if they want to do that. We will make sure that when we make changes to superannuation, we consider the gender impact of those changes. Jordon Steele-John has been leading the latest push to have abuse against the disabled included as part of the aged care royal commission. The Greens senator broke down in parliament earlier in the week while asking Mathias Cormann why it was being ignored. Last night, he used parliamentary privilege to name some of those who had died, while in care. It\u2019s horrific reading, but important: Tonight, I\u2019d like to read a passage from a speech given by my fellow disability activist and advocate Craig Wallace, who, in 2015, as part of the White Flower Memorial to commemorate all those who died in institutional and residential care, spoke to the sorrow and pain of our community. In concluding, he said, \u2018I call for those who have left us to be remembered, for their names and stories to be said out loud in the sunlight and amongst the people who love them\u2019. Tonight, I seek to speak their names, and though the sun does not shine in this place I hope that their stories will move the hearts of those who have it within their power to see justice done. The following names are those who have died in the lead-up or subsequent to the Senate inquiry which called for a royal commission. Shellay Ward, aged seven, was found locked in a room without sunlight, surrounded by faeces. Shellay died from starvation and thirst, and she weighed only nine kilograms\u2014a third of her expected body weight. She had severe autism and was considered to be profoundly disabled. Levi Bonnar, seven years old, was found beaten, tortured and finally killed by the people who were meant to care for him. Hayley Dea Bell was eight years old. When she was found in 2013 she was starved, suffering from pneumonia and her hair was infested with lice and matted with dirt. Isabella Leiper was nine. She died from a combination of internal injuries which paediatricians said were caused by blunt force to the stomach, such as a fist. Julian was 11. He was left to freeze to death in a shed. He had first been hosed with water after having faeces rubbed in his face. Liam Milne and his younger brother. Craig Sullivan, 17, who was arrested for a minor driving offence and later bashed by another inmate at the Ashley youth detention centre, died in isolation from a massive brain haemorrhage. Brandon Le Serve suffered severe learning difficulties and was killed by a family member. Jack Sullivan, 18, died in state-funded care in the ACT from drowning. Lara Madigan, 20, was returned to her parents\u2019 care at 19, despite stating that they could not look after her. Nine months before her death, authorities were warned she would die if the situation was not addressed. Two weeks before her death, both of her legs were amputated to attempt to stem infection. She died covered in her own faeces and urine in a room infested with cockroaches. Sarah Hammoud, 22, a disabled young woman who was unable to speak and reportedly half-dragged and half-carried herself from a taxi after a shocking incident, allegedly witnessed by community workers, later died in hospital in 2016 of septicaemia. Christopher O\u2019Brien, aged 22. Neil Summerell. Rebecca Lazarus was found with multiple stab wounds in her chest and abdomen in a group-care home. Jamie Vincent Johnson, age undisclosed. His care plan stated that he should not be left alone with water because he would drink it without stopping. He died after being left alone in the shower. Carney Schultz died in a group home. She had a seizure at 2.23am that was documented by staff and was found dead seven hours later. Shona Hookey, 29, died as a result of medical neglect in an institutionalised setting. Stephen Ind, 29, a quadriplegic man who made complaints of sexual assault and misconduct by his carers. He was left face down and suffocated to death. Stuart Lambert. Melanie Cutmore, who died in the same hospital and under similar circumstances as Shona Hookey. Brett Ponting, 33, died after being left unsupervised in a bathtub for an extended period of time. His carers were blamed for negligence. Darren Kingma died in his respite facility as a result of an unexplained incident in which he broke his neck. He was left on the floor for over an hour after his support workers gave up trying to pull him up, saying that he was being non-compliant. David Veech. Miriam Merten, a mother of two who was left naked and covered in faeces at a Lismore psychiatric hospital. Amanda Gilbert, 47, who had an acquired brain injury as a result of attempted suicide and was placed in the Graylands hospital psychiatric care centre in my home state of WA. She was raped and assaulted 111 times and died as a result of complications used in the medication to sedate her. The WA coroner believes this to have been an underestimation of the number of times that she was raped. Leah Elizabeth Floyd died when a pressure sore she had received at her care home became septic. The inquest heard about serious issues in the facility that she lived [in]. Julie Jacobson, a 51-year-old amputee who died a preventable, avoidable death after a private disability support provider withdrew essential supports. Sandra Deacon, 59. Janice and Robyn Frescura, 68 and 50. A family friend of the three people who died in a shooting near Hervey Bay says it was a mercy killing. Shirley Thompson. Janet Mackozdi. Julie Betty Kuhn. A 81-year-old from Armadale was charged over his elderly partner\u2019s apparent mercy killing. It was described as a beautiful act of mercy for his wife. These are the names that don\u2019t get spoken. These are the reasons. These are the human beings. These are the loved ones, the mothers, the fathers, the sons and the partners who need justice, who demand justice, whose lives were worth living, in whose memory I tonight wear a white flower and whose passing fills me with an ironclad determination. I will not stop and I will not rest until they find the justice that is so desperately owed them Speaking of the Nationals and the ABC, Catherine Marriott, who accused Barnaby Joyce of sexual harassment (which Joyce has denied) spoke to Leigh Sales for 7.30 last night. Gabrielle Chan reported on what she said, with the interview coming after the Nationals were unable to come to a finding on the allegations: Marriott did not describe the incident in detail, saying she did not want to be defined by it, but she struggled over whether to make a complaint. \u201c[After the incident] I walked up to my hotel room and I burst into tears. I then couldn\u2019t sleep that whole night. I didn\u2019t actually sleep for a week. \u201cI rang two of my closest friends and I told them what had happened, and they said they couldn\u2019t believe \u2026 they were just absolutely shocked, and they said, \u2018You can\u2019t tell anyone. You cannot tell anyone \u2026 you will be destroyed if this comes out\u2019.\u201d Bridget McKenzie spoke about the strawberry crisis \u2013 and for growers, who are facing ramifications not just this season, but next, it is absolutely a crisis \u2013 and said consumers needed to keep it in perspective: We have a great food safety system and we have been coordinating daily meetings between state and territories to keep abreast of the situation. You have seen commentary on social media, whipping up concern where maybe it is unnecessary. Earlier in the week we had three punnets contaminated out of 800,000. We need to keep it in perspective. Australians need to be assured that what they are eating is safe, but we need to put it in perspective because this has huge far-reaching implications when people stop purchasing or indeed retailers such as Coles taking all strawberries off their shelves. That has flow-on effects for businesses and thousands of Australian employees that we need to consider when people go off half-cut. The deputy Nationals leader was chatting to the ABC there. For some reason* this bill is back on the agenda \u2013 the treasury laws amendment (working holiday maker employer register) bill 2017 Basically, it would stop the tax commissioner from making a public register that backpackers could access to see if their employers comply with tax obligations. As a general rule, those who are transparent tend to be less exploitive employers. The register was part of the backpacker tax legislation, which was passed in 2016. (Doesn\u2019t that feel like a lifetime ago?) The bill to remove the register popped up in February last year, and then last hit the Senate in May. It went away, but now is back. And all of a sudden \u2013 it didn\u2019t hit the agenda until late yesterday. Labor\u2019s Andrew Leigh is against it: We\u2019ve heard too many reports about the exploitation of vulnerable working-holiday makers and that\u2019s why Labor was pleased when the Libs committed to a public register of those employers that have employed working-holiday makers. Now they\u2019re trying to go back on that. There [is] backing in the Senate a bill that would kill off the public register. Less transparency means more exploitation and it means Australians are less likely to see the taxes paid that ought to be paid. The Senate should vote down this bad bill. We need more transparency, stronger protection for working-holiday makers and better compliance with Australia\u2019s tax laws. * The reason is the government has run out of legislation after taking the Neg and company tax cuts off the table, and is yet to start working out what its policies are under Scott Morrison, creating a lag in legislation. And while the world watches the latest Korean summit, where Moon Jae-in and Kim Jong-un are holding their third meeting in an attempt to officially end the Korean war, ending nuclear weapons also has a local focus: From the office of foreign minister, Marise Payne: The Australian government condemns in the strongest terms the atrocities committed in Myanmar\u2019s Rakhine, Shan and Kachin states, as detailed in the full report of the UN fact-finding mission on Myanmar. Following the mission\u2019s preliminary report of 27 August, the full report documents in detail serious violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law, committed primarily by Myanmar\u2019s military against ethnic minorities. In the case of Rakhine state, the fact-finding mission concludes that crimes against humanity and war crimes have occurred, as well as finding sufficient evidence to warrant an investigation and prosecutions for genocide perpetrated against the Rohingya. The full report of the fact-finding mission adds to a large body of evidence indicating the commission of the most serious crimes under international law, particularly against the Rohingya. The Australian government is considering options in response to the fact-finding mission\u2019s report, including targeted sanctions. In line with the mission\u2019s recommendations, Australia will support new international efforts on accountability and justice in Myanmar, including at the human rights council, of which we are a member. Myanmar continues to face formidable challenges as it transitions from five decades of military rule. As a regional partner, Australia will continue to support efforts to achieve democracy and national peace and reconciliation for the benefit of all of people in Myanmar. Respect for human rights, and full accountability for the human rights violations that have occurred, will be essential to this process. The future of work report is also due to be tabled at around 5pm - keep an eye out for that one as well, because I know it has caused some Senators some sleepless nights. In addressing the leak, Chris Bowen said there are real-world examples of where deals had been changed after the fact: We had a good and constructive debate in caucus. You would expect us to do, as a serious political party. The caucus accepted the recommendation from Jason Clare, with my strong support, to facilitate the legislation. That\u2019s not to say we think it\u2019s a perfect deal. That\u2019s not to say there aren\u2019t things we would move to improve in government, of course. But we are a trading nation. One in five jobs in Australia depends on trade. The important and responsible thing for the Labor party to do, as [New Zealand\u2019s prime minister] Jacinda Ardern has done and as [Canada\u2019s prime minister] Justin Trudeau has done, for example, is to facilitate the TPP. We will have improvements to make in negotiations with countries as Jacinda Ardern has done. I mean, when she came to office she\u2019s negotiated changes to the ISDS [investor-state dispute settlement] regime, for example. Jason Clare has put together an excellent policy which was endorsed by the caucus. You would expect that we would have a good and proper respectful debate about the policy, as we did. The fallout from the strawberry sabotage is continuing. This is just absolutely heartbreaking, given the drought and storms that have already affected so many growers. Queensland, which was ground zero for the crisis, has announced a package to attempt to keep the industry afloat in the face of growers having to dump their stock, and has called on the federal government to follow suit. The bells are ringing \u2013 parliament is about to begin. The governor general address-in-reply debate is listed as fourth \u2013 if the Senate gets to it, you know they have officially run out of stuff to do. Rob Harris and James Campbell were handed minutes from a Labor meeting on the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal, the support of which has become Labor policy, by a very, very slim margin. That very, very slim margin has created some consternation \u2013 so much so, that Bill Shorten has suffered his first major show of public dissent in some time \u2013 with the leaking of the meeting minutes. From the Herald Sun report: Former ACTU president Ged Kearney, the Member for Batman in Victoria, dismissed the TPP\u2019s provisions to protect workers as \u201cweak and aspirational at best\u201d. Josh Wilson, the Member for Fremantle in Western Australia, told caucus: \u201cWe have known the serious shortcomings of the TPP for some time\u201d and warned that in the past \u201cthe Coalition has used trade agreements to advance their deregulation agenda\u201d. And WA senator Glenn Sterle raised the spectre of the deal being used to create low-tax, low-wage areas, asking: \u201cHow do I go back to WA and say this won\u2019t impact Gina Rinehart setting up a special economic zone?\u201d Doug Cameron also said it would prove negative for them in western Sydney and Queensland. Chris Bowen and Labor are not denying there is dissent \u2013 everyone asked has admitted there have been some \u201cspirited\u201d discussions. The line in response has been \u2013 we\u2019ll fix it, if we win power. But that doesn\u2019t seem good enough for quite a lot of MPs, who have indicated they will continue to fight the decision internally. In other news, the Peter Dutton Senate inquiry report is due today \u2013 we are expecting it around 5pm. Anne Aly was asked about the timing of Labor\u2019s announcement when she stopped by doors* this morning: Let me start by saying the Coalition doesn\u2019t have a problem with women, the Coalition has a problem with men. I think it comes at a time when we\u2019re starting to talk about older people, older Australians, and it\u2019s particularly a pertinent time to shine the spotlight on how women in particular fare worse off in their later years. Particularly because of the fact that they are behind in superannuation, 30% of older women are likely to live in poverty, and I think it\u2019s time we really addressed this issue and addressed this inequality. It\u2019s a very stark inequality. And we can start by making some measures to address that, and Labor has taken that on, we\u2019ve recognised it, and we\u2019ve started to do something about it. *Doors is what we call the short doorstop interviews. MPs only come by when they have something to say. Labor has beaten the government to filling the policy void, announcing a superannuation plan that would see women on maternity leave, and on low pay, paid super in a bid to bridge the superannuation pay gap. The gap in retirement savings is often raised as part of the pay equality issue, with several reports finding that women are penalised in retirement for taking time out to have a baby, or because they work in industries that are traditionally paid less. On average, it works out to about $113,000 less in superannuation, or 40% less. Labor has pledged to continue super payments for anyone on paid parental leave, dad and partner pay, as well as phase out the $450 minimum monthly income threshold for the super guarantee. Any future changes to superannuation would also have to include a published impact to women. The timing of the announcement is no coincidence. The Liberal party is still struggling to come up with an answer to the lack of women in its ranks, as well as how to deal with allegations of bullying, which have been levelled by some of its female MPs. But it is not all smooth sailing for Labor \u2013 Rob Harris from the Herald Sun has published sections of leaked meeting minutes, revealing the extent of unrest within caucus over the decision to support the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Labor has given its support to the trade deal, with the caveat it will amend parts of the labour deal if it wins government. But those in the left, who have stood against the deal, remain sceptical and concerned. It was raised in the caucus meeting again yesterday, with MPs attempting to overturn the decision. That was narrowly defeated, but doesn\u2019t look like going anywhere soon. We\u2019ll bring you all of that and more as the day rolls on. Mike Bowers is off today, so it\u2019s just me and the Guardian brains trust, and we\u2019ll do our best to fill the gap. I have managed two coffees today so far, so this should be interesting? Ready? Let\u2019s get into it!",

Because unlike their large rivals who have spent the past two years failing upwards, or at least onwards, the Lib Dems cannot afford to mess up. When they make a mistake, it sticks. They only fail downwards.</p> <p>This has been their story for some time. They are hopeless, like all parties at the moment: only with them it actually matters. When Nick Clegg messed up his party\u2019s opportunity in government, he toxified it for years \u2013 it is possibly still toxified. (Last year, while sounding out possible voters in the run-up to the general election, a Lib Dem MP hopeful told me anyone who mentioned tuition fees on the doorstep was immediately marked as a \u201cno\u201d, whatever their voting history.)</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/07/lib-dems-plan-to-let-supporters-choose-leader-without-joining-fee\">Lib Dems plan to let supporters choose leader without joining fee</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Those 2017 elections were another opportunity, but they messed them up, too. They did not seize the chance to represent the 16 million remain voters abandoned by the two main parties (Tony Blair, remember, achieved his landslide with 13.5m votes, Cameron won in 2015 with 11.3m), which could have gained them unexpected victories all over the map. Instead, they took refuge in their old battlegrounds, targeting leave-voting constituencies in the south-west, and in the process watering down their message on Brexit. Voters almost wiped the party off the map altogether and the Lib Dems have not regained much political ground since.</p> <p>They have an opportunity now. There is a great deal of anti-Brexit feeling in the country (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/aug/11/more-than-100-pro-leave-constituencies-switch-to-remain\" title=\"\">some 100 constituencies</a> have switched from leave to remain since the referendum), and support is building for a \u201cPeople\u2019s Vote\u201d on the final deal. In August a <a href=\"http://uk.businessinsider.com/yougov-poll-peoples-vote-second-referendum-brexit-fears-grow-over-a-no-deal-brexit-2018-8\" title=\"\">YouGov poll</a> found 45% want such a vote, while 35% do not. On Saturday, another YouGov poll showed a startling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/08/unions-poll-massive-backing-second-eu-brexit-referendum\" title=\"\">two-to-one backing</a> for a People\u2019s Vote among members of Britain\u2019s three biggest trade unions.</p> <p>There is also evidence that a robustly anti-Brexit party could be carried upwards. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/aug/19/labour-finished-if-it-backs-brexit-in-a-snap-election-says-adonis\" title=\"\">Two weeks ago, a poll</a> commissioned by Best for Britain and Hope not Hate showed Labour\u2019s support would improve dramatically should it strongly oppose Brexit. At present, the Lib Dems are the most prominent party to do so.</p> <p>In this context, part of Vince Cable\u2019s plan sounds promising. He wants to build a \u201cmomentum of moderates\u201d by allowing anyone to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/07/lib-dems-plan-to-let-supporters-choose-leader-without-joining-fee\" title=\"\">join the party for free</a>. Members would then be able to vote in a leader of their choice, who would no longer have to be an MP.

          "bodyText": "How on earth did they mess this one up? This will go on the Lib Dems\u2019 gravestone when they die \u2013 an event which is, let\u2019s be honest, not beyond the realms of possibility. Because unlike their large rivals who have spent the past two years failing upwards, or at least onwards, the Lib Dems cannot afford to mess up. When they make a mistake, it sticks. They only fail downwards. This has been their story for some time. They are hopeless, like all parties at the moment: only with them it actually matters. When Nick Clegg messed up his party\u2019s opportunity in government, he toxified it for years \u2013 it is possibly still toxified. (Last year, while sounding out possible voters in the run-up to the general election, a Lib Dem MP hopeful told me anyone who mentioned tuition fees on the doorstep was immediately marked as a \u201cno\u201d, whatever their voting history.) Those 2017 elections were another opportunity, but they messed them up, too. They did not seize the chance to represent the 16 million remain voters abandoned by the two main parties (Tony Blair, remember, achieved his landslide with 13.5m votes, Cameron won in 2015 with 11.3m), which could have gained them unexpected victories all over the map. Instead, they took refuge in their old battlegrounds, targeting leave-voting constituencies in the south-west, and in the process watering down their message on Brexit. Voters almost wiped the party off the map altogether and the Lib Dems have not regained much political ground since. They have an opportunity now. There is a great deal of anti-Brexit feeling in the country (some 100 constituencies have switched from leave to remain since the referendum), and support is building for a \u201cPeople\u2019s Vote\u201d on the final deal. In August a YouGov poll found 45% want such a vote, while 35% do not. On Saturday, another YouGov poll showed a startling two-to-one backing for a People\u2019s Vote among members of Britain\u2019s three biggest trade unions. There is also evidence that a robustly anti-Brexit party could be carried upwards. Two weeks ago, a poll commissioned by Best for Britain and Hope not Hate showed Labour\u2019s support would improve dramatically should it strongly oppose Brexit. At present, the Lib Dems are the most prominent party to do so. In this context, part of Vince Cable\u2019s plan sounds promising. He wants to build a \u201cmomentum of moderates\u201d by allowing anyone to join the party for free. Members would then be able to vote in a leader of their choice, who would no longer have to be an MP. Some have ridiculed the idea, dubbing it \u201cslowmentum\u201d, but this sort of thing has worked elsewhere. In Canada, it helped Justin Trudeau to power; in France, it did the same for Emmanuel Macron. One can imagine a pro-People\u2019s Vote movement catching fire in Britain in the lead-up to the Brexit deal \u2013 finally, a home for those troubled by the doom-laden predictions, those panicked as their companies falter, those who felt cheated by the lies of the leave campaign.

          "body": "<p>There are several mysteries in British politics at the moment. Here is one that Sherlock Holmes would call a three-pipe problem: why are the Lib&#xa0;Dems doing so atrociously?</p> <p>On the face of it, the weather is set fair for a classic third-party revival. The Tories and Labour are both fighting civil wars. The Conservatives are riven by vicious infighting over Brexit; Labour\u2019s angry summer has been devoured by a shameful battle about antisemitism. The two leaders of the major parties are not liked by most of their own MPs. Many voters who self-identify as Labour or Tory say they are dissatisfied with those parties. When asked to choose between Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn as the best candidate for Number 10, <a href=\"http://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/qmsh3r04sv/YG%20Trackers%20-%20Best%20Prime%20Minister.pdf\" title=\"\">the most popular choice is Neither</a>. More than half of voters say that <a href=\"http://natcen.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">no party represents their views</a>. A very substantial chunk of the electorate has no affinity with the ugly fanaticism of either Corbynite zealots or the Brextremists. That ought to leave many empty hectares of prime political real estate available to be snapped up and built on.</p> <p>Yet Britain\u2019s traditional party of the middle ground is flatlining. The Liberal Democrats are polling in poor single digits, perilously close to the point where their rating is indistinguishable from the margin of error. They put on more council seats than any other party in the local elections in May and have attracted more members since Brexit, but it is the national ratings that get the attention. Rightly so, when the Lib Dems still claim to have aspirations to be back in government one day. These ratings are dreadful in themselves and even worse in the context of simultaneous crises afflicting both the larger parties.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/07/new-political-party-break-mould-westminster-uk-brexit\">New centrist party gets \u00a350m backing to \u2018break mould\u2019 of UK politics</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This miserable showing has generated a growing rumble about the leadership of Sir Vince Cable. This threatened to be the main narrative when the party conference kicks off in Brighton next weekend. In so much as the media was going to pay that gathering any attention at all, a lot of journalists would be in attendance only to spend their time trawling the seafront for Lib Dem activists ready to tell their ballroom-dancing leader that he ought to foxtrot off.</p> <p>Sir Vince was trying to preempt that becoming the story of his conference when, on Friday, he told them not to bother discussing his retirement because he had already decided on it: he will be quitting before the next election unless one should happen in the near future. Though he did not offer a precise timeline for his departure, he said he would stand down once Brexit was \u201cstopped or resolved\u201d. This gives him some wriggle-room to stretch out his swansong. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/07/vince-cable-step-down-lib-dem-leader-brexit-resolved-stopped\" title=\"\">\u201cOnce Brexit is resolved\u201d</a> is a rather elastic formula. But it doesn\u2019t sound compatible with leading the Lib Dems any further than 2020 and most of his colleagues expect him to be gone some time in 2019.</p> <p>This is a recognition that the task of reviving the Lib Dems has proved to be more demanding than he anticipated. This time last year, when political editor Toby Helm and I interviewed him on the eve of his conference, Sir Vince was suffused with so much optimism (or delusion) that he said he did not think it impossible that he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/16/vince-cable-interview-lib-dem-revival-potential-prime-minister\" title=\"\">could become prime minister</a>. He\u2019s since had a year to realise that this isn\u2019t going to happen.</p> <p>With Sir Vince\u2019s future (more or less) settled, that leaves us with a much larger question of interest to anyone despairing of the current party alignments. Why have the Lib Dems singularly failed to capitalise on what look like highly propitious circumstances for them?</p> <p>One possible explanation is that they are still toxified by their five years in coalition with the Conservatives. This is an obvious explainer, but now an outdated one. The coalition seems very long ago. Pre-Brexit, pre-Corbyn, pre-Trump, the coalition government of David Thingy has the cobwebbed feel of another epoch. Any lingering memories of those years are surely being effaced by the dysfunctionality of the current government and its Labour opposition.</p> <p>A better explanation for why the Lib Dems are struggling so badly is that they simply lack heft. The third party always has to fight to get a word in edgeways. That handicap is compounded when the voice has become enfeebled. Two bad general elections have left the Lib Dems with just a dozen MPs. Of them, Sir Vince himself is the only one with much national name recognition. There comes a point when a party falls so low in its parliamentary representation, which is then reflected in scant media attention and voter interest, that it just doesn\u2019t&#xa0;get taken very seriously. That is the view of more than one former Lib Dem&#xa0;leader to whom I\u2019ve spoken.</p> <p>Then there is the starkness of the divide between the two main parties as Corbynism tightens its grip on Labour and Rees-Moggery becomes rampant in the Tory party. It may be wrong to think that this polarisation ought to make it easier for the Lib Dems to revive as a voice of moderation. It may actually be making it harder to do this. Our electoral system imposes a forced choice on many voters. They feel compelled to pick between the horribly unappetising and the absolutely unacceptable. Imagine you are a voter who is utterly repelled by the Tories, but who also thinks that a Corbyn premiership would be a calamity for Britain. If your top priority is stopping the Labour leader from getting to Number 10, you would probably put aside the Lib Dems as an option on the grounds that the only reliable way to prevent a Corbyn premiership is to hold your nose and back the Tories. It works the other way around. Imagine you are a voter who loathes Labour\u2019s current leadership, but who also thinks the Tories are a disaster for Britain. Again, even if you rather warm to the Lib Dems and really don\u2019t fancy Labour, you might well end up casting for Labour as the best way to block the Tories. This would explain why the combined vote share of the top two parties was so high at the last election, even when so many voters expressed dissatisfaction with both of them.</p> <p>The only answer to this conundrum is for a third force to look like a serious alternative to making the devil\u2019s choice. The Lib Dems seem to know that they are too weak to achieve this on their own. Witness how they talk about the prospect of a new party emerging from a breakaway of Labour moderates, possibly combined with a breakaway from the Tories by some Conservative MPs. The Lib Dems have not poured scorn on the notion of a fresh, broadly centrist formation, even though it would be a competitor in their political space. Sir Vince and other senior Lib Dems have actively encouraged the idea. He says openly that he has been talking to disenchanted Labour and Tory MPs about the possibility of something new emerging.</p> <p>His other idea is to reach out to moderate voters who are not currently engaged by his party or any other.

          "bodyText": "There are several mysteries in British politics at the moment. Here is one that Sherlock Holmes would call a three-pipe problem: why are the Lib Dems doing so atrociously? On the face of it, the weather is set fair for a classic third-party revival. The Tories and Labour are both fighting civil wars. The Conservatives are riven by vicious infighting over Brexit; Labour\u2019s angry summer has been devoured by a shameful battle about antisemitism. The two leaders of the major parties are not liked by most of their own MPs. Many voters who self-identify as Labour or Tory say they are dissatisfied with those parties. When asked to choose between Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn as the best candidate for Number 10, the most popular choice is Neither. More than half of voters say that no party represents their views. A very substantial chunk of the electorate has no affinity with the ugly fanaticism of either Corbynite zealots or the Brextremists. That ought to leave many empty hectares of prime political real estate available to be snapped up and built on. Yet Britain\u2019s traditional party of the middle ground is flatlining. The Liberal Democrats are polling in poor single digits, perilously close to the point where their rating is indistinguishable from the margin of error. They put on more council seats than any other party in the local elections in May and have attracted more members since Brexit, but it is the national ratings that get the attention. Rightly so, when the Lib Dems still claim to have aspirations to be back in government one day. These ratings are dreadful in themselves and even worse in the context of simultaneous crises afflicting both the larger parties. This miserable showing has generated a growing rumble about the leadership of Sir Vince Cable. This threatened to be the main narrative when the party conference kicks off in Brighton next weekend. In so much as the media was going to pay that gathering any attention at all, a lot of journalists would be in attendance only to spend their time trawling the seafront for Lib Dem activists ready to tell their ballroom-dancing leader that he ought to foxtrot off. Sir Vince was trying to preempt that becoming the story of his conference when, on Friday, he told them not to bother discussing his retirement because he had already decided on it: he will be quitting before the next election unless one should happen in the near future. Though he did not offer a precise timeline for his departure, he said he would stand down once Brexit was \u201cstopped or resolved\u201d. This gives him some wriggle-room to stretch out his swansong. \u201cOnce Brexit is resolved\u201d is a rather elastic formula. But it doesn\u2019t sound compatible with leading the Lib Dems any further than 2020 and most of his colleagues expect him to be gone some time in 2019. This is a recognition that the task of reviving the Lib Dems has proved to be more demanding than he anticipated. This time last year, when political editor Toby Helm and I interviewed him on the eve of his conference, Sir Vince was suffused with so much optimism (or delusion) that he said he did not think it impossible that he could become prime minister. He\u2019s since had a year to realise that this isn\u2019t going to happen. With Sir Vince\u2019s future (more or less) settled, that leaves us with a much larger question of interest to anyone despairing of the current party alignments.
