That puppy, Otis, didn\u2019t make it to see Warren\u2019s presidential bid, having died in 2012. But Warren, ever the woman with a plan, wasn\u2019t going to let that stop her. She replaced Otis last year with another golden retriever, this time named Bailey.</p> <h2>Joe Biden</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"539d9bed6f9046ccabd2d9af95762b9218befe3a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/539d9bed6f9046ccabd2d9af95762b9218befe3a/0_73_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\".\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Joe Biden has two dogs, and like any guy trying to rebuild the soul of the nation, he rescued them both. Biden\u2019s dogs are German shepherds named Champ and Major \u2013 although he probably would have called them \u201cMan\u201d and \u201cFolks\u201d, if they were more acceptable dog names.</p> <h2>Mike Pence</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BzgEdPDhOs_/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

          "bodyText": "On Tuesday, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez brought joy to the world in the form of a video announcing a new addition to her family: a dog. The dog appears to be a French bulldog, an intelligent dog known for its stubborn streak. That\u2019s perhaps an obvious fit for the freshman congresswoman, who ousted a 10-term incumbent without any lobbyist cash (although it is worth noting that concerns have been raised around this breed, as some have trouble breathing). As legend has it, a dog says a lot about its owner. That saying surely holds even more relevance when it comes to politicians. Second only to babies, pets are a choice weapon for politicians who want to soften their image. Their canine best friend holds a special role: to project the image that the politician wants the public to have of them. Here is our take on what the following dogs say about their political owners. Pete Buttigieg Mayor Pete wants you to know his dog is a fighter. Part pug, part beagle, his dog Buddy only has one eye and looks somewhat menacing. Which is just as well, considering Buttigieg\u2019s attempts at convincing us of his fighting credentials haven\u2019t exactly paid off. Buttigieg has mentioned his time in the military hundreds of times during his campaign trail, describing it as \u201cdangerous\u201d, and bragging about time he spent \u201coutside the wire\u201d. Alas, documents seem to suggest that Buttigieg didn\u2019t spend any time in direct combat during his time in the army. But the dog still looks tough. Boris Johnson Boris Johnson\u2019s dog is a Jack Russell with floppy blond hair. They say a Jack Russell is a small dog with a big attitude, which is fitting for a prime minister who wrote a back-up newspaper column arguing that the UK should stay in the EU, then campaigned to leave, pushed for a hard Brexit and asked everyone if they still wanted to be mates after. Justin Trudeau The Canadian prime minister has many things going for him. He recently got a beard, when he roasts Donald Trump alongside world leaders they all laugh, and he has a cute dog. No wonder Melania kissed him. Elizabeth Warren When Elizabeth Warren was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, her students surprised her one day with a golden retriever puppy. That puppy, Otis, didn\u2019t make it to see Warren\u2019s presidential bid, having died in 2012. But Warren, ever the woman with a plan, wasn\u2019t going to let that stop her. She replaced Otis last year with another golden retriever, this time named Bailey. Joe Biden Joe Biden has two dogs, and like any guy trying to rebuild the soul of the nation, he rescued them both. Biden\u2019s dogs are German shepherds named Champ and Major \u2013 although he probably would have called them \u201cMan\u201d and \u201cFolks\u201d, if they were more acceptable dog names. Mike Pence We are aware that Marlon Bundo is a rabbit, not a dog. Mike Pence also has a dog, but that seemed far less interesting than Bundo, who has its own Wikipedia page. Bundo is colloquially known as Botus \u2013 or Bunny of the United States. He has been described as the \u201conly positive thing in Washington\u201d.",

In my eyes, that made him a Remain hero, someone who stood for truth and decency. All this was shattered when Maugham <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JolyonMaugham/status/1210110735189233665\" title=\"\">tweeted</a>: \u201cAlready this morning I have killed a fox with a baseball bat. How\u2019s your Boxing Day going?\u201d He said he\u2019d worn his wife\u2019s \u201ctoo small green kimono\u201d to kill the fox (which got trapped in netting while trying to get at the chickens he kept in his central London garden), \u201cafterwards, nursing my hangover with a coffee\u201d.</p> <p>Were these meant to be amusing or humanising details? As criticism grew, he amended his attitude to be more reflective and contrite. Too little, too late. This was, at best, misguided liberal machismo in action.</p> <p>Maugham contacted the RSPCA himself and the incident is being investigated. Of course, Leave-supporting news outlets loved it, but that doesn\u2019t alter the fact that Maugham battered a trapped, helpless animal to death. While <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/22/they-deserve-care-and-compassion-sanctuary-says-foxes-misunderstood\" title=\"\">foxes are not a protected species</a>, anyone viewing them as expendable vermin should be aware that this is one of the prime arguments used by foxhunters. Though urban foxes can be huge, they don\u2019t tend to approach humans so there\u2019s little reason to fear them. If Maugham was concerned for his chickens, couldn\u2019t he have just removed <em>them</em>, letting the RSPCA humanely deal with the fox? Keeping chickens in your garden is arguably the kind of affectation that makes people hate the \u201cmetropolitan elite\u201d but, if people wish to do so, they should at least make their enclosures fox-proof.</p> <p>Worse, Maugham initially seemed proud of his actions \u2013 otherwise, why announce it on Twitter? It came across as alpha-liberal posturing: \u201cLook everybody, I\u2019m not your average neutered city dweeb. I just killed something.\u201d Maugham went on to justify his actions by saying he\u2019d previously shot and butchered rabbits: \u201cAlthough I don\u2019t enjoy killing things, it does come with the territory if you\u2019re a meat eater.\u201d</p> <p>Oh, spare me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes before at the posturing \u201cred in tooth and claw\u201d bores, usually men trying to get their Tarzan-mojo back by killing animals, pompously claiming it\u2019s the \u201conly honest\u201d way, while doubtless still getting 99% of their meat from the Ocado delivery. While this approach beats the horrors of abattoirs, it\u2019s hardly cruelty-free, non-professionals really shouldn\u2019t kill anything and those who farm organically don\u2019t tend to brag about slaughtering animals on social media.</p> <p>Maybe I\u2019m oversensitive, but I fail to see any justification for bludgeoning to death a trapped animal. It wasn\u2019t done for food or for protection, so\u2026 what exactly? Attention? Aggressive masculinity? Bragging rights? All attitudes and behaviour some of us are heartily sick of seeing from people whose core values we don\u2019t share.</p> <h2>Should I rejoin Labour to vote for a new leader?

I, for one, balked at the idea of abandoning the Liberal Democrats; as much as they had a bad election, they stuck to their clear anti-Brexit message, finally laying to rest all that \u201cFib Dem\u201d baloney. However, it\u2019s been galling to watch Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings preen as master electoral strategists. (What was your strategy, again, guys: \u201cNot being Jeremy Corbyn? The End\u201d?) This could be a chance to get the Labour party back on track, especially as the Corbynites still seem to be hanging around like dangerous gas leaks.</p> <p>Those who are determined to continue the disastrous Corbynite project shouldn\u2019t be allowed to have everything their own way in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/23/labour-leadership-contest-whos-in-and-who-could-join-them\" title=\"\">leadership contest</a>. I\u2019m also enraged by the blatant attempts to nobble <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/17/keir-starmer-labour-leadership-pitch-radical-government\" title=\"\">Keir Starmer</a> by pushing the narrative that \u201cthe next leader should be a woman\u201d. While there are female contenders I\u2019d love to see become leader \u2013 I voted for Yvette Cooper when she stood against Corbyn \u2013 it\u2019s a disgrace to use self-serving faux-feminism to rig the contest even more in Rebecca Long Bailey\u2019s favour.</p> <p>If Labour chooses another Corbynite, they\u2019re probably finished for good \u2013 they\u2019d have to rebrand as some kind of quaint political pop-up or bien-pensant book club. Put like that, having a say in the Labour leadership election seems to be a good idea; you will need to do it soon to qualify for a vote.

          "bodyText": "What possessed prominent Remainer lawyer Jolyon Maugham QC to club a fox to death with a baseball bat and then announce it on Twitter? Along with Gina Miller, Maugham launched myriad legal challenges to Brexit under the Good Law Project. In my eyes, that made him a Remain hero, someone who stood for truth and decency. All this was shattered when Maugham tweeted: \u201cAlready this morning I have killed a fox with a baseball bat. How\u2019s your Boxing Day going?\u201d He said he\u2019d worn his wife\u2019s \u201ctoo small green kimono\u201d to kill the fox (which got trapped in netting while trying to get at the chickens he kept in his central London garden), \u201cafterwards, nursing my hangover with a coffee\u201d. Were these meant to be amusing or humanising details? As criticism grew, he amended his attitude to be more reflective and contrite. Too little, too late. This was, at best, misguided liberal machismo in action. Maugham contacted the RSPCA himself and the incident is being investigated. Of course, Leave-supporting news outlets loved it, but that doesn\u2019t alter the fact that Maugham battered a trapped, helpless animal to death. While foxes are not a protected species, anyone viewing them as expendable vermin should be aware that this is one of the prime arguments used by foxhunters. Though urban foxes can be huge, they don\u2019t tend to approach humans so there\u2019s little reason to fear them. If Maugham was concerned for his chickens, couldn\u2019t he have just removed them, letting the RSPCA humanely deal with the fox? Keeping chickens in your garden is arguably the kind of affectation that makes people hate the \u201cmetropolitan elite\u201d but, if people wish to do so, they should at least make their enclosures fox-proof. Worse, Maugham initially seemed proud of his actions \u2013 otherwise, why announce it on Twitter? It came across as alpha-liberal posturing: \u201cLook everybody, I\u2019m not your average neutered city dweeb. I just killed something.\u201d Maugham went on to justify his actions by saying he\u2019d previously shot and butchered rabbits: \u201cAlthough I don\u2019t enjoy killing things, it does come with the territory if you\u2019re a meat eater.\u201d Oh, spare me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes before at the posturing \u201cred in tooth and claw\u201d bores, usually men trying to get their Tarzan-mojo back by killing animals, pompously claiming it\u2019s the \u201conly honest\u201d way, while doubtless still getting 99% of their meat from the Ocado delivery. While this approach beats the horrors of abattoirs, it\u2019s hardly cruelty-free, non-professionals really shouldn\u2019t kill anything and those who farm organically don\u2019t tend to brag about slaughtering animals on social media. Maybe I\u2019m oversensitive, but I fail to see any justification for bludgeoning to death a trapped animal. It wasn\u2019t done for food or for protection, so\u2026 what exactly? Attention? Aggressive masculinity? Bragging rights? All attitudes and behaviour some of us are heartily sick of seeing from people whose core values we don\u2019t share. Should I rejoin Labour to vote for a new leader? Tricky... Since the election result (or, as I call it, the Flattening), can centrists like myself even be bothered to rejoin the Labour party for the leadership contest? I, for one, balked at the idea of abandoning the Liberal Democrats; as much as they had a bad election, they stuck to their clear anti-Brexit message, finally laying to rest all that \u201cFib Dem\u201d baloney. However, it\u2019s been galling to watch Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings preen as master electoral strategists. (What was your strategy, again, guys: \u201cNot being Jeremy Corbyn? The End\u201d?) This could be a chance to get the Labour party back on track, especially as the Corbynites still seem to be hanging around like dangerous gas leaks. Those who are determined to continue the disastrous Corbynite project shouldn\u2019t be allowed to have everything their own way in the leadership contest. I\u2019m also enraged by the blatant attempts to nobble Keir Starmer by pushing the narrative that \u201cthe next leader should be a woman\u201d. While there are female contenders I\u2019d love to see become leader \u2013 I voted for Yvette Cooper when she stood against Corbyn \u2013 it\u2019s a disgrace to use self-serving faux-feminism to rig the contest even more in Rebecca Long Bailey\u2019s favour. If Labour chooses another Corbynite, they\u2019re probably finished for good \u2013 they\u2019d have to rebrand as some kind of quaint political pop-up or bien-pensant book club. Put like that, having a say in the Labour leadership election seems to be a good idea; you will need to do it soon to qualify for a vote. Yet even thinking about it is to feel engulfed by ennui \u2013 not to mention deja vu. To rejoin or not to rejoin the Labour party, that is the centrist question. Let\u2019s hope that all the people who left Labour in despair aren\u2019t too demoralised to consider it. Trump on the cutting-room floor? What a wasted chance Why did the Canadian Broadcasting Company (CBC) cut Donald Trump\u2019s cameo from its screening of the 1992 film, Home Alone 2? CBC says that it was removed for an ad break in 2014, before Trump became president. Nevertheless, Trump took to Twitter to accuse the Canadian prime minister of being behind the axing of the scene: \u201cI guess Justin [Trudeau] doesn\u2019t much like my making him pay up on Nato on Trade!\u201d Yeah, that would be it \u2013 political revenge via the medium of a light entertainment franchise. Trudeau, consider yourself owned. Seriously, I wish CBC hadn\u2019t cut Trump\u2019s scene. It should have left it in to illustrate what a desperate fame-whore he\u2019s always been. Over the years, Trump has appeared in highly forgettable cameos in multiple films (including Zoolander, Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps and Ghosts Can\u2019t Do It). Moreover, when I used to watch Trump host the US Celebrity Apprentice, it was notable how he\u2019d practically drool over the stars. It was mortifying (and revealing) how slavishly he respected and craved even moderate celebrity status. So, while one appreciates that Canadians have a right to Trump-free viewing, it was a shame to lose the cameo, if only to make the point: America, here\u2019s your president-in-waiting \u2013 a repeat-offender starfucker meriting barely five seconds of screentime. \u2022 Barbara Ellen is an Observer columnist",

          "body": "<p>A year of high anxiety was rendered more alarming by intensifying clashes of interest between world powers. As international cooperation declined, and nationalist agendas gathered strength, China, the US, Russia and Europe, and their respective allies, emulators and proxies, engaged in often dangerous competition.</p> <p>The Chinese communist regime\u2019s increasingly assertive behaviour at home and abroad, reflecting the authoritarian outlook of its paramount leader-for-life, Xi Jinping, produced head-on collisions with western countries, notably over Hong Kong, trade, technology and the repression of the Uighur Muslim minority in Xinjiang.</p> <p>When the US and Britain objected to the abusive treatment of pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong, they were told to mind their own business.

China claimed to be fighting Islamist terrorism.</p> <p>Xi also attracted strong criticism over his signature <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/ng-interactive/2018/jul/30/what-china-belt-road-initiative-silk-road-explainer\" title=\"\">Belt </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/ng-interactive/2018/jul/30/what-china-belt-road-initiative-silk-road-explainer\" title=\"\">and Road</a> global investment and infrastructure initiative, which Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, called a debt trap for the unwary.

China retaliated in kind even as national economic growth slowed. The result was increased market volatility, bad blood and fears of another global economic crash.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s confrontational and chaotic policies caused problems around the world. After prematurely boasting he had eliminated the North Korean nuclear threat, he failed to nail down a substantive agreement. The latter half of the year saw <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/01/north-korea-hails-test-of-super-large-multiple-rocket-launcher\" title=\"\">renewed weapons tests</a> by Kim Jong-un\u2019s regime, which set a 31 December deadline for progress.</p> <h2><strong>Chaos reigns in the Middle East</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1ec7230d8795759595bf330539e362cc8088ee89\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ec7230d8795759595bf330539e362cc8088ee89/0_53_3333_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A member of the Syrian Civil Defence, also known as the White Helmets, carries a wounded girl after a reported Russian air strike in Idlib province\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A member of the Syrian Civil Defence, also known as the White Helmets, carries a girl after a reported Russian air strike in Idlib province.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Omar Haj Kadour/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the Middle East, confusion reigned as Trump pushed Iran to the brink of war, then pulled back. With damaging US economic and financial sanctions, plus a global oil embargo still in place, and with Iran experiencing unprecedented levels of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/01/iran-fuel-protest-crackdowns-revealed-on-social-media\" title=\"\">violent domestic political unrest</a>, the potential for explosive conflict in 2020 was high.</p> <p>In north-east Syria, Trump dismayed European allies while delighting Russia and the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad by ordering the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/13/trump-us-troops-northern-syria-turkish-assault-kurds]%0D\" title=\"\">withdrawal of US troops</a>. His decision gave the green light to a Turkish invasion that targeted the west\u2019s Kurdish <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/25/observer-view-on-syria-the-wests-shameful-failure-to-act\" title=\"\">allies in the fight against Isis</a>. In Idlib, the last populated province not under Assad\u2019s control, hundreds of civilians and aid workers were killed by Russian and Syrian forces while hundreds of thousands were displaced.</p> <p>The lack of joined-up western policy in the Middle East, and clashing US-Europe interests, were on disastrous show in Israel, where Trump took a series of unilateral steps. The US recognised Israel\u2019s sovereignty over Jerusalem and the captured Golan Heights, and claimed Israeli settlements in the Palestinian territories <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/18/us-israeli-settlements-no-longer-considered-illegal-palestinian-land-mike-pompeo\" title=\"\">were legal</a>.</p> <p>Under Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s rightwing leadership, Israel mounted repeated military attacks on Iran-linked targets in Syria, Lebanon and Iraq, maintained the blockade of Hamas-led Gaza, and aligned with autocratic, US-allied regimes in Saudi Arabia and Egypt. Instability deepened as Netanyahu failed to win successive elections and was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/23/netanyahu-bibi-trump-pact-wrecked-prospects-regional-peace\" title=\"\">charged with corruption</a>.

          "bodyText": "A year of high anxiety was rendered more alarming by intensifying clashes of interest between world powers. As international cooperation declined, and nationalist agendas gathered strength, China, the US, Russia and Europe, and their respective allies, emulators and proxies, engaged in often dangerous competition. The Chinese communist regime\u2019s increasingly assertive behaviour at home and abroad, reflecting the authoritarian outlook of its paramount leader-for-life, Xi Jinping, produced head-on collisions with western countries, notably over Hong Kong, trade, technology and the repression of the Uighur Muslim minority in Xinjiang. When the US and Britain objected to the abusive treatment of pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong, they were told to mind their own business. Sweeping opposition victories in local elections delivered a stern rebuke to Beijing, which it ignored. After six months of unrest, neither side seemed ready to back down. The unauthorised release to western media of hundreds of internal party documents exposed a ruthless government policy to indoctrinate up to 1 million Uighurs illegally held in concentration camp-like detention centres. China claimed to be fighting Islamist terrorism. Xi also attracted strong criticism over his signature Belt and Road global investment and infrastructure initiative, which Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, called a debt trap for the unwary. His alarm reflected fears over declining US leverage in the Asia-Pacific region, Africa and Europe. This decline was further illustrated by China\u2019s mostly successful efforts to extend its sway in the South Pacific and the East and South China seas. \u201cFreedom of navigation\u201d patrols by western navies frayed tempers. Enhanced US diplomatic support and weapons sales to Taiwan, and Beijing\u2019s reported covert efforts to subvert its \u201crenegade province\u2019s\u201d presidential election next month, also fuelled tensions. In a defence white paper, China stressed its peaceful intentions but also its \u201ccombat readiness\u201d and region-wide war-fighting capabilities. Before seeming to agree a trade deal in mid-December, Donald Trump escalated US-China rivalries on another front, imposing swingeing tariffs on imports and ostracising Huawei, the state-backed telecoms company. China retaliated in kind even as national economic growth slowed. The result was increased market volatility, bad blood and fears of another global economic crash. Trump\u2019s confrontational and chaotic policies caused problems around the world. After prematurely boasting he had eliminated the North Korean nuclear threat, he failed to nail down a substantive agreement. The latter half of the year saw renewed weapons tests by Kim Jong-un\u2019s regime, which set a 31 December deadline for progress. Chaos reigns in the Middle East In the Middle East, confusion reigned as Trump pushed Iran to the brink of war, then pulled back. With damaging US economic and financial sanctions, plus a global oil embargo still in place, and with Iran experiencing unprecedented levels of violent domestic political unrest, the potential for explosive conflict in 2020 was high. In north-east Syria, Trump dismayed European allies while delighting Russia and the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad by ordering the withdrawal of US troops. His decision gave the green light to a Turkish invasion that targeted the west\u2019s Kurdish allies in the fight against Isis. In Idlib, the last populated province not under Assad\u2019s control, hundreds of civilians and aid workers were killed by Russian and Syrian forces while hundreds of thousands were displaced. The lack of joined-up western policy in the Middle East, and clashing US-Europe interests, were on disastrous show in Israel, where Trump took a series of unilateral steps. The US recognised Israel\u2019s sovereignty over Jerusalem and the captured Golan Heights, and claimed Israeli settlements in the Palestinian territories were legal. Under Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s rightwing leadership, Israel mounted repeated military attacks on Iran-linked targets in Syria, Lebanon and Iraq, maintained the blockade of Hamas-led Gaza, and aligned with autocratic, US-allied regimes in Saudi Arabia and Egypt. Instability deepened as Netanyahu failed to win successive elections and was charged with corruption. A third poll looms. The Syrian fiasco cast additional doubt on Nato\u2019s cohesion. Turkey further defied its allies by buying a Russian missile system. Trump continued to denigrate the alliance and flounced out of a fractious summit in London after fellow leaders mocked him. Emmanuel Macron, France\u2019s president, who favours stronger EU defence, said Nato was \u201cbrain dead\u201d. Russia meddles If the aim of Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, is to divide and weaken the western democracies, 2019 was a golden year. Russia\u2019s Middle East leverage rose sharply, notably in Turkey, Syria and Libya. Collaboration with China expanded. Moscow\u2019s disruptive hybrid warfare and online disinformation campaigns roiled Britain, eastern Europe and the Balkans. In the US, the Mueller report and the impeachment inquiry into Trump\u2019s actions in Ukraine exposed both Russia\u2019s hidden hand and the skill with which Putin has outmanoeuvred US intelligence agencies, hoodwinked Republicans, and made a \u201cuseful idiot\u201d out of Trump. The impeachment process starkly exposed divisions ahead of a 2020 presidential battle that promises to be uncommonly destructive. America\u2019s neuroses seemed to radiate outwards.

Bolivia\u2019s long-serving leftwing president Evo Morales tried his hand at election-rigging and was ousted \u2013 an outcome that, for once, was not Trump\u2019s fault. In Brazil, rightwing populist Jair Bolsonaro became president in January and quickly established himself as a global bogeyman \u2013 principally over attempts to exploit the Amazon rainforest by burning it down. In Canada, prime minister Justin Trudeau was his own worst enemy, narrowly winning re-election despite the so-called blackface scandal.

The geopolitical paralysis of the UN security council over issues such as Syria, Israel-Palestine, Ukraine-Crimea, and Libya, usually pitting the US and Europe against China and Russia \u2013 and sometimes Europe against the US \u2013 mostly continued unchecked. Efforts to end the Yemen conflict achieved little. The same was true in Afghanistan, where it emerged that Nato and Afghan government forces were killing more civilians than the Taliban.

Coming back, James says he is shell-shocked.<br> </p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve lost everything,\u201d he says. \u201cOur house is on a separate property. My wife, son and our dog left at 10.30 for Mt Barker. At about 11am I had to choose between staying to defend the vineyard, or going to defend our home. I had to make that choice. The result is our house \u2013 our home \u2013 is still standing, but the vineyard\u2019s gone. We\u2019ve lost our livelihood.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOnce our house was safe, I went to help a friend with his home. I figured the vineyard was toast, there was nothing I could do there, so I might as well go help friends.\u201d</p> <p>As the fire swept through, James says \u201ccooked\u201d the decades-old vine plantings and melted the winery on the property. A neighbouring cherry orchard was also destroyed in the blaze.</p> <p>\u201cWe were only a small producer, we make 1000 cases a year but all our stock was in the winery,\u201d James said. \u201cAll the barrels of our last vintage. All our wine in tanks. All the wine in the tank is still there, but it\u2019s probably cooked too.</p> <p>\u201cI got a photo of some bottles that were sitting on top of a filing cabinet and the bottles have melted or collapsed. Someone said to me that the melting point of glass is 1400 to 1600 degrees. It would have been fucking hot in there. Excuse my language.\u201d</p> <p>James says the biggest problem going forward is going to be income. The couple planted their first vines on the property in 1999 and it will take years for them to recover or regrow. In the meantime, they have a multi-million dollar mortgage to pay.</p> <p>\u201cSomeone told me there\u2019s a chance the vines may recover and come back,\u201d James says. \u201cI\u2019m usually a positive person, but I just don\u2019t know.

Customers with solar panels made up about 16% of all residential customers in the National Electricity Market (NEM) in 2018-19, compared to 0.2 per cent in 2007-08.</p> <p>Many of these policies, such as premium Feed-in Tariff (FiT) rebates, result in additional costs for retailers that ultimately flow through to customers\u2019 electricity bills, unless funded through other means. The costs of such schemes accounted for $103 or 41% of the long-term increase in household bills between 2007\u201308 and 2018\u201319.</p> <p>...For example, the average household pays about $550 a year (or 9.4 cents per kWh) more than a household with solar panels, a situation the ACCC believes raises significant questions about fairness.</p> <p>\u201cThe cost of installing solar panels has reduced significantly in recent years, so environmental schemes like the premium FiT rebates are no longer needed to make solar an attractive option for those households that can afford it,\u201d Sims said.</p> <p>\u201c<strong>Indeed, all customers who can, should consider how much they could save by installing solar panels.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u201cWe are primarily concerned about the additional costs such schemes have imposed on households that cannot access or afford to install solar panels,\u201d Sims said.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u201cFunding environmental schemes through government budgets rather than through increased electricity charges should also be considered as a more equitable option.\u201d</strong></p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-22T00:32:44.886Z\">at 12.32am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5dfeb7b58f085eda5c10c2dd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-22T00:25:07.920Z\">12.25am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A very welcome piece of good news from the NSW RFS \u2013 a missing man has been found, safe.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NSWRFS/status/1208542777778130947\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">In some good news: A missing gentleman from the village of Dargan has been located safe and sound this morning by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nswpolice?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@nswpolice</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/NSWRFS?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#NSWRFS</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/nswfires?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#nswfires</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/WmvwDRboe7\">pic.twitter.com/WmvwDRboe7</a></p>&mdash; NSW RFS (@NSWRFS) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NSWRFS/status/1208542777778130947?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 22, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-22T00:26:08.349Z\">at 12.26am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5dfeb67c8f087e8308e62962\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-22T00:19:21.791Z\">12.19am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Scott Morrison </strong>is still making his way to an evacuation centre in Picton</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5dfeb6398f087e8308e6295c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-22T00:18:41.672Z\">12.18am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">South Australia fire update</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <blockquote> <p><br><strong>Royce Kurmelovs </strong>has provided an update on the South Australian fires for us:</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <blockquote> <p>Adelaide has woken up to the smell of smoke as a haze lingers over the city from fires burning in the Adelaide Hills and on Kangaroo Island in the south, but the South Australian CFS says it is hopeful they will have a handle on the situation in the coming days.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>While the CFS is not confident enough to issue a statement on containment, cool conditions overnight have allowed fire crews to get on the front foot, with back-burning operations currently being performed in an effort to contain the Cudlee Creek fires in the northwest.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>So far the blaze in that area has consumed over 25,000 hectares, destroyed homes and properties, injured lifestock and native wildlife.

The RFS and the fire services around Australia are run by state governments so it is not for the commonwealth to step in and make decisions. </p> <p>But these are things that I think can be contemplated. </p> <p>But I very much want to do that in consultation with state and territory governments. </p> <p>As I said to the commissioner today, whatever they need, whatever they think they need to bolster support, sustain the operations that they are running, they simply need to ask. </p> <p>And they will get that support. </p> <p><strong>I think there are immediate issues that need to be addressed there with the rural firefighters, particularly as they get into areas of terrible fatigue now.</strong> </p> <p>... They have been fighting fires for a while now and they are still going. Thankfully, as I was briefed this morning, those parts of the state are more under today than they were when I was there not that long ago. </p> <p><strong>But these are the many issues that I think we need to understand. Let\u2019s not forget, there are 210,000 rural firefighters around the country, and there are thousands of surf-lifesavers who will be patrolling our beaches, those who are volunteering on meals on wheels and carers and others. </strong></p> <p>Australia is a magnificent country because it does have that volunteer spirit. And Australia relies on them and they should be celebrated and we do so. </p> <p>And where there are ways that we can further support that volunteer effort, we are very open to considering this. </p> <p>Let me say one thing, all our firefighters are professionals. They are all professional at what they do. </p> <p>They are well-trained and they are very good at what they do. One of the things we focused on this morning was ensuring how we can better supplement the clearing work and the other things that need to be done in those areas that have been ravaged by fires and ensure that we can get even more prompt defence support into those arrangements. </p> <p>There has been defence liaisons in these \u2026 there has been in Queensland other places, and I am sure we can get some \u2026 at local level as well through the state government. </p> <p>The defence forces being deployed in those, defence force members who are firefighters, are out there fighting fires, just like any other employee would be. </p> <p>They are not in their platoons, they are in their brigades.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-21T23:02:12.245Z\">at 11.02pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5dfe9f008f08c3972263ed91\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-21T22:40:57.334Z\">10.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Scott Morrison </strong>on why the government is not considering changing its climate change policy:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Kyoto targets set by the previous Labor government, when we came to government, there was the projection that we would miss those by some 700 million tonnes. </p> <p>Now we\u2019re going to beat them \u2026 And I would hope that not only will we meet, and I\u2019m sure we will, our Paris commitments, that we will beat them as well. </p> <p>And there is a long time between now and 2030 and we will continue to refine our policies because we\u2019re about taking action. </p> <p><strong>But what we will not do is act in a knee-jerk or crisis or panicked mode.

Is anything happens? </p> <p>Or have they thought of this? I understand that those anxieties are positively meant and are natural. </p> <p>But I want to reassure you that this- our officials, our commissioners, our firefighters, both those professionals who are paid and those who are unpaid, they are doing this year-round to prepare for events just like this. </p> <p>And that is why this response is something where we\u2019re seeing the best of Australia, not the contrary. Flowing on from that public anxiety, there is also been other issues that have been raised, not just about the response and the resources which I think I have addressed, but also around issues of climate policy. </p> <p>It is also been the case - our Government has always and I have always acknowledged the connection between these weather events and these broader fire events and the impacts globally of climate change. <br></p> <p>It\u2019s one of many factors as I have said. The drought conditions have certainly been a big contributor in terms of the dryness of the fuel load. </p> <p>There are also many other issues as you would be well aware and they\u2019ll all come under scrutiny as we prepare for what needs to happen next time - issues of management in national parks of fuel loads, issues of back-burning and managing native vegetation and building codes and all of these sorts of things, ensuring our communications programs are important. </p> <p>I mean, there are some fires that have been started by just carelessness. Others sadly have been the result of direct arson. Many have been created by dry lightning strikes. </p> <p>And understanding all of that it will be important as we move through to the next phase. </p> <p>There is no argument, in my view on the view of the government, and any government in the country, about the links between broader issues of global climate change and weather events around the world but I\u2019m sure people would equally acknowledge the direct connection to any single fire event is not a credible suggestion to make that link. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5dfe9a1b8f085eda5c10c270\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-21T22:21:00.593Z\">10.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>He moves on to the anxiety he says he sees the community dealing with:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In talking to the Commissioner, I want to acknowledge what he has acknowledged - and that is as we face these fires at the moment, I want to assure Australians of this because I know people are anxious and I know people in some places are rightly fearful of what is literally at their door, and the haze and the smoke and all of these things heighten that anxiety as you think about your kids and your family and your can see the red tinge at night if you\u2019re close enough, but our fire services in Australia are the best in the world. </p> <p>The response to these disasters, these fires, is the best in the world. </p> <p>This is a time when Australia should be very, very proud that we have the best-resourced, most-coordinated, best-equipped fire services of any nation on earth to deal with this. </p> <p>And that\u2019s because as a country, we\u2019re used to dealing with fires - admittedly and very rightly this season is much more lengthened and started a lot earlier and there isn\u2019t the respite rains that we can expect any time soon and that is making this season harder than we have seen in a long time. </p> <p>But it is also true that after every fire, we sit down, we learn the lessons and we make sure we\u2019re better prepared next time and that\u2019s what\u2019s happened on this occasion. </p> <p>The coordination is seamless between not only the states and the Commonwealth, but between the states and overseas jurisdictions as well. </p> <p>Our defence forces are deploying wherever they\u2019re called upon and particularly now as you look at the burnt-out vast territories across particularly here in New South Wales, but in other states as well, there is wreckage to clear, there are trees to remove, there is access that needs to be provided to people\u2019s properties and businesses and homes, and that\u2019s the work that our defence forces can, are and will continue to play and they have been doing it since September - airlifting, ensuring they\u2019re providing night flights for recognisance, and providing that heavy support that is backing in and complementing the amazing work of our firefighters. </p> <p>There\u2019s some 70,000 firefighters here in New South Wales alone. That\u2019s bigger than the entire of our defence forces and reserves. </p> <p>So we\u2019re talking about an enormous force that has drawn together here in New South Wales and that\u2019s about a third of the national force. So they will continue to get everything that they need and I have run through some matters this morning with the Commissioner and I have been speaking to the Premier as well - <strong>there will be a COAG meeting in March </strong>and at that meeting, as always, I have already put on the agenda the response capabilities for future disasters and lessons, of course, will be learned by these responses but I do know the response you\u2019re seeing right now is informed by how this work has gone on each and everyday since the last fire. </p> <p>I mean, emergency management Australia which is the Commonwealth agency responsible for our engagement, both in drawing in the ADF and the other systems of support, including the important income support, later today I\u2019ll be announcing with the Premier further disaster assistance payments into new areas of affected areas as three payments have been rolling out. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5dfe99b18f085eda5c10c26e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-21T22:17:22.253Z\">10.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Scott Morrison</strong> moves into addressing the issues which have exploded since he left on his holiday:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are over 100 fires active in New South Wales today and many of those are quite serious, but I do remind people that there are also severe fires in South Australia and in Victoria. </p> <p>I spoke to the South Australian Premier last night when I arrived back in Australia to get an update and there\u2019s been loss of life there and there are fears for others. </p> <p>We have heard further news this morning of people missing, an individual missing out in Lithgow where the fires also have raged overnight. </p> <p>No-one wants to be out there fighting these fires, no-one wants these fires to be happening at this time. </p> <p>But when those fires do occur, as they have for a very long time in this country, then those who have - there\u2019s over 200,000 of them in Australia - who have signed up and put their hand up to be there to defend their communities, then they go out and they do this work and they do it on behalf of all of us and they\u2019re getting tired and they\u2019re getting fatigued because this has been going for a very long time and this is one of the key issues I have been in discussion with the Commissioner about thismorning and also with the Premier and I know that Minister Littleproud, who joins me here and I thank him for that, David, and the work you have been doing, and the Deputy Prime Minister during my absence, we will continue to look at all of these issues as we go forward.

The fire authorities said they did all the preparations they could - including hazard reduction burns, but the group of former fire chiefs who came to prominence at the beginning of this season (which started early) said they wanted to talk about how to prepare for this new normal.</p> <p><strong>Paul Karp</strong> has found Labor\u2019s bushfire policy from the election, given this debate. </p> <p>The bushfire season in Australia is lengthening and already overlapping with the northern hemisphere, increasing the risk that we won\u2019t be able to access the aircraft we need at times of peril. <br></p> <p>At the same time, the Federal Government\u2019s contribution to the National Aerial Firefighting Centre has plummeted from 50 per cent of funding to just 23 per cent, reducing our overall firefighting capability. </p> <p>The Bureau of Meteorology has identified this summer as Australia\u2019s hottest on record, which included devastating bushfires in Victoria and Tasmania. Now is the time to invest in giving our firefighters the resources they need to keep us all safe.</p> <p>Labor\u2019s national firefighting package will deliver:</p> <p> <strong>$80 million to establish the National Aerial Bushfire Fighting Fleet of aircraft</strong></p> <p>It will include retro-fitted Black Hawk helicopters as they are phased out from active use by the Australian Army and Erickson S-64 Air-crane helicopters (or \u2018Elvis\u2019 as they are commonly known) which has a 2,650 gallon tank capable of snorkelling or scooping fresh or salt water.<br></p> <p>It\u2019s expected that the national fleet will include a standing capability of up to six Large or Very Large Air Tankers, and up to 12 heavy rotary wing helicopters.</p> <p><strong>Australia\u2019s first \u2018smokejumper\u2019 units</strong><br></p> <p>Smokejumpers are firefighters trained to be rapidly deployed by helicopters at remote fires during the short window during which those fires can be contained.</p> <p>Smokejumpers usually rappel from helicopters and use chain-saws, hoes and other dry firefighting tools to establish a containment perimeter around the fire. They then patrol the perimeter to ensure the fire does not jump containment lines while working with water-bombing aircraft to ensure the contained fire is fully extinguished.</p> <p><strong>$21 million for the National Aerial Firefighting Centre (NAFC)</strong></p> <p>A Shorten Labor Government will stop the Federal Government\u2019s reduction in funding for our firefighting capabilities by returning to a 50-50 funding split between the states and territories and the Commonwealth.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5dfe92888f087e8308e628e3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-21T21:52:51.078Z\">9.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Scott Morrison\u2019s</strong> return to Australia last night has brought him back on deck a day before he was scheduled back to work - the PMO told reporters, including <strong>Samantha Maiden</strong>, that Morrison would be back to work on Monday, late last week </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/samanthamaiden/status/1207793946920812544\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">No, his office said yesterday Monday Dec 23</p>&mdash; \ud835\udd64\ud835\udd52\ud835\udd5e\ud835\udd52\ud835\udd5f\ud835\udd65\ud835\udd59\ud835\udd52 \ud835\udd5e\ud835\udd52\ud835\udd5a\ud835\udd55\ud835\udd56\ud835\udd5f (@samanthamaiden) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/samanthamaiden/status/1207793946920812544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 19, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5dfe90458f08c3972263ed5a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-21T21:41:52.866Z\">9.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>At least one person died in the Adelaide Hills fire which blazed last night, with another reported missing.

If you need updates on the fire situations: \u2022 The CFS site is for South Australia \u2022 The VicEmergency site is for Victoria \u2022 The RFS site is for New South Wales There are two fires at watch and act level in New South Wales: the Gosper Mountains fire and the Grose Valley fire. Authorities are keeping an eye on ember activity in Athelstone in South Australia from the Cudlee Creek fire. Although conditions have been less severe today, it is expected the fires will continue without significant rainfall. We will have updates in the morning, and in the meantime, please stay safe. My colleague Helen Davidson wrote this just two days ago about the effort to save Balmoral. It\u2019s so utterly devastating that almost all of the town is gone now. AAP has some more horrific detail on the extent of the devastation in Balmoral. The town has around 150 houses and a population of 400. There is \u201cnot much left\u201d but we don\u2019t know exactly how many homes were destroyed yet. AAP: Matthew Deeth, who\u2019s the mayor of the neighbouring Wollondilly Shire Council, says everyone knows everyone in the small village. \u201cThey were all banding together until they got hit yesterday and they were just decimated,\u201d Deeth said on Sunday. \u201cMost people were pulled out of their houses and if there was nobody defending houses they kind of just all lit up.\u201d Residents in the nearby town of Bargo, north-east of Balmoral, were counting themselves lucky on Sunday. One house in Bargo\u2019s Ashby Close was lost to the Green Wattle Creek blaze, with fire damaging a number of other properties in the street. Joe Cefai, 50, said the blaze just missed his home. Cefai, who evacuated with his two young children and a neighbour, lost a number of buildings next to his house. \u201cIt could have been far worse,\u201d he said on Sunday. \u201cI could have easily kissed my home goodbye. To return to see how close it did get, words can\u2019t explain.\u201d A total fire ban has been declared for tomorrow in the Mount Lofty Ranges in South Australia. An update on the situation in Victoria from AAP: Bushfires in Victoria\u2019s East Gippsland have been downgraded as firefighters get a leg up on blazes thanks to milder weather conditions. A watch and act warning remains active on Sunday for Tambo Crossing, Wattle Circle and Stirling, while the bushfire at Marthavale- Barmouth Spur is still not under control. \u201cEmergency services may not be able to help you if you decide to stay,\u201d the VicEmergency website states. Fire crews have managed to get a handle on two blazes with warnings lowered to advice across Goroke, Lawloit, Little Desert, Peronne, Burnbank, Evansford and surrounding towns. One of the fires, the Lexton-Ben Major bushfire in the vicinity of Mt Lonarch, has been contained after burning through 2,711 hectares, and an advice warning in place. It comes as the temperature took a dip on Sunday with about 24C forecast in Tambo Crossing and a milder 22C in Melbourne after a top of 44C in the Victorian capital. The bushfires have been burning since 21 November but flared up on Saturday after a cool change came through and brought dry lightning strikes. ABC is reporting SA premier Steven Marshall has said 72 homes have been destroyed in the Cudlee Creek fire. It is up from 15 yesterday. A total of 404 outbuildings and 227 vehicles were also destroyed in the fire. Here\u2019s a bit more on what the Australian defence force has been doing to help out the firefighting effort in the past day. An aerial tanker has been provided to the NSW RFS from the RAAF base in Richmond. The HMAS Albatross has helped with water refuelling and retardant loading for the Currowan fires from the naval air station in Nowra. The army is also supplying personnel to prepare meals three times a day for 250 firefighters in the northern rivers region from November until mid-January. It is also assisting with transport and logistics for the RFS in Glen Innes, Kempsey, Casino, Wollondilly and in the Hawkesbury. Helicopters and accomodation are also being supplied You can read more about what defence is doing to help out here. I am going to leave you in the very, very capable hands of my colleague Josh Taylor for the rest of the afternoon. Conditions continue to be a lot better than yesterday, but that just means firefighters are having to try and use what time they have to get ahead of what is coming after that. Please pay attention to the alerts and make sure your plan is ready. Thank you for following along with me today \u2013 and as always, take care of you and those around you. Journalist Royce Kurmelovs has another update from the South Australian fires: James Tilbrook coughs from the smoke inhalation as he picks through the wreckage of his Adelaide Hills vineyard. \u201cIt\u2019s not good,\u201d James says of both the cough and the scene. The boutique Tilbrook Estate winery and vineyard is run by James and his wife Annabelle, who fled their property on Friday morning as the Cudlee Creek fires started to burn out of control. Coming back, James says he is shell-shocked. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost everything,\u201d he says. \u201cOur house is on a separate property. My wife, son and our dog left at 10.30 for Mt Barker. At about 11am I had to choose between staying to defend the vineyard, or going to defend our home. I had to make that choice. The result is our house \u2013 our home \u2013 is still standing, but the vineyard\u2019s gone. We\u2019ve lost our livelihood.\u201d \u201cOnce our house was safe, I went to help a friend with his home. I figured the vineyard was toast, there was nothing I could do there, so I might as well go help friends.\u201d As the fire swept through, James says \u201ccooked\u201d the decades-old vine plantings and melted the winery on the property. A neighbouring cherry orchard was also destroyed in the blaze. \u201cWe were only a small producer, we make 1000 cases a year but all our stock was in the winery,\u201d James said. \u201cAll the barrels of our last vintage. All our wine in tanks. All the wine in the tank is still there, but it\u2019s probably cooked too. \u201cI got a photo of some bottles that were sitting on top of a filing cabinet and the bottles have melted or collapsed. Someone said to me that the melting point of glass is 1400 to 1600 degrees. It would have been fucking hot in there. Excuse my language.\u201d James says the biggest problem going forward is going to be income. The couple planted their first vines on the property in 1999 and it will take years for them to recover or regrow. In the meantime, they have a multi-million dollar mortgage to pay. \u201cSomeone told me there\u2019s a chance the vines may recover and come back,\u201d James says. \u201cI\u2019m usually a positive person, but I just don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t believe it.\u201d Some friends have already set up a fundraiser for the family. Victorian fire update, courtesy of AAP: Bushfires in Victoria\u2019s East Gippsland have been downgraded as firefighters get a leg up on blazes thanks to milder weather conditions. A watch and act warning remains active on Sunday for Tambo Crossing, Wattle Circle and Stirling, while the bushfire at Marthavale \u2013 Barmouth Spur is still not under control. \u201cEmergency Services may not be able to help you if you decide to stay,\u201d the VicEmergency website states.

The bushfires have been burning since November 21 but flared up on Saturday after a cool change came through and brought dry lightning strikes. A relief centre has been set up at the Omeo memorial hall, 60 kilometres north, for people affected while generators have been set-up to restore power and services. Hundreds of firefighters on the ground and in the air have been working across the state to contain the fires, which are concentrated in steep and largely inaccessible terrain. People are advised to monitor the VicEmergency website. Anthony Albanese\u2019s office has just released the transcript to the press conference, which includes this line at the end: In terms of this crisis, I have tried to visit the Rural Fire Service headquarters \u2026 Minister Littleproud, can I say this, has been exemplary at providing information and briefings to the opposition, but I have made a request now for days to visit the rural fire service. And that request has not been met up to this point. That would be the headquarters Scott Morrison held his \u201cI have returned\u201d press conference from this morning. From my time covering state politics in Queensland, those decisions are usually up to the state government. You can hear the terror and the frustration in this video. These fires \u2013 they are different. It\u2019s not just authorities saying it. It\u2019s those on the ground, the \u201cquiet Australians\u201d who have lived through previous seasons, but not like this. Which is why politicians saying they\u2019ve seen smoke haze in Sydney before, or that we\u2019ve always had fires, or quoting Dorothea Mackellar is not good enough, on any measure. NSW police say a man is missing in Lithgow, following a fire. From AAP: NSW police say a man is missing from the rural village of Bell after a huge bushfire tore through the Lithgow area, destroying dozens of buildings. The man in his 60 or 70s lives on a remote property in Bell and the area was engulfed in fire on Saturday, NSW police chief inspector Chris Sammut said on Sunday. Another elderly man who had been missing from neighbouring Dargan has been located \u201csafe and sound\u201d, the Rural Fire Service tweeted on Sunday morning. He was found at an evacuation centre in Lithgow which was threatened by the huge Gospers Mountain megafire over the weekend. Sammut said the man who was still unaccounted for lived on one of the remotest properties in Bell. \u201cHe may have self-evacuated or went to stay with friends and we want the public to let us know any information they have to assist us locate this missing person,\u201d he said. Sammut confirmed up to five properties were burned in Lithgow on Saturday while about 30 buildings were lost in Clarence and Dargan. Those numbers include sheds and other structures. About 350 residential homes in Lithgow remained without power on Sunday afternoon. For those who missed the prime minister\u2019s press conference, here is the beginning, including where he apologises for causing anxiety: But I am comforted by the fact that Australians would like me to be here simply so I can be here alongside them as they\u2019re going through this terrible time. And I say to those Australians who I caused upset to, and I apologise for that. It is important I think when you [are] confronted with these things you front up and are honest with people and that is what I am seeking to do now. The time for that discussion is over. We need to focus on what is going out there today. Bits and pieces are slowly coming out of Balmoral. Anthony Albanese says he won\u2019t be leaving Australia this summer, and thanked David Littleproud for being \u201cexemplary\u201d in providing the opposition with briefings. In the briefing that the opposition\u2019s had this morning, there are cooler conditions expected as we\u2019re experiencing today, over the next few days, but north-western Australia is a real issue. And of course, when you have heat, that\u2019s where the heat begins. And it\u2019s there now and is expected to come across the country to the east coast to the more heavily populated areas over the next week. Around north Queensland, around Townsville, Mount Isa and in that area, is also being looked at very carefully at the moment. And people should bear in mind the warnings that are there if they are thinking of going on driving holidays, for example, down the south coast, they need to listen to the expert advice which is there and not take any risks. The first priority is keeping people safe. And I thank minister Littleproud for the ongoing briefings that he\u2019s provided, and the personal discussions I\u2019ve had with him as well. Back to Scott Morrison\u2019s decision to leave Australia, Anthony Albanese says: I wouldn\u2019t have made the decision that he made to go \u2013 that is a matter for him and his family circumstances and it is difficult \u2013 I haven\u2019t sought during this week to, to pass judgment on that, it\u2019s a matter for his judgment. He chose to leave. He chose also to do it in a way that I think created a major issue of secrecy. This government has a real problem with being accountable with any scrutiny whatsoever, and the circumstances whereby Michael McCormack wouldn\u2019t say whether he was acting prime minister or not, whereby people didn\u2019t know when Scott Morrison was coming back \u2013 and even after he said he was coming back, he didn\u2019t come back and wouldn\u2019t tell the media or public when he would be returning. I just think this government has a problem with scrutiny and openness and it\u2019s on display all the time, over so many issues. I\u2019ve raised this for a considerable period of time \u2013 it is part of Mr Morrison\u2019s character that when asked a question, that\u2019s just a straight question, he dismisses it, or he prevaricates, he speaks about the bubble, or he says it\u2019s just gossip and he won\u2019t provide answers to simple question whether it\u2019s in parliament or from the media. And I say to the media that they need to hold him to account, and we\u2019ll do our job of holding him to account in the parliament, with a whole range of issues in which he just won\u2019t provide a straight answer. Anthony Albanese on Scott Morrison\u2019s assertion his government won\u2019t be changing its emissions reduction policy: Well, I just find it staggering that in the current circumstances, whereby he\u2019s sent Angus Taylor, a discredited minister, who has been misleading parliament since his first speech, to represent our nation at Madrid to try and undermine international action on climate change, including arguing for accountancy tricks rather than lower emissions. Australians do want action on climate change. The deputy prime minister yesterday said new measures were needed and a new response \u2013 and today, going from the acting prime minister to the real prime minister, we have a dismissal of the need for any action on climate change. The government needs to listen to the International Energy Agency head, who has said it is time for Australia to get our act together. And quite clearly, when it comes to climate change, the prime minister\u2019s attitude is there\u2019s nothing to see here. It\u2019s business as usual. Well if he thinks there is nothing to see her, it\u2019s because he can\u2019t see through the smoke that\u2019s coming from those bushfires. Anthony Albanese on Scott Morrison\u2019s return from Hawaii. (Earlier in the week, Albanese said he would not be criticising the PM for taking leave.) Now I note that today, Scott Morrison has returned from his holiday in Hawaii. It\u2019s a good thing that he is back. But we saw today no change in strategy with regard to the bushfires, a Coag meeting to be held next March. I wrote to the prime minister in November, asking him to convene Coag in November, prior to the emergency levels of the current crisis. And that was dismissed. We see no change to climate change policy. And we\u2019ve seen no commitment to provide compensation to our volunteer firefighters who are giving up working and the wages that comes with that in order to help their communities, but they\u2019ve still got to pay the rent, they\u2019re still going to pay their mortgages, they\u2019re still going to buy food for their families, and they are really struggling, they\u2019re fatigued. And there\u2019s a need for the government to look at making sure that they\u2019re properly compensated. So they don\u2019t have to choose between whether they continue to help out, or whether they have money to put food on the table for their families. Australian Associated Press has an update on the South Australian situation: Smoke from the Adelaide Hills bushfire had dropped the city\u2019s air quality rating to poor. The Environment Protection Authority says air quality readings are improving but parts of the hills and metropolitan area remain affected by bushfire smoke. The situation on Sunday was further exacerbated by an early morning temperature inversion layer which kept smoke low to the ground. The EPA said anyone with health issues or concerns should stay inside with windows and doors closed. A watch and act warning remains in place for the blaze, with the Country Fire Service reporting some renewed fire activity within the 127km perimeter. The fire has burnt through more than 25,000 hectares and destroyed at least 15 homes. Before it was sparked on Friday, the Bureau of Meteorology also reported that smoke from the NSW bushfires had made its way to Adelaide. Anthony Albanese has just held his press conference in Rozelle. Unfortunately it hasn\u2019t been broadcast as yet, and I am in Canberra, so I will bring that to you as soon as I can. We are still waiting on Anthony Albanese\u2019s press conference. It should be soon. The smoke has officially made its way north. Which brings Scott Morrison back in to the frame: I think all Australians, I think, are very proud \u2013 I know the commissioner is very proud and the premier is very proud of the services that the lead. But all Australians are extremely proud of what is being done here, and in so many places around the country. ... All Australians are proud and have a great, great reason to be proud. This is this is Australia at its best, Australia at its best, and we thank them for it. The commissioner finishes with how proud he is of the fire services: We\u2019ve seen only tragically this week, the risk is real. And the consequences can be fatal. And and as a result of the events only this week, there are there are families, there are loved ones, there are wives and there are children and there are mates, who will never be the same again because of the horrendous that unfolded this week. I could not be any more proud, not just of the extraordinary volunteers that that I have the privilege of being the commissioner for, but the entire coordinated fire response over here in NSW, partnering with the commonwealth, ... It\u2019s a massive, huge logistical operation maintaining and sustaining more than 2,000 people per shift, day and night \u2013 the people behind the scenes of people on the front line, I could not be any more proud of the extraordinary efforts and commitment and dedication that we see following rolling out day in day out, and we know that they\u2019re going to be doing it as long as their community and the people of NSW are going to be threatened and, and all we pray for is rain. And unfortunately, we need a lot of rain to start getting some reprieve. Shane Fitzsimmons on Balmoral: Unfortunately I don\u2019t have the specific numbers \u2013 there are teams in the field today. But as the premier indicated the team inside there say that it was devastating, and I think I coined the phrase \u201cthere\u2019s not a lot left or there\u2019s not much left\u201d, and that\u2019s just really confronting to contemplate and, and whether it\u2019s Balmoral or Buxton ... we are talking dozens of properties, dozens of buildings. As a matter of fact, right across all the far grounds of the last 24 hours, we could be talking about another hundred buildings that being added to the state tally so far this season. That doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s 100 homes and we need to make sure we differentiate between buildings, property and homes. The detailed analysis going on in the field now will seek to differentiate between what is a home, what is a house, what is a shed, and you know, and that takes some time, we need to access these areas. But the toll is significant. ... There\u2019s a long way to go before we really have an understanding of the magnitude and scale of the the loss and damage here as a result of these fires. Commissioner Fitzsimmons on what is coming up: We\u2019ve got to keep in mind that we\u2019re not expecting any rainfall to make any meaningful difference to these fires until January /February. That\u2019s still a way to go. We\u2019re still talking four to six weeks at best before we start to see a meaningful reprieve in the weather, based on the forecast are available. And then, as the prime minister indicated, we will want to do some very critical post-incident reviews, post-season reviews, gather the information gathered the support from firefighters and communities right across NSW. That will take some time. And the last thing we want is ad hocery or, or unnecessary reactiveness so close to the end of this season, and particularly when other states and territories are still going to have challenges heading well and truly into March. So they will need to be a very concerted effort to consolidate the learnings to ensure that we\u2019re hearing far and wide and formulate that into lessons and proposals in due course but it is certainly something [we] will be very much focused on. RFS commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons on that same issue: Fatigue management, and the drain, the relentless nature of this season is certainly taking a toll and so to is a geographic spread of the activity \u2013 you might recall for several months between July and and into September, most of the effort was really concentrated in north-east NSW, we\u2019ve now got fires spreading from north-east NSW and Queensland border down to the south coast of NSW. Those logistical challenges, those transport and, and accommodation challenges spreading and moving people right across such a broad geographic area all add to the challenges of fatigue and crew rotation. Underpinning all of this is a combination of members that are in a very strong position, a very ready position to sustain ongoing efforts and support for three days, five days at a time, coming back for rest and doing another three to five days coming back from a rest. Not everybody can do that. There are also teams that need to maintain a local presence and our local level of fire covering case we get new fires. And then on days like yesterday, where we saw such a broad area affected by catastrophic forecast and unfolding in the day, devastating fires, we saw a whole, a whole bunch of people in the order of 1,000 people stand up and make themselves available to bolster that effort. We\u2019ve got another 30 people that the prime minister met this morning in at the state headquarters that have just arrived from Canada and the United States. We\u2019ve got commitments to see beyond that, from our interstate colleagues, and our overseas colleagues to help us with the fatigue management and the crew rotations and where appropriate, the bolstering of numbers on those difficult days. It is a tough challenge. It is a difficult challenge, and something that we work very closely on, and we will continue to work very closely on as we see through the balance of this season. Scott Morrison on the fatigue volunteers are facing: It\u2019s obviously one of the many significant issues that the commissioner manages with this incredible volunteer fighting force that is out there. But I gotta tell you, one of the things that commissioner told me this morning just, again, just impressed me so much is when a call went out yesterday for extra hands. An extra thousand firefighters showed up in response to that call. A thousand. That is just incredible. People know what\u2019s at stake and they\u2019re all making their contribution. Scott Morrison on the scheduled March Coag: Well, the immediate needs as I said this morning, simply require the requests to come forward as they do through the regular meetings that are held of the fire chiefs and commissioners. The ministers responsible ... they only met a few weeks ago. And what we need to do in March is to ensure that we deal with the recommendations that come out from many of the lessons that have come through these fires not just here in NSW, but in other states and territories as well that have been affected. And we look forward to receiving those proposals then, right now they are fighting fires, and we don\u2019t want them sitting around writing submissions. We want them [to] obviously be focused on the operational tasks they have in front of them. Coag has been very busy over the back end of this year, particularly dealing with a lot of the environmental issues that we\u2019ve been working on and waste management which I thank the premier for her support on and will be considering those proposals. A lot of the ministers have been meeting through their various councils in recent weeks and months. And that means there will be a really good body of work that comes forward to character in March which will be in NSW and it\u2019ll be in Rooty Hill. And I\u2019m looking forward to bring out their their wonderful new facility out there in Rooty Hill. From Australian Associated Press: More than 3,000 properties in the Adelaide Hills remain without power as a result of the devastating bushfire that swept through the region and continues to burn. SA Power Networks says crews are working in a number of areas to restore electricity supply. But it says the timeframe to have all power restored is unclear, and in some cases it could take several days depending on access and the extent of the damage. The company said it had already identified a number of spots where trees had fallen on powerlines. \u201cAnyone in fire-damaged areas is urged to keep clear of power poles and wires as there may still be some that haven\u2019t been inspected,\u201d it said. Among those without electricity are properties in Woodside, Lenswood, Mt Torrens, Charleston and Lobethal. The Adelaide Hills fire has so far burnt out more than 25,000 hectares inside a 127km perimeter. A watch and act warning remains in place for the blaze which has destroyed at least 15 homes. RFS commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons says fire authorities don\u2019t expect any real relief in terms of conditions until well into January. Gladys Berejiklian: Question: There\u2019s been concern in Balmoral specifically about when people will be able to get back in and see whether or not their home is still standing? Berejiklian: Look, it\u2019s devastating not knowing whether your property is standing or not. Unfortunately, we have received bad news. There isn\u2019t much left [in Balmoral]. I might ask the commissioner to add to my comments. I understand expert teams are going in on the ground in a lot of those communities today, to make full assessments and to let people know when it is safe to go back. Even if people have lost their properties, they still want to go back to see what\u2019s left and if there is anything they can salvage. We know that\u2019s part of the recovery. We want people to have access to their land, to their property, as soon as they can, but it has to be safe. Scott Morrison: As the premier has just said, the category C assistance is being extended to the Wollondilly shire. That, as the premier said, includes payments for small producers and businesses of up to $15,000 and includes things like mental health support and small grants to communities in both shires to help them rebuild particularly with community resilience programs and things of that nature coming out of that fund. That support is going to over \u2013 around 40 local government areas around NSW at the moment. It\u2019s the same sort of support that\u2019s been provided in many other parts, say, of Queensland where they have had the fires as well in recent times. These programs are designed to help people with their immediate needs. The premier and I have agreed also this morning that those $1,000 disaster assistance recovery payments that are paid to \u2013 for each individual and the $400 that are paid for each and \u2013 each child, in a family, that will be extended to the shire as well. It is already in place for Wollondilly. Those arrangements will be put in place today. These things are done as a partnership. This is the best coordinated, the best resourced, the biggest-hearted response that I think we\u2019ve seen once again here from our response to these terrible disasters. It is something, I think, Australians \u2013 as I said earlier today \u2013 can be be enormously proud of, seeing their country at their best. That is what we have to keep focused on \u2013 allowing Australians to continue to be at their best, supporting them as they get tired and ensure that we can continue to roll out what has been an extraordinary performance from all of those who have been involved. Scott Morrison is called to the front \u2013 he starts with a repeated call for \u201ckindness\u201d: It is great to be here with you of course, your colleagues, and Angus Taylor, the local member, and Commissioner Fitzsimmons. Thank you, again, for the tremendous job you\u2019re doing with all of your team \u2013 all around New South Wales. As the premier said, it is humbling as you come and speak to families and individuals, you speak to volunteers, and you see the best of Australia on every single occasion. That\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing here again today. Friendships, neighbours looking after each other, simple kindnesses that are being extended. I met one wonderful, wonderful lady today from Malta. She was there with another lady, a single lady, who was finding it tough. She was looking after her. She was making sure that she gets back to her property today. She\u2019s holding her hand. That\u2019s what she\u2019s doing. And this is the \u2013 these are the \u2013 this is the grace, this is the kindness, that events like this need and that\u2019s what\u2019s being displayed here on the ground. That will continue. Not just through the ordinary everyday things that are done by members of the community off their own bat, but also by the many volunteers. We rightfully praise those in the RFS, but equally today we met with members of St John\u2019s Ambulance, the State Emergency Service \u2013 those who are looking after the care and welfare of animals, and others \u2013 there are so many people who stick up their hands in these times. We thank them very, very much for everything they are doing. Berejiklian finishes with this: The devastation is shocking. I have also been just literally bowled by the way the community\u2019s come together, the resilience and people\u2019s generosity. People with not much are giving away everything they have to support others. And it\u2019s times like these when you really appreciate what New South Wales and what Australia\u2019s about. Gladys Berejiklian: So, as you know, we announced joint funding and now that joint funding is in excess of $63m across the state and extends to a dozen councils. These two are now part of that. ... I also want to stress \u2013 I have mentioned this to the mayor who is here today \u2013 that $63m is on top of the $25m the New South Wales government\u2019s already set aside to get rid of hazardous materials and just to start the clean up. For some families, some families will be given notification they can go back to their properties, perhaps today, tomorrow. Other families have to wait. We want to make sure \u2013 no matter what people\u2019s circumstances \u2013 just the hope of being able to move forward is so important. If we pick up the tab \u2013 sometimes it costs thousands of dollars \u2013 to get the hazardous materials off the property, whether you are insured or not insured, the state government is picking up that cost to get on with rebuilding as soon as you\u2019re physically and emotionally ready to start the rebuilding process. As I\u2019ve said, we\u2019re not just here today and tomorrow but we will be with you for the weeks and months and for some communities years. Gladys Berejiklian is addressing the media \u2013 she is formally announcing the additional areas who can now access the disaster relief funding. Scott Morrison and Gladys Berejiklian have arrived at one of the Green Wattle creek fire evacuation centres \u2013 the Picton Bowling Club. About a dozen people had stayed there last night. If you haven\u2019t seen it, Lenore Taylor has written on what she took out of Scott Morrison\u2019s press conference. A taste: This isn\u2019t about an adjustment to your language, it requires an adjustment to your policy, it requires a credible policy, the kind of policy we know could benefit us economically, that business is begging you to enact so that they can invest. And we know that would mean we could fight for effective international action rather than continue to act as a hindrance. We know we can\u2019t solve the heating that is exacerbating this crisis on our own, so please don\u2019t insult our intelligence again with that \u201c1.3% of global emissions\u201d argument like you did at the start of this fire season. Given the consequences we are suffering, we should be doing everything we can, and we know that we are not. You\u2019ve just kept pretending. You\u2019ll find the whole thing here: Two more areas have been given access to disaster recovery funding. From the release: The commonwealth and NSW governments are providing another $3.5m to extend the community recovery assistance program under the Disaster Recovery Funding Arrangements (DRFA) to the Wingecarribee and Wollondilly LGAs. Premier Gladys Berejiklian said this additional funding brings the total federal-state recovery fund to more than $63m. \u201cHaving witnessed first-hand the devastation these bushfires have inflicted on locals and their communities it is vital the government act right away to provide assistance as quickly as possible,\u201d Berejiklian said. \u201cWe have already made available support for people who are suffering personal hardship; help for people whose homes have been damaged; funding for firefighting operations and to restore damaged essential public assets; and financial support for small businesses, primary producers and non-profit organisations. \u201cImportantly, we are also supporting these communities to become more resilient to disasters by extending the NSW Bushfires Economic Recovery and Community Resilience Grants Program.\u201d Victoria Mackinlay has published this photo of dead ladybugs washing up on Bondi beach, surrounded by ash The ACCC has responded to the National Electricity Market price report \u2013 and it is not as rosy as Angus Taylor made out. From the ACCC public media release: The average annual bill for households in the National Electricity Market fell in 2018\u201319 compared with the previous year, by $65 or 4%, the latest ACCC electricity markets report has found. But while average household bills fell to $1509 in 2018\u201319, households were still paying about 20% ($254) more than in 2007\u201308, and the average price for a unit of electricity drawn from the grid was about 45% higher in real terms. \u201cThere is still work to be done to make electricity more affordable for households,\u201d ACCC Chair Rod Sims said. \u201cWe continue to seek action on our previous recommendations, which we believe will help drive bills down.\u201d Further action on environmental scheme costs needed Environmental costs have been the biggest driving factor behind the increase in average household bills over the longer term, due to federal and state government policies aimed at encouraging greater uptake of renewable generation, promoting energy efficiency and reducing carbon emissions. Customers with solar panels made up about 16% of all residential customers in the National Electricity Market (NEM) in 2018-19, compared to 0.2 per cent in 2007-08. Many of these policies, such as premium Feed-in Tariff (FiT) rebates, result in additional costs for retailers that ultimately flow through to customers\u2019 electricity bills, unless funded through other means. The costs of such schemes accounted for $103 or 41% of the long-term increase in household bills between 2007\u201308 and 2018\u201319. ...For example, the average household pays about $550 a year (or 9.4 cents per kWh) more than a household with solar panels, a situation the ACCC believes raises significant questions about fairness. \u201cThe cost of installing solar panels has reduced significantly in recent years, so environmental schemes like the premium FiT rebates are no longer needed to make solar an attractive option for those households that can afford it,\u201d Sims said. \u201cIndeed, all customers who can, should consider how much they could save by installing solar panels. \u201cWe are primarily concerned about the additional costs such schemes have imposed on households that cannot access or afford to install solar panels,\u201d Sims said. \u201cFunding environmental schemes through government budgets rather than through increased electricity charges should also be considered as a more equitable option.\u201d A very welcome piece of good news from the NSW RFS \u2013 a missing man has been found, safe. Scott Morrison is still making his way to an evacuation centre in Picton Royce Kurmelovs has provided an update on the South Australian fires for us: Adelaide has woken up to the smell of smoke as a haze lingers over the city from fires burning in the Adelaide Hills and on Kangaroo Island in the south, but the South Australian CFS says it is hopeful they will have a handle on the situation in the coming days. While the CFS is not confident enough to issue a statement on containment, cool conditions overnight have allowed fire crews to get on the front foot, with back-burning operations currently being performed in an effort to contain the Cudlee Creek fires in the northwest. So far the blaze in that area has consumed over 25,000 hectares, destroyed homes and properties, injured lifestock and native wildlife. Two people have been confirmed dead within South Australia during the bushfires, and 26 CFS volunteers injured battling the blaze. Road blocks remain in effect areas as fire crews are working to manage hotspots along the perimeter and are wary of flare ups in the coming week. The Bureau of Meteorology has forecast temperatures in the 30\u2019s in South Australia, with the mercury to climb as the days wind out. Elsewhere, the \u201ccomplex\u201d series of fires on Kangaroo Island has been downgraded and is being treated as two separate fire fronts with 50 firefighters currently on the scene. A spokesperson for the CFS said mop-up operations are expected to continue. \u201cWe\u2019ll have fire crews on the firegrounds for quite some time. Even if we do get it contained, there\u2019ll be fire crews out there checking the ground doing mop up for a few days yet.\u201d I\u2019ve just been alerted to Scott Morrison addressing the US and Canadian fire fighters at the Sydney RFS headquarters, which was shown on Sunrise (which is why I missed it the first time). He cracked a joke about Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau. Let\u2019s hope he is talking about Trudeau\u2019s love of a selfie, given the circumstances.: We value the same things, we share the same values, that we will be will all be doing, over this period time \u2013 I will be making sure to pass on my personal thanks to prime minister Trudeau and president Trump later today. I\u2019ll get a pic and send it to them \u2013 I know Justin like his pictures. (There is laughter.) I\u2019m not teasing him, I promise. We\u2019ve often done that together, when we\u2019ve been together. The Grose Valley fire has been raised to \u201cemergency\u201d. The smoke haze has hit Brisbane. As of 10:30am AEDT, here\u2019s what we know the fire situation is across Australia at the moment. In New South Wales there are five fires at watch and act level: Gospers Mountain fire, Green Wattle Creek, Grose Valley, Kerry Ridge, and Upper Turon Rd, Palmers Oaky. In Victoria there are three fires at watch and act level: Tambo Crossing and Wattle Creek, Ensay and Reedy Flat and Brookville. In South Australia there are still two fires burning at Duncan and Menzies on Kangaroo Island, and a watch and act in place for a fire in Cudlee Creek. The weather conditions are a bit milder than yesterday, and there\u2019s no emergency warnings currently in place, but we will update if that changes over the course of the day. Just before Scott Morrison\u2019s press conference, RFS commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons* gave an update on the NSW fires: We have still got an enormous amount of fire burning in the landscape. Conditions are particularly dry and fire behaviour continues to be very challenging for firefighters and those areas affected by fire. A big focus this week, a significant focus this week, and starting today is the implications now for the entire Blue Mountains community along the Great Western Highway. We effectively got fire now stretching from the Darling Causeway, Lithgow area, in the western areas of the or the upper Blue Mountains, and only four, 4, 5km north of the Great Western Highway spreading all the way down to Currajong Heights, that\u2019s due north Winmalee, Springwood, which is not far the Penrith escarpment and region. We have seen widespread damage and destruction being reported across a number of those fire grounds and we have got impact assessment teams already deployed into the field this morning trying to gain access to those impacted fire grounds to do assessments and undertake surveys in order to identify the extent of damage and the extent of destruction. As we indicated last night, the reports are still indicating that we are expecting another heavy toll, unfortunately, with estimates that property loss could be in the dozens of \u2013 of buildings including homes, outbuildings, sheds and businesses. That damage and destruction effectively ranges from places like Lithgow, Clarence, Dargan, Bilpin, all along the Bells Line of Road, we got places down around Balmoral and out towards Buxton and Bargo down on the Green Wattle Creek fire. We have also got down the Currowan fire south, up in the north-west corner of that, the communities of Neriga. There\u2019s a very wide area of impact overnight and those assessments will be undertaken. *apologies for the typo in the original post Anthony Albanese will be up at 1pm. I imagine he wants Scott Morrison\u2019s press conference to sit and marinate for a while, before he adds his two cents, given you know, the prime minister wants us all to be kinder to each other, and leave any division to the side - unless of course, you need to make your own political point. For example: Scott Morrison at the beginning of the press conference: It is time to be kind to each other. This is not a time for division, it is not a time for argument, it is not a time for partisanship, not a time for point scoring. It is a time to support people who have an important job to do, to give them the space and time, to give them the support they need. Scott Morrison half way through the press conference: I know there are some who tried to make political points and score points over these issues in the midst of these disasters and that is disappointing. I will do what I said I would do because that is how I am with the Australian people. I said we will meet our 26% emission reduction target. Emissions under this government are on average 50 million tons less than they were under the previous government. Emissions have fallen over the last two years. Emissions are lower than at any time they were under the previous government. We have had record investment in renewables in Australia and now, thankfully, as a result of policies the government has put in place if we are also getting electricity prices down, some $65 a year. And on top of that we are doing it without embracing the reckless job destroying and economy crunching targets that others are seeking to force upon us. I don\u2019t think that is a balanced approach. We will take a responsible approach to taking action on climate change. This \u2018debate\u2019 if you can call it that, given Chris Smith seems to have decided his job, now that he is returning to Sydney radio 2GB is just to yell over anyone who has a different view, or you know, the facts, sums up most of the country right now: Angus Taylor has also decided right now is the perfect time to put out a release on electricity prices coming down: Residential electricity bills are coming down according to the latest Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) Inquiry into the National Electricity Market report. The November 2019 report found: a reduction in the average residential electricity retail price across the National Electricity Market (NEM) from FY2017-18 to 2018-19 of approximately 3 per cent, average annual residential electricity bills across the NEM have decreased by $65, or approximately 4 per cent, the most recent annual reduction in household bills of $65 is part of a longer-term trend that has seen bills fall by $209 in real terms since 2013-14, and average household bills across the NEM are at their lowest since 2013-14. (Which we knew they would, because a butt load of renewables have come onto the grid, which was anticipated for quite some time) So to quickly recap that press conference: Scott Morrison defended leaving the country to take a holiday (which he said he planned six weeks ago), having \u201cmade a promise to my kids\u201d but said in hindsight, he would have made a different decision. (Morrison was due to return to work, as scheduled, tomorrow, December 23, according to what his office told the New Daily\u2019s Samantha Maiden last week). I am sure Australians are fair-minded and understand that when you make a promise to your children you try and keep it, but as prime minister you have other responsibilities and I accept that and I accept the criticism and that is why Jenny and I agreed it was important that I returned, particularly after the tragedies we saw late this week. I get it that people would have been upset to know that I was holidaying with my family while their families were under great stress. They know that I will not stand there and hold a hose. I am not a trained firefighter nor am I an expert like those in the next room doing an amazing job. But I am comforted by the fact that Australians would like me to be here simply so I can be here alongside them as they go through this terrible time. He has \u201clearnt lessons\u201d including about how his office dealt with the media: I understand there is media interest in the engagement of briefings between my office and the gallery and those sorts of things, I get that. There have been lessons learned this week and they will be imported and included next time. After pointing back to the one comment he made in February linking climate change to worsening disasters \u201camong other factors\u201d for the majority of this (early) bushfire season, Morrison made an explicit point of joining the dots There is no argument, in my view, or the view of the government, and any government in the country, about the links between broader issues of global climate change and weather events around the world \u2013 but I\u2019m sure people would equally acknowledge the direct connection to any single fire event is not a credible suggestion to make that link. But there will be NO change to Australia\u2019s emissions reduction policy under his government. People can expect my government to do what it promised to do, what it took to the last election. I know there are some who tried to make political points and score points over these issues in the midst of these disasters and that is disappointing. I will do what I said I would do because that is how I am with the Australian people. I said we will meet our 26% emission reduction target. Morrison also believes the time to talk about his holiday is in the past, and the time to talk about climate change is not now. This is not a time for division, it is not a time for argument, it is not a time for partisanship, not a time for point scoring. It is a time to support people who have an important job to do, to give them the space and time, to give them the support they need. ... Australians know we need to rally together. The time for argument is not now. It is not to say there is no time to talk about climate change, of course there is and we are talking about it. But let\u2019s do it in a way that does not distract from the very immediate need of protecting people\u2019s lives, protecting their property, honouring those who are out there doing everything they can. And so I simply ask people, particularly this Christmas time, to reflect on that, to come together to support each other and to focus on the things we need to do now and on the other side of these fires, Australia will prevail. We always will. On whether he believes he has shown leadership, Scott Morrison says: This has been going on for a long time, since September, and on each occasion I have been here, whether it is in Taree or out at Wilberforce a couple of weeks ago. Not on all occasions have I gone and been there with a travelling media team. I have been there on occasions just in a low-key way, talking to those in incident control rooms, and it would seem that whether it is myself or others there will always be criticism made but what I have confidence in and have always had confidence in is in the fair mindedness of the Australian people. As I said for I take responsibility for my own decisions and I take responsibility for those I made in relation to my family and, more broadly, in terms of my leadership responsibility for the nation and that is why I am here. On Labor\u2019s proposal for tax breaks for volunteer firefighters who are unable to work while they deal with the bushfire emergency: Q: Labor wants compensation for volunteer firefighters. Is that something you are considering? Scott Morrison: I don\u2019t know what the specific proposal being proposed \u2026 I will take that where it is. But these are things that the government has been considering, in the first instance these are matters for state governments. The RFS and the fire services around Australia are run by state governments so it is not for the commonwealth to step in and make decisions. But these are things that I think can be contemplated. But I very much want to do that in consultation with state and territory governments. As I said to the commissioner today, whatever they need, whatever they think they need to bolster support, sustain the operations that they are running, they simply need to ask. And they will get that support. I think there are immediate issues that need to be addressed there with the rural firefighters, particularly as they get into areas of terrible fatigue now. ... They have been fighting fires for a while now and they are still going. Thankfully, as I was briefed this morning, those parts of the state are more under today than they were when I was there not that long ago. But these are the many issues that I think we need to understand. Let\u2019s not forget, there are 210,000 rural firefighters around the country, and there are thousands of surf-lifesavers who will be patrolling our beaches, those who are volunteering on meals on wheels and carers and others. Australia is a magnificent country because it does have that volunteer spirit. And Australia relies on them and they should be celebrated and we do so. And where there are ways that we can further support that volunteer effort, we are very open to considering this. Let me say one thing, all our firefighters are professionals. They are all professional at what they do. They are well-trained and they are very good at what they do. One of the things we focused on this morning was ensuring how we can better supplement the clearing work and the other things that need to be done in those areas that have been ravaged by fires and ensure that we can get even more prompt defence support into those arrangements. There has been defence liaisons in these \u2026 there has been in Queensland other places, and I am sure we can get some \u2026 at local level as well through the state government. The defence forces being deployed in those, defence force members who are firefighters, are out there fighting fires, just like any other employee would be. They are not in their platoons, they are in their brigades. Scott Morrison on why the government is not considering changing its climate change policy: The Kyoto targets set by the previous Labor government, when we came to government, there was the projection that we would miss those by some 700 million tonnes. Now we\u2019re going to beat them \u2026 And I would hope that not only will we meet, and I\u2019m sure we will, our Paris commitments, that we will beat them as well. And there is a long time between now and 2030 and we will continue to refine our policies because we\u2019re about taking action. But what we will not do is act in a knee-jerk or crisis or panicked mode. A panic approach and response to anything does not help. It puts people at risk. Not just their livelihood but if you walk out there into the control room you will not see people panicking, you will see people be very professional, very focused on the job they have, talking to each other in a very professional way and getting the job done. Government is the same thing. Whether it is taking action on climate change or ensuring that, as the midyear economic statement shows, that the government is on track to achieve a surplus or the further job creation that is all over the last week. Over 100,000 jobs created since last election. You get these results by being calm and by being stable. And having clear goals and having the policies in place to achieve them. Whether that is on taking action on climate change or job creation or ensuring that we get the welfare system targeted to support those who need it most or dealing with the environmental challenges of waste management and plastics and any of these issues, mental health issues, the government is addressing them. On all these issues the government has clear plans and a clear approach to deal with them and is doing it in a very patient and in a very applied and professional way. We get back to climate policy \u2013 there will be NO change. Q: The government has been criticised for using carryover credits. Going forward after these fires, how can your government provide a more genuine commitment to making Australia a responsible global actor when it comes to reducing carbon emissions? Scott Morrison: People can expect my government to do what it promised to do, what it took to the last election. I know there are some who tried to make political points and score points over these issues in the midst of these disasters and that is disappointing. I will do what I said I would do because that is how I am with the Australian people. I said we will meet our 26% emission reduction target. Emissions under this government are on average 50 million tonnes less than they were under the previous government. Emissions have fallen over the last two years. Emissions are lower than at any time they were under the previous government. We have had record investment in renewables in Australia and now, thankfully, as a result of policies the government has put in place we are also getting electricity prices down, some $65 a year. And on top of that we are doing it without embracing the reckless job destroying and economy crunching targets that others are seeking to force upon us. I don\u2019t think that is a balanced approach. We will take a responsible approach to taking action on climate change. We are taking action and we will continue to take action. We are part of a global action on the commitments we have made, we are meeting. We are meeting and we are beating. So I do not accept the suggestion that Australia is not carrying its weight. We are carrying our weight. We are meeting and beating our target and there are very few countries who can say that. Q: You said you have learned some lessons from this past week. What are they? Morrison: I think I have already outlined that in my earlier remarks. Question: You were critical of the Victorian police commissioner when she went to dinner during the Black Saturday bushfires. Scott Morrison: I have already made a number of comments today, as you know, where I think I have held myself to that same standard. Equally I would note that I am not the operational leader of an emergency service or police force. I am the prime minister. And as prime minister I was kept regularly and sought to be kept regularly updated on the events. The acting prime minister was in full control of what was it occurring ably supported by Minister Littleproud. The premier was leading, obviously the governments of the operational response here in New South Wales, and I have been in contact with the premier [regularly] on these arrangements \u2026were in place to ensure that I could continue to do and fulfil my responsibilities, but I understand and the reason I have returned is out of a deep respect and sympathy for those Australians who were tragically killed a few nights ago. That demanded my attendance here, I believe, out of simply respect and sympathy for them and what they were going through and that is why I have been pleased to return. That is a decision that Jenny [and I made] and we told the kids about it and Australians are fair-minded. They know at the end of a difficult year people go on leave and they know that when a dad makes a promise to the kids they like to keep it. And events late last week are not where they were today so I think it would be unfair to say the events in very recent days were the same as a week or so ago. Nevertheless, I understand the anxiety and my people have been upset at this and that is why I am pleased to be back. This is not exactly a glowing defence of the deputy prime minister. Q: Why were questions referred to your office; why couldn\u2019t McCormack simply say he was acting? Morrison: These are not the matters I am focused on now, I will leave those matters for others. Australians are worried about the fires and the support necessary to support those out there today. I understand there is media interest in the engagement of briefings between my office and the gallery and those sorts of things, I get that. There have been lessons learned this week and they will be imported and included next time. Question: But you knew about these catastrophic fire conditions. Are you sorry to the residents? Morrison: I already said that. I already said it. Q: Do you believe that the release of the information about this was handled poorly and the public needed to know? Morrison: The deputy minister was the acting prime minister and each time I have taken private family leave as prime minister I followed exactly the same process. There was no change. On my earlier leaves no statement was issued. I took private family leave and no objections were raised by the press on those occasions but it is something we will rectify. (No one knew he was leaving the country). Question: Where have you been and why the secrecy? Scott Morrison: I was in Hawaii, a trip with my family, a trip planned seven weeks ago and when I take family leave, it is a private family time. And then the prime minister asks us to all be kind to each other: Let me finish by saying this, and I apologise for the lengthy nature of my remarks this morning, it is time to be kind to each other. This is not a time for division, it is not a time for argument, it is not a time for partisanship, not a time for point scoring. It is a time to support people who have an important job to do, to give them the space and time, to give them the support they need. If people have something they want to contribute, that is fantastic and I want to thank all those who turned up to fire stations and made donations and you may want to think of dropping off some toys for the children of the firefighters who may not have had time to go out and buy some this Christmas because they have been too busy. These are things that people can do constructively. Australians, we need to rally together. The time for argument is not now. It is not to say there is no time to talk about climate change, of course there is and we are talking about it. But let\u2019s do it in a way that does not distract from the very immediate need of detecting people\u2019s lives, protecting their property, honouring those who are out there doing everything they can. And so I simply ask people, particularly this Christmas time, to reflect on that, to come together to support each other and to focus on the things we need to do now and on the other side of these fires, Australia will prevail. We always will. Australia is the most amazing country on earth. How do I know that? Because I see what is happening out there right now on those fire front and in the communities that have suffered terrible loss. That is why Australia is the best country in the world and that is the country I am proud to lead. know we all support in the cause which we all rally now and focus on supporting efforts of Australians. Scott Morrison says he believes Australians are \u201cfair minded\u201d and will understand why he took his holiday. Two other points. I have returned from leave and I know that has caused some great anxiety in Australia and Jenny and I acknowledge that. If we had your time over again and the benefit of hindsight we would have made different decisions. I am sure Australians are fair-minded and understand that when you make a promise to your children you try and keep it that as Prime Minister you have other responsibilities and I accept that and I accept the criticism and that is why Jenny and I agreed it was important that I returned, particularly after the tragedies we saw late this week. I get it that people would have been upset to know that I was holidaying with my family while their families were under great stress. They know that I will not stand there and hold a hose. I am not a trained firefighter nor am I an expert like those in the next room doing an amazing job. But I am comforted by the fact that Australians would like me to be here simply so I can be here alongside them as they go through this terrible time. And so to those Australians who had [cause for upset] and I apologise for that. I think it is important when you confronted with these things you front up and are honest with people and that is what I am seeking to do now. The time for that discussion is over. We need to focus on what is going out there today. And then we move on to power prices: We must take action on climate change and we are taking action on climate change. At the last election I said we would, I said we would meet and beat our Kyoto targets, I said we would meet our Paris commitments at a canter and we will. We welcome the record investment in renewable energy technologies and at the same time we welcome the fact we pursue our climate policies while getting electricity prices down as the ACCC noted today with a $65 reduction as a direct result of the policies in place to get power bills under control in this country. And we will do it without destroying the economy or jobs. We will do it with sensible target to get the balance right. That is what I promised Australians when we went to the last election and that is what I am committed to doing. We are not going to beat our Paris target \u201cin a canter\u201d. Emissions are still rising in Australia and have every year since 2014, when the carbon charge was scrapped by the Coalition. Scott Morrison on the climate change link debate: I appreciate that when things get as anxious as they have become, then people will think, you know, what\u2019s been prepared? Is anything happens? Or have they thought of this? I understand that those anxieties are positively meant and are natural. But I want to reassure you that this- our officials, our commissioners, our firefighters, both those professionals who are paid and those who are unpaid, they are doing this year-round to prepare for events just like this. And that is why this response is something where we\u2019re seeing the best of Australia, not the contrary. Flowing on from that public anxiety, there is also been other issues that have been raised, not just about the response and the resources which I think I have addressed, but also around issues of climate policy. It is also been the case - our Government has always and I have always acknowledged the connection between these weather events and these broader fire events and the impacts globally of climate change. It\u2019s one of many factors as I have said. The drought conditions have certainly been a big contributor in terms of the dryness of the fuel load. There are also many other issues as you would be well aware and they\u2019ll all come under scrutiny as we prepare for what needs to happen next time - issues of management in national parks of fuel loads, issues of back-burning and managing native vegetation and building codes and all of these sorts of things, ensuring our communications programs are important. I mean, there are some fires that have been started by just carelessness. Others sadly have been the result of direct arson. Many have been created by dry lightning strikes. And understanding all of that it will be important as we move through to the next phase. There is no argument, in my view on the view of the government, and any government in the country, about the links between broader issues of global climate change and weather events around the world but I\u2019m sure people would equally acknowledge the direct connection to any single fire event is not a credible suggestion to make that link. He moves on to the anxiety he says he sees the community dealing with: In talking to the Commissioner, I want to acknowledge what he has acknowledged - and that is as we face these fires at the moment, I want to assure Australians of this because I know people are anxious and I know people in some places are rightly fearful of what is literally at their door, and the haze and the smoke and all of these things heighten that anxiety as you think about your kids and your family and your can see the red tinge at night if you\u2019re close enough, but our fire services in Australia are the best in the world. The response to these disasters, these fires, is the best in the world. This is a time when Australia should be very, very proud that we have the best-resourced, most-coordinated, best-equipped fire services of any nation on earth to deal with this. And that\u2019s because as a country, we\u2019re used to dealing with fires - admittedly and very rightly this season is much more lengthened and started a lot earlier and there isn\u2019t the respite rains that we can expect any time soon and that is making this season harder than we have seen in a long time. But it is also true that after every fire, we sit down, we learn the lessons and we make sure we\u2019re better prepared next time and that\u2019s what\u2019s happened on this occasion. The coordination is seamless between not only the states and the Commonwealth, but between the states and overseas jurisdictions as well. Our defence forces are deploying wherever they\u2019re called upon and particularly now as you look at the burnt-out vast territories across particularly here in New South Wales, but in other states as well, there is wreckage to clear, there are trees to remove, there is access that needs to be provided to people\u2019s properties and businesses and homes, and that\u2019s the work that our defence forces can, are and will continue to play and they have been doing it since September - airlifting, ensuring they\u2019re providing night flights for recognisance, and providing that heavy support that is backing in and complementing the amazing work of our firefighters. There\u2019s some 70,000 firefighters here in New South Wales alone. That\u2019s bigger than the entire of our defence forces and reserves. So we\u2019re talking about an enormous force that has drawn together here in New South Wales and that\u2019s about a third of the national force. So they will continue to get everything that they need and I have run through some matters this morning with the Commissioner and I have been speaking to the Premier as well - there will be a COAG meeting in March and at that meeting, as always, I have already put on the agenda the response capabilities for future disasters and lessons, of course, will be learned by these responses but I do know the response you\u2019re seeing right now is informed by how this work has gone on each and everyday since the last fire. I mean, emergency management Australia which is the Commonwealth agency responsible for our engagement, both in drawing in the ADF and the other systems of support, including the important income support, later today I\u2019ll be announcing with the Premier further disaster assistance payments into new areas of affected areas as three payments have been rolling out. Scott Morrison moves into addressing the issues which have exploded since he left on his holiday: There are over 100 fires active in New South Wales today and many of those are quite serious, but I do remind people that there are also severe fires in South Australia and in Victoria. I spoke to the South Australian Premier last night when I arrived back in Australia to get an update and there\u2019s been loss of life there and there are fears for others. We have heard further news this morning of people missing, an individual missing out in Lithgow where the fires also have raged overnight. No-one wants to be out there fighting these fires, no-one wants these fires to be happening at this time. But when those fires do occur, as they have for a very long time in this country, then those who have - there\u2019s over 200,000 of them in Australia - who have signed up and put their hand up to be there to defend their communities, then they go out and they do this work and they do it on behalf of all of us and they\u2019re getting tired and they\u2019re getting fatigued because this has been going for a very long time and this is one of the key issues I have been in discussion with the Commissioner about thismorning and also with the Premier and I know that Minister Littleproud, who joins me here and I thank him for that, David, and the work you have been doing, and the Deputy Prime Minister during my absence, we will continue to look at all of these issues as we go forward. The New South Wales Rural Fire Service and all the fire services across Australia will continue to get everything they need from the Commonwealth. As you know, the operational response to these disasters is delivered and is run at a state level, but with great Commonwealth support. Scott Morrison continues: A few months ago I was up in Canungra when the first of these dreadful fires started to appear. ...When we got out to Wilberforce just a few weeks ago up in Queensland and here we are again today following the terrible tragedy that occurred earlier this week. Andrew O\u2019Dwyer and Geoffrey Keaton. Their families, Lisa and their little daughter Charlotte, 19 months. Jessica and their 19-month-old son, Harvey. When our volunteers go out there, they do it for so many reasons, but I can\u2019t help but thinking that one of the most important things that inspires them is their love of family - family is community and they\u2019re out there defending their community on that fateful night. And Jenny and I my heart broke when he heard of their terrible loss and their great sacrifice and I just want to extend to them our great sympathies, our love and support. They\u2019re getting tremendous support from their Rural Fire Service family out there at Horsley Park and from the broader families of the firefighting communities around the country. What we, the rest of us, can offer them is our honour, our acknowledgment, and our respect for what they have done for all of us. Scott Morrison: ...Men and women who are out there today here in New South Wales who were out there yesterday, the thousands of men and women around Australia, not just here in New South Wales, up in Queensland, down in South Australia where it\u2019s also been a difficult week, down in Victoria, all those that have come from other states - Tassie, the west, the ACT, up in the Territory. I want to thank those who have come from overseas - the Americans, the Canadians, our Kiwi cousins, those who have come to support us in this hour of need. I particularly want to thank Commissioner Fitzsimmons and the amazing team he leads here in New South Wales and for the opportunity to be briefed this morning. I want to commend the Premier, who I have been speaking to over the course of the last week, and for the tremendous job she\u2019s been doing with her team here in New South Wales to respond to this disaster, this threat, that is ongoing and has been going for many, many months now. The prime minster is now addressing the media. If you can, you should watch this with the sound on. The firefighters all remain so calm, despite what they are facing. The \u201cgot this\u201d at the end just sums up everything about how our volunteers are handling this. The prime minister will head to Picton after the Sydney RFS briefing, to meet with evacuees. Here is what the government has spent: Australia\u2019s aerial firefighting force has been given an $11m funding injection from the Morrison government amid growing concern about the resourcing of firefighters combating the bushfire crisis. On Thursday the federal government announced it would nearly double the commonwealth\u2019s annual contribution to the National Aerial Firefighting Centre, which coordinated the 140 aircraft used to battle fires across Australia. \u201cIn response to the request from our national fire chiefs we\u2019re backing our firefighters and our water-bombing fleet with an extra $11m boost,\u201d the prime minister, Scott Morrison said in a statement. \u201cThat\u2019s on top of the $15m we already deliver each year for aerial firefighting to tackle what has already been a devastating fire season.\u201d There is a lot of commentary over how prepared Australia was for this bushfire season. The fire authorities said they did all the preparations they could - including hazard reduction burns, but the group of former fire chiefs who came to prominence at the beginning of this season (which started early) said they wanted to talk about how to prepare for this new normal. Paul Karp has found Labor\u2019s bushfire policy from the election, given this debate. The bushfire season in Australia is lengthening and already overlapping with the northern hemisphere, increasing the risk that we won\u2019t be able to access the aircraft we need at times of peril. At the same time, the Federal Government\u2019s contribution to the National Aerial Firefighting Centre has plummeted from 50 per cent of funding to just 23 per cent, reducing our overall firefighting capability. The Bureau of Meteorology has identified this summer as Australia\u2019s hottest on record, which included devastating bushfires in Victoria and Tasmania. Now is the time to invest in giving our firefighters the resources they need to keep us all safe. Labor\u2019s national firefighting package will deliver: $80 million to establish the National Aerial Bushfire Fighting Fleet of aircraft It will include retro-fitted Black Hawk helicopters as they are phased out from active use by the Australian Army and Erickson S-64 Air-crane helicopters (or \u2018Elvis\u2019 as they are commonly known) which has a 2,650 gallon tank capable of snorkelling or scooping fresh or salt water. It\u2019s expected that the national fleet will include a standing capability of up to six Large or Very Large Air Tankers, and up to 12 heavy rotary wing helicopters. Australia\u2019s first \u2018smokejumper\u2019 units Smokejumpers are firefighters trained to be rapidly deployed by helicopters at remote fires during the short window during which those fires can be contained. Smokejumpers usually rappel from helicopters and use chain-saws, hoes and other dry firefighting tools to establish a containment perimeter around the fire. They then patrol the perimeter to ensure the fire does not jump containment lines while working with water-bombing aircraft to ensure the contained fire is fully extinguished. $21 million for the National Aerial Firefighting Centre (NAFC) A Shorten Labor Government will stop the Federal Government\u2019s reduction in funding for our firefighting capabilities by returning to a 50-50 funding split between the states and territories and the Commonwealth. Scott Morrison\u2019s return to Australia last night has brought him back on deck a day before he was scheduled back to work - the PMO told reporters, including Samantha Maiden, that Morrison would be back to work on Monday, late last week At least one person died in the Adelaide Hills fire which blazed last night, with another reported missing. More than 50 people have been injured - including 23 firefighters and two police officers. At least 15 homes have been destroyed, with about 30 other structures having also been consumed by the fire. But with residents only returning to take stock of the damage today, the number of structures destroyed is expected to rise. The government has announced the disaster recovery payment has been extended to South Australia. Claims will be open from Monday 23 December 2019. For more information or to make a claim visit www.humanservices.gov.au/disaster or call 180 22 66. Scott Morrison has not yet addressed the media - but here is what he had to say to the RFS at Sydney headquarters. Mike Bowers was at the Green Wattle Creek fire last night. Here is some of what he saw Good morning. It is another day of watch and wait as fire fighters across the east coast and south Australia keep a very, very close eye on what Emergency-level fires have swept across parts of New South Wales and South Australia, and the death toll and number of injured firefighters has risen, as the country\u2019s severe heatwave and bushfire crisis continued on Saturday. Two people were confirmed dead in South Australia, and homes were destroyed and communities evacuated in what authorities described as \u201can awful day\u201d in which fires raged across three states, even creating their own thunderstorms in some parts of NSW. At Lithgow, about two hours\u2019 drive west of Sydney, residents were forced to flee as fires threatened the community of more than 10,000 people and destroyed several homes on the outskirts of the town. At 7pm, a person was reported unaccounted for in the Dargen area, near Lithgow, the ABC reported. Four firefighters in NSW were treated for heat exhaustion on Saturday, the ambulance service said, while another firefighter was reportedly injured after being struck by a truck in Richmond. Scott Morrison has returned to Australia - he flew in late last night. He is starting the day with a briefing with the New South Wales rural fire service headquarters in Sydney. AAP have the morning update: An elderly man whose home was consumed by flames remains missing and dozens of properties have been damaged or destroyed by bushfires which raged during heatwave NSW conditions on Saturday. Rural Fire Service commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons described the day as \u201cawful\u201d for firefighters, with up to 20 homes lost to the immense Gospers Mountain fire northwest of Sydney alone. At least two more properties were razed near Batemans Bay on the south coast, and others at Balmoral southwest of Sydney. Southerly winds moving upstate on Saturday evening fanned flames in new directions and caused erratic fire behaviour, before creating cooler conditions for the 3000 firefighting and emergency personnel in the field. A fire-generated thunderstorm also formed over fires in the Shoalhaven. With forecasts predicting close to a week of advantageous conditions across NSW, Mr Fitzsimmons said his crews would \u2018make hay\u2019. Tougher conditions would likely return later in the week or next weekend. Two total fire bans will nevertheless be in place on Sunday in the Northern Slopes and North Western regions, under \u201cvery high\u201d fire danger. \u201cOur big focus is on trying to consolidate and establish containment lines across as many fire grounds as we can. We have significant fire spread south of the Bells Line of Road and through the valley system such as the Grose Valley in the Blue Mountains,\u201d Mr Fitzsimmons told reporters. \u201cSo we will be looking at what are the options, what are the fall-back lines and at what point do we start implementing very significant strategies to secure protection for an impending threat to the Blue Mountains, particularly the communities along the Great Western Highway.\u201d",

Graham died in February 2018 and was honored at a US capitol memorial service, where Trump <a href=\"https://www.christianpost.com/news/billy-graham-honored-capitol-memorial-service-trump-dad-love-america-pastor-219766/\">described him</a> as \u201can ambassador for Christ who reminded the world of the power of prayer and the gift of God\u2019s grace.\u201d </p> <p>Graham\u2019s son, Franklin, <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/franklin-graham-donald-trump-6b18159f-d481-48e2-9eb3-ea48f4eb26aa.html\">remains an ardent supporter of the president</a>. </p> <p>But Christianity Today still attracts 4.3 million monthly online reader among a demographic, evangelical Christians, that voted overwhelmingly for Trump. </p> <p>Here\u2019s an excerpt <a href=\"https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2019/december-web-only/trump-should-be-removed-from-office.html\">from the editorial</a>: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>But the facts in this instance are unambiguous: The president of the United States attempted to use his political power to coerce a foreign leader to harass and discredit one of the president\u2019s political opponents. That is not only a violation of the Constitution; more importantly, it is profoundly immoral.</p> <p>The reason many are not shocked about this is that this president has dumbed down the idea of morality in his administration. He has hired and fired a number of people who are now convicted criminals. He himself has admitted to immoral actions in business and his relationship with women, about which he remains proud. His Twitter feed alone\u2014with its habitual string of mischaracterizations, lies, and slanders\u2014is a near perfect example of a human being who is morally lost and confused.</p> </blockquote> <p> The president was clearly irked by the article, posting two tweets this morning branding the publication a \u201cfar left magazine\u201d and arguing he has done \u201cmore for the evangelical community\u201d than any other president in history. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1207997319821615105\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">....have a Radical Left nonbeliever, who wants to take your religion &amp; your guns, than Donald Trump as your President.

Here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s major stories: Nancy Pelosi made a point to emphasize in an interview that Trump would go down in history as an impeached president. \u201cHe\u2019ll be impeached for ever,\u201d the House speaker said. \u201cNo matter what the Senate does. He\u2019s impeached for ever because he violated our Constitution.\u201d Trump accepted the House speaker\u2019s invitation to deliver his annual state of the union address on Feb. 4, one day after the Democratic presidential caucuses in Iowa. The timing also means the president will likely speak to Congress shortly after being acquitted in a Senate impeachment trial. Trump suggested Pelosi should be impeached for holding back the articles of impeachment from the Senate, even though members of Congress cannot be impeached. The Democratic national committee announced the requirements to qualify for the January debate, which could eliminate all but five candidates \u2013 Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar \u2013 from the debate stage. Trump continued to lash out against Christianity Today after the evangelical magazine suggested the president should be removed from office. The inspector general for the Department of Homeland Security said immigration agents had not engaged in \u201cmisconduct or malfeasance\u201d regarding the deaths in custody of two migrant children last December. Bernie Sanders spoke with my colleague Sam Levin this morning, and reiterated his critique of Pete Buttigieg, Joe Biden and billionaires: They will tell you, \u2018It doesn\u2019t impact me. It really doesn\u2019t mean anything to me.\u2019 That is clearly nonsensical. Why would billionaires and wealthy people be making large contributions if it didn\u2019t mean something to them? The Vermont senator also addressed concerns that his nomination could lead to a Democratic defeat similar to that of Jeremy Corbyn and the British Labour party\u2019s recent shellacking: The United Kingdom, last I heard, is not the United States. Brexit is not a major part of what this campaign is about. The issues that I am campaigning on, in fact, are precisely the issues the American people support. Talk about raising the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour. Four years ago when I introduced that concept, it was a radical idea. Not radical anymore. Read the full interview here. It\u2019s the Friday afternoon before Christmas, so please forgive me for sharing this article, a startlingly in-depth investigation into the most dedicated editor of the Wikipedia page of Pete Buttigieg. Another interesting report from the Washington Post: over the past few days, the White House threatened to veto the year-end spending package necessary to avert a government shutdown before Saturday unless the House dropped language about military aid for Ukraine. Per the Post: The Ukraine provision was one of several items the White House drew a hard line on during negotiations to finalize the spending legislation, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the developments. It would have required the White House to swiftly release $250 million in defense money for Ukraine that was part of the spending package. The White House this year refused to release congressionally appropriated defense aid to Kyiv during a period when President Trump had asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former vice president and 2020 candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who had served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. Trump\u2019s request of Zelensky as the White House delayed the aid was at the heart of House Democrats\u2019 decision to impeach Trump this week on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Read the whole report here. White House aide Stephen Miller has pushed to embed ICE agents in the Office of Refugee Resettlement, in apparent circumvention of federal laws, the Washington Post reports. Unaccompanied migrant children are cared for by the ORR, which is part of the department of health and human services (HHS), and congress has passed laws to keep the program separate from deportation enforcement efforts. But after the White House tried and failed to \u201cembed\u201d ICE agents in the agency, it did extract a concession from HHS: They agreed to allow Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to collect fingerprints and other biometric information from adults seeking to claim migrant children at government shelters. If those adults are deemed ineligible to take custody of a child, ICE could then use their information to target them for arrest and deportation. Read the rest of the Washington Post\u2019s report here. The inspector general for the Department of Homeland Security found no \u201cmisconduct or malfeasance\u201d in the deaths of two migrant children last December, according to BuzzFeed News. Jakelin Caal Maquin, 7, and Felipe G\u00f3mez Alonzo, 8, died in US custody last winter after crossing the border with their fathers and being detained by Customs and Border Protection. Both died from infections that led to sepsis, according to the report. Last week, CBP refused to allow a group of doctors in San Diego access to detained migrant children to provide them with flu vaccines. CBP has said that it only detains children for less than 72 hours, making medical services unnecessary, but government records have shown children and adults held for longer. Since we already had Jane Lynch, it seems only fair to check in on the rest of the day\u2019s weird celebrity/politician match-ups... Jack Nicholson was spotted at a Bernie Sanders rally: And here\u2019s an image that will set Hacker News aflame ... Speaking of billionaires... the two billionaire candidates in the Democratic presidential primary spent about $15m on television ads in California in advance of yesterday\u2019s debate, my colleague Sam Levin reports. What could you do with that kind of money in a state with 59,000 homeless residents? Well, house some of them, to start. Rev Andy Bales of the Union Rescue Mission told Sam that $15m could provide immediate if temporary shelter for approximately 1,800 homeless people from LA\u2019s Skid Row. Alternatively, that kind of money could fund 30 new units of supportive housing, providing longterm housing for about 50 people. Read the rest of Sam\u2019s report here. The Trump campaign will not be, well, turning the other cheek on this one. Hello everyone! This is Julia Carrie Wong, reporting in from a wine cave somewhere north of San Francisco where I\u2019ve been hanging out with my good pal Jane Lynch. Is she joking? Is she serious? It\u2019s hard to tell, but according to a quick search of federal elections filings, a Jane Lynch who lists her profession as actor and residence as Los Angeles has made the following donations to presidential campaigns this year: $2700 to Pete Buttigieg, $100 to Elizabeth Warren, and $100 to Marianne Williamson. That\u2019s it from me after a historic week in Washington. My west coast colleague, Julia Carrie Wong, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Nancy Pelosi made a point to emphasize in an interview that Trump would go down in history as an impeached president. \u201cHe\u2019ll be impeached for ever,\u201d the House speaker said. \u201cNo matter what the Senate does. He\u2019s impeached for ever because he violated our Constitution.\u201d Trump accepted the House speaker\u2019s invitation to deliver his annual state of the union address on Feb. 4, one day after the Democratic presidential caucuses in Iowa. The timing also means the president will likely speak to Congress shortly after being acquitted in a Senate impeachment trial. Trump suggested Pelosi should be impeached for holding back the articles of impeachment from the Senate, even though members of Congress cannot be impeached. The Democratic national committee announced the requirements to qualify for the January debate, which could eliminate all but five candidates -- Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar -- from the debate stage. Trump continued to lash out against Christianity Today after the evangelical magazine suggested the president should be removed from office. Julia will have much more coming up, so stay tuned. Trump has now sent a tweet suggesting Nancy Pelosi should be impeached as House speaker for holding up the articles of impeachment, even though members of Congress cannot actually be impeached. The Constiution specifies the House can only impeach the \u201cPresident, Vice President and all Civil Officers of the United States,\u201d and the Senate detemined in 1799 that members of Congress do not qualify as \u201cCivil Officers of the United States.\u201d According to Article I, Section 5 of the Constitution, members of Congress can be expelled for \u201cdisorderly behavior\u201d if two-thirds of their colleagues support their removal. But expulsion and impeachment are different mechanisms of removal. Trump just sent a tweet declaring his \u201cFULL Endorsement\u201d for Jeff Van Drew, the congressman who switched his party affiliation to Republican after opposing the president\u2019s impeachment. \u201cSouth Jersey is TRUMP COUNTRY, so I know ALL NJ Republicans will join me in supporting Jeff Van Drew,\u201d the president wrote. The tweet comes one day after Van Drew appeared alongside Trump in the Oval Office and declared his \u201cundying\u201d support for the president, setting off plenty of Twitter heckling. Van Drew won his congressional seat as a Democrat last year with 53% of the vote, so it\u2019s possible the district could change hands. But the Cook Political Report has rated the seat as \u201cLean Republican\u201d following Van Drew\u2019s party switch. Eric Ueland, Trump\u2019s legislative affairs director, said the president is \u201cbaffled\u201d by Nancy Pelosi\u2019s threat to hold back the House-passed articles of impeachment from the Senate. \u201cI think the president is completely baffled at the theory that Nancy Pelosi appears to have that somehow holding back impeachment articles will leverage some sort of specific behavior out of the Senate,\u201d Ueland told CBS News. The legislative affairs director added it would be \u201cconstitutionally questionable\u201d and \u201cextraordinarily unprecedented\u201d if Pelosi held back the articles of impeachment. White House counsel Pat Cipollone had a \u201cbrief conversation\u201d with Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell as he and Trump\u2019s legisaltive affairs director, Eric Ueland, toured Capitol Hill to look at potential locations for the eventual impeachment trial. Shortly after Trump bragged that he has been the best president for \u201creligion itself,\u201d Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg sent this tweet. Buttigieg has often discussed his faith on the campaign trail and has used it to explain his political positions. For example, the Indiana mayor got into a bit of a feud earlier this year with Vice President Mike Pence, who signed a law as governor of the state that LGBTQ advocates feared would allow businesses to discriminate against same-sex couples. \u201cIf me being gay was a choice, it was a choice that was made far, far above my pay grade,\u201d Buttigieg said in April. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the thing I wish the Mike Pences of the world would understand: that if you\u2019ve got a problem with who I am, your problem is not with me. Your quarrel, sir, is with my creator.\u201d Congress has no more votes scheduled before the holidays, but the Senate is already looking ahead to its 2020 business. Senator Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the finance committee, has announced a Jan. 7 markup session for the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, which the House approved yesterday. The Democratic-controlled House approved the bill by a vote of 385 to 41, so it seems likely the Republican-controlled Senate will pass the legislation, which Trump is eager to claim credit for. But at a press conference yesterday, Nancy Pelosi praised the House Democratic caucus for working to get the bill passed. \u201cOf course we\u2019ll take credit for it,\u201d the House speaker said. \u201cIt would have collateral benefit for the president. I don\u2019t care about that. We had an opportunity to do something very important for America\u2019s people.\u201d Trump then lashed out against Pelosi on Twitter -- claiming the House speaker, who oversaw months of negotiations with US trade representative Robert Lighthizer, \u201cdoesn\u2019t even know what [the bill] says.\u201d Two senior Trump advisers, White House counsel Pat Cipollone and legislative affairs director Eric Ueland, are visiting Capitol Hill to view locations where the president\u2019s eventual impeachment trial could take place. \u201cIt will be a good straightforward run-through,\u201d Ueland said. Trump has accepted the House speaker\u2019s invitation and will deliver his annual state of the union address on Feb. 4, one day after the Iowa caucuses. \u201cPresident Donald J. Trump has accepted the Speaker\u2019s invitation to deliver the State of the Union Address on February 4, 2020,\u201d White House spokesperson Hogan Gidley said in a statement. The timing means Trump will likely deliver the annual speech shortly after he is acquitted in a Senate impeachment trial. Joe Biden seems to be taking the high road after Sarah Sanders, Trump\u2019s former press secretary, sent a now-deleted tweet mocking the former vice president for his history of stuttering. During last night\u2019s debate, Biden reflected upon children he has met on the campaign trail who have asked him for help because they also struggle with stuttering. To emphasize the point, Biden did an impression of his own past stutter. Shortly afterwards, Sanders sent a tweet reading, \u201cI I I I I I I I I I I I I I I hhhave absolutely no idea what Biden is talking about.\u201d Biden quickly replied on Twitter, \u201cI\u2019ve worked my whole life to overcome a stutter. And it\u2019s my great honor to mentor kids who have experienced the same. It\u2019s called empathy. Look it up.\u201d Sanders later deleted the tweet and apologized, claiming she did not know about Biden\u2019s history of stuttering. \u201cI actually didn\u2019t know that about you and that is commendable,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI apologize and should have made my point respectfully.\u201d Less than two months after dropping out of the presidential race, Beto O\u2019Rourke has launched a political action group meant to boost Democratic candidates in his home state of Texas. In an email to supporters, O\u2019Rourke said the group, which is called Powered by People, will bring \u201ctogether volunteers from around the state to work on the most important races in Texas.\u201d \u201cPowered by People will organize grassroots volunteers to do the tough, necessary work that wins elections: registering Texans to vote (especially those that have just moved to Texas and those who are just turning 18), knocking on their doors, making phone calls, and connecting the dots so that we all understand that in order to make progress on the issues we care most about \u2014 like gun violence, healthcare and climate \u2014 we will have to register, volunteer and vote,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. It\u2019s worth noting what a historic week it has been for Nancy Pelosi. In less than 48 hours, the House speaker oversaw the impeachment of a president, shepherded through a renegotiated North American trade deal and invited Trump to deliver his state of the union address. Meanwhile, Trump is still stewing over the evangelical magazine Christianity Today calling for his removal from office, claiming he has been the best president for \u201creligion itself.\u201d Despite the magazine\u2019s censure, Trump\u2019s approval rating among white evangelicals, whose support he will need to win reelection, remains very high. Nancy Pelosi\u2019s letter inviting Trump to deliver his state of the union seemed to take on an added meaning considering the House\u2019s vote this week to impeach the president for abusing his power and obstructing Congress. \u201cIn their great wisdom, our Founders crafted a Constitution based on a system of separation of powers: three co-equal branches acting as checks on each other,\u201d the House speaker wrote. \u201cIn the spirit of respecting our Constitution, I invite you to deliver your State of the Union address before a joint session of Congress on Tuesday, February 4, 2020 in the Chamber of the U.S. House of Representatives.\u201d Nancy Pelosi has invited Trump to deliver his annual state of the union address on Feb. 4, one day after the Democratic presidential caucuses in Iowa. The timing of the state of the union also likely means Trump will deliver his remarks shortly after being acquitted in a Senate impeachment trial. Pete Buttigieg\u2019s campaign has just announced an endorsement from actor Kevin Costner, who will introduce the presidential candidate at a town hall in Indianola, Iowa, this Sunday. Costner starred in the 1989 movie \u201cField of Dreams,\u201d which centers on an Iowa corn farmer building a baseball diamond in his fields after hearing a voice saying, \u201cIf you build it, he will come.\u201d This is Joanie Greve in Washington, taking over the blog from Oliver Laughland, and there is some more debate news today following last night\u2019s face-off. The Democratic National Committee has announced the requirements to qualify for the January debate in Des Moines, Iowa, and they could eliminate all but a handful of candidates. According to the requirements, candidates must attract 225,000 donors and hit 5% in at least four national or early-voting state polls. Candidates can also hit 7% in two early-voting state surveys to meet the polling requirement. These heightened thresholds could eliminate everyone from the debate stage except Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar. Tom Steyer and Andrew Yang, who participated in last night\u2019s debate, have not yet met the polling requirement, and there will be few surveys taken over the holidays, complicating their qualification path. Here\u2019s how things stand at lunch: Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, has said she shown Donald Trump \u201cthe power of the gavel\u201d and has impeached the president \u201cforever\u201d. The combative talk comes as Democrats and Republicans in the senate continue to battle out the parameters of a senate trial. Ivanka Trump has defended her father\u2019s relationship with his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani who she described as a \u201creal warrior and a great, great mayor\u201d. Donald Trump is expected to sign a multibillion dollar defense bill later today. Trump also lashed out at Christianity Today, an evangelical newspaper that has called for his impeachment. The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, has told the Associated Press that she has shown the president \u201cthe power of the gavel\u201d by impeaching the president \u201cfor ever\u201d. \u201cHe just got impeached. He\u2019ll be impeached for ever. No matter what the Senate does. He\u2019s impeached for ever because he violated our constitution,\u201d she said during an interview on Thursday that was published today. \u201cIf I did nothing else, he saw the power of the gavel there And it wasn\u2019t me, it was all of our members making their own decision.\u201d She also urged Senate majority leader, the Republican Mitch McConnell, to bring forward votes on the raft of bills passed by Democrats in the House since the 2018 midterms. \u201cAs the election approaches, we would not want these to be election issues, we would like them to be accomplished legislation,\u201d she said. \u201cSo they either pass the bills or pay a price for not passing bills.\u201d Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter and senior advisor, has given a particularly soft interview to CBS News. The full interview won\u2019t air until 29 December, but the outlet have released a partial transcript. There\u2019s not a huge amount of probing in there, but Trump does appear to defend her father\u2019s judgement when it comes to his relationship with his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani. Giuliani is at the centre of the Ukraine scandal for his role in an unorthodox diplomatic back channel tasked with setting up an investigation into Trump\u2019s political rivals in Ukraine, She said: I know Rudy Giuliani in a very different context as one of the greatest mayors in the history of this country and- and a real hero in New York. So that is- that is the experience I\u2019ve had with Rudy for a very long period of time. He\u2019s smart and thoughtful and- and- and a real warrior and was a great- a great mayor. She also said her father is \u201cenergized\u201d by the impeachment process. The president has said that a formal signing of a US trade deal with China is \u201cbeing arranged\u201d after he spoke directly with president Xi Jinping today. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said yesterday that the nations sides would sign the Phase 1 trade pact, which calls for U.S. farm product exports to China to double over the next two years, at the beginning of January. Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau has urged the Trump administration to withhold signing the deal until two Canadian detained in China are released by authorities. Despite the new deal, an analysis by Bloomberg News suggests it will not cover the remaining costs of the ongoing trade war between China and the US, as the majority of tariffs will remain in place. Here\u2019s some more on Washington state representative Matthew Shea, the local politician found to have \u201cparticipated in an act of domestic terrorism against the United States\u201d, according to a report produced for the state legislature. This from Jason Wilson, who has reported on Shea for the Guardian. It was Wilson\u2019s reporting along with other local outlets, that led to the legislature commissioning the investigation: The report further contends that in a document entitled the Biblical Basis for War, Shea \u201cadvocated the replacement of US democracy with a theocracy and the killing of all males who do not agree\u201d. In its conclusion, while commenting that Shea is not an \u201cimminent direct threat \u2026 it is more probable than not that Representative Shea is likely to plan, direct and engage in additional future conflicts that could carry with them significant risk of bloodshed and loss of life\u201d. It adds: \u201cRepresentative Shea presents a present and growing threat of risk to others through political violence.\u201d In response to the report, the Washington Republican state legislative minority leader, JT Wilcox, announced on Twitter that Shea had been suspended from the house Republican caucus. The report was commissioned by the house and produced by an outside agency, the Rampart Group, following reporting from the Guardian and other local and national outlets on Shea\u2019s activities. It says Shea \u201cplanned the 2016 takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge; engaged in the conflict by directing Cows (Coalition of Western States) members and militias in support of the takeover; and traveled to Burns, Oregon, and met with refuge armed occupiers contrary to appeals and warnings from law enforcement and Oregon state elected officials\u201d. You can read more of Jason\u2019s work on this below: Donald Trump has responded to an editorial in the mainstream evangelical news outlet Christianity Today, which called for his removal from office. The outlet was founded in 1956 by the famous evangelical preacher Billy Graham. Graham died in February 2018 and was honored at a US capitol memorial service, where Trump described him as \u201can ambassador for Christ who reminded the world of the power of prayer and the gift of God\u2019s grace.\u201d Graham\u2019s son, Franklin, remains an ardent supporter of the president. But Christianity Today still attracts 4.3 million monthly online reader among a demographic, evangelical Christians, that voted overwhelmingly for Trump. Here\u2019s an excerpt from the editorial: But the facts in this instance are unambiguous: The president of the United States attempted to use his political power to coerce a foreign leader to harass and discredit one of the president\u2019s political opponents. That is not only a violation of the Constitution; more importantly, it is profoundly immoral. The reason many are not shocked about this is that this president has dumbed down the idea of morality in his administration. He has hired and fired a number of people who are now convicted criminals. He himself has admitted to immoral actions in business and his relationship with women, about which he remains proud. His Twitter feed alone\u2014with its habitual string of mischaracterizations, lies, and slanders\u2014is a near perfect example of a human being who is morally lost and confused. The president was clearly irked by the article, posting two tweets this morning branding the publication a \u201cfar left magazine\u201d and arguing he has done \u201cmore for the evangelical community\u201d than any other president in history. Welcome to our live coverage of US politics. Here are some of the stories we\u2019re tracking this morning. Seven of the top Democratic candidates for president took part in the final primary debate of the year last night, which say mayor Pete Buttigeg take the brunt of criticism with weeks left before the first vote. Donald Trump is expected to sign a spending deal today that includes a $738bn defense bill. The package will add funding for the president\u2019s much maligned space force. The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, continue to clash over the next steps in Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment. Pelosi has withheld the two articles of impeachment, passed by the House earlier this week, arguing the majority leader has declined to indicate a fair trial in the Senate. Matthew Shea, a Republican state representative in Washington state, has been suspended from the party caucus after a report prepared by the state legislature found he had participated \u201cin an act of domestic terrorism\u201d.",

Because this parliament is not going to waste the time of the nation in deadlock and division and delay. On Friday of this week this parliament is going to put the withdrawal agreement in the popty ping as we say in Wales, and then this new democratic parliament, this people\u2019s parliament, is going to do something.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>During the election campaign, Johnson claimed to have learned that \u201cpopty ping\u201d was the Welsh for microwave, even <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/32LYRFTf8hSR9xknCxYXl7T/seven-welsh-words-that-are-well-worth-knowing\">though this is apparently a myth</a>. Johnson went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>And Mr Speaker I wonder if you can guess what it is that this parliament is going to do. What is it going to do? I wonder if you can guess what this parliament is going to do once we put the withdrawal agreement back. We are going to get Brexit done and even your parrot, Mr Speaker, would have been able to cite that one by now. </p> \n   <p>And we are going to get on with delivering on the priorities of the British people, transforming the NHS, investing massively in education, in police, uniting and levelling up across the country and across the whole UK. And it is my belief and the belief of most honourable members in this house that we should resist the calls of those who would break up that United Kingdom. And as the parliament of the UK we should politely and respectfully defend that partnership and that union. </p> \n   <p>And I can tell the house that after three and a half years of wrangling and division, we in this government will do whatever we can to reach out across the house to find common ground, to heal the divisions of our country, and to find a new and generous spirit in which we conduct all our political dealings with one another that will last beyond this immediate season of Christmas goodwill.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a628f6b13734a3c0537636f21ab7dca0b11689c1\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a628f6b13734a3c0537636f21ab7dca0b11689c1/84_0_3340_2004/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson speaking in the Commons this afternoon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson speaking in the Commons this afternoon.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: -/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-17T19:14:55.959Z\">at 7.14pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5df90bd18f087e8308e5fd4a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-17T17:21:27.041Z\">5.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Downing Street has announced some new government appointments.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Mike Freer</strong> and <strong>Iain Stewart</strong>, who were both government whips, remain as whips but both get promotions within the whips\u2019 office.

Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s allies, who are rallying behind the shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey as their candidate, argue that agreeing to a second referendum was a mistake (although Long-Bailey herself has yet to express a view on this topic.)</p> \n  <p>The biggest threat to Long-Bailey may come from the candidate attracting most Labour remain supporter, either Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, or Thornberry herself. Both Starmer and Thornberry strongly argued for a second referendum, and said that in such a poll they would back remain.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"86e23a8dd5472a154f87e31491e3219cee83396a\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/86e23a8dd5472a154f87e31491e3219cee83396a/0_34_1322_793/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Emily Thornberry.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emily Thornberry.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yui Mok/PA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-17T09:43:00.860Z\">at 9.43am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5df8933d8f08c3972263bb5e\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-17T09:06:37.244Z\">9.06am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Starmer says Johnson's decision to rule out transition extension 'reckless and irresponsible'</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>On Friday, in a statement in Downing Street after his surprise and overwhelming election victory, <strong>Boris Johnson</strong> offered<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/dec/12/general-election-2019-uk-live-labour-tories-corbyn-boris-johnson-results-exit-poll?page=with:block-5df3aab18f08b5e67004384b#block-5df3aab18f08b5e67004384b\"> an olive branch of sorts to people who voted remain.</a> Addressing specifically those who still wanted to stay in the EU, he said \u201cwe in this one-nation Conservative government will never ignore your good and positive feelings of warmth and sympathy towards the other nations of Europe.\u201d It was hard to know what he meant by that, and this morning many remainers will be concluding \u201cnot much\u201d following the overnight announcement from No 10 that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/16/boris-johnson-will-amend-brexit-bill-to-outlaw-extension\">its new version of the withdrawal agreement bill will ban the government from seeking an extension to the Brexit transition.</a> This is a concession to Brexiters and, although it could be argued that the intention is just to intensify pressure for the UK-EU trade deal to be finalised by the end of 2020, it does raise the prospect of the UK falling out of the transition into a no-deal Brexit this time next year if agreement cannot be reached.</p> \n  <p>That is the conclusion of the financial markets.

          "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from us for this evening. Thanks for reading and commenting. Here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s news: Jeremy Corbyn apologised to his remaining MPs for Labour\u2019s general election defeat. The party\u2019s leader admitted personal responsibility as he faced the parliamentary Labour party on Tuesday evening. Keir Starmer, indicated he was likely to run for the Labour leadership. The shadow Brexit secretary set out his stall in a wide-ranging interview with the Guardian on Tuesday. Barry Gardiner also declined to rule out standing for the deputy leadership. The Conservative party announced a broad-brush review of discrimination after Boris Johnson broke his promise to hold an inquiry specifically into Tory Islamophobia. The party appointed a former equality and human rights commissioner to lead the review. Downing Street warned businesses to prepare for life outside EU\u2019s customs regime \u201cin all circumstances\u201d. The spokesman also refused to comment on the fall in the pound on Tuesday morning, that followed the ruling out of a Brexit extension. You can see a more detailed summary of the lobby briefing with journalists here. Nicola Sturgeon indicated she would not drop her calls for a second Scottish independence referendum. After receiving short shrift from the prime minister, the SNP leader said the vast majority of Scotland had backed either pro-EU or pro-independence parties. She also called for cross-party support for the move. Boris Johnson delivered his first speech to the Commons since the general election. Boris Johnson told MPs he thought this parliament a \u201cvast improvement on its predecessor\u201d. And, if you\u2019d like to read yet more, Zoe Williams and Heather Stewart have tonight\u2019s main story: Keir Starmer has set out his pitch for the Labour leadership with a call for his party not to lurch to the right as a result of last week\u2019s devastating election result, my colleagues Zoe Williams and Heather Stewart write. While the leadership race has not yet formally been launched, the shadow Brexit secretary confirmed to the Guardian that, as widely expected in Westminster, he was \u201cseriously considering\u201d running to succeed Jeremy Corbyn. In a wide-ranging interview, Starmer said Labour did not do enough to tackle the Conservatives\u2019 central election pledge to \u2018get Brexit done\u2019 nor sufficiently deal with antisemitism, and urged his party to return to being a \u201cbroad church\u201d. He insisted Labour could win the next general election; but only if it sticks to its values. There\u2019s no hiding from it. It is a devastating result, but it\u2019s important not to oversteer. The case for a bold and radical Labour government is as strong now as it was last Thursday. We need to anchor ourselves in that. I want trust to be restored in the Labour party as a progressive force for good: and that means we have to win. But there\u2019s no victory without values. There are conflicting reports about whether or not parliamentarians have been calling on Corbyn to quit immediately at this evening\u2019s meeting. The Labour MP, Lloyd Russell-Moyle has said explicitly that there has been no such clamour. But BBC Newsnight\u2019s Nicholas Watt has this: And here\u2019s a little more detail from the meeting: The prime minister has spoken to his Canadian counterpart Justin Trudeau, who congratulated him on his general election win this evening. A No 10 spokeswoman has said: They agreed to continue to work closely together as Commonwealth partners on issues such as girls\u2019 education, climate change and trade. Labour\u2019s Rachel Reeves said she told the meeting the party must radically change and get a leader \u201cthat actually wants to win\u201d. If we want to change the lives of the people we came into politics to serve, then we\u2019ve got to win power and that\u2019s not been possible two times under Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership. We need radical change, we need a party and a leader the country can trust, we need economic policies that add up and we need somebody that actually wants to win because they know that it\u2019s only through power that we can change the lives of people. Jess Phillips, viewed as a possible leadership candidate by some, has played down the ferocity of the PLP meeting, though she said it was largely critical of Corbyn. It was no worse than it always is. It\u2019s just people saying what they think. There are a couple of people being supportive. She said she read a text from Melanie Onn, the former Labour MP who lost her Great Grimsby seat to the Tories, about \u201chow she had been let down by the leadership and the frontbench and that nobody had bothered with Grimsby\u201d. Phillips said: There are lots and lots of complaints about how nobody has called any of the people who lost. However, her Labour colleague Dame Margaret Hodge said Corbyn faced a hostile reaction. She told reporters that \u201con the whole, it was fury, despair, miserable and I just felt that the top table had corporate amnesia\u201d. They talked about vetting new members and everybody laughed. There\u2019s fury that he didn\u2019t go to visit the right constituencies ... there was fury over the level of organisation. Lloyd Russell-Moyle said Labour MPs\u2019 criticism of Corbyn centred on his leadership, his Brexit position and his manifesto for lacking an \u201coverarching narrative\u201d. Not one person said go right now. They all recognise that he has apologised and that he wants to go as soon as possible, and that the duty was to save the party and do it in an orderly way. People were emotional, very emotional. Here\u2019s a little more on Creagh\u2019s comments about Jeremy Corbyn: She told Channel 4 News she had confronted him in Westminster because, in her view, he\u2019d \u201cenabled a hard Brexit\u201d and \u201cfive years of austerity\u201d. Creagh blamed Corbyn for Labour\u2019s losses, adding: \u201cThis was Jeremy\u2019s manifesto [...] Jeremy\u2019s NEC [Labour\u2019s governing body].\u201d She added that the views she\u2019d heard expressed about his policies on the doorsteps could not be broadcast pre-watershed. And she said: In Jeremy, we have a man without honour and without shame. Another Labour MP on his way out of the meeting says Corbyn\u2019s leadership came up time and time again in the meeting. He said Margaret Beckett, who was acting leader after John Smith died, made a particularly noteworthy contribution, saying the leadership should not be worried about protecting its legacy when thinking about a new leader; what mattered was who would be best placed to win, she told the meeting. The MP said several colleagues also said antisemitism had been a problem, and had to be addressed. He acknowledged that some MPs spoke out in support of Corbyn. But, referring to MPs like Claudia Webbe (see 7.15pm), he said people just elected in safe seats were not best placed to understand the party\u2019s problems. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is taking over now. \u201cWell cheerful,\u201d says an MP, ironically, commenting on the mood at PLP on the way out - but then she adds: \u201cIt\u2019s no better or worse than it always is.\u201d Earlier one member of the PLP was complaining about the leader\u2019s office not being in touch with MPs who lost their seats. See 6.53pm.Channel 4 News has had an interview with Mary Creagh, who has been making the same complaint. Creagh lost her seat last week. Another MP mutters \u201cmadness, pure madness\u201d as he walks past journalists after leaving the PLP meeting. On the way out one long-serving MP tells journalists that the meeting consisted of \u201cdreary contributions from the leadership and absolutely no acknowledgment of what went wrong\u201d. More from Paul Waugh Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s comments about being sorry and taking responsibility for Labour\u2019s defeat are significant because, when he spoke at his election count in the early hours of Friday morning, and when he gave a TV interview later in the day, he expressed little contrition over what had happened. But in an open letter in the Sunday Mirror at the weekend he did say he was sorry about the result. However, in a separate article for the Observer, he did not use the word \u201csorry\u201d or \u201capologise\u201d, and just said he regretted what had happened. These are from my colleague Kate Proctor. I didn\u2019t see the Labour peer Stewart Wood go in for the PLP meeting (it\u2019s for peers as well as MPs), but here are his thoughts, in an article for HuffPost, on what Labour needs to do to recover. Wood worked as an adviser to Gordon Brown when he was PM, and then as an adviser to Ed Miliband. The door opens as a peer leaves the room. While it\u2019s open we can hear a woman (I did not recognise her voice) say: Our leadership have not got in touch with many of the MPs ... We have heard quite a few complaints in recent days that Corbyn\u2019s office has not been in touch with MPs who lost their seats. When she finished she got a round of applause. More from HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh, who is ahead of everyone else when it comes to getting updates from inside the room. In some non-Labour news, the Conservatives have announced their long-promised review into discrimination in the party. As expected, it does not focus just on Islamophobia, even though during the leadership contest Boris Johnson appeared to sign up to the idea of an Islamophobia-specific inquiry when Sajid Javid bounced him and other candidates into agreeing to the proposal during a TV debate. Here is an extract from the Conservative party news release. The Conservative party have today announced the appointment of Prof Swaran Singh to lead the independent review into improving party handling of complaints of all forms of discrimination and prejudice, including Islamophobia. This independent review will look at how we can improve our processes \u2013 to make sure that any instances are isolated, and that there are robust processes in place to stamp them out as and when they occur. Until 2019, Professor Singh was a commissioner of the Equality and Human Rights Commission. He is currently the professor of social and community psychiatry at the University of Warwick. Good use of the word \u201csmattering\u201d here from Paul Waugh ... There was some applause for Lavery, but it was relatively short and half-hearted. From my colleague Kate Proctor She\u2019s right. It is Ian Lavery speaking. I am on a bench on the other side of the corridor (colleagues are nearer the door), but even from here I can tell it\u2019s Lavery. But I can\u2019t make out what he\u2019s saying. That seems a good excuse, while we wait, to flag up this recording of Neil Kinnock telling a PLP meeting in 2016 why he thought Jeremy Corbyn should go. This story contains the text of what he said, plus audio. From the Telegraph\u2019s Harry Yorke earlier Another, rather muffled, round of applause ... From HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh (who has a source inside, I presume, rather than excellent hearing) Journalists in the corridor are whispering in the hope of being able to hear better. But we can\u2019t hear what is being said inside. The doors are quite thick, and the doorkeeper is being quite strict about not letting reporters stand too close to them. Now a burst of laughter from inside ... One of the Commons doorkeepers has just come past asking journalists to stand \u201caway from the door\u201d. The meeting has started. From the corridor we cannot hear what is being said, but we can hear applause. We\u2019ve had two bursts of applause so far. I\u2019m outside committee room 14 in the House of Commons, where the PLP (parliamentary Labour party) is holding its first meeting since the general election. The meeting is due to start, and it seems to be standing room only inside. Jeremy Corbyn has already gone in. Outside there are around two dozen journalists. Here is the substance of what Boris Johnson told MPs earlier. It was only a very short speech, but it was his first as prime minister to the House of Commons, and he used it to deliver a message about his agenda. He told MPs: I don\u2019t know about you, Mr Speaker elect, but as you survey this house from your eminence, with a characteristic beam that has brought you such deserved popularity, I don\u2019t know what you think but I mean absolutely no disrespect to those who are no longer with us \u2013 but I think this parliament is a vast improvement on its predecessor. And indeed Mr Speaker, I would say it is one of the best parliaments this country has ever produced. with more female members than ever before, with more black and minority ethnic members than ever before, and it is also Mr Speaker \u2013 incarnated in your person \u2013 a vastly more democratic parliament. Because this parliament is not going to waste the time of the nation in deadlock and division and delay. On Friday of this week this parliament is going to put the withdrawal agreement in the popty ping as we say in Wales, and then this new democratic parliament, this people\u2019s parliament, is going to do something. During the election campaign, Johnson claimed to have learned that \u201cpopty ping\u201d was the Welsh for microwave, even though this is apparently a myth. Johnson went on: And Mr Speaker I wonder if you can guess what it is that this parliament is going to do. What is it going to do? I wonder if you can guess what this parliament is going to do once we put the withdrawal agreement back. We are going to get Brexit done and even your parrot, Mr Speaker, would have been able to cite that one by now. And we are going to get on with delivering on the priorities of the British people, transforming the NHS, investing massively in education, in police, uniting and levelling up across the country and across the whole UK. And it is my belief and the belief of most honourable members in this house that we should resist the calls of those who would break up that United Kingdom. And as the parliament of the UK we should politely and respectfully defend that partnership and that union. And I can tell the house that after three and a half years of wrangling and division, we in this government will do whatever we can to reach out across the house to find common ground, to heal the divisions of our country, and to find a new and generous spirit in which we conduct all our political dealings with one another that will last beyond this immediate season of Christmas goodwill. Downing Street has announced some new government appointments. Mike Freer and Iain Stewart, who were both government whips, remain as whips but both get promotions within the whips\u2019 office. Freer moves up to Comptroller HM Household, and Stewart moves up to Lord Commissioner of HM Treasury. Nusrat Ghani becomes a full junior transport minister. Previously she had a paid job as a whip which she combined with an unpaid job as transport minister. Now she gets a salary for her transport post. (There is a legal limit to how many paid ministers a PM can have in government.) Douglas Ross becomes an unpaid Scotland Office minister, combining that with being an unpaid whip. Maria Caulfield becomes a government whip. On the subject of the Tories and anti-elitism, the polling company YouGov has published some research today looking at which groups voted for which parties. It suggests that, at least on the basis of where their support comes from, the Conservatives can now claim to be more of a working class party than a middle class party. It says: The Conservatives comfortably outperformed Labour across all social grades, further evidence that class is no longer a key indicator of how people vote. In fact, the Conservatives actually did better amongst C2DE voters (48%) than they did amongst ABC1 voters (43%). Labour performed the same amongst both social grade groups (33%). Lord Ashcroft published some separate polling on Friday that came to much the same conclusion. For much of the 20th century Labour was the party of the working class and the Conservatives were the party of the middle class. In recent years, class stopped being the main determinant of voting behaviour (age and education are now the key factors), but even in 2017 Labour was still doing better, proportionally, among working class voters than among middle class voters. The fact that it is the Conservatives who are now doing better, proportionally, with this demographic potentially has huge implications, and it helps to explain why Boris Johnson has been so keen to argue that he is no longer leading \u201cthe Tory party of the old days\u201d and that instead it\u2019s a \u201ctotally different party\u201d. A Downing Street source has confirmed that Boris Johnson and his ministers will not be attending the Davos World Economic Forum this year. The source implied that this was more to do with the government wanting to focus on getting Brexit done, than it wanting to burnish its populist credentials by snubbing the annual gather for the global financial elite, although one suspects No 10 would not mind too much if the move were reported that way. In the Commons MPs are now swearing the oath of allegiance, one by one. Before the process started, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, told them they would be unable to speak or vote in debates until they were sworn in - and that they could not get paid either. MPs take the oath in order of seniority. The whole process may not finish until Thursday. Here is the full text of Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s statement to the Scottish parliament earlier. And here are the main points she made. Sturgeon said that, particularly in the light of the election result, taking Scotland out of the EU against its will was \u201ccompletely and utterly unsustainable\u201d. The election was comprehensively won in Scotland by the SNP ... In fact, the Conservatives have now lost 17 consecutive Westminster elections in Scotland \u2013 stretching back to 1959. But in spite of that, we face a majority Tory government implementing a manifesto that Scotland rejected. Furthermore, 74% of votes in Scotland were cast for parties that either supported remaining in the EU or were in favour of a second EU referendum. 90% of seats were won by pro EU or pro EU referendum parties. But regardless, we are set to be dragged out of the EU against our will. Such a democratic deficit is not just undesirable, it is also completely and utterly unsustainable. She said later this week she would publish an argument as to why the Scottish government should have the right to call an independence referendum. It is essential therefore that a future outside of Europe and governed by an increasingly right wing Conservative government is not foisted upon Scotland. Instead, we must have the right to consider the alternative of independence. That is why, later this week, in line with repeated election mandates \u2013 reinforced once again on Thursday \u2013 I will publish the detailed democratic case for a transfer of power from Westminster to this parliament to allow for an independence referendum that is beyond legal challenge. This parliament will also vote on the final stage of the referendums (Scotland) bill which puts in place the framework for a future referendum. She said she hoped there would be cross-party support for this proposal. A new, Brexit focused Tory government presents risks that few would have predicted at the dawn of devolution. So I hope in the coming days and weeks we will see a similar coming together around the idea of Scotland\u2019s right to choose a better future. She said the delay in the UK budget caused problems for the Scottish government. This parliament is required to deliver a budget before the start of the next financial year, and Scotland\u2019s local authorities would expect to set their budgets in late February or early March. At this point, the UK government has not confirmed when it will produce its own budget \u2013 and with it the block grant adjustments for Scotland \u2013 but it may not be until March. While contingency planning and alternative options have been under consideration for some time, meeting this timetable will require parties to work together. From ITV\u2019s political editor Robert Peston Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, has told Euronews\u2019 Darren McCaffrey that the EU will do \u201cthe maximum\u201d to ensure that the UK and the EU can conclude their future partnership negotiation by the end of next year. In the Commons the sitting has been suspended. Later MPs will return to start swearing in. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, says he is pleased to congratulate Lindsay Hoyle on behalf of the expanded SNP group in the Commons. And Sir Ed Davey, the acting Lib Dem leader, says that if Britain had a proportional representation system, his group would be the third largest, with 70 MPs. He says he hopes Hoyle will bear this in mind. Corbyn congratulates new MPs. He says all MPs represent a community. That is a strength of the Commons. He says a majority of Labour MPs are now women. And 20 of the 26 new Labour MPs are women, he says. He says he hopes the Speaker will continue to take the mental health of MPs seriously. He finishes by urging Lindsay Hoyle to stand firm against abuses by the executive. In doing so, he will be standing up not just for MPs, but for the people they represent. Democracy is not a given. It is something we have to defend and extend. Jeremy Corbyn is speaking now. He joins Johnson in recalling the London Bridge terror attack. He says MPs should remember what David Merritt said about his son Jack, who was killed on that day. He congratulates Johnson on winning the election. And he pays tribute to Labour MPs who lost their seats, particularly Dennis Skinner. Corbyn says Johnson will be judged by whether he keeps his promises. And he says Labour will hold the government to account. Boris Johnson is speaking now. He is opening a short session allowing party leaders to congratulate Sir Lindsay Hoyle. Johnson says this parliament \u201cis a vast improvement on its predecessor\u201d. In fact, it is one of the best this country has produced. It has more female MPs than ever before and more BAME MPs than ever before. And it is more democratic, he says. He says this parliament is going to pass the withdrawal bill. And he invites the Speaker to guess what parliament will do: it will \u201cget Brexit done\u201d, he says. He says even Hoyle\u2019s parrot (Hoyle has a menagerie of pets, mostly named after parliamentarians) would have guessed that. He says the government will do whatever it can to reach out across the House, to find common ground and to heal the divisions facing this country. MPs have passed the motion by acclamation. Sir Lindsay Hoyle is taking the chair. There is now a mini-debate on the motion to approve Sir Lindsay Hoyle as Speaker. Labour\u2019s Lisa Nandy is proposing the motion. She says new MPs will find out out how friendly and supportive he can be. Joking about his taste for Yorkshire tea, she tells an anecdote about how Hoyle (a proud Lancastrian) once said there were only two good things about Yorkshire; its tea, and the M62 leading out of it. She says in the Speaker\u2019s chair (he was deputy Speaker before his promotion) Hoyle has always been fair and unpartisan. In the Commons MPs have just been to the Lords chamber and back to hear a royal commission instruct them to elect a Speaker. Sir Peter Bottomley, the father of the Commons, is chairing proceedings and he proposes the election of Sir Lindsay Hoyle as Speaker. (Or re-election - Hoyle was first elected at the end of the last parliament.) Hoyle says he has served two days as Speaker. It made his election a lot easier, he says. (He represents what was a relatively marginal seat.) He says it will be a privilege to serve as Speaker. He promises to be fair. In his speech at dawn on Friday Boris Johnson said he hoped that Steve Bray, the anti-Brexit campaign best known for his costume and for shouting \u201cStop Brexit\u201d loudly outside the Houses of Parliament on a regular basis, would finally call it a day. Johnson told a Tory audience. And I say respectfully to our stentorian friend in the blue, twelve-star hat: \u2018That\u2019s it, time to put a sock in the megaphone, and give everybody some peace.\u2019 Bray doesn\u2019t seem to be taking much notice. He is outside parliament today, and he\u2019s been shouting too. From the Daily Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar Experts from the Centre for European Reform thinktank have been giving interviews today about the government\u2019s decision to rule out an extension to the Brexit transition period. Sam Lowe, a trade specialist at the CER, described it as \u201cdomestic virtue signalling\u201d. And Charles Grant, the CER\u2019s director, said that if Boris Johnson refuses to be bound by EU regulations, getting a trade deal will become much more complicated. From the Daily Mail\u2019s Jason Groves Back in London MPs are in the Commons chamber for the election of Speaker. The chamber is more or less packed, although at the back row on the opposition benches there are empty seats. Sturgeon says this is a watershed moment for Scotland. Later this week she will take the next steps to secure Scotland\u2019s right to choose its future, she says. Sturgeon has now finished. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, is making a statement to the Scottish parliament. She says the SNP comprehensively won the election. The Conservatives have successfully lost 17 elections in Scotland, she says, going back to 1959. She says that 90% of seats in Scotland were won by pro-EU or pro-referendum parties. She says this situation is \u201cnot just undesirable\u201d but \u201ccompletely and utterly unsustainable\u201d. She says she is pressing ahead with her call for the right to hold a second referendum. Referring to Scottish Labour, she says there are some signs that people opposed to a second independence referendum are changing their minds. But she says she accepts that favouring a second referendum is not the same as favouring independence. And she says that she accepts some SNP voters do not back independence. The Copeland MP Trudy Harrison has been appointed Boris Johnson\u2019s parliamentary private secretary, the BBC\u2019s Richard Moss reports. Mairead McGuinness, first vice-president of the European parliament and an MEP for Ireland\u2019s Fine Gael party, told the World at One that EU insiders were \u201ccautious\u201d about whether it would be possible to negotiate the UK-EU future partnership by the end of next year, as Boris Johnson wants. Asked if this timescale was realistic, she said: All things are possible, but we are all a bit cautious about whether it can effectively be completed within an 11-month period ... From the European Union side we know it is a long stretch to complete everything in 11 months, and I think all negotiators involved in trade will say that. It really then comes down to what the United Kingdom wants to achieve in that period of time, and that we don\u2019t know entirely yet because the negotiations have not begun. She also said that including provisions in the withdrawal agreement bill to rule out an extension to the Brexit transition amounted to going back on the withdrawal agreement Boris Johnson negotiated with the EU, because that did include provisions for a possible extension, but she implied she did not see this as a problem. An estimated 800,000 EU citizens in the UK have yet to apply to remain in the country after Brexit, new Home Office figures suggest. And around 900,000 EU citizens who have already applied to stay will have to apply again because they have been granted temporary leave to remain, known as \u201cpre-settled status\u201d. This is granted to applicants who have been in the country for fewer than five years or those whom Home Office deems not to have sufficient evidence of being in the country for five years or more. Today\u2019s Home Office figures (pdf) show 2.6m applications for settled status have been made so far, but the government estimates there are around 3.4 million EU citizens in the UK. The Home Office minister Brandon Lewis said: EU citizens have made an enormous contribution to the UK and we want them to stay. 2.6 million applications to the EU settlement scheme have already been submitted and I encourage people to keep applying. EU citizens have until at least 31 December 2020 to apply to remain in the country post-Brexit. The Home Office said in its statement it had completed the process on 2.2m applications, leaving a backlog of 400,000 applications. It also said it had granted status to 305,600 EU citizens in November, showing how efficiently it can deal with straightforward applications. Of concern to lawyers and academics monitoring the process will be the high proportion granted pre-settled status. Of the 2.2m applications already concluded, 41% (around 900,000) were granted this status. Barristers, including the immigration specialist Colin Yeo, have raised concerns that some EU citizens may be entitled to settled status but accept pre-settled status for convenience even though it limits their rights. These are from Darren McCaffrey from Euronews. He is quoting Philippe Lamberts, a Belgian MEP, co-leader of the Greens-European Free Alliance and a member of the European parliament\u2019s Brexit steering group. Boris Johnson\u2019s plan to make it illegal for the government to extend the Brexit transition period beyond 11 months has been described as \u201cstrange\u201d by Simon Coveney, Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister, my colleague Daniel Boffey reports. And here are some more lines from the No 10 lobby briefing. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman said that, as well as ruling out an extension to the Brexit transition, the government was also ruling out having a transition after December 2020 to allow time for new UK-EU trading arrangements agreed in the future partnership deal to be implemented. When asked if this could happen, the spokesman replied: I don\u2019t believe that is the case. The prime minister is absolutely clear that the implementation period is not going to be extended. The spokesman said businesses should prepare for the fact that the UK will be leaving the customs union and the single market. He said: In all circumstances we are leaving the single market and customs union, which means we are leaving the EU regime which is associated with that. Businesses will need to prepare for life outside the EU\u2019s customs regime in all circumstances. The spokesman refused to comment on the fall in the pound this morning, in the light of the announcement about an extension to the transition being ruled out (see 9.06am), saying No 10 did not comment on currency fluctuations on principle. The spokesman said some new non-cabinet government appointments would be announced this afternoon. These are appointments to fill gaps created by MPs leaving parliament. I\u2019m just back from the Downing Street lobby briefing. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman said Johnson had a conversation this morning with Ursula von der Leyen, the new president of the European commission. The spokesman said: The president congratulated the prime minister on his success in the election and they agreed to work together with great energy to agree a future partnership by December 2020. Asked if Von der Leyen expressed any doubts about whether it would be possible to conclude the UK-EU trade deal by the end of next year, the spokesman said both sides had agreed in the political declaration that they should reach an agreement on the future partnership by the end of of next year. Von der Leyen has tweeted about the call, but in her tweet she did not say anything about wrapping up the talks by the end of next year. A survey of LabourList readers has Rebecca Long-Bailey very narrowly ahead of Sir Keir Starmer as the favourite candidate for next Labour leader. Angela Rayner, who is now not expected to run, is in third place. Almost 20,000 people took part, but this is a self-selecting survey of readers who may not be party members and who may not have a vote in the contest, and so it would be unwise to read too much into its findings. Polling companies find it hard to poll members of a particular political party, but YouGov has carried out polls of Labour members and its research in 2016 provided a reasonably good guide to the outcome of that year\u2019s leadership contest. In July this year YouGov did survey more than 1,000 Labour members and ask them who would make a good leader. Starmer, John McDonnell and Emily Thornberry came out top. Here are the figures. I\u2019m off to the No 10 lobby briefing now. I will post again after 12.30pm. At least two bookmakers have sent out press releases today about the odds they are offering on the next Labour leader, with Rebecca Long-Bailey the favourite, followed by Lisa Nandy and then Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary. Starmer\u2019s opponents, as well as criticising his stance on Brexit, have been arguing that the next leader should be a woman, as well as an MP from outside London. But Jenny Chapman, who worked for Starmer in the shadow Brexit team and who lost her Darlington seat in the election, has been giving interviews today saying saying gender and regional background should be not factors in the contest. She made this argument in an article for the Daily Mirror and she told the Today programme: I spent the last couple of months talking to folks on the doorstep in Darlington and getting very clear messages back, as you can imagine. What people are saying is that they want a leader that they feel could be the prime minister. It was about, \u2018do I trust this person with my mortgage, with the future, with my children, with my pension?\u2019 And I think that Keir has the qualities that they\u2019re looking for. Nobody on doorsteps of Darlington said the next leader has to have ovaries or a northern accent, and I think that\u2019s such a patronising attitude to think that presenting someone who speaks the northern accent means you\u2019re going to win support in the north. Barry Gardiner, the shadow international trade secretary, has been on BBC News this morning. There were two interesting lines in his interview. Gardiner hinted that Labour would vote against the withdrawal agreement bill if the government holds a second reading vote on Friday. He said that the decision to remove provisions protecting workers\u2019 rights from the bill (see 9.37am) would make it even less attractive than the original version of the bill, that Labour opposed in October. He said: The withdrawal agreement, if it is now countenancing the rights and protections which the previous agreement, which did get a majority in parliament contained within it, the protection for workers\u2019 rights and the protections for the environment, given that [Boris Johnson] is now taking that out, is something that is less attractive to us as a party than even the one before. Gardiner did not rule out standing for the Labour deputy leadership. Asked if he would be a candidate, as some reports have suggested, he replied: I have not made any decision on that at all ... It is speculation. In an interview for the Today programme this morning Andy Burnham, the Labour mayor of Greater Manchester and Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s main rival in the 2015 leadership contest, said that the party\u2019s Brexit policy was a problem at the election. He explained: We\u2019ve always been a coalition between traditional supporting working class communities and let\u2019s say a university-educated liberal left. Labour has not been speaking to both sides of that coalition for some time. And, actually, with the position taken on Brexit at the recent election, it was almost as if they were thwarting the views of people who had been our traditional supporters. Labour has got to speak to both sides of that coalition. Burnham refused to say which candidate he would be backing in the forthcoming leadership contest. He also said that voters in the north should be \u201cwary\u201d of accepting Boris Johnson\u2019s promises, saying that the PM could not simply offer infrastructure improvements that were \u201cdecades away\u201d to keep his new northern voters on side. He said: The north definitely does need new infrastructure. The rail chaos \u2013 that we see this morning even, with more cancellations across the north \u2013 is due to Victorian infrastructure more than anything. But they can\u2019t say that they are doing everything to the north by simply promising infrastructure in the distant future. They have got to deal with the here and now. More than 140,000 EU citizens applied last month to live and work in the UK after Brexit, PAA Media reports. The Home Office said it received 142,300 applications for the EU settlement scheme in November, compared with more than half a million submitted in the previous month. This takes the total number received by the end of November to almost 2.6 million (2,592,800). Overall, the number of applications finalised in that time was more than 2.2 million (2,230,900), according to the Home Office figures (pdf). Of these, 59% were granted permanent leave to remain in the country, called settled status, and 41% were granted pre-settled status \u2013 which means they have temporary leave to remain and would need to apply again for permanent permission at a later date. Sky News has just broadcast some footage of Boris Johnson addressing cabinet for the first time. He told his ministers: The voters of this country have changed this government and our party for the better, and we must repay their trust now by working flat out to change our country for the better. And we should have absolutely no embarrassment about saying we are a people\u2019s government, this is a people\u2019s cabinet, and we are going to be working on delivering the priorities of the British people. And that\u2019s what they want us to do. And we must recognise that people lent us their votes at this election. It was a quite extraordinary, it was a seismic election, but we need to repay their trust and work 24 hours a day, work flat out, to deliver. Of course, the first 100 days were very busy - 140 days, or whatever it was; you may remember it was a very frenetic time \u2013 but you ain\u2019t seen nothing yet, folks. We are going to have to work even harder, because people have a high level of expectation, and we must deliver for them. At this point, treating the cabinet like a bit like a primary school class, Johnson asked his colleagues how many new hospitals they were going to build. Forty, they chanted back at him. (No one was brave enough to point out that it would be more accurate to say just six.) Johnson also asked them to tell him how many new nurses they would hire, and new police officers they would recruit. Then he went on: But there is a huge, huge agenda of delivering social justice, of addressing every problem from social care to homelessness, to levelling up and uniting across our country, with better infrastructure, better education and technology. That\u2019s what we want to do. We are Conservatives; we believe in extending opportunity across the whole of the United Kingdom, and that is what we are going to devote ourselves to. Johnson ended his opening statement by referring to today\u2019s employment figures (see 9.53am), joking about taking the risk of \u201csounding more North Korean than normal\u201d. The economy continued to be robust, he said, but the government would take steps to strengthen it. \u201cYou ain\u2019t seen nothing yet\u201d was a Ronald Reagan catchphrase, and Johnson may have been quoting him deliberately. Reagan drew the political map of American by winning the support of blue-collar workers who had previously voted for the other party (\u201cReagan Democrats\u201d) and, although seen as a leader with a poor grasp of detail, he exuded can-do optimism, which people seemed to like. The government has repeatedly said that it does not intend to lower standards on workers\u2019 rights, consumer rights or environmental protection after Brexit. (See 9.37am.) The EU will also wants to ensure that it does not get undercut by the UK in the future, but a key issue in the UK-EU trade talks will be what rules are agreed to ensure this happens. In an interview on the Today programme this morning Liam Fox, the former Conservative international trade secretary, admitted that the EU would start by pushing for \u201cdynamic alignment\u201d - an agreement that, when the EU tightens standards, the UK would follow suit. But Fox argued that, internationally, this sort of approach was going out of fashion. He explained: There\u2019s a wider debate here, and this discussion is part of it. At the WTO meeting in Buenos Aires there was quite a debate about how do we take forward global trade. Is it by aligning all our regulations? That\u2019s what the EU would call harmonisation, a very legalistic model. Or do we go for outcome-based equivalence? In other words, we agree what the standards and outcomes should look like, but we can find our own way, in our own laws and regulations, to get there. That\u2019s the wider debate. The EU very much favours that very legalistic model. The rest of the world favours a more flexible model. Fox was also asked if he thought the NHS would be at risk from a trade deal with the US. He said there was no chance of this whatsoever and that this was a \u201cred herring\u201d that had been dismissed as such by the voters. He said it was now the \u201cnorm\u201d to insert \u201cexemption clauses\u201d into trade deals to protect the running of public services. He went on: That is the norm now, and we have always said that the Government will retain its right to regulate public services in the national interest. That\u2019s what we said in the election. That\u2019s what we will do. What the Labour Party said about the NHS was a lie then, and it\u2019s irrelevant now. During his round of interviews this morning Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, also insisted that the government would protect employment rights when the UK left the EU. He said a bill to this effect would be in the Queen\u2019s speech on Thursday. This is from the Mirror\u2019s Dan Bloom. UK unemployment dropped to its lowest level in 44 years in the three months to October, as the number of unemployed women hit a record low, PA Media reports. However, the reduction in unemployment came as wage growth stalled over the period and the number of job vacancies also shrank. The number of people claiming unemployment benefits decreased by 13,000 to 1.28 million for the quarter, the Office for National Statistics said. It meant the rate of unemployment stayed flat at 3.8%, surpassing analyst expectations, which had forecast an increase to a 3.9% rate of unemployment. This was largely driven by a decrease in the unemployment rate for women, which fell to a record low of 3.5% for the period. Meanwhile, the number of people in work increased by 24,000 to 32.8 million for the quarter, while the proportion of people in employment stayed flat at 76.2%. Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, has been giving interviews this morning (although not to the Today programme, which is still subject to a No 10 ministerial boycott). As my colleague Kate Proctor reports, on BBC Breakfast Gove refused to explicitly rule out a no-deal Brexit at the end of the transition - although he repeatedly insisted that this was not something people needed to worry about anyway, because both sides were committed to reaching a deal before the end of next year. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, has said that it was a mistake for Jeremy Corbyn not to say what side he would take in the second referendum Labour was planning to hold on Brexit. In an interview with the BBC\u2019s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, recorded during the Labour conference in September and broadcast in Kuenssberg\u2019s documentary, The Brexit Storm Continues, going out tonight, Thornberry said: I think Jeremy is trying to find a compromise but if he goes into an election saying \u2018I don\u2019t have a view\u2019 on the single biggest decision that we have to make \u2013 I think \u2013 what worries me is that every single interview he does will all be about Brexit. Asked if Labour could win if Corbyn adopted that position, Thornberry said: Well, I think it makes it more difficult and that\u2019s why I\u2019m really pushing this because I want Jeremy in No 10. Thornberry also said she wanted Labour to be more overtly pro-remain. At the time Corbyn was refusing to say which side he would back in a second referendum. During the election campaign he refined his position, saying he was taking a deliberate decision in advance to stay neutral. Thornberry is likely to stand for the Labour leadership and Brexit is likely to be a key issue in that context. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s allies, who are rallying behind the shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey as their candidate, argue that agreeing to a second referendum was a mistake (although Long-Bailey herself has yet to express a view on this topic.) The biggest threat to Long-Bailey may come from the candidate attracting most Labour remain supporter, either Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, or Thornberry herself. Both Starmer and Thornberry strongly argued for a second referendum, and said that in such a poll they would back remain. On Friday, in a statement in Downing Street after his surprise and overwhelming election victory, Boris Johnson offered an olive branch of sorts to people who voted remain. Addressing specifically those who still wanted to stay in the EU, he said \u201cwe in this one-nation Conservative government will never ignore your good and positive feelings of warmth and sympathy towards the other nations of Europe.\u201d It was hard to know what he meant by that, and this morning many remainers will be concluding \u201cnot much\u201d following the overnight announcement from No 10 that its new version of the withdrawal agreement bill will ban the government from seeking an extension to the Brexit transition. This is a concession to Brexiters and, although it could be argued that the intention is just to intensify pressure for the UK-EU trade deal to be finalised by the end of 2020, it does raise the prospect of the UK falling out of the transition into a no-deal Brexit this time next year if agreement cannot be reached. That is the conclusion of the financial markets. The pound has been falling this morning, wiping out all the gains it made after the election result was announced. This is from the BBC\u2019s economics editor Faisal Islam. My colleague Graeme Wearden has full coverage on his business live blog. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, has condemned the government\u2019s move, saying that it is \u201creckless and irresponsible\u201d and will put jobs at risk. The government wants to hold a vote on the second reading of the withdrawal agreement bill on Friday. Starmer\u2019s comment implies that Labour will vote against it, but the party\u2019s election defeat has opened an intense debate about its Brexit position and others in the party will be arguing that the party should not vote against the bill at second reading. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Boris Johnson chairs a political cabinet, followed by a normal cabinet meeting. 12pm: Downing Street lobby briefing. After 2pm: Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, is due to address the Scottish parliament about the consequences of the election. 2.30pm: The Commons assembles for the first time since the election. MPs will re-elect Sir Lindsay Hoyle as Speaker, and then the swearing-in of MPs starts. 6pm: Jeremy Corbyn is due to address the parliamentary Labour party. The shadow cabinet is also due to meet at some point this morning. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. We plan to publish a summary at the end of the day. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

          "body": "<p>Now that the House judiciary committee has approved the articles of impeachment against Donald Trump, Republicans have prepared a quiz meant to test Republican lawmakers\u2019 support for the president. Following are excerpts from the Republican quiz.</p> <p><strong>1. The term \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d in the US </strong><strong>constitution\u2019s impeachment clause refers to:</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>A. Acts grossly incompatible with the proper function of the office of the presidency such as using the power of the office for personal gain, whether or not such acts are in violation of a specific criminal statute.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>B. Conduct that satisfies Answer A, but that clearly also violates a criminal statute.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>C. Bill Clinton</p> <p>D. Bill and/or Hillary Clinton</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>2. In creating the impeachment process, the founders meant to show:</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>A. No one is above the law, including the president.</p> <p>B. No one is above the law, but the president should get to decide that for himself.</p> <p>C. No one is above the law, but the president is the law, so where\u2019s the problem?</p> <p>D. This is a sad example of a hyper-partisan question drafted by witch-hunting haters.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>3. President Trump\u2019s 25 July </strong><strong>phone conversation with President Zelen</strong><strong>skiy was</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>A. Manifestly unethical.</p> <p>B. Perfect.</p> <p>C. Not perfect, but pretty darn good.</p> <p>D. Quite problematic, but it didn\u2019t happen.</p> <p>E. Still better than his conversations with Angela Merkel, Emmanuel Macron, Boris Johnson and Justin Trudeau.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>4. In withholding $400</strong><strong>m</strong><strong> in military aid to Ukraine appropriated by Congress, President Trump was:</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>A. Transparently trying to force the newly elected president of a fledgling democracy to participate in a corrupt act.</p> <p>B. Waiting for President Zelenskiy to visit him at the White House so he could hand him the aid in person.</p> <p>C. Punishing Congress for not being more generous to a faithful ally.</p> <p>D. Caught completely by surprise. It was Adam Schiff who secretly held up the aid.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>5. The theory that Ukraine and not Russia was responsible for meddling in the 2016 election is:</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>A. Itself a bogus conspiracy theory concocted and spread by Russian intelligence, a fact made clear in Fiona Hill\u2019s disturbing testimony before the House intelligence committee.</p> <p>B. Hard to prove but also hard to disprove. Kind of like whether the Earth is round.</p> <p>C. Probably true, especially as we now know false things can be true.</p> <p>D. Flatly rejected by the CIA, FBI, NSA and the National Weather Service, and therefore indisputably true.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>6. Democrats are seeking to impeach President Trump because:</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>A. He has acted in a manner that any unbiased lawmaker, reviewing the case without knowledge of the party affiliation of the president, would consider a textbook example of impeachable conduct.</p> <p>B. They know they can\u2019t beat him fair and square in an election marked by the systematic suppression of minority vote and yet more Russian interference.</p> <p>C. They\u2019re witch-hunting haters.</p> <p>D. The Ukrainian intelligence service told them to.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>7. Consider the following scenario:</strong></p> <p>A mobster pays a visit to a small jewelry store in a dangerous part of town, and says to the young store owner, \u201cWord has it you were robbed last week. That\u2019s such a shame, a nice business like yours \u2013 robbed. So, I wanna offer you my help.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGee,\u201d says the young store owner, \u201cthat\u2019s awfully generous of you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m a generous guy. So I\u2019m gonna make sure nothing happens to you or your lovely store because there are some very bad people out there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you so much, how can I ever repay you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFunny you should ask \u2026 It just so happens that you have a regular customer named Sleepy Joe.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure, I know Mr Joe.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, I want you to put up a little sign in your shop window that says \u2018Sleepy Joe is a shoplifter\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut Mr Joe has never stolen from my store!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cListen, my friend, just put up the sign, you hear me? This is a tough neighborhood, a very tough neighborhood.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Can the conduct described here be analogized to the president\u2019s conversation with the Ukrainian president?</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>A. Yes, because both supply classic examples of a shakedown in the form of a quid pro quo.</p> <p>B. No, because even if Sleepy Joe hasn\u2019t shoplifted in the past, he very well may in the near future.</p> <p>C. No, because there are very few jewelry shops in Ukraine.</p> <p>D. Yes, because both supply heartwarming examples of a leader acting altruistically to provide security while calling attention to criminal acts.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>8. If the </strong><strong>supreme </strong><strong>court orders the president to release his tax returns, he should:</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>A. Obviously comply as that is what our system of constitutional governance requires.</p> <p>B. Comply, but only if Hunter Biden provides the White House with all his Snapchat photos from the last 10 years.</p> <p>C. Comply, but only if President Zelenskiy releases his tax returns.</p> <p>D. Create a supremer court to which he could appeal the supreme court\u2019s ruling.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>9. As a GOP lawmaker, I would be prepared to support President Trump\u2019s impeachment, should evidence prove that:</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>A. The president clearly and indisputably withheld desperately needed military aid from an ally simply to extract dirt on a political rival to tilt an upcoming election.</p> <p>B. President Putin has turned Mr Trump into a cyborg-zombie-ventriloquist\u2019s dummy working for Russian intelligence.</p> <p>C.

          "bodyText": "Now that the House judiciary committee has approved the articles of impeachment against Donald Trump, Republicans have prepared a quiz meant to test Republican lawmakers\u2019 support for the president. Following are excerpts from the Republican quiz. 1. The term \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d in the US constitution\u2019s impeachment clause refers to: A. Acts grossly incompatible with the proper function of the office of the presidency such as using the power of the office for personal gain, whether or not such acts are in violation of a specific criminal statute. B. Conduct that satisfies Answer A, but that clearly also violates a criminal statute. C. Bill Clinton D. Bill and/or Hillary Clinton 2. In creating the impeachment process, the founders meant to show: A. No one is above the law, including the president. B. No one is above the law, but the president should get to decide that for himself. C. No one is above the law, but the president is the law, so where\u2019s the problem? D. This is a sad example of a hyper-partisan question drafted by witch-hunting haters. 3. President Trump\u2019s 25 July phone conversation with President Zelenskiy was A. Manifestly unethical. B. Perfect. C. Not perfect, but pretty darn good. D. Quite problematic, but it didn\u2019t happen. E. Still better than his conversations with Angela Merkel, Emmanuel Macron, Boris Johnson and Justin Trudeau. 4. In withholding $400m in military aid to Ukraine appropriated by Congress, President Trump was: A. Transparently trying to force the newly elected president of a fledgling democracy to participate in a corrupt act. B. Waiting for President Zelenskiy to visit him at the White House so he could hand him the aid in person. C. Punishing Congress for not being more generous to a faithful ally. D. Caught completely by surprise. It was Adam Schiff who secretly held up the aid. 5. The theory that Ukraine and not Russia was responsible for meddling in the 2016 election is: A. Itself a bogus conspiracy theory concocted and spread by Russian intelligence, a fact made clear in Fiona Hill\u2019s disturbing testimony before the House intelligence committee. B. Hard to prove but also hard to disprove. Kind of like whether the Earth is round. C. Probably true, especially as we now know false things can be true. D. Flatly rejected by the CIA, FBI, NSA and the National Weather Service, and therefore indisputably true. 6. Democrats are seeking to impeach President Trump because: A. He has acted in a manner that any unbiased lawmaker, reviewing the case without knowledge of the party affiliation of the president, would consider a textbook example of impeachable conduct. B. They know they can\u2019t beat him fair and square in an election marked by the systematic suppression of minority vote and yet more Russian interference. C. They\u2019re witch-hunting haters. D. The Ukrainian intelligence service told them to. 7. Consider the following scenario: A mobster pays a visit to a small jewelry store in a dangerous part of town, and says to the young store owner, \u201cWord has it you were robbed last week. That\u2019s such a shame, a nice business like yours \u2013 robbed. So, I wanna offer you my help.\u201d \u201cGee,\u201d says the young store owner, \u201cthat\u2019s awfully generous of you.\u201d \u201cYeah, I\u2019m a generous guy. So I\u2019m gonna make sure nothing happens to you or your lovely store because there are some very bad people out there.\u201d \u201cThank you so much, how can I ever repay you?\u201d \u201cFunny you should ask \u2026 It just so happens that you have a regular customer named Sleepy Joe.\u201d \u201cSure, I know Mr Joe.\u201d \u201cWell, I want you to put up a little sign in your shop window that says \u2018Sleepy Joe is a shoplifter\u2019.\u201d \u201cBut Mr Joe has never stolen from my store!\u201d \u201cListen, my friend, just put up the sign, you hear me? This is a tough neighborhood, a very tough neighborhood.\u201d Can the conduct described here be analogized to the president\u2019s conversation with the Ukrainian president? A. Yes, because both supply classic examples of a shakedown in the form of a quid pro quo. B. No, because even if Sleepy Joe hasn\u2019t shoplifted in the past, he very well may in the near future. C. No, because there are very few jewelry shops in Ukraine. D. Yes, because both supply heartwarming examples of a leader acting altruistically to provide security while calling attention to criminal acts. 8. If the supreme court orders the president to release his tax returns, he should: A. Obviously comply as that is what our system of constitutional governance requires. B. Comply, but only if Hunter Biden provides the White House with all his Snapchat photos from the last 10 years. C. Comply, but only if President Zelenskiy releases his tax returns. D. Create a supremer court to which he could appeal the supreme court\u2019s ruling. 9. As a GOP lawmaker, I would be prepared to support President Trump\u2019s impeachment, should evidence prove that: A. The president clearly and indisputably withheld desperately needed military aid from an ally simply to extract dirt on a political rival to tilt an upcoming election. B. President Putin has turned Mr Trump into a cyborg-zombie-ventriloquist\u2019s dummy working for Russian intelligence. C. President Trump shot a person in cold blood on Fifth Avenue. D. 1, 2, and 3 and Trump\u2019s popularity among Republican voters slipped below 50%. E. No point even asking. Answer: 1. (C or D); 2. (B, C, or D); 3. (C, D, or E); 4. (D.); 5. (D); 6 (B or C); 7 (D); 8 (B or D); 9 (E).",

We don\u2019t normally see these eruptions coming, no matter how much we would like to. Many systems are already \u201cprimed\u201d for such events, but the triggers are poorly understood.</p> \n   <p>The warning periods, once an event gets under way, are likely in the order of seconds to minutes. Our only hope for anticipating these events is to track potential vapour and liquid pressure in hydrothermal systems and to learn from their long-term behaviour when they are at a super-critical state. Unfortunately there are no simple rules that can be followed and each hydrothermal system is different.</p> \n   <p>In this age of technology and instrumental monitoring, it seems irrational that there should be little or no warning for such eruptions. The eruption is not caused by magma, but by steam, and this is much harder to track in our current monitoring systems.</p> \n   <p>We have seen several other fatal hydrothermal catastrophes unfold in other parts of the world, such as the <a href=\"https://eos.org/research-spotlights/what-caused-the-fatal-2014-eruption-of-japans-mount-ontake\">2014 eruption of Mount Ontake in Japan</a>.

She said: \u201cIt\u2019s now clear that there were two groups on the island - those who were able to be evacuated and those who were close to the eruption.\u201d <br><br></li> \n   <li>White Island is about 50 km (30 miles) from the east coast of North Island and huge plumes were visible from the mainland. Volcanologists said the ash plume shot 12,000 feet (3,658 m) into the air. <br><br></li> \n   <li>There were still concerns on Tuesday morning about how close rescuers can get to the island due to ashfall, with officials saying they had reports of boats returning filled with up to half a metre of ash.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time

In this case, magma is shallow, and the heat and gases affect surface and groundwater to form vigorous hydrothermal systems.</p> \n   <p>In these, water is trapped in pores of rocks in a super-heated state. Any external process, such as an earthquake, gas input from below, or even a change in the lake water level can tip this delicate balance and release the pressure on the hot and trapped water.</p> \n   <p>The resulting steam-driven eruption, also called a <a href=\"https://www.gns.cri.nz/Home/Learning/Science-Topics/Volcanoes/Types-of-Volcanoes-Eruptions\">hydrothermal or phreatic eruption</a>, can happen suddenly and with little to no warning. The expansion of water into steam is supersonic in speed and the liquid can expand to 1,700 times its original volume. This produces catastrophic impacts.</p> \n   <p>The expansion energy is enough to shatter solid rock, excavate craters and eject rock fragments and ash out to hundreds of metres away from the vent. We know of sites in New Zealand where material has been blasted out over 3km from the vent by such eruptions.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Cronin also wrote about why such eruptions are so difficult to predict:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Monitoring and warning for hydrothermal eruptions is a huge challenge. We don\u2019t normally see these eruptions coming, no matter how much we would like to. Many systems are already \u201cprimed\u201d for such events, but the triggers are poorly understood.</p> \n   <p>The warning periods, once an event gets under way, are likely in the order of seconds to minutes. Our only hope for anticipating these events is to track potential vapour and liquid pressure in hydrothermal systems and to learn from their long-term behaviour when they are at a super-critical state. Unfortunately there are no simple rules that can be followed and each hydrothermal system is different.</p> \n   <p>In this age of technology and instrumental monitoring, it seems irrational that there should be little or no warning for such eruptions. The eruption is not caused by magma but by steam, and this is much harder to track.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-09T21:35:07.611Z\">at 9.35pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5deeba008f0820fa95dad56d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/paul-karp\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-09T21:23:07.866Z\">9.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Jacinda Ardern </strong>has given a further update that 31 people are in hospitals around New Zealand.</p> \n  <p>She said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I do need to commend our emergency services \u2013 they worked very, very quickly to make sure the persons got the critical care when and where they needed.

Five people are confirmed to have died in the eruption, eight are missing and presumed dead. You can see our full report here. Three of the dead were confirmed to be Australian by the country\u2019s prime minister, Scott Morrison. The family of New Zealand man Hayden Marshall-Inman, a guide for White Island tours, confirmed his death to local media, but police have not confirmed it. 31 people are being treated for burns, 27 of whom have burns to 30% of their bodies. Patients are aged 13-72. Officials say not all the burns victims are expected to survive. Police said they are conducting an investigation into the deaths on behalf of the coroner, correcting an earlier police statement that they were launching a criminal investigation. The 47 people on the island at the time of the eruption include 24 people from Australia, nine from US, two Britons, four from Germany, five from New Zealand, two from China and one from Malaysia. You can read our full report on those listed as missing here. Police efforts to monitor conditions on the island using a drone have been hampered by the wind. There was a 50% chance of another eruption of the same size or smaller in the next 24 hours. The New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, told parliament: \u201cThe scale of this tragedy is devastating. Our hearts go out to the families of those who are injured, missing or deceased.\u201d Laura Clarke, the UK\u2019s high commissioner to New Zealand, said two British women had been taken to hospital and that her team were providing assistance. The Ovation of the Seas cruise ship, where the majority of victims were passengers, will stay in Tauranga on Tuesday night. You can read how experts warned the eruption on the island was an accident waiting to happen. You can read what caused the volcanic eruption on New Zealand\u2019s White Island and why was there no warning, here. The Whakaari/White Island owners have expressed their condolences to those affected by Monday\u2019s eruption. The Trust, which owns the island, is managed by Whakaari Management Limited which comprises three directors who are also brothers: James Buttle, Andrew Buttle and Peter Buttle. Peter Buttle issued a statement saying his family had owned the island for over 80 years and are devastated by the tragic event. We are all shocked by what has occurred on Whakaari yesterday and our thoughts are with everyone affected by this tragedy. We wish to thank everyone involved in the rescue effort, including the first responders, medical personnel and the locals who helped evacuate people from the island. Their efforts have been both courageous and extraordinary. That we now have had a tragic event with devastating consequences leaves us absolutely heartbroken. Our thoughts are with the families of those affected, as well as the wider Whakat\u0101ne community. The Chinese embassy in New Zealand has posted an updated on its website on the two Chinese citizens affected by the eruption on White Island. It said that according to New Zealand police, two Chinese citizens had been near the site of the eruption. The consulate said that by late afternoon it had been notified by New Zealand\u2019s ministry of foreign affairs and trade police that one of the citizens had been injured and sent to hospital. The embassy said it has sent consular officials to the hospital. It has also requested New Zealand officials to provide information about the second citizen\u2019s situation as soon as possible. New Zealand police have issued a statement clarifying the investigation into the deaths on White Island. Earlier, deputy commissioner John Tims, said police would conduct a criminal investigation. However, a correction has been issued: At this time Police is (sic) investigating the death of the individuals on Whakaari / White Island on behalf of the Coroner. To correct an earlier statement, it is too early to confirm whether there will also be a criminal investigation. The Police investigation on behalf of the Coroner will be carried out in parallel with a WorkSafe New Zealand investigation. WorkSafe New Zealand has opened a health and safety investigation into the harm and loss of life caused by the eruption. As the workplace health and safety regulator and administrator of the Adventure Activities Regulations, WorkSafe will be investigating and considering all of the relevant work health and safety issues surrounding this tragic event. Passengers on the Ovation of the Seas cruise ship will spend another night in the Port of Tauranga. It\u2019s now expected to leave at 7.15am on Wednesday, according to the New Zealand Herald. New Zealand\u2019s GeoNet has just launched another update on the volcano. It says seismic activity remained weak and there had been no further eruptive activity. However GeoNet said they weree continuing to see \u201cgas-driven jetting from the active vent area\u201d. It said its monitoring equipment continued to work well, despite some sites being covered in ash. Over the next 24 hours we still estimate an equal likelihood of either no eruption or a smaller/similar sized eruption that would impact the main crater floor, based on our observations and measurements. There is a high level of uncertainty associated with this estimate and we are working to reduce that uncertainty. We also estimate the least likely scenario is a larger eruption. There is an extremely low likelihood of any ash impact to the mainland, but people may smell gas, depending on the prevailing wind direction. If you are just joining us on our coverage of the volcanic eruption in New Zealand, you can get yourself up to date quickly with our guide to what we know so far. The mayor of Whakat\u0101ne, Judy Turner, has held a press conference in the small coastal town this afternoon during which she said she \u201cwelcomed\u201d the criminal investigation into the disaster and hoped no stone would be left unturned, as everyone wanted reassurance that nothing \u201cuntoward\u201d had taken place \u201cIt\u2019s a natural question that comes out of the event, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything particular that is of concern,\u201d she said. \u201cWe do feel your pain, and we\u2019re here to support you,\u201d Turner added of the families gathering in town to mourn their loved ones, or wait for their bodies to be returned. The mayor said she continued to support tours of White Island in the future, but first questions needed to be answered as to who, if anyone, was responsible for the disaster, seh said, and if tourists should have been on the island when a level-2 threat was present. \u201cAt the time they went out it was a level 2, and in the matrix of things that is not considered a high reading ... they have been out numerous times at that level.\u201d Turner acknowledged that White Island tours had offered tourists \u201can amazing adventure tourism opportunity\u201d and had been running for 30 years without any problems. \u201cYou\u2019ll be aware that tourism is significant for our local area. We are aware there are questions and you can be assured ... that at the appropriate time we will answer the questions that need to be asked.\u201d Turner said police were working around the clock to get the remaining bodies off the Island, and boats had been stationed 1km off the coast of the island, from which drones had been launched on reconnaissance missions to monitor when it would be safe for police to land. When bodies were able to be retrieved, they would first be flown to Whakatane airport which was being prepared today, and then to the offices of the coroner in Auckland, she said. Turner added that while the local Iwi, Ngati Awa, had been showing \u201caroha\u201d to those affected, she had not yet spoken to the tribe\u2019s elders. I\u2019m just catching up with a few other points from that news conference. John Tims from NZ police said that authorities had been working today to determine the conditions on the island. \u201cThis will be done by a drone able to carry specialised measuring equipment. This requires a boat getting into, within 1km of the island, in order to launch the drones. We are hoping to do this today. Unfortunately, we have had one attempt, the conditions have been against us and it\u2019s been too windy. We will continue to do so today if weather permits,\u201d Tims said. With regards to the foreign nationals affected by the volcanic eruption in New Zealand, a team of three officials from the NZ department of foreign affairs and trade has been deployed to Whakatane to support diplomatic missions of affected foreign nationals. In terms of the condition on the island currently, civil defence spokesperson, Sarah Stuart-Black, said: \u201cMonitoring equipment on the island is still functional and providing near real-time data. GNS science will continue to closely monitor the situation on White Island. The web cameras indicate gas and steam jetting from the active vent area.\u201d Health authorities in New Zealand have contacted burns units in Australia to ask what capacity they have to take on patients, Guardian Australia understands. Protocol for treating disaster victims is for them to be treated at the hospital closest to their home, in anticipation of a long recovery period. That press conference has just wrapped up. Here\u2019s a summary of the most important points: New Zealand police have launched a criminal investigation into the disaster on White Island. Five people are confirmed dead and their bodies have been transferred to Auckland for a post mortem to be carried out. 31 patients are being treated for burns, including 27 who have burns to at least 30% of their bodies. Patients have been transferred to burns units across New Zealand and some may be transferred to Australia. There has been a decline in seismic activity on the island but scientists estimate there\u2019s a 50% chance of a smaller or similar sized eruption over the next 24hours, which means a 50% chance of no eruption. It\u2019s estimated that a large eruption is unlikely at this time. John Tims of NZ police was asked about whether the investigation would focus on the tour operators to the island: \u201cSo we\u2019ll look into if there was anyone criminally responsible for the deaths and injuries. It\u2019s early days yet. So we\u2019re just going to have to work through the evidence, talk to people, and conduct the investigation,\u201d Tims said. \u201cNot all of the (burns) patients will survive,\u201d Watson said. \u201cThere\u2019s many who have suffered inhalation injuries, damage to lungs, so they\u2019re requiring airway support. At this stage, that\u2019s the majority of the people who are in the hospitals,\u201d Watson said. Of the 31 people injured, 25 are now in our four regional burns units located in Christchurch, Hutt valley, Waikato and Middlemore hospital, Watson said. \u201cThey will be transferred to one of our regional burns units as soon as there\u2019s capacity. All our burns units are full to capacity. Our plastic surgeons, hospitals, anaesthetists are doing their best to treat the many who have sustained injuries.\u201d Dr Pete Watson also told the press conference that 27 of the 31 people being treated have suffered greater than 30% body-surface burns. John Tims says the police will open a criminal investigation into the circumstances of the deaths on White island. The nationalities of those on the island at the time of the explosion have been confirmed as 2 from UK, 4 from Germany, 24 from Australia, 5 from NZ, 2 from China, 9 from the US, one from Malaysia. Dr Pete Watson from the ministry of health is now updating the conference. He said patients have been transferred to burns units across New Zealand. Many have sustained substantial burns, including inhalation burns. Patients are aged between 13-72. He says they may transfer seriously injured patients to burns units in Australia. We are now hearing from John Tims, deputy commissioner of national operations for police in New Zealand. He has confirmed 5 fatalities. The bodies have been transported to Auckland where a post-mortem will be done. New Zealand police\u2019s press conference has begin. The first speaker is Sarah Stuart-Black, a Civil Defence spokesperson \u201cWe were struck by the amazing efforts from first responders,\u201d she tells the press conference\u201d. \u201cI would like to express our deepest sympathies for the families affected\u201d She said the ministry of foreign affairs and trade is providing consular assistance to foreign nationals affected by the eruption. She said monitoring equipment was still functioning on he island and was providing real-time data. There has been a decline in seismic activity. She said there is a 50% chance chance of another similar eruption in the next 24 hours. If there is another eruption, it is unlikely to reach the mainland. Following Monday\u2019s eruption, GeoNet has put together some detailed information about White Island. This includes: It was in almost continuous eruption from 1976-2000 and numerous explosive eruptions impacted the entire Main Crater floor area. A second eruptive episode started in 2011 and continues today. In 1914 a landslide destroyed a mining village and killed 10 workers on the Main Crater floor. There was no eruption related to this landslide. You can read their entire post here. Earlier police said work was being done to enable the recovery of the eight people who remained unaccounted for following yesterday\u2019s eruption. \u201cRecovering the remaining victims and returning them to their loved ones is an absolute priority for NZ Police,\u201d police said in a statement on Facebook. The first press conference we are expecting is from New Zealand police who will be giving an update on the emergency response to the volcanic eruption at Whakaari/White Island. It\u2019s expected to get underway in the next few minutes. We are expecting several press conferences in the next hour, including from police in Wellington, the mayor of Whakatane, and from GNS Science, New Zealand\u2019s leading provider of Earth, geoscience and isotope research and consultancy services. One of the families listed as missing is the Langfords from North Sydney. The parents, Anthony and Kristine Langford, were on holiday with their two children Jesse, 19, and Winona, 17. Jesse graduated from Marist North Shore in 2018. The school\u2019s principal, Tony Duncan, emailed parents letting them know that the former student was listed as missing. \u201cIt is with a heavy heart that I can confirm to you that several members of our Marist North shore family are missing in the aftermath of the White Island volcano disaster.\u201d \u201cJesse, who graduated last year was a talented and popular student during his time at the school, finishing up as Mackillop House captain,\u201d he said. He asked for school families to have the Langfords in their prayers. The New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has made a statement to parliament about the volcano\u2019s eruption. She confirmed that of the 47 people on or near White Island at the time of the eruption, five were dead, eight were missing and 31 sustained injuries \u201cmany of them critical\u201d. \u201cThe scale of this tragedy is devastating\u201d, she told parliament. \u201cOur hearts go out to the families of those who are injured, missing or deceased. Ardern paid tribute to the pilots and crew of three helicopters who flew to the island after the eruption to help the rescue operation. She said among those missing citizens from Australia, the US, the UK, China, Germany, Malaysia and New Zealand. \u201cTo those who have lost or are missing family and friends, we share in your grief and sorrow and we are devastated,\u201d Ardern said. \u201cTo our international partners and friends, we will do everything we can to support you as you have supported us in times past. \u201cIn particular, our family in Australia has been heavily impacted... We feel the pull of our bond acutely at this time.\u201d Ardern acknowledged the \u201cextraordinary efforts\u201d of the medical professionals across the country who are looking after the injured. \u201cAs we focus on the tragic events of Whakaari/White Island, I\u2019m reminded of two things: there is no limit to New Zealand\u2019s capacity to mobilise, to respond, to care and embrace those impacted by tragedy,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are a nation full of ordinary people who do extraordinary things.\u201d Hello this is Alison Rourke taking over this live blog from my colleague, Kate Lyons. If you are just joining us, here\u2019s the latest on who has been affected by the eruption on White Island. We know that five people have died. Three of them are thought to be Australians, according the Australian PM, Scott Morrison. The Guardian also understands that two guides from the island were also killed. A further eight people are confirmed as missing. We understand 47 people were on the island at the time of the eruption, 38 of them from the cruise liner Ovation of the Seas. New Zealand\u2019s Red Cross has published a list of people who have been listed as missing and those who have been accounted for. You can reach that list here. A report from AAP: The air is heavy and flags are at half mast in Whakatane. Unlike Monday, when police and emergency services flew into furious action after Whakaari\u2019s eruption, the town is now calm and waiting. They are waiting for White Island to be cleared for access, and they are waiting for updates about those in hospital. Those waiting for news are doing so at the local marae, or Maori meeting house. \u201cThe marae provides a focal point for the community to rally together, to provide help and care for those who are hurting at the moment,\u201d community leader William Stewart told AAP. \u201cAt 10 o\u2019clock this morning we opened the marae and undertook a karakia, a spiritual ceremony. \u201cWe invited those who had been impacted, staff, emergency response teams, friends and family of those that were caught up in yesterday\u2019s events.\u201d People from all backgrounds are bringing food and offering support. Stewart said more than a hundred people attended, including Australians. \u201cPeople of different backgrounds. The tribe was here and there were a lot of locals and people from out of town drawn by yesterday\u2019s events,\u201d he said. \u201cAbsolutely people are grieving and it\u2019s completely understandable. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to talk to them to realise they\u2019re hurting and they\u2019re deep in grief. \u201cIt\u2019s a privilege for us as a tribe to be able to welcome people here and be able to care for them.\u201d Marae leaders maintain close communications with police and other authorities; Australian consular support made themselves known on Monday. Stewart was eager to point out a historical connection between the marae and Australia and the United Kingdom - two of the countries that had nationals on or near Whakaari during the eruption. The marae is known as Mataatua or \u2018the house that came home\u2019. The meeting house was built in the 1870s, but seized by colonial powers to Australia and then Britain for exhibitions and kept overseas for more than a century. It returned in 1996, and following restoration work takes pride of place in Whakatane. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s such a fitting place for today. It\u2019s a symbol of our resilience, our unity and our strength,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cIt\u2019s pertinent, because we do have some Australian whanau, Australian family that were impacted yesterday. There\u2019s no better place for them than \u2018the house that came home\u2019 and is now back on our land.\u201d AAP reports that a website set up by the New Zealand Red Cross to help connect people affected by the catastrophic volcanic eruption off the North Island has been inundated by families of the missing. People were seeking information about loved ones from the United Kingdom, United States, China, Singapore, Bourdeaux in France, Guatemala, Hong Kong, Canada, Portugal, Burma, New Delhi, New Guinea, and Holland. So far, five people have been confirmed dead. It is believed up to three of those people are Australians, although this has not been confirmed. Another eight, all believed to be Australians, are missing or unaccounted for. Some 34 people, including 13 Australians, were rescued and taken to hospital mostly suffering burns. Of these, 31 remain in hospital while three have been discharged. Here is the Red Cross list of the Australians listed as missing at 09.30 AEDT. Some may still be in hospital, some may be unaccounted for and some may be safe but not yet able to contact the Red Cross or others to notify their status. Australians listed as missing as of 9:30am AEDT South Australia Gavin Brian Dallow, 35, Adelaide Zoe Hosking, 15, Adelaide Lisa, no other details, Adelaide Queensland Robert Rogers, 78, Herberton, Queensland Maree Fish, 46, Brisbane Amy Miall, 30, Brisbane New South Wales Maureen Jones, 68, Bathurst NSW Jason David Griffiths, 33, Coffs Harbour, NSW Karla Michelle Mathews, 32, Coffs Habour, NSW Richard Aaron Elzer, 32, Coffs Harbour Alison Harris, 52, Newcastle, NSW Anthony Langford, 51, North Sydney Jesse Landford, 18, North Sydney Winona Langford, 17, North Sydney Kristine Langford, age not given, Australia (believed North Sydney) Gary Woolley, age not given, Sydney Jane Murray, 56, Sydney Marion London, 56, Sydney Sheree Toope, 31, Sydney Mathew Thomas, 31, Tamworth NSW Victoria Stuart Raymond Trott, 45, Melbourne Australia (no state named) Jessica Richards, 20, Australia Julie Richards, 47, Australia Martin Hollander, 48, Australia Susan Maree Cole, no other details, Australia NZ Red Cross website: redcross.org.nz Recovering the remaining victims an \u2018absolute priority\u2019 for NZ police New Zealand police have issued a new statement, saying they were continuing work to recover the eight people who are unaccounted for, it reads: Work is continuing today to enable the recovery of the eight people who remain unaccounted for on Whakaari / White Island following yesterday\u2019s eruption. Recovering the remaining victims and returning them to their loved ones is an absolute priority for NZ Police. Police are working closely with experts from GNS Science to get an understanding of the current environment on Whakaari / White Island and the likelihood of any further volcanic activity, as well as any risks posed to recovery teams by gases in the atmosphere. This is a heartbreaking situation for all involved and we are working to provide every support possible to the families and loved ones of those killed and injured in the eruption. Police Family Liaison Officers are being deployed around New Zealand to assist with that support. Police understand the high level of interest from media \u2013 both domestic and international \u2013 regarding the nationalities of those killed and injured in the eruption. That information, as well as condition updates for those injured in the eruption, will be released at the earliest opportunity. Whakat\u0101ne District Mayor Judy Turner says her heart goes out to the injured, the missing and the deceased, and their families and wh\u0101nau. A Civil Defence Centre opened today at Te K\u014dputu a te whanga a Toi (Whakat\u0101ne Library) at 49 K\u0101kahoroa Drive, Whakat\u0101ne to provide psycho-social support to those that need this. Please note that the Whakat\u0101ne iSITE is closed for at least the next 24 hours - our immediate priority is support for those visitors and operators affected by yesterday\u2019s tragic events. Morgan Godfrey writes for the Guardian: At 2.11pm yesterday, as the Whakaari eruption was happening, I was out mowing my lawns. From my home at Te Kaha, a tiny settlement on the North Island\u2019s east coast, you can make out the volcano\u2019s sunken crater. The 300-metre dust cliffs frame the northern and southern edges, and in the centre is an east-facing pit where ancient birders and old sulphur miners once did their work. On Monday the only workers and visitors on island were tour operators and tourists, several whom never made it back from yesterday\u2019s destruction. At 2.15pm I went to empty the catcher, and I stood at the garden edge watching the ash cloud climb. I didn\u2019t think too much of it. When I was growing up volcanic activity on Whakaari was more or less continuous. Every year or so the crater would spew out mud and rock. Steam was a daily occurrence, painting the horizon white. According to GeoNet the island was in a continuous eruption from 1975 to 2000. Disaster, or at least the ever-rising threat of it, was background music in our lives. Whakaari? There she goes again. But yesterday was different. At 2.20pm I went to the cliff\u2019s edge for closer inspection. The ash cloud was still climbing. Six-thousand feet. Nine-thousand feet. Twelve-thousand feet. I finally knew something was wrong. Zoe Hosking, a year 9 student from Adelaide, is among those missing, her school has confirmed, along with her entire family. The atmosphere is sombre at the wharf in Whakatane, with three White Island boats docked in port. A rubber dingy in the back of one of the boats remains covered in ash, and was used yesterday to rescue 23 people off the island following the eruption. Local tourism charters have cancelled today\u2019s excursions, saying it wouldn\u2019t be \u201cappropriate\u201d after yesterday\u2019s tragedy. Signs posted by the harbourmaster at the wharf warn people to stay five nautical miles away from White Island, unless tasked with official police or search and rescue business. A magnitude 5.3 quake has occurred south of Gisborne. Why was there no warning about the eruption? Shane Cronin, a professor at the University of Auckland, has written analysis about what caused the eruption and why we didn\u2019t know it was coming. Monitoring and warning for hydrothermal eruptions is a huge challenge. We don\u2019t normally see these eruptions coming, no matter how much we would like to. Many systems are already \u201cprimed\u201d for such events, but the triggers are poorly understood. The warning periods, once an event gets under way, are likely in the order of seconds to minutes. Our only hope for anticipating these events is to track potential vapour and liquid pressure in hydrothermal systems and to learn from their long-term behaviour when they are at a super-critical state. Unfortunately there are no simple rules that can be followed and each hydrothermal system is different. In this age of technology and instrumental monitoring, it seems irrational that there should be little or no warning for such eruptions. The eruption is not caused by magma, but by steam, and this is much harder to track in our current monitoring systems. We have seen several other fatal hydrothermal catastrophes unfold in other parts of the world, such as the 2014 eruption of Mount Ontake in Japan. New Zealand has been luckier than many other parts of the world, until now. Jacinda Ardern met with first responders this morning. Laura Clark, the high commissioner to New Zealand has confirmed that two British women were among the injured. They have not been named. This is Kate Lyons taking over the blog from Charlotte Graham-McLay. If you have questions, news tips or something to share you can get in touch with me on Twitter or on email: kate.lyons@theguardian.com Here\u2019s what we know so far: Five people are confirmed dead and eight people are missing, presumed dead, New Zealand officials confirmed on Tuesday morning. Thirty-one people are currently in hospital and three have been discharged. Many of the injured were in critical condition, most from burns. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told reporters that aerial reconnaissance flights did not show any signs of life on the volcanic White Island and officials are not expecting to find any survivors on the island. New Zealanders and tourists from Australia, the United States, Britain, China and Malaysia were among the missing and injured, confirmed Ardern. Australian prime minister Scott Morrison confirmed that 11 Australians are unaccounted for, he said three Australians are believed to be among the dead. \u201cI fear there is worse news to come,\u201d he said. Ardern confirmed that there were two explosions on the volcanic White Island on Monday afternoon, and the eruptions spewed a plume of ash thousands of metres into the air. She said: \u201cIt\u2019s now clear that there were two groups on the island - those who were able to be evacuated and those who were close to the eruption.\u201d White Island is about 50 km (30 miles) from the east coast of North Island and huge plumes were visible from the mainland. Volcanologists said the ash plume shot 12,000 feet (3,658 m) into the air. There were still concerns on Tuesday morning about how close rescuers can get to the island due to ashfall, with officials saying they had reports of boats returning filled with up to half a metre of ash. Ray Cas, a professor emeritus at Monash University, has told Reuters that the island \u201chas been a disaster waiting to happen for many years\u201d. \u201cHaving visited it twice, I have always felt that it was too dangerous to allow the daily tour groups that visit the uninhabited island volcano by boat and helicopter,\u201d Cas said in comments published by the Australian Science Media Centre. More front pages from Australia: The eruption leads the papers in Australia today. Stephen D\u2019Antal in Tauranga has spoken to Australian journalist Donna Field, who was on board the Ovation of the Seas for a family holiday. She said passengers had been told to be back on board by 5.30pm on Tuesday but had no information on when they would sail. \u201cThe mood has changed dramatically,\u201d said Field, who works for the ABC. Field said she watched ship\u2019s captain Henrik Loy on Monday afternoon as he dealt with breaking news of the disaster to the passengers. \u201cHis voice was pretty shaky,\u201d she said. \u201cHe had two phones in his hands and was just pacing on the bridge. I can\u2019t imagine what he was going through. Everyone just stood stock still and listened. They\u2019re shaken up.\u201d Some images are emerging from Whakatane. A geologist has posted the first satellite images from the island taken after the eruption. A Twitter user has posted pictures from White Island, what he says was minutes before the eruption. The prime minister has outlined what she will be doing over the course of the day in her RNZ interview: I\u2019ll be reaching out to those who are among the first responders. There were, as I described, helicopter [pilots] with no thought to their own safety, operators who travelled to the island to extract survivors. They made an exceptional decision under hugely volatile circumstances, and I know New Zealand would want to acknowledge that. The prime minister was also asked \u201cYou must think, \u2018what fresh hell is this?\u2019\u201d She responded: For New Zealand, we take such pride in caring for those who make the effort to visit New Zealand, so I know the whole nation will be feeling this acutely, and of course our focus as a country will be on supporting those affected, including those from within New Zealand but also particularly those who are very close to us, Australia, but every foreign national who has been affected. More from the Ardern interview. The prime minister was asked \u201cDid you at any stage ask how come we can\u2019t go back and see if there is anybody else we can bring off?\u201d This is her response: I certainly asked questions about that, of course, because for anyone who has a family member missing is to ensure that everything that could be done, was done. As I said there were reconnaissance flyovers, but I\u2019m advised someone was also able to land and undertake some assessment as well. So that\u2019s the information on which the police had made an assessment, from all of that \u2026 that everyone who could be evacuated, was, and there was no remaining sign of life. Jacinda Ardern has given an interview to RNZ this morning. Asked if there would be an inquiry into the tragedy she said: Certainly there are questions that are being asked, and they will be answered, but today the focus is on the care of those who are \u2026 in critical condition, the recovery mission, which is a focus for the police. There will be questions that will need to be answered and will be, by the appropriate authorities, but today we\u2019re rightly focused on those who will be affected. There will be questions that have to be answered, regardless of the form it takes, information needs to be put into the public domain to answer the questions that are being asked. Just for context, tourism operations have been undertaken I understand for the better part of 30 years on White Island, it\u2019s been obviously an active volcano throughout that time. The advice I was given yesterday was that it\u2019s been at what\u2019s called Level 2, which was its status at the time of the eruption. It\u2019s been at Level 2 at various points in recent history. I\u2019m also advised that in 2016 if my memory\u2019s correct, when there was an eruption overnight, it was at Level 1, a lower level. It is an unpredictable, live volcano.\u201d Stephen D\u2019Antal is reporting for the Guardian from the Bay of Plenty: Thousands of passengers from the Ovation of the Seas flooded into picturesque Mount Maunganui today, knowing little about the fate of their 38 companions who had been on a day trip to Whakaari/White Island. A couple from Sydney said the ship\u2019s captain, Henrik Loy, had made an announcement through the tannoy about the volcanic eruption on Monday evening but given few details. \u201cHe said as much as he could given the situation,\u201d said Helen, on holiday with her husband William, who declined to give her surname. \u201cHe said there were a number of affected family members still on board whose loved ones were affected and their priority is to safeguard them and their privacy. \u201cThere is a subdued atmosphere. I have not seen anyone obviously affected, they may have been segregated, but I can tell you there were reports last night that there was partying on board and that was completely untrue.\u201d Boris Johnson, the British prime minister, has tweeted about the disaster: \u201cDevastating scenes in New Zealand. I\u2019ve been in contact with Prime Minister @jacindaardern to express our deepest sympathies. There are many people still feared missing, and my heart goes out to all those affected and their families.\u201d Alison Rourke, my colleague in Sydney, has spoken to a passenger who is on Ovation of the Seas. Lynette travelled from Sydney to New Zealand on the Ovation of the Seas. She chose to go on a day trip to Rotorua yesterday instead of to White Island. She said passengers were waiting to see if they were allowed to get off the ship today. She said the captain and crew were doing their best to comfort passengers but they were not getting a great deal of detailed information available about what happened or about the missing people. Lynette said the captain\u2019s announcements had \u201casked us to pray for the ones who have not come back\u201d. \u201cThey are doing their best to comfort the families and look after the ones that are in hospital,\u201d Lynette said. \u201cYou really do feel for the families of these people involved. There appears to be crew involved too.\u201d The ship was supposed to sail to Wellington today. The plume of smoke from the volcanic eruption was captured by the Japanese Space Agency weather satellite Himawari 8. Shane Cronin, a professor of earth sciences at the University of Auckland has written a piece for the Conversation about the causes of the explosion: White Island is one of several volcanoes in New Zealand that can produce sudden explosive eruptions at any time. In this case, magma is shallow, and the heat and gases affect surface and groundwater to form vigorous hydrothermal systems. In these, water is trapped in pores of rocks in a super-heated state. Any external process, such as an earthquake, gas input from below, or even a change in the lake water level can tip this delicate balance and release the pressure on the hot and trapped water. The resulting steam-driven eruption, also called a hydrothermal or phreatic eruption, can happen suddenly and with little to no warning. The expansion of water into steam is supersonic in speed and the liquid can expand to 1,700 times its original volume. This produces catastrophic impacts. The expansion energy is enough to shatter solid rock, excavate craters and eject rock fragments and ash out to hundreds of metres away from the vent. We know of sites in New Zealand where material has been blasted out over 3km from the vent by such eruptions. Cronin also wrote about why such eruptions are so difficult to predict: Monitoring and warning for hydrothermal eruptions is a huge challenge. We don\u2019t normally see these eruptions coming, no matter how much we would like to. Many systems are already \u201cprimed\u201d for such events, but the triggers are poorly understood. The warning periods, once an event gets under way, are likely in the order of seconds to minutes. Our only hope for anticipating these events is to track potential vapour and liquid pressure in hydrothermal systems and to learn from their long-term behaviour when they are at a super-critical state. Unfortunately there are no simple rules that can be followed and each hydrothermal system is different. In this age of technology and instrumental monitoring, it seems irrational that there should be little or no warning for such eruptions. The eruption is not caused by magma but by steam, and this is much harder to track. Jacinda Ardern has given a further update that 31 people are in hospitals around New Zealand. She said: I do need to commend our emergency services \u2013 they worked very, very quickly to make sure the persons got the critical care when and where they needed. Now in the aftermath, we are working through all the information we need in order to give the information we need to victims\u2019 families but also to those who want to provide consular assistance. New Zealand\u2019s prime minister said Australia had offered \u201cbroad\u201d support \u2013 \u201cany help that we need\u201d \u2013 including the offer of personnel for victim identification. Ardern said she had received messages from the prime minister of the UK, Boris Johnson, and Canada\u2019s Justin Trudeau in addition to phone contact with Scott Morrison. After the tragedy, there are questions about why tourists were allowed on the island at all considering the risks. A volcanologist, Carina Fearnley, has spoken to the UK\u2019s Channel 5 News saying she had visited the island and found it terrifying given her understanding of the danger. Scott Morrison said it was \u201cstill too early to tell\u201d the full extent of injuries of the 13 Australians in hospitals around New Zealand but that \u201ca number of them are in critical conditions\u201d including those with \u201cquite severe burns\u201d. Marise Payne said the Australians \u201care located in multiple hospitals around New Zealand, in Waikato, in Christchurch, in Middlemore in Auckland, in Tauranga and in Hart Valley\u201d. Payne said: The challenge for the next few days is supporting those Australians who are so badly injured in hospitals across New Zealand, supporting their families and supporting the families of those who remain unaccounted for. We will be working closely with New Zealand authorities and with Royal Caribbean to provide any support that we can, and we will ensure that all assistance is provided to them and to their families. Australia\u2019s prime minister, Scott Morrison, and the foreign minister, Marise Payne, have given an update on the 24 Australians believed to be on White Island during the eruption. Morrison said: Of the 24 ones, we have been able to ascertain overnight and this morning that 13 of those Australians are hospitalised across multiple hospitals in New Zealand. There are 11 Australians that are still unaccounted for, and that we fear of the five deceased persons, that three of those, up to three are Australians, but that is not yet confirmed. That death toll is expected to rise, Morrison said: But with 11 Australians unaccounted for, three of those are feared to be amongst the five that have already been identified as deceased. This is a very, very hard day for a lot of Australian families whose loved ones have been caught up in this terrible, terrible tragedy. Can I also confirm that, after speaking with the New Zealand prime minister, that the operation has moved into recovery phase. There were four helicopters that were there as part of the rescue operation and assessing the scene, as the prime minister confirmed earlier, that were able to take a reconnaissance of the island at that time, and as New Zealand police said last night, there is not considered to be anyone on that island that remains alive ... I fear there is worse news to come over the course of perhaps today or over the next few days. This is a terrible tragedy, a time of great innocence and joy interrupted by the horror of that eruption, and I would ask again that we refrain from any speculation about individuals at this time so we can ensure that we can contact and deal directly with families to ease what will be a highly anxious and highly upsetting time for them. Here\u2019s a quick recap of where we left things in our live coverage from events on Monday: Police have said that they believe there are no survivors left on the island after reconnaissance flights showed \u201cno signs of life had been seen at any point\u201d. The military will deploy drones on Tuesday to assess the situation on the ground. As many as 27 people were thought to have been stranded on the island after the eruption. Prime minister Jacinda Ardern is expected to travel to the island on Tuesday. New Zealand police deputy commissioner John Timms told a briefing that police and rescue crews have still not been able to access to the island, after advice from volcano experts. \u201cThe physical environment is unsafe for us to return to the island.\u201d. A number of people have been taken to hospital, some with burns as a result of the eruption. Fewer than 50 people were on the island at the time of the eruption, and 23 have been taken off. 30 to 38 of those people were passengers on the cruise ship Ovation of the Seas, as confirmed by the chief executive of the New Zealand Cruise Association. The eruption occurred about 2.11pm local time, 48km off the coast of the Bay of Plenty, in the North Island. Academics have questioned the suitability of White Island, New Zealand\u2019s most active cone volcano, as a tourist destination, saying it \u201cwas a disaster waiting to happen\u201d. New Zealand Red Cross has activated the Family Links website for those concerned that their loved ones may have been caught up in the incident. The Australian prime minister Scott Morrison is speaking to reporters in Sydney about the tragedy. Three Australians believed to have been killed and eight missing on White Island after the eruption. Here\u2019s some of what he had to say: Yesterday there were 24 Australians enjoying a wonderful cruise in New Zealand, taking in those sights together, enjoying life, a peaceful time. They were aged between 17 and 72. Morrison said Australian police would be working with New Zealand police on victim identification and forensics and would offer any other support required. Hello and welcome to our continued live coverage of the Whakaari/White Island volcano eruption. There are no signs of life on the active volcano Whakaari, or White Island, in New Zealand, where eight people are still missing after an eruption on Monday, according to the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern. Thirty-one people are in hospitals around New Zealand recovering from injuries \u2013 some of them badly burned \u2013 and five people are confirmed dead. Their bodies were returned to New Zealand\u2019s mainland yesterday. While there is no official list of the injured and missing, there are reports that they came from all over the world, including two from the UK, who are in hospital. A large group were passengers on the Ovation of the Seas cruise ship, which was docked nearby. Questions remain about recovery efforts on the island \u2013 the mission is no longer considered a rescue operation \u2013 and what will happen next. Ardern revealed on Tuesday morning that private helicopter pilots and one rescue helicopter had landed on the island in the immediate aftermath of the eruption and were able to rescue survivors. But by the time the authorities got involved, it was deemed too dangerous to land there, and rescuers have not been on the ground since. Emergency services, scientists and the military are working together to decide when the situation is safe for searchers to access Whakaari. Ardern would not answer questions on Tuesday about whether the tourist operation that transported 10,000 people a year to the island should have been visiting Whakaari. She said tours had been running to the island for years while the volcano was active.",

The sketch wraps up with a half-clever dig at Melania Trump\u2019s hypocritical anti-bullying initiative and a groan-worthy Peloton reference, the first of two for the night.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to see what the writers are going for. When the real-life leaders mocked Trump they had every reason for doing so, but here they\u2019re portrayed as bratty high school bullies and Trump is the sympathetic one. The show seems to want to twist the knife in Trump\u2019s wounded ego but it ends up bolstering his anti-Nato stance by presenting its members as smarmy elitist punks. It\u2019s not the worst cold open of the season, but it may be the most misguided.</p> <p>Jennifer Lopez hosts for a third time.

She concludes by shedding her tux to reveal the iconic green Versace dress she wore to the 2000 Grammys.</p> <p>Not to begrudge Lopez her success, but the whole thing comes off as a bit too self-congratulatory. She and the writers might have at least tried to add some jokes to the mix other than the single one about how even at 50 she\u2019s still hot enough make men\u2019s heads explode.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/nbcsnl/status/1203537951793307648\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Fast Times at the NATO cafeteria. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SNL?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#SNL</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/1Vga5Fy6yW\">pic.twitter.com/1Vga5Fy6yW</a></p>&mdash; Saturday Night Live - SNL (@nbcsnl) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nbcsnl/status/1203537951793307648?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 8, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>In the first sketch, a married couple (Lopez and Mikey Day) win a surprise home makeover, but their disparate levels of attractiveness \u2013 she\u2019s a \u201cbronze goddess\u201d, he\u2019s \u201can unemployed Smurf man\u201d with an average package \u2013 cause the host to have a stroke. Its five minutes of the same joke, over and over again. Much the same can be said of Chad &amp; J-Lo, in which Lopez meets and falls for Pete Davidson\u2019s slacker chick-magnet, much to chagrin of her fiance, Alex Rodriguez. If you\u2019ve seen one Chad sketch you have seen them all.</p> <p>The Corporal is a black-and-white drama about two sisters (Aidy Bryant and Kate McKinnon) competing for the affection of a rich suitor. Their attempts to sabotage each other are thwarted by the intrusion of a gorgeous third sister, who they have kept hidden all their lives. There\u2019s some enjoyably cartoonish slapstick and a solid final punchline but it\u2019s yet another piece revolving almost entirely around how attractive Lopez is. That wasn\u2019t a strong enough hook to carry one sketch, let alone three in a row plus the monologue.</p> <p>DaBaby is the night\u2019s musical guest.

          "bodyText": "We open in the Nato cafeteria, where the \u201ccool kids\u201d \u2013 Justin Trudeau (Jimmy Fallon), Emmanuel Macron (Paul Rudd) and dumpy hanger-on Boris Johnson (James Corden) \u2013 tease and ostracize Donald Trump (Alec Baldwin). The president is desperate for their approval but the only thing his efforts buy him is a note taped to his back that says \u201cImpeach Me\u201d. The sketch wraps up with a half-clever dig at Melania Trump\u2019s hypocritical anti-bullying initiative and a groan-worthy Peloton reference, the first of two for the night. It\u2019s hard to see what the writers are going for. When the real-life leaders mocked Trump they had every reason for doing so, but here they\u2019re portrayed as bratty high school bullies and Trump is the sympathetic one. The show seems to want to twist the knife in Trump\u2019s wounded ego but it ends up bolstering his anti-Nato stance by presenting its members as smarmy elitist punks. It\u2019s not the worst cold open of the season, but it may be the most misguided. Jennifer Lopez hosts for a third time. Dressed in a tuxedo, she celebrates her \u201cunbelievable year\u201d \u2013 which saw her star in the biggest movie of her career, sell out a concert tour, land next year\u2019s Super Bowl half-time show, get engaged to a former Yankee and turn 50 \u2013 by leading the Rockettes in a rendition of Santa Claus is Coming to Town. She concludes by shedding her tux to reveal the iconic green Versace dress she wore to the 2000 Grammys. Not to begrudge Lopez her success, but the whole thing comes off as a bit too self-congratulatory. She and the writers might have at least tried to add some jokes to the mix other than the single one about how even at 50 she\u2019s still hot enough make men\u2019s heads explode. In the first sketch, a married couple (Lopez and Mikey Day) win a surprise home makeover, but their disparate levels of attractiveness \u2013 she\u2019s a \u201cbronze goddess\u201d, he\u2019s \u201can unemployed Smurf man\u201d with an average package \u2013 cause the host to have a stroke. Its five minutes of the same joke, over and over again. Much the same can be said of Chad &amp; J-Lo, in which Lopez meets and falls for Pete Davidson\u2019s slacker chick-magnet, much to chagrin of her fiance, Alex Rodriguez. If you\u2019ve seen one Chad sketch you have seen them all. The Corporal is a black-and-white drama about two sisters (Aidy Bryant and Kate McKinnon) competing for the affection of a rich suitor. Their attempts to sabotage each other are thwarted by the intrusion of a gorgeous third sister, who they have kept hidden all their lives. There\u2019s some enjoyably cartoonish slapstick and a solid final punchline but it\u2019s yet another piece revolving almost entirely around how attractive Lopez is. That wasn\u2019t a strong enough hook to carry one sketch, let alone three in a row plus the monologue. DaBaby is the night\u2019s musical guest. Joined by masked dance crew the Jabbawockeez, he performs Bop. On Weekend Update, Colin Jost covers House speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s claim, upon being asked if she hates Trump, that her Catholic faith prevents her from hating anyone.

The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2019/dec/04/queen-gestures-at-princess-anne-for-not-greeting-donald-trump-video\" title=\"\">second</a> came when the Queen, while greeting Trump, gestured to her daughter, who then shrugged and pointed behind her. She was, as the internet will have it, a mood.</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t matter that Anne was not heard saying anything about Trump, or that she was not snubbing him, as quickly became clear. Just as people grasped for 12 yellow stars in five feathery flowers on a hat, so we grasped for regal disdain in the direction of the US president. Whether it existed or not was irrelevant, if we could believe that it might be the case for just long enough to share it.</p> <p>A devoted royalist friend of mine explained that Anne was \u201cthe insider\u2019s royal\u201d. \u201cIf you know, you know,\u201d he said, knowingly. Certainly, the evidence suggests that if the royal family were, for some reason, to need to put forward an alternative to those conducting themselves, say, in a manner unbecoming, for whom being too honourable is a terrible burden, then Anne is the one to do it. Low key, hard working, she refused titles for her children, which makes her seem eminently sensible.

          "bodyText": "The presence of Princess Anne at the Nato summit has proved to be a choose your own adventure in the style of the Queen\u2019s \u201cEU flag\u201d hat. Standing with the group of world leaders caught chortling along to Justin Trudeau as he smack-talked President Trump, Anne had her first viral moment of the week. The second came when the Queen, while greeting Trump, gestured to her daughter, who then shrugged and pointed behind her. She was, as the internet will have it, a mood. It doesn\u2019t matter that Anne was not heard saying anything about Trump, or that she was not snubbing him, as quickly became clear. Just as people grasped for 12 yellow stars in five feathery flowers on a hat, so we grasped for regal disdain in the direction of the US president. Whether it existed or not was irrelevant, if we could believe that it might be the case for just long enough to share it. A devoted royalist friend of mine explained that Anne was \u201cthe insider\u2019s royal\u201d. \u201cIf you know, you know,\u201d he said, knowingly. Certainly, the evidence suggests that if the royal family were, for some reason, to need to put forward an alternative to those conducting themselves, say, in a manner unbecoming, for whom being too honourable is a terrible burden, then Anne is the one to do it. Low key, hard working, she refused titles for her children, which makes her seem eminently sensible. On being ordered out of the car at gunpoint during a violent attempted kidnapping in 1974, she infamously replied: \u201cNot bloody likely.\u201d Her main interest is horses, which is better than 17-year-old girls. There is, too, a matter of timing. The Crown continues to inform the national conversation, for better or worse, evoking the humanity of the royals at a time when belief that such a thing exists is in shorter supply. It bleeds into what we believe to be true about the royal family, regardless of whether it is or not. The heir to the throne emerges as a sympathetic figure; a New Yorker interview with the actor who plays him, Josh O\u2019Connor, was headlined \u201cCan The Crown make us crush on Prince Charles?\u201d I shuddered. It works even more to Anne\u2019s favour that fictional Anne is the best character in it. Erin Doherty plays her with eyebrow-raising sass, as the kind of woman who tells her maudlin brother to \u201cchin up, nobody likes a misery guts\u201d as she listens to records in bare feet.

          "body": "<h2><strong>Monday</strong></h2> <p>I\u2019m not sure what the protocols are for these sorts of events, but the sight of Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn attending the vigil for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/04/london-bridge-attack-victims-died-after-being-stabbed-in-chest-inquest\">Jack Merritt and Saskia Jones</a>, who were killed in the London Bridge terrorist attack, felt like shameless political grandstanding: a desire to be seen to be doing the right thing, rather than heartfelt sympathy. And judging by what Jack\u2019s father later wrote about the prime minister he would probably have also preferred Johnson to be a no show. Shortly after the vigil, various members of one of my WhatsApp groups expressed much the same feeling and we made a promise to actively prevent politicians from pitching up at our funerals or hospital beds if we were killed or injured in a terrorist attack or some other major incident. Should the prime minister, or any other political leader, try to muscle in on my family\u2019s grief, I want a security detail to escort them off the premises. If they insist on making statements \u201cto express the nation\u2019s feelings\u201d they can do so via a video-link from their own bedrooms. And there will be no need for them to worry about looking as if they didn\u2019t give a toss by not attending, because my friends will have put out a statement to the media saying they were NFI. Not that I have given much thought to what sort of funeral I do want, though I\u2019ve always thought how weird it must have been for the Queen Mother to look out of her bedroom window and watch the military rehearsing for hers. But my friend Simone has her funeral arrangements totally sorted. While her close friend Ali was dying of cancer, she dreamed of her own funeral \u2013 the music, the readings \u2013 in its entirety. When she woke up she remembered everything, thought it to be just perfect, and wrote out her instructions. I\u2019m still waiting for that dream.</p> <h2><strong>Tuesday</strong></h2> <p>A study of 2,000 Americans has found that most people think <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2019/dec/03/why-do-people-think-41-is-too-old-to-exercise-its-a-perfect-time-to-start\">41 is the age at which it is far too late to start exercising</a>. For once I find myself on the right side of medical advice, if not necessarily for all the right reasons. I took almost no exercise at all in my 20s \u2013 heroin addiction and elite sport proved somewhat incompatible \u2013 but once I got clean I started running and going to the gym obsessively. Sometimes more than once a day. When I couldn\u2019t sleep, I\u2019d even go out running in the middle of the night to feel the freedom of the streets and escape my thoughts. Once the children arrived, I rather let myself go for about six years \u2013 coping with two toddlers and work was a 24-hour job \u2013 but after I\u2019d spent a month at a mental hospital being treated for depression, I restarted a four- or five-day-a-week exercise regime, to give me time off from myself, as much as anything. One of the best parts of exercising is the mental numbness induced by pushing yourself hard and the feeling of relief when you eventually stop. And I\u2019ve kept at it ever since. I\u2019m probably one of the few members of my Streatham gym who has been going regularly for more than 20 years. It\u2019s had its frustrations and losses. Back in my 40s, I was furious that no matter how hard I trained, I couldn\u2019t run as fast as I did in my 30s. Then I had to give up running altogether as my knee gave out and, after several surgeries, ended up with a metal one. So now I pound the cross trainer and pump iron in a desperate attempt to reach the levels I attained in my 50s. Like so much of my life, the act of being me has been achieved by a desire to not be me. I\u2019ve a way to go on the self-acceptance front.</p> <h2><strong>Wednesday</strong></h2> <p>After pitching up at the commandeered leisure centre to pick up my pass, going through airport security checks and getting put on a shuttle bus that drove through several heavily guarded road blocks and a perimeter fence to get to the Nato summit at a golf resort outside Watford, it later dawned on me the reason for the levels of security. It wasn\u2019t to protect the 29 Nato leaders from an outside attack, it was to prevent them from attacking each other. If the summit had lasted another day, the west could have been at war with itself. After Justin Trudeau, Boris Johnson, Princess Anne, Mark Rutte and Emmanuel Macron had all been caught on film mugging off Donald Trump at a Buckingham Palace reception the night before, the atmosphere in the compound was fairly toxic. And not just because the media were being fleeced \u00a312 for three tepid meatballs and a handful of potatoes that Ikea would have turned its nose up at. First, we had the US president throwing a strop \u2013 who would have guessed that a narcissistic bully could be so thin-skinned? - and trashing Trudeau as \u201ctwo-faced\u201d before leaving early without giving a press conference. Then Johnson went out of his way not to refer to Trump by name while insisting he hadn\u2019t been filmed in the film in which he had been filmed. At that point Dominic Cummings, who was standing to one side of the room, having previously declared he wasn\u2019t working for No 10 during the election, made a throat-slit gesture and the PM cut short his own press conference. Overhead you could hear the thunder of helicopters. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear if they were incoming gunships or an outgoing president. Taking no chances, I jumped the queue for the shuttle bus back to the station.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"41f048d82a768df0af86b9e13da5d6413f3391f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41f048d82a768df0af86b9e13da5d6413f3391f1/0_0_2188_1243/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump and Trudeau meet at the Nato summit in Watford\" width=\"1000\" height=\"568\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump: \u2018You\u2019re two-faced.\u2019 Trudeau: \u201cSure am. White face and blackface.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Thursday</strong></h2> <p>Just a week to polling day and I am counting down the days. It\u2019s hard to believe it but the election campaign has become more toxic and more depressing the longer it has gone on. Almost as if the Trump playbook is the new model for British politics. One where no voter necessarily believes very much of what any of the two main party leaders has to say but isn\u2019t that bothered because we\u2019ve reached a point where no one expects a politician to tell the truth. Not just on the big things, such as Brexit or the economy, but on the trivial too. In his interview with Julie Etchingham, Jeremy Corbyn tied himself in knots by lying about watching the Queen\u2019s speech on Christmas Day. Why do it? Literally no one would care much one way or the other. Almost no one watches the speech anymore. My mum and dad gave up some time in the 1970s. Probably around the time most members of the royal family stopped watching it. I\u2019m fairly sure that Prince Andrew will want to give it a miss this year. As for the prime minister, it\u2019s long since been priced in that any lie will do. His apology for his own Islamophobic comments on ITV1\u2019s This Morning programme was even less convincing than Corbyn\u2019s for his failure to act on antisemitism within the Labour party. It\u2019s almost as if senior figures in both parties have realised they can get away with almost anything and are hellbent on pushing it to extremes. Labour lies about how much its policies will save families, while the Tories openly invent hospitals that will never be built and fantasise about a Brexit trade deal that will take years. Only today Sajid Javid declared Labour was responsible for the rise in homelessness over the past nine years. Literally the worst lie ever. It would be nice to think that our politicians have guilty sleepless nights but somehow I doubt it. We are into a new level of pathology. One that I fear is beyond treatment.</p> <h2><strong>Friday</strong></h2> <p>I wrote recently about my father\u2019s service during the war, how he never talked about it and how, though he died more than 20 years ago, I have come to miss him more and more. One kind reader, Richard Gupwell, sent me an extract about the battle in which my father was sunk on HMS Quentin. I reproduce it in full. \u201cForce Q, comprising the cruisers Aurora, Argonaut and Sirius, accompanied by the destroyers Quentin and Quiberon intercepted a convoy off the Gulf of Tunis shortly after midnight on December 1st-2nd 1942. Admiral Cunningham writes: \u2018Engaged at point-blank range four supply ships or transports and three destroyers were sunk or set on fire. It was a ghastly scene of ships exploding and bursting into flame amidst clouds of steam and smoke; of men throwing themselves overboard as their ships sank; and motor vehicles carried on deck sliding and splashing into the sea as vessels capsized \u2026 not one ship of that convoy survived. Our submarines next morning reported large areas covered in debris and thick oil with numbers of floating corpses in lifebelts. We suffered no losses or damage during the action; but on the way back to Bone in the early dawn the <em>Quentin</em> was sunk by a torpedo from an enemy aircraft. Most of the crew were rescued by HMAS Quiberon under heavy bombing.\u2019\u201d I just wish I had made the effort to find this out when my dad was still alive.

          "bodyText": "An investigation by the Guardian reveals that an online network has found a way to make money by pushing a steady stream of low-grade rightwing propaganda at low-information users around the world. We might argue, then, that what they created was a miniature version of Facebook\u2019s own business. The investigation suggests that several deceptive operators engaged in a \u201ccovert plot to control some of Facebook\u2019s largest far right pages\u201d. But it appears they did so not for ideological reasons, but because they understood it as a way to make cash by directing ordinary users to amateurish websites dripping with ads. While under their control, the pages stepped up racist attacks on Muslims \u2014 especially female Muslim politicians like Ilhan Omar in the US and Mehreen Faruqi in Australia. They pilloried others, like Jeremy Corbyn and Justin Trudeau, who were depicted as capitulating to Islamist terror. But evidence uncovered by the investigation suggests it was less that these were true believers than that they understood that racism begets rage, which in turn leads to clicks and cash. The scheme worked in part because of the segment of users it was targeted at, those whose buttons are easily pressed. In the words of Timothy Graham, a QUT researcher interviewed for the investigation, habitu\u00e9s of such pages are prone to consume and, importantly, share \u201ccontent that is highly emotive and contains polarising and extreme material\u201d. Their willingness to smash the share button means that they are \u201cgreat for business\u201d. The retreat of tolerance; the disintegration of liberal democracies into warring, hostile camps; the flood of death threats that high profile Muslim legislators of colour receive \u2014 these are mere externalities from the point of view of the entrepreneurs of hate. Even if it\u2019s possible to clean up the mess they made, they likely won\u2019t be responsible for doing it. In all of these respects the con artists exhibited the same kind of moral bankruptcy that has led Facebook itself through a string of scandals. Facebook may not actively desire the fragmentation of polities, the rising wave of extremism and the performance of pogroms. But enraged users are engaged users, and the company\u2019s profits depend on allowing space for hate to flourish. Facebook has allowed unscrupulous companies to harvest user data for micro-targeted ads, for purposes including election interference. Facebook and other platforms it owns, like WhatsApp, were the platform of choice for those involved in genocide in Myanmar and lynchings in India. Facebook and its family of apps still provide key platforms for fascists in the west to propagandise, proselytise, and organise. But the company is, in practical terms, unrepentant. Facebook can\u2019t, won\u2019t and never will voluntarily engage in the necessary amount of proactive moderation which would inhibit hate, even if, as in this case, the enterprise appeared to be a flagrant violation of its stated rules. Facebook\u2019s profit margins depend on keeping moderation costs low, and engagement high. Its existing moderators are reportedly overworked and underpaid.

We have recorded numerous examples of more negative treatment, harsher scrutiny and slanted editorial comment about Labour\u2019s leadership, policies and record, as compared with those of the Conservative Party, and submitted them to the BBC.</p> \n  <p>\u201cUp to this point, there has been no substantive response, even though the time to address the evidence of bias is fast running out.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIn terms of balance and fairness, we have particular concerns over the Andrew Neil interviews.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIt now appears that the BBC has accepted the Conservative breach of the debates programmes package, agreed with both parties, and allowed the Conservative leader to choose an alternative interviewer.</p> \n  <p>\u201cDespite our concerns about Andrew Neil\u2019s well-known conservative political leanings, we agreed to Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s participation on the clear understanding that Boris Johnson had agreed the same terms: namely, a four-programme debates package, including a Neil interview, designed with legal oversight to ensure fairness, balance and impartiality across the campaign period.</p> \n  <p>\u201cInstead, the BBC allowed the Conservative leader to pick and choose a platform through which he believed he could present himself more favourably and without the same degree of accountability.<br></p> \n  <p> \u201cThis clearly broke the agreement the Labour Party made with the BBC in good faith.<br> \u201cBut despite raising this repeatedly with BBC editorial management, no proposal has been made to redress the imbalance that has been created.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThis imbalance is compounded almost daily by the fact that a significant amount of BBC content, on TV, radio and online, including bulletins, commentary and newspaper reviews, draws on the content and political agenda of the Conservative Party-supporting press.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe BBC does not have a role as a protagonist in the General Election.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIf the Conservatives are allowed to \u2018play\u2019 or manipulate the BBC, and this behaviour goes unchecked, then the corporation will have effectively been complicit in giving the Conservative Party an unfair electoral advantage.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI would therefore urge you to ensure that this unfairness is urgently corrected, and that the Labour Party is treated fairly and even-handedly, in relation to the governing Conservative Party in particular, in what is left of this campaign.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI attach our previous letter to your colleague Fran Unsworth, and an updated set of examples of your slanted and biased coverage of the campaign.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5de980dd8f08e7796de8d8a9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-05T22:13:07.686Z\">10.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Friday\u2019s Guardian front page</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/guardian/status/1202711735456677890\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Guardian front page, Friday 6 December 2019: The rising toll of measles: nearly 10m cases and 142,000 deaths <a href=\"https://t.co/x9Ivp9bOpU\">pic.twitter.com/x9Ivp9bOpU</a></p>\u2014 The Guardian (@guardian) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardian/status/1202711735456677890?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 5, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5de97e488f08e7796de8d8a1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-05T22:07:25.400Z\">10.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p> Addressing a rally of party faithful in Birmingham about Labour\u2019s manifesto pledges, <strong>Jeremy Corbyn </strong>appeared to mimic a line of questioning he received on <strong>Andrew Neil\u2019s</strong> BBC show.</p> \n  <p>Speaking to a room of 800-1,000 people, the Labour leader said: \u201cSo when people say to me, \u2018how are you going to pay for all this, Mr Corbyn?\u2019</p> \n  <p>\u201c\u2019How are you going to pay for it, Mr Corbyn?

Johnson has refused to accept that the overall tax burden would rise under Conservative manifesto plans - despite the fact that the party says so quite openly in its costings documents</strong></a><strong>.</strong> He was confronted on the issue by reporters because overnight the Conservative party released a briefing saying that, if it won the election, a budget in February would \u201ccut taxes for hard-working families\u201d. When reporters put it to him that the overall tax burden is set to rise in the first Tory budget, according to CCHQ\u2019s own figures (mostly because a corporation tax cut has been abandoned, and that counts as a tax rise), Johnson claimed not to be aware of this. For example, he told the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We\u2019re cutting taxes on national insurance contributions and on business rates, and I\u2019m certainly not aware of the data you describe. We\u2019re cutting taxes. And in our first budget we propose to do more to cut taxes.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>It would have been reasonable to say there is a difference between personal taxes going down and the overall taxes going up. But he didn\u2019t, and instead he just implied the journalists were wrong. Later, the Conservative party had to issue <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/dec/05/general-election-johnson-outlines-plan-for-first-100-days-as-campaign-enters-final-week-live?page=with:block-5de9312f8f08bacaf000ac7f#block-5de9312f8f08bacaf000ac7f\">what amounted to a clarification</a> \u2013 always a sign that a media appearance has not gone smoothly.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson has refused to commit to doing an interview with Andrew Neil.</strong> Asked about this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/dec/05/general-election-johnson-outlines-plan-for-first-100-days-as-campaign-enters-final-week-live?page=with:block-5de92b3a8f08eef22867e0db#block-5de92b3a8f08eef22867e0db\">at his Q&amp;A,</a> he did not say he would refuse to do the interview, but he gave the strong impression that it is never going to happen.

Ever keen to oblige, here are some more quotes.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Khan criticised Boris Johnson\u2019s response to the London Bridge terror attack, saying it was not the Tories\u2019 finest hour.</strong> There were two possible explanations for the Conservative response, he said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>One is, is just shameless politicking?</p> \n   <p>But two is, Boris Johnson and the Conservatives are going on the offensive because of some of the things they\u2019ve done in last nine years? Let me give you just a couple of examples. One, it was a Conservative government that removed the powers that judges had, for example, when there\u2019s a violent and serious offender, to give them an indeterminate sentence to protect the public. The government did this to reduce prison numbers, to save money. Secondly, it is the case that there is far less rehabilitation in prisons and far less supervision because of massive cuts made by a Conservative government. </p> \n   <p>So, you can understand why a Tory standing to be the prime minister again wants to turn a defensive posture to an offensive one. </p> \n   <p>But just pause and reflect how [the victims\u2019 families] are feeling. Just pause and reflect how the three people so seriously injured last week are feeling, to see people in positions of power and influence trying to seek political advantage out of this. On reflection, Boris Johnson and his team will think it wasn\u2019t their finest hour.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said Labour should have the \u201chumility\u201d to accept that Jewish people felt there was a genuine problem with antisemitism in the party.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I\u2019m meeting friends who are Jewish Londoners on a daily basis who feel we are a racist party and we\u2019ve got to accept that. We can\u2019t project an anti-Jeremy Corbyn or an anti-London animus towards somebody who feels we\u2019re antisemitic. They feel we\u2019re antisemitic and I accept that and I think we\u2019ve got to have the humility to realise that a small community in London \u2013 and the Jewish community is relatively small \u2013 feels really upset, feels really scared and feels really anxious. I think it\u2019s really important that we address that.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said Jeremy Corbyn had campaigned against racism all his life and had never been racist in the way Boris Johnson had.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I can point to things on the record that Boris Johnson has said about people of colour and people with different faiths: on the record, overtly, proudly, being paid for it.

Overnight, the Conservatives briefed out a story about how they would hold a budget in February \u201cwhich will cut taxes for hard-working families\u201d and this morning the Daily Telegraph and the Times both splashed on stories about the Tories offering tax cuts.</p> \n  <p>But the Tories have already published details of their tax plans, and they show that, although personal taxes would go down in their first budget, the overall tax burden would rise because they have cancelled a planned cut in corporation tax. (In budget terms, that counts as a tax rise.) Overall, the cuts and the increases for 2020-21 effectively balance out, but the tax increase total (\u00a33,320m) is bigger than the tax cut total (\u00a33,195m), making a net increase in the tax burden of \u00a35m.</p> \n  <p>This is perfectly defensible. You can argue that the personal tax burden is not the same as the overall tax burden. You could also argue that a tax cut forgone is not the same as a tax rise (although economists will tell you that it is).</p> \n  <p>But Johnson did not do either of these things. Instead, when asked about these figures, he claimed not to know what they were, and refused to accept that the overall tax burden would rise. </p> \n  <p>The BBC\u2019s political editor, <strong>Laura Kuenssberg</strong>, first raised this point. She put it to Johnson that he was saying he would cut taxes in February, when overall his manifesto said taxes would go up. Johnson did not accept this. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I don\u2019t know what you are talking about ... We\u2019re cutting taxes on business rates, we\u2019re cutting national insurance contributions for everybody in the country, everybody paying NICs.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>When Kuenssberg pushed him on this again, saying that overall taxes would go up, he claimed not to recognise the data. He told her:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We\u2019re cutting taxes on national insurance contributions and on business rates, and I\u2019m certainly not aware of the data you describe. We\u2019re cutting taxes. And in our first budget we propose to do more to cut taxes. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Later <strong>Liz Bates</strong> from Channel 4 News made the same point, and asked Johnson why he was not willing to admit that taxes would go up when it said so in black and white in his manifesto. He replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Because it\u2019s absolutely not right. We have got a manifesto that commits us to cutting national insurance contributions for everybody in the country.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Here is the chart from <a href=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5da42e2cae7ebd3f8bde353c/5ddaa257967a3b50273283c4_Conservative%202019%20Costings.pdf\">the Tory manifesto costing document (pdf)</a> showing the party\u2019s proposed tax cuts.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"52de714eed3eb36bb62af44aee9533cca1121a7d\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52de714eed3eb36bb62af44aee9533cca1121a7d/0_0_753_421/500.jpg\" alt=\"Tory manifesto tax cuts\" width=\"500\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tory manifesto tax cuts</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: CCHQ</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>And here is the chart from the same documents showing the proposed tax increases.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fd507a2d3d0d653ba90ca348700c0ab0c15f639f\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd507a2d3d0d653ba90ca348700c0ab0c15f639f/0_0_754_351/500.jpg\" alt=\"Tory tax rises\" width=\"500\" height=\"233\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tory tax rises</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: CCHQ</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>In <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10477306/boris-johnson-gruelling-camping-trail/\">an article with the Sun</a> about his daily routine during the campaign Johnson joked that, when he needed to relax at night, he resorted to \u201ca few quadratic equations\u201d.

With Jeremy Corbyn, it\u2019s for antisemitism. With Jo Swinson, it\u2019s for her record in coalition. And with <strong>Boris Johnson</strong> - well, there is quite a choice, but racist, homophobic or otherwise offensive comments made by him in newspaper columns tend to come at the top of the list. </p> \n  <p>(Note to younger readers: election campaigns didn\u2019t always used to be like this.)</p> \n  <p>Johnson was on ITV\u2019s This Morning a few minutes ago. Two days ago the presenter Phillip Schofield managed to get <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/video/2019/dec/03/jeremy-corbyn-on-antisemitism-in-labour-obviously-im-very-sorry-video\">an apology out of Corbyn</a>. Today he managed the same with Johnson.</p> \n  <p>Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson apologised for describing women wearing burqas as looking like letterboxes. </strong>Unlike many of the other comments in previous newspaper articles for which he is being criticised, Johnson wrote this relatively recently, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/aug/06/boris-johnsons-burqa-remarks-fan-flames-of-islamophobia-says-mp\">in the summer last year.</a> Asked whether he would say sorry for the offence caused, he replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I have already said sorry for any offence that I\u2019ve caused, and I say it again.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Johnson has not always been willing to apologise for these comments. When Fiona Bruce asked him to apologise for these comments in the BBC Question Time leaders\u2019 special two weeks ago,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/22/general-election-2019-corbyn-tells-voters-to-make-sure-their-voice-is-heard-live-news?page=with:block-5dd85c2e8f080fd59fb15acc#block-5dd85c2e8f080fd59fb15acc\"> he refused</a>. But on Friday last week, in a phone-in on LBC, Johnson did issued a generalised apology. Asked about Islamophobia in the Conservative party, he said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I apologise ... Many people who will point out I have said things that have caused offence. Well, I\u2019m deeply sorry for the offence that I caused.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson said claims that the NHS would be on the table in trade talks with the US was as implausible as stories about UFOs. </strong>When it was put to him that there was a dossier showing the NHS had been discussed in talks, he replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>And there are photographs that purport to prove there are UFOs.

He writes:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Mr Longworth was unavailable for comment last night but an insider said: \u2018We can\u2019t support a party that jeopardises Brexit.</p> \n   <p>\u2018Too many people are concerned about their own egos rather than the cause we have all been campaigning for: to leave the EU.</p> \n   <p>\u2018It has become increasingly clear that unless the Tories win next week, Brexit is doomed.

It triumphed because Theresa May\u2019s failure to pass a Brexit deal, and her decision to accept a Brexit extension, made it hard for Brexiters to vote for the Tories.

Four Brexit party MEPs have held a news conference to explain why they are leaving the party and urging people to vote Conservative. They are Annunziata Rees-Mogg (whose brother Jacob is a Conservative cabinet minister), Lance Forman, Lucy Harris and John Longworth. Johnson has insisted he will get a trade deal with the EU by the end of next year - but refused to give a \u201ccast-iron guarantee\u201d to that effect. In an interview this morning Sajid Javid, the chancellor, refused to rule out a no-deal Brexit happening at the end of 2020, although he said the prospect was \u201cextremely remote\u201d. Johnson has apologised \u201cfor any offence caused\u201d by his article describing Muslim women who wear a face-covering veil as looking like \u201cletterboxes\u201d and \u201cbank robbers\u201d. Scores of serving and former Labour officials have given sworn statements about antisemitism in the party as part of evidence submitted to the Equality and Human Rights Commission\u2019s investigation into the issue. Labour\u2019s Jon Ashworth pulled out of the final pre-election episode of BBC Question Time, after the programme was criticised for featuring an all-male panel. John McDonnell has disclosed that Labour will not negotiate with smaller parties in the event of a hung parliament next week. The shadow chancellor told The Financial Times: \u201cWe will implement our manifesto...no negotiation, no deal, no coalitions. \u201cWe\u2019ll roll out our programme and let\u2019s see if the Lib Dems vote against the real living wage at 10 an hour, let\u2019s see if the SNP vote against the proposals we brought forward for ending austerity.\u201d Business leaders are calling for a number of commitments from the next government to help firms deal with Brexit. The Institute of Directors said details on international trade must be a priority in the coming months. The group said companies should be given an \u201cadjustment period\u201d before any new relationship with the EU comes into effect. Meanwhile, analysis suggests that none of the main political parties have a properly evidence-based strategy to meet their ambitions on education policy. The Education Policy Institute (EPI), funded by the Nuffield Foundation, carried out an analysis of the manifesto education plans of the Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats, Greens and the Brexit Party, assessing how their policies would affect England. Researchers found that although all parties have made bold pledges about reducing opportunity gaps and raising educational attainment, the policies in their manifestos are unlikely to deliver on these aspirations.

Conservative chairman James Cleverly speaking about the UK\u2019s EU membership on Question Time. More than 100 pro-EU groups have sent a letter to Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson asking her to back Labour in the Prime Minister\u2019s constituency. The letter promises that if the Lib Dems step back in Boris Johnson\u2019s constituency of Uxbridge and South Ruislip in London, the grass roots groups will pile pressure on Labour to pull back in Esher and Walton in Surrey where Lib Dem candidate Monica Harding is up against Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab. The 134 groups that have signed the \u201cBoot Out Boris\u201d letter \u201cwant to change the dynamics of the election\u201d. The letter to Swinson says: \u201cWe know we are asking you a lot to help Labour without any reason to think Jeremy Corbyn will return the favour. But if Johnson wins a majority, he\u2019ll drag us out of the EU. So we implore you to look to the national interest. \u201cWe also know you are already only running a paper candidate in Uxbridge. But we want you to go further and support Labour there. \u201cA similar letter is being sent to Corbyn asking Labour to support the Lib Dems in Esher and Walton, where you can bring down Dominic Raab. \u201cBut to be clear, we don\u2019t want you to wait for him to say yes. Time is terribly short, so we want you to take unilateral action.\u201d Boris Johnson has written to Jeremy Corbyn accusing him of a \u201csly\u201d plan to \u201cfiddle\u201d a second Brexit referendum. The prime minister has urged the Labour leader to reconsider his Brexit policy and his plan to give full voting rights to all UK residents with Johnson saying it would give two million EU nationals the vote in another referendum. Johnson said Corbyn\u2019s approach has \u201calready done serious harm to trust\u201d in politics, adding that cancelling the result of the 2016 referendum before it has been implemented would do more damage. Labour has said it will \u201cgive the people the final say\u201d on Brexit, that within three months of coming to power a Labour government would secure a \u201csensible deal\u201d, and within six months they will put that deal to a public vote alongside the option to remain. Cat Smith, Labour\u2019s shadow minister for voter engagement, said: \u201cThe Labour Party believes in democracy. We welcome securing a new and better Brexit deal, and putting it back to the people to have the final say. \u201cIf Boris Johnson had any confidence in his own deal, he would have let it be scrutinised by Parliament, and then put it back before the people for their verdict.\u201d Friday\u2019s Financial Times front page Nationalising UK energy companies would delay the UK\u2019s move towards a zero carbon future, according to the chief executive of Scottish Power. Keith Anderson said investment by the private sector had seen the cost of renewable energy fall over the last decade and that debates about nationalisation would only serve as a distraction from preventing a climate emergency. A Labour spokesman told the BBC Anderson\u2019s comments are \u201chardly surprising\u201d as they represent \u201cvested interests\u201d. A Labour government would set up a network of advisers based in Post Offices to support small businesses if the party wins the General Election. Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey said the new Business Development Agency would act as a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d offering advice, finance and large-scale government contracts, and is part of a \u201c20-point plan\u201d to support small businesses. Another Labour policy is to set up a Post Office bank, and a network of business advisers would operate out of larger Post Bank branches to give advice and guidance for local businesses on how to access support and finance. Labour is also planning a 250 billion UK national investment bank, and network of regional and national development banks, to give small businesses and the industries of the future the funding they need. The party also wants to give free full-fibre broadband to every business premises, scrap quarterly reporting for businesses with a turnover of under 85,000, and reform business rates. On the Labour proposals to support small businesses, International Trade Secretary Liz Truss said: \u201cDespite what they claim, Labour are not on the side of small businesses. \u201cTheir plans to raise corporation tax and introduce a four-day week will hit businesses hard. \u201cSMEs don\u2019t need a new quango, they need certainty. All Corbyn\u2019s Labour will bring is higher taxes and uncertainty with no plan for Brexit and the chaos of two more referendums next year. \u201cOnly a majority Conservative government can provide the certainty businesses need, get Brexit done and bring costs down for SMEs by cutting business rates so that they can realise their potential.\u201d Liberal Democrat business spokesman Sam Gyimah said: \u201cSMEs up and down the country have made it abundantly clear that any form of Brexit - be it red or blue - will harm their ability to hire staff, make it more difficult to export to our closest partners and ratchet up the cost of doing business. \u201cSo while Labour wants to claim that it is on the side of small businesses, its support for Brexit means that ultimately these plans ring hollow. The simple fact is that you cannot be both pro-Brexit and pro-business. \u201cIt is only the Liberal Democrats who will stop Brexit and bring forward a bold vision to support small businesses in the UK, including by scrapping the outdated business rates regime.\u201d The Liberal Democrats have pledged funding for disadvantaged pre-school children will be tripled if they triumph in the General Election. The party said funding would be boosted for children aged three and four attending nurseries and other childcare providers. Introduced by the Lib Dems in 2015, the Early Years Pupil Premium (EYPP) gives childcare providers up to 302 extra a year for all disadvantaged children aged three and four they look after, the party said, adding that around 99,000 children a year benefitted from the extra funding. The Lib Dems said they would triple the EYPP to 1,000 per child, costing between 65 million and 70 million in 2024/25. It has also pledged to support families on low incomes by investing one billion a year in children\u2019s centres, improving the quality of staff in early years settings by requiring all providers to have a staff training programme, and providing 35 hours of free childcare from the day parents go back to work to the day their child starts school. Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson said: \u201cThe achievement gap between richer and poorer children can best be closed in the early years. \u201cBut under the Conservatives, it\u2019s widening. We cannot allow disadvantaged children to be left behind before they have even started school. \u201cLiberal Democrats will transform the lives of families with a massive expansion of free, high-quality childcare. \u201cAt the same time, we\u2019ll give nurseries more money dedicated to supporting children from the poorest families and children in care. \u201cBy investing in the early years, we can give every child a great start in life.\u201d Friday\u2019s Metro front page focusing on Andrew Neil\u2019s challenge to the prime minister Tomorrow\u2019s Telegraph splash Friday\u2019s Times front page focusing on the Brexit party Labour has complained to the BBC\u2019s director general, Tony Hall, accusing the broadcaster of \u201cslanted and biased\u201d election coverage. The party claims to have examples of where Labour\u2019s leadership and policies have faced \u201cmore negative treatment\u201d and \u201charsher scrutiny\u201d by the BBC compared to those of the Conservative Party. Labour\u2019s co-campaign coordinator Andrew Gwynne also raised concern about Boris Johnson\u2019s \u201cfailure\u201d to be interviewed by BBC\u2019s Andrew Neil. A BBC spokesman said: \u201cThe BBC will continue to make its own independent editorial decisions, and is committed to reporting the election campaign fairly, impartially and without fear or favour.\u201d Here is the letter in full from Gwynne: \u201cI am writing to raise the Labour Party\u2019s serious concerns over the BBC\u2019s coverage of the General Election campaign, which we believe has repeatedly shown bias in its reporting of the Labour Party and its leadership, and demonstrated a worrying failure to meet the BBC\u2019s obligations to fairness and impartiality. \u201cThat bias has been reflected in the framing, content and balance of BBC reporting during the campaign. We have recorded numerous examples of more negative treatment, harsher scrutiny and slanted editorial comment about Labour\u2019s leadership, policies and record, as compared with those of the Conservative Party, and submitted them to the BBC. \u201cUp to this point, there has been no substantive response, even though the time to address the evidence of bias is fast running out. \u201cIn terms of balance and fairness, we have particular concerns over the Andrew Neil interviews. \u201cIt now appears that the BBC has accepted the Conservative breach of the debates programmes package, agreed with both parties, and allowed the Conservative leader to choose an alternative interviewer. \u201cDespite our concerns about Andrew Neil\u2019s well-known conservative political leanings, we agreed to Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s participation on the clear understanding that Boris Johnson had agreed the same terms: namely, a four-programme debates package, including a Neil interview, designed with legal oversight to ensure fairness, balance and impartiality across the campaign period. \u201cInstead, the BBC allowed the Conservative leader to pick and choose a platform through which he believed he could present himself more favourably and without the same degree of accountability. \u201cThis clearly broke the agreement the Labour Party made with the BBC in good faith. \u201cBut despite raising this repeatedly with BBC editorial management, no proposal has been made to redress the imbalance that has been created. \u201cThis imbalance is compounded almost daily by the fact that a significant amount of BBC content, on TV, radio and online, including bulletins, commentary and newspaper reviews, draws on the content and political agenda of the Conservative Party-supporting press. \u201cThe BBC does not have a role as a protagonist in the General Election. \u201cIf the Conservatives are allowed to \u2018play\u2019 or manipulate the BBC, and this behaviour goes unchecked, then the corporation will have effectively been complicit in giving the Conservative Party an unfair electoral advantage. \u201cI would therefore urge you to ensure that this unfairness is urgently corrected, and that the Labour Party is treated fairly and even-handedly, in relation to the governing Conservative Party in particular, in what is left of this campaign. \u201cI attach our previous letter to your colleague Fran Unsworth, and an updated set of examples of your slanted and biased coverage of the campaign.\u201d Friday\u2019s Guardian front page Addressing a rally of party faithful in Birmingham about Labour\u2019s manifesto pledges, Jeremy Corbyn appeared to mimic a line of questioning he received on Andrew Neil\u2019s BBC show. Speaking to a room of 800-1,000 people, the Labour leader said: \u201cSo when people say to me, \u2018how are you going to pay for all this, Mr Corbyn?\u2019 \u201c\u2019How are you going to pay for it, Mr Corbyn? Come on, answer it, answer it, answer it!\u2019 he added, drawing laughs from the crowd. \u201c\u2019You\u2019ve got no answer for it, have you?\u201d\u2019 He said: \u201cWe\u2019ve got our grey book and every single line of our manifesto has been read through, carefully, and fully costed.\u201d Corbyn also insisted there was \u201cno place whatsoever\u201d for anti-Semitism within Labour. He said: \u201cI remember when Enoch Powell was in the West Midlands, I remember the viciousness of that whole period. \u201cI simply say this: in our society, in our moment, there is no place whatsoever for anti-Semitism, Islamophobia or racism. \u201cSo in the last weeks of this election campaign, when everything will be thrown at us by those that are rich and powerful, we\u2019re going to be out there on every street, every town, every city, with our message. \u201cA message of hope, a message of inclusion, a message of a society that is based on the needs of all of us and of social justice for all.\u201d Donald Tusk, the former European Council president, told The Guardian the Brexit campaign is an example of \u201cthe unprecedented readiness to lie\u201d in modern politics. He said Brexit has been \u201cone of the most spectacular mistakes\u201d in the history of the EU and \u201cthe most painful and saddest experience\u201d of his time in office. Labour has complained to the BBC\u2019s director general, Tony Hall, accusing the broadcaster of \u201cslanted and biased\u201d election coverage. The party claims to have examples of where Labour\u2019s leadership and policies have faced \u201cmore negative treatment\u201d and \u201charsher scrutiny\u201d by the BBC compared to those of the Conservative Party. Labour\u2019s co-campaign coordinator Andrew Gwynne also raised concern about Boris Johnson\u2019s \u201cfailure\u201d to be interviewed by BBC\u2019s Andrew Neil. Gwynne said the party agreed to Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s interview with Neil based on the \u201cclear understanding\u201d that Johnson had agreed the same terms. \u201cInstead, the BBC allowed the Conservative leader to pick and choose a platform through which he believed he could present himself more favourably and without the same degree of accountability,\u201d Gwynne said in the letter. A BBC spokesman said: \u201cThe BBC will continue to make its own independent editorial decisions, and is committed to reporting the election campaign fairly, impartially and without fear or favour.\u201d At The Custard Factory, Jeremy Corbyn said he is \u201cinspired\u201d by the ambitions of the children he\u2019s met - but also saddened by the difficulties they and their \u201cstressed-out\u201d teachers have faced as they struggle with a \u201clack of funds\u201d. \u201cNone of this is necessary, none of this is right,\u201d he added. All of this is part of Labour\u2019s promotion of education proposals which include capping class sizes by recruiting 20,000 extra teachers. Nigel Farage has criticised the three MEPs who abandoned his Brexit party today seven days before polling day in an interview with Andrew Neil. Annunziata Rees-Mogg \u2013 sister of the Commons leader, Jacob Rees-Mogg \u2013 Lance Forman and Lucy Harris all resigned the whip to back Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal. Ahead of Jeremy Corbyn taking the stage at the Labour rally in Birmingham, the singer Jamelia spoke about how her daughter almost died as a newborn but because of the NHS, she is alive. The television presenter said her daughter is nearly two and \u201call she wants for her birthday is a Labour government\u201d. Jeremy Corbyn is due to speak shortly at The Custard Factory in Birmingham. Andrew Neil said the prime minister tells us he has always been an opponent of austerity but we would ask him for evidence of that. In the final part of his monologue, he said: \u201cAnd we would want to know why an opponent of austerity would bake so much of it into their future spending plans. \u201cWe would ask why, as with the proposed increase in police numbers, so many of his promises only take us back to the future, back to where we were before austerity began. \u201cSocial care is an issue of growing concern. On the steps of Downing Street in July he said he\u2019d prepared a plan for social care. We\u2019d ask him why that plan is not in his manifesto. \u201cQuestions of trust. Questions we\u2019d like to put to Mr Johnson so you can hear his replies. But we can\u2019t, because he won\u2019t sit down with us. \u201cThere is no law, no supreme court ruling, that can force Mr Johnson to participate in a BBC leaders\u2019 interview. But the prime minister of our nation will, at times, have to stand up to President Trump, President Putin, President Xi of China. \u201cSo it was surely not expecting too much that he spend half an hour standing up to me.\u201d More from Andrew Neil on his intervention which came after his interview with Nigel Farage. He said: \u201cCan he be believed when he claims another 34 [hospitals] will be built in the five years after that? \u201cCan he be trusted to fund the NHS properly, when he used a cash figure of an extra \u00a334bn? \u201cAfter inflation, the additional money promised amounts to \u00a320bn. \u201cHe vows that the NHS will not be on the table with any trade talks with America. But he vowed to the DUP, his unionist allies in Northern Ireland, that there would never be a border down the Irish Sea. \u201cThat is as important to the DUP as the NHS is to the rest of us. It is a vow his Brexit deal would seem to break.\u201d Here is the full transcript of Andrew Neil\u2019s challenge to Boris Johnson to commit to an interview with him with just one week before polling day. Talking about his leader interviews, the veteran broadcaster said: \u201cThere is of course still one to be done - Boris Johnson, the prime minister. \u201cWe have been asking him for weeks now to give us a date, a time, a venue. As of now, none has been forthcoming. \u201cNo broadcaster can compel a politician to be interviewed. But leaders\u2019 interviews have been a key part of the BBC\u2019s prime-time election coverage for decades. \u201cWe do them on your behalf to scrutinise and hold to account those who would govern us. That is democracy.\u201d Neil added: \u201cWe\u2019ve always proceeded in good faith that the leaders would participate. And in every election they have. All of them. Until this one. \u201cIt is not too late. We have interview prepared. Oven-ready, as Mr Johnson likes to say. \u201cThe theme running through our questions is trust, and why at so many times in his career, in politics and journalism, critics and sometimes even those close to him have deemed him to be untrustworthy. \u201cIt is of course relevant to what he is promising us all now. \u201cCan he be trusted to deliver 50,000 more nurses? When almost 20,000 in his numbers are already working for the NHS. \u201cHe promises 40 new hospitals. But only six are scheduled to be built by 2025.\u201d Reaction to Andrew Neil issuing a direct challenge to Boris Johnson to face him one-on-one, and the prime minister yet to agree a date for the BBC interview. Jeremy Corbyn did not directly respond to the question over whether he would resign if Labour does not win next week\u2019s election. It comes after Lord Falconer called for him to resign if Labour are unsuccessful while Len McCluskey, from the Unite union, said Corbyn should remain. Corbyn told ITV: \u201cI am leading the party to win the election, I am utterly determined to win the election.\u201d At a Liberal Democrat campaign rally in Edinburgh, which featured a \u201ctopple Boris\u201d coconut shy, a \u201cSwinzone\u201d selfie area and rather unseasonal free ice cream, Jo Swinson told activists she was glad to be back in Scotland and attacked the government still sitting just down the road at the Holyrood parliament. \u201cThe SNP try to pretend that if you\u2019re against independence, you\u2019re somehow against Scotland. They are wrong,\u201d she told the audience, before taking the SNP government to task for their record on health, education and policing. \u201cIt\u2019s been a tough week for the SNP headline-wise, with the ongoing infections crisis at Glasgow\u2019s flagship hospital, poor results in the Pisa schools study, and the resignation of the chair of the Scottish Police Authority, Susan Deacon, as she criticised police accountability and governance as \u2018fundamentally flawed\u2019.\u201d To laughter, she added: \u201cBoris Johnson says he is committed to our family of nations. But we all know that he\u2019s never been much of a family man.\u201d Corbyn was asked by ITV what his stance on Brexit was. He responded: \u201cA credible leave option maintains credible trading relations with Europe, the sale and manufacture of goods, a customs agreement that protects the Good Friday agreement. \u201cWe would support either remain or leave with the economic relationship with Europe intact.\u201d The Labour leader added he would not support Scotland having a second referendum on independence. Corbyn has reiterated his apology over the antisemitism allegations that have engulfed his party. He told ITV: \u201cAntisemitism is a vile evil. I have spent my life campaigning against racism. \u201cWhere there has been a delay in processing [cases], I apologise to the people who suffered as a result of it.\u201d On safety and security following the London Bridge attack last week, Jeremy Corbyn told ITV \u201cwhat concerns me is automatic release\u201d for people convicted of serious offences. He added his priority is a \u201cproperly funded prison service and probation service\u201d which is able to intervene. In an interview with ITV\u2019s Tonight programme, Jeremy Corbyn responded to his standing in the opinion polls. He said: \u201cI never comment on opinion polls. \u201cI behave as leader of the party. Yes, I have had a lot of attacks from the media. \u201cI don\u2019t indulge in personal abuse.\u201d Andrew Neil has urged Boris Johnson to commit to a BBC interview with him to face questions on why people have \u201cdeemed him to be untrustworthy\u201d. At the end of an interview with the Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, Neil \u2013 who was Johnson\u2019s former boss at the Spectator \u2013 said: \u201cIt is not too late. We have an interview prepared. Oven-ready, as Mr Johnson likes to say.\u201d Neil said Johnson was the only party leader who had not agreed to be interviewed, adding: \u201cWe have been asking him for weeks now to give us a date, time ... as of now none have been forthcoming. \u201cNo broadcaster can compel a politician to be interviewed but leaders\u2019 interviews have been a key part of the BBC\u2019s primetime election coverage for decades \u2026 to hold to account, on your behalf, those who would govern us. That is democracy. \u201cWe\u2019ve always proceeded in good faith that the leaders would participate and in every election they have - until this one.\u201d Talks between trade unions and the Department of Health to prevent industrial action have ended without agreement. Health workers in Northern Ireland have been taking part in action over pay and staffing levels. There has been strike action as well as work-to-rule across the week, causing thousands of operations and appointments to be cancelled. Negotiators from four trade unions which represent health workers and nurses held a three-hour meeting with the Department of Health in Belfast on Thursday. The Northern Ireland secretary, Julian Smith, who met the unions before their talks with the department, welcomed its fresh offer. But speaking on behalf of the unions, Anne Speed from Unison said it was \u201cinsufficient\u201d. \u201cDespite the tweet from the secretary of state earlier this evening in the middle of discussions before the meeting concluded, our position is as follows: The department has presented a new position, trade unions have jointly agreed this remains insufficient and falls short of our members\u2019 requirements and mandate that they have given us,\u201d she said. \u201cIndustrial action continues and joint planned trade union action remains in place for December 18.\u201d Nigel Farage has criticised the MEPs who left the party today to campaign for Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal. Farage said Annunziata Rees-Mogg, sister to the Commons leader, Jacob, and one of those to walk out, was \u201cwrong\u201d to suggest the Brexit party could put Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union \u201cat risk\u201d by contesting Labour-held seats. He countered by arguing it was the Tories that were guilty of potentially splitting the leave vote, by contesting constituencies such as Doncaster, Barnsley and Hartlepool where voters were \u201cunlikely\u201d to go blue. Lance Forman and Lucy Harris also left the party while John Longworth lost the whip on Wednesday for criticising the party\u2019s election strategy. One of the big developments of the day has been three MEPs leaving the Brexit party and urging voters to back the Conservatives . One of them, Lucy Harris, said her decision was based on her belief that only Labour and the Tories could win next week\u2019s election. She told the BBC that Labour\u2019s policy to deliver a second EU referendum would mean making a decision between a \u201cbotched-up Brexit deal\u201d and remaining in the EU and that it was therefore \u201ctoo risky\u201d to do anything other than vote for Boris Johnson. Earlier, the Brexit Party leader, Nigel Farage, pointed to links between the three MEPs and the Conservatives. Boris Johnson has refused to accept that the overall tax burden would rise under Conservative manifesto plans - despite the fact that the party says so quite openly in its costings documents. He was confronted on the issue by reporters because overnight the Conservative party released a briefing saying that, if it won the election, a budget in February would \u201ccut taxes for hard-working families\u201d. When reporters put it to him that the overall tax burden is set to rise in the first Tory budget, according to CCHQ\u2019s own figures (mostly because a corporation tax cut has been abandoned, and that counts as a tax rise), Johnson claimed not to be aware of this. For example, he told the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg: We\u2019re cutting taxes on national insurance contributions and on business rates, and I\u2019m certainly not aware of the data you describe. We\u2019re cutting taxes. And in our first budget we propose to do more to cut taxes. It would have been reasonable to say there is a difference between personal taxes going down and the overall taxes going up. But he didn\u2019t, and instead he just implied the journalists were wrong. Later, the Conservative party had to issue what amounted to a clarification \u2013 always a sign that a media appearance has not gone smoothly. Johnson has refused to commit to doing an interview with Andrew Neil. Asked about this at his Q&amp;A, he did not say he would refuse to do the interview, but he gave the strong impression that it is never going to happen. This evening it has emerged that he definitely won\u2019t be doing a sit-down interview with ITV\u2019s Julie Etchingham either. Jeremy Corbyn has given interviews to both Neil and Etchingham \u2013 although both generated multiple negative headlines, which of course explains why Johnson is evading this level of scrutiny. Four Brexit party MEPs have held a news conference to explain why they are leaving the party and urging people to vote Conservative. They are Annunziata Rees-Mogg (whose brother Jacob is a Conservative cabinet minister), Lance Forman, Lucy Harris and John Longworth. They worry that by continuing to stand in Tory target seats, Nigel Farage\u2019s party could be helping Labour. Last month Farage said he would not put up candidates in 317 Tory-won seats because he was worried about a minority Labour government eventually cancelling Brexit, and the rebel \u201cgang of four\u201d argued that backing the Tories everywhere was the logical extension. Farage has rejected this, claiming there are seats where the Brexit party is actually helping the Tories by standing. Students of Farage\u2019s career will recall that the last party he led, Ukip, also ended up riven by splits. Johnson has insisted he will get a trade deal with the EU by the end of next year - but refused to give a \u201ccast-iron guarantee\u201d to that effect. In an interview this morning Sajid Javid, the chancellor, refused to rule out a no-deal Brexit happening at the end of 2020, although he said the prospect was \u201cextremely remote\u201d. Johnson has apologised \u201cfor any offence caused\u201d by his article describing Muslim women who wear a face-covering veil as looking like \u201cletterboxes\u201d and \u201cbank robbers\u201d. Scores of serving and former Labour officials have given sworn statements about antisemitism in the party as part of evidence submitted to the Equality and Human Rights Commission\u2019s investigation into the issue. Labour\u2019s Jon Ashworth has pulled out of the final pre-election episode of BBC Question Time, after the programme was criticised for featuring an all-male panel. That\u2019s all from me this evening. My colleague Nadeem Badshah is in charge of the blog now. There is a Jeremy Corbyn rally at 7pm. The Andrew Neil interview with Nigel Farage is going out at 7pm too. And Julie Etchingham\u2019s interview with Jeremy Corbyn is being broadcast at 7.30pm. My colleague Hilary Osborne has written a Factcheck piece on who is responsible for the increase in homelessness, following comments made by the chancellor, Sajid Javid. On Boris Johnson not appearing on the Tonight programme, a spokesman for ITV said: \u201cThe ITV News team making the Boris Johnson Tonight film made the original bid for the prime minister when the election was called. \u201cThey have contacted his press team on repeated occasions with times and dates offered to film an interview. \u201cBoris Johnson\u2019s team have today confirmed he will not be taking part. \u201cThe programme will instead feature a profile of the prime minister using fresh interviews with other contributors and archive footage.\u201d My colleague Jim Waterson\u2019s reaction to the news that Boris Johnson will not be following suit and taking part in an interview with ITV News. ITV said: \u201cEvery other leader of Great Britain\u2019s main political parties that has been approached has done an interview for Tonight.\u201d The prime minister has faced mounting criticism of his refusal to be interviewed by Andrew Neil on the BBC. Nicola Sturgeon has said she believes tactical voting could be key to stopping Boris Johnson getting a majority and that \u201cpeople are thinking very carefully\u201d about how to vote. Scotland\u2019s first minister said she felt there may be more tactical voting at this general election than ever before as she urged voters to oust Conservative MPs in Scotland by voting for the Scottish National party. She said: \u201cThe way to escape that mess and to focus on building a better Scotland is to make sure that the Tories and Boris Johnson don\u2019t get that majority they\u2019re looking for. \u201cIn this election people are thinking very carefully, I think there will be potentially more tactical voting than we\u2019ve seen in previous general elections, and in Scotland if you want to vote tactically to stop the Tories, then the way to do that is to vote SNP - we\u2019re the challenger in all the Tory-held seats.\u201d More on the controversy over Boris Johnson taking a selfie with This Morning presenters Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby using a Huawei smartphone, despite security concerns around the Chinese company. Schofield has waded in on Twitter in response to criticism. Responding to fans who asked whether he had challenged Johnson over comments which some claim are Islamophobic, the host replied: \u201cYES!!\u201d Ofcom said it had received 31 complaints about the interview as of this afternoon. Earlier in the comments bagillt was asking for some more detail of what Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London, said in his LBC phone-in this morning. Ever keen to oblige, here are some more quotes. Khan criticised Boris Johnson\u2019s response to the London Bridge terror attack, saying it was not the Tories\u2019 finest hour. There were two possible explanations for the Conservative response, he said: One is, is just shameless politicking? But two is, Boris Johnson and the Conservatives are going on the offensive because of some of the things they\u2019ve done in last nine years? Let me give you just a couple of examples. One, it was a Conservative government that removed the powers that judges had, for example, when there\u2019s a violent and serious offender, to give them an indeterminate sentence to protect the public. The government did this to reduce prison numbers, to save money. Secondly, it is the case that there is far less rehabilitation in prisons and far less supervision because of massive cuts made by a Conservative government. So, you can understand why a Tory standing to be the prime minister again wants to turn a defensive posture to an offensive one. But just pause and reflect how [the victims\u2019 families] are feeling. Just pause and reflect how the three people so seriously injured last week are feeling, to see people in positions of power and influence trying to seek political advantage out of this. On reflection, Boris Johnson and his team will think it wasn\u2019t their finest hour. He said Labour should have the \u201chumility\u201d to accept that Jewish people felt there was a genuine problem with antisemitism in the party. He said: I\u2019m meeting friends who are Jewish Londoners on a daily basis who feel we are a racist party and we\u2019ve got to accept that. We can\u2019t project an anti-Jeremy Corbyn or an anti-London animus towards somebody who feels we\u2019re antisemitic. They feel we\u2019re antisemitic and I accept that and I think we\u2019ve got to have the humility to realise that a small community in London \u2013 and the Jewish community is relatively small \u2013 feels really upset, feels really scared and feels really anxious. I think it\u2019s really important that we address that. He said Jeremy Corbyn had campaigned against racism all his life and had never been racist in the way Boris Johnson had. He said: I can point to things on the record that Boris Johnson has said about people of colour and people with different faiths: on the record, overtly, proudly, being paid for it. [Can] you point to examples where Jeremy Corbyn has said things on the record, in articles, in speeches, for a cheap joke, about people of colour or people of different faiths? The Conservatives received donations of more than \u00a33m in the third week of the general election campaign - far outstripping the other parties, PA Media reports. The Electoral Commission said the Tories reported donations of more than \u00a37,500 totalling \u00a33.59m in the week from 20-26 November. In contrast, Labour received \u00a3521,909, the Liberal Democrats \u00a3509,998 and the Brexit party received no donations over 7,500 at all. The Green party reported donations of \u00a3100,000, and the Alliance party of Northern Ireland \u00a315,000. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, has criticised Boris Johnson for \u201cevading scrutiny\u201d in the general election campaign. At an event in South Queensferry she said: Boris Johnson has ducked and dived, evading scrutiny throughout this whole campaign and no wonder because everybody knows that if he gets his way he drags Scotland out of the EU against our will, out of the single market and the customs union, plunging us into the next round of Brexit chaos that could cost every person in our country \u00a31,600 and a process that could end with a no-deal Brexit later next year. She has also unveiled the Scottish National party battlebus. Given that \u201cStop Brexit\u201d is also a Lib Dem slogan, this is probably the design the Lib Dems should have chosen for their battlebus. (Instead the Lib Dems opted for an enormous picture of Jo Swinson, which was probably a mistake because she has turned out to be less of an asset than the party expected.) The Conservative party has put out a statement clarifying its position on taxes - ie, saying what Boris Johnson would have said in his Q&amp;A earlier if he had been more honest about the party\u2019s plans. (See 3.57pm.) A spokesman said: Our manifesto does not propose increasing taxes on UK resident companies and would not put up personal taxes for hard-working Brits. We have been very clear that we are pausing future corporation tax cuts, and will invest this money into our NHS. We will also introduce a surcharge on those buying UK property from abroad, increase the immigration health surcharge so everyone contributes to our NHS and put up taxes on plastic bags to help our environment. Here are the main points from Boris Johnson\u2019s Q&amp;A in Matlock. Johnson refused to accept that the Conservative party\u2019s own costings show the overall tax burden will increase under their plans. (See 3.57pm.) He rejected claims that his pledge to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d by 31 January was misleading because 2020 would be consumed by Brexit negotiations with the EU. This point was put to Johnson twice, but he refused to accept it. He said the situation would be different after January because the \u201cparliamentary wrangling and bitterness and feuding\u201d would be over. For a good explanation of why Johnson may be wrong, and why 2020 could end up being dominated again by news about a possible no-deal Brexit, do read this Twitter thread from the Economist\u2019s John Peet. It starts here. Johnson insisted he would get a trade deal with the EU by the end of next year, but refused to say he was giving a \u201ccast-iron guarantee\u201d to that effect. Asked if he would \u201cabsolutely promise\u201d to get a trade deal with the EU by the end of the transition period, Johnson said he thought he could. We already have a deal. And we can come out on January 31 in a state of perfect equilibrium and grace with the rest of the EU because we have a zero-tariff, zero-quota position now, and I\u2019ve absolutely no doubt at all that we\u2019ll be able to make sure that the EU protects its own interests and has a deal with us that ensures that continues for the future. If you say, \u2018can I absolutely guarantee that we\u2019ll get a deal\u2019, I think I can and I\u2019ll tell you why \u2013 look at what we achieved ... in three months with the new deal that I did. We did it and it\u2019s a great deal and it will take this country forward and I\u2019m very proud of it. But when he was asked if that was a \u201ccast-iron guarantee\u201d, Johnson said: \u201cThe possibility you allude to simply will not happen.\u201d Johnson refused to commit to doing an interview with Andrew Neil for the BBC. Asked about this, he said: I\u2019m the first prime minister to have done two, or about to do two one-on-one leadership debates, several hours\u2019 worth of phone-ins, endless press conferences and interviews with all sorts of BBC people called Andrew. And I will continue to submit to the interrogation of the media. He also said that his communications director, Lee Cain, was the person to speak to for details of his media appearances, but the tone of his answer implied that he did not want, or expect, to do the Neil interview. Johnson defended plans in the Conservative manifesto to pass a law restricting strikes on public transport. He said: I do think it\u2019s absurd that critical transport mass-transit systems should be capable of being put out of actions by strikes, and other countries around the world have minimum service requirements for public transport - and that\u2019s what I want to see. He said people would be \u201coutraged\u201d if Labour were to allow EU nationals to vote in a second Brexit referendum. He said: I think the whole proposal from the Labour party is bizarre. I think people will be outraged by the whole thing and ... to think that it is going to be rigged in some way by getting in millions more voters who\u2019d be very likely to vote one way rather than another, I think that would cause a great deal of public disquiet and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the right way forward. Earlier I posted some Press Association copy about Boris Johnson taking a selfie with Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby after his appearance on ITV\u2019s This Morning. (See 1.56pm.) The Press Association has subsequently filed this addition. A Conservative spokesman subsequently denied the phone was the prime minister\u2019s. But on the show Willoughby said Johnson reappeared after his interview and \u201che whipped his phone out and he took a selfie\u201d to which Schofield replied: \u201cBut he didn\u2019t know he had to press the button \u2026\u201d The most awkward questions for Boris Johnson today came on the subject of tax. Overnight, the Conservatives briefed out a story about how they would hold a budget in February \u201cwhich will cut taxes for hard-working families\u201d and this morning the Daily Telegraph and the Times both splashed on stories about the Tories offering tax cuts. But the Tories have already published details of their tax plans, and they show that, although personal taxes would go down in their first budget, the overall tax burden would rise because they have cancelled a planned cut in corporation tax. (In budget terms, that counts as a tax rise.) Overall, the cuts and the increases for 2020-21 effectively balance out, but the tax increase total (\u00a33,320m) is bigger than the tax cut total (\u00a33,195m), making a net increase in the tax burden of \u00a35m. This is perfectly defensible. You can argue that the personal tax burden is not the same as the overall tax burden. You could also argue that a tax cut forgone is not the same as a tax rise (although economists will tell you that it is). But Johnson did not do either of these things. Instead, when asked about these figures, he claimed not to know what they were, and refused to accept that the overall tax burden would rise. The BBC\u2019s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, first raised this point. She put it to Johnson that he was saying he would cut taxes in February, when overall his manifesto said taxes would go up. Johnson did not accept this. He said: I don\u2019t know what you are talking about ... We\u2019re cutting taxes on business rates, we\u2019re cutting national insurance contributions for everybody in the country, everybody paying NICs. When Kuenssberg pushed him on this again, saying that overall taxes would go up, he claimed not to recognise the data. He told her: We\u2019re cutting taxes on national insurance contributions and on business rates, and I\u2019m certainly not aware of the data you describe. We\u2019re cutting taxes. And in our first budget we propose to do more to cut taxes. Later Liz Bates from Channel 4 News made the same point, and asked Johnson why he was not willing to admit that taxes would go up when it said so in black and white in his manifesto. He replied: Because it\u2019s absolutely not right. We have got a manifesto that commits us to cutting national insurance contributions for everybody in the country. Here is the chart from the Tory manifesto costing document (pdf) showing the party\u2019s proposed tax cuts. And here is the chart from the same documents showing the proposed tax increases. In an article with the Sun about his daily routine during the campaign Johnson joked that, when he needed to relax at night, he resorted to \u201ca few quadratic equations\u201d. But you don\u2019t need to be able to do quadratic equations to know that \u00a33,320m is more than \u00a33,195m. Q: What will you say to a voter next year who says, \u2018You said Brexit would be over, but I keep hearing about it on the news.\u2019 Johnson says he does not accept that will happen. Q: Why won\u2019t you admit that taxes will go up under your plans? Johnson says his priority in his first budget will be cutting taxes, not raising them. That\u2019s it. The Q&amp;A is over. I will post a summary soon. Q: If there were a second referendum next year, would it be right to give EU nationals the vote? Johnson says the Labour plan is bizarre. He says Jeremy Corbyn cannot find anyone in his shadow cabinet who would vote for the deal he will negotiate. And he says that trying to rig the referendum would be wrong. Q: Will you do an interview with Andrew Neil? Johnson says he would be \u201cvery happy do interviews with all manner of people\u201d. He says he has submitted himself to lots of interviews. He says he is the first PM to do two one-on-one debates. As for questions about the Neil interview, he says the questioner should ask his communications director, Lee Cain. Johnson refuses to commit to doing an interview with Andrew Neil. Q: We have not heard anything from Jacob Rees-Mogg during the campaign. Will he be in your cabinet? Johnson says questions like that come under the category of measuring up the curtains. He wants to focus on winning the election. Q: Do you want to ban strikes on public transport and the tube? Johnson says it is absurd that critical, mass transport systems can be put out of action by strikes. He wants to have minimum standards for them. That happens in other countries, he says. He says that idea is in the Tory manifesto. Q: Did the previous Tory governments cut too much? Johnson says he was running London at the time. He says the Tory government had a mess to sort out. He wants to invest. Q: So did it cut too much? Johnson says that is idle speculation. He says Labour would start with an economic crisis, not end with one. Q: Can you give a cast-iron guarantee that you will negotiate a trade deal with the EU by the end of next year? Johnson says the prospect of not having a deal won\u2019t arise, but he refuses to give a cast-iron guarantee. Q: You say today that you will present a budget in February that will cut tax. But overall your plans will raise tax. And you say you will get Brexit done. But the talks will still go on. How can people trust what you say? Johnson says he does not understand the first point. He is going to cut taxes, he says. And he says taking the UK out of the EU on 31 January will end the parliamentary wrangling. When pressed on the point about taxes, Johnson says he does not know what Laura Kuenssberg, who asked the question, was referring to. Johnson obviously missed these tweets from the Financial Times\u2019 economics editor, Chris Giles. Johnson gets presented with a scarf saying get Brexit done. Q: Can you guarantee that the NHS will not be vulnerable to other countries or outside bodies? Yes, says Johnson. He says his charge often comes up. But the NHS is a fantastic thing. He says he is building 40 new hospitals. They will be there in 10 years\u2019 time, as a result of the decisions he is taking. And he wants to have 50,000 more GP appointments. A healthier population will make for a happier, richer country, he says. Johnson is now taking questions, from workers first. He says he will take media questions later. A woman says she sent Johnson an email some time ago. She lives at the top of Matlock, where people want to build 400 homes on a flood plain. There have been floods there, she says. Why is this going ahead? Johnson says he has met a huge amount of people who suffered during the recent floods. \u201cWe have got to stop building on flood plains,\u201d she says. The government is investing in brownfield sites, he says. He says he will pass this on to Sarah Dines, the Tory candidate for Derbyshire Dales, so she can take this up with the planners. Q: When Brexit is over, are you going to pull the country back together? Yes, says Johnson. He says the wrangling in the country has got worse. But in the Conservative party people are coming together. If Brexit is delivered, people will come together, he says. He now tells an anecdote from his visit to the Red Bull Racing centre yesterday. He says he was told they had managed to reduce the engine size from 2.6 litres to something smaller. But the engines were more powerful. That leads him on to claiming that this parliament has been holding Britain back like a punctured tyre. Johnson is now doing his familiar riff about how remarkable exports are. But there is a new, or newish, joke. Britain is the only country to export music to the United States, he says. That\u2019s why they call it One Direction, he says. Boris Johnson says he is at the John Smedley factory. He says he has some John Smedley garments himself. He starts by explaining why he is having an election. Parliament is \u201cbroken down, jacknifed\u201d, he says. It is the standard stump speech ... Boris Johnson is holding a campaign event in Derbyshire. He is at a factory where he is due to take questions from workers. The former chancellor George Osborne and his former opposite number Ed Balls will reunite for ITV\u2019s election night coverage, the Press Association reports. Since leaving frontline politics Osborne is, among other things, now the editor of the London Evening Standard, while Balls transformed his public image as a contestant on Strictly Come Dancing in 2016. ITV has confirmed that the pair will join the former Scottish Conservatives leader Ruth Davidson, as well as the former Labour home secretary Alan Johnson. Andrew Neil has already recorded his interview with Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader. It will be shown on BBC One tonight. In a clip released in advance, Farage said the three MEPs who announced they were quitting today were all linked to the Tories. He said: One of them is a sister of a cabinet minister, another one has a boyfriend working for that cabinet minister \u2013 fact, and another one is a personal friend of Boris Johnson\u2019s. Farage was referring to Annunziata Rees-Mogg, Lucy Harris and Lance Forman respectively. Farage also claimed that Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal was unacceptable. He said: And I\u2019ll tell you something, Boris Johnson\u2019s deal unamended is unacceptable and I certainly stand by that. That is not what Farage implied when he announced last month that he would not be standing candidates in Tory-held seats. In its submission to the Equality and Human Rights Commission inquiry into antisemitism in the Labour party (see 7.35am and 9.20am) the Jewish Labour Movement claims Jeremy Corbyn has made the party \u201ca welcoming refuge for antisemites\u201d. Corbyn was asked about this claim on a campaign visit to Peterborough earlier. He rejected it firmly. Asked about the allegation, he replied: I completely reject that. When I became leader of the party there were no processes in place to deal with antisemitism. We introduced an appeals procedure to deal with it and we introduced an education process, so that party members understood the hurt that can be caused by antisemitic remarks or antisemitic behaviour. I think we\u2019ve got processes in place that have improved it a great deal. I\u2019ve posted it already, but I will post it again because it is the most arresting picture of the day, and you could write an entire treatise about celebrity culture, daytime TV and the impartiality of the media on the basis of its implications: Boris Johnson posing for a selfie with Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby after his appearance on their programme, ITV\u2019s This Morning. But there is another issue thrown up by the picture too; Johnson is using a Huawei phone. This is from the Press Association. Boris Johnson has appeared on television using a Huawei smartphone, despite ongoing security concerns around the Chinese company. Following an interview on ITV\u2019s This Morning, the prime minister used what appeared to be a Huawei P20 \u2013 understood to be his own \u2013 to take a selfie with presenters Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby. Willoughby said Johnson reappeared after his interview on the programme and \u201che whipped his phone out\u201d in order to take the picture. The incident comes in the midst of a heated debate around the company and allegations of its close links to the Chinese state - critics have argued that Huawei\u2019s telecoms equipment could be used to spy on people in the west - something the company has always denied. It insists it abides by the laws of each country in which it operates. The US, which has placed trade restrictions on the firm, has previously suggested that future co-operation with other members of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing partnership \u2013 the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand \u2013 could be jeopardised if the Chinese company was given a role in the UK\u2019s 5G infrastructure. On Wednesday, Johnson said he would not compromise Britain\u2019s national security over whether to give the telecoms firm a role in building the UK\u2019s 5G network. The Conservative party refused to comment on the incident. Boris Johnson is due to hold a campaign event shortly. But, as the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg reports, there\u2019s been a problem. The academic Simon Usherwood has an interesting Twitter thread on the Brexit party resignations. It starts here. And here are some of his posts. Q: What would you say to Nigel Farage if he were here? Forman says he would invite Farage to join them, and to stand down his candidates. Q: In all but about 20 seats? Forman suggests it would be better to stand down everywhere. Sometimes you have to swallow your pride, he says. He says Farage could be seen as a great statesman if he were to do that. And that\u2019s it. The press conference is over. Q: Do you feel Brexit party supporters are now lions led by donkeys? Longworth says he hates personal attacks. For him, this is all about Brexit. He says it is wrong that the Brexit party is now putting the party ahead of Brexit. Q: Do you think Nigel Farage\u2019s tactical decisions have jeopardised Brexit? Rees-Mogg says all four MEPs on the panel have raised concerns about Farage\u2019s strategy. She thinks he wants an independent UK. But she thinks he is going about it the wrong way, and risking the election of a remainer government. Q: The Brexit party response to your move has been vicious. (See 10.06am.) Have they always had their suspicions about the four of you? Longworth says he does not think so. He says the problem only started when Nigel Farage decided the party would oppose Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal. It would have been better to work with Johnson on improving it, he says. He says he does not think a formal alliance with the Tories would have worked. But at this point he says he thinks, if you support Brexit, backing the Tories is the only option. Q: Will you stand down as MEPs? And will you work together as a group? Harris says they won\u2019t stand down. She says they want to be in the European parliament to vote for Boris Johnson\u2019s deal. The Brexit party will vote against it, she says. Q: [To Longworth] Did the Brexit party strip you of the whip yesterday because they knew you were going to do this? Longworth says he does not know. He says the Brexit party refused to tell him directly why the whip was being withdrawn. But he says he was in Brussels yesterday for an internal committee vote. He said he was not allowed to tell the Brexit party about what happened, and he thinks that may have been why he was disciplined. Q: You said you have not discussed this with the Tories. But have the Tories discussed this with you in the past? Longworth says he has never had any approach from the Conservative party. He says Nigel Farage keeps alleging this, but it is not true. Annunziata Rees-Mogg says she has had no offers from the Conservative party at all. She says she gets annoyed when people suggest she is acting on behalf of her brother. She isn\u2019t. I have had no approaches from the Conservative party in any description and I am, frankly, finding it really quite disturbingly old-fashioned that people are suggesting that my brother gets to tell me what to do with my political views \u2013 he doesn\u2019t. We have completely independent views from each other and I am only concerned about Brexit. I haven\u2019t spoken to anyone about it - they wouldn\u2019t be able to bribe me. This is purely, purely about Brexit. Harris and Lance Forman both say they have never had offers from the Tories either. The panel are now taking questions. Q: Have any of you been offered jobs or honours by the Tories? John Longworth says they have not even discussed this move with the Tories. Q: Are you planning to join the Conservatives? Lucy Harris says this is what they are saying for the moment. But, if invited to campaign for a Conservative candidate, she would. Annunziata Rees-Mogg MEP is speaking now. (This is one Rees-Mogg that CCHQ will be happy to see on the news. Her brother, Jacob, the leader of the Commons, has been invisible during the campaign since he suggested that the Grenfell Tower residents lacked the common sense to ignore the advice to stay put.) Rees-Mogg says she joined the Brexit party earlier this year, when it looked as if Theresa May was going to deny the country a proper Brexit. But the party\u2019s success ensured a Brexiter became Tory leader. When Boris Johnson unveiled his Brexit plan, the Brexit party immediately decided it was unacceptable. Rees-Mogg says that was a mistake. And she says the fact that the party is standing now in Tory target seats means it could split the Brexit vote, and let in Labour candidates. The Brexit party are now \u201cthe very party risking Brexit\u201d, she claims. John Longworth MEP is speaking at the press conference now. He says he was always a Eurosceptic. He recalls sitting on a government taskforce on deregulation when Margaret Thatcher was PM, and realising how resistant some government departments were to deregulation. He says he publicly came out in favour of Brexit during the referendum campaign. At the time he was the director general of the British Chambers of Commerce. He says he was infuriated by the scaremongering coming from the remain campaign about the consequences of Brexit. He says he joined the Brexit party to ensure Brexit happened. He says if the Brexit party had not been formed, and won seats in the European elections, Theresa May and Philip Hammond would have pushed through a watered-down version of Brexit. He says, since then, the Brexit party has morphed into something else. It has non-Brexit goals. But Longworth says he is only interested in Brexit. He says Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal has \u201cthe potential to be a great deal\u201d. I would say it equates to being a little bit better than the Norway deal - but it has the potential to be a great deal. It is also \u201cthe only game in town\u201d, he says. All the alternatives would lead to article 50 being revoked. That is why he thinks people should vote Conservative in the election, even if they have to \u201chold their nose\u201d. Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London, was on LBC this morning. As LBC\u2019s Theo Usherwood reports, Khan said that Boris Johnson\u2019s record on racism was far worse than Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s on antisemitism - not least because Johnson has been paid for what he had said in his journalism. Lance Forman, the London MEP, is speaking at the press conference. He says, if it is acceptable for the Brexit party to stand down in 317 Tory-held seats, it makes sense for the Brexit party to back the Conservative party everywhere. He says his decision is not prompted by opposition to Nigel Farage. He pays tribute to Farage, saying he has achieved a huge amount. He also says he is worried about antisemitism in the Labour party. The four Brexit party MEPs who have left to back the Conservatives are now holding a press conference in Westminster. There is a live feed here. And this is from the Brexit party MEP Michael Heaver. These are from the Brexit party MEP Alexandra Phillips on the four defectors. Here is the video message from the Brexit party\u2019s \u201cgang of four\u201d explaining why they are now backing the Conservatives. This is from Lucy Harris, one of the four Brexit party MEPs who has left the party to support the Conservatives. One measure of the dismal state of our politics is the way political interviewing at this election seems to consist mostly of demanding apologies. With Jeremy Corbyn, it\u2019s for antisemitism. With Jo Swinson, it\u2019s for her record in coalition. And with Boris Johnson - well, there is quite a choice, but racist, homophobic or otherwise offensive comments made by him in newspaper columns tend to come at the top of the list. (Note to younger readers: election campaigns didn\u2019t always used to be like this.) Johnson was on ITV\u2019s This Morning a few minutes ago. Two days ago the presenter Phillip Schofield managed to get an apology out of Corbyn. Today he managed the same with Johnson. Here are the main points. Johnson apologised for describing women wearing burqas as looking like letterboxes. Unlike many of the other comments in previous newspaper articles for which he is being criticised, Johnson wrote this relatively recently, in the summer last year. Asked whether he would say sorry for the offence caused, he replied: I have already said sorry for any offence that I\u2019ve caused, and I say it again. Johnson has not always been willing to apologise for these comments. When Fiona Bruce asked him to apologise for these comments in the BBC Question Time leaders\u2019 special two weeks ago, he refused. But on Friday last week, in a phone-in on LBC, Johnson did issued a generalised apology. Asked about Islamophobia in the Conservative party, he said: I apologise ... Many people who will point out I have said things that have caused offence. Well, I\u2019m deeply sorry for the offence that I caused. Johnson said claims that the NHS would be on the table in trade talks with the US was as implausible as stories about UFOs. When it was put to him that there was a dossier showing the NHS had been discussed in talks, he replied: And there are photographs that purport to prove there are UFOs. But it is complete nonsense. Asked to give a \u201crock-solid guarantee\u201d that no part of the NHS would be sold off, Johnson said he could, repeating the words \u201crock-solid guarantee\u201d. Johnson said he could promise that Brexit would happen on 31 January if he won a majority. On ITV\u2019s This Morning Holly Willoughby asks about crime and safety. A lot of people feel unsafe, she says. Boris Johnson says he massively reduced crime when he was mayor of London. He says that Usman Khan, the London Bridge attacker, had to be released. It is always worth trying to rehabilitate people, he says. But there are some people incapable of changing, and Khan was probably one of them, he says. Q: Does it help for a PM to use terms like bank robber and letterbox to describe women who wear the burqa? Johnson says he has already said sorry for any offence caused, and he says it again. Johnson apologises for any offence caused by his article comparing women wearing burqas to letterboxes. He says it is worth looking at what the article using those words said. He is proud of his Muslim ancestry, he says. He says he will have an inquiry into prejudice and xenophobia of all kinds. Q: You also branded single mothers as irresponsible, and working-class men as feckless, in an article in 1995? Johnson says this is not the time to talk about any offence given by an article written a long time ago. Boris Johnson is giving an interview to ITV\u2019s This Morning. He says he loves the NHS. He can give an absolute guarantee that no part of the NHS will be sold off, he says. Phillip Schofield puts it to him that companies part-owned by Americans already play a big role in providing NHS services. Johnson says this was a process that happened under Labour, when contracts were outsourced. According to the Press Association, the other two Brexit MEPs who are resigning are Lance Forman and Lucy Harris. Forman is an MEP for London and runs a smoked salmon business. And Harris is an MEP for Yorkshire and the Humber, and an opera singer. And Press Association also quotes the MEP Annunziata Rees-Mogg explaining her decision to leave the Brexit party. She said: We need a strong leave-supporting government to deliver the Brexit 17.4m voted for. The Conservatives are the only option for Brexit supporters and democrats alike. The defection of four Brexit party MEPs (see 9.47am) still has not been formally announced, but the Brexit party itself has issued a response. It says three of its MEPs are resigning the whip. It says John Longworth already had the whip removed yesterday. In a statement Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, said: Whilst we are disappointed that four of our MEPs don\u2019t seem to understand that we both saved the Conservative party from large-scale losses to the Liberal Democrats in the south and south-west of England but we are also hammering the Labour leave vote in its traditional heartlands, making it much easier for the Conservatives to win many of those seats. The only vote on the leave side that is currently being split is in areas such as Barnsley, the South Wales Valleys, Doncaster and Hartlepool, where there is a risk that the Tories will split our vote. As proof of his claim that the Brexit party will make it easier for the Tories to win Labour seats in leave-voting areas, Farage cited the Survation poll for the Economist two weeks ago, which shows the Tories on course to win the previously safe Labour seat of Great Grimsby ostensibly because the Labour vote has collapsed by 18 points, which is almost exactly what the Brexit party is polling in the constituency. In the statement, a Brexit party spokesman added: We also note that one of the MEPs is the sister of a cabinet minister, another has a partner who works in the office of the same cabinet minister and yet another is a personal friend of both Boris Johnson and Michael Gove. In the case of John Longworth, who was for years the firmest advocate of WTO withdrawal that we have ever met, he underwent a metamorphosis into being a supporter of the new EU treaty following two days of meetings in London. We hope that Mr Longworth is well rewarded for his actions. That means Annunziata Rees-Mogg is expected to defect; her brother Jacob is the leader of the Commons. According to a report by David Wooding for the Sun, four Brexit party MEPs will today announce that they are quitting their party and urging people to vote Conservative instead. One of them is John Longworth, the former director general of the British Chambers of Commerce and former Leave Means Leave chairman who yesterday had the whip removed because he had publicly criticised the election strategy being pursued by Nigel Farage, the party leader. In his report, which Brexit party sources are not denying, Wooding says Longworth and his colleagues fear that the Farage strategy could be putting Brexit at risk. He writes: Mr Longworth was unavailable for comment last night but an insider said: \u2018We can\u2019t support a party that jeopardises Brexit. \u2018Too many people are concerned about their own egos rather than the cause we have all been campaigning for: to leave the EU. \u2018It has become increasingly clear that unless the Tories win next week, Brexit is doomed. But some of our team are so wrapped up in their own self-interest they can\u2019t see that.\u2019 Wooding says the split follows weeks of infighting among the Brexit party\u2019s MEPs. The walkout follows weeks of vicious infighting among the Brexit party group in the European parliament. It was described by one as \u2018a toxic battle between the old Ukippers and the old Tories\u2019. Tempers became even more frayed in October when the party hierarchy decided to oppose Boris Johnson\u2019s deal \u2013 within minutes of it being announced. The Brexit party, which was only properly launched this year, won 29 seats in the European election, making it the biggest single party represented in the European parliament. It triumphed because Theresa May\u2019s failure to pass a Brexit deal, and her decision to accept a Brexit extension, made it hard for Brexiters to vote for the Tories. But at this election the Brexit vote has swung back to the Conservatives, a process that has been encourage by Farage effectively endorsing Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal and refusing to stand candidates in Tory-held seats. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Matthew Weaver. Here is a link to the Jewish Labour Movement submission to the Equality and Human Rights Commission inquiry into antisemitism in the Labour party mentioned earlier. (See 7.35am.) A member of the Scottish National party\u2019s conduct committee, who was due to rule on antisemitism allegations against its former candidate in Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath, has herself resigned from the party after being challenged over alleged antisemitism. Denise Findlay, an SNP activist who tweets as @GraceBrodie, said she had resigned yesterday after SNP officials confronted her over her stance on Israel, shortly before a Channel 4 News report on her tweets. In a tweet saying she had resigned, she said: \u201cThere are tweets where I\u2019m arguing that Israel=Nazi should not be part of the definition of anti-semitism.\u201d That tweet no longer appears in her timeline but she later confirmed on Twitter that was the topic. Findlay was a prominent supporter of Neale Hanvey, a former leader of the SNP group on Fife council who was sacked as the party\u2019s candidate for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath late last month after two allegedly antisemitic posts came to light. Hanvey\u2019s membership was also suspended; Findlay had been elected to join the conduct committee which would rule on his membership in October. Hanvey is still contesting the seat, running as an independent, with many local members ignoring Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s demand that they campaign for the SNP in other seats. Findlay has been backing his decision to continue campaigning, and donated to his election crowdfunding appeal. The controversy, which has divided the party in Fife, increases the chances of Labour retaining the seat. It is being defended by Lesley Laird, a Corbyn ally who is Labour\u2019s shadow Scottish secretary. Labour is averaging 18% in the polls in Scotland and, until this split, Hanvey was widely tipped to win the seat. In a statement on Wednesday night, the SNP said: There is no place for antisemitism in Scotland or in the SNP. All political parties have a duty to show leadership, and we will always take tough action in order to reassure the Jewish community that these matters are taken seriously. When challenged on her actions, Denise Findlay resigned from the SNP. The views she expressed are entirely at odds with the ethos of this party. Findlay apologised in a statement to the Courier newspaper in Dundee: When I tweeted about Israel and compared them to Nazis, I did not know that was antisemitic. I am profusely sorry and I now fully understand that what I said was hurtful to the Jewish community. I still believe you should be able to criticise the Israeli government for their actions in Palestine. I am not a politician and was not aware of the IHRA definition. I do know now and realise I made a mistake. I am really sorry. Here\u2019s some reaction to Javid\u2019s remarks on the prospects of a free trade deal by the end of next year. The chancellor has also refused to rule out a no-deal Brexit at the end of next year. Javid was repeatedly asked on the Today programme whether there was a chance of the UK leaving the EU with no deal at the end of 2020. He said the chances of the that were \u201cextremely remote\u201d but dodged several opportunities to rule it out. He claimed that outline of a free trade agreement had already been worked out. He said: By the end of 2020, we will have agreed and finalised the trade deal, a very ambitious, deep, comprehensive free trade agreement. And we will get that done also by the end of 2020. In the time that we\u2019ve been negotiating over the last 100 days or so, it wasn\u2019t just the exit agreement ... we are also negotiated and worked and agreed the outline of the ambitious free trade agreement. There is no a single doubt in my mind that it can be agreed within months, and we can get it through parliament by 2020. Asked what tariffs the car industry would pay under such a deal, Javid said: Because it\u2019s a deep, comprehensive free trade agreement, it\u2019s zero tariffs, zero quotas, not just for the car industry, an agreement on services, having equivalents on financial services. We\u2019ve set all this out. The chancellor, Sajid Javid, claims that Boris Johnson could still do that interview with the BBC\u2019s Andrew Neil. Speaking in a round of broadcast interviews on his 50th birthday, Javid told Sky News that \u201cnegotiations are still ongoing\u201d. Neil\u2019s head-to-head with Jeremy Corbyn created days of negative headlines for Labour over antisemitism and funding for Labour\u2019s spending plans. Corbyn\u2019s team are furious that Johnson appears to be trying to avoid being put under similar scrutiny, insisting they were assured the prime minister had signed up for a similar interview before agreeing to put up their candidate. A lawyer representing the Jewish Labour Movement has accused Labour of not fully investigating all cases of antisemitism within the party. Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, James Libson, a partner at the Mishcon de Reya law firm, said he had prepared 70 sworn testimonies from Labour party staffers past and present as part of evidence submitted to the Equality and Human Rights Commission\u2019s investigation into allegations of antisemitism in the party. Libson, when asked whether the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s assertion that every case of antisemitism had been dealt with was incorrect, said: \u201cVery much so.\u201d He added: There are many, many outstanding complaints, many examples of interference and many examples of double-standards in the way in which complaints are processed. Asked whether there was evidence that the Labour leader\u2019s office was \u201cinterfering\u201d in the investigations process, Libson said: There has been interference and that interference has unfortunately become institutional. Institutional in the sense that people affiliated with the leader\u2019s office \u2013 and now in the actual unit that are investigating \u2013 and that at a more basic level, information is passing between the leader\u2019s office and investigating unit. He added: \u201cPassed by USB sticks, by WhatsApp groups, secret WhatsApp groups.\u201d The shadow housing secretary, John Healey, said Labour had \u201ctoughened up\u201d its approach to tackling antisemitism. He told Today: Having been too slow and too weak at the start, the action being taken now has been toughened up. An in-house lawyer, special appeal panels to deal with complaints, new fast-track expulsion powers that are being used. I\u2019m confident that cases coming in are being dealt with and if they are coming in they will be dealt with.\u201d Healey apologised to the Jewish community who he said \u201cfeel let down\u201d by the way Labour has handled cases of antisemitism in the party. The shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, has tried to get Jeremy Corbyn out of a hole with royalists, by suggesting he may watch the Queen\u2019s speech on catchup. Corbyn appeared to be caught out by ITV\u2019s Julie Etchingham when asked whether he watched the Queen\u2019s Christmas broadcast. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s on in the morning, usually we have it on some of the time.\u201d The speech is broadcast at 3pm. Challenged about the apparent gaffe, which made the front page of the Daily Express (see below), Rayner told ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain: \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean to say he watches it on Christmas Day. He said he watched it in the morning. He said he also visits a homeless shelter.\u201d Asked whether Corbyn meant he watched the speech on Boxing Day, Rayner said: I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not with Jeremy Corbyn on Christmas Day. What I\u2019m saying is from my own experience sometimes I watch programmes on catchup, sometimes on the time it\u2019s at. Most kids, including my kids, watch [programmes] on YouTube. So it can be confusing about which times people watch something. You don\u2019t have to watch it at the time that is specified in the TV guide. Asked whether she would be watching the Queen\u2019s speech, Rayner said: \u201cI always do. My kids are named after kings and so I\u2019ve got James and Charles.\u201d What the papers said Joe Biden\u2019s team clearly loved the footage that appeared to show world leaders laughing at Trump. The day ahead Boris Johnson will head to the Midlands, where he will have a tour of a mill shop and inspect some knitwear. Jeremy Corbyn will also be in the Midlands, where he will visit several schools before hosting a rally in the evening. The Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, will visit a care home in Edinburgh before appearing at a rally alongside colleagues from the Scottish section of the party. It\u2019s Nigel Farage\u2019s turn to face off against Andrew Neil. The interview will be broadcast at 7.30pm. Good morning everyone, it\u2019s a week until election day. After the brief but amusing distraction that was Nato, all attention is back on to the vote and Boris Johnson will resume campaigning today. Johnson survived the summit relatively unscathed. There had been concerns in the Conservative camp that Johnson\u2019s proximity to the US president might be damaging, stoking voter fears that the NHS might be on the table in US-UK trade deals. But the prime minister managed to avoid almost any public meetings with Trump, though he was caught on camera apparently joking about Trump with other world leaders, something Johnson astonishingly has no memory of. After the video of the interaction did the rounds, Trump called Justin Trudeau \u201ctwo-faced\u201d and then announced he was leaving early and would not be giving a press conference. Don\u2019t miss Marina Hyde\u2019s or John Crace\u2019s take on yesterday\u2019s events. Now that all the Nato shenanigans are out of the way, normal programming can resume. Johnson has launched his plans for the first 100 days after he takes office if he wins on 12 December. He says his main focus would be passing the withdrawal agreement to ensure Brexit happens on 31 January. Other priorities include bringing in legislation to end the automatic release of serious violent and sexual offenders at the halfway point of their sentence \u2013 which the family of murdered student Jack Merritt have condemned as a kneejerk politicisation of the London Bridge terror attack \u2013 and increasing the amount that new immigrants pay to use the NHS. Labour will be talking about education today as Jeremy Corbyn visits schools, and the shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, will pledge to recruit 20,000 more teachers, cap secondary class sizes at 30, and spend \u00a37bn on repairs and upgrades to England\u2019s crumbling school buildings. They will also promise free, healthy breakfasts for all primary-age children as part of a multibillion pound plan to \u201cpoverty-proof\u201d England\u2019s schools. OK, thanks for reading along, we\u2019ll be with you all day, so keep hitting that refresh button.",

Three of the four professors thought it absolutely did. \u201cThey said what [Trump] did was exactly what the founders had in mind when they outlined impeachment in the constitution,\u201d Kimmel explained. \u201cBasically, they rolled up the constitution and spanked him with it. \u201cIt all boils down to this: Donald Trump used the office of president for his own personal gain, which must confuse him because he\u2019s like yeah, of course I did \u2014 that\u2019s why I ran for president,\u201d Kimmel continued. Which led Kimmel to his dream Christmas gift for the year 2019: \u201cI\u2019d love to see what these Republicans would say if President Obama had done this,\u201d he said. \u201cImagine if Obama had frozen millions of dollars of military aid to one of our allies who was at war in exchange for dirt on Mitt Romney. They\u2019d be losing their minds.\u201d",

Respect!\u201d</p> <p>Sadly, Trump never became the second half of his own tweet, no matter what he sees in the mirror each morning.</p> <p>Instead he became the kind of leader who bragged to the United Nations how awesome his administration was. To be specific, he told last year\u2019s general assembly that it was more awesome than \u201calmost any other administration in the history of our country\u201d. At which point, the massed ranks of world leaders started guffawing.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect that reaction, but that\u2019s OK,\u201d he <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/at-united-nations-trump-rejects-constraints-imposed-by-other-nations-says-us-will-act-to-counter-global-control/2018/09/25/1a5f8b22-c0c9-11e8-be77-516336a26305_story.html\">said</a>.</p> <p>It\u2019s never OK for this fragile snowflake of a tough guy. When asked about Trudeau\u2019s laughter on Wednesday, Trump melted once again.</p> <p>\u201cWell he\u2019s two-faced,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd honestly with Trudeau, he\u2019s a nice guy. I find him to be a very nice guy. But you know the truth is that I called him out on the fact that he\u2019s not paying 2%. And I guess he\u2019s not very happy about it.\u201d</p> <p>Yeah, that must be it. Totally nailed him on that one.</p> <p>Sitting beside him, Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, was surely impressed with the savage indictment of the size of Canada\u2019s military spending. But she subtly masked her admiration by looking like an anxious patient expecting a bad prognosis.</p> <p>There was plenty to feel queasy about. Trump once again heaped praise on himself for carving up the Kurds, in alliance with the Russians, Syrians and Turks. \u201cMaybe someday they\u2019ll give me credit, but probably not,\u201d he whined. \u201cBut that worked out well. They\u2019ve been trying to do this for a hundred years. That border is a mess for a long time.\u201d</p> <p>It worked out less well for America\u2019s Kurdish allies, but hey.</p> <p>Perhaps someday they\u2019ll also give him credit for his Greenland gambit, which he suggested would be part of his forthcoming talks with the Danish prime minister.</p> <p>\u201cDo you still want to buy Greenland,\u201d asked one cheeky reporter.</p> <p>\u201cShe must be in the real estate business,\u201d said the non-laughingstock president. \u201cThat\u2019s a very good question.\u201d</p> <p>After all those good questions about his genius at strategy and winning, Trump wimped out of his final press conference. \u201cI think we\u2019ve done plenty of press conferences,\u201d he said. \u201cUnless you\u2019re demanding a press conference, we\u2019ll do one, but I think we\u2019ve answered plenty of questions.\u201d</p> <p>For a split second, Boris Johnson gulped hard at the thought of one more chance for Trump to blow the British general election.</p> <p>And so the naked emperor declared he would get dressed, unless you thought he was already wearing something fancy, in which case he\u2019d stay happily inside his birthday suit.

Instead he became the kind of leader who bragged to the United Nations how awesome his administration was. To be specific, he told last year\u2019s general assembly that it was more awesome than \u201calmost any other administration in the history of our country\u201d. At which point, the massed ranks of world leaders started guffawing. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect that reaction, but that\u2019s OK,\u201d he said. It\u2019s never OK for this fragile snowflake of a tough guy. When asked about Trudeau\u2019s laughter on Wednesday, Trump melted once again. \u201cWell he\u2019s two-faced,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd honestly with Trudeau, he\u2019s a nice guy. I find him to be a very nice guy. But you know the truth is that I called him out on the fact that he\u2019s not paying 2%. And I guess he\u2019s not very happy about it.\u201d Yeah, that must be it. Totally nailed him on that one. Sitting beside him, Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, was surely impressed with the savage indictment of the size of Canada\u2019s military spending. But she subtly masked her admiration by looking like an anxious patient expecting a bad prognosis. There was plenty to feel queasy about. Trump once again heaped praise on himself for carving up the Kurds, in alliance with the Russians, Syrians and Turks. \u201cMaybe someday they\u2019ll give me credit, but probably not,\u201d he whined. \u201cBut that worked out well. They\u2019ve been trying to do this for a hundred years. That border is a mess for a long time.\u201d It worked out less well for America\u2019s Kurdish allies, but hey. Perhaps someday they\u2019ll also give him credit for his Greenland gambit, which he suggested would be part of his forthcoming talks with the Danish prime minister. \u201cDo you still want to buy Greenland,\u201d asked one cheeky reporter. \u201cShe must be in the real estate business,\u201d said the non-laughingstock president. \u201cThat\u2019s a very good question.\u201d After all those good questions about his genius at strategy and winning, Trump wimped out of his final press conference. \u201cI think we\u2019ve done plenty of press conferences,\u201d he said. \u201cUnless you\u2019re demanding a press conference, we\u2019ll do one, but I think we\u2019ve answered plenty of questions.\u201d For a split second, Boris Johnson gulped hard at the thought of one more chance for Trump to blow the British general election. And so the naked emperor declared he would get dressed, unless you thought he was already wearing something fancy, in which case he\u2019d stay happily inside his birthday suit. Respect!

For the past two years the Israel-based group has co-opted at least 21 organically grown far-right pages, using them to churn out thousands of coordinated posts to more than 1 million followers across four continents and funnelling audiences to a cluster of 10 advertisement-heavy websites to milk the traffic for profit. The posts stoke deep hatred of Islam across the western world and influence politics in Australia, Canada, the UK and the US by amplifying far-right parties including Australia\u2019s One Nation and vilifying Muslim politicians such as US Democratic congresswoman Ilhan Omar. The network has also targeted leftwing politicians at critical points in national election campaigns, posting false stories about the UK Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau.

So I figured, \u2018What the heck, give it a shot\u2019.\u201d</p> \n<p>Villereal and Devito weren\u2019t the only ones. Over the past two years, a group of mysterious Israel-based accounts has delivered similar messages to the heads of at least 19 other far-right Facebook pages across the US, Australia, the UK, Canada, Austria, Israel and Nigeria.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"def7b078-b0ad-4920-8a76-e91629afae57\" data-atom-type=\"audio\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Audio\"></div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/dec/05/monetising-hate-covert-enterprise-co-opts-far-right-facebook-pages-to-churn-out-anti-islamic-posts\">A Guardian investigation</a> can reveal those messages were part of a covert plot to control some of Facebook\u2019s largest far-right pages, including one linked to a rightwing terror group, and create a commercial enterprise that harvests Islamophobic hate for profit.</p> \n<p>This group is now using its 21-page network to churn out more than 1,000 coordinated faked news posts per week to more than 1 million followers, funnelling audiences to a cluster of 10 ad-heavy websites and milking the traffic for profit.</p> \n<p>The posts stoke deep hatred of Islam across the western world and influence politics in Australia, Canada, the UK and the US by amplifying far-right parties such as Australia\u2019s One Nation and vilifying Muslim politicians such as the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, and the US congresswoman Ilhan Omar.</p> \n<p>The network has also targeted leftwing politicians at critical points in national election campaigns.

Australia\u2019s first female Muslim senator, Mehreen Faruqi, felt the full force of the network in August last year, when 10 of its pages launched coordinated posts inciting their 546,000 followers to attack her for speaking in parliament against racism.</p> \n<p>The posts prompted what Faruqi described as a \u201chorrific feeding frenzy of racism, fake news and hate\u201d, soliciting vile comments like \u201cput your burka on \u2013 and shut the fuck up!\u201d, \u201cdeport the whining bitch\u201d and \u201cRevoke citizenship and Deport\u201d.</p> \n<p>Faruqi said the network represented a \u201cnew level of far-right organisation and coordination\u201d, and she places the blame squarely on social media companies.</p> \n<p>\u201cBy allowing racist and misleading posts, social media giants like Facebook \u2026 are profiteering from the proliferation of hate speech and abuse,\u201d Faruqi said.</p> \n<p>\u201cFacebook could do much more and shut these pages down but so long as they continue to profit from the reach and engagement, they don\u2019t seem to be interested in decisive action.\u201d</p> \n<p>A spokesperson for Facebook told the Guardian: \u201cNobody can advocate or advertise hate or violence on Facebook and we remove any violations as soon as we become aware.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframeable/2019/01/reusable-horizontal-bar-chart-v3/html/index.html?key=1rCtpSgYoACR5ENB6yPNg2lCetuhmIsEc8ZU_DFlUz0s\" data-alt=\"Chart: total interactions on coordinated posts by far-right Facebook pages\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframeable/2019/01/reusable-horizontal-bar-chart-v3/html/index.html?key=1rCtpSgYoACR5ENB6yPNg2lCetuhmIsEc8ZU_DFlUz0s\">Chart: total interactions on coordinated posts by far-right Facebook pages</a> \n</figure> \n<h2>\u2018The perfect foot soldiers\u2019</h2> \n<p>It begins with a single post, curated by Israel-based administrators.</p> \n<p>The post typically has an attention-grabbing headline and links to an article that mimics the style of a legitimate news story.</p> \n<p>It employs a blend of distorted news and total fabrication to paint Muslims as sharia-imposing terrorists and child abusers, whose existence poses a threat to white culture and western civilisation.</p> \n<p>It is then published almost simultaneously to the network\u2019s 21 Facebook pages, which have a combined 1 million followers across the globe.</p> \n<p>The content is so predictable that even Devito once complained to his Israeli counterpart. \u201cI told her flat out, \u2018you\u2019re a one-trick pony\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s Islam, Islam, Islam, Islam and more Islam.

The content is amplified further by other far-right Facebook pages, including those run by the rightwing UK Independence party (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ukip\">Ukip</a>), who share it organically.</p> \n<p>The posts link back to one of 10 near-identical websites masquerading as news sites with generic titles like \u201cThe Politics Online\u201d and \u201cFree Press Front\u201d. Ad-heavy and poorly designed, the websites feature \u201cstories\u201d that usually combine slabs of copied text intermingled with unsourced opinion and graphic imagery.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2019/03/contact-box\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The Guardian worked with researchers from Queensland University of Technology\u2019s digital media research centre, who conducted an analysis of the order in which identical posts appeared across the 21 Facebook pages.</p> \n<p>Their analysis indicates a single entity is coordinating the publication of content across the Facebook pages, likely using automatic scheduling software, and that a single entity controls the websites that receive traffic from the posts.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s very obvious looking at the websites, the way that they\u2019re structured, the way that they\u2019re sharing design and code, and the way they share Google site IDs, that they\u2019re all interconnected with each other,\u201d said QUT professor Axel Bruns, one of Australia\u2019s leading internet researchers. \u201cThey\u2019re just cheap sites to set up, cheap sites to run \u2026 It\u2019s not very sophisticated and it\u2019s just brute force, to push all this stuff out.\u201d</p> \n<p>Bruns and his colleagues believe the motivation is commercial, and that hatred, division and political influence may be byproducts of the pursuit of profit.</p> \n<p>\u201cHere\u2019s a bunch of people who \u2013 they\u2019re not stupid but they\u2019re highly prone to clicking on content that reflects their already held beliefs, especially content that is highly emotive and contains polarising and extreme material,\u201d said Timothy Graham, a senior lecturer on social network analysis at QUT.</p> \n<p>\u201cThese people are great for business. If you get them to come to your website, they\u2019re not going to [look closely at] the content, they\u2019re going to click through and keep [sharing] it.

A previous BuzzFeed News investigation into Never Again Canada showed it was regularly <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/never-again-canada-jdl-facebook\">sharing content about the Jewish Defence League, an FBI-designated rightwing terror group</a>, and coordinating content with other pages.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--showcase\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframeable/2019/01/reusable-stacked-bar-chart-v4/html/index.html?key=1UdZRhEhU38d7oEgF_PWeqbMJVt6_FJjNxehUAQXKJLQ\" data-alt=\"Coordinated content posting by far-right Facebook pages, by target country\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframeable/2019/01/reusable-stacked-bar-chart-v4/html/index.html?key=1UdZRhEhU38d7oEgF_PWeqbMJVt6_FJjNxehUAQXKJLQ\">Coordinated content posting by far-right Facebook pages, by target country</a> \n</figure> \n<p>The network reached its peak in October this year with coordination across 21 pages. Each time a local page-owner agrees to let one of the Israeli administrators in, they become unwitting though not necessarily unwilling participants in the globally coordinated distribution of online hate.</p> \n<p>Some page-owners, like Villereal, who runs Pissed off Deplorables, had no idea their new Israeli counterparts were making money from the following they had built.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little disheartening to sit here and think I\u2019ve been doing this for two years and I haven\u2019t made a dime, and I allowed someone to come in who\u2019s built the little back channel but they\u2019re going to use my clientele to make money,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s like I own the store, I built it and everything like that, and you\u2019re the one profiting.\u201d</p> \n<p>Those behind the network went to great lengths to hide their identities, concealing personal information from websites and using different Facebook profiles when contacting the owners of existing far-right pages.</p> \n<p>But by following a trail of digital breadcrumbs, the Guardian\u2019s investigation traced the network back to a key player: a man going by the username Ariel1238a.</p> \n<h2>Finding Ariel</h2> \n<p>In December 2017, Ariel1238a made a seemingly benign request for help on an obscure search engine optimisation forum.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for more ways to monetize my site,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMy niche is about politics.\u201d</p> \n<p>For the past two years, the same username has popped up regularly on similar web forums.</p> \n<p>Writing in broken English, Ariel1238a frets about drops in his click-through rate, the inability to host \u201cviolent content\u201d alongside advertising sourced through Google AdSense, and the low revenue return per-click on native advertising site Taboola. \u201cI\u2019m not satisfied with the profits they bring,\u201d he told one forum.</p> \n<p>He also complains about Facebook\u2019s efforts to crack down on \u201cfake news\u201d. When the social media giant announced in April that it would step up its efforts to combat misinformation on the site, Ariel wrote: \u201cFacebook has released another step on the way to its end, matter of time.\u201d</p> \n<p>Ariel1238a is not a web expert. He asks rudimentary questions including how to set up a business email domain and increase traffic to his sites. Yet his websites, he tells the forums, serve \u201cleading countries\u201d including the UK, US, Australia and Canada and have, he boasts, \u201csomthing like 1m pageviews per month\u201d.</p> \n<p>The posts give no suggestion that Ariel1238a will become a driving force behind a wave of anti-Islamic hate across Facebook.</p> \n<p>In fact, online profiles linked to Ariel1238a betray no political or ideological position at all. Instead, his digital footprint suggests that before he turned to exploiting the far-right\u2019s obsession with Islam for profit, he had for years engaged in a number of unsophisticated online money-making schemes.</p> \n<p>A now dormant account on a blog-publishing service links him to a \u201cfree sex dating\u201d site, a \u201creligious dating\u201d site and a fan page for the fourth season of the Israeli Big Brother television series. He has dabbled in online directories for gyms in Tel Aviv, Botox injections, an online sim card store and a site described simply as \u201cOnline sex | Camera sex\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Ariel1238a is not a web expert. He asks rudimentary questions including how to set up a business email domain and increase traffic to his sites.</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Using web archiving services and domain registry information, the Guardian has been able to confirm the username Ariel1238a belongs to Ariel Elkaras, a 30-something jewellery salesman and online operator living on the outskirts of Tel Aviv.</p> \n<p>Soon after the Guardian contacted Elkaras for comment, several of the network\u2019s websites were either taken down or had large amounts of content removed. The public posts on his Facebook profile were also removed.</p> \n<p>Elkaras did not respond to multiple requests for comment via email and phone, but the Guardian was able to track him down.</p> \n<p>When we turned up at his apartment in a town near Tel Aviv in Israel, an older woman answered the door. She called out to Elkaras, who arrived wearing a T-shirt and sweatpants.</p> \n<p>Through a translator, Elkaras denied knowledge of or involvement in the network but said he had once been \u201cincluded in a group, something about Israel\u201d. He refused to answer questions about his job, other than to confirm he dealt with computers. \u201cYes, but it\u2019s not your business,\u201d he said. \u201c[The network] is nothing related to me.\u201d</p> \n<p>When the Guardian asked about the username Ariel1238a, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He closed the door, but shortly after followed a reporter out on to the street and demanded to know how the Guardian had found him.</p> \n<p>Elkaras was the only real person the Guardian was able to connect to the operation. We were unable to verify whether Rochale, Tehila, or the other names used by the Facebook profiles that contacted page administrators, were the names of real people.</p> \n<p>Messages obtained by the Guardian show Rochale telling a local page administrator she doesn\u2019t know how to make money online and that she doesn\u2019t know who runs the websites she sources her content from.</p> \n<p>\u201cI only share posts on your page because this topic is important to me,\u201d she wrote.</p> \n<p>While initially describing Tehila as \u201ca Pam Geller type\u201d, Devito later admitted he had never actually seen or spoken to her. Asked how he knew she was real, he said: \u201cWe don\u2019t, to be brutally honest.\u201d</p> \n<p>Of the page administrators who returned requests for comment from the Guardian, only one claimed to have physically seen Tehila via Skype but declined to provide evidence. Asked how he knew he was speaking to a woman, the administrator, who declined to reveal his identity, said: \u201cIt sure looked like one.\u201d</p> \n<p>None of the page administrators the Guardian spoke to for this story were aware that the Israeli group was making money from the scheme, or that their pages were part of a larger network.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey weren\u2019t upfront about it because as much as I saw in the message ... there was no talk about making money,\u201d a pro-Trump page administrator based in Nigeria told the Guardian.</p> \n<h2>Political influence and Facebook\u2019s failures</h2> \n<p>In April last year, Zuckerberg sat before an army of cameras and offered a mea culpa to the world.</p> \n<p>Facebook, still reeling from the Cambridge Analytica scandal, had failed its users, Zuckerberg said. The company had struggled to stop its platform being used for coordinated political interference and the spread of disinformation and hate.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s clear now that we didn\u2019t do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t take a broad enough view of our responsibility, and that was a big mistake. And it was my mistake.\u201d</p> \n<p>Two months later, the Israeli-based network gained access to its 13th far-right Facebook page, expanding the already sizeable audience for its disinformation.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"273a9a89900a8122cb209c1e4e442312f4b02848\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/273a9a89900a8122cb209c1e4e442312f4b02848/0_0_4844_3229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Facebook chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, testifies before the House of Representatives energy and commerce committee\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Facebook chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, testifies before the House of Representatives energy and commerce committee in April 2018.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The network has operated with relative impunity for almost two years.</p> \n<p>\u201cBelieve it or not she hasn\u2019t done anything to get the page in trouble,\u201d Devito said of his Israeli administrator. \u201cI haven\u2019t gotten anything from Facebook that \u2018you\u2019ve been posting inappropriate content that\u2019s violated our community standards\u2019 or anything of the sort. I\u2019ve been very fortunate in that regard.\u201d</p> \n<p>As the network grew, so did its ability to influence the thinking of voters. By the time the Australian election came around in May, the pages were providing a significant platform for far-right candidates, including One Nation and Fraser Anning, a senator widely condemned for calling for a \u201cfinal solution\u201d to immigration.</p> \n<p>The network boosted Anning and One Nation with 401 posts in the lead-up to the election, which attracted 82,025 likes, 18,748 comments and 33,730 shares.</p> \n<p>A One Nation spokesman, James Ashby, said the network would not benefit the party, and engagement on leader Pauline Hanson\u2019s personal page was far greater. \u201cI would suggest the 401 posts you refer to has attracted a nanoscopic number of likes, comments and shares in comparison,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>A spokesman for Anning said he was previously unaware of the network and did not believe it had helped his campaign.</p> \n<p>It was a similar story in Canada. In the lead-up to the October election, the network pushed out 80 coordinated posts critical of Trudeau that were liked, shared or commented on 30,000 times.</p> \n<p>In the UK, the network has savaged Corbyn. More than 510 coordinated posts have attacked the Labour leader since mid-2016, attracting 15,384 likes, 17,148 comments and 16,406 shares.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/facebookapp/videos/942418432620984/\">Facebook\u2019s own definition of \u201ccoordinated inauthentic activity\u201d</a> reads like a blueprint for the network the Guardian has uncovered.</p> \n<p>\u201cCoordinated inauthentic behaviour is when groups of pages or people work together to mislead others about who they are or what they\u2019re doing,\u201d Facebook\u2019s head of security policy, Nathaniel Gleicher, explained last year. \u201cWe might take a network down for making it look like it\u2019s being run from one part of the world, when in fact it\u2019s being run from another.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis could be done for ideological purposes or it could be financially motivated. For example, spammers might seek to convince people to click on a link to visit their page or to read their posts.\u201d</p> \n<p>But Villereal said he had not heard from Facebook since the Israel-based administrator began distributing content from his page.</p> \n<p>\u201cI haven\u2019t had no notifications from Facebook or anything like that about the content they\u2019re posting: like spam risk or fake accounts or community violations or anything like that.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Faked news, real consequences</h2> \n<p>In March this year, a 55-year-old Donald Trump supporter from upstate New York, Patrick Carlineo, placed a call to the office of Minnesota Democrat Ilhan Omar.</p> \n<p>After getting through to a staff member, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/19/ilhan-omar-pleads-compassion-man-threatened-her-life-letter\">accused Omar of being a terrorist before saying</a>: \u201cWhy are you working for her, she\u2019s a [expletive] terrorist. Somebody ought to put a bullet in her skull. Back in the day, our forefathers would have put a bullet in her [expletive].\u201d</p> \n<p>Carlineo, who pleaded guilty to placing the call last month, had for years been allowed to post violent and racist content to Facebook. In April, the Guardian revealed how he had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/apr/16/facebook-allowed-violent-posts-by-man-charged-with-ilhan-omar-death-threat\">frequently used the platform to taunt Muslims, attacking them with racist slurs and saying he wished he could confront a group of Muslim politicians with \u201ca bucket of pig blood\u201d</a>.</p> \n<p>The call was not an isolated attack. A Somali American, Omar, 37, is one of the first Muslim women in Congress and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/03/ilhan-omar-hijab-congress-headwear\">first to wear a hijab in the House chamber</a>.

In April the congresswoman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/14/ilhan-omar-trump-9-11-september\">said</a> she faced an increase in death threats after Donald Trump accused her of downplaying the September 11 attacks.</p> \n<p>She is also the most frequent target of the network. In the past two years, the Israeli group has pushed out more than 1,400 posts targeting Omar across the 21-page network which in turn have been \u201cshared\u201d more than 30,000 times.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve said it before and I\u2019ll say it again: Facebook\u2019s complacency is a threat to our democracy,\u201d Omar told the Guardian. \u201cIt has become clear that they do not take seriously the degree to which they provide a platform for white nationalist hate and dangerous misinformation in this country and around the world. And there is a clear reason for this: they profit off it. I believe their inaction is a grave threat to people\u2019s lives, to our democracy and to democracy around the world.\u201d</p> \n<p>In November, a major study into Islamophobia from Charles Sturt University in Australia found a significant jump in the number of violent attacks against Muslim people, particularly women wearing head coverings.</p> \n<p>Faruqi, a frequent target of abuse on and offline, said the far-right was relying on social media to \u201clegitimise their hate and recruit\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cMuslim women politicians tick both of their misogyny and racism boxes, so I end up as a target of a lot of their racist content,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve experienced a huge increase in racist and abusive social media comments, emails, phone calls and even handwritten letters since I\u2019ve been in the public eye. There\u2019s no doubt in my mind that many of the people behind these vile messages are emboldened by others on social media and Facebook pages like this.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022 <em>With David Smith in Washington</em></p>",

          "bodyText": "The message from Israel arrived on an otherwise unremarkable afternoon for 36-year-old Beau Villereal. At his family\u2019s sprawling 42-acre property outside Live Oak in Florida\u2019s rural north, Villereal sat alone in his bedroom trawling for news about Donald Trump to share on the rightwing Facebook page he runs with his mother and father. The messenger, who gave her name as Rochale, asked Villereal to make her an editor of Pissed off Deplorables, a self-described \u201cpro-America page\u201d that feeds its thousands of followers a steady diet of pro-Trump, anti-Islam content. \u201cI totally understand you,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI\u2019m from Israel and this is ... really important to me to share the truth. \u201cPlease give me a chance for a day.\u201d About 1,000 miles north in Staten Island, New York City, Ron Devito was tapping away on his laptop to the 20,000 followers of his pro-Trump Facebook page, Making America 1st, when he received a similar message, this time from someone using the name Tehila. \u201cShe pitched to me that she was a good editor, she could provide some good content to increase likes and views on the page,\u201d Devito told the Guardian. \u201cCould I just give her a chance and let her post her stuff, right? So I figured, \u2018What the heck, give it a shot\u2019.\u201d Villereal and Devito weren\u2019t the only ones. Over the past two years, a group of mysterious Israel-based accounts has delivered similar messages to the heads of at least 19 other far-right Facebook pages across the US, Australia, the UK, Canada, Austria, Israel and Nigeria. A Guardian investigation can reveal those messages were part of a covert plot to control some of Facebook\u2019s largest far-right pages, including one linked to a rightwing terror group, and create a commercial enterprise that harvests Islamophobic hate for profit. This group is now using its 21-page network to churn out more than 1,000 coordinated faked news posts per week to more than 1 million followers, funnelling audiences to a cluster of 10 ad-heavy websites and milking the traffic for profit. The posts stoke deep hatred of Islam across the western world and influence politics in Australia, Canada, the UK and the US by amplifying far-right parties such as Australia\u2019s One Nation and vilifying Muslim politicians such as the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, and the US congresswoman Ilhan Omar. The network has also targeted leftwing politicians at critical points in national election campaigns. It posted false stories claiming the UK Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said Jews were \u201cthe source of global terrorism\u201d and accused the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, of allowing \u201cIsis to invade Canada\u201d. The revelations show Facebook has failed to stop clandestine actors from using its platform to run coordinated disinformation and hate campaigns. The network has operated with relative impunity even since Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s apology to the US Senate following the Cambridge Analytica and Russian interference scandals. When the Guardian notified Facebook of its investigation, the company removed several pages and accounts \u201cthat appeared to be financially motivated\u201d, a spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cThese pages and accounts violated our policy against spam and fake accounts by posting clickbait content to drive people to off-platform sites,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cWe don\u2019t allow people to misrepresent themselves on Facebook and we\u2019ve updated our inauthentic behaviour policy to further improve our ability to counter new tactics.\u201d But this comes too late for some of the network\u2019s victims. Australia\u2019s first female Muslim senator, Mehreen Faruqi, felt the full force of the network in August last year, when 10 of its pages launched coordinated posts inciting their 546,000 followers to attack her for speaking in parliament against racism. The posts prompted what Faruqi described as a \u201chorrific feeding frenzy of racism, fake news and hate\u201d, soliciting vile comments like \u201cput your burka on \u2013 and shut the fuck up!\u201d, \u201cdeport the whining bitch\u201d and \u201cRevoke citizenship and Deport\u201d. Faruqi said the network represented a \u201cnew level of far-right organisation and coordination\u201d, and she places the blame squarely on social media companies. \u201cBy allowing racist and misleading posts, social media giants like Facebook \u2026 are profiteering from the proliferation of hate speech and abuse,\u201d Faruqi said. \u201cFacebook could do much more and shut these pages down but so long as they continue to profit from the reach and engagement, they don\u2019t seem to be interested in decisive action.\u201d A spokesperson for Facebook told the Guardian: \u201cNobody can advocate or advertise hate or violence on Facebook and we remove any violations as soon as we become aware.\u201d \u2018The perfect foot soldiers\u2019 It begins with a single post, curated by Israel-based administrators. The post typically has an attention-grabbing headline and links to an article that mimics the style of a legitimate news story. It employs a blend of distorted news and total fabrication to paint Muslims as sharia-imposing terrorists and child abusers, whose existence poses a threat to white culture and western civilisation. It is then published almost simultaneously to the network\u2019s 21 Facebook pages, which have a combined 1 million followers across the globe. The content is so predictable that even Devito once complained to his Israeli counterpart. \u201cI told her flat out, \u2018you\u2019re a one-trick pony\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s Islam, Islam, Islam, Islam and more Islam. Like, enough with the Islam already, we get it.\u201d The Guardian conducted an analysis to confirm the extent of coordination across the network, checking where posts were identical in content and similar in publication time across different pages. The network published 5,695 coordinated posts at its height in October 2019, receiving 846,424 likes, shares or comments in that month alone. In total, the network has published at least 165,000 posts and attracted 14.3 million likes, shares or comments. The content is amplified further by other far-right Facebook pages, including those run by the rightwing UK Independence party (Ukip), who share it organically. The posts link back to one of 10 near-identical websites masquerading as news sites with generic titles like \u201cThe Politics Online\u201d and \u201cFree Press Front\u201d. Ad-heavy and poorly designed, the websites feature \u201cstories\u201d that usually combine slabs of copied text intermingled with unsourced opinion and graphic imagery. The Guardian worked with researchers from Queensland University of Technology\u2019s digital media research centre, who conducted an analysis of the order in which identical posts appeared across the 21 Facebook pages. Their analysis indicates a single entity is coordinating the publication of content across the Facebook pages, likely using automatic scheduling software, and that a single entity controls the websites that receive traffic from the posts. \u201cIt\u2019s very obvious looking at the websites, the way that they\u2019re structured, the way that they\u2019re sharing design and code, and the way they share Google site IDs, that they\u2019re all interconnected with each other,\u201d said QUT professor Axel Bruns, one of Australia\u2019s leading internet researchers. \u201cThey\u2019re just cheap sites to set up, cheap sites to run \u2026 It\u2019s not very sophisticated and it\u2019s just brute force, to push all this stuff out.\u201d Bruns and his colleagues believe the motivation is commercial, and that hatred, division and political influence may be byproducts of the pursuit of profit. \u201cHere\u2019s a bunch of people who \u2013 they\u2019re not stupid but they\u2019re highly prone to clicking on content that reflects their already held beliefs, especially content that is highly emotive and contains polarising and extreme material,\u201d said Timothy Graham, a senior lecturer on social network analysis at QUT. \u201cThese people are great for business. If you get them to come to your website, they\u2019re not going to [look closely at] the content, they\u2019re going to click through and keep [sharing] it. They\u2019re the perfect foot soldiers.\u201d \u2018You\u2019re the one profiting\u2019 The network wasn\u2019t always so extensive. The delivery of coordinated content began in 2016 through just a few pages in Israel and the US. From 2018 onwards, the network began approaching the administrators of large, pre-existing Facebook pages across Australia, Austria, Canada, the US and the UK, promising content that would help grow their audiences. In March 2018, the network gained access to a Canadian pro-Israel page dubbed Never Again Canada, which has 232,000 followers. A previous BuzzFeed News investigation into Never Again Canada showed it was regularly sharing content about the Jewish Defence League, an FBI-designated rightwing terror group, and coordinating content with other pages. The network reached its peak in October this year with coordination across 21 pages. Each time a local page-owner agrees to let one of the Israeli administrators in, they become unwitting though not necessarily unwilling participants in the globally coordinated distribution of online hate. Some page-owners, like Villereal, who runs Pissed off Deplorables, had no idea their new Israeli counterparts were making money from the following they had built. \u201cIt\u2019s a little disheartening to sit here and think I\u2019ve been doing this for two years and I haven\u2019t made a dime, and I allowed someone to come in who\u2019s built the little back channel but they\u2019re going to use my clientele to make money,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s like I own the store, I built it and everything like that, and you\u2019re the one profiting.\u201d Those behind the network went to great lengths to hide their identities, concealing personal information from websites and using different Facebook profiles when contacting the owners of existing far-right pages. But by following a trail of digital breadcrumbs, the Guardian\u2019s investigation traced the network back to a key player: a man going by the username Ariel1238a. Finding Ariel In December 2017, Ariel1238a made a seemingly benign request for help on an obscure search engine optimisation forum. \u201cI\u2019m looking for more ways to monetize my site,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMy niche is about politics.\u201d For the past two years, the same username has popped up regularly on similar web forums. Writing in broken English, Ariel1238a frets about drops in his click-through rate, the inability to host \u201cviolent content\u201d alongside advertising sourced through Google AdSense, and the low revenue return per-click on native advertising site Taboola. \u201cI\u2019m not satisfied with the profits they bring,\u201d he told one forum. He also complains about Facebook\u2019s efforts to crack down on \u201cfake news\u201d. When the social media giant announced in April that it would step up its efforts to combat misinformation on the site, Ariel wrote: \u201cFacebook has released another step on the way to its end, matter of time.\u201d Ariel1238a is not a web expert. He asks rudimentary questions including how to set up a business email domain and increase traffic to his sites. Yet his websites, he tells the forums, serve \u201cleading countries\u201d including the UK, US, Australia and Canada and have, he boasts, \u201csomthing like 1m pageviews per month\u201d. The posts give no suggestion that Ariel1238a will become a driving force behind a wave of anti-Islamic hate across Facebook. In fact, online profiles linked to Ariel1238a betray no political or ideological position at all. Instead, his digital footprint suggests that before he turned to exploiting the far-right\u2019s obsession with Islam for profit, he had for years engaged in a number of unsophisticated online money-making schemes. A now dormant account on a blog-publishing service links him to a \u201cfree sex dating\u201d site, a \u201creligious dating\u201d site and a fan page for the fourth season of the Israeli Big Brother television series. He has dabbled in online directories for gyms in Tel Aviv, Botox injections, an online sim card store and a site described simply as \u201cOnline sex | Camera sex\u201d. Using web archiving services and domain registry information, the Guardian has been able to confirm the username Ariel1238a belongs to Ariel Elkaras, a 30-something jewellery salesman and online operator living on the outskirts of Tel Aviv. Soon after the Guardian contacted Elkaras for comment, several of the network\u2019s websites were either taken down or had large amounts of content removed. The public posts on his Facebook profile were also removed. Elkaras did not respond to multiple requests for comment via email and phone, but the Guardian was able to track him down. When we turned up at his apartment in a town near Tel Aviv in Israel, an older woman answered the door. She called out to Elkaras, who arrived wearing a T-shirt and sweatpants. Through a translator, Elkaras denied knowledge of or involvement in the network but said he had once been \u201cincluded in a group, something about Israel\u201d. He refused to answer questions about his job, other than to confirm he dealt with computers. \u201cYes, but it\u2019s not your business,\u201d he said. \u201c[The network] is nothing related to me.\u201d When the Guardian asked about the username Ariel1238a, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He closed the door, but shortly after followed a reporter out on to the street and demanded to know how the Guardian had found him. Elkaras was the only real person the Guardian was able to connect to the operation. We were unable to verify whether Rochale, Tehila, or the other names used by the Facebook profiles that contacted page administrators, were the names of real people. Messages obtained by the Guardian show Rochale telling a local page administrator she doesn\u2019t know how to make money online and that she doesn\u2019t know who runs the websites she sources her content from. \u201cI only share posts on your page because this topic is important to me,\u201d she wrote. While initially describing Tehila as \u201ca Pam Geller type\u201d, Devito later admitted he had never actually seen or spoken to her. Asked how he knew she was real, he said: \u201cWe don\u2019t, to be brutally honest.\u201d Of the page administrators who returned requests for comment from the Guardian, only one claimed to have physically seen Tehila via Skype but declined to provide evidence. Asked how he knew he was speaking to a woman, the administrator, who declined to reveal his identity, said: \u201cIt sure looked like one.\u201d None of the page administrators the Guardian spoke to for this story were aware that the Israeli group was making money from the scheme, or that their pages were part of a larger network. \u201cThey weren\u2019t upfront about it because as much as I saw in the message ... there was no talk about making money,\u201d a pro-Trump page administrator based in Nigeria told the Guardian. Political influence and Facebook\u2019s failures In April last year, Zuckerberg sat before an army of cameras and offered a mea culpa to the world. Facebook, still reeling from the Cambridge Analytica scandal, had failed its users, Zuckerberg said. The company had struggled to stop its platform being used for coordinated political interference and the spread of disinformation and hate. \u201cIt\u2019s clear now that we didn\u2019t do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t take a broad enough view of our responsibility, and that was a big mistake. And it was my mistake.\u201d Two months later, the Israeli-based network gained access to its 13th far-right Facebook page, expanding the already sizeable audience for its disinformation. The network has operated with relative impunity for almost two years. \u201cBelieve it or not she hasn\u2019t done anything to get the page in trouble,\u201d Devito said of his Israeli administrator. \u201cI haven\u2019t gotten anything from Facebook that \u2018you\u2019ve been posting inappropriate content that\u2019s violated our community standards\u2019 or anything of the sort. I\u2019ve been very fortunate in that regard.\u201d As the network grew, so did its ability to influence the thinking of voters. By the time the Australian election came around in May, the pages were providing a significant platform for far-right candidates, including One Nation and Fraser Anning, a senator widely condemned for calling for a \u201cfinal solution\u201d to immigration. The network boosted Anning and One Nation with 401 posts in the lead-up to the election, which attracted 82,025 likes, 18,748 comments and 33,730 shares. A One Nation spokesman, James Ashby, said the network would not benefit the party, and engagement on leader Pauline Hanson\u2019s personal page was far greater. \u201cI would suggest the 401 posts you refer to has attracted a nanoscopic number of likes, comments and shares in comparison,\u201d he said. A spokesman for Anning said he was previously unaware of the network and did not believe it had helped his campaign. It was a similar story in Canada. In the lead-up to the October election, the network pushed out 80 coordinated posts critical of Trudeau that were liked, shared or commented on 30,000 times. In the UK, the network has savaged Corbyn. More than 510 coordinated posts have attacked the Labour leader since mid-2016, attracting 15,384 likes, 17,148 comments and 16,406 shares. Facebook\u2019s own definition of \u201ccoordinated inauthentic activity\u201d reads like a blueprint for the network the Guardian has uncovered. \u201cCoordinated inauthentic behaviour is when groups of pages or people work together to mislead others about who they are or what they\u2019re doing,\u201d Facebook\u2019s head of security policy, Nathaniel Gleicher, explained last year. \u201cWe might take a network down for making it look like it\u2019s being run from one part of the world, when in fact it\u2019s being run from another. \u201cThis could be done for ideological purposes or it could be financially motivated. For example, spammers might seek to convince people to click on a link to visit their page or to read their posts.\u201d But Villereal said he had not heard from Facebook since the Israel-based administrator began distributing content from his page. \u201cI haven\u2019t had no notifications from Facebook or anything like that about the content they\u2019re posting: like spam risk or fake accounts or community violations or anything like that.\u201d Faked news, real consequences In March this year, a 55-year-old Donald Trump supporter from upstate New York, Patrick Carlineo, placed a call to the office of Minnesota Democrat Ilhan Omar. After getting through to a staff member, he accused Omar of being a terrorist before saying: \u201cWhy are you working for her, she\u2019s a [expletive] terrorist. Somebody ought to put a bullet in her skull. Back in the day, our forefathers would have put a bullet in her [expletive].\u201d Carlineo, who pleaded guilty to placing the call last month, had for years been allowed to post violent and racist content to Facebook. In April, the Guardian revealed how he had frequently used the platform to taunt Muslims, attacking them with racist slurs and saying he wished he could confront a group of Muslim politicians with \u201ca bucket of pig blood\u201d. The call was not an isolated attack. A Somali American, Omar, 37, is one of the first Muslim women in Congress and the first to wear a hijab in the House chamber. Since her election, she has been a lightning rod for attacks from the right. Political opponents have pushed conspiracy theories and shared violent content about her on social media. In April the congresswoman said she faced an increase in death threats after Donald Trump accused her of downplaying the September 11 attacks. She is also the most frequent target of the network. In the past two years, the Israeli group has pushed out more than 1,400 posts targeting Omar across the 21-page network which in turn have been \u201cshared\u201d more than 30,000 times. \u201cI\u2019ve said it before and I\u2019ll say it again: Facebook\u2019s complacency is a threat to our democracy,\u201d Omar told the Guardian. \u201cIt has become clear that they do not take seriously the degree to which they provide a platform for white nationalist hate and dangerous misinformation in this country and around the world. And there is a clear reason for this: they profit off it. I believe their inaction is a grave threat to people\u2019s lives, to our democracy and to democracy around the world.\u201d In November, a major study into Islamophobia from Charles Sturt University in Australia found a significant jump in the number of violent attacks against Muslim people, particularly women wearing head coverings. Faruqi, a frequent target of abuse on and offline, said the far-right was relying on social media to \u201clegitimise their hate and recruit\u201d. \u201cMuslim women politicians tick both of their misogyny and racism boxes, so I end up as a target of a lot of their racist content,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve experienced a huge increase in racist and abusive social media comments, emails, phone calls and even handwritten letters since I\u2019ve been in the public eye. There\u2019s no doubt in my mind that many of the people behind these vile messages are emboldened by others on social media and Facebook pages like this.\u201d \u2022 With David Smith in Washington",

          "bodyText": "We have a week to go before election day and after the blip that was the Nato summit, the leaders are focused on the final sprint to the 12 December finish line. Boris Johnson has outlined his plan for his first 100 days in office (if he wins) and Labour will be talking education today. You really should follow our rolling political coverage here. What\u2019s going on? The Nato circus has left town \u2013 some members earlier than planned \u2013 which means Johnson can resume campaigning today. The PM survived the summit relatively unscathed. There had been concerns among the Conservative camp that Johnson\u2019s proximity to the US president might be damaging, stoking voter fears that the NHS might be on the table in US-UK trade deals. But he managed to avoid almost any public meetings with Donald Trump, though he was caught on camera apparently joking about Trump with other world leaders \u2013 something Johnson astonishingly professed no memory of. After the video of the interaction did the rounds, Trump called Justin Trudeau \u201ctwo-faced\u201d and then announced he was leaving early and would not be giving a press conference. Don\u2019t miss Marina Hyde\u2019s and John Crace\u2019s take on events. Now that all the Nato shenanigans are out of the way, normal programming can resume. Johnson has launched his hopes for his first 100 days in office. He says his main focus would be passing the withdrawal agreement to ensure Brexit happens on 31 January. Other priorities include bringing in legislation to end the automatic release of serious violent and sexual offenders at the halfway point of their sentence \u2013 the family of murdered student Jack Merritt have condemned this as kneejerk politicisation of the London Bridge terror attack \u2013 and increasing the amount that new immigrants pay to use the NHS. Labour will be talking about education today as Jeremy Corbyn visits schools and the shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, pledges to recruit 20,000 more teachers, cap secondary class sizes at 30 and spend \u00a37bn on repairs and upgrades to England\u2019s crumbling school buildings. Labour will also promise free, healthy breakfasts for all primary-age children as part of a multibillion-pound plan to \u201cpoverty-proof\u201d England\u2019s schools. At a glance The Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, has faced Andrew Neil and apologised for her party backing the coalition\u2019s austerity policies including the bedroom tax and benefit cap. Democracy campaigners have accused politicians of ignoring the issue of electoral reform, arguing that \u201cthe signs of democratic decay are all around us\u201d. Aditya Chakrabortty writes that Boris Johnson may be a clown but the threat he poses is deadly serious. The latest instalment in our People and Power series heads to Camborne and Redruth where creating jobs is high on the agenda in one of Cornwall\u2019s most deprived constituencies. Caroline Lucas has written about the need to protect nature if we are to stand any chance of tackling climate chaos. The day ahead Boris Johnson will head to the Midlands where he will have a tour of a mill shop and inspect some knitwear. Jeremy Corbyn will also be in the Midlands where he will visit several schools before hosting a rally in the evening. Jo Swinson will visit a care home in Edinburgh before appearing at a rally alongside colleagues from the Scottish section of the party. It\u2019s Nigel Farage\u2019s turn to face off against Andrew Neil. The interview will be broadcast at 7.30pm. Sign up here to receive Andrew Sparrow\u2019s afternoon round-up from the campaign trail \u2013 direct to your email inbox. Best of the rest &gt; George Zimmerman is launching a \u00a3100m lawsuit over his unsuccessful prosecution for shooting and killing Trayvon Martin. Zimmerman was acquitted over the 2012 shooting, which happened after he followed the unarmed Martin, 17, around a gated community in Florida, then shot him when they got into an altercation. In the lawsuit, Zimmerman claims his reputation was destroyed by the \u201cmalicious\u201d and conspiratorial prosecution; that he was defamed in a book by Benjamin Crump, the attorney of Martin\u2019s parents; and that he receives death threats. Crump responded by calling Zimmerman\u2019s lawsuit shameless, callous, unfounded and reckless. &gt; An analysis has found 24,600 students disappeared from school rolls in 2018, fuelling concerns about \u201coff-rolling\u201d whereby difficult or low-achieving pupils are excluded so they are not included in GCSE results. The gap between disadvantaged pupils and their better-off peers in England was shown to be much wider than official estimates. Once school results were recalculated to take into account pupils who left before the end of year 11, when GCSEs are taken, researchers found the failure rate for disadvantaged pupils increased by more than double that of better-off pupils. &gt; The Star Wars actor John Boyega says he has met Americans who are not aware there are black people living in London, and believes the under-representation of the black British experience in popular culture fuels such ignorance. Boyega made the comments in a Radio Times interview where he discussed his future plans to create work about black life in Britain, partly as a result of having to explain to Americans that black Londoners exist while promoting his 2011 breakthrough film Attack the Block. He said: \u201cI\u2019m black British and I\u2019m from London. And that in itself is something that the world doesn\u2019t know about yet. I met American people \u2013 civilians of a first-world country \u2013 who were confused that there were black people in London.\u201d Today in Focus podcast: Iran\u2019s deadly protests When Iran\u2019s government announced it was raising the price of fuel by up to three times, thousands of Iranians took to the streets to protest. Michael Safi reports on what happened next. And: Jim Waterson on how social media has changed the way we consume news. Lunchtime read: \u2018They said I would be done for murder\u2019 At 17, Amy Dunne was pregnant with a baby who had a fatal abnormality. She was given a pseudonym and became the focus of a landmark Irish legal case over whether she could have an abortion. Now she is reclaiming her story, as she tells Rory Carroll. Sport Liverpool treated their Merseyside foes with contempt, winning 5-2 in the Premier League and leaving behind the impression that for the Reds, rivalry with Everton is a matter of history, not current concern. The fallout from Anfield will likely carry on and on, with Marco Silva on borrowed time as Everton manager \u2013 and David Moyes lined up for a return to Goodison Park. Still on the Premier League, and Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s return to Old Trafford was not an enjoyable one as a Marcus Rashford-inspired Manchester United recorded a 2-1 win over Tottenham Hotspur. Bob Willis, the former England captain and fast bowler who died at the age of 70, inspired teammates with his excellence, writes Vic Marks. In rugby, Robert Kitson argues that the upcoming, truncated tour of South Africa removes the last vestige of romance from the British &amp; Irish Lions. Back to football, and our countdown of the world\u2019s top 100 female players continues \u2013 check out the talent in positions 100-41. Business Although global shares have lifted again in the last 24 hours on hopes of a US-China trade deal, the tensions underlying relations between the two superpowers were laid bare as Chinese tech giant Huawei said it would challenge the US decision to bar it from federal contracts because it posed a security threat. It comes as Boris Johnson suggested Huawei was a security threat. The FTSE100 is set for a modest rise this morning while the pound has held on to gains it made yesterday at $1.312 and \u20ac1.183. The papers The Times and the Telegraph both lead today with the PM\u2019s tax pledge: \u201cJohnson to offer tax cut after Brexit\u201d in the former, and \u201cTax cuts for millions within days of Brexit\u201d in the latter.

          "bodyText": "Live political reporting continues on Thursday\u2019s blog: Here\u2019s a recap of today: Four constitutional law experts testified on Donald Trump\u2019s conduct rises to the level of impeachable offenses. Three scholars called by Democratic members of the committee said that the president\u2019s handling of Ukraine military aid and the leveraging of his office for personal gain are impeachable offenses. A law professor that the Republicans called to testify said that the evidence is too thin, and the reasons for impeaching the president too narrow to justify a case against the president now. One of the experts, Pamela Karlan, apologized after the First Lady criticized her for punning off Barron Trump\u2019s name to make the point that the president is not a king. Donald Trump cut short his attendance at the Nato summit after a video captured world leaders apparently ridiculing him. The Trump administration approved a new rule that will cut nearly 70,000 people from the federal food stamp program. William Barr\u2019s hand-picked prosecutor wasn\u2019t able to provide evidence that to support right-wing suspicions that the FBI\u2019s Russia investigation was a setup, the Washington Post reports: Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz\u2019s office contacted U.S. Attorney John Durham, the prosecutor Barr personally tapped to lead a separate review of the 2016 probe into possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia, the people said. The inspector general also contacted several U.S. intelligence agencies. Among Horowitz\u2019s questions: whether a Maltese professor who interacted with a Trump campaign adviser was actually a U.S. intelligence asset deployed to ensnare the campaign, the people said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the inspector general\u2019s findings have not been made public. But the intelligence agencies said the professor was not among their assets, the people said. And Durham informed Horowitz\u2019s office that his investigation had not produced any evidence that might contradict the inspector general\u2019s findings on that point. NBC appears to have confirmed the Post\u2019s reporting. The Justice Department IG has an upcoming report investigating the origins of Russia investigation, separate from the one being conducted by Barr\u2019s prosecutor. The House Judiciary Committee is expected to soon announce future hearings, including testimony from the attornies for the Republicans and Democrats on the Hosue Intelligence committee, who will present the reports and findings from the investigation so far. After that, the Judiciary Committee will likely draw up articles of impeachment, vote on them. The exact timing of when all of this will happen is still unclear. It\u2019s also unclear which articles the committee will draft. The House Intelligence report released yesterday makes a case for obstruction of justice and abuse of power. Chairman Nadler gaveled the hearing closed, after delivering his closing remarks. Trump put his own interests above the national interest, Nadler said. Trump asked a\u201cforeign government to intervene in our elections, then got caught, then obstructed the investigators twice.\u201d \u201cThe constitution has a solution for a president who places his personal or political interests above those in the nation, the power of impeachment,\u201d Nadler concluded. When Republican member Louie Gohmert tried to get Nadler\u2019s attention (with a unanimous consent request), Nadler responded \u201cToo late\u201d and banged his gavel. \u201cTypical,\u201d Gohmert could be heard mumbling. A very animated Doug Collins said, \u201cThis is not a time to play hide the ball\u201d and repeatedly called for Intelligence Committee chair Adam Schiff testify before the Judiciary Committee. He said it was \u201ctoo early\u201d to hold these hearings and that lawmakers had not talked to enough \u201cfact witnesses\u201d. The Democrats, he said, are \u201cso obsessed with the election next year, they just gloss over things.\u201d Collins also repeated a Republican talking point that Ukraine only became aware that aid was being withheld \u201cone month after\u201d the Trump-Zelenskiy phone call. However, Pentagon official Laura Cooper testified that Ukraine was aware of the aid in early July, before the call. Representative Jerry Nadler, the leading Democrat on the committee, and Doug Collins, the leading Republican are now giving closing statements. Read the key takeaways from today\u2019s testimonies: Pamela Karlan made a distinction between Trump\u2019s political positions on foreign affairs and his right to solicit electoral interference from foreign powers. \u201cYes there is political influence in our foreign affairs,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve exited climate accords, we\u2019ve taken different positions on Nato than we would have taken if his opponent won.\u201d That\u2019s different from partisan politics in the context of electoral manipulation, she said. \u201cIf we get over that or get used to that, we will cease to become the democracy that we are now\u201d Witness Pamela Karlan apologized for making a put out of Barron Trump\u2019s name. \u201cIt was wrong of me to do that...I do regret having said that,\u201d she said, adding that she\u2019s happy to apologize though the president hasn\u2019t apologized for offensive comments he\u2019s made in the past. Earlier, Michael Johnson, a Republican representative from Louisiana, read a tweet by First Lady Melania Trump criticizing Karlan\u2019s comment into the public record of the hearing. In other non-impeachment political news, the Trump administration approved a rule that will remove nearly 700,000 people from the federal food-stamp program by tightening work requirements for recipients. From the AP: The move by the administration is the latest in its attempt to scale back the social safety net for low-income Americans. It is the first of three proposed rules targeting the Supplemental Nutrition Program, known as SNAP, to be finalized. The program feeds more than 36 million people. The plan, announced Wednesday, will limit states from exempting work-eligible adults from having to maintain steady employment in order to receive benefits. The Agriculture Department estimates the change would save roughly $5.5 billion over five years and cut benefits for roughly 688,000 SNAP recipients... The final rule will be published in the federal register Thursday, and go into effect in April. Meanwhile, elsewhere on Capitol Hill... Those still holed up in the Judiciary Committee hearing can reportedly hear echoes of holiday cheer filtering in from the outside world. Several Republicans committee members have read from the memo that Donald Trump released summarizing his July 25 call with the Ukrainian president. \u201cThey never mentioned the 2020 election. They never mentioned military aid,\u201d Kelly Armstrong, a Republican representative from North Dakota, said just now. Though the rough transcript of the call that Trump released may not contain the phrase \u201c2020 election\u201d, the president does clearly ask Ukraine to conduct investigations, including into Biden, one of his leading rivals in the upcoming elections. The transcript also shows that Trump transitions directly from talk of military aid that the Ukrainian president says his country needs to talk of a \u201cfavor\u201d that Trump needs. Pushing back against arguments made by Jonathan Turley, who said that Democrats didn\u2019t have enough evidence to make a case for impeachment at this point, Michael Gerhardt said that lawmakers have tried to gather more evidence. \u201cI might just point out that one of the difficulties with asking for a more thorough investigation is that\u2019s exactly what the House has tried to conduct here,\u201d he said, \u201cThe president has refused to comply with subpoenas and other requests for documents.\u201d Val Demmings, the Democratic representative from Florida who questioned Gerhardt, agreed that Trump was \u201cdesperate\u201d to prevent investigations into his actions. \u201cThe president\u2019s obstruction of Congress is pervasive,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are facing a categorically blockade by a president who is desperate to prevent any investigation into his wrongdoing.\u201d \u201cHas a president ever refused to cooperate in an impeachment investigation?\u201d Demmings asked. \u201cNot until now.\u201d Gerhardt responded. Pramila Jayapal, a Democratic representative from Washington, is now questioning Pamela Karlan. Jayapal asked Karlan what Trump\u2019s behavior reveals about the credibility of his claim that he was most concerned about corruption. What, for example, does it mean that Trump allegedly insisted that the Ukrainian president publicly announce an investigation? \u201cGenerally you don\u2019t announce the investigation in a criminal case before you conduct it, because it puts the person under notice that they\u2019re under investigation,\u201d Karlan said. As for credibility, Karlan said, \u201cI think you ought to make that credibility determination because you have the sole power of impeachment. if I were a member of the House of Representatives I would infer that he was doing it for political reasons.\u201d The House judiciary committee is still holding its first public impeachment hearing, but I\u2019m handing the blog over to my west coast colleague Maanvi Singh for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Three legal experts called by Democratic members of the House judiciary committee testified that Trump\u2019s actions toward Ukraine constituted impeachable offenses, a position that was contradicted by the only witness called by Republican members of the panel. The first lady, the White House and Trump\u2019s reelection campaign denounced one of today\u2019s legal experts, Pamela Karlan, after the Stanford law professor made a pun out of Barron Trump\u2019s name. \u201cThe president can name his son Barron, but he can\u2019t make him a baron,\u201d Karlan said. Democratic congressman Denny Heck, a member of the House intelligence committee, announced he would not seek reelection \u2013 citing his desire to spend more time with family and his chagrin over the Republican response to the impeachment inquiry. Rudy Giuliani reportedly traveled to Europe this week to meet with former Ukrainian prosecutors who helped spread baseless corruption allegations against Joe Biden, even though the president\u2019s personal lawyer is under a microscope because of the impeachment inquiry. Trump canceled his final press conference at the Nato summit in London after a video surfaced of world leaders mocking the president\u2019s lengthy comments to reporters yesterday. Maanvi will have more coming up, so stay tuned. The first lady has now added her voice to the Republican chorus criticizing Pamela Karlan, accusing the Stanford law professor of invading the privacy of her son by making a pun out of Barron Trump\u2019s name. Karlan said earlier at today\u2019s hearing, \u201cThe president can name his son Barron, but he can\u2019t make him a baron,\u201d making a point about the constitution not allowing the president to distribute titles of nobility. Republicans are now arguing that the mere mention of Barron\u2019s name equates to a political attack meant to drag the first son into the impeachment inquiry. Republican congressman Tom McClintock began his five minutes of questions by asking the legal experts testifying today if they had voted for Trump in the 2016 election. This question sparked immediate pushback from Stanford law professor Pamela Karlan, who argued the witnesses should not have to disclose how they cast their ballots. Chairman Jerry Nadler interjected to say that McClintock was free to ask the question but witnesses were not obligated to answer. None of the witnesses raised their hands to say they voted for Trump, but Harvard law professor Noah Feldman emphasized the lack of response should not be taken as a sign that they oppose the president. The House judiciary committee has reconvened its first public impeachment hearing, and members of the panel have resumed their five-minute rounds of questioning of today\u2019s witnesses. Republican congressman Andy Biggs kicked off questioning after the brief recess, and Democratic congressman Ted Lieu is now speaking. After Lieu, there should be 18 members of the panel left, so the hearing could conclude around 6pm ET, but it may stretch even longer. The House judiciary committee has once again recessed its impeachment hearing for five minutes, with more than a dozen members of the panel still needing to question today\u2019s witnesses. Just before chairman Jerry Nadler briefly adjourned the hearing, Democratic congressman Eric Swalwell accused George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley of acting as the Republicans\u2019 defense attorney in support of the president. \u201cThat\u2019s not my intention, sir,\u201d Turley replied. The president\u2019s reelection campaign has now called on Democrats to repudiate Stanford law professor Pamela Karlan for making a pun out of Barron Trump\u2019s name to make a point about the Constitution not allowing presidents to distrubute titles of nobility. \u201cEvery Democrat in Congress should immediately repudiate Pamela Karlan and call on her to personally apologize to the President and the First Lady for mocking their son on national TV,\u201d said Kayleigh McEnany, the Trump campaign\u2019s national press secretary. Karlan initially said at today\u2019s hearing, \u201cThe president can name his son Barron, but he can\u2019t make him a baron,\u201d prompting some laughter in the hearing room. Republican congressman Matt Gaetz used his five minutes of questioning to criticize the three legal experts called by Democrats on the House judiciary committee for previously donating to Democratic candidates. Gaetz especially went after Stanford law professor Pamela Karlan, asking why she donated $2,000 to Hillary Clinton. Karlan responded that she had been donating a lot of money at the time because of all the \u201cpoor\u201d people in the United States. Gaetz also accused Karlan of being \u201cmean\u201d for making a pun out of the name of the president\u2019s son, Barron Trump. As Karlan was trying to respond to Gaetz\u2019s questions, the congressman told the only woman on the panel, \u201cYou don\u2019t get to interrupt me on this time.\u201d After two weeks of high-stakes hearings that included \u201cstar witnesses,\u201d an attache with the cadence and authority of Walter Cronkite, a decorated do-gooder in uniform, a British-born Russia expert who inspired fan clubs around the world and a bombshell-lobbing hotelier-turned ambassador, the distinguished panel of academics was perhaps not the made-for-TV cast these impeachment hearings had thrived on. The witnesses painted in vivid detail the actions of a president hellbent on pressuring a foreign government to harm his political rival. By contrast the professors\u2019 testimony was conceptual and high-minded. They legitimized their assertions with quotations from the Founding Fathers, references to historical treaties and pleasantries that might require an advanced degree to follow. Words like \u201cperfidy\u201d and \u201cnecromancy\u201d obscured their more relatable references to a pet goldendoodle and Thanksgiving dinner. But aside from snarky tweets, the dulcet testimony is also providing Democrats a clear rationale for removing Trump from office that they can clip and reference in the weeks to come. \u201cIf we cannot impeach a president who abuses his office for personal advantage, we no longer live in a democracy,\u201d said Noah Feldman, a professor at Harvard Law School. \u201cWe live in a monarchy or we live under a dictatorship.\u201d White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham lashed out against Stanford law professor Pamela Karlan for making a pun out of Barron Trump\u2019s name during today\u2019s impeachment hearing. Grisham accused Karlan of disrepecting the first son\u2019s privacy by making his name a punchline. \u201cWhat is being done to this country is no laughing matter,\u201d Grisham said. It\u2019s important to note Karlan was not at all mocking Barron Trump himself. She used his name to make a light-hearted joke about how presidents cannot distribute titles of nobility. \u201cThe president can name his son Barron, but he can\u2019t make him a baron,\u201d Karlan said, prompting some laughter in the hearing room. Meanwhile, as the House judiciary committee\u2019s impeachment hearing continues, a Republican congressman is pressing Senate judiciary committee chairman Lindsey Graham to subpoena the phone records of Adam Schiff and Joe Biden, among others. The request comes after the release of the House intelligence committee\u2019s report on the impeachment inquiry, which included call records from Rudy Giuliani and one of his former associates, Lev Parnas. The records showed Giuliani in contact with Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House intelligence committee, and an official at the office of management and budget as the president\u2019s personal lawyer started peddling baseless corruption allegations againt Biden. Republican congressman Jim Jordan, who also participated in the House intelligence committee hearings, complained that Democrats were overseeing a \u201cpre-determined impeachment.\u201d Like the previous two Republican members, Jordan did not pose a single question to today\u2019s witnesses during his five-minute round of questioning, instead choosing to simply criticize the inquiry writ large. Republican congressman Louie Gohmert used his five minutes of questioning to criticize the process of the impeachment inquiry and demand that other witnesses linked to Joe Biden be made to testify, which has 0% chance of approval by the panel\u2019s Democratic majority. Republican congressman Steve Chabot just completed his five-minute round of questioning -- which he used to deliver a diatribe against chairman Jerry Nadler without posing a single question to today\u2019s witnesses. Chabot accused Nadler of reversing himself from his comments about impeachment during Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency and argued the inquiry was preventing the panel from addressing other matters. Those talking points echo comments from Trump, who has accused the \u201cdo nothing Democrats\u201d of neglecting their constituents\u2019 needs. Stanford law professor Pamela Karlan has just delivered another line that is sure to be replayed many times after today\u2019s impeachment hearing. Responding to questions from Democratic congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, Karlan was arguing that the Constitution makes a point to distinguish between the powers of the president and the powers of a monarch. Karlan specifically cited the president\u2019s inability to distribute titles of nobility. \u201cSo while the president can name his son Barron, he cannot make him a baron,\u201d Karlan joked. The first Republican questioner after the recess was Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, who was an impeachment manager during Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency. Sensenbrenner used the first four minutes of his questioning to criticize the impeachment inquiry before posing a single question to Jonathan Turley, the only witness called by Republican members of the panel. Then his time was up. Chairman Jerry Nadler has once again gaveled in the first public impeachment hearing conducted by his panel, the House judiciary committee. The panel will continue with five-minute rounds of questions from the members of the committee, which could take another three hours or so. For reference, this hearing began almost five hours ago. Democrats on the House judiciary committee have been told to stay in Washington this weekend so the panel can complete work related to the impeachment inquiry. It\u2019s unclear what work chairman Jerry Nadler hopes for the members to complete, but it could include mock hearings regarding the Huse intelligence committee\u2019s newly released report on the impeachment inquiry. The Senate has released its calendar for 2020, but the chamber has left the month of January blank in case the House passes articles of impeachment and a trial needs to be held on whether to remove Trump from office. If the House passes articles of impeachment later this month, as it is widely expected to do, the Senate would likely take up the charges in January. Unless two-thirds of senators rule against the president, which is highly improbable, Trump will be acquitted and remain in office. Neal Katyal, a former acting solicitor general under Barack Obama, accused Republicans on the House judiciary committee of misrepresenting his words by only quoting a portion of his comments about Hunter Biden in his book \u201cImpeach: The Case Against Donald Trump.\u201d In the book, Katyal makes a point to emphasize that while Biden\u2019s conduct was not right, it also wasn\u2019t illegal -- as the business dealings of Trump\u2019s family while he is in office are not illegal. The House judiciary committee is not likely to reconvene for another 30 minutes, which could mean the impeachment hearing will not conclude for another four hours or so. Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren opened her questioning of today\u2019s witnesses by noting that she has been present for all three modern impeachments -- as a staffer during Richard Nixon\u2019s impeachment and as a lawmaker during Bill Clinton\u2019s. After Lofgren had concluded her questioning, chairman Jerry Nadler recessed the hearing for members to go vote on the House floor. Dozens of committee members still need to have the chance to question the witnesses, so we will be here for a while. The House judiciary committee\u2019s impeachment hearing has moved on to five-minute rounds of questioning from each member, which could run more than three hours long if everyone uses up their full time. Representative Denny Heck, a Democratic member of the House intelligence committee, has announced he will retire from Congress after serving four terms in the chamber. Heck cited his decades of public service, considering his years in the Washington state legislature, and his discouragement with the Russia investigation as reasons for his departure. \u201cIt is incredible work but it takes its toll. Being away so much from Paula, my best friend and wife of nearly 44 years, can be lonely even when I am in a crowded room,\u201d Heck said. \u201cAt our age, however many \u2018good years\u2019 we have left together is not a growing number. \u201cIn the spirit of complete openness, part of me is also discouraged. The countless hours I have spent in the investigation of Russian election interference and the impeachment inquiry have rendered my soul weary. I will never understand how some of my colleagues, in many ways good people, could ignore or deny the President\u2019s unrelenting attack on a free press, his vicious character assassination of anyone who disagreed with him, and his demonstrably very distant relationship with the truth.\u201d The Republican counsel has concluded his questioning of the legal experts today, but he spent his time only posing questions to lone GOP witness Jonathan Turley -- pursuing a similar strategy as the Democratic counsel. Chairman Jerry Nadler noted this would have been the time when the White House had an opportunity to question the qitnesses, but the president declined the invitation. The panel has now moved on to five minutes of questioning from each member, beginning with Nadler. George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley, the only witness called by Republicans, criticized Democrats for not winning over more members of the opposite party about impeachment. \u201cIf you rush this impeachment, you\u2019re going to leave half the country behind,\u201d Turley warned. \u201cThis is not an impulse buy item.\u201d Paul Taylor, a longtime Republican staffer on the House judiciary committee, is now posing questions to the legal experts testifying today. (Well, so far he has only posed questions to the one witness Republicans called -- deploying the same strategy that Democrats pursued.) White House counsel Pat Cipollone is on Capitol Hill today, although he is not participating in the House judiciary committee\u2019s impeachment hearing. The president was given the option to have a lawyer represent him at today\u2019s hearing, but the White House declined to do so. A Capitol Hill reporter said Cipollone was meeting with senators \u201cas part of an ongoing effort to keep Senate Republicans informed about White House thinking.\u201d A New York Times reporter noted that Jonathan Turley\u2019s argument about the impeachment inquiry moving at a record pace is actually up for debate. George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley, who was called to testify by the Republicans on the House judiciary committee, argued members of Congress were abusing their power by moving quickly on the impeachment inquiry. \u201cFast is not good for impeachment. Fast and narrow impeachments have failed,\u201d Turley said, citing the example of former President Andrew Johnson, who was impeached in 1868 before being narrowly acquitted by the Senate. \u201cIf you make a high crime and misdemeanor out of going to the courts, it\u2019s an abuse of power,\u201d Turley told the lawmakers. \u201cIt\u2019s your abuse of power.\u201d George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley, the only witness at today\u2019s impeachment hearing who was called by Republicans on the House judiciary committee, argued Trump\u2019s actions toward Ukraine do not represent a \u201cclear case of bribery.\u201d Those comments clash with testimony from Stanford professor Pamela Karlan, who told the panel that Trump would be guilty of bribery if investigators concluded the president requested an investigation into Joe Biden to advance his political interests. Congressman Doug Collins also opened his questioning by joking that George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley, the only witness called to testify by the Republican minority of the House judiciary committee, was \u201cwell rested\u201d after only being asked one question by the Democratic counsel. Representative Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House judiciary committee, opened his questioning by noting the freezing conditions of today\u2019s hearing room. Chairman Jerry Nadler has gaveled back in the House judiciary committee\u2019s impeachment hearing, and the Republican ranking member and Republican counsel will now be allowed to pose questions to the four legal experts testifying today. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: The House judiciary committee is in the midst of holding its first public impeachment hearing, where three legal experts have testified that Trump\u2019s actions toward Ukraine constitute impeachable behavior. (A fourth expert has testified the president\u2019s behavior does not meet the constitutional standard for impeachment.) House Democrats held a closed-door meeting this morning, where members signaled their willingness to move forward with the impeachment inquiry despite the White House\u2019s refusal to cooperate. Trump left the Nato summit in London without holding his scheduled final press conference after a video surfaced of world leaders seeming to mock the US president for his lengthy comments to reporters. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. House Democrats held a closed-door meeting this morning to discuss the intelligence committee\u2019s report on the impeachment inquiry, which was released yesterday, and next steps in the investigation. The Washington Post reports: According to multiple Democratic lawmakers who attended a closed-door Capitol meeting, [speaker Nancy] Pelosi announced no firm decision or timeline in moving toward Trump\u2019s impeachment. But, a day after [Adam] Schiff delivered a 300-page report detailing charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress against Trump, she made clear what lay ahead in the House. \u2018Are you ready?\u2019 Pelosi (D-Calif.) asked her colleagues, after describing the grave constitutional circumstances posed by Trump\u2019s alleged wrongdoing surrounding his dealings with Ukraine and his subsequent decision to stonewall the House investigation into it. The caucus, according to multiple members, erupted with shouts of approval. \u2018We\u2019re moving forward,\u2019 said one member, summarizing the thrust of Pelosi\u2019s remarks and speaking on condition of anonymity to candidly describe a private meeting. \u2018We\u2019ve got a job to do whether people want to testify or not.\u2019 Pelosi then turned the room over to Schiff (D-Calif.), who received a standing ovation before saying a word, the members said. From the department of \u201cyou really can\u2019t make this up\u201d: the New York Times is reporting that Rudy Giuliani traveled to Europe this week to meet with former Ukrainian prosecutors who have pushed baseless corruption allegations against Joe Biden. The Times reports: Mr. Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, met in Budapest on Tuesday with a former Ukrainian prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko, who has become a key figure in the impeachment inquiry. He then traveled to Kyiv on Wednesday seeking to meet with other former Ukrainian prosecutors whose claims have been embraced by Republicans, including Viktor Shokin and Kostiantyn H. Kulyk, according to people familiar with the effort. The former prosecutors, who have faced allegations of corruption, all played some role in promoting claims about former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a former United States ambassador to Ukraine and Ukrainians who disseminated damaging information about Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, in 2016. House judiciary committee chairman Jerry Nadler has just called for a 10-minute recess in the panel\u2019s impeachment hearing, which will almost certainly become more like a 20-minute break. When the committee regroups, the Republican ranking member and Republican counsel will be given the chance to pose questions to the four legal experts testifying today. During the House judiciary committee\u2019s impeachment hearing, the panel\u2019s Democrats displayed a sign appearing to indicate they are considering three articles of impeachment against Trump: abuse of power and bribery, obstruction of Congress and obstruction of justice. Democratic counsel Norm Eisen asked the legal experts testifying at today\u2019s impeachment hearing whether the effort to pressure Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden was an impeachable act, even though the countryultimately did not launch the probe. \u201cThe attempt itself is the impeachable act,\u201d said Harvard law professor Noah Feldman, who noted that Richard Nixon\u2019s efforts to cover up the Watergate break-in were ultimately unsuccessful. But the attempts themselves clearly constituted impeachable behavior, Feldman said. Pamela Karlan and Michael Gerhardt echoed that opinion with hypothetical situations emphasizing the soliciation itself is the issue. University of North Carolina law professor Michael Gerhardt warned that lawmakers could set a dangerous precedent if they didn\u2019t impeach Trump for his actions toward Ukraine. \u201cIf what we\u2019re talking about is not impeachable, then nothing is impeachable,\u201d Gerhardt said. Stanford professor Pamela Karlan emphasized she had spent her Thanksgiving break reading the transcripts from the impeachment hearings, implicitly criticizing Republican congressman Doug Collins for implying today\u2019s witnesses had not had time to consider all the evidence. Stanford law professor Pamela Karlan said Trump\u2019s actions toward Ukraine meet the constitutional definition of bribery, adding credibility to Democrats\u2019 usage of the term to describe the allegations against the president. Karlan said that, if lawmakers conclude Trump requested an investigation into Joe Biden and his son for political gain, \u201cthen yes, you have bribery here,\u201d the law professor said. Harvard law professor Noah Feldman warned that the US would turn into a monarchy if its presidents cannot be impeached for using the office for personal or political gain. Democratic counsel Norm Eisen pressed Jonathan Turley, the only legal expert called to testify by Republican members of the House judiciary committee, about his Wall Street Journal op-ed on the impeachment inquiry. Eisen noted that Turley, who has argued that Trump\u2019s actions in the Ukraine controversy do not meet the constitutional standard for impeachment, wrote in the op-ed, \u201cThere is much that is worthy of investigation in the Ukraine scandal, and it is true that impeachment doesn\u2019t require a crime.\u201d Turley confirmed he had written that but he attempted to elaborate on the argument before being cut off by Eisen, who said he was only seeking a \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d answer on whether Turley had in fact written that. Democratic counsel Norm Eisen has now been recognized for 45 minutes of questioning, and he has started by focusing on Trump\u2019s alleged abuses of power and whether those actions constitute impeachable offenses. All three of the witnesses called by Democrats -- Noah Feldman from Harvard, Pamela Karlan from Stanford and Michael Gerhardt from the University of North Carolina -- agreed those actions met the constitutional standard for impeachable offenses. Chairman Jerry Nadler asked University of North Carolina law professor Michael Gerhardt what concerns should be raised by Trump\u2019s refusal to cooperate with congressional subpoenas in the impeachment inquiry. \u201cWhen the president does that, the separation of powers means nothing.\u201d Gerhardt said. The hearing has now moved on to questioning by the members of the House judiciary committee, beginning with chairman Jerry Nadler. The California Democrat began by asking Stanford law professor Pamela Karlan about the danger of a president inviting election interference from a foreign power. Karlan warned that such a request \u201ctakes the right away from the American people\u201d to determine the winners of elections. The four legal experts testifying at today\u2019s public imeachment hearing have concluded their opening statements, and the Republicans on the House judiciary committee have now forced another prcedural vote on subpoenaing the whistleblower whose complaint kicked off the inquiry. A Democratic member of the panel unsurprisingly responded with a proposal to table (or kill) the motion, which was adopted along party lines. George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley, the only witness called by the Republican members of the House judiciary committee, began his opening statement by noting he is not a supporter of the president and did not vote for Trump in 2016. However, the professor expressed fear about this inquiry setting a dangerous precedent for impeachment. \u201cI am concerned about lowering impeachment standards to fit a paucity of evidence and an abundance of anger,\u201d Turley said. Turley also offered a joke about the current divsion in the country. \u201cI get it, you\u2019re mad. The president\u2019s mad ... My wife is mad. My kids are mad. Even my dog seems mad,\u201d Turley said. And he noted his dog, a goldendoodle named Luna, is never mad. But he added, \u201cWill a slipshod impeachment make us less mad or will it only give an invitation for the madness to follow in every future administration?\u201d University of North Carolina law professor Michael Gerhardt similarly argued in his opening statement that Trump has participated in several acts that constitute impeachable behavior. \u201cThe record compiled thus far shows that the president has committed several impeachable offenses, including bribery, abuse of power in soliciting a personal favor from a foreign leader to benefit his political campaign, obstructing Congress, and obstructing justice,\u201d Gerhardt said. The law professor closed by warning, \u201cIf Congress fails to impeach here, then the impeachment process has lost all meaning, and, along with that, our Constitution\u2019s carefully crafted safeguards against the establishment of a king on American soil.\u201d Stanford law professor Pamela S. Karlan closed her opening statement by arguing the presidnet should not be inviting election interference but rather warning any country who threatens to do it. \u201cA president who cared about the Constitution would say \u2018Russia, if you\u2019re listening, butt out of our elections,\u2019\u201d Karlan said, referring to Trump\u2019s famous line requesting that the Kremlin try to find Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails in 2016. In her opening statement, Stanford law professor Pamela S. Karlan echoed Noah Feldman\u2019s argument that Trump\u2019s communications with Ukraine represented a clear abuse of power. \u201cWhen President Trump invited \u2014 indeed, demanded \u2014 foreign involvement in our upcoming election, he struck at the very heart of what makes this a republic,\u201d Karlan said. \u201cThat demand ... constituted an abuse of power.\u201d Stanford law professor Pamela S. Karlan took a shot at Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House judiciary committee, in her opening statement after the congressman implied the legal experts testifying today may not have reviewed all the evidence gathered in the impeachement inquiry. Karlan said she was \u201cinsulted\u201d by Collins\u2019 suggestion that she has not carefully considered the facts of the investigation. As the members of the House judiciary committee took yet another procedural vote forced by the Republicans on the panel, Trump weighed in on the hearing from London. Speaking to reporters following the Nato summit, Trump questioned Democrats\u2019 loyalty to the US. \u201cYou almost question whether or not they love our country and that\u2019s a very serious thing: Do they love our country?\u201d the president said, according to the pool report. Trump added he considered impeachment to be a \u201cdirty word\u201d that \u201cshould only be used in special occasions.\u201d \u201cThis should never happen to a president again what\u2019s happened here,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s an absolute disgrace to our country.\u201d Harvard law professor Noah Feldman used his opening statement to argue Trump\u2019s actions, as described during last month\u2019s hearings conducted by the House intelligence committee, clearly meet the constitutional standard for impeachment. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s conduct described in the testimony and evidence clearly constitutes an impeachable high crime and misdemeanor under the Constitution,\u201d Feldman said. \u201cAccording to the testimony and to the publicly released memorandum of the July 25, 2019, telephone call between the two presidents, President Trump abused his office by soliciting the president of Ukraine to investigate his political rivals in order to gain personal political advantage, including in the 2020 presidential election. This act on its own qualifies as an impeachable high crime and misdemeanor.\u201d The witneeses for today\u2019s impeachment hearing have been sworn in, and the first legal expert, Noah Feldman from Harvard law school, has started to deliver his opening statement. But before Feldman could begin speaking, Republicans on the House judiciary committee once again tried to interrupt the hearing with a procedural motion. Chairman Jerry Nadler replied that the motion would be recognized in between the witnesses\u2019 opening statements, and Feldman continued with his prepared remarks. Thirty minutes into the House judiciary committee\u2019s first public impeachment hearing, the panel\u2019s Republican minority forced a vote on a motion to force Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House intelligence committee, to testify. A Democratic member of the panel responded by proposing to table (or kill) the motion, which was approved by the committee along party lines. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House judiciary committee, closed his opening statement by condemning the impeachment inquiry as a \u201csimple railroad job\u201d against the president. The Georgia Republican claimed the impeachment inquiry began with \u201ctears in Brooklyn,\u201d referring to Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 loss to Trump. Collins closed out by mildly mocking the witnesses at today\u2019s hearing. \u201cWe\u2019ve got law professors here,\u201d Collins said. \u201cWhat a start to a party.\u201d Doug Collins, the ranking member of the House judiciary committee, used his opening statement to reiterate some of the most consistent talking points from the president\u2019s allies. Collins claimed Democrats were only pursuing the impeachment inquiry because they were fearful of Trump\u2019s reelection prospects and had been hellbent on getting the president out of office since he was inaugurated. \u201cIf you want to know what is really driving this: it\u2019s called the clock and the calendar,\u201d Collins said. \u201cThey want to do it before the end of the year.\u201d The Georgia Republican also joked that today\u2019s hearing, featuring testimony from legal experts on the constitutional standard for impeachment, would show Americans \u201cwhy most people don\u2019t go to law school.\u201d Chairman Jerry Nadler closed his opening statement by pushing back against some Republicans\u2019 argument that Democrats should postpone the impeachment investigation, given that the 2020 election is less than a year away. \u201cWe cannot wait for the election to address the present crisis,\u201d Nadler said at the start of his panel\u2019s first public impeachment hearing. \u201cThe integrity of that election is one of the very things at stake.\u201d Chairman Jerry Nadler pointed to the report from special counsel Robert Mueller, which outlines Trump\u2019s obstruction of his investigation, to argue there is \u201cprecedent for recommending impeachment here.\u201d \u201cLadies and gentlemen, the storm in which we find ourselves today was set in motion by President Trump,\u201d Nadler said in his opening statement. \u201cI do not wish this moment on the country. But we have each taken an oath to protect the Constitution, and the facts before us are clear.\u201d Chairman Jerry Nadler used his opening statement to outline the accusations against Trump and criticize the president for not cooperating with the impeachment inquiry. Nadler noted the two other modern presidents who have faced impeachment -- Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton -- turned over considerable evidence to congressional investigators. \u201cPresident Trump, by contrast, has refused to produce a single document and directed every witness not to testify,\u201d Nadler said. Chairman Jerry Nadler could not even begin his opening statement before he was interrupted twice by Republican members of the House judiciary committee raising procedural questions. Viewers of the hearing can expect a lot of those motions from the minority today. Jerry Nadler, the chairman of the House judiciary committee, has gaveled in his panel\u2019s first public hearing in the impeachment inquiry -- which will feature testimony from legal experts on the constitutional standard for impeaching a president. The first public impeachment hearing conducted by the House judiciary committee is set to get underway in just a few minutes, but House Democrats are simultaneously meeting to discuss next steps in the inquiry. Speaker Nancy Pelosi enforced unusually strict rules for members entering the meeting, not even allowing staffers to attend. Trump\u2019s abrupt decision to cancel his press conference at the end of the Nato summit prompted surprise and frustration from the reporters gathered in London to pose questions to the president. Meanwhile, over on Capitol Hill, Republicans on the House judiciary committee are following the example of their intelligence committee counterparts by displaying signs disparaging the impeachment inquiry. Trump has just announced that he will depart the Nato summit in London today without holding his press conference, which was scheduled to take place at 10:30 a.m. ET. While taking questions from reporters this morning, Trump had suggested he may cancel the scheduled press conference, but more details were not immediately available from the White House. Now the president has confrmed he will not be holding the press conference after talking to reporters for more than two hours yesterday. But the abrupt decision may have less to do with his lengthy comments yesterday and more so to do with his fellow foreign leaders appearing to mock him yesterday for his rambling press conferences. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson denied that he, French President Emmanuel Macron and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau were mocking Trump yesterday when they were caught on a hot mic joking about someone\u2019s late appearance at an event due to a long press conference. Follow the Guardian\u2019s UK politics live blog for more updates from Jonhson\u2019s press conference at the Nato summit. Today\u2019s impeachment hearing conducted by the House judiciary committee will feature testimony from four law professors -- Noah Feldman from Harvard University, Michael Gerhardt from the University of North Carolina, Pamela S. Karlan from Stanford University and Jonathan Turley from George Washington University. The opening statements from the four witnesses were released this morning, and they feature some drastically varying interpretations of the president\u2019s actions, as described during last month\u2019s hearings conducted by the House intelligence committee. \u201cIf Congress fails to impeach here, then the impeachment process has lost all meaning, and, along with that, our Constitution\u2019s carefully crafted safeguards against the establishment of a king on American soil,\u201d Gerhardt intends to say. \u201cNo one, not even the president, is beyond the reach of our Constitution and our laws.\u201d But Turley, the only witnesses called by Republicans on the House judiciary committee, argues in his opening statement that a Trump impeachment could set a dangerous precedent. \u201cI get it. You are mad. The President is mad. My Democratic friends are mad. My Republican friends are mad. My wife is mad. My kids are mad. Even my dog is mad . . . and Luna is a golden doodle and they are never mad,\u201d Turley intends to say. \u201cWe are all mad and where has it taken us? Will a slipshod impeachment make us less mad or will it only give an invitation for the madness to follow in every future administration?\u201d As the House judiciary committee prepares to hold its first public impeachment hearing, Trump continues to insult world leaders at the Nato summit in London. The US president called Justin Trudeau \u201ctwo-faced\u201d after the Canadian prime minister was caught on video apparently mocking Trump for his long press conferences. (Trump spoke to reporters for more than two hours yesterday between three different appearances.) \u201cWell, he\u2019s two-faced,\u201d Trump said when asked about the comments by a reporter. But he quickly added, \u201cAnd with Trudeau, he\u2019s a nice guy. I find him to be a nice guy, but the truth is, I called him out on the fact that he\u2019s not paying 2%, and I guess he\u2019s not very happy about it.\u201d During his press conference with Trudeau yesterday, Trump urged Canada to contribute more toward Nato defense spending. In the original video, Trudeau is heard joking to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron, \u201cHe was late because he takes a 40-minute press conference off the top.\u201d Trudeau doesn\u2019t explicitly say Trump\u2019s name, but it seemed to be a clear reference to the US president, given his multiple press conferences yesterday. Good morning, live blog readers! We are about an hour away from the next public hearing in the impeachment inquiry, the first to be held by the House judiciary committee. The hearing will feature testimony from a panel of legal experts on the constitutional standard for impeaching a president. There is almost 0% chance of any major bombshells coming out of this hearing, unlike last month\u2019s hearings conducted by the House intelligence committee. These witnesses will not be providing new details about the Ukraine controversy, instead offering insight into whether the president\u2019s actions (as described at last month\u2019s hearings) would justify impeachment. But according to the opening statements released this morning, the witnesses do not intend to hold back. \u201cThe president\u2019s serious misconduct, including bribery, soliciting a personal favor from a foreign leader in exchange for his exercise of power, and obstructing justice and Congress are worse than the misconduct of any prior president, including what previous presidents who faced impeachment have done or been accused of doing,\u201d Michael Gerhardt, a University of North Carolina law professor, intends to say. However, Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University who was called to testify by House Republicans, will argue the allegations against Trump do not meet the Founders\u2019 standard for impeachment and could set a dangerous precedent for the future. These clashing viewpoints -- combined with the combative messaging strategy being pursued by the president\u2019s allies -- could add some fireworks to this morning\u2019s technical legal debate. Here\u2019s what else the blog is keeping an eye on: Trump is still at the Nato summit in London and is scheduled to hold a news conference at 10:30 a.m. ET. The Atlantic Council think tank will hold a discussion on \u201cUS Strategic Interests in Ukraine\u201d with lawmakers at the Capitol. Elizabeth Warren will appear on \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d with Jimmy Fallon. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned.",

In an interview with the BBC that\u2019s due to be aired in about an hour, she has said the party was wrong to have backed some of the reforms.</p> \n  <p>The Lib Dems now propose to scrap the bedroom tax.

And I\u2019m sorry about that, and it was one of the things that we did get wrong.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked a similar question about the benefits cap, she said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I will have done as someone in collective responsibility in government.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And asked another similar question on health reforms that allow NHS contracts to be put out to private tender, she responded:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I was in government, so I will have voted for them.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Given those facts, Neil asked, why would people believe her when she says she wants to roll back those policies? Swinson told him:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Well, we\u2019re setting out what our plan is for the future. We did spend five years in a coalition government where clearly we didn\u2019t win every battle against the Conservatives. We fought many battles and we did win battles for more money for schools, for more money for the poorest pupils, for managing to cut tax for the lowest paid, to introduce same-sex marriage. There\u2019s many things that I\u2019m very proud of and where we made a difference.</p> \n   <p>But, of course, there were things where we didn\u2019t win those battles and I\u2019m sorry about that. But it was not a Liberal Democrat government, it was a coalition government.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Neil told her 240,000 people had their benefits cut because she went along with the bedroom tax. Would she like to apologise to them, she was asked.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Yes, I am sorry that I did that. It was not the right policy and we should have stopped it. And our manifesto, as our previous manifesto, makes clear that that should be scrapped. And we have identified the money to put into it.</p> \n   <p>And not only the bedroom tax, but scrapping the two-child limit, which was introduced by the Conservatives, which we did stop in government, but was introduced by the Conservative majority government after 2015.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked if austerity was a \u201cnecessary evil or a terrible mistake\u201d, Swinson said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Clearly, too much was cut. Clearly, not enough was raised from taxation and, certainly, the investment should have kicked in earlier in terms of more borrowing for capital investment.</p> \n   <p>Equally, we implemented pretty much what Labour\u2019s proposed spending plans were from the 2010 election. And I\u2019m not going to say that, in a financial crisis, it was going to be possible \u2013 with the deficit at the level that it was in 2010 \u2013 not to make any cuts at all.</p> \n   <p>Some cuts were necessary. But the shape of those cuts and certainly the balance between cuts and tax rises, I don\u2019t think was the right balance. I think we should have been raising more from taxation. And that\u2019s something which we argued for and, obviously, that was not one of the battles that we always won during coalition.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-04T18:53:26.967Z\">at 6.53pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5de7e7ce8f086f4ddd16a928\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/andrewsparrow\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-04T18:06:27.883Z\">6.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Afternoon summary</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Donald Trump has concluded a two-day visit to the UK without doing anything likely to jeopardise the chances of his close ally Boris Johnson winning the general election a week tomorrow. </strong>Given Trump\u2019s toxic reputation in the UK, Tory strategists had been concerned that any form of endorsement might be counter-productive. But yesterday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/03/andrew-sparrow-election-briefing-trump-trumps-campaigning\">Trump\u2019s comments about the NHS and a trade deal</a> were not unhelpful to the Conservatives and today the proceedings at the Nato summit were largely overshadowed by a puerile row about whether Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, Emmanuel Macron, the French president, Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, were laughing at Trump behind his back at a reception last night. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/dec/04/general-election-tories-juggle-trump-nato-and-campaigning-live?page=with:block-5de7c3118f08c347d7ee96d2#block-5de7c3118f08c347d7ee96d2\">Johnson denied this (implausibly) </a>and said it was nonsense to suggest that he did not take Trump seriously. But, at a news conference at the end of the summit, he was careful to distance himself from the man who once dubbed him \u201cBritain[\u2019s] Trump\u201d because the two are supposedly ideologically aligned.<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/dec/04/general-election-tories-juggle-trump-nato-and-campaigning-live?page=with:block-5de7c4d88f08c347d7ee96f2#block-5de7c4d88f08c347d7ee96f2\"> Johnson sidestepped an invitation to say anything positive about Trump personally</a>, and even avoided mentioning him by name. This might look like the start of a cooling in the relationship, but Trump understands perfectly well how elections work and, elsewhere in the press conference, there was a hint that behind the scenes the alliance is as strong as ever. That came when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/dec/04/boris-johnson-suggests-huawei-role-in-5g-might-harm-uk-security\">Johnson suggested that he might end up siding with US demands to exclude the Chinese firm Huawei from building Britain\u2019s 5G networks.</a> When Theresa May was prime minister she was reportedly planning a less Washington-friendly approach; according to a leak from the national security council, she was planning to give Huawei access to non-contentious parts of the 5G network.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/04/trump-describes-trudeau-as-two-faced-over-nato-hot-mic-video\">Trump denounced Trudeau as \u201ctwo-faced\u201d and left the summit venue earlier than expected, cancelling a planned press conference, after apparently being riled by the news that fellow leaders were having a joke at his expense last night.</a> </strong>His abrupt departure dominated the headlines, overshadowing the otherwise modest achievements of a low-key meeting held to mark Nato\u2019s 70th anniversary.

This leaked document, seen by the Guardian, sets out the next steps in that scenario</p> \n  <p>EU leaders will call on the European commission to draw up \u201ca comprehensive mandate for a future relationship with the UK immediately after its withdrawal\u201d, while calling on ministers in the general affairs council to \u201cswiftly\u201d adopt that mandate and other relevant decisions.</p> \n  <p>The commission negotiates trade deals on behalf of the EU, after the 28 member states, soon to be 27, have drawn up a mandate for talks.</p> \n  <p>\u201cNegotiations should be organised in a way that makes the best possible use of the limited time available for negotiation and ratification by the end of the transition,\u201d states the document. </p> \n  <p>That is an implicit recognition that not everything can be done in 11 months and the EU will have to prioritise, something EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/29/michel-barnier-tells-uk-ignore-eu-regulatory-standards-at-your-peril\">a recent interview.</a></p> \n  <p>Barnier has said a basic free trade agreement would be possible to negotiate in Johnson\u2019s preferred timetable of 11 months, although some EU diplomats are more sceptical.</p> \n  <p>The text also welcomes the continuing role for Barnier, who has won plaudits in Brussels for his coolness and diligence in keeping everyone informed. It says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The negotiations will continue to take place in a coherent manner and in a spirit of unity and transparency with all member states.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>That statement could be seen as a warning shot to the commission\u2019s trade department not to try and run the British talks in secret, as well as assurance to small member states that their voices will be heard</p> \n  <p>The text also states:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The European council reconfirms its desire to establish as close as possible a future relationship with the UK in line with the political declaration and respecting the previously agreed European council\u2019s guidelines, as well as statements and declarations.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The reference to \u201cstatements and declarations\u201d is important: it is a message to EU member states that agreements on tricky issues, such as Gibraltar, will be carried over into the next phase on Brexit. In other words, the EU does not have to reopen these arguments again.</p> \n  <p>The leaked document should be read as the EU getting its house in order to avoid any procedural snarl-ups in Brussels, thus avoiding blame if talks fail. </p> \n  <p>Missing from the document is any mention of no-deal (the EU thinks this is less likely and that its plans are in order) or a renegotiation. If Jeremy Corbyn confounded expectations and moved into 10 Downing Street, the EU would once again open talks, but would await first a request for a Brexit extension.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5de7e5e98f086f4ddd16a8fd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-04T17:03:43.507Z\">5.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Some of <strong>Boris Johnson</strong>\u2019s campaign visits seem designed entirely to construct visual metaphors for TV reporters.

Tories assume that Corbyn will always on the royal family agenda (not singing the national anthem damaged him badly), but on this occasion Corbyn said the monarchy needed improvement, and the audience applauded. Johnson said it was beyond reproach, and his reply was met with stony silence. Corbyn gave the right answer - so much so that Johnson resorted a few days later to claiming that, when he had been asked about the monarchy, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/29/general-election-tories-threaten-channel-4-after-climate-debate-ice-stunt-live-news?page=with:block-5de106ec8f08dcf251b4b68f#block-5de106ec8f08dcf251b4b68f\">he had actually been speaking about the monarch (ie, the Queen).</a></p> \n  <p>But today Corbyn hasn\u2019t had such a good outing on royal family territory.

Which would be better for their campaign, is essentially the question. Fighting it out with Johnson or extracting a promise from an incoming PM Corbyn? Chris, Renfrewshire</em></p> \n  <p>In the election campaign so far, the SNP has been careful not to entertain any \u201cplan B\u201d talk, should either Labour or Tories refuse to grant the s30 order that Holyrood requires to legally hold a second independence referendum. You may recall that an attempt to debate a plan B was swiftly quashed at SNP conference in October, and Sturgeon herself has insisted that a second indyref must meet the \u201cgold standard\u201d internationally.</p> \n  <p>Instead, SNP politicians throw the question back to the other parties: who are you to deny the democratic will of the Scottish people? It will depend on next week\u2019s results how powerful that argument is going to be: Sturgeon has described SNP successes at the ballot box as \u201can instruction to Westminster\u201d. </p> \n  <p>It\u2019s certainly clear already that Labour don\u2019t want to be seen as anti-democratic, so they are willing to entertain a pro-independence mandate at the next Holyrood elections in 2021 as reason to grant a s30 order. But Johnson has said that he\u2019ll refuse under any circumstances. I think both are good for the campaign now, since they both refuse to grant it next year, which is what Sturgeon says she wants, so it fits well with the narrative of Westminster frustrating Scottish democracy.</p> \n  <p><strong>Thanks for all your questions today </strong></p> \n  <p>Next up will be Guardian political correspondent, Kate Proctor.

If you\u2019d like to ask a question in the comments please @Libby or <a href=\"https://guardiannewsandmedia.formstack.com/forms/ask_us_a_question_snp\">via our form</a>. </p> \n  <p><em>Q: Why has reformation of the Gender Recognition Act, present in the 2017 manifesto, been removed in the 2019 manifesto? Is there any explanation or reassurance for trans and non-binary people in Scotland who are alarmed by the signal that this withdrawal sends? Will the results of the publicly funded consultation carried out to gather information for the planned reformation be made available to the taxpayer? Sophie, 29, Edinburgh, software developer</em></p> \n  <p>Thanks Sophie, a number of people raised this concern after the manifesto was published, and the Scottish government\u2019s equalities minister Shirley-Anne Somerville sought to reassure them, pointing out that she would be publishing a draft bill following further consultation by the end of the year. But it\u2019s certainly true that this issue has caused a great deal of controversy within the party, with Sturgeon facing a significant amount of push-back on her plans to proceed with a devolved gender recognition act, aimed at streamlining the process by which a transgender person gets legal recognition. The fact that the issue has gone out for consultation twice has alarmed many in the LGBTI community, who saw this as a roll-back from a more solid earlier commitment. But the strength of feeling around the proposals, and the concerns from many women within the party who feel that the impact on equalities legislation and on women-only spaces in particular has not been taken into account , meant that the SG had little option. </p> \n  <p><em>Q: This election my vote will go to a party that will legalise cannabis. What is the SNP policy on this? Gavin, Dumfriesshire</em></p> \n  <p>Worth noting first of all that drugs laws are reserved to Westminster. Nicola Sturgeon has said that devolution of drug laws is one her key demands should another party seek SNP support for their minority government after the election and the SNP\u2019s manifesto calls for this and - pending devolution - that the UK government should introduce a supervised drug consumption facility in Glasgow. Delegates at the SNP\u2019s autumn conference in Aberdeen in October also backed the decriminalisation of controlled drugs, branding the Misuse Of Drugs Act, which dates back to 1971, as \u201cnot fit for purpose\u201d. As you\u2019ll probably know, Scotland is dealing with unprecedented numbers of drug related deaths, and this resolution was linked to attempts to open a safe drugs consumption room in Glasgow, which has so far been blocked by the home office.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: What is SNP stand on more support for veterans in Scotland? Anonymous, disabled veteran from service in the Gulf War, Dunfermline</em></p> \n  <p> I know that the next Scottish census will include a question about veteran status, a significant change prompted by the British Legion\u2019s campaigning to make it easier to identify and support veterans. I believe that the SNP government was the first UK administration to make this change and also the first to appoint a Veterans\u2019 Commissioner in the autumn of 2018. Practically, there\u2019s support for getting into employment and also for veterans requiring social care, the Scottish Government has exempted the War Disablement Pension from assessment of income \u2013 meaning that veterans get the help they need and keep the full value of this pension.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5de7a9488f080aa4db53b3b8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/libbybrooks\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-04T13:05:40.757Z\">1.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><em>Q: How would a border work between independent-but-in-EU Scotland and out-of-EU England. Would it be a hard border, like the feared one in Scotland? Jack, 29, works in insurance, St Albans</em></p> \n  <p>That\u2019s going to be one of the looming questions should there be a second independence referendum campaign, and I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t give you as much clarity as I\u2019d like at this stage. In 2014, the yes campaign was able to argue that there would be no border between a newly independent Scotland and the rest of the UK because both would remain within the EU. Not so now of course. On The Andrew Marr Show recently, Sturgeon refused to rule out a hard border, saying: \u201cWe need to see how things play out and what the final relationship between the UK and the EU will be,\u201d and adding that Boris Johnson\u2019s hard Brexit was not an inevitability. </p> \n  <p>\u201cAs that picture clarifies, I will be honest with the people of Scotland but that opens a situation where Scotland\u2019s best interests depend on being independent and in charge of our own future and I don\u2019t want borders.\u201d </p> \n  <p><em>Q: How far into nationalism is the SNP prepared to go? We\u2019ve seen the effects of nationalism in Italy, amongst the far-right in Germany and with the EDL in England as well as with Trump in North America, for but a few examples. Do you consider it a potentially dangerous path to travel? Tim Eslip, middle-aged professional, England</em><br></p> \n  <p>The SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, was questioned on precisely this at the Edinburgh Fringe festival this August, so I think it\u2019s helpful to reproduce her answers at length, since it was the most comprehensive I\u2019ve heard her on this in a while. Asked about the types of nationalism you refer to, she told the audience during an interview with Matt Forde that the \u201ccivic nationalism\u201d of the SNP was \u201con another spectrum altogether\u201d from \u201cfar right, racist, insular movements\u201d seen in other parts of the world. </p> \n  <p>Asked by comedian Matt Forde about Scottish nationalism, Sturgeon said: \u201cA lot of the regimes called nationalist today are not countries striving to be independent, because often they already are, but are based on some kind of racial exceptionalism, or superiority often very illiberal and oppressive of minorities, and Scottish independence is not just at the other end of the spectrum of that, but on another spectrum altogether</p> \n  <p>Questioned specifically about a protester who had been pictured on the Royal Mile with an \u201cEngland get out of Scotland\u201d banner, Sturgeon said: \u201cThe person with that banner does not speak for the SNP.

Richard, Australia</em></p> \n  <p>Thanks Richard - that\u2019s precisely the question that the Institute for Fiscal Studies, which published an analysis of the SNP\u2019s manifesto spending pledges in the Scotsman this morning, asked. As others have noted, the SNP manifesto was notably slim on costings, and associate director of the IFS David Phillips suggests that this may be because the spending plans would necessitate more, not less, austerity for Scotland if it were to become independent. As I set out in an earlier post on this live blog, Phillips points out that pledges including increasing NHS spending across the UK by \u00a3136 per head to close the gap with Scotland, an end to the two-child benefit cap and an increased national living wage, would require significant outlay at a time when an independent Scotland was also starting out with a serious budget deficit.</p> \n  <p>Phillips adds: \u201cPursuing the types of policies suggested in the SNP manifesto in an independent Scotland would mean either those cuts would have to be even bigger, or other taxes would have to be increased to pay for the proposed net giveaways ... in the short-term at least, independence would likely necessitate more not less austerity.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The SNP\u2019s own growth commission report on the economics of independence, which came out in 2018, proposed that the inherited deficit be cut by growing the economy rather than cutting spending. It also said it should delay launching its own currency and introduce tax cuts for migrants. Analysing the report at the time, the IFS commended it for being honest about \u201cthe challenging public finance position an independent Scotland would start life with\u201d.</p> \n  <p>However, it went on to dispute claims that its economic strategy would end austerity, suggesting it in fact implied cuts in spending and benefits equal to 4% of GDP over a 10-year period. </p> \n  <p>Questioned about Scotland\u2019s notional deficit by Andrew Neil last week, which stands at 7% according to current figures, and whether it could hinder renewed membership of the EU (EU members\u2019 budget deficits must not exceed 3% of GDP) Nicola Sturgeon argued: \u201cOur task is to get our deficit reducing faster. That is principally through growing our economy faster which remaining in the EU or returning to the EU helps us to do.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-04T13:35:41.556Z\">at 1.35pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5de7aafe8f08b5a1928d94a8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-04T12:52:08.479Z\">12.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>My colleague <strong>Richard Partington</strong> has been factchecking the John McDonnell claim that a Labour government would save families an average of \u00a36,700 a year.</p> \n  <p>Here is his verdict.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Nationalisation could save households money that would otherwise go to private investors, but is reliant on the smooth execution of Labour\u2019s plan.

What would the cost of setting up the structure of an independent Scotland be and where will the newly independent Scotland get the money? Robert, 68, retired, Edinburgh</em><br></p> \n  <p>Hi Robert, you\u2019ll recall this was a much-disputed area during the 2014 campaign. A Treasury report in May of that year estimated the costs of setting up an independent state to be around \u00a31.5bn - including \u00a3750m to create a new tax regime and \u00a3400m for computers and IT for welfare - but this was vigorously challenged by the then first minister, Alex Salmond. Prof Patrick Dunleavy of LSE was quoted by both the UK and Scottish governments as the leading expert on transition costs, and he suggested that \u201cstart-up costs\u201d would come in at around \u00a3200m but then a further \u00a3900m would be required for tax and welfare infrastructure. Nicola Sturgeon confirmed in September this year that she had instructed civil servants to work on a second white paper to convince voters of the case for independence, although it should be noted that the original version relied heavily on projected oil revenues which have since plummeted.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Would an independent Scotland find it easier to join Efta rather than the EU, which would give an independent Scotland many of the benefits which eg. Norway has, but also allow us to opt out of CFP and the CAP? </em><br></p> \n  <p> While the SNP has explored the possibility of rejoining the single market via the European Free Trade Association, with the option of returning to full EU membership later, the response from other member states is mixed. In 2017, Iceland\u2019s foreign minister warned that Scotland could not apply to join Efta until after it had fully separated from the UK, but in the same year Norway said it would keep an open mind to Scottish membership. </p> \n  <p> Accession to Efta is seen as more straightforward than rejoining the EU, but it is not certain that Scotland would then be allowed into the European Economic Area, membership of which would still have to be agreed by the EU. New members of Efta must be accepted unanimously by the existing four members: Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland. </p> \n  <p>Since the Brexit vote, there have been some encouraging noises from EU officials that an independent Scotland could automatically join the EU or inherit the UK\u2019s membership after it leaves. But in 2017, Jacqueline Minor, the European commission\u2019s head of representation in the UK, warned that Scotland would need to formally apply after leaving the UK, although it could be fast-tracked because it already complies with EU rules and regulations.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-04T13:03:59.944Z\">at 1.03pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5de7a0ad8f08b5a1928d9403\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-04T12:39:21.768Z\">12.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">John McDonnell's speech and Q&amp;A - Summary</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n   <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"072a8ef4-44da-4a50-8d09-c8c9d253754e\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n    <div>\n     <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uDxZ9t9USwE?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n   </gu-atom> \n  </figure> \n  <p>With the possible exception of Nicola Sturgeon, <strong>John McDonnell</strong> is probably the stand-out media performer of this campaign.

This wasn\u2019t the most newsy speech of the campaign, and it will be overshadowed by events at that Nato conference later, but he conveyed a positive message and he took quite a large number of critical questions without tripping up. Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>McDonnell refused to accept Donald Trump\u2019s claims that the NHS would not be on the table in trade talks, saying the US president had a \u201cpassing relationship with reality and truth\u201d.</strong> Asked if he thought Trump was lying when he said this yesterday, McDonnell all but said yes. He replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>All the evidence that we\u2019ve seen has demonstrated objectively that it is.</p> \n   <p>Donald Trump has a passing relationship with reality and truth sometimes. I believe in one instance claimed he didn\u2019t know what the initials NHS stood for, so the reality is the evidence is there and the anxiety that we have about the NHS under Boris Johnson regime and his relationship with trump causes us extreme concern.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He joked about a Corbyn government having difficult relations with Trump. </strong>Asked to respond to what Trump said yesterday about being able to work with Corbyn if he became PM, McDonnell said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It\u2019s encouraging to know that we can maintain a good working relationship with the people of America in the future - [McDonnell paused] after possibly another election.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The line about the election prompted laughter from the audience. McDonnell then went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Obviously, Jeremy will work with leaders all over the world including Donald Trump and we will ensure that whatever happens in the future we will look after the interests of our own people as well as other across the globe.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>McDonnell said Labour would announce details of its \u201cfirst 100 days\u201d programme before polling day. </strong>(See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/dec/04/general-election-tories-juggle-trump-nato-and-campaigning-live?page=with:block-5de79a678f08f78465b4ab8b#block-5de79a678f08f78465b4ab8b\">11.40am.)</a></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He described compensating the Waspi (Women Against State Pensions Inequality) women as being akin to bailing out the banks.</strong> (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/dec/04/general-election-tories-juggle-trump-nato-and-campaigning-live?page=with:block-5de79d048f08fe0afc2ac7f3#block-5de79d048f08fe0afc2ac7f3\">11.52am.)</a></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He suggested the extent of poverty in the UK was incompatible with the values of Christianity.</strong> In his speech he said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>On Tuesday a new Shelter report also found 135,000 children will be without a home this Christmas.</p> \n   <p>On the same day an analysis by the Equality Trust showed the UK\u2019s six richest people control as much wealth as the poorest 13 million.

As she has not narrowed the attainment gap why should parents and children give her more than an F? Iain RF MacIain, 45, working in education, Scottish Borders</em></p> \n  <p>Interesting you mention that today \u2013 you no doubt saw the latest Pisa report yesterday, which saw Scotland achieve its lowest scores in maths and science since it first took part in the survey almost 20 years ago, and reported that pupils\u2019 performance in reading tests had recovered only to the level it was at in 2012. A professor of education at Edinburgh University, Lindsay Paterson, described children\u2019s reading performance as \u201cstagnating around mediocrity\u201d, arguing that the reason the attainment gap on reading had narrowed was because middle-class kids were getting worse. The education secretary, John Swinney, described the results as \u201cvery encouraging\u201d, while accepting there were still challenges. The problem is that this is just one element of the overall picture, as you\u2019ll know if you work in education yourself. </p> \n  <p>Another serious concern is teacher shortages. In rural Scotland we have some of the most severe shortages in Europe; also the numbers of days lost to stress-related illness for teachers who are in post; and worries about availability of subjects to children taking high school exams, with reports of kids travelling for hours each week to access teaching in their chosen subject which is only available in another school in their council area.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> \n  <p><em>Q: Why don\u2019t the SNP stand candidates in England or Wales?

It\u2019s fair to say that STV\u2019s debate between the Scottish party leaders \u2013 excluding Patrick Harvie of the Scottish Greens, bizarrely \u2013 was rather a shout-fest, although it was refreshing to see <strong>Nicola Sturgeon</strong> properly interrogated on Holyrood policy, which seldom happens when she takes part in the UK-wide debates. But of course that\u2019s because education, health and so on are devolved \u2013 so while it was good to see those areas covered, they are not technically relevant to a UK general election. </p> \n  <p>The format, which really felt its lack of a live audience, involved a series of questions and interrogations of each leader by the other politicians, rather than by the host, Colin Mackay, and so lent itself to people (men, Sturgeon was the only woman there) talking across one another.</p> \n  <p>At one point I looked up from my notes to see the Scottish Conservatives\u2019 <strong>Jackson Carlaw</strong> shouting at the Lib Dems\u2019 <strong>Willie Rennie</strong>, Rennie shouting at Labour\u2019s <strong>Richard Leonard</strong>, and Sturgeon standing there with her arms folded like a teacher who has already tried multiple timeouts with the kids and is now just waiting for the lunch bell to go.</p> \n  <p>Some interesting points: Tory leader Carlaw urged viewers to \u201clend us your vote to stop indyref2\u201d \u2013 clearly the anti-independence message is working as well for the Scottish Tories, if not better than getting Brexit done. Challenged on Boris Johnson\u2019s previous remarks about Muslim women and gay men, he admitted they were \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d, but insisted he would judge him on his performance in office. Carlaw and Rennie attacked Labour\u2019s \u201cclear as mud\u201d position on Brexit, mocking Leonard for being \u201cconstantly overruled\u201d by Jeremy Corbyn. Leonard struggled to answer the charge that voters didn\u2019t trust Corbyn to stand up for the union.</p> \n  <p>Sturgeon failed to offer a plan B if a new Tory (or Labour) government refused her demand for the powers to hold a second independence referendum next year. Challenged on putting independence before public services, her defence of the latest Pisa report, which saw Scotland achieve its lowest scores in maths and science since it first took part in the survey almost 20 years ago and reported that pupils\u2019 performance in reading tests had recovered only to the level it was at in 2012, was weak. But at least it prompted the zingiest response of the debate from Rennie: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If you are telling me that a line on a chart going down is optimistic, then the problem of numeracy in your government goes right to the top.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"38d1cd01290ce7d0daff8ce355c4ab5e5562c0fa\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38d1cd01290ce7d0daff8ce355c4ab5e5562c0fa/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"From left to right: Scottish Labour party leader Richard Leonard, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, STV\u2019s Colin Mackay, Scottish Conservatives leader Jackson Carlaw and Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie, ahead of the the first Scottish TV election debate last night.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From left to right: the Scottish Labour leader, Richard Leonard, the SNP first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, STV\u2019s Colin Mackay, the Scottish Conservative leader, Jackson Carlaw, and the Scottish Lib Dem leader, Willie Rennie.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Devlin/STV/PA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-04T10:14:50.014Z\">at 10.14am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5de77e188f08bf648cb2389f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-04T09:38:09.868Z\">9.38am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Boris Johnson, or whoever controls his Twitter account, has just posted a picture of the PM meeting a blonde-haired admirer yesterday.

Five years ago \u2013 as a backbencher \u2013 he was speaking at an anti-Nato conference. Now, the Labour party he leads is campaigning on a manifesto promise to maintain the UK\u2019s commitment to Nato.</p> \n  <p>Responding to suggestions that Corbyn was ambivalent over Nato, which many consider a cornerstone of the UK\u2019s national defence, Gardiner retorted: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The way you defend this country is to make sure that you don\u2019t go on foreign wars and don\u2019t start bombing before you have started thinking.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Ouch! Gardiner was challenged: Is that what Nato does? He continued:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Consistently, if you look at the Iraq war, who was on the right side of history on that? Jeremy Corbyn was not the president at the time and indeed not the Labour party at the time under Tony Blair. But all of parliament went into that, Jeremy Corbyn did not. </p> \n   <p>What I\u2019m saying is that if you look at the way in which we want to use a defensive alliance it is to think carefully through positions, to learn the lessons of the Chilcot report, learn about how we should try and prevent conflict and de-escalate a situation, rather than actually then promoting a conflict. </p> \n   <p>When we went into Libya, when we joined the bombing raid on Libya, we were told it was absolutely essential to do that. I didn\u2019t vote for that, neither did Jeremy Corbyn. That has proved to be a disaster. It\u2019s proved to allow groups like Isis to form and take control and to make that country a complete basket case.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d500588ebd6f57b54f1d99421cbd4694c39a2ab7\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d500588ebd6f57b54f1d99421cbd4694c39a2ab7/630_0_2825_1695/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barry Gardiner (left) with Jeremy Corbyn.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barry Gardiner (left) with Jeremy Corbyn.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Veysey/REX/Shutterstock</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-04T09:03:51.865Z\">at 9.03am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5de763b98f0829bc521b6299\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-04T07:46:26.430Z\">7.46am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Speaking on Today this morning, <strong>Jeremy Hunt</strong> denied any knowledge of talks between the UK and the US on NHS drugs pricing, despite documents unearthed recently showing that officials began negotiations during his tenure as health secretary.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWhen I was health secretary, I wasn\u2019t aware of any talks going on with the United States at all,\u201d said Hunt, who left his post as foreign secretary when Boris Johnson became prime minister.<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In so far as there have been preliminary discussions between officials on both sides, not between politicians, we have made absolutely clear that NHS drugs prices are not on the table.</p> \n   <p>I\u2019m afraid this is the traditional scare story.

We\u2019re a little more than a week out from the election and there\u2019s a lot going on today, so strap in.</p> \n  <p>Donald Trump\u2019s presence in the UK for Nato talks continues to loom over the election. The summit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/03/macron-clashes-with-erdogan-over-anti-isis-kurdish-fighters\">started with heated exchanges</a> and further tensions are expected as leaders meet again today. Donald Trump is seen as an electoral liability for the Conservatives over fears that he may be interested in putting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/03/nhs-medics-reject-ideology-of-trump-in-rally-against-visit\">the NHS on the table in US-UK trade talks</a> \u2013 though yesterday the president categorically denied the US was interested in the health service.<strong tabindex=\"-1\"> </strong>Boris Johnson has so far managed to keep his distance from Trump, with <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/03/smug-in-the-west-but-even-the-tories-steer-clear-of-trump-at-nato\">Marina Hyde writing</a> that Johnson will continue to studiously avoid the president because \u201cTories sense even a handshake with Trump could piss their electoral bed\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/03/labour-plan-to-tackle-rip-off-britain-would-save-families-6700\">Labour will today try to convince voters of the financial benefit</a> of electing a Corbyn government. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, will say his party\u2019s policies would save families an average of \u00a36,700 a year by \u201cputting a stop to rip-off Britain\u201d as Labour narrows its focus to bread-and-butter issues.</p> \n  <p>In a dossier to be published alongside the speech, McDonnell will claim that policies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/01/labour-plan-cut-rail-fares-england-season-tickets\">including nationalising utilities and reducing the cost of rail season tickets</a> \u2013 as well as free childcare for all two- to four-year-olds, free prescription charges and free school meals \u2013 will help the hip pocket of average households.</p> \n  <p>However, Labour candidates are privately concerned about the scattergun nature of the giveaways, with one Labour saying the manifesto, while good, is \u201cjust long and confusing\u201d and some promises could appear too good to be true.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-04T08:55:38.290Z\">at 8.55am GMT</time></p> \n</div>",

          "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from us this evening. Thanks for reading and commenting. My colleagues, Patrick Wintour and Rowena Mason, have tonight\u2019s main story: And Andrew Sparrow has put together a detailed summary of the day\u2019s main events: Since he did so, the Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson apologised for her part in introducing austerity after the 2010 election. Swinson said some cuts were necessary but the nature and severity of those implemented by the government of which she was a part were wrong. Commenting on his interview with Johnson, Labour\u2019s Barry Gardiner said to Peston: Quite honestly, if I wanted to see two men shouting at each other without listening I\u2019d go down to the local pub. All he did was bully, hector, and ignore the questions that you put to him. And that is the nature of this man who\u2019s putting himself forward to be elected as our prime minister. As a prime minister, what I want to see somebody who\u2019s prepared to take on the hard questions and actually try and give you a serious answer to them. He didn\u2019t do that with you. He certainly didn\u2019t do it with Marr on Sunday, and he\u2019s refused to do it with Andrew Neil. The guy\u2019s running scared of any genuine sort of scrutiny that we could give to him. On the prime minister being questioned about Brexit, Gardiner said: You challenged him, you challenged him on how he was going to get it done. He didn\u2019t have an answer, he just kept on repeating the slogan. Asked about reports he forced Tory MPs to sign up to his withdrawal agreement deal, Johnson said: \u201cI have not forced them, that is totally unfair, there was absolutely no lobotomy\u201d He insisted \u201cno, not at all\u201d when asked by ITV\u2019s Robert Peston whether he had said they \u201ccouldn\u2019t be candidates?\u201d Boris Johnson, in his interview with ITV, has insisted the UK \u201cwill be out\u201d of the EU on 31 January, while simultaneously acknowledging that the country will actually enter the transition period \u2013 during which it will still be subject to the EU\u2019s rules and regulations. Johnson said the UK would legally have left the EU on 31 January and said it could end the transition period at any point it chose to thereafter. Last month, the Brexit experts Anand Menon and Catherine Barnard wrote an interesting opinion piece for the Guardian on what this might all mean in reality: Wrapping up the interview, Swinson indicated she believed she would be able to stay on as Lib Dem leader, even if the party secured fewer seats than it held in the last Parliament. I\u2019m staying as Liberal Democrat Leader and I\u2019m excited ... about the movement, the Liberal movement that we need to build because we still need to make sure that we can stop Brexit and there is something bigger at stake here as well ... It is about who we are as a country. Whether we are open, whether we are inclusive, whether we go down the route that you see in America of populism and nationalism and it\u2019s liberalism that is the answer to that and that is the Liberal movement that I\u2019m building. Pressed on whether she would stand down following poor results, she added: I\u2019ve got a job to do and I\u2019ve just been elected to do it and I\u2019m excited to be fighting this election and in terms of that wider movement - you know we have more Liberal Democrat members than ever before ... I\u2019m absolutely here to stay. Swinson declined to say whether she would begin campaigning for the UK to rejoin the EU immediately after Brexit. Asked if the country should join the Euro if it were deemed necessary to demonstrate commitment to \u201cbeing at the heart of the European Union\u201d, she added: I don\u2019t think we should be joining the Euro. You know, I think being at the heart of the European Union I do not interpret in the way that you have just described it. I think that\u2019s about us playing a leadership role within the EU. We\u2019ve done that on so many occasions. If you look at the climate talks, the Paris Accord, the UK played a leadership role getting the EU to adopt an ambitious position \u2013 and then the EU managed to get the world to adopt an ambitious position on the climate emergency. That\u2019s the kind of thing about being at the heart of the EU. Swinson confirmed she would want to extend voting in any second Brexit referendum to 16- and 17-year-olds. Asked if she would go ahead with it even if it meant delaying the referendum, she said: Well, I think it\u2019s possible, in discussions that I\u2019ve had about how we could do this swiftly. So for example it would be possible to pass a law to extend the franchise to 16-year-olds. It\u2019s easier with EU citizens because they\u2019re already on the voters roll. Asked whether she would sacrifice a second Brexit referendum if the price of securing one was a second Scottish independence referendum, Swinson said: I will vote for a people\u2019s vote on the Brexit deal and I think SNP members of parliament will also vote for that legislation because they will know that, you know, that\u2019s what people in Scotland want. Swinson insisted again that she would not \u201cput Jeremy Corbyn in No 10\u201d but she said she would vote with him \u2013 or any other government \u2013 to secure a second Brexit referendum. I will vote for legislation to pass a people\u2019s vote, of course I will and I would have done that under the previous Conservative government, just as I would do under any other government. But I will work with people on a cross-party basis. If we can elect enough MPs who support a people\u2019s vote and we have the chance of delivering it, Liberal Democrat MPs are the strongest advocates of remain. But I\u2019m not going to put Jeremy Corbyn in No 10. But, if a government of any colour puts down a bill in parliament to have a people\u2019s vote, then we will support having a people\u2019s vote to put a specific Brexit deal to the people with the option of remaining in the EU. Asked about her personal approval rating, which Neil said was \u201ceven lower than Nigel Farage\u201d at minus 31 \u2013 down from minus 20 at the start of the campaign \u2013 she said: At the end of the day, I\u2019m going to stand for what I believe in and there will be people who dislike that, but I\u2019m not going to ... just have a kind of message that\u2019s full of... I mean, you know, Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s not saying where he stands on Brexit and I\u2019m proud to be able to be clear that I think our best future is in the European Union. In a reference to her election campaign tactics, Swinson was asked if she would now acknowledge she will not be the next prime minister. She said: Well, I would obviously love to be prime minister. Clearly, when you look at the polls that\u2019s not the most likely scenario. I will certainly grant you that. But I\u2019m, you know, very glad to be standing up for the millions of people in this country who want to remain in the European Union and the more Liberal Democrat MPs we elect, the more likely we are to be able to stop Brexit. The BBC\u2019s interview with the Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, has started. She has been defending her personal popularity ratings and her tactics in the election campaign; particularly her decision to insist on reversing Brexit unilaterally. The prime minister has claimed people will stop talking about Brexit after the extension period ends on 31 January 2020, despite the fact the UK would then enter the transition period and no future trade deal is in place to come into force at that point. Asked whether such could happen by ITV News in an interview due to air on Tuesday evening, Boris Johnson said: Yes, and now let me say something: I think we will have got Brexit done and you will find that it moves, because what will happen is that the parliamentary agony will be over, and the political agony will be over, and the misery and tedium and procrastination that\u2019s been going on\u2026 will be over. The interview, Robert Peston, interjected to tell Johnson that his claim was untrue. Earlier, we reported that the EU had drawn up plans for how Brexit talks might run if the Tories win the election (see: 5:47pm). The Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, has apologised for her part in introducing swingeing cuts when she was part of the Tory-led coalition government. In an interview with the BBC that\u2019s due to be aired in about an hour, she has said the party was wrong to have backed some of the reforms. The Lib Dems now propose to scrap the bedroom tax. Asked by Andrew Neil who had voted for its introduction nine times, Swinson replied: The Liberal Democrats in government, including myself, which I have previously said \u2013 and I\u2019m happy to say again \u2013 was wrong. And I\u2019m sorry about that, and it was one of the things that we did get wrong. Asked a similar question about the benefits cap, she said: I will have done as someone in collective responsibility in government. And asked another similar question on health reforms that allow NHS contracts to be put out to private tender, she responded: I was in government, so I will have voted for them. Given those facts, Neil asked, why would people believe her when she says she wants to roll back those policies? Swinson told him: Well, we\u2019re setting out what our plan is for the future. We did spend five years in a coalition government where clearly we didn\u2019t win every battle against the Conservatives. We fought many battles and we did win battles for more money for schools, for more money for the poorest pupils, for managing to cut tax for the lowest paid, to introduce same-sex marriage. There\u2019s many things that I\u2019m very proud of and where we made a difference. But, of course, there were things where we didn\u2019t win those battles and I\u2019m sorry about that. But it was not a Liberal Democrat government, it was a coalition government. Neil told her 240,000 people had their benefits cut because she went along with the bedroom tax. Would she like to apologise to them, she was asked. Yes, I am sorry that I did that. It was not the right policy and we should have stopped it. And our manifesto, as our previous manifesto, makes clear that that should be scrapped. And we have identified the money to put into it. And not only the bedroom tax, but scrapping the two-child limit, which was introduced by the Conservatives, which we did stop in government, but was introduced by the Conservative majority government after 2015. Asked if austerity was a \u201cnecessary evil or a terrible mistake\u201d, Swinson said: Clearly, too much was cut. Clearly, not enough was raised from taxation and, certainly, the investment should have kicked in earlier in terms of more borrowing for capital investment. Equally, we implemented pretty much what Labour\u2019s proposed spending plans were from the 2010 election. And I\u2019m not going to say that, in a financial crisis, it was going to be possible \u2013 with the deficit at the level that it was in 2010 \u2013 not to make any cuts at all. Some cuts were necessary. But the shape of those cuts and certainly the balance between cuts and tax rises, I don\u2019t think was the right balance. I think we should have been raising more from taxation. And that\u2019s something which we argued for and, obviously, that was not one of the battles that we always won during coalition. Donald Trump has concluded a two-day visit to the UK without doing anything likely to jeopardise the chances of his close ally Boris Johnson winning the general election a week tomorrow. Given Trump\u2019s toxic reputation in the UK, Tory strategists had been concerned that any form of endorsement might be counter-productive. But yesterday Trump\u2019s comments about the NHS and a trade deal were not unhelpful to the Conservatives and today the proceedings at the Nato summit were largely overshadowed by a puerile row about whether Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, Emmanuel Macron, the French president, Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, were laughing at Trump behind his back at a reception last night. Johnson denied this (implausibly) and said it was nonsense to suggest that he did not take Trump seriously. But, at a news conference at the end of the summit, he was careful to distance himself from the man who once dubbed him \u201cBritain[\u2019s] Trump\u201d because the two are supposedly ideologically aligned. Johnson sidestepped an invitation to say anything positive about Trump personally, and even avoided mentioning him by name. This might look like the start of a cooling in the relationship, but Trump understands perfectly well how elections work and, elsewhere in the press conference, there was a hint that behind the scenes the alliance is as strong as ever. That came when Johnson suggested that he might end up siding with US demands to exclude the Chinese firm Huawei from building Britain\u2019s 5G networks. When Theresa May was prime minister she was reportedly planning a less Washington-friendly approach; according to a leak from the national security council, she was planning to give Huawei access to non-contentious parts of the 5G network. Trump denounced Trudeau as \u201ctwo-faced\u201d and left the summit venue earlier than expected, cancelling a planned press conference, after apparently being riled by the news that fellow leaders were having a joke at his expense last night. His abrupt departure dominated the headlines, overshadowing the otherwise modest achievements of a low-key meeting held to mark Nato\u2019s 70th anniversary. At the meeting Turkey dropped its opposition to a plan to bolster the defences of Baltic states and Poland against Russia. As my colleague Patrick Wintour reports, Nato leaders also agreed to set up a committee of experts to analyse political decision-making after the French president Emmanuel Macron lamented the \u201cbrain death\u201d of the military alliance. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has said he does not accept Trump\u2019s claim that the NHS would not be on the table in trade talks, saying the US president has a \u201cpassing relationship with reality and truth\u201d. An Extinction Rebellion protester dressed as a bee glued himself to the Liberal Democrats\u2019 battlebus this morning. John Longworth, a Brexit party MEP, has had the party whip removed after a row with the leadership over election strategy. The former Labour MP Ivan Lewis, who resigned from the party last year when he was suspended over sexual harassment allegations, has urged people in his Bury South constituency to vote Tory to keep Jeremy Corbyn out of Downing Street. Black and ethnic minority voters are backing Corbyn in far higher numbers than the overall electorate as the two main political parties vie for their votes in crucial swing seats. MPs would be banned from holding second jobs under reforms of the rules governing political donations and lobbying that have been proposed by the Labour party. That is all from me for tonight. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is writing the blog now. But there is more to come tonight. Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, is being interviewed by Andrew Neil on BBC One at 7.30pm. And Johnson is being interviewed on ITV by Peston. (The programme goes out at 11.15pm, but the interview is broadcast on Twitter at 8pm.) EU leaders will call for swift action to negotiate a future relationship with the UK, according to a draft declaration likely to be agreed the day after the general election. EU leaders are holding one of their regular summits in Brussels on 11-12 December, just as British voters are going to the polls and getting the results While the EU is keen not take sides, officials read British election polls and see a Conservative Brexit on 31 January as the most likely outcome. This leaked document, seen by the Guardian, sets out the next steps in that scenario EU leaders will call on the European commission to draw up \u201ca comprehensive mandate for a future relationship with the UK immediately after its withdrawal\u201d, while calling on ministers in the general affairs council to \u201cswiftly\u201d adopt that mandate and other relevant decisions. The commission negotiates trade deals on behalf of the EU, after the 28 member states, soon to be 27, have drawn up a mandate for talks. \u201cNegotiations should be organised in a way that makes the best possible use of the limited time available for negotiation and ratification by the end of the transition,\u201d states the document. That is an implicit recognition that not everything can be done in 11 months and the EU will have to prioritise, something EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said in a recent interview. Barnier has said a basic free trade agreement would be possible to negotiate in Johnson\u2019s preferred timetable of 11 months, although some EU diplomats are more sceptical. The text also welcomes the continuing role for Barnier, who has won plaudits in Brussels for his coolness and diligence in keeping everyone informed. It says: The negotiations will continue to take place in a coherent manner and in a spirit of unity and transparency with all member states. That statement could be seen as a warning shot to the commission\u2019s trade department not to try and run the British talks in secret, as well as assurance to small member states that their voices will be heard The text also states: The European council reconfirms its desire to establish as close as possible a future relationship with the UK in line with the political declaration and respecting the previously agreed European council\u2019s guidelines, as well as statements and declarations. The reference to \u201cstatements and declarations\u201d is important: it is a message to EU member states that agreements on tricky issues, such as Gibraltar, will be carried over into the next phase on Brexit. In other words, the EU does not have to reopen these arguments again. The leaked document should be read as the EU getting its house in order to avoid any procedural snarl-ups in Brussels, thus avoiding blame if talks fail. Missing from the document is any mention of no-deal (the EU thinks this is less likely and that its plans are in order) or a renegotiation. If Jeremy Corbyn confounded expectations and moved into 10 Downing Street, the EU would once again open talks, but would await first a request for a Brexit extension. Some of Boris Johnson\u2019s campaign visits seem designed entirely to construct visual metaphors for TV reporters. That is certainly the case with his visit to Red Bull Racing in Milton Keynes. (See 4.39pm.) Just in case any reporters missed the hint, Johnson declared: This whole country is stuck in the pits because of this blocked parliament. What we need to do is change the wheel and get it back on track. This is from ITV\u2019s Paul Brand. These are from the BBC\u2019s Ross Hawkins, who has spent more time on the road than most journalists this election. The New Statesman has published its election leader article and it has said that it cannot back any of the three main parties. It does come quite close to backing the Green party, saying it would like to see more Green MPs in parliament, although it won\u2019t endorse the Greens because it says they are not in a position to govern. The New Statesman is broadly on the left and in the past it has backed Labour. But it says it cannot do so because of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership. It says: Labour has rightly chipped away at the edifice of \u2018capitalist realism\u2019, the term the late cultural theorist Mark Fisher used to describe the sense that \u2018not only is capitalism the only viable political and economic system\u2026 it is now impossible even to imagine a coherent alternative to it\u2019. But the essential judgement that must be made is on Mr Corbyn himself. His reluctance to apologise for the antisemitism in Labour and to take a stance on Brexit, the biggest issue facing the country, make him unfit to be prime minister. Before becoming Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn described Nato as \u201ca danger to world peace\u201d and said it should have been disbanded at the end of the cold war. Channel 4 News has a roundup of some of his quotes on the topic here. Today, asked what had made him change his mind and commit to the UK remaining in Nato, Corbyn replied: Our party is committed to remain a part of Nato. It\u2019s also what we do in Nato and what Nato does itself that\u2019s important \u2013 and that\u2019s why I make the point about the need for criticism of human rights abuses wherever they occur, including Russia, but also an understanding of other countries so that we do reduce those tensions and we don\u2019t recreate the tensions of the cold war. Pressed on what had personally made him change his mind, he replied: I have always been in favour of a policy of detente and lowering of tensions and we have decided we will remain in Nato as a party. Asked if he thought Nato now contributed to world peace, he replied: I think we\u2019ll have to contribute to world peace through Nato and any other alliance \u2013 principally through the United Nations. Here are the main points from Boris Johnson\u2019s press conference at the end of the Nato summit. Johnson denied laughing at President Trump at a reception last night and not taking him seriously. (See 2.36am) Johnson sidestepped an opportunity to praise Trump personally. (See 2.50pm.) In fact, it was almost a case of \u201cDonald who?\u201d as Johnson got through the whole press conference without mentioning the president once by name. Johnson claimed that Jeremy Corbyn wanted to \u201cdestroy Nato\u201d. At times he used the press conference for blatant electioneering, and he ended it with what amounted to a version of his standard election stump speech. He said: There is a choice between those who want to strengthen Nato and those in the Labour opposition who actually want to destroy it, destroy Nato, this alliance that has kept us safe. I want to strengthen MI5, that keeps us safe. Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour party want to install a home secretary who wants to disband MI5. I want longer sentences for violent criminals and to make sure that terrorists serve their full term. Mr Corbyn doesn\u2019t agree with that. In the past Corbyn did oppose Nato membership, but as Labour leader he has accepted party policy, and the majority view in the party, which is for the UK to remain a Nato member. And, although Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, signed a Commons early day motion in the 1980s opposing MI5, that is not a view that she has supported for years. Johnson said that \u201cnational security interests\u201d would be a key issue when the government decided whether to let the Chinese firm Huawei play a role in building the UK\u2019s 5G network. Asked about this, he replied: On Huawei and 5G. I don\u2019t want this country to be unnecessarily hostile to investment from overseas. On the other hand, we cannot prejudice our vital national security interests, nor can we prejudice our ability to cooperate with other Five Eyes security partners, and that we will be how \u2013 that will be the key criterion that informs our decision about Huawei. HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh took this as a hint that Huawei will be excluded from this work (a decision that would please the US, which has urged the UK not to allow the company to have a role in constructing the 5G network). Johnson also made a more general point about China posing a threat in the technology sector. Asked whether it should be seen as a strategic partner or an enemy, he replied: Well I certainly don\u2019t think the second thing [enemy]. There was no support for that idea. I think what people felt was that it was right that we should build a strategic partnership with China, but that we should be aware also of the challenges that China presents, particularly when it comes to areas of high technology. I think that would be a fairer characterisation of the discussion. Johnson implied that he was opposed to allowing Britons who fought for Islamic State to return to the country. Asked whether they should be allowed back, he replied: As you know, one of the difficulties we have in taking these people back is that our legal systems make it very difficult for us to secure convictions. And I go back to what I said earlier, people go out to break the law, to sort of fight in terrorist organisations, then they really have to take the consequences. Johnson said he was not worried about how a dossier about the UK-US trade talks was leaked. (See 2.18pm.) This is a rare example of Johnson snubbing his former employer the Daily Telegraph, which in its splash story on Monday suggested this might be part of a Russian plot. The former Labour minister Ivan Lewis, who resigned from the party last year criticising Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s handling of antisemitism, is now urging people in his constituency to vote Conservative. At the time he resigned, Lewis had been suspended from Labour over sexual harassment allegations, but he claimed the investigation was being prolonged for political reasons. Lewis is standing as an independent candidate in Bury South, where he had a majority of almost 6,000 over the Tories in 2017. But now he says people should vote for his Tory opponent because he thinks the priority is for Corbyn to lose. In a post on Facebook he said: I say to my Labour friends, Corbyn\u2019s Labour party is not the Labour party of our parents and grandparents. It is unreasonable of me to expect you all to leave the party because of antisemitism. But it is unreasonable of you to admit there is a serious antisemitism problem in the party then expect me to join you in the mantra \u2018but the most important thing is we have a Labour government\u2019. Imagine if this institutionalised racism was against any other minority community ... At this election, the future of our country is on the line like never before. The only way to stop Corbyn in Bury South is to vote Conservative. This is not a decision I have taken lightly but I believe it to be in the best interests of the constituency and the country. A cold snap is expected to hit Britain just in time for election day on 12 December, the Press Association reports. Meteorologists at the Met Office have predicted that a wintry spell will arrive for election week, covering the UK in frost and seeing temperatures plunge to sub-zero in some areas. But pollsters say voters are unlikely to be deterred from going to the polls next week, with poor weather only having \u201ca small effect on turnout\u201d. The long-term forecast suggests snowfall in Scotland and the Pennines, with the rest of the UK to be hit by blustery winds and freezing fog, PA reports. Temperatures are predicted to drop throughout the week, dipping below normal towards election day, with a greater chance of frost developing across the country. But the election would go ahead, even in a blanket of snow, because it is written in law and cannot be postponed unless the law is changed. The chair of campaign group Leave Means Leave has been axed as a Brexit party MEP over disloyalty, party officials have claimed. John Longworth, who publicly differed on general election strategy with Nigel Farage, has had the whip removed and will no longer represent the party in Brussels. Unease between Longworth and his party is understood to have stemmed from his insistence early in the election that the party operate a smaller campaign and not target Tory seats. Others wanted to contest 600-plus constituencies. The Brexit party\u2019s chief whip and MEP, Brian Monteith, said: We regret having to remove the whip, but we have been left with no alternative after John Longworth repeatedly undermined the party\u2019s Brexit strategy over the last few months. The Brexit party shall not be deflected from, or undermined in, its campaign to win Labour seats. We are receiving a great reception from disenchanted Labour voters and have believe we have a good chance of winning in many seats. Longworth spoke openly about how his then party should focus on 20 to 30 seats in Labour areas at the very start of the campaign. A few days later Farage announced it was standing down in 317 Tory-held seats, which in some areas has disappointed candidates and party supporters. Its campaign is now focused on Labour heartland areas in northern England, the Midlands and Wales and it is running 274 candidates. Here is some reaction to the Boris Johnson press conference from political journalists. From the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn From my colleague John Crace From the Telegraph\u2019s Gordon Rayner From the Independent\u2019s Benjamin Kentish From my colleague Dan Sabbagh President Trump has confirmed that he is not holding an end-of-summit press conference. Boris Johnson may have denied laughing at Donald Trump. But he was not prepared to praise him personally. This is what he said when he was asked if he thought that, \u201cas a leader and as a man that Donald Trump is good for the west and good for Britain\u201d. Johnson replied: I certainly think that the United States ... has massively contributed to Nato, has been for 70 years a pillar of stability for our collective security. If you want evidence of the willingness of the United States to stand shoulder to shoulder with us, I would point you back to what happened in the case of the poisonings in Salisbury ... And the United States actually expelled 60 [Russian diplomats]. That was a fantastic testament I think to the trans-Atlantic alliance. At this point Johnson started comparing the US response to the Salisbury poisoning attack to Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s. When pressed again for his view on Trump personally, Johnson pointed out that the US response to Salisbury happened under the Trump administration. They were \u201cshoulder to shoulder\u201d with the UK, he said. They \u201ccould not have been more supportive\u201d. But Johnson declined both opportunities to praise Trump personally as a leader. In contrast, Trump has repeatedly spoken of his admiration for Johnson. Yesterday he said Johnson was \u201cvery capable\u201d and a few weeks ago he told LBC that Johnson was a \u201cfantastic man and [the] exact right guy for the times\u201d. This is what Boris Johnson said when he was asked about the footage apparently showing him laughing at Donald Trump at a reception last night. \u201cDo you not take President Trump seriously,\u201d he was asked. He replied: No. That\u2019s complete nonsense. I don\u2019t know where that\u2019s come from. My colleague Owen Gibson has the answer. Q: Did you make it clear to Trump that the NHS would not be on the table in trade talks? If so, does that mean this time next year the UK could be leaving the transition with no EU trade deal and no US trade deal? Johnson says the questions are now scraping the bottom of the barrel. He will wrap up. He ends with a riff about the choice at the election: between getting Brexit done, and having two referendums. There is also a choice about Nato. He wants to strengthen Nato. Corbyn wants to scrap it, he says. And Diane Abbott wants to disband MI5, he claims. (She doesn\u2019t, although in the 1980s she signed an early day motion that implied that she did.) And that\u2019s it. The press conference is over. I will post a summary soon. Q: Trump said yesterday he did not know Prince Andrew. But there are lots of photographs of them together. Is Trump an amnesiac or a liar? Johnson says that is a good effort to get an answer on something that did not come up at the summit. Q: Did the issue of Turkey\u2019s purchase of Russian missiles come up? Johnson says this did not come up formally at the meeting. Q: President Trump wants the UK to take more Islamic State fighters back. Are we going to take them back? Johnson says our legal system makes it very hard to secure convictions if people return. People must accept the consequences for their choices. Q: [From the Telegraph] Are you concerned about how the full text of the dossier about the UK-US trade talks became public? (The Telegraph has implied the Russians were involved.) Johnson says he thought this material had been on the internet for some time. He says he is not concerned about this. Q: President Trump said every leader he had spoken to here has agreed not to let Huawei play a role in its critical infrastructure. He spoke to you last night. So does that mean the UK will not let Huawei build the 5G network here. Johnson says he does not want the country to be \u201cunnecessary hostile to investment from overseas\u201d. But he will not prejudice security. Those principles will decide his approach to Huawei. This is from the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn on this topic. Q: Were you joking about President Trump at the reception last night? Johnson denies it. That suggestion is \u201ccomplete nonsense\u201d, he says. Johnson is now taking questions. Q: President Trump has spoken of his admiration for you. Do you think the president, as a man, is good for the west and good for Britain? Johnson says America has been a loyal ally to the UK. The alliance has been good for the UK. After the Salisbury poisoning attack, the US expelled 60 Russian diplomats. He contrasts that with the approach taken by Jeremy Corbyn, who wanted to involve Russia in the investigation. This happened under the current administration, he says. Johnson sidesteps opportunity to praise Trump personally. Here is the declaration issued at the end of the Nato conference. Boris Johnson is giving a press conference at the end of the Nato summit. He starts with a short speech about the value of Nato. One of the interesting moment in the ITV leaders\u2019 debate came when Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson were both asked if the monarchy was fit for purpose. Tories assume that Corbyn will always on the royal family agenda (not singing the national anthem damaged him badly), but on this occasion Corbyn said the monarchy needed improvement, and the audience applauded. Johnson said it was beyond reproach, and his reply was met with stony silence. Corbyn gave the right answer - so much so that Johnson resorted a few days later to claiming that, when he had been asked about the monarchy, he had actually been speaking about the monarch (ie, the Queen). But today Corbyn hasn\u2019t had such a good outing on royal family territory. In an interview with ITV\u2019s Julia Etchingham he was asked if he watched the Queen\u2019s speech on Christmas day. He said that he normally did, although the full exchange suggests otherwise. ITV has sent out the transcript of the exchange. JE: Talk to us a bit about Christmas in the Corbyn household. Do you sit down to watch the Queen\u2019s speech? Mr Corbyn. JC: It\u2019s on the morning, usually we have it on .. some of the time. JE: It\u2019s not on in the morning .. it\u2019s at three o\u2019clock in the afternoon JC: It\u2019s when its repeated .. in the afternoon JE: So you don\u2019t sit down, as a family, to watch the Queen speech. JC: We don\u2019t watch television very much on Christmas Day. Maybe a film in the evening. Erm I\u2019d like to do a bit of exercise on Christmas morning JE: You do some exercise on Christmas morning. I don\u2019t think the Queen\u2019s speech is in the morning. It\u2019s three o\u2019clock in the afternoon. That\u2019s when everybody watches it. JC: Well. Our Christmas is sometimes ... JE: You don\u2019t watch it do you Mr Corbyn? JC: There is lots .. lots to do .. I enjoy the presence of my family and friends around Christmas. Obviously, like everybody else does. And, I also visit the homeless shelter, either on Christmas Day, or the day before, to talk to, and listen to people\u2019s lives, about how they could be made better with a government that cared for them. It\u2019s not quite Frost/Nixon, although Corbyn would probably have been better off just saying he caught up with the Queen\u2019s speech through the news (if at all), like most of the population. Here is the clip of President Trump calling Justin Trudeau \u201ctwo-faced\u201d. Trump says he will not be holding a further press conference. He has done plenty of press conferences, he says. Trump cancels press conference expected at end of Nato summit. (That will probably be a relief to No 10.) Donald Trump criticised Canada for not spending 2% of GDP on defence. He says he called Justin Trudeau, the Canadian PM, about that. He says Trudeau was not happy about that. He also described Trudeau as \u201ctwo-faced\u201d over the footage of Trudeau apparently joking about Trump at a reception last night. And a a final answer to your questions from me ... Q: What issues do the SNP anticipate in calling another independence referendum in the case of either a returned Tory government, or a new Labour administration? Which would be better for their campaign, is essentially the question. Fighting it out with Johnson or extracting a promise from an incoming PM Corbyn? Chris, Renfrewshire In the election campaign so far, the SNP has been careful not to entertain any \u201cplan B\u201d talk, should either Labour or Tories refuse to grant the s30 order that Holyrood requires to legally hold a second independence referendum. You may recall that an attempt to debate a plan B was swiftly quashed at SNP conference in October, and Sturgeon herself has insisted that a second indyref must meet the \u201cgold standard\u201d internationally. Instead, SNP politicians throw the question back to the other parties: who are you to deny the democratic will of the Scottish people? It will depend on next week\u2019s results how powerful that argument is going to be: Sturgeon has described SNP successes at the ballot box as \u201can instruction to Westminster\u201d. It\u2019s certainly clear already that Labour don\u2019t want to be seen as anti-democratic, so they are willing to entertain a pro-independence mandate at the next Holyrood elections in 2021 as reason to grant a s30 order. But Johnson has said that he\u2019ll refuse under any circumstances. I think both are good for the campaign now, since they both refuse to grant it next year, which is what Sturgeon says she wants, so it fits well with the narrative of Westminster frustrating Scottish democracy. Thanks for all your questions today Next up will be Guardian political correspondent, Kate Proctor. She will be answering any questions you may have about the Brexit party at 12.30pm on Friday. You can ask your question via our form here. President Trump is speaking to reporters at the end of the Nato summit, at a meeting with Angela Merkel, the German chancellor. Trump says he thinks he will solve the trade crisis with China. There must be fairness in trade, he says. Some interesting questions on different issues from readers here. If you\u2019d like to ask a question in the comments please @Libby or via our form. Q: Why has reformation of the Gender Recognition Act, present in the 2017 manifesto, been removed in the 2019 manifesto? Is there any explanation or reassurance for trans and non-binary people in Scotland who are alarmed by the signal that this withdrawal sends? Will the results of the publicly funded consultation carried out to gather information for the planned reformation be made available to the taxpayer? Sophie, 29, Edinburgh, software developer Thanks Sophie, a number of people raised this concern after the manifesto was published, and the Scottish government\u2019s equalities minister Shirley-Anne Somerville sought to reassure them, pointing out that she would be publishing a draft bill following further consultation by the end of the year. But it\u2019s certainly true that this issue has caused a great deal of controversy within the party, with Sturgeon facing a significant amount of push-back on her plans to proceed with a devolved gender recognition act, aimed at streamlining the process by which a transgender person gets legal recognition. The fact that the issue has gone out for consultation twice has alarmed many in the LGBTI community, who saw this as a roll-back from a more solid earlier commitment. But the strength of feeling around the proposals, and the concerns from many women within the party who feel that the impact on equalities legislation and on women-only spaces in particular has not been taken into account , meant that the SG had little option. Q: This election my vote will go to a party that will legalise cannabis. What is the SNP policy on this? Gavin, Dumfriesshire Worth noting first of all that drugs laws are reserved to Westminster. Nicola Sturgeon has said that devolution of drug laws is one her key demands should another party seek SNP support for their minority government after the election and the SNP\u2019s manifesto calls for this and - pending devolution - that the UK government should introduce a supervised drug consumption facility in Glasgow. Delegates at the SNP\u2019s autumn conference in Aberdeen in October also backed the decriminalisation of controlled drugs, branding the Misuse Of Drugs Act, which dates back to 1971, as \u201cnot fit for purpose\u201d. As you\u2019ll probably know, Scotland is dealing with unprecedented numbers of drug related deaths, and this resolution was linked to attempts to open a safe drugs consumption room in Glasgow, which has so far been blocked by the home office. Q: What is SNP stand on more support for veterans in Scotland? Anonymous, disabled veteran from service in the Gulf War, Dunfermline I know that the next Scottish census will include a question about veteran status, a significant change prompted by the British Legion\u2019s campaigning to make it easier to identify and support veterans. I believe that the SNP government was the first UK administration to make this change and also the first to appoint a Veterans\u2019 Commissioner in the autumn of 2018. Practically, there\u2019s support for getting into employment and also for veterans requiring social care, the Scottish Government has exempted the War Disablement Pension from assessment of income \u2013 meaning that veterans get the help they need and keep the full value of this pension. Q: How would a border work between independent-but-in-EU Scotland and out-of-EU England. Would it be a hard border, like the feared one in Scotland? Jack, 29, works in insurance, St Albans That\u2019s going to be one of the looming questions should there be a second independence referendum campaign, and I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t give you as much clarity as I\u2019d like at this stage. In 2014, the yes campaign was able to argue that there would be no border between a newly independent Scotland and the rest of the UK because both would remain within the EU. Not so now of course. On The Andrew Marr Show recently, Sturgeon refused to rule out a hard border, saying: \u201cWe need to see how things play out and what the final relationship between the UK and the EU will be,\u201d and adding that Boris Johnson\u2019s hard Brexit was not an inevitability. \u201cAs that picture clarifies, I will be honest with the people of Scotland but that opens a situation where Scotland\u2019s best interests depend on being independent and in charge of our own future and I don\u2019t want borders.\u201d Q: How far into nationalism is the SNP prepared to go? We\u2019ve seen the effects of nationalism in Italy, amongst the far-right in Germany and with the EDL in England as well as with Trump in North America, for but a few examples. Do you consider it a potentially dangerous path to travel? Tim Eslip, middle-aged professional, England The SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, was questioned on precisely this at the Edinburgh Fringe festival this August, so I think it\u2019s helpful to reproduce her answers at length, since it was the most comprehensive I\u2019ve heard her on this in a while. Asked about the types of nationalism you refer to, she told the audience during an interview with Matt Forde that the \u201ccivic nationalism\u201d of the SNP was \u201con another spectrum altogether\u201d from \u201cfar right, racist, insular movements\u201d seen in other parts of the world. Asked by comedian Matt Forde about Scottish nationalism, Sturgeon said: \u201cA lot of the regimes called nationalist today are not countries striving to be independent, because often they already are, but are based on some kind of racial exceptionalism, or superiority often very illiberal and oppressive of minorities, and Scottish independence is not just at the other end of the spectrum of that, but on another spectrum altogether Questioned specifically about a protester who had been pictured on the Royal Mile with an \u201cEngland get out of Scotland\u201d banner, Sturgeon said: \u201cThe person with that banner does not speak for the SNP. That kind of sentiment has no place in Scotland. You can\u2019t get to a situation in any party where you say we\u2019ll never attract the wrong kind of person but you can be absolutely vehement and resolute about calling it out. The people who put up that banner, I don\u2019t want them in the SNP.\u201d This is from Bloomberg\u2019s Sebastian Salek. I have not seen the text of his speech, but will post more on it when I can track down a copy. Here\u2019s more on the economics of an independent Scotland ... Q: Given that GERS (Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotland) for 2018-9 shows a deficit of \u00a312.6bn or 7.7% of Scottish GDP, how would an independent Scotland pay for the extra spending proposals in the SNP manifesto or even current levels of spending. Richard, Australia Thanks Richard - that\u2019s precisely the question that the Institute for Fiscal Studies, which published an analysis of the SNP\u2019s manifesto spending pledges in the Scotsman this morning, asked. As others have noted, the SNP manifesto was notably slim on costings, and associate director of the IFS David Phillips suggests that this may be because the spending plans would necessitate more, not less, austerity for Scotland if it were to become independent. As I set out in an earlier post on this live blog, Phillips points out that pledges including increasing NHS spending across the UK by \u00a3136 per head to close the gap with Scotland, an end to the two-child benefit cap and an increased national living wage, would require significant outlay at a time when an independent Scotland was also starting out with a serious budget deficit. Phillips adds: \u201cPursuing the types of policies suggested in the SNP manifesto in an independent Scotland would mean either those cuts would have to be even bigger, or other taxes would have to be increased to pay for the proposed net giveaways ... in the short-term at least, independence would likely necessitate more not less austerity.\u201d The SNP\u2019s own growth commission report on the economics of independence, which came out in 2018, proposed that the inherited deficit be cut by growing the economy rather than cutting spending. It also said it should delay launching its own currency and introduce tax cuts for migrants. Analysing the report at the time, the IFS commended it for being honest about \u201cthe challenging public finance position an independent Scotland would start life with\u201d. However, it went on to dispute claims that its economic strategy would end austerity, suggesting it in fact implied cuts in spending and benefits equal to 4% of GDP over a 10-year period. Questioned about Scotland\u2019s notional deficit by Andrew Neil last week, which stands at 7% according to current figures, and whether it could hinder renewed membership of the EU (EU members\u2019 budget deficits must not exceed 3% of GDP) Nicola Sturgeon argued: \u201cOur task is to get our deficit reducing faster. That is principally through growing our economy faster which remaining in the EU or returning to the EU helps us to do.\u201d My colleague Richard Partington has been factchecking the John McDonnell claim that a Labour government would save families an average of \u00a36,700 a year. Here is his verdict. Nationalisation could save households money that would otherwise go to private investors, but is reliant on the smooth execution of Labour\u2019s plan. The party could face difficulties and unintended consequences, putting savings at risk. Some of the savings are also not open to families until 2030. And here is the full article. According to Joe Murphy and Nicholas Cecil in the Evening Standard, No 10 sources have been keen to insist that Boris Johnson was not one of the world leaders joking about Donald Trump at the reception last night. Here is an extract from their story. Downing Street quickly made clear that Mr Johnson had not been involved in any laughing about any disruption caused by the US president\u2019s press conference, which was held at the American ambassador\u2019s residence in Regent\u2019s Park yesterday morning. A senior source said: \u2018The prime minister was hosting and engaging with world leaders. It is others that were having the conversations and Boris certainly was not leading, as can be seen from the clip. \u2018You did not see any commentary from him except for an innocent question as to why one was late.\u2019 If you want to ask a question in the comments please @Libby, so they\u2019re easier to find. Many of you have been asking about the economics of an independent Scotland. Q: This is a question that the Scottish press don\u2019t ask. What would the cost of setting up the structure of an independent Scotland be and where will the newly independent Scotland get the money? Robert, 68, retired, Edinburgh Hi Robert, you\u2019ll recall this was a much-disputed area during the 2014 campaign. A Treasury report in May of that year estimated the costs of setting up an independent state to be around \u00a31.5bn - including \u00a3750m to create a new tax regime and \u00a3400m for computers and IT for welfare - but this was vigorously challenged by the then first minister, Alex Salmond. Prof Patrick Dunleavy of LSE was quoted by both the UK and Scottish governments as the leading expert on transition costs, and he suggested that \u201cstart-up costs\u201d would come in at around \u00a3200m but then a further \u00a3900m would be required for tax and welfare infrastructure. Nicola Sturgeon confirmed in September this year that she had instructed civil servants to work on a second white paper to convince voters of the case for independence, although it should be noted that the original version relied heavily on projected oil revenues which have since plummeted. Q: Would an independent Scotland find it easier to join Efta rather than the EU, which would give an independent Scotland many of the benefits which eg. Norway has, but also allow us to opt out of CFP and the CAP? While the SNP has explored the possibility of rejoining the single market via the European Free Trade Association, with the option of returning to full EU membership later, the response from other member states is mixed. In 2017, Iceland\u2019s foreign minister warned that Scotland could not apply to join Efta until after it had fully separated from the UK, but in the same year Norway said it would keep an open mind to Scottish membership. Accession to Efta is seen as more straightforward than rejoining the EU, but it is not certain that Scotland would then be allowed into the European Economic Area, membership of which would still have to be agreed by the EU. New members of Efta must be accepted unanimously by the existing four members: Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland. Since the Brexit vote, there have been some encouraging noises from EU officials that an independent Scotland could automatically join the EU or inherit the UK\u2019s membership after it leaves. But in 2017, Jacqueline Minor, the European commission\u2019s head of representation in the UK, warned that Scotland would need to formally apply after leaving the UK, although it could be fast-tracked because it already complies with EU rules and regulations. With the possible exception of Nicola Sturgeon, John McDonnell is probably the stand-out media performer of this campaign. His speeches always contain an essential seriousness, but he can also handle media questions without sounding evasive or tetchy as soon as they turn hostile. This wasn\u2019t the most newsy speech of the campaign, and it will be overshadowed by events at that Nato conference later, but he conveyed a positive message and he took quite a large number of critical questions without tripping up. Here are the main points. McDonnell refused to accept Donald Trump\u2019s claims that the NHS would not be on the table in trade talks, saying the US president had a \u201cpassing relationship with reality and truth\u201d. Asked if he thought Trump was lying when he said this yesterday, McDonnell all but said yes. He replied: All the evidence that we\u2019ve seen has demonstrated objectively that it is. Donald Trump has a passing relationship with reality and truth sometimes. I believe in one instance claimed he didn\u2019t know what the initials NHS stood for, so the reality is the evidence is there and the anxiety that we have about the NHS under Boris Johnson regime and his relationship with trump causes us extreme concern. He joked about a Corbyn government having difficult relations with Trump. Asked to respond to what Trump said yesterday about being able to work with Corbyn if he became PM, McDonnell said: It\u2019s encouraging to know that we can maintain a good working relationship with the people of America in the future - [McDonnell paused] after possibly another election. The line about the election prompted laughter from the audience. McDonnell then went on: Obviously, Jeremy will work with leaders all over the world including Donald Trump and we will ensure that whatever happens in the future we will look after the interests of our own people as well as other across the globe. McDonnell said Labour would announce details of its \u201cfirst 100 days\u201d programme before polling day. (See 11.40am.) He described compensating the Waspi (Women Against State Pensions Inequality) women as being akin to bailing out the banks. (See 11.52am.) He suggested the extent of poverty in the UK was incompatible with the values of Christianity. In his speech he said: On Tuesday a new Shelter report also found 135,000 children will be without a home this Christmas. On the same day an analysis by the Equality Trust showed the UK\u2019s six richest people control as much wealth as the poorest 13 million. It all went to show just how unequal our society is. It\u2019s three weeks to Christmas. The celebration of the birth of Jesus. Children going hungry and homeless in the 5th largest economy in the world begs the question: \u201cAre we really living up to the values of Christianity or any other of our religions or beliefs for that matter?\u201d McDonnell brought up a Roman Catholic and for a while trained for the priesthood before deciding that his vocation lay elsewhere. He said a Labour government would save families an average of \u00a36,700. Families with someone eligible for free personal care would save more than \u00a37,000, he said. (See 11.29am.) You have been sending in your questions about the SNP manifesto, policies and campaign which I will be answering until 1.30pm. You can share your questions with us via our form here. Many of you have asked questions about the state of education in Scotland. Q: Does Ms Sturgeon recognise the pledge, \u201cJudge me on my record for education\u201d? As she has not narrowed the attainment gap why should parents and children give her more than an F? Iain RF MacIain, 45, working in education, Scottish Borders Interesting you mention that today \u2013 you no doubt saw the latest Pisa report yesterday, which saw Scotland achieve its lowest scores in maths and science since it first took part in the survey almost 20 years ago, and reported that pupils\u2019 performance in reading tests had recovered only to the level it was at in 2012. A professor of education at Edinburgh University, Lindsay Paterson, described children\u2019s reading performance as \u201cstagnating around mediocrity\u201d, arguing that the reason the attainment gap on reading had narrowed was because middle-class kids were getting worse. The education secretary, John Swinney, described the results as \u201cvery encouraging\u201d, while accepting there were still challenges. The problem is that this is just one element of the overall picture, as you\u2019ll know if you work in education yourself. Another serious concern is teacher shortages. In rural Scotland we have some of the most severe shortages in Europe; also the numbers of days lost to stress-related illness for teachers who are in post; and worries about availability of subjects to children taking high school exams, with reports of kids travelling for hours each week to access teaching in their chosen subject which is only available in another school in their council area. Q: Why don\u2019t the SNP stand candidates in England or Wales? From the reactions to debate it seems they\u2019d win a lot of people over. Levi, 20, student, Caerphilly As a nationalist party whose primary aim is Scottish independence, the SNP has only ever fielded candidates in Scotland, but it\u2019s a question that often comes up \u2013 particularly after viewers have been impressed by Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s performance in UK-wide televised debates. Indeed, the question of whether non-residents of Scotland could vote for the SNP featured in a list of most searched-for terms provided by Google after Sturgeon impressed voters across the UK in the first leaders\u2019 debate of the 2015 general election campaign. And the SNP is well aware of the usefulness of appealing to voters elsewhere: the question of whether Labour could make a post-election pact with the SNP has become one of the key debates of the general election \u2013 but also one of the Conservatives\u2019 main attack lines. I\u2019m Libby Brooks, the Guardian\u2019s Scotland correspondent, and will be answering your questions on the SNP manifesto, policies and campaign today. I\u2019m based in Glasgow and returned to Scotland \u2013 where I grew up \u2013 on a six-month secondment to help out with coverage of the 2014 independence referendum and since then I\u2019ve reported on some of the most seismic developments in Scottish politics for decades. Before that I was an editor and columnist on the opinion desk and have also written for features, foreign and home news over the years. If you have a question you can send it to us by filling in the form here. Here is the full text of the John McDonnell speech. McDonnell says he thinks that, just as the Attlee government is remembered for founding the NHS, the Corbyn government will be remembered for setting up a national education service. Education is not a commodity, he says. It is a gift from one generation to another. The national education service will transform lives, he says. He says the number of young people involved in Labour\u2019s campaign is terrific. He says he thinks people will be surprised by how many young people turn out to vote next week. Young people have forced the climate crisis onto the agenda, he says. This is a make-or-break moment for the world. And that\u2019s it. The Q&amp;A is over. I will post a summary soon. Q: Why were you not more explicit about the Waspi women pledge in the manifesto? McDonnell says he was working on this for 18 months. He was worried if it got announced on manifesto day, it would be swamped by other issues. And he says he wanted the policy to be launched on a day when Labour could also launch its calculator, to show how much women might get. That took a lot of work, he says. He says the money will be paid over five years. If the government had lost the court case on this, it would have to have paid up anyway. He says this is a lot of money. But \u00a3100bn has been given away to the rich in tax cuts, he says. And he says when the banks were in trouble, hundreds of billions were found to bail them out. He says he wanted a scheme that was straightforward and readily implementable. He is proud of it, he says. McDonnell says Labour will reintroduce sectoral collective bargaining for wages. That will lead to wages going up, he says. Q: Do you support the RMT holding a 27-day rail strike? McDonnell says he hopes both sides will get around the table to negotiate. He says the union is trying to address safety issues. Q: Are you worried about leave supporters not backing Labour? And what has happened to prominent remainers like Keir Starmer, who are not being put up by the party for interviews? McDonnell says people like Starmer are campaigning all over the country. On Brexit, he says Labour would let the people decide. But he says this election is not just about Brexit. People are asking about other issues, he says. Q: You said you will release details of how you will fund your plans in the next few days. Isn\u2019t that too late? McDonnell says the questioner misunderstood the point he was making earlier. (See 11.30am.) He says what he was referring to were announcements about what would happen in the first 100 days of a Corbyn government. The party will also announce details of its first Queen\u2019s speech, and some details of its first budget, he says. Q: Isn\u2019t the idea that Labour can save families \u00a36,700 a year make-believe? McDonnell says Labour\u2019s plans are costed. And they have been tested, he says. In the party he has a reputation as a bureaucrat who insists on detail. He says Labour\u2019s plans are credible. But the party also has an ambitious programme, he says. He says he wants to ensure there is never another programme like the Dispatches documentary. (See 11.14am.) Q: Your manifesto largely protects middle-earners. Is that right? McDonnell says he wants a fair tax system. At the last election he was accused of having a magic money tree. Now the Tories have a magic money forest. If there is a magic money tree, it is in the Cayman Islands. He says Labour will dig it up and bring it back to the UK. Q: Donald Trump says he can work with Jeremy Corbyn. Is that encouraging? McDonnell says Labour will work well with whoever is in the White House \u2013 after the next presidential election, he jokes. He then says the party was encouraged by what Trump said yesterday about Corbyn. John McDonnell is now taking questions. Q: Is President Trump lying when he says the NHS is not on the table in UK-US trade talks? McDonnell says all the evidence suggests it is on the table. Donald Trump has a passing relationship with reality and truth sometimes. McDonnell says he will say more about how Labour would implement change before polling day. For those of us, who believe that real change is not only necessary but readily achievable, we need to spell out in detail how concretely, step by step, that change can be brought about. We have done that, through our manifesto and our grey book. And I\u2019ll be saying even more about that theme in the days ahead. So that before polling day people will know not just what we want to achieve. McDonnell says Labour policies could save families more than \u00a37,000 a year if someone needs personal care. That\u2019s why Labour has a fair approach to tax: raising income tax rates for the top 5% while closing loopholes and taxing income from wealth the same as that from work. And what a difference that could make. Paying for free childcare \u2013 saving on average almost \u00a33,000 a year per child. Providing free school meals for all primary school children, saving parents over \u00a3400 and ensuring that no child struggles to concentrate because of hunger. Paying for the personal care that we or our family members might need in old age. If you or someone in your family needs care at home, that could mean a saving of over \u00a37,000 a year. Paying for a reduction in rail fares, to keep the cost of living down and encourage more people on to public transport. And paying for free prescriptions, saving those with monthly prescriptions over a hundred pounds a year. Ask our experts a question As part of our election coverage you can ask our political team any questions you have about the general election, and they will post their responses on the politics live blog between 12.30pm and 1.30pm every Monday, Wednesday and Friday until polling week. Today, Libby Brooks, the Guardian\u2019s Scotland correspondent, will answer your questions about the SNP manifesto. You can ask your question via our form here. McDonnell dismisses claims that providing services for free is unrealistic. Because you\u2019ve heard the Tories and Liberal Democrats over recent weeks telling you that the essentials of life can\u2019t be provided free at the point of use, paid for through taxation. And you\u2019re a dreamer if you think otherwise. The same people whose political ancestors would have laughed at the idea of free healthcare, free roads or education are now telling you that we can\u2019t possibly provide free social care, prescriptions or childcare. McDonnell summarises some of the Labour measures that would lift living standards. In our exciting manifesto launched two weeks ago, Labour set out its plan for real change. Change that will help tackle that burden of rising living costs. How can we do that? After nearly 10 years during which it\u2019s seemed impossible that anything might change. I\u2019ll tell you where it starts. It starts with adopting the principle of \u201cdo no harm\u201d. \u201cAt least don\u2019t make things worse.\u201d So we\u2019ll scrap universal credit, stopping its rollout and putting in place a package of fixes while we design a replacement that\u2019s fit for purpose. Of course that won\u2019t help everyone. We need to raise wages across the country so people don\u2019t need to rely on universal credit. That starts with our real living wage: \u00a310 an hour, straight away, for everyone over 16. An average pay rise of up to \u00a36,000 a year. A pay rise for seven and a half million people. For public sector workers, it\u2019s a boost of 5% in the first year of a Labour government ... Our proposals to bring the major energy companies into public ownership has been independently estimated to save an average of \u00a3142 a year, while our proposals to retrofit almost every home in the country would slash the average household bill by over \u00a3400 a year. McDonnell says many people have had problems with the cost of living over the last decade. Stagnant wages have not affected just a few people; a majority of people have lost out, he says. He claims families have lost almost \u00a36,000 a year as a result of Tory policies. Labour has published today a report setting out the cost to most, of the nearly 10 years of the Conservatives in government and the policies of privatisation under successive Conservative governments. Going all the way back to the Thatcher and Major administrations selling off our nation\u2019s public utilities and natural assets. \u2018The family silver\u2019 \u2013 as a former Conservative prime minister called it. Profiteering through privatisation and the Conservatives\u2019 failure to curb rising bills has cost families nearly \u00a36,000 a year since 2010. While wages are still lower than before the financial crash, inaction and economic mismanagement by the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats over the past decade has meant the cost of living for millions of households has soared. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, is giving a speech in Birmingham now. He says he watched the Channel 4 Dispatches documentary about child poverty on Monday. It was shocking, he says. He urges people who have not seen it to watch it. The Guardian review of the programme is here. Here is a question from below the line. Do candidates see postal votes before election day? Candidates, or their agents, do get to see postal votes as they come in. They don\u2019t get counted before polling day, but when they are opened someone has to check they are in order, and that process is overseen by the candidates. But, under election law, no one is allowed to release information about how people have actually voted until polls close. So, if a candidate were to say \u2018Postal votes show we\u2019re on X%, and our rivals are on Y%\u2019, they would probably be committing an offence. In the video clip cited above, in response to a question about his seat being at risk, Dominic Raab says: \u201cHave a look at the postal votes.\u201d But, beyond giving a knowing look, he does not go much further than that, saying he is not giving too much away. No one is likely to be marching him away in handcuffs on the basis of that. Extinction Rebellion protesters have targeted the Liberal Democrats this morning, with one of them gluing himself to the Lib Dem battlebus. These are from my colleague Peter Walker, who is there. At his press conference later Donald Trump may be asked about the video that appeared to show world leaders including Boris Johnson, Justin Trudeau and Emmanuel Macron joking about him at a reception last night. Our story about it is here. And here is the video. There\u2019s an interesting analysis of the SNP\u2019s manifesto from the Institute of Fiscal Studies this morning. Writing in the Scotsman, the associate director of the IFS David Phillips notes the absence of costings from the document launched by Nicola Sturgeon in Glasgow last week, but suggests that this may be because the spending plans would necessitate more, not less, austerity for Scotland if it were to become independent. Acknowledging that the manifesto \u201cisn\u2019t really about a plan of action for five years of governing the UK \u2013 rather it is about starting the process of leaving the UK in the next year\u201d, Phillips points out that plans including increasing NHS spending across the UK by \u00a3136 per head to close the gap with Scotland would require significant outlay at a time when an independent Scotland was also starting out with a serious budget deficit. Phillips adds: Pursuing the types of policies suggested in the SNP manifesto in an independent Scotland would mean either those cuts would have to be even bigger, or other taxes would have to be increased to pay for the proposed net giveaways ... in the short-term at least, independence would likely necessitate more not less austerity. It should be noted that the IFS has already described both Labour and Conservative manifesto spending plans as \u201cnot credible\u201d. The SNP\u2019s own growth commission report on the economics of independence accepted that a newly independent Scotland would have to cut spending significantly in order to manage its deficit. Boris Johnson is delivering a speech at the opening of the Nato summit. He says: The fact that we live in peace today demonstrates the power of the simple proposition at the heart of this alliance: that for as long as we stand together, no one could hope to defeat us \u2013 and therefore no one will start a war. This essential principle is enshrined in article 5 of the North Atlantic treaty: that if any one of us is attacked, all of us will go to their defence. If Nato has a motto, it is: one for all, and all for one. And here\u2019s the Boris Johnson/Donald Trump handshake. President Trump has now posed for a photograph with Boris Johnson. It came after Johnson and Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary general, formally welcomed him to the summit. Johnson and Stoltenberg had a handshake and picture with every Nato leader one by one, ahead of the \u201cfamily photo\u201d taking place about now. On his arrival at the Nato summit the French president, Emmanuel Macron, defended his recent claim that the organisation was experiencing \u201cbrain death\u201d. Asked if he still stood by the comment, he replied: Yes, absolutely. In fact it allowed us to raise some crucial debates. He said those included how to create a durable peace in Europe and clarifying who was the enemy. So I think it was our responsibility to raise ambiguities that could be harmful, and to tackle a real strategic debate. It has started, I am satisfied. If you\u2019re a UK viewer living outside Scotland, and feeling deprived of your leaders\u2019 debate fix last night, then read on. It\u2019s fair to say that STV\u2019s debate between the Scottish party leaders \u2013 excluding Patrick Harvie of the Scottish Greens, bizarrely \u2013 was rather a shout-fest, although it was refreshing to see Nicola Sturgeon properly interrogated on Holyrood policy, which seldom happens when she takes part in the UK-wide debates. But of course that\u2019s because education, health and so on are devolved \u2013 so while it was good to see those areas covered, they are not technically relevant to a UK general election. The format, which really felt its lack of a live audience, involved a series of questions and interrogations of each leader by the other politicians, rather than by the host, Colin Mackay, and so lent itself to people (men, Sturgeon was the only woman there) talking across one another. At one point I looked up from my notes to see the Scottish Conservatives\u2019 Jackson Carlaw shouting at the Lib Dems\u2019 Willie Rennie, Rennie shouting at Labour\u2019s Richard Leonard, and Sturgeon standing there with her arms folded like a teacher who has already tried multiple timeouts with the kids and is now just waiting for the lunch bell to go. Some interesting points: Tory leader Carlaw urged viewers to \u201clend us your vote to stop indyref2\u201d \u2013 clearly the anti-independence message is working as well for the Scottish Tories, if not better than getting Brexit done. Challenged on Boris Johnson\u2019s previous remarks about Muslim women and gay men, he admitted they were \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d, but insisted he would judge him on his performance in office. Carlaw and Rennie attacked Labour\u2019s \u201cclear as mud\u201d position on Brexit, mocking Leonard for being \u201cconstantly overruled\u201d by Jeremy Corbyn. Leonard struggled to answer the charge that voters didn\u2019t trust Corbyn to stand up for the union. Sturgeon failed to offer a plan B if a new Tory (or Labour) government refused her demand for the powers to hold a second independence referendum next year. Challenged on putting independence before public services, her defence of the latest Pisa report, which saw Scotland achieve its lowest scores in maths and science since it first took part in the survey almost 20 years ago and reported that pupils\u2019 performance in reading tests had recovered only to the level it was at in 2012, was weak. But at least it prompted the zingiest response of the debate from Rennie: If you are telling me that a line on a chart going down is optimistic, then the problem of numeracy in your government goes right to the top. Boris Johnson, or whoever controls his Twitter account, has just posted a picture of the PM meeting a blonde-haired admirer yesterday. But not that one ... President Trump has also retweeted the group photograph from last night. President Trump has tweeted about his meeting with Boris Johnson last night. But he hasn\u2019t included a picture. President Macron has arrived at the Nato summit venue. Arriving at the Nato summit Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary general, said he was confident differences with Turkey over a new alliance defence plan to protect the Baltic states and Poland could be resolved. As the Press Association reports, the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, has threatened to block the plan after criticism of Turkey\u2019s incursion against the Kurds in northern Syria. Stoltenberg said: I am confident that we will find a solution to the updating of the revised defence plan. He said Nato leaders would for the first time discuss the rise of China, which was now the world\u2019s second biggest spender on defence. \u201cThis provides opportunities and also challenges,\u201d he said. On his arrival at the Nato summit, Boris Johnson was asked why he was avoiding being photographed with Donald Trump. (See 8.40am.) Johnson said he would be photographed with every Nato leader. Our main focus here will be all news relating to the general election campaign, and not all the news from the Nato summit, but obviously there will be an overlap. In terms of Nato coverage, we will be focusing in particular on what gets said at the final press conferences from Boris Johnson and Donald Trump. Here is the agenda for the day. From 7.45am: Nato leaders arrive at the summit. 10am: The Nato summit officially starts. 11am: John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, gives a speech in Birmingham. As my colleague Heather Stewart reports, he will claim that a Labour government would save families an average of \u00a36,700 a year by \u201cputting a stop to rip-off Britain\u201d. 2pm: Johnson is due to hold a press conference at the end of the Nato summit. 3pm: Trump is due to hold his own press conference. 7.30pm: Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, is interviewed by Andrew Neil on BBC One. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Damien Gayle. Boris Johnson has arrived for the Nato summit taking place at a hotel outside Watford. On his way in, he said he had had a \u201cvery good\u201d bilateral meeting with Donald Trump in No 10 last night. He continued: We discussed the future of Nato, we discussed what is going on in Syria and various other matters. However, Johnson does not seem to have thought it was important enough for the photographers to have been allowed to record it. Trump is seen as electorally toxic in the UK (he came close to admitting as much yesterday) and, although Johnson and Trump attended events at both Buckingham Palace and No 10 yesterday, as well as having their own bilateral, there is still not public picture of just the two men together. On his arrival at the Nato summit, Johnson also said there was more that united the alliance than divided it. He said: Clearly it is very important that the alliance stays together, but there is far, far more that unites us than divides us. Barry Gardiner, the shadow international trade secretary, has mounted a stout defence of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s record on foreign intervention and his attitude to Nato, suggesting that his peace-promoting credentials are in fact the best defence policy for Britain. Corbyn has, as they say in politics, been on a journey as regards his position on Nato. Five years ago \u2013 as a backbencher \u2013 he was speaking at an anti-Nato conference. Now, the Labour party he leads is campaigning on a manifesto promise to maintain the UK\u2019s commitment to Nato. Responding to suggestions that Corbyn was ambivalent over Nato, which many consider a cornerstone of the UK\u2019s national defence, Gardiner retorted: The way you defend this country is to make sure that you don\u2019t go on foreign wars and don\u2019t start bombing before you have started thinking. Ouch! Gardiner was challenged: Is that what Nato does? He continued: Consistently, if you look at the Iraq war, who was on the right side of history on that? Jeremy Corbyn was not the president at the time and indeed not the Labour party at the time under Tony Blair. But all of parliament went into that, Jeremy Corbyn did not. What I\u2019m saying is that if you look at the way in which we want to use a defensive alliance it is to think carefully through positions, to learn the lessons of the Chilcot report, learn about how we should try and prevent conflict and de-escalate a situation, rather than actually then promoting a conflict. When we went into Libya, when we joined the bombing raid on Libya, we were told it was absolutely essential to do that. I didn\u2019t vote for that, neither did Jeremy Corbyn. That has proved to be a disaster. It\u2019s proved to allow groups like Isis to form and take control and to make that country a complete basket case. Speaking on Today this morning, Jeremy Hunt denied any knowledge of talks between the UK and the US on NHS drugs pricing, despite documents unearthed recently showing that officials began negotiations during his tenure as health secretary. \u201cWhen I was health secretary, I wasn\u2019t aware of any talks going on with the United States at all,\u201d said Hunt, who left his post as foreign secretary when Boris Johnson became prime minister. In so far as there have been preliminary discussions between officials on both sides, not between politicians, we have made absolutely clear that NHS drugs prices are not on the table. I\u2019m afraid this is the traditional scare story. What would really damage the NHS are economic policies that destroy jobs in the economy and destroy the tax base that the NHS depends on. We have at the moment a very, very radical economic platform from John McDonnell which would do immense damage to our tax base and therefore our ability to fund the NHS. Since that last post, it\u2019s Damien Gayle now at the helm of the blog, taking over from my colleague Kate Lyonsr, and filling in while Andy Sparrow eats his cornflakes and limbers up to take you through the day\u2019s political drama. Jeremy Hunt, the former foreign secretary, has come out with all guns blazing over Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s attitude to Nato, the transatlantic alliance meeting in London. Last night, the heads of government of the Nato member states met for tea with the Queen at Buckingham palace, amid concern over the alliance\u2019s future after Donald Trump\u2019s complaints that other allies were not spending enough on guns and soldiers. Speaking on the Today programme, Hunt backed Trump\u2019s comments, pointing out that France, for example, spends just 1.5% of its total budget on defence, compared with the US spend of 4%, which he claimed contributed towards \u201ca third of the cost of defending Europe\u201d. But, he added: The biggest thing on the minds of those Nato leaders which they are perhaps not talking about is that in eight days\u2019 time the second-most important member of Nato [I think he means us] could elect the most anti-Nato, anti-western leader in the history of the alliance, and Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s been very open in the past about wanting to dismantle Nato. What the papers said A story to give you a chuckle over your breakfast: a Tory councillor climbed dustbins and scaled a school fence to escape a climate crisis debate after she met with a crowd unimpressed with her answers. Nancy Bikson\u2019s great escape would have stayed secret were it not for a 13-year-old girl who saw the incident at Priory school in Lewes, East Sussex. Trust me, everything about this story is designed to amuse. The day ahead The prime minister\u2019s time will be split between campaigning in the home counties and hosting leaders for the Nato summit. Jeremy Corbyn is campaigning in the East Midlands, while John McDonnell gives a speech on the economy in the West Midlands outlining how Labour\u2019s policies will save average people money. In the Lib Dem camp, Jo Swinson will visit a youth centre in London and then sit down for her Andrew Neil interview, which will be broadcast at 7.30pm. The Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, will speak at a public meeting in Kirkby-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, in the morning while the SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, will campaign in Edinburgh. The Ulster Unionist party will launch its manifesto in Belfast. Good morning and welcome to the Guardian live blog, where we bring you all the politics news you could possibly want. We\u2019re a little more than a week out from the election and there\u2019s a lot going on today, so strap in. Donald Trump\u2019s presence in the UK for Nato talks continues to loom over the election. The summit started with heated exchanges and further tensions are expected as leaders meet again today. Donald Trump is seen as an electoral liability for the Conservatives over fears that he may be interested in putting the NHS on the table in US-UK trade talks \u2013 though yesterday the president categorically denied the US was interested in the health service. Boris Johnson has so far managed to keep his distance from Trump, with Marina Hyde writing that Johnson will continue to studiously avoid the president because \u201cTories sense even a handshake with Trump could piss their electoral bed\u201d. Meanwhile, Labour will today try to convince voters of the financial benefit of electing a Corbyn government. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, will say his party\u2019s policies would save families an average of \u00a36,700 a year by \u201cputting a stop to rip-off Britain\u201d as Labour narrows its focus to bread-and-butter issues. In a dossier to be published alongside the speech, McDonnell will claim that policies including nationalising utilities and reducing the cost of rail season tickets \u2013 as well as free childcare for all two- to four-year-olds, free prescription charges and free school meals \u2013 will help the hip pocket of average households. However, Labour candidates are privately concerned about the scattergun nature of the giveaways, with one Labour saying the manifesto, while good, is \u201cjust long and confusing\u201d and some promises could appear too good to be true.",

Top stories Donald Trump has cut short his attendance at the Nato summit in London, calling the Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau \u201ctwo-faced\u201d after footage emerged of world leaders joking about Trump during the summit. A group including Trudeau, Boris Johnson and Emmanuel Macron were filmed discussing Trump informally during a function at Buckingham Palace, prompting the US president to cancel his final press obligations after two days of talks characterised by sharp disputes with allies. Johnson later bristled in response to questions as to whether he takes the US president seriously, and pointedly did not refer to him in his closing comments. A Senate committee has recommended that Scott Morrison order an inquiry into the energy minister, Angus Taylor, after it found that Taylor \u201cconsciously used his position as an MP and minister\u201d to try to influence an investigation into clearing of grasslands at a property he and his family part-own. \u201cIt is inconceivable that Mr Taylor was unaware that he and his family stood to benefit directly from his actions,\u201d the interim report states. In a dissenting report, Coalition senators said the evidence showed Taylor had acted appropriately and in accordance with the rules, and accused the Labor-Greens dominated committee of a partisan attack.

Australia New Zealand\u2019s offer to take refugees in offshore detention may still be on the table but Scott Morrison has denied making a \u201csecret deal\u201d with Jacqui Lambie, after the independent senator\u2019s support enabled the repeal of medevac laws. Major multinationals and Australia\u2019s biggest accounting firms have failed to inform the public sufficiently about their tax obligations, a senior ATO official has warned. Three climate activists have been denied bail and will remain in custody for two weeks in what is being regarded as a \u201cQueensland first\u201d. Members of the activist group said they believed the decision was out of step with other similar cases. The world Two Russian diplomats have been expelled from Germany, with state prosecutors reporting \u201csufficient evidence\u201d links them to the assassination of a Chechen separatist in Berlin in August, in what\u2019s being described as a \u201csecond Skripal case\u201d. Gene editing to immunise Chinese twins against HIV may have created unintended mutations, the public release of controversial research suggests. The Chinese biophysicist He Jiankui is accused of ignored ethical and scientific norms in creating the twins. Spanish authorities have detonated a grenade found thrown on to the grounds of a centre for unaccompanied foreign minors, just weeks after the facility was singled out by the far-right Vox party\u2019s leader. Greenpeace claims radiation hotspots have been detected near the former Fukoshima nuclear plant, which the Japanese government was planning to use as the symbolic start of the torch relay for the 2020 Olympics in March.

Because the dirt roads are so heavily compacted, seedlings have little chance of successfully repopulating the area.</p> <p>Using drones to survey the 27 sites in northern Ontario, Trevor Hesselink, a land-use planner and former forestry policy analyst, found that the scars made up anywhere from 10% to nearly 25% of the areas where forests had once been logged.</p> <p>\u201cThe extent of the scarring, and getting on the ground to see the longevity of the suppression effect, surprised me the most,\u201d Hesselink told the Guardian.</p> <p>Wildlands estimates that nearly 650,000 hectares of forest in Ontario \u2013 eight times the area of New York City \u2013 have been lost in last three decades due to scarring.</p> <p>While the province makes up a small part of the country\u2019s overall logging industry, Hesselink and his team believe the long-term damage to forests is probably more common than many realize. The practice of \u201cfull tree harvest\u201d \u2013 where entire trees are cut down and moved to a landing area to be processed \u2013 is also used in western provinces, where the logging industry is more widespread. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"360d5d9e362a545df748bff69b6c15c19f4bc6ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/360d5d9e362a545df748bff69b6c15c19f4bc6ae/0_185_2456_1473/1000.png\" alt=\"Aerial photography shows scarring left by logging operations in Ontario forests.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The extent of the scarring \u2026 surprised me the most,\u2019 said Trevor Hesselink, a land-use planner and former forestry policy analyst.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wildlands League</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been told over and over that Canada has a near-zero deforestation rate,\u201d said Janet Sumner, Wildlands League\u2019s executive director. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t what we were seeing in the bush.

          "bodyText": "Canada\u2019s logging industry has a larger and more damaging impact on forest health than previously thought, a new report has found, casting doubt on the sustainability of forestry management in the country. The findings also raise questions about Canada\u2019s ability to make good on its international climate commitments, which partly rely on forests for carbon sequestration. In a report released on Wednesday, the Toronto-based conservation group Wildlands League found that \u201clogging scars\u201d \u2013 the vestigial remains of roads, landings and turnoffs meant to accommodate heavy machinery \u2013 suppress forest regeneration. Because the dirt roads are so heavily compacted, seedlings have little chance of successfully repopulating the area. Using drones to survey the 27 sites in northern Ontario, Trevor Hesselink, a land-use planner and former forestry policy analyst, found that the scars made up anywhere from 10% to nearly 25% of the areas where forests had once been logged. \u201cThe extent of the scarring, and getting on the ground to see the longevity of the suppression effect, surprised me the most,\u201d Hesselink told the Guardian. Wildlands estimates that nearly 650,000 hectares of forest in Ontario \u2013 eight times the area of New York City \u2013 have been lost in last three decades due to scarring. While the province makes up a small part of the country\u2019s overall logging industry, Hesselink and his team believe the long-term damage to forests is probably more common than many realize. The practice of \u201cfull tree harvest\u201d \u2013 where entire trees are cut down and moved to a landing area to be processed \u2013 is also used in western provinces, where the logging industry is more widespread. \u201cWe\u2019ve been told over and over that Canada has a near-zero deforestation rate,\u201d said Janet Sumner, Wildlands League\u2019s executive director. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t what we were seeing in the bush. So we took a closer look. And now we know.\u201d Canada\u2019s forests have become central to the Liberal goverment\u2019s pledge to fight the climate crisis. As part of his re-election campaign, the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, promised to plant 2bn trees in the next decade. Hesselink\u2019s findings also call into question Canada\u2019s calculations of carbon sequestration from its forests. The lost carbon storage could be as high as 41 megatons by 2030 \u2013 or an entire year\u2019s worth of passenger vehicle emissions in Canada. \u201cAs long as these logging scars are suppressing the natural renewal of forest, they\u2019re forgoing carbon that could removed from the atmosphere,\u201d said Hesselink.",

          "bodyText": "Finally, back in the markets, renewed trade war optimism has pushed Wall Street higher. The Dow is up 200 points, after Bloomberg reportedly earlier that the US and China were closer to a deal than Donald Trump suggested yesterday. European stock markets also rallied, in their best day for a month (after the worst day in two months). The FTSE 100 has a more modest rally, up 29 points at 7,188. It was held back by the pound, which is still at a 7-month high at nearly $1.31. Goodnight! GW Here\u2019s my colleague Patrick Collinson on M&amp;G\u2019s property fund freeze: One of the UK\u2019s biggest property funds, which owns shopping centres across the country, has alarmed investors by banning withdrawals and blaming both Brexit and the retail downturn for its problems. The \u00a32.5bn M&amp;G Property Portfolio was suspended after \u201cunusually high and sustained outflows\u201d \u2013 demand from investors for their money back \u2013 prompted by \u201cBrexit-related political uncertainty and ongoing structural shifts in the UK retail sector\u201d. M&amp;G admitted it had been unable to sell commercial property fast enough to fund the rush for the door by investors, leaving it with no choice but to prevent further withdrawals. The fund\u2019s biggest holdings include shopping centres such as Fremlin Walk in Maidstone, Kent, where House of Fraser is one of the biggest tenants. M&amp;G said the suspension would give it time to raise cash to repay investors. While the fund is suspended, M&amp;G will cut the fees it charges to manage the fund. M&amp;G did not give a timeline for when the fund would be reopened, saying it was monitoring the situation daily. The financial adviser Chase de Vere told investors not to panic, but added: \u201cM&amp;G has struggled with this due to number of investors cashing out and a relatively high exposure to retail properties, which are proving difficult to sell. \u201cAs a result, the amount of cash in the fund has fallen to about 5%, making it difficult for them to meet ongoing redemptions.\u201d More here. Rival property funds are scrambling to reassure investors. Aviva says it has build a 30% cash level in its property fund, due to \u201cheightened market uncertainty\u201d. BMO has said its fund holds 24% of its assets in cash, and is still open (vie Reuters). That is meant to reassure investors that they can withdraw their funds when they like (preventing a panicky dash to the exit). But it may also annoy some customers -- after all, these funds are meant to be putting cash to work, not sitting on it. MorningStar reported today that investors are being charged management fees even if their cash hasn\u2019t been invested. Ben Yearsley, investment director at Shore Financial Planning, told them: \u201cIt\u2019s a disgrace. These funds are offering something that they are not delivering. It is plain wrong to charge investors the full annual fee on a fund when only 70% of their money is being invested.\u201d More here: Are Property Funds Holding Too Much Cash? Too much spare cash wasn\u2019t M&amp;G\u2019s problem, of course..... M&amp;G investors could be trapped in the Property Portfolio fund for some time. Laura Suter of stockbroker AJ Bell points out that the fund was closed for two months after the Brexit vote: M&amp;G\u2019s problems may have been exacerbated by the crisis at Neil Woodford\u2019s asset management empire. Woodford was forced to freeze his once-popular Woodford Equity Income fund this summer, after a wave of redemption requests. Investors now face massive losses - they could lose two-thirds of their money once the fund is wound down. The Woodford debacle has highlighted the danger of open-ended funds. Last month, FT Advisor reported there has been \u201ca surge\u201d of property fund redemptions since. M&amp;G\u2019s move is the first suspension of a major property fund since the panic after the Brexit vote (explained here), says the Financial Times. Here\u2019s its take: Fund manager M&amp;G has suspended trading in its \u00a32.5bn Property Portfolio, which is marketed to retail investors, after facing \u201cunusually high and sustained outflows\u201d it blamed on Brexit and the retail downturn. The fund is the first major open-ended property fund to halt redemptions in this way since the crisis in the sector that caused seven funds to \u201cgate\u201d in 2016 following the Brexit referendum \u2014 one of the most high-profile market consequences of the vote to leave the EU. M&amp;G, a London-listed asset manager, said the pressure of outflows had exceeded the speed at which it can sell properties, leading it to suspend any redemption requests arriving after midday on Wednesday. More here: M&amp;G suspends \u00a32.5bn property fund on Brexit and retail woes Signs of distress at M&amp;G\u2019s Property Portfolio fund have been building in recent weeks, leading to today\u2019s suspension. Last month, M&amp;G carried out an unusual \u2018intra-month valuation update\u2019, having spotted a material (downward) move in its assets. This update revealed that M&amp;G\u2019s retail property assets had lost 7.7% of their value, due to a \u201cmarked deterioration\u201d in the retail sector. The company says the rise of internet shopping, and the collapse of several high street chains, were to blame: It is has been well documented that the bricks and mortar retail sector is suffering substantial headwinds. The rise of e-commerce coupled with recent retailer failures is increasing uncertainty across the sector. Retailers are reluctant to pay high rents and investors are decreasing their appetite for retail assets. (Transaction volumes have decreased by 24% compared to the same period in 2018). Even in highly sought after locations such as Bath and Manchester, rents have declined over the last 12 months. More here.... In October, fund industry tracker Morningstar spotted that \u00a32bn of cash had left property funds this year -- with M&amp;G losing \u00a3750m alone. That was an \u201cecho\u201d of the stampede after the Brexit vote, Reuters reported. The BBC\u2019s Simon Gompertz has also heard that the cash reserves in M&amp;G\u2019s property fund have run rather low, forcing today\u2019s suspension. Readers might also remember that a swathe of property funds were temporarily frozen after the EU referendum in 2016. Two weeks after the vote, around \u00a318bn was locked up as asset managers barred the doors, to give time to sell office blocks and shops in order to meet redemption requests. The fundamental problem is that these funds are open-ended, allowing a retail investor to put money in and take it out again as they like. Until too many of them want to cash in at once. Merryn Somerset Webb, editor in chief of Money Week, says there is a structural problem here: The BBC\u2019s Simon Gompertz is tweeting a handy explanation to M&amp;G\u2019s shock property suspension: Shares in M&amp;G have fallen by 2% since it suspended the Property Portfolio fund. M&amp;G is also waiving around a third of the management fee it charges investors -- to address the frustration they\u2019ll feel about being locked into the Property Portfolio. It says: The funds will still be actively managed during suspension, but we understand that being unable to deal in the funds is very frustrating for our customers. In recognition, M&amp;G is waiving 30% of its annual charge, which will end when the funds resume dealing. Suspension will be formally reviewed on a monthly basis and we will inform investors if the level of discount changes. In all other respects, the funds will operate as normal and you will continue to receive income payments, fund reporting and updates as usual This surprise suspension will allow M&amp;G breathing room to raise cash (by selling property) so it can pay people who want to redeem their investment in the Property Portfolio. It says: In accordance with the Fund\u2019s strategy, the suspension will allow the fund managers time to raise cash levels to pay redemptions, whilst ensuring that asset sales are achieved at market prices and investors in the Fund are safeguarded. In all other aspects, the Fund will continue to operate as normal throughout the suspension and customers will continue to receive income payment. NEWSFLASH: One of Britain\u2019s biggest fund managers has just suspended dealing in its multi-billion property fund. M&amp;G has blamed Brexit for the temporary move, saying political uncertainty has made it hard to sell property assets to meet redemption requests from investors in its Property Portfolio. The crisis on the high street -- with many retailers shutting stores -- is another factor. In a letter to investors, M&amp;G says: In recent months, continued Brexit-related uncertainty and ongoing structural shifts in the UK retail sector have prompted unusually high outflows from our property fund for retail investors. Given that these circumstances and deteriorating market conditions have significantly impacted our ability to sell commercial property, we have temporarily suspended dealing in the interests of protecting our customers. The assets owned by the M&amp;G Property Portfolio, such as office buildings and shopping centres, are held for the long term and take time to buy and sell, making it difficult to immediately meet sudden and sustained levels of redemptions. Suspending the funds at this time will allow the fund managers, Fiona Rowley and Justin Upton, time to restore the cash levels by selling assets in an orderly manner and preserve value for our investors. What does it mean? The Property Portfolio holds 91 commercial properties across the UK, and manages assets of \u00a32.54 billion. Funds of its type take money from investors, invest it in commercial property assets, and pay returns from rental payments and capital appreciation. As M&amp;G points out, those properties are hard to sell quickly (unless you accept a firesale price). So if too many investors want to withdraw their money at the same time, the fund can struggle to meet those redemptions. Back on trade.... Donald Trump has told reporters in London that talks with China are going \u201cvery well\u201d. During a press event with German chancellor Angela Merkel, Trump said: Discussions are going very well, and we\u2019ll see what happens. That\u2019s a more upbeat assessment than yesterday, when the president hinted that he might not sign off a deal for another year. This is likely to reassure markets; a cynic might question whether Trump is keen to reverse yesterday\u2019s selloff with some good publicity. But the BIG headlines are on Trump calling Justin Trudeau \u201ctwo-faced\u201d after video emerged showing Canada\u2019s PM laughing about Trump with Boris Johnson, Emmanuel Macron,Mark Rutte and Princess Anne. Boom! Sterling has now hit its highest level against the euro since May 2017. General election speculation has driven the pound up to \u20ac1.182 against the single currency, a 31-month high. Traders are increasingly betting on a Conservative victory next week. The pound is also benefitting from the fact that this morning\u2019s service sector data was less bad than feared (but really not good!). We should remember, though, that one pound was worth \u20ac1.30 before the Brexit referendum.... Ian Strafford-Taylor, CEO of currency and payments firm Equals, suggests the pound is still vulnerable to political drama: \u201cThe pound is now trading at its highest level in over two-years off the back of more election rumours and polls, showing once again how it is at the mercy of British politics. As it stands the pound is at 1.18 against the euro which we haven\u2019t seen since May 2017.\u201d \u201cHowever, the outcome of next week\u2019s general election will not spell the end of the pound\u2019s rocky journey as the future of the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU remains uncertain. We\u2019ve seen in the run-up to past elections that the pound has had a turbulent time, and with more than just a new Prime Minister at stake we shouldn\u2019t get used to these kinds of rates just yet.\u201d Newsflash: Rather fewer jobs were created at American companies last month than expected, a new report shows. The ADP payroll, which measures US employment, has risen by 67,000 in November, much weaker than the 140,000 which Wall Street expected. October\u2019s payroll has been revised lower too, to 121,000 from 125,000. This might be a sign that the US economy is losing momentum; we\u2019ll get a better picture on Friday, when the broader Non-Farm Payroll survey of US labor is released. Sterling is continuing to climb, and is now up a whole cent today at $1.309. That\u2019s a new seven-month high against the US dollar, the strongest position since May 7th. Aviation News: Budget airline Ryanair is planning to close two bases, due to the ongoing delays to Boeing\u2019s 737 MAX jet. Ryanair says it now expects to only receive 10 737 MAX aircraft in time for next summer, not the 20 previously expected. That means it will carry a million fewer passengers -- 156m, not 157m -- and force it to shutter operations at Nuremberg and Stockholm Skavsta. Boeing is still trying to get the 737 Max recertified, following the two fatal crashes blamed on a flawed anti-stall mechanism. John Goldie, FX Dealer at Argentex Group, predicts the pound could rise to at least $1.33 if Johnson wins a majority next week. But victory isn\u2019t assured, so sterling could yet slide back to $1.25, Goldie suggests. It may seem like the political equivalent to Ronny Rosenthal vs. Aston Villa circa-early 90s, but missing an open goal, as the first YouGov MRP suggests it is, seems like an entirely feasible thing for Boris to do. \u201cGiven that the market has already positioned itself to some degree on a Tory majority,... from today\u2019s $1.3000, I\u2019d expect 1.25-1.27 to be the initial fallout for the pound\u2019s nightmare scenario in the early hours of Friday the 13th next week.\u201d Here\u2019s a clip of Rosenthal picking out the crossbar when it was rather easier to score.... Pollsters, such as YouGov, have been giving the Conservatives a solid lead in the polls for months. But Boris Johnson has suggested that the race is \u2018very tight\u2019. That could just be a message designed to get the vote out next Thursday... ...or it could reflect memories of 2017, when Theresa May lost her majority despite beginning her election campaign with a big lead. Wall Street is expected to recover yesterday\u2019s slump too, thanks to Bloomberg\u2019s report that a US-China trade deal could still happen soon. Sterling is also climbing against the euro, hitting a near-nine month high of \u20ac1.1786. That\u2019s because Boris Johnson appears to be on track for victory in next week\u2019s election, says Dean Turner, economist at UBS Wealth Management. But with a week\u2019s campaigning to go, nothing is certain. Turner writes: The election is Boris Johnson\u2019s to lose. However, turnout rates, tactical votes, and the usual campaign trail pitfalls could all swing the final result. \u201cSterling has strengthened on days when the prospects for the Conservative Party have seemingly improved, and vice versa. One interpretation of this phenomenon is that investors favour the prospect of clarity on Brexit. [But] Markets have not reacted much to campaign trail developments so far and sterling volatility has been contained. We retain our bullish medium to long-term view on sterling versus the US dollar and expect that the pound-dollar exchange rate will rise toward $1.38 by the end of next year.\u201d The pound has hit its highest level in seven months, as City traders show increased confidence that Boris Johnson will win next week\u2019s general election. Sterling has jumped to $1.3039, up nearly half a cent, to levels not seen since May 2019. Traders appear to be reacting to the latest Sky News/YouGov poll, which gave the Conservatives a nine-point lead ahead of Thursday\u2019s general election. The poll puts the Tories on 42%, Labour on 33%, the Liberal Democrats are on 12%, and Brexit Party is on 4%, up two points. The City fears another hung parliament, which could mean more deadlock and possible a disorderly Brexit. So this polling is pushing the pound up. Rupert Thompson, Head of Research at Kingswood, says investor confidence in a Conservative victory has grown. Even so, while the polls continue to point to the Conservatives gaining a majority, it is still not a done deal. The danger of an outright Labour victory may be slight but if it did transpire, it would likely cause a slump in the pound. But even at todays levels, the pound is still some 13% weaker than before the Brexit vote three years ago. Thompson explains: So, if market hopes of a Conservatives victory are vindicated, the pound will very likely strengthen further from $1.30 currently to maybe $1.35 or so. Even at $1.35, the pound would remain below the levels seen prior to the 2016 Brexit referendum. This would seem appropriate as, even with a Conservative victory, significant Brexit uncertainty will remain. While Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal would almost certainly be ratified in short order if the Conservatives win, doubts will remain over whether the UK will be able to finalise a trade deal with the EU by the end of the transition period in December 2020. The risk of a No-Deal exit may be much reduced but it has not been eliminated altogether.\u201d In a surprise twist, European stock markets are all rallying.... as hopes of a US-China trade deal grow again. Every index is up, with France, Italy andGermany rallying by over 1%, after unnamed sources claimed that Donald Trump had painted a too-gloomy picture of negotiations yesterday. According to these insiders, a deal could still be reached this month. Bloomberg has the details: The people, who asked not to be identified, said that U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s comments Tuesday downplaying the urgency of a deal shouldn\u2019t be understood to mean the talks were stalling, as he was speaking off the cuff. Recent U.S. legislation seeking to sanction Chinese officials over human-rights issues in Hong Kong and Xinjiang are unlikely to impact the talks, one person familiar with Beijing\u2019s thinking said. U.S. negotiators expect a phase-one deal with China to be completed before American tariffs are set to rise on Dec. 15, the people said. Outstanding issues in the talks include how to guarantee China\u2019s purchases of U.S. agricultural goods and exactly which tariffs to roll back, they added. Andy Bruce of Reuters shows how UK service sector growth has fizzled out this year: If today\u2019s PMIs are accurate, they suggest the UK could be sliding back to the brink of recession. Howard Archer of EY Item Club is revising down his hopes for growth in the fourth quarter of 2019, having seen November\u2019s gloomy PMIs. Even allowing for the fact that the purchasing managers\u2019 surveys are prone to portraying an overly gloomy picture at times of heightened uncertainties, there now looks to be a very real danger that the economy will stagnate in the fourth quarter. We had originally thought the economy could eke out GDP growth of 0.2% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter but this now looks pretty optimistic. Any growth in the economy in the fourth quarter is likely to be pretty dependent on consumers \u2013 who have been the most resilient part of the economy \u2013 spending a decent amount over the critical Christmas period. Duncan Brock, Group Director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, blames Brexit for the drop in UK service sector activity last month. Here\u2019s his take on November\u2019s PMIs: \u201cThe sector was hemmed in with no room for improvement in November by the fastest fall in the pipeline of new work since July 2016, and the biggest drop in export orders since this index began in September 2014. As Brexit nerves continued to affect domestic client decision-making, a veil of silence also descended over European clients in particular who were reluctant to commit until there is more clarity in the UK\u2019s future direction. Tim Moore, economics associate director at IHS Markit, says the UK economy is \u201cstaggering\u201d through the final quarter of the year, with output falling at services companies and factories. \u201cNovember\u2019s PMI surveys collectively suggest that the UK economy is staggering through the final quarter of 2019, with service sector output falling back into decline after a brief period of stabilisation. \u201cLacklustre demand remains centred on business-to- business spending. Service providers have attributed the recent soft patch to delayed decision-making on new projects until greater clarity emerges in relation to the domestic political landscape. Sales to export markets were hard-hit in November, as signalled by the steepest fall in new work from abroad for more than five years. \u201cService providers reported concerns that consumer appetite for big-ticket purchases has begun to falter, while those reliant on consumer footfall and discretionary spending noted the negative impact of unusually wet weather in November. \u201cLower manufacturing production alongside an absence of growth in the service economy means that the IHS Markit/ CIPS Composite Output Index is consistent with UK GDP declining at a quarterly rate of around 0.1%.\u201d Britain\u2019s private sector shrank in November, as the ongoing Brexit uncertainty hurts the country\u2019s dominant services sector. That\u2019s according to data firm Markit, which says its services PMI slumped to 49.3 last month. That\u2019s down from October\u2019s 50, which showed stagnation. That\u2019s not quite as bad as the \u2018flash\u2019 estimate released a couple of weeks ago - but it\u2019s still the worst reading since March. Service sector managers say they suffered a drop in new business last month, with exports shrinking at the fastest rate in five years. Many firms warned that domestic political uncertainty was hurting their business, and dampening consumer spending. We learned on Monday that factory output shrank. Put it together, and it suggests the UK economy is contracting by around 0.1% in the current quarter. More to follow.... Heads-up. Bloomberg is reporting that Washington and Beijing are making progress towards a trade deal. It says: The U.S. and China are moving closer to agreeing on the amount of tariffs that would be rolled back in a phase-one trade deal despite tensions over Hong Kong and Xinjiang, people familiar with the talks said, Bloomberg News reports. That\u2019s not what Donald Trump was suggesting yesterday... perhaps the market slump has unblocked negotiations? The eurozone\u2019s private sector had a lacklustre November. The composite PMI, which measures activity across service sector firms and manufacturers, was unchanged at 50.6 -- showing modest growth. The latest economic data from Hong Kong is an absolute shocker. Private sector activity slumped alarmingly last month, at the fastest rate since the Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus crisis gripped the city, causing hundreds of deaths. Data firm Markit says its Hong Kong PMI, slumped to just 38.5 in November, from 39.3. Any reading over 50 shows growth, and a sub-40 reading suggest a sharp downturn. We already knew that the pro-democracy demonstrations, and the clashes with security forces, pushed Hong Kong into recession in the last quarter. Clearly there\u2019s no sign of recovery. Bernard Aw, Principal Economist at IHS Markit, said: \u201cThe average PMI reading for October and November combined showed the economy on track to see GDP fall by over 5% in the fourth quarter, unless December brings a dramatic recovery. he survey showed that the escalating political unrest saw business activity shrinking at the steepest rate since the survey started in July 1998. This occurred concurrently with the sharpest decline in new sales since the depths of the global financial crisis. The business outlook unsurprisingly remained gloomy, with confidence still stuck among the lowest levels seen in the survey history. In a further sign of pessimism, firms continued to make deep cuts to purchasing activity and inventories, reducing both at a survey record pace.\u201d Away from trade, we have bleak news from the UK high street Fast fashion chain Quiz has warned it could close a swathe of stores, after slumping into a \u00a36.8m loss in the last six month. It blames the decline in visitors to physical stores, and hinted that it could close loss-making outlets when its leases expire. The Chinese government has hit back against Donald Trump\u2019s criticism. At a press briefing, China\u2019s foreign ministry warned that Beijing will take \u201cthe necessary countermeasures\u201d to defend its interests. That sounds like a warning shot to Washington not to implement the tariffs planned for 15 December. After tumbling on Monday and Tuesday, European stock markets are attempting to clamber off the mat this morning. The Stoxx 600 index, which includes the largest EU companies, has gained 0.4% - which recovers a chunk of yesterday\u2019s losses. The FTSE 100, though is flat, with a strengthening pound hitting multinationals. Mohamed Zidan, chief market strategist at ThinkMarkets, says traders remain nervous: Uncertainty is everywhere with negative sentiment among market players after VIX [the volatility index] rebounded from its lowest level in 2019. This rebound and rally was fueled by the unexpected comments by Trump, the only thing which is certain now is that we face a highly volatile environment! Many parents look to their sons-in-law for help, perhaps with a tricky computing problem or a DIY task. Donald Trump, though, is turning to his eldest daughter\u2019s husband to resolve the China trade war! According to Reuters, Jared Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law, has taken a more direct involvement in the negotiations with China over the past two weeks. Kushner does have experience of trade, having worked on the US-Mexico-Canada agreement hammered out a year ago. Reuters says: While the talks have made some progress, these people said the two sides have not yet agreed on the extent to which the United States will remove existing tariffs on Chinese goods and on specific commitments by China to increase purchases of U.S. agriculture products. A White House official confirmed Kushner\u2019s involvement, but declined to provide specific details on the influence he has had on the negotiations. Speaking on condition of anonymity, the official said Kushner has recently met with Cui Tiankai, the Chinese ambassador to the United States. The two have met multiple times since Trump took office, establishing a kind of back-channel relationship, trade experts say. Neil Wilson of Markets.com has sent over some salient points about the trade war situation, and how investors may react. Markets are discounting a trade deal with China being done this year, but it\u2019s still not impossible. The caprice of Trump means, as we have consistently stressed, anything can happen. An EU-US tit-for-tat trade war is a risk but not to be overplayed yet \u2013 most think it can be avoided Global equities have had a good run this year \u2013 there is still plenty of profit taking that could occur in the run-up to Christmas- do we see a repeat of last year and the \u2018nightmare on Wall Street before Christmas\u2019? The market, and Trump, ultimately know the Fed has their back. Pullbacks are to be expected as the market drifts higher and higher Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The season of goodwill may be approaching, but clearly no-one told Donald Trump. The US president has spooked investors around the globe with a series of attacks on other nations, including some close allies, as he threatens to escalate his trade war. Fresh from threatening France with tariffs on cheese and champagne, Trump hinted that he could use trade as a weapon to force NATO members to spend more on defence. But markets were really riled when the president suggested that he might wait to agree a trade deal with China until after the 2020 presidential election - a whole year away. A negotiating tactic, or an admission that talks behind the scenes are floundering? Either way, Trump\u2019s words sent stocks sliding in London and New York last night, with Britain\u2019s FTSE sinking 127 points to a two-month low of 7158. We might see a small recovery this morning, but the mood in the City is rather unfestive. Traders are concerned that America will impose fresh tariffs on China on December 15. Previously, there was hope that Washington would waive them, to help secure a Phase One deal with Beijing. The mood has totally changed in a couple of days, from optimism to pessimism. Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank tells clients this morning: Mr Trump has completely taken the momentum out of financial markets this week and the December 15th date will increasingly become a focal point over the next couple of weeks. Last week the mood music suggested that even if a \u201cphase one\u201d deal hadn\u2019t been reached by then, then there was a good chance tariffs planned to be implemented on that date would be postponed. After the stepping up of negative global tariff rhetoric over the last 48 hours, yesterday\u2019s headlines suggesting that the US is going forward with the December 15 tariffs grabbed the limelight, although markets had already been trading weaker prior to that. Stocks in Asia-Pacific markets have already been hit, extending earlier losses this week. Australia\u2019s S&amp;P/ASX 200, which is vulnerable to a slowdown in China, has shed more than 1%. Commodity prices are also being hammered, on concerns that global growth will be hurt by an escalating trade war. The most-traded nickel contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange has crumbled by over 4%. Gold, though, is rising, as nervous investors look for a safe haven for their cash. Also coming up today Data firm Markit publishes its PMI surveys for the world\u2019s service sector companies today. The \u2018flash\u2019 estimates released two weeks ago were poor, and suggested Britain\u2019s services sector contracted during November. So today\u2019s \u2018final PMI\u2019 report could show that the UK economy is shrinking again.....

As he did at last year\u2019s Nato meeting, Trump has thrown out normal summit protocol and used his appearances with allied leaders to field dozens of questions from the world\u2019s media. Top of the agenda on Wednesday is Turkey\u2019s threat to block a Nato plan for the defence of the Baltics and Poland unless Nato denounces the Syrian Kurds, and by extension endorses the Turkish incursion in October into north-east Syria.

          "bodyText": "Good morning, I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s essential stories. Stakes rise as impeachment inquiry enters new phase The US House intelligence committee voted on Tuesday to adopt the damning, 300-page Trump-Ukraine impeachment report produced by congressional Democrats, which concludes that the president \u201cabused the power of his office for personal and political gain, at the expense of [US] national security\u201d. The 13-9 vote along party lines launches the inquiry into its next phase at the judiciary committee, where Republicans are expected to resort to procedural objections in their efforts to protect Trump. What now? Tom McCarthy breaks down the Democrats\u2019 report into five key takeaways, while Maanvi Singh explains what comes next in the impeachment process. Stephen Miller. Trump is standing by his aide Stephen Miller, despite the damaging fallout from leaked emails that revealed his white nationalist views. Amanda Holpuch asks why Miller\u2019s White House position seems as secure as ever. World leaders appear to joke about Trump at Nato summit It seems world leaders are as shocked and bemused by Trump as the rest of us. A video has emerged from the Nato summit in London, which appears to show Boris Johnson, Justin Trudeau, Emmanuel Macron, Princess Anne and the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, laughing about the US president during a reception at Buckingham Palace. The meeting to mark the 70th anniversary of the Nato alliance began inauspiciously, with tensions on full display between Macron, Trump and Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. Prince Andrew. As a former navy pilot, Prince Andrew would normally be present at a Nato shindig, but the disgraced duke has been stripped of his duties, leaving his mother to host the reception. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s claim not to know Andrew is contradicted by extensive photographic evidence. Harris drops out of 2020 race, citing lack of campaign funds Her campaign launch in Oakland drew a crowd of at least 20,000 and she was hailed as a potential \u201cfemale Obama\u201d, but after several months of steadily sinking poll numbers, Kamala Harris dropped out of the race for the Democratic presidential nomination on Tuesday, telling supporters her campaign \u201csimply doesn\u2019t have the financial resources we need to continue\u201d. David Smith explains why the writing was on the wall for the biggest name to exit the contest so far. Prosecutorial past. As a black woman, Derecka Purnell is more than ready for a black female president. And yet, she says, she felt less solidarity with Harris than with those who suffered under her watch when she was California\u2019s attorney general. China trade deal imperiled by US human rights legislation The House of Representatives on Tuesday overwhelmingly approved a bill demanding the Trump administration toughen its response to human rights abuses in Xinjiang, the Chinese province where more than a million ethnic Uighurs and other Muslim minorities are believed to be detained in internment and political \u201cre-education\u201d camps. The Uighur Act of 2019, a stronger version of a bill that raised Beijing\u2019s hackles when it passed the Senate in September, calls for sanctions on senior Chinese officials. Market tailspin. Asian markets plunged after the bill\u2019s passage, which it is feared will jeopardise the US-China trade talks, just as they were thought to be on the verge of a deal. Cheat sheet At the first day of his defamation trial in Los Angeles, Elon Musk has insisted that when he called Vernon Unsworth a \u201cpedo guy\u201d on Twitter during the Tham Luang cave rescue effort in 2018, he simply meant the British caver was a \u201ccreepy old guy,\u201d not a literal pedophile. The Chicago police chief, Eddie Johnson, has been fired for \u201cethical lapses\u201d just weeks before his retirement, having been found asleep behind the wheel of his SUV after several hours of drinking at a downtown restaurant with a female member of his security detail. The co-founders of Google, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, are stepping down as, respectively, the CEO and president of the search engine\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, leaving the Google CEO, Sundar Pichai, in charge of both Google and Alphabet. The gene editing performed on a pair of Chinese twins in 2018, which the biophysicist He Jiankui claimed would immunise them against HIV, might instead have created unintended mutations, future effects of which on the children are unclear. Must-reads Giorgio Armani: \u2018My values have always been sustainable\u2019 The 85-year-old fashion titan Giorgio Armani is still running his own company, where the search for his successor goes on. And in an era when sustainability is prized, his trend-free approach is at last on-trend. \u201cI\u2019d love for us all to slow down the cycle of collections, and produce less, but of better quality,\u201d he tells Hannah Marriott. Are drone swarms the future of aerial warfare? Solitary surveillance drones and attack drones still account for the vast majority of military drone use. But now armed forces around the world are investing millions in the technology of swarming: drones deployed in squadrons, able to think independently and operate as a pack. Michael Safi reports. How a 1989 Montreal massacre still echoes today Thirty years ago this week, a man who claimed he was \u201cenraged\u201d by feminism shot dead 14 women at the Polytechnique engineering school in Montreal, before killing himself. Far from being a grim memory of a bygone era, writes Tracey Lindeman, the Polytechnique shooting now seems like a foreshadowing of things to come. What we learned from a new book about the first lady The enigmatic Melania Trump is the subject of a new book by the CNN reporter Kate Bennett entitled Free, Melania. So how did Bennett fill all 288 pages? Poppy Noor wonders whether the first lady, who spent five months designing White House Christmas decorations, is vapid or just private. Opinion A new bill introduced in Ohio would demand doctors try to reimplant ectopic pregnancies \u2013 a medical impossibility \u2013 or face the newly invented charge of \u201cabortion murder\u201d. It is dystopian and unconstitutional, says Jill Filipovic \u2013 but it\u2019s a sign of things to come. That\u2019s the plan among abortion opponents: push laws that put women at risk so often, and make those laws so extreme, that overturning Roe v Wade seems like a foregone conclusion. Sport Manchester City have moved back within eight points of Liverpool at the top of the Premier League, breaking a run of disappointing results with a 4-1 win over Burnley at Turf Moor. The Carolina Panthers have fired their all-time most successful head coach, Ron Rivera, after nine seasons, following a four-game losing streak that has the team headed to its third non-playoff season in four years.

Trump also kept up his demand that \u201cdelinquent\u201d Nato states boost their defence spending, warning if they did not do so he would consider imposing US trade sanctions. The sense of disarray, reflecting wider differences about Nato\u2019s future post-cold war purpose, emerged through a series of revealing rolling press conferences hosted by Trump. Late on Tuesday, in a further sign of disunity, footage emerged from a Buckingham Palace reception of leaders including Macron, the British summit host, Boris Johnson, and the Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau appearing to mock Trump\u2019s lengthy media appearances. Johnson largely kept a low profile, but convened a meeting in Downing Street in an effort to forge a common European-Turkish approach to the crisis in north-east Syria where tens of thousands of Syrian Kurds have been displaced because of the October invasion by Turkey and its proxies.

          "bodyText": "Live political reporting continues on Wednesday\u2019s blog: Here\u2019s a recap of today: The House intelligence committee approved an impeachment report voting 13-9 along party lines. The report accuses Trump of abusing his power for personal gain by pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political rivals, and obstructing Congress\u2019 investigation into his actions. The impeachment inquiry is now in the hands of the Judiciary Committee, which is holding its first hearings tomorrow and is expected to draft specific articles of impeachment down the line. Kamala Harris ended her presidential campaign. The California senator could still get a chance to face Trump at his trial if the House votes to impeach him. House minority leader Kevin McCarthy says he has \u201cno concerns\u201d over call records in the impeachment report. The report mentioned that Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani was in contact with Devin Nunes, a Republican representative on the Intelligence Committee leading the impeachment inquiry, as Giuliani began spreading baseless allegations against Joe Biden and his family. \u201cI don\u2019t have a problem with Devin talking to individuals,\u201d McCarthy told reporters. \u201cI have no concerns.\u201d What now? Next steps in the impeachment process Now that the Intelligence Committee has approved its impeachment report, the proceedings will move over to the House Judiciary Committee, which is holding hearings starting tomorrow. Judiciary is then expected to draft the specific articles of impeachment against Trump, today\u2019s report hints could include charges of obstruction of Congress and allegations that Trump comprised national security for personal gain by asking Ukraine to investigate his political rivals. Kamala Harris to Trump: \u2018I\u2019ll see you at your trial\u2019 When Kamala Harris announced she was dropping out of the presidential race earlier today, Donald Trump\u2019s campaign reacted by congratulating Tulsi Gabbard, who often clashed with Harris on the debate stage. Trump tweeted, \u201cToo bad. We will miss you Kamala!\u201d. Harris responded, \u201cDon\u2019t worry\u201d \u2014 she\u2019s still a senator who, if the House votes to impeach the president, will be at the trial deciding whether he should be removed from office. The committee voted 13-9 along party lines to adopt the report. Read key takeaways here: The report alleges that Trump \u201cabused the power of his office for personal and political gain, at the expense of national security\u201d. Though it doesn\u2019t recommend specific articles of impeachment, the document hints at charges of obstruction of justice, among others. Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee also accuse Trump of a cover-up, contending that the president \u201cordered and implemented a campaign to conceal his conduct from the public and frustrate and obstruct the House of Representatives\u2019 impeachment inquiry\u201d. Norman Eisen of the Brookings Institution will question experts at the Judiciary Committee hearing tomorrow, the Washington Post reports. Eisen was the chief ethics lawyer for Barack Obama and US ambassador to the Czech Republic. The judiciary committee is expected to question four law professors during the hearing scheduled for tomorrow. The Republican representative from California pleaded guilty to federal corruption charges relating to his misuse of more than $200,000 in campaign funds. Federal prosecutors had charged him with using campaign money to pay for a $14,000 Italian vacation and other expenses including dog food, groceries, bedding and utilities. \u201cCongressman Duncan D. Hunter violated the trust of his supporters by diverting hundreds of thousands of dollars they donated in good faith to his reelection campaign for personal expenditures,\u201d said assistant U.S. attorney David Leshner said in a statement. Hunter had previously said that he was the victim of a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d. In his plea agreement today, the congressman admitted that he knowingly and willfully stole money to fund their lifestye. Well, that was a full day of news, and my west coast colleague Maanvi Singh will have more updates in the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Democrats on the House intelligence committee released their report on the impeachment inquiry, which accused Trump of both abusing his power to pressure Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and obstructing the investigation into his actions. Kamala Harris suspended her presidential campaign. The California senator was considered a frontrunner in the race earlier this year but saw her polling and fundraising numbers dwindle as she struggled to craft a consistent pitch for her candidacy. A federal appeals court ruled Deutsche Bank and Capitol One must comply with a congressional subpoena seeking Trump\u2019s financial records, but the president\u2019s legal team is likely to appeal the decision. Trump and Emmanuel Macron clashed during a news conference in London, where the French president criticized his US counterpart\u2019s stances on a number of foreign-policy issues -- including outreach to Russia and the state of ISIS. The House judiciary committee will hold its first hearing in the impeachment inquiry tomorrow morning. Maanvi will have more coming up, so stay tuned. AT&amp;T said in a statement that it was \u201crequired by law\u201d to hand over phone records to the House intelligence committee, which were requested as part of the panel\u2019s impeachment inquiry. The phone records showed Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, was in contact with Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House intelligence committee, and an official at the office of management and budget as he started to peddle baseless corruption allegations against Joe Biden. \u201cLike all companies, we are required by law to provide information to government and law enforcement agencies,\u201d a spokesperson for the company said in a statement. \u201cIn all cases, we ensure that requests for assistance are valid and that we act in compliance with the law.\u201d Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, dodged a question about why he was calling an official at the office of management and budget as he was simultaneously pushing for the ouster of Maria Yovanovitch, the former US ambassador to Ukraine. Call records included in the impeachment report from Democrats on the House intelligence committee indicate Giuliani was in contact with not only the OMB official but also Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House intelligence committee. As Trump combats the impeachment inquiry, his personal lawyers have reportedly been sidelined by White House counsel Pat Cipollone and his team of attorneys. The Washington Post reports: In the face of allegations that Trump abused his office for political gain, the White House lawyers are not sharing with his personal attorneys some internal government records central to the inquiry about the pressure the administration put on Ukraine, citing the need to protect executive privilege. The unusual decision to have the White House counsel captain the president\u2019s defense \u2014 at least for now \u2014 departs from how previous presidents have contended with impeachment proceedings and has worried some Trump allies, who believe a multipronged defense would be stronger. It also contrasts sharply with the legal strategy the White House deployed in responding to former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation. In that case, Trump\u2019s personal lawyers led his defense in coordination with select White House attorneys. A lawyer for Lev Parnas, the former associate of Rudy Giuliani\u2019s who aided the Trump lawyer\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukraine to launch investigations into the Democrats, suggested congressman Devin Nunes should have recused himself from the impeachment inquiry. The impeachment report from Democrats on the House intelligence committee showed Parnas and Nunes were in communication as Giuliani began spreading baseless corruption allegations against Joe Biden. Ro Khanna, a Democratic member of the House oversight committee, suggested the judiciary committee should quickly begin drafting articles of impeachment against Trump following the release of the intelligence committee\u2019s report on the inquiry. The judiciary committee will hold its first public hearing in the inquiry tomorrow, which will focus on the constitutional standard for impeaching a president. Adam Schiff has just concluded his news conference following the release of the House intelligence committee\u2019s report on the impeachment inquiry. The committee chairman concluded his remarks by answering a reporter\u2019s question about Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the panel who was apparently in contact with Rudy Giuliani as the president\u2019s personal lawyer began to peddle baseless corruption allegations against Joe Biden. Schiff acknoweldged it was \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d that there \u201cmay have been members of Congres complicit in\u201d trying to dig up dirt on Biden, but the chairman warned there was still much left to uncover about those communications. \u201cOur focus is on the president\u2019s conduct first and foremost,\u201d Schiff said, suggesting it may be up to others -- possibly the House ethics committee? -- to investigate the actions of some of Trump\u2019s allies. Adam Schiff said he would \u201ccontinue to reserve judgement\u201d on whether Trump should be impeached and removed from office, even though his panel just released a report accusing the president of abusing his power to have a political rival investigated. But the intelligence committee chairman did acknowledge he was \u201cgravely concerned\u201d about the allegations outlined in the impeachment report, warning that Trump\u2019s actions could \u201cinvite further corruption of our elections.\u201d Adam Schiff encouraged his Republican colleagues to seriously consider the allegations against Trump, warning that their dismissal of the inquiry could set a dangerous precedent for future presidents. \u201cTo my Republican colleagues, they need to consider when we have a Democratic president, are they willing to say to their oversight that the president can simply refuse?\u201d the House intelligence committee said. But Schiff emphasized Democrats would not abandon the investigation, despite Republican opposition. \u201cI firmly believe that if one party relinquishes its responsibility to the constitution and to their oath, it does not relieve us of our obligation to the same,\u201d Schiff said. House intelligence committee chairman Adam Schiff said his panel\u2019s report on the impeachment inquiry \u201cchronicles a scheme\u201d by Trump to pressure Ukraine into \u201cdoing the president\u2019s political dirty work.\u201d The California Democrat asserted Trump had leveraged a potential White House meeting and military assistance to pursue his political agenda. \u201cThese were things that Ukraine desperately wanted and needed,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cThis is not about Ukraine. This is about our democracy,\u201d the chairman added, accusing Trump of \u201cbetraying that oath that he took to the constitution to protect our country and defend its institutions.\u201d Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee, is holding a news conference following the release of his panel\u2019s report on the impeachment inquiry. The impeachment report from Democrats on the House intelligence committee outlines frequent communication between Rudy Giuliani and the White House as the president\u2019s personal lawyer pushed for the ouster of Maria Yovanovitch, the former US ambassador to Ukraine. Yovanovitch was recalled from her post in May, even though the deputy secretary of state told her she had done nothing wrong in the role. The editor-in-chief of the Hill said the newspaper was launching a \u201cmeticulous review\u201d of John Solomon\u2019s columns after the impeachment report from Democrats on the House intelligence committee revealed the former opinion writer was in frequent contact with former Giuliani associate Lev Parnas. The impeachment report from Democrats on the House intelligence committee lays out the findings from their hearings but does not offer an explicit recommendation on articles of impeachment, instead leaving that matter up to the House judiciary commitee. The judiciary committee will hold its first public hearing of the inquiry tomorrow, and it will focus on the constitutional standard for impeaching a president. The White House slammed the impeachment report from Democrats on the House intelligence committee, saying the document \u201creads like the ramblings of a basement blogger.\u201d \u201cAt the end of a one-sided sham process, Chairman Schiff and the Democrats utterly failed to produce any evidence of wrongdoing by President Trump,\u201d press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement. \u201cThis report reflects nothing more than their frustrations. Chairman Schiff\u2019s report reads like the ramblings of a basement blogger straining to prove something when there is evidence of nothing.\u201d Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House intelligence committee, was repeatedly in contact with Rudy Giulaini as the president\u2019s personal lawyer started spreading baseless corruption allegations against Joe Biden, according to the impeachment report. CNN reported late last month that Nunes, who has been one of the president\u2019s most ardent defenders against the impeachment inquiry, met with a former Ukrainian prosecutor in an effort to get dirt on Biden. According to the impeachment report from Democrats on the House intelligence committee, John Solomon, a former opinion writer for the Hill newspaper who wrote misleading op-eds about Ukraine, was in frequent contact with Lev Parnas, a former associate of Rudy Giuliani\u2019s who is now facing federal campaign-finance charges. The impeachment report from Democrats on the House intelligence committee levels two main charges against Trump: that he \u201cConditioned a White House Meeting and Military Aid to Ukraine on a Public Announcement of Investigations Beneficial to his Reelection Campaign\u201d and that he \u201cObstructed the Impeachment Inquiry by Instructing Witnesses and Agencies to Ignore Subpoenas for Documents and Testimony.\u201d \u201cThe President demanded that the newly-elected Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, publicly announce investigations into a political rival that he apparently feared the most, former Vice President Joe Biden, and into a discredited theory that it was Ukraine, not Russia, that interfered in the 2016 presidential election,\u201d the report\u2019s executive summary says. \u201cTo compel the Ukrainian President to do his political bidding, President Trump conditioned two official acts on the public announcement of the investigations: a coveted White House visit and critical U.S. military assistance Ukraine needed to fight its Russian adversary.\u201d The impeachment report from Democrats on the House intelligence committee runs 300 pages long and outlines the lawmakers\u2019 argument that Trump abused the power of the presidency to pressure Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and the 2016 election. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s scheme subverted U.S. foreign policy toward Ukraine and undermined our national security in favor of two politically motivated investigations that would help his presidential reelection campaign,\u201d the report\u2019s executive summary says. The Democrats on the House intelligence committee have released their report on the impeachment inquiry. \u201cThe impeachment inquiry into Donald J. Trump, the 45th President of the United States, uncovered a months-long effort by President Trump to use the powers of his office to solicit foreign interference on his behalf in the 2020 election,\u201d the report says. With the announcement that she is suspending her presidential campaign, Kamala Harris is poised to become a key voice for Senate Democrats during the expected trial on whether to remove Trump from office. Harris serves on the Senate judiciary committee and has become well known for the tough questions she poses to Trump administration officials, including former attorney general Jeff Sessions. Trump\u2019s reelection campaign reacted to the news that Kamala Harris was ending her White House bid by congratulating Tulsi Gabbard, who repeatedly clashed with Harris on the debate stage. Presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg, who eclipsed Kamala Harris in polling in recent months, celebrated the California senator\u2019s long career and predicted she would continue to play a vital role in the Democratic Party. Kamala Harris\u2019 opponents applauded her as a \u201ctrailblazer\u201d and a \u201clifelong fighter for opportunity and justice\u201d following the California senator\u2019s announcement that she would not continue with her presidential campaign. With Kamala Harris\u2019 withdrawal from the Democratic presidential race, six candidates are now expected to participate in the December debate -- although there are nine days left to qualify. As one commentator pointed out, without Harris on the stage, all the candidates who have already qualified -- Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar and Tom Steyer -- are white. Kamala Harris has just sent a tweet sharing the email to supporters announcing her decision to withdraw from the presidential race. \u201cI want to be clear: although I am no longer running for President, I will do everything in my power to defeat Donald Trump and fight for the future of our country and the best of who we are,\u201d Harris wrote. \u201cI know you will too. So let\u2019s do that together.\u201d In an email to supporters announcing her decision, Kamala Harris said her campaign lacked the financial resources to continue with the bid. The California senator lagged behind fellow candidates like Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg in third-quarter fundraising. Harris wrote in her email: Eleven months ago at the launch of our campaign in Oakland I told you all: \u2018I am not perfect. But I will always speak with decency and moral clarity and treat all people with dignity and respect. I will lead with integrity. I will speak the truth.\u2019 And that\u2019s what I have tried to do every day of this campaign. So here\u2019s the truth today. I\u2019ve taken stock and looked at this from every angle, and over the last few days have come to one of the hardest decisions of my life. My campaign for president simply doesn\u2019t have the financial resources we need to continue. I\u2019m not a billionaire. I can\u2019t fund my own campaign. And as the campaign has gone on, it\u2019s become harder and harder to raise the money we need to compete. In good faith, I can\u2019t tell you, my supporters and volunteers, that I have a path forward if I don\u2019t believe I do. So, to you my supporters, it is with deep regret -- but also with deep gratitude -- that I am suspending my campaign today. The timing of Kamala Harris\u2019 announcement makes more sense in the context of the California presidential primary, given that the senator only had a few days left to drop out without appearing on the state\u2019s primary ballot. The Guardian has confirmed Kamala Harris is ending her presidential campaign, but the California senator has not yet posted a video announcing her decision. Joe Biden, campaigning in Iowa, said he had \u201cmixed emotions\u201d about the news, calling Harris a \u201cfirst-rate candidate.\u201d Harris\u2019 biggest campaign moment came when she criticized Biden\u2019s past opposition to busing during the first Democratic debates. Kamala Harris has not yet confirmed she is dropping out of the presidential race, but her husband just shared this photo as reports indicate the California senator has informed her staff of the decision. Kamala Harris\u2019 niece has just shared this tweet amid reports she is ending her White House campaign. A video announcing the decision is reportedly forthcoming from the California senator. Kamala Harris canceled a fundraiser with major donors in New York earlier today, citing a \u201cpersonal matter\u201d and not elaborating on a possible rescheduling date for the event. CNBC reported: The event, which was scheduled to take place on Tuesday at the Paul Weiss law firm, was suddenly dropped due to what was described by the campaign as a \u2018personal matter,\u2019 according to people familiar with the situation. No date was given for rescheduling. Donors were informed of the decision earlier Tuesday. An invitation shows that the fundraiser was expected to draw some of Harris\u2019 top bundlers, including hedge fund executive Marc Lasry, financier Blair Effron and Paul Weiss chairman Brad Karp. All three are listed as members of Harris\u2019 finance committee. Also slated to attend was Citigroup executive Ray McGuire and music industry investor Matt Pincus. Senator Kamala Harris has reportedly dropped out of the presidential race amid dwindling polling and fundraising numbers. The California senator was considered a frontrunner in the race early on, but she struggled to catch fire in a crowded field. Representative Jim Himes, a Democrat on the House intelligence committee, said the panel\u2019s report on the impeachment inquiry runs hundreds of pages long, but the Connecticut lawmaker would not say whether it recommends specific articles of impeachment against Trump. The House intelligence committee plans to release its report on the impeachment inquiry, which is backed by the panel\u2019s Democrats, this evening, according to CNN. CNN reports: The report from the House Intelligence Committee makes the Democrats\u2019 case for impeachment, weaving a narrative about Trump\u2019s handling of Ukraine, including with exhibits and phone logs, the sources said. The report will also compare Trump\u2019s lack of cooperation with Congress with the cooperation in past administrations to argue that this President has engaged in unprecedented stonewalling. The committee\u2019s report, which is expected to be released publicly Tuesday evening, will serve as the backbone of the Democrats\u2019 impeachment proceedings against the President. The committee is expected to vote to approve it on Tuesday evening to send it to the House Judiciary Committee, where it is expected to serve as the basis of articles of impeachment that would be drafted by that panel in the coming days. The report\u2019s public release will come one day after Republicans on the House intelligence committee released their own 123-page report, which defended Trump\u2019s communications with Ukraine and claimed the impeachment inquiry was nothing more than a partisan stunt. Meanwhile, it looks like the sentencing of Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in 2017, has been pushed back until at least mid-January as a federal judge has granted the former official permission to travel to South Korea later this month. Senator John Kennedy, who has repeatedly suggested that Ukraine may have meddled in the 2016 election, dodged a question about the baseless accusation as he entered an elevator with Mitt Romney, who said in a statement today that he has seen \u201cno evidence\u201d of Ukrainian election interference. Senate Republicans are offering a range of answers on whether they believe the accusation that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election, a baseless claim peddled by the Kremlin and echoed by Trump and some of his allies. Some GOP senators have argued Ukraine might have meddled in the election alongside other countries like Russia, but a handful of lawmakers -- including Utah senator Mitt Romney -- have placed the blame for 2016 election interference squarely on the Kremlin, as the US intelligence community has. Jay Sekulow, a lawyer for the president, has just issued a statement insisting the congressional subpoena for Trump\u2019s financial records is \u201cinvalid as issued.\u201d The statement comes after a federal appeals court ruled that Deutsche Bank and Capitol One must hand over documents in connection to the subpoena, but Sekulow suggested Trump\u2019s legal team may appeal the decision to the Supreme Court. David Hale, the undersecretary of state who testified last month during the public impeachment hearings, told the Senate foreign relations committee that he has seen no evidence of Ukraine having meddled in the 2016 election. Trump\u2019s Republican allies have floated the baseless claim that Ukraine interfered in the election to substantiate the president\u2019s request for an investigation into the conspiracy theory. But Hale pointed out that the US intelligence community has firmly concluded Russia interfered in the 2016 election, and Fiona Hill, the former top White House expert on Russia, testified during the impeachment hearings that this baseless accusation against Ukraine is a \u201cfictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services.\u201d Asked whether he had any reason to disagree with Hill, Hale said, \u201cI do not.\u201d Trump talked to reporters three times today -- appearing alongside Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg, French President Emmanuel Macron and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. All together, the US president spoke to the press for more than two hours today. Meanwhile, Republicans on the House oversight committee are keeping up their messaging campaign against the impeachment inquiry by ... photo-shopping chairman Adam Schiff\u2019s face into a poster for the movie \u201cBack to the Future.\u201d Speaking to reporters just now in London, Trump called Schiff a \u201cmaniac,\u201d a \u201cderanged human being\u201d and a \u201cvery sick man\u201d for his handling of the impeachment inquiry. Trump has now wrapped up his news conference with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, during which the US president announced the June G7 summit would be held at Camp David. The president\u2019s acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, had previously announced the summit would be held at Trump\u2019s resort in Doral, Florida, but that decision was quickly reversed amid intense criticism from Democrats and Republicans. Ironically, when Mulvaney announced the initial choice of Doral, he claimed that the past G7 site of Camp David had been a \u201ccomplete disaster.\u201d \u201cIn fact, I understand the folks who participated in it hated it and thought it was a miserable place to have the G7,\u201d Mulvaney said at the time. Sitting next to the Canadian prime minister in London, Trump railed against the House impeachment inquiry, calling intelligence committee chairman Adam Schiff a \u201cderanged human being.\u201d Echoing past comments, the president insisted Democrats have gone \u201ccrazy\u201d over impeachment and said they should be \u201cashamed\u201d of themselves for how they have handled the inquiry. Trump just claimed to reporters that he does not follow the stock market after the Dow hit a one-month low following the president\u2019s comments that he does not have a \u201cdeadline\u201d for reaching a trade deal with China. In reality, Trump has repeatedly boasted about the state of the stock market and has demanded credit for its rallies while shaking off responsibility for its trade-related tumbles. Sitting alongside Justin Trudeau, Trump said Canada must increase its financial contribution to Nato, suggesting the country should be put on a \u201cpayment plan\u201d to up its defense spending for the alliance. The Canadian prime minister pushed back by pointing out his country has increased its Nato spending by 70% in recent years and insisted Canada is a key partner in the alliance. Trump told reporters that he thought the initial question about supporting the protesters in Iran pertained to financial support, hence his surpising answer that he did not back the demonstrators. \u201cWe do support them totally and have supported them from the beginning,\u201d Trump said at the start of his news conference with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in London. Trump\u2019s clean-up of his earlier comments aligns the president with secretary of state Mike Pompeo, who has said the US backs the protesters and has tried to keep online communications open in Iran depsite the government\u2019s efforts to shut down the internet. Trump has just sent a tweet saying he supports the protesters in Iran, less than an hour after the US president said during a news conference with Emmanuel Macron that he did not back the demonstrators. During his news conference with the French president, Trump was asked whether he supported the protesters, as his secretary of state has expressed. \u201cI don\u2019t want to comment on that, but the answer\u2019s no. But I don\u2019t want to comment on that,\u201d Trump replied. If the federal appeals court\u2019s ruling stands, House Democrats could have unprecedented insight into Trump\u2019s business dealings. However, the president\u2019s legal team is likely not done trying to fight the order. A federal appeals court has ruled that Deutsche Bank and Capitol One must comply with a congressional subpoena for Trump\u2019s financial records, dealing another legal blow to the president. However, the scope of the banks\u2019 disclosures remains unclear, and Trump\u2019s legal team could still appeal the case to the Supreme Court. Trump\u2019s press conference with Emmanuel Macron has just wrapped up, during which the French president repeatedly challenged the US leader on a number of foreign-policy issues. But Trump stuck by his controversial stances -- arguing, for example, that there was a benefit to communicating with Russia because the idea is popular at his campaign rallies. Sitting next to Trump, French President Emmanuel Macron repeatedly criticized the US leader for his stances on a number of foreign-policy issues, particularly his welcoming of Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan after the Turkish president launched a violent military oepration in Syria. Trump shocked reporters in London when he responded to a question about whether he supports the protesters in Iran, who have been violently repressed by their country\u2019s government. The US president initially said he did not want to comment on the situation in Iran but then added offhandedly that he did not support the protesters. Secretary of state Mike Pompeo said yesterday that the US was supporting the protesters by trying to keep online communications open, despite the Iranian government\u2019s efforts to shut down the internet. Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron are speaking to reporters in London as they meet during the Nato summit, and the two world leaders have repeatedly clashed on everything from Russia to the return of Islamic State fighters who have European citizenship. Trump was insisting European countries need to take back control of those fighters and he joked to Macron, \u201cWould you like some nice ISIS fighters? I could give them to you.\u201d Macron responded by noting only a small percentage of ISIS fighters originally come from Europe. Trump replied, \u201cThis is why he\u2019s a great politician because that was one of the greatest non-answers I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d Tom Steyer\u2019s campaign said the billionaire activist has qualified for the December Democratic debate, making him the seventh presidential candidate to meet both the polling and donor requirements to participate. \u201cAfter terrific performances in the last two debates and a tremendous amount of earned media over the last month, Tom continues his surge in the early state polls which has led to an increased amount of donors over the last few weeks,\u201d his campaign manager, Heather Hargreaves, said in a statement. Steyer will join Joe Biden, Elizbaeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar on the debate stage. Tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang only needs one more qualifying poll to make the cut, and he has nine days to get it. However, it\u2019s looking increasingly likely that about half of the Democratic presidential field will fail to qualify for the next debate -- which could pressure more candidates to withdraw from the race, as Montana governor Steve Bullock and former Pennsylvania congressman Joe Sestak both did in recent days. Good morning, live blog readers! Donald Trump is at the Nato summit in London striking fear into stockbrokers\u2019 hearts and insulting world leaders (as we\u2019ve come to expect), but the impeachment inquiry is continuing unabated as the president is abroad. The House intelligence committee is expected to publicy release its report on the impeachment inquiry today. The report will convey Democrats\u2019 argument that Trump abused the power of the presidency by trying to pressure Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and the 2016 election. Republicans on the committee insist the inquiry is just an outgrowth of Democrats\u2019 political animus toward Trump, who did nothing wrong in his communications with Ukraine. This viewpoint was articulated in a report released yesterday by the Republican minority of the intelligence committee. \u201cThe fundamental disagreement apparent in the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry is a difference of world views and a discomfort with President Trump\u2019s policy decisions,\u201d that report said. The president\u2019s allies are pushing back against the investigations of his administration in other ways as well. The Washington Post reported last night that attorney general William Barr has told associates he does not agree with the justice department inspector general\u2019s finding that the FBI was justified to launch the Russia investigation. However, as the House gets closer and closer to an impeachment vote, Trump\u2019s allies may soon run out of options for protecting the president. Here\u2019s what else the blog is keeping its eye on: Trump will meet with French President Emmanuel Macron and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in London before a Nato leaders reception at Buckingham Palace. David Hale, the undersecretary of state who testified during the public impeachment hearings, will appear before the Senate foreign relations committee at 10 a.m. ET. Joe Biden will continue his bus tour in Iowa. The blog will have much more coming up, so stay tuned.",

But they have also been anxious for him to respond to Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s much-repeated allegation (which clearly has some traction with the public) that a Trump trade deal would pose a threat to the NHS, particularly via possible higher drugs prices. As a result, in an extended press briefing this morning, Trump staged an intervention in the election - while claiming to be doing the opposite. The intervention came when he was asked if the NHS should be included in trade negotiations. He replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>No, not at all, I have nothing to do with it. Never even thought about it, honestly ...</p> \n   <p>I don\u2019t even know where that rumour started. We have absolutely nothing to do with it and we wouldn\u2019t want to if you handed it to us on a silver platter, we want nothing to do with it.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This was, of course, disingenuous because one person who started the rumour was Trump himself, when he said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jun/04/donald-trump-president-visit-uk-press-conference-may-visit-labour-calls-us-president-sexual-predator-and-racist-live-news?page=with:block-5cf68c758f08d4e6b70ddf37#block-5cf68c758f08d4e6b70ddf37\">in a press conference in the UK in June</a> that \u201ceverything is on the table ... NHS or anything else\u201d. Given Trump\u2019s reputation when it comes to honesty, his assurance may have little or no impact on public opinion, and it ignores the granular detail of how a trade deal could impact negatively on British healthcare (which almost certainly would not involve US companies buying NHS hospitals). But, for the Conservatives, it is at least a quote they can use.</p> \n  <p>On broader electoral issues, Trump ostensibly avoided the temptation to take sides. He claimed that he had \u201cno thoughts\u201d on the election and, although he said he thought Johnson was \u201cvery capable\u201d, he also said he could work with Corbyn if he became prime minister. Asked about this, he replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I can work with anybody. I\u2019m a very easy person to work with. You wouldn\u2019t believe it.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This was also disingenuous because, only a few weeks ago, Trump had very clear thoughts on the election: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/31/trump-says-johnson-and-farage-could-form-unstoppable-force\">he thought Corbyn would be \u201cbad\u201d for the UK, and he wanted Johnson to align with Nigel Farage</a>. In a rare display of self-awareness that helped to explain his relative reticence, Trump also told the press conference today that intervening in the election would not be helpful because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/dec/03/general-election-nhs-staff-lead-protests-as-trump-visits-london-for-nato-talks-live?page=with:block-5de653958f08f78465b4a093#block-5de653958f08f78465b4a093\">in Britain \u201cthey may not like me\u201d</a>. </p> \n  <p>During his day in London Trump also managed to send share prices falling around the world, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/03/trump-says-china-us-trade-deal-could-wait-until-after-2020-election\">by saying a trade deal with China might be more than a year away</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/03/trump-macron-brain-dead-nato-remarks\">to traduce the French president, Emmanuel Macron</a> (for being rude about Nato, of all things - even Trump himself once called it \u201cobsolete\u201d).

Corbyn said, if he got the chance, he would deliver a message to Trump. Asked what he would say, he replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I will say: \u2018Welcome to this country. I hope you\u2019ll understand how precious our national health service is, and in any future trade relationship with the USA, none of our public services are on the table, none of our public services are for sale and investor state protection is not acceptable to our government when we\u2019ve won this election.\u2019</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Corbyn also stressed that he would be polite. He was \u201calways polite\u201d, he said.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Corbyn said he would ask Trump to change the guidelines issued to his trade negotiators to reflect the fact that the NHS was not on the table. </strong>Asked what he would say to Trump if Trump told him that he did not want access to the NHS, Corbyn replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I will say: \u2018Thank you very much. I assume that will now be the basis of your administration\u2019s talks with our Department of [International] Trade.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>But Corbyn also expressed scepticism about the assurances that Trump has given on this subject today.</strong> Asked about Trump saying this morning that the US would not want access to the NHS, even if that were offered \u201con a silver platter\u201d (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/dec/03/general-election-nhs-staff-lead-protests-as-trump-visits-london-for-nato-talks-live?page=with:block-5de634ef8f08f78465b49f49#block-5de634ef8f08f78465b49f49\">10.15am),</a> Corbyn replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I\u2019m pleased that he said that. But if that\u2019s the case, why have these talks gone on for two years. Why have they been kept secret? Why was, on a freedom of information request, the document only produced in redacted form? And eventually the full text has been released.</p> \n   <p>And I think there [are] very, very legitimate grounds for very, very serious concerns.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Corbyn was referring to the talks between UK and US officials described in detail <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/27/leaked-papers-prove-tories-want-to-sell-off-nhs-claims-corbyn\">in confidential government papers</a> that were leaked and released by Labour last week. When it was put to him that those papers did not contain evidence of British officials agreeing that the US would get access to the NHS in a trade deal, Corbyn replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Clearly [the officials] were working under authority. And clearly there was a serious discussion about the relationship with access to public services and investor state protection, which is a very bad thing, in my view, because it gives multinational companies the power to sue national governments in an international legal process. That\u2019s already happened with Philip Morris tobacco and various governments around the world. I don\u2019t think we want any of that written into any trade agreement we have with another country. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Corbyn dismissed the significance of the claim in the Conservative election manifesto that \u201cwhen we are negotiating trade deals, the NHS will not be on the table.\u201d </strong>Asked about this assurance, Corbyn replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Well, it absolutely is on the table because they\u2019ve discussed patent extensions. And patents are the things that give us the very high prices for specialist medicines. And if we reduce the length of patents or, if there has been a public investment in those patent researches, we buy that patent, then we get cheaper medicines. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This is what the Tory manifesto says in full on this point:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>When we are negotiating trade deals, the NHS will not be on the table. The price the NHS pays for drugs will not be on the table. The services the NHS provides will not be on the table.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Corbyn said, if he became prime minister, he would be respectful towards Trump in their dealings. Asked how he would treat the US president, he replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I will treat him with respect, as I would everybody else. And also make very clear that any trade relationship with the USA will not involve investor protection for US companies and will absolutely not involve access to our public services, and crucially, of course, our national health service.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"089d7dc1c75b0badea93c59eee5a956760fe9a52\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/089d7dc1c75b0badea93c59eee5a956760fe9a52/0_30_5645_3387/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn posing for a selfie on a visit to SOAS this morning.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Corbyn posing for a selfie on a visit to SOAS this morning.<br></span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Smith/The Guardian</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-03T14:50:49.889Z\">at 2.50pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5de66ab28f08f78465b4a195\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-03T14:02:14.900Z\">2.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>And this is from my colleague <strong>Rowena Mason, </strong>who was with Boris Johnson in Salisbury this morning.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/rowenamason/status/1201831122029699072\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Perhaps unwisely Boris Johnson now in front of a \u201cSimply Nuts\u201d sign <a href=\"https://t.co/ADQzYgdtoy\">pic.twitter.com/ADQzYgdtoy</a></p>\u2014 Rowena Mason (@rowenamason) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rowenamason/status/1201831122029699072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 3, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-03T14:23:06.634Z\">at 2.23pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5de6695e8f0829bc521b5a78\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-03T13:56:03.218Z\">1.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4766822a463f6e3a4df497df380281f72d03b7c0\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4766822a463f6e3a4df497df380281f72d03b7c0/0_90_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson visiting a Christmas market in Salisbury this morning.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson visiting a Christmas market in Salisbury this morning.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: WPA Pool/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5de668828f08bf648cb22fb7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-03T13:52:25.977Z\">1.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>From CNN\u2019s <strong>Daniel Dale</strong></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ddale8/status/1201861357244567553\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Here's Trump's public schedule for today.

          "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from us for this evening. If you\u2019d like to read more on today\u2019s Nato reception, my colleague Caroline Davies has the full story: And Andrew Sparrow has put together this detailed summary of the day\u2019s politics news: The faking of an email that was used to back up the Lib Dems\u2019 claims in a row with a news website over an embarrassing story was \u201cutterly unacceptable\u201d, the party\u2019s leader has said. A senior member of the party\u2019s campaign team was suspended over the debacle last week. This evening, the Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson has said: Clearly, as has been reported, that there was an email that was sent ... which was inaccurate, which was faked and that is not acceptable. There is an investigation. The member of staff has been suspended, and I am not going to comment further on staffing matters. There is an investigation. That particular incident is absolutely unacceptable and that\u2019s why we have taken the swift action and are investigating. We reported earlier that the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, had said he was planning to confront Donald Trump over the plausibility of his assurances on the NHS during a reception at Buckingham Palace this evening (see: 2.44pm). There was some skepticism about whether or not Corbyn would be able to address the subject with Trump and the Guardian now understands he did not get the opportunity to do so. Donald Trump and his wife, Melania Trump, were left out in the cold outside No 10 as the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, were invited to go inside ahead of them. The world leaders arrived at the Downing Street reception together in the US president\u2019s car, the Beast, this evening. A choir ran through Christmas songs as guests began arriving, including Hark the Herald Angel, Walking in a Winter Wonderland and We Wish You a Merry Christmas. Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary general, had arrived about 20 minutes earlier, followed shortly after by Justin Trudeau, then Angela Merkel, who stopped to admire the choir. The US president and first lady paused on the steps of No 10 for photographs but did not speak before entering. The prime minister has met the German chancellor and the French and Turkish presidents this evening to discuss Syria, Libya and counter-terrorism. A Downing Street spokesman said: The leaders discussed the broad strategic, economic and defence partnerships between their countries and agreed the importance of further deepening these, including through Nato. On Syria, the leaders agreed that humanitarian access, including cross-border, must be ensured and that a UN needs assessment should form the basis for getting aid to those who require it in the north-east. The leaders said they would work to create the conditions for the safe, voluntary and sustainable return of refugees and that the fight must be continued against terrorism in all its forms. They also agreed that all attacks against civilians in Syria, including those in Idlib, must stop. They noted their support to the constitutional committee process and the importance of UNSCR 2254. On Libya, the leaders reiterated their support for SRSG Salame [special envoy to Libya, Ghassan Salam\u00e9] to move forward a Libyan-owned political process, facilitated by the United Nations and supported by the Berlin Format. The leaders agreed that meetings in this format should continue. This is Kevin Rawlinson taking over the liveblog for the evening. My colleague Vikram Dodd has this report on the damning comments of the former head of counter-terrorism at Scotland Yard, Robert Quick, who attacks the prime minister for peddling \u201ccliches\u201d about sentencing laws after last Friday\u2019s terror attack. Quick says cuts to police numbers have played the greater role in jeopardising public safety. Donald Trump has sought to counter Labour claims that the NHS would be at risk under a UK-US trade deal by saying he would not want it even \u201con a silver platter\u201d. With the election just over a week away, the Tories have been worried that any overt endorsement of Boris Johnson by the US president could backfire. But they have also been anxious for him to respond to Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s much-repeated allegation (which clearly has some traction with the public) that a Trump trade deal would pose a threat to the NHS, particularly via possible higher drugs prices. As a result, in an extended press briefing this morning, Trump staged an intervention in the election - while claiming to be doing the opposite. The intervention came when he was asked if the NHS should be included in trade negotiations. He replied: No, not at all, I have nothing to do with it. Never even thought about it, honestly ... I don\u2019t even know where that rumour started. We have absolutely nothing to do with it and we wouldn\u2019t want to if you handed it to us on a silver platter, we want nothing to do with it. This was, of course, disingenuous because one person who started the rumour was Trump himself, when he said in a press conference in the UK in June that \u201ceverything is on the table ... NHS or anything else\u201d. Given Trump\u2019s reputation when it comes to honesty, his assurance may have little or no impact on public opinion, and it ignores the granular detail of how a trade deal could impact negatively on British healthcare (which almost certainly would not involve US companies buying NHS hospitals). But, for the Conservatives, it is at least a quote they can use. On broader electoral issues, Trump ostensibly avoided the temptation to take sides. He claimed that he had \u201cno thoughts\u201d on the election and, although he said he thought Johnson was \u201cvery capable\u201d, he also said he could work with Corbyn if he became prime minister. Asked about this, he replied: I can work with anybody. I\u2019m a very easy person to work with. You wouldn\u2019t believe it. This was also disingenuous because, only a few weeks ago, Trump had very clear thoughts on the election: he thought Corbyn would be \u201cbad\u201d for the UK, and he wanted Johnson to align with Nigel Farage. In a rare display of self-awareness that helped to explain his relative reticence, Trump also told the press conference today that intervening in the election would not be helpful because in Britain \u201cthey may not like me\u201d. During his day in London Trump also managed to send share prices falling around the world, by saying a trade deal with China might be more than a year away, and to traduce the French president, Emmanuel Macron (for being rude about Nato, of all things - even Trump himself once called it \u201cobsolete\u201d). So, on the Trump mayhem front, the UK got off quite lightly. Corbyn has cast doubt on the plausibility of Trump\u2019s NHS assurances and said he intends to take the matter up with the president at a reception at Buckingham Palace early this evening. As I write, it is not clear yet whether the two men will be able to have a proper conversation \u2013 or whether their encounter (if it happens at all) will not get beyond pleasantries. Channel 4 has been cleared of bias by the media regulator after replacing Johnson with a melting block of ice during last week\u2019s leadership debate on the climate crisis. Nigel Farage has claimed that Johnson only became prime minister because he launched the Brexit party this year out of anger about Theresa May\u2019s handling of Brexit. He may be right. A new biography of May claims Johnson has said something similar in private. Corbyn has apologised for antisemitic incidents involving Labour party members and said he was dealing with the issue. A host of leading cultural figures, including the actors Steve Coogan, Mark Rylance and Julie Christie, the grime artist Kano and the writer and environmentalist Naomi Klein, have united to back Corbyn and praised Labour for prioritising \u201cpeople and planet over profit\u201d. That\u2019s all from me for this evening. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is now taking over. The BBC\u2019s Andrew Neil has said the Tories are still refusing to suggest a date for his proposed interview with Boris Johnson. These are from my colleague Damien Gayle, who is covering the anti-Trump protest in London this afternoon. And Sky\u2019s Sam Coates has the latest YouGov polling. Here are three polling-related stories/blogs that are worth reading. The Evening Standard says polling in London shows that Labour is increasing support. It says: In a big squeeze on smaller parties as polling day draws closer, Labour appears to be taking votes from the Liberal Democrats and Brexit party, which have both lost support. Labour\u2019s lead in the capital has improved to 17 points, according to the YouGov survey commissioned by Queen Mary University of London\u2019s Mile End Institute, and its leader\u2019s image has improved. But the poll marks a significant decline compared with its 22-point lead in the capital at the 2017 general election, putting at least two Labour marginal seats in danger. This table has the figures. Stephen Bush at the New Statesman says Labour is gaining generally at the Lib Dems\u2019 expense. He says: After weeks of what looked like noise within the margin of error \u2013 thanks in part to the fact that very few pollsters are now doing polls more than once a week, which makes it difficult to draw out trends \u2013 we can now say with certainty that Labour are gaining ground in the polls. They are not doing so at the rate they did at the last election yet, and the Conservatives remain ahead in the polls, but there is a clear trend: of Labour gaining ground thanks to defections from the Liberal Democrats and Greens. As I\u2019ve written repeatedly, you should pay very little attention to the headline figures, because they might be wildly wrong in either direction. As it stands, we are a normal-sized polling error \u2013 that is to say, if either or both of the parties are being systematically under- or over-estimated by three percentage points \u2013 from either a Labour minority government or a Conservative landslide. Lord Ashcroft, the former Conservative deputy chairman who is now a polling specialist, says the latest polling he has commissioned shows Boris Johnson extending his lead over Jeremy Corbyn on the best PM measure. He says: Johnson\u2019s lead over Jeremy Corbyn on who would make the best prime minister has widened slightly to 17 points (44% to 27%) from 15 points last week. The proportion of Labour leavers naming Johnson is up slightly from last week at 40%, though still lower than when the campaign began. 84% of 2017 Conservatives name Johnson as the better of the two, while just 55% of 2017 Labour voters name Corbyn. The changes marked in the chart are from last week. From the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn Boris Johnson floated the idea of introducing charges for the NHS, including for ambulance visits, in a Spectator column in 1995, Business Insider\u2019s Adam Bienkov has revealed. In his story Bienkov reports: \u201cIf NHS services continue to be free in this way, they will continue to be abused, like any free service,\u201d [Johnson] wrote in the Spectator magazine in 1995. \u201cIf people have to pay for them, they will value them more.\u201d He added that those who say \u201cthe future NHS should be for those who are genuinely sick, and for the elderly,\u201d are \u201cbang on the nail.\u201d Writing about his own experience of calling for an ambulance for one of his children, who then turned out not to be seriously ill, he asked: \u201cWhy should I not be charged, say, \u00a350 for that inglorious episode, a fraction of its real cost?\u201d Johnson added that \u201cit seems reasonable that the middle classes should be required to stump up for non-essential services they can well afford.\u201d Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, has claimed that this proves Johnson has \u201cextremist views on the NHS\u201d and that he does not support the NHS being free at the point of use. At the time Johnson wrote the Spectator article he was not an MP. He has not expressed views like this recently, and the Conservative manifesto describes the NHS as representing \u201cthe best of this country\u201d, particularly because it is free at the point of use. Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, has said that she does not trust Donald Trump when he says that he does not want the NHS to be included in a UK-US trade deal. (See 10.15am.) Responding to what Trump said this morning, and referring to what the president said in a press conference in Britain in the summer, she said: [Trump] said something different earlier in the year when he said it would certainly be on the table. So, I think he is hardly somebody who is known for you being able to trust what they say. Swinson also suggested that Trump\u2019s comments this morning had been coordinated with No 10. Asked if she thought they had been agreed with Downing Street, she replied: We can just remember what it was like when Trump went on Nigel Farage\u2019s radio show and said that he wanted Farage and Johnson to do a deal, and a few days after that that\u2019s exactly what happened ... I\u2019m sure they have had conversations whether he will be helpful or not during the time that he is here. At a campaign event in Perth, where the SNP\u2019s Pete Wishart is hoping to increase his majority of 23 votes over the Tories, I witnessed a phenomenon that it\u2019s important to register is still ongoing: someone bursting into tears as they get a selfie with Nicola Sturgeon. \u201cHow can you not love her?\u201d asked a tearful June Abbott, 69, a long-time independence supporter after the first minister had apologised for making her cry. \u201cShe just feels like she\u2019s one of us.\u201d As cheering activists congregated around Wishart and Sturgeon at the city street stall, many reported what they believe is a change in mood towards their party since the last election campaign. The presence of a Brexit party candidate, who locals say has not been particularly visible, certainly helps in terms of hoovering up some former Tory voters, but Wishart himself was in buoyant mood, telling journalists that the two words doing best on the doorstep were \u201cBoris\u201d and \u201cJohnson\u201d in terms of winning SNP votes. Speaking to reporters during the visit, Sturgeon repeated concerns that Scotland\u2019s NHS was \u201con the line\u201d if a Tory-Trump post-Brexit trade deal were to take place. Asked about continuing concerns from the Scottish Jewish community about the SNP propping up a Corbyn minority administration, she said that she had yet to watch Corbyn\u2019s earlier remarks on antisemitism (see 11.32am), but added: My position is clear. We take action, as we did last week with a candidate [suspending Neale Hanvey, the SNP candidate for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath, after allegedly antisemitic social media posts came to light] where there is a need to do that. I am not responsible for Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s actions or lack of action, but my position on antisemitism is clear and I think for people who are worried about Corbyn on any issue, far better to have strong, progressive SNP influence on a Labour government, if there is to be a Labour government after this election, than not. Speaking at a rally in Bassetlaw earlier Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, claimed that his decision to stand down candidates in Tory-held constituencies might have cost up to 24 seats. He said: If we had stood against the Conservatives in those seats, I think you\u2019d have seen two dozen more Liberal Democrats led by Jo Swinson. Farage also claimed that he deserved the credit for Johnson becoming prime minister. He said: The only reason Boris is prime minister is because, earlier this year, I had had enough. After the launch of the Brexit party in Coventry in April ... we managed to get rid of the worst prime minister we have ever seen. Interesting, this analysis is one that Johnson shares himself. In their excellent new book about the Theresa May premiership, May at 10, Anthony Seldon and Raymond Newell quote what Johnson said to his supporter Conor Burns on the day of the final ballot of MPs in the summer leadership contest. Johnson said: There are two people I credit for my emergence as frontrunner: Theresa May for her failure to deliver, and Nigel Farage, who exploited the position left by her failure to deliver. If you can bear reliving the last three years, May at 10 is well worth reading. Some of the revelations are extraordinary. Faisal Islam, the BBC\u2019s economics editor, has posted a very good thread on Twitter explaining the extent to which drug prices would be an issue in a UK-US trade deal. It starts here. And here are his conclusions. From the Times\u2019 Steven Swinford Here are the main points from what Jeremy Corbyn said in his interview with Jeremy Vine on Radio 2 earlier about President Trump and the NHS. Corbyn said he hoped to be able to tell President Trump tonight that the NHS would not be for sale in UK-US trade talks. The two men are both attending a Buckingham Palace reception for the Nato summit. Corbyn said, if he got the chance, he would deliver a message to Trump. Asked what he would say, he replied: I will say: \u2018Welcome to this country. I hope you\u2019ll understand how precious our national health service is, and in any future trade relationship with the USA, none of our public services are on the table, none of our public services are for sale and investor state protection is not acceptable to our government when we\u2019ve won this election.\u2019 Corbyn also stressed that he would be polite. He was \u201calways polite\u201d, he said. Corbyn said he would ask Trump to change the guidelines issued to his trade negotiators to reflect the fact that the NHS was not on the table. Asked what he would say to Trump if Trump told him that he did not want access to the NHS, Corbyn replied: I will say: \u2018Thank you very much. I assume that will now be the basis of your administration\u2019s talks with our Department of [International] Trade.\u201d But Corbyn also expressed scepticism about the assurances that Trump has given on this subject today. Asked about Trump saying this morning that the US would not want access to the NHS, even if that were offered \u201con a silver platter\u201d (see 10.15am), Corbyn replied: I\u2019m pleased that he said that. But if that\u2019s the case, why have these talks gone on for two years. Why have they been kept secret? Why was, on a freedom of information request, the document only produced in redacted form? And eventually the full text has been released. And I think there [are] very, very legitimate grounds for very, very serious concerns. Corbyn was referring to the talks between UK and US officials described in detail in confidential government papers that were leaked and released by Labour last week. When it was put to him that those papers did not contain evidence of British officials agreeing that the US would get access to the NHS in a trade deal, Corbyn replied: Clearly [the officials] were working under authority. And clearly there was a serious discussion about the relationship with access to public services and investor state protection, which is a very bad thing, in my view, because it gives multinational companies the power to sue national governments in an international legal process. That\u2019s already happened with Philip Morris tobacco and various governments around the world. I don\u2019t think we want any of that written into any trade agreement we have with another country. Corbyn dismissed the significance of the claim in the Conservative election manifesto that \u201cwhen we are negotiating trade deals, the NHS will not be on the table.\u201d Asked about this assurance, Corbyn replied: Well, it absolutely is on the table because they\u2019ve discussed patent extensions. And patents are the things that give us the very high prices for specialist medicines. And if we reduce the length of patents or, if there has been a public investment in those patent researches, we buy that patent, then we get cheaper medicines. This is what the Tory manifesto says in full on this point: When we are negotiating trade deals, the NHS will not be on the table. The price the NHS pays for drugs will not be on the table. The services the NHS provides will not be on the table. Corbyn said, if he became prime minister, he would be respectful towards Trump in their dealings. Asked how he would treat the US president, he replied: I will treat him with respect, as I would everybody else. And also make very clear that any trade relationship with the USA will not involve investor protection for US companies and will absolutely not involve access to our public services, and crucially, of course, our national health service. And this is from my colleague Rowena Mason, who was with Boris Johnson in Salisbury this morning. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale From BuzzFeed\u2019s Mark Di Stefano Q: You have the lowest popularity ratings for a leader since records began. Does that worry you? Corbyn says he does not comment on polls. He will not start now. This is not just about him, he says. He says he has a lot of highly motivated candidates who want to win the election. The interview is over. Vine says they asked if there was a record Corbyn wanted to play. He says he was told Get Ready, by the Temptations. Corbyn says he would be an \u201chonest broker\u201d in a second referendum campaign. Q: What happens if your team negotiates a fantastic Brexit deal, and you can hardly contain your excitement? Corbyn says he can contain his excitement in all circumstances. Q: But what happens if it is so good that you should campaign for it? Corbyn says he wants the public to take the decision. Q: In your heart of hearts you are a Brexiter, aren\u2019t you? Corbyn says he has been accused of many things. He wants a prosperous economy, and for the people to make the final decision. Q: You are promising lots of free stuff. Can you afford this? Referring to broadband, Corbyn says this is an essential service. Q: The IFS says it is unlikely Labour will be able to raise the sums it needs for its plans. Corbyn says that is what the IFS says. He says Labour thinks it can raise the money. There is a debate to be had about this, he says. He says the Labour party has spoken to the IFS about this. Q: And, after the manifesto came out, you announced plans to spend \u00a358bn compensating the Waspi women. Where does that money come from? Corbyn says Labour would use the \u201cheadroom\u201d available. Is it right to break a contract with these women, he asks. He says these women paid into the system expecting a pension. Q: Shouldn\u2019t Labour have pointed out in the 1990s what the government was doing on this? Corbyn says Labour has said it will address this, and it will. And here are some lines from earlier in the interview. Jeremy Corbyn is being interviewed by Jeremy Vine on Radio 2 now. Q: Dave Merritt, whose father Jack was killed in the London Bridge attack, said he did not want politicians to exploit his son\u2019s death. But hasn\u2019t Labour done some of this as well as the Conservatives, by talking about spending cuts? Corbyn says he met Dave Merritt at the vigil yesterday. He says resources for prisons and the Probation Service are an issue. Q: But won\u2019t lots of people support the Tory \u2018lock them up and throw away the key\u2019 approach? Corbyn says this would require many more prison places. And eventually prisoners come out. Q: Doesn\u2019t this case suggest deradicalisation does not work? Corbyn says the government should not allow prisons to become a breeding ground for extremism. Here is more from what President Trump said in his press briefing earlier. Asked if he could work with a possible Prime Minister [Jeremy] Corbyn, Trump replied: I can work with anybody. I\u2019m a very easy person to work with. You wouldn\u2019t believe it. Trump also seemed to acknowledge that he might not be popular in the UK. This sounded new; on previous visits, he has been keen to boast about how popular he is in the UK. (He isn\u2019t.) In response to a question about the UK election, Trump said in the US, when he endorsed candidates, he helped them win elections. But Britain was different, he said. I\u2019ve won virtually every race that I\u2019ve participated in [in the US, where he has endorsed candidates.]. But this is a different country. I say often, in Germany they like Obama. The reason they like Obama is because Obama gave the ship away. He allowed them to take everything. He gave them things that I wouldn\u2019t do. I love Germany, I love this country, I love other countries. But I\u2019m representing the US. So they may not like me because I\u2019m representing us, and I represent us strong. President Obama did not represent us [strongly]; he gave everything away, and he shouldn\u2019t have done that. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re still paying a price for what he did. So, I\u2019ll stay out of the election. Channel 4 has been cleared over its use of an ice sculpture to stand in for Boris Johnson during a debate on climate change, Ofcom has said. As PA Media reports, Ofcom said the prop \u201cwas not a representation of the prime minister personally\u201d, and that \u201clittle editorial focus was given to it, either visually or in references made by the presenter or debate participants\u201d. The Conservatives complained that the broadcaster failed to allow the former environment secretary Michael Gove to be its representative for the debate, during which party leaders faced questions over how they would tackle climate change. Rejecting the complaint, Ofcom said: Broadcasters have editorial freedom in determining the format of any election debate. Depending on the circumstances, they may choose to proceed without having agreed the participation of a particular political party or politician, providing they take steps to ensure the programme complies with our due impartiality and elections rules. In this case, the election committee concluded that, across the one-hour debate and a subsequent news programme, Channel 4\u2019s use of editorial techniques ensured that the Conservative\u2019s viewpoint on climate and environmental issues was adequately reflected and given due weight. The committee also took into account that the globe ice sculpture was not a representation of the prime minister personally, and little editorial focus was given to it, either visually or in references made by the presenter or debate participants. The committee therefore considered that this programme, including the use of the ice sculpture, did not raise issues warranting further investigation under our due impartiality and elections rules. Boris Johnson said he could \u201ccategorically rule out\u201d that \u201cany part of the NHS will be on the table in any trade negotiations\u201d, including pharmaceuticals, when he spoke to reporters during a campaign visit to Salisbury this morning. He described Labour claims that the NHS was under threat (see 9.19am) as \u201cpure Loch Ness Monster, Bermuda Triangle stuff\u201d. Asked if Donald Trump\u2019s support was an embarrassment to him, Johnson said: On the contrary and I have good relations with Washington, the president, with President Macron, Chancellor Merkel and that\u2019s vital for the UK and we\u2019ll be having a series of meetings \u2013 bilateral, trilateral of all kinds \u2013 in the course of the next couple of days. Any readers requiring an explanation of the \u201cBermuda Triangle\u201d jibe will find one on Wikipedia here. Like many of Johnson\u2019s cultural references, this one relates to something prominent in the media in the 1970s. Almost a third of voters now say they will vote tactically in the election, according to polling carried out for the Electoral Reform Society (ERS), with the proportion rising rapidly. The polling by BMG found 30% of people said they would be \u201cvoting for the best-positioned party/candidate to keep out another party/candidate that I dislike\u201d on 12 December. This is up from 22% saying this at the start of the election campaign, and 24% in a parallel poll last week. Only 51% of people said they would pick \u201cthe candidate/party I most prefer, regardless of how likely they are to win\u201d. The ERS, which has long campaigned for a move from the first-past-the-post electoral system to a proportional method, said the polling \u201cshould sound alarm bells for our democracy\u201d, adding that given the sometimes contradictory advice on who to vote for tactically in different seats, the election could become \u201ca lottery\u201d. In his ITV This Morning interview Jeremy Corbyn also said that he was \u201cvery sorry\u201d for \u201ceverything that has happened\u201d in his party regarding antisemitism. This came when he came under repeated pressure to say sorry from the presenter, Phillip Schofield. (See 10.56am.) Corbyn said: Our party and me do not accept antisemitism in any form ... Obviously I\u2019m very sorry for everything that has happened. But I want to make this very clear: I am dealing with it, I have dealt with it, other parties are also affected by antisemitism. Candidates have been withdrawn by the Liberal Democrats, and the Conservatives and by us because of it. We just do not accept it in any form whatsoever. Corbyn has apologised to the Jewish community several times in the past for his party\u2019s handling of antisemitism, but he caused controversy when he refused to apologise last week when challenged to do so in his interview with the BBC\u2019s Andrew Neil. That interview was mostly rather bland, but at the end Jeremy Corbyn said something that at face value sounded very interesting. Phillip Schofield asked: Would you still be Labour leader at the end of, if you were prime minister, or whatever happens on 12 [December], would you still be Labour leader at the end of the next term? Corbyn replied: I hope so, yes, because I feel I\u2019m fit, I feel I\u2019m quite young enough to do the job ... and I\u2019m very determined to carry out what we\u2019ve got there, because we\u2019ve got [to] change our country, we\u2019ve got to change our society, we cannot go on with this massive division between the richest and the poorest, and call ourselves a decent, civilised country. So, I want to help people all across the country. And that\u2019s what I want our government to do. And, do you know what? I\u2019m absolutely looking forward to doing it, starting in Christmas week. Taken literally, Corbyn seems to be saying he intends to stay on as Labour leader for a full parliamentary term regardless of whether or not he wins the election. But, taking into account the context (ie, the reference to carrying out the Labour manifesto, and being in government) it seems much more likely that Corbyn was addressing the point about whether he intended to serve a full term as prime minister if he wins the election. (He does - or at least, he always says he does when asked this question.) There are very few people at the top of the Labour party who would expect him to stay on for another five years as leader if the party loses, and that does not seem to be what he meant to say. But I will ask the party for clarification. UPDATE: I have amended the paragraph above to say there are very few people at the top of the Labour party who think Jeremy Corbyn could stay on for five years if he loses. The original sentence said that was the view in the party as a whole. It might be, but we don\u2019t know that the membership as a whole thinks on this point, and some members would want Corbyn to stay on for as long as he wanted. Q: Aren\u2019t you exhausted by the campaigning? No, says Corbyn. He says he believes in public service. He believes in representing people. And he wants to have a society where we don\u2019t have food banks, or child poverty. He says he is inspired by the wisdom he encounters. He says he goes around with a note book. He writes notes everywhere he goes. He says everyone you meet knows something you don\u2019t. Q: What happens if you don\u2019t win? Corbyn says he intends to win. Q: But if you don\u2019t? Corbyn says his principles and life will be the same. Corbyn says, when he became Labour leader, there were no processes for dealing with antisemitism. He introduced those, plus a fast-track disciplinary system. And a system of education. He says a rabbi was attacked in north London this week. That was disgusting. He has discussed this with other rabbis, he says. Q: Will you apologise to the Jewish community for any antisemitism committed by Labour members? Corbyn starts an explanation. Schofield intervenes: \u201cJust say sorry.\u201d Corbyn says he is sorry for what has happened. He says antisemitism is a poison. You know what happens, from 20th century history, if it is allowed to continue. Q: Many people will fear that, if you tax big business more, prices will go up for everyone. Corbyn says people need higher wages. And we need to so something about child poverty. Raising wages is good, he says. He says he wants to invest in infrastructure and training. Q: President Trump said today he wants nothing to do with the NHS. And it has been claimed that you obtained a dossier about UK-US trade talks that the Russians might have helped to publicise. Corbyn says no one has suggested that that dossier was not accurate. Trump himself has said in the past that everything would be on the table in trade talks. Q: Diane Abbott has called for the abolition of groups like MI5. And you have called for similar things? Corbyn says he is not calling for the abolition of MI5. But he wants these organisations to be accountable. UPDATE: This question relates to an early day motion that Abbott signed in 1989. Abbott does not back the abolition of MI5 now. Jeremy Corbyn is being interview now by Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield. Q: Boris Johnson says in the Sun today that the country would not be safe with you as PM. Is that true? Corbyn says his first job as PM would be to keep people safe. That requires more spending on the police. And, internationally, we should not allow there to be vast areas of ungoverned space. Q: Should terrorists serve life sentences? Corbyn says it depends what they did. Sentences should be decided by courts. But the Prison Service is woefully underfunded, he says. He says the lesson from the London Bridge attack is that we need to improve this. Jeremy Corbyn is about to give an interview to ITV\u2019s This Morning. At his press briefing President Trump was asked about Prince Andrew. Trump claimed he did not know him. As BuzzFeed\u2019s Mark Di Stafano points out, the picture archive suggests otherwise. At his press briefing President Trump was most critical of his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, who recently said that Nato was suffering \u201cbrain death\u201d. Trump said Macron\u2019s comments were \u201cvery insulting\u201d. He also said has \u201cvery surprised\u201d at Macron\u2019s analysis. He said: Turkey responded by saying that he was brain dead which was interesting ... I heard that President Macron said that Nato was brain dead. I think that is very insulting to a lot of different forces. It has a great purpose. Trump said Macron was being \u201cvery disrespectful\u201d to other members of the Nato alliance members, and he attacked Macron\u2019s own domestic record. It is a very, very nasty statement. I think they have a very high unemployment rate in France. France is not doing well economically at all. It is a very tough statement to make when you have such difficulty in France when you look at what is going on with the yellow vests. They have had a very rough year. You just can\u2019t go around making statements like that about Nato. It is very disrespectful. Trump is not necessarily the best person to complain about people being rude about Nato. Before he became president, he called the alliance \u201cobsolete\u201d in an interview in 2016. Only this week he also called some of its members \u201cdelinquent\u201d. The Trump press briefing is over. According to Sky, he was only expected to say a few words at what had been billed as essentially a photo opportunity. Instead he took questions for around 50 minutes. I will be post more from what he said shortly. This is what President Trump said when he was asked if he thought the NHS should be on the table in trade deals. He replied: No, not at all, I have nothing to do with it. Never even thought about it, honestly ... I don\u2019t even know where that rumour started. We have absolutely nothing to do with it and we wouldn\u2019t want to if you handed it to us on a silver platter, we want nothing to do with it. Trump has just been asked if he thinks Jeremy Corbyn needs to do more to tackle the problem of antisemitism in his party. He says he does not know anything about this issue. This is what President Trump said about the UK election. I have no thoughts on it. It\u2019s going to be a very important election for this great country, but I have no thoughts on it. But Trump also said he would be meeting Boris Johnson while he is in the UK for the Nato meeting. Asked if there would be a meeting, he said: I will be meeting with him, yes ... I have many meetings. I have meetings set up with lots of different countries. Asked why he was staying out of the election, Trump said: Because I don\u2019t want to complicate it. I\u2019ll stay out of the election. You know that I was a fan of Brexit. I called it the day before. I think Boris is very capable and I think he\u2019ll do a good job. Trump has repeatedly claimed that he predicted the result of the Brexit referendum in advance, when he was visiting his golf course in Scotland. As explained here, this is not true. Trump defends his policy towards North Korea. He has a good relationship with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean dictator, he says. He says if President Obama were still in the White House, the two countries would be at war. Trump claims he has become \u201ca bigger fan\u201d of Nato because Nato members have been flexible. He also says Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary general, is doing a great job. Stoltenberg is with him at this press briefing at Winfield House, the US ambassador\u2019s residence in London, but Stoltenberg is not getting the chance to say very much because Trump is rambling on at length. Here is the NHS quote. Here are more lines from the Trump press briefing. Donald Trump is speaking to reporters at Winfield House, the US ambassador\u2019s residence, now. He has also claimed he could work with Jeremy Corbyn. He could work with anyone, he said. This is from CNN\u2019s White House correspondent, Kaitlan Collins. As Rowena Mason and Heather Stewart report in their overnight story, No 10 has been very anxious for Trump to avoid doing or saying anything that would be seen as an endorsement of Boris Johnson because, given Trump\u2019s unpopularity in the UK, that would not be helpful. Trump seems to have got the message (although whether he can maintain his self-restraint for two days remains to be seen). Obviously, the claim that Trump has \u201cno thoughts\u201d on the election is not true. He told LBC in an interview last month that Jeremy Corbyn would be \u201cbad\u201d for the country and that Johnson was a \u201cfantastic man\u201d. These are from my colleague Kate Proctor, who has been covering a Jeremy Corbyn event in London this morning. Last night Jeremy Corbyn released the text of an open letter he has written to Donald Trump asking for assurances that the NHS, and drug prices in particular, will not be included in the proposed UK-US trade deal. It is one of those letters from politicians clearly not drafted in the expectation that it might receive a reply, but it is interesting nonetheless, particularly for the amount of detail it contains about the eight changes Corbyn wants to the American negotiating objectives for a UK-US trade deal. Here is the key extract. To assure the British public that the NHS and other UK public services will not be opened up to \u201ctotal market access\u201d and irreversible privatisation, and that all aspects of NHS pharmaceuticals procurement will truly be taken off the table in a US-UK trade agreement, I am writing to you today to ask you to request US negotiating objectives are revised as a matter of urgency so that they: Exclude any reference to pharmaceuticals. Accept the role of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence to set the threshold for the cost-effectiveness of drugs for the NHS. Drop the demand for \u201ctotal market access\u201d to UK public services. Explicitly rule out any investor-state dispute settlement mechanism by which the UK government could be sued for protecting public services. Exclude any provision on regulatory exclusivities such as data exclusivity, marketing exclusivity, therapeutic exclusivity and other non-patent monopolies. Exclude any provision that could remove caps on the amount the NHS spends on branded medicines each year, including anything that might enable the US to take legal action against the UK\u2019s voluntary price access scheme. Ensure NHS patient data are fully exempted from digital trade and data sharing provisions in the agreement. Exclude any provision that would prevent the NHS from negotiating deals for the health service as a whole. A revision of the US negotiating objectives along these lines would go a long way to reassuring the British public that the US government will not be seeking total market access to the UK public services; that the NHS will not be on the table in US-UK trade negotiations; that a US-UK trade deal will not open up NHS services to irreversible privatisation; and that the US government accepts that our NHS is not for sale in any form. Corbyn also released this video making the same point. This video features a quote from Trump at a press conference with Theresa May in June saying the NHS would be included in trade talks. But when Trump was asked specifically about the NHS, he did not seem to know what the acronym referred to and later, after his comment provoked a major row, he gave an interview saying he did not want the NHS to be included in trade talks. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Simon Murphy. As reported earlier, in his Today interview Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, was asked by the presenter Nick Robinson about his involvement in a book that advocated privatisation of health services. (See 8.21am) Raab said he has never personally advocated NHS privatisation. Robinson was referring to After the Coalition, a book published in 2011 and written jointly by Kwasi Kwarteng, Priti Patel, Chris Skidmore, Liz Truss and Raab. At the time they were all Conservative backbenchers. Now three of them are cabinet ministers (Raab, Patel and Truss), Kwarteng attends cabinet as a minister of state and Skidmore is also a minister of state. The Mirror\u2019s Dan Bloom has posted an extract from the book on Twitter. Some would argue that allowing private providers to supply NHS services (which happens quite extensively at the moment) does amount to \u201cprivatisation of the NHS\u201d, which is what Raab said this morning that he opposed. But others would argue that phrase implies the wholesale sell-off of the NHS, which is something quite different. More from Dominic Raab\u2019s interview earlier on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme as the foreign secretary also claimed the Conservatives have no plans to privatise the NHS. It comes after Jeremy Corbyn last week produced leaked papers detailed US trade talks which he claimed proved the NHS was \u201cup for sale\u201d \u2013 an allegation denied by the Tories. \u201c[We\u2019re] absolutely clear there\u2019s going to be no privatisation of the NHS under the Conservatives\u2019 watch or this prime minister\u2019s watch,\u201d Raab said. In relation to drugs, there\u2019s going to be no dilution of our protection of consumers in this country. Obviously we want the cheapest and highest quality medicines coming into the NHS, there\u2019s going to be no dilution of our position on that whatsoever. Asked about his involvement in writing a paper advocating privatisation, he said: You\u2019ve picked probably a snippet from a pamphlet written a long time ago, but I can tell you categorically I\u2019ve never advocated privatisation of the NHS. The Labour shadow minister Laura Piddock has dodged questions on reports suggesting Russia had a role planting a leaked NHS document that Jeremy Corbyn presented last week as proof the country\u2019s health service was on the table in US trade talks. Reuters reported last night that experts at Oxford and Cardiff universities, as well as the Atlantic Council thinktank, said the document\u2019s release on Reddit before it was seized on by Labour \u201cresembles a disinformation campaign uncovered this year that originated in Russia\u201d. \u201cWhoever did this \u2026 was absolutely trying to keep it a secret,\u201d Graham Brookie, the director of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Digital Forensic Research Lab, told Reuters. \u201cIt carries the spectre of foreign influence.\u201d The story, which the Daily Telegraph splashed on today, led to questioning of Piddock by Sky\u2019s Kay Burley this morning but she dismissed it as a \u201cmassive distraction\u201d. Footage has emerged of Donald Trump\u2019s motorcade apparently arriving in north London to shouts of abuse last night after he touched down on UK soil in Air Force One. The US president\u2019s motorcade was given a frosty welcome as it passed through Camden, with yells of \u201cget out of here\u201d \u2013 and some ruder cries \u2013 from passersby caught on camera. The foreign secretary also said he sympathised with the father of Jack Merritt, whose son was murdered during the London Bridge terror attack on Friday, after he said the tragedy had been used to \u201cfurther an agenda of hate\u201d. Dave Merritt wrote an impassioned piece in the Guardian saying that his son would have been seething at how his death was being used. \u201cWhat Jack would want from this is for all of us to walk through the door he has booted down, in his black Doc Martens,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThat door opens up a world where we do not lock up and throw away the key. Where we do not give indeterminate sentences, or convict people on joint enterprise. Where we do not slash prison budgets, and where we focus on rehabilitation not revenge.\u201d Dominic Raab refused to accept that he had a fundamentally different worldview to that of Jack Merritt. \u201cI sympathise with the anguish of the family and can\u2019t imagine what they must be going through. The first duty that we\u2019ve got as a government is to take every measure we can to make sure that we don\u2019t see further families going through that same suffering and anguish,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. Our duty is to protect the public and that\u2019s why, and you mentioned prison places, our manifesto is clear, we don\u2019t want to cut those, we want to increase them by 10,000. Of course, we want to reform and rehabilitate criminal offenders where that\u2019s possible but I think, in this case and in the level of very serious dangerous, criminal offenders, it\u2019s clear that some of those we will struggle to be sure that we can reform, that they will rehabilitate. We are absolutely clear, we will not allow the release of people onto the streets who present a danger. He added: \u201cAnd that separates us from Jeremy Corbyn, who has made clear he would be willing to see those sorts of dangerous offenders released.\u201d The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, claims he does not know whether Boris Johnson will be meeting the US president, Donald Trump, for one-on-one talks during his visit to the UK for the Nato summit. Amid claims that the prime minister is dodging bilateral talks with Trump, fearing it would hamper his campaigning efforts in the general election, Raab was evasive on the issue. \u201cI don\u2019t know the full range of bilaterals, those things are always very fluid,\u201d Raab told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. Actually, the role of this leaders\u2019 summit, and we are hosting it, is for the prime minister to bring all of our north American and European partners together and show that through Nato we can be bigger than the sum of our parts. Asked to clarify again whether he does not know whether the two leaders will be meeting, Raab said: I said that the arrangements for bilaterals are always quite fluid because they\u2019re done on the margins. This is a meeting for Nato as a whole and the prime minister\u2019s job \u2026 is to bring all of our allies together in the same room, not syphoned off in bilaterals because we\u2019ve got this unity of purpose we need to forge to strengthen Nato and that\u2019s the leadership role that the prime minister is taking. Good morning folks, Simon Murphy here to take you through the morning\u2019s politics news as Donald Trump visits the UK for the Nato summit. Looks like the US president still had his attention on affairs back at home when he touched down on UK soil last night: From Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary Labour has promised to end what it calls the \u201chostile environment\u201d for disabled people in the social security system as part of a raft of plans to tackle discrimination. The party\u2019s disability manifesto, published on Tuesday morning, proposes a range of measures across welfare, public services, transport, housing and jobs to enable disabled people to live independently, be treated with dignity and respect, and participate fully in society. The manifesto promises to sweep away a hostile environment of prejudice against disabled people it says was promoted by government to justify nine years of austerity cuts, and replace it with system that ends poverty and offers people security and dignity. \u201cWhat British democracy needs right now is the advice of a cartoonist who doesn\u2019t even live in your wretched country,\u201d writes Guardian Australia\u2019s cartoonist First Dog on the Moon. The day ahead \u2022 Boris Johnson is expected to be campaigning in south-west England. \u2022 Jeremy Corbyn is due to give a speech in London on workers\u2019 rights. \u2022 Jo Swinson is expected to visit a farm in the east of England. \u2022 Nato leaders are gathering for the alliance summit over Tuesday and Wednesday. The main talks will take place on Wednesday near Watford and Johnson will break off from election campaigning to play host. Good morning and welcome to another day in politics. Today, Donald Trump is in town and his presence in London today for Nato meetings is causing jitters in the Conservative camp, as the Tories worry about the US president\u2019s unpredictability and tendency to say things without necessarily thinking through the consequences. Trump is being seen as a potential liability for Boris Johnson in the campaign, amid Labour\u2019s accusations that a US-UK trade deal will lead to an NHS sell-off and higher drug prices for Britons, with the Guardian\u2019s Rowena Mason writing that Johnson will seek to downplay his relationship with the president in light of the NHS accusations. Johnson has made clear that he would not welcome any input from Trump at such a sensitive time in the campaign, after the US president offered his endorsement over the summer. But Trump has a full two days in the UK and is expected to give a press conference on Wednesday. The Tories will be hopeful he says little or nothing to inflame voter fears. Trump will be among world leaders attending a banquet with the Queen tonight at Buckingham Palace. NHS nurses and doctors will lead a \u201cHands off our NHS\u201d protest starting at Trafalgar Square then heading down the Mall to arrive at Canada Gate, opposite the palace. Also protesting outside Buckingham Palace will be the family of Harry Dunn, the 19-year-old who was killed in a motorbike crash in Northamptonshire in August. Anne Sacoolas, the 42-year-old motorist allegedly responsible, claimed diplomatic immunity and was allowed to return to the US. We\u2019ll have all the politics news for, so stay with us.

The region \u2013 often dubbed the \u201cTexas of Canada\u201d \u2013 has some of the world\u2019s largest oil reserves, but a lack of pipelines has made it exceedingly difficult to move the oil to market.

Economic conditions are bad, but at that very point you have governments layering on policies which make the situation worse. That\u2019s why people are directing their anger toward the federal government,\u201d said Amber Ruddy, a political strategist at the conservative lobby group Counsel. In the face of a looming crisis of national unity, Trudeau last week appointed a new western adviser and moved one of his most senior allies \u2013 former foreign minister Chrystia Freeland \u2013 to a new position where she will be in charge of negotiations with provincial governments. But that may not be enough to change opinions in Alberta, where a perception that the federal government is indifferent to the region\u2019s economic pain has given fringe groups a populist rallying cry. Independence remains a minority cause, but there are signs it is gaining momentum. At a recent rally with more than 700 attendees in the city of Edmonton, the leader of the newly formed Wexit party told the crowd he intended to submit 543 signatures to Elections Canada for his movement to be designated a federal party. \u201cThere\u2019s this eastern Canadian mentality \u2013 a willingness to throw the chains on us,\u201d said party leader Peter Downing, a retired police officer. \u201cIn reality, it\u2019s a colonialist mindset and we\u2019ve simply had enough.

But there is plentiful evidence of members using racial epithets towards immigrants and Indigenous peoples. And while Downing and others have framed the frustration sweeping the region as a reaction to recent policies, the grievances of the west have deep roots in the region\u2019s past relationship with the rest of Canada. In the early 1980s, the prairie provinces rebelled against Justin Trudeau\u2019s father, prime minister Pierre Trudeau, after he proposed exerting greater federal control over the country\u2019s oilfields as a way of hedging against the influence of Opec \u2013 at the expense of Alberta\u2019s provincial revenues. The policy, known as the National Energy Program, was deeply controversial and eroded any Liberal support in the region. But even further back, westerners saw themselves as bootstrapping settlers whose hard work was frittered away for the benefit of eastern Canada. A notorious 1915 cartoon called the \u201cMilch Cow\u201d depicted farmers in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba working hard to feed a cow, while top-hatted bankers directed her milk into buckets labelled \u201cOttawa\u201d, \u201cToronto\u201d and \u201cMontreal\u201d. \u201cPeople need a myth.

Many Albertans, believe that the policy is unfair; Downing characterizes the relationship as one of \u201cexpropriation\u201d. But the popular understanding of equalization in the province \u2013 that it is dragging down Alberta\u2019s economy \u2013 is plain wrong, said Trevor Tombe, an economist at the University of Calgary.

The look was such a hit that the bradigan (and an excellent late-summer suntan) <a href=\"https://www.vogue.co.uk/news/article/katie-holmes-style\">rebooted the Katie Holmes brand</a> almost as effectively as, say, landing a whopping contract with Marvel, or having a secret love affair with Justin Trudeau*.

Rihanna wore this ankle-grazing cardie to Chanel\u2019s autumn/winter haute couture show in 2013, where what she lacked in underwear she made up for in pearls. The cardigan dress is a look the singer has returned to on numerous occasions \u2013 including earlier this year when she wore <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7469945/Rihanna-shows-stunning-legs-camo-cardigan-Louis-Vuitton-purse.html\">an oversized camo cardigan by Miu Miu</a> following her first Savage x Fenty lingerie show in New York.

John Travolta\u2019s slicked back hair and black jeans remain; rarely has a cardigan signified such a stark personality shift. Of course, this is not any old cardie: it\u2019s sporty, it\u2019s preppy, it belongs, really, in the wardrobe of annoyingly clean-cut love-rival Tom Chisum. And it is only worn for a little over a minute \u2013 being quickly shrugged off after Sandy rocks up with a perm and a cigarette \u2013 but it is a look that has been emulated \u2013 albeit, often with a sense of irony \u2013 ever since.

Post-slacker and Kevin Smith and pre-Judd Apatow stoner (hi, Seth Rogan, Jonah Hill), The Dude became the ultimate cinematic antihero. And this cardigan, a bulky, Cowichan knit was his superhero outfit. On another body, this is less of a cardigan and more of a bro-digan \u2013 the sort of thing worn by a character in a 50s musical who is about to chop down some trees and quickly build a cabin in the woods. But in the Dude\u2019s hands it signalled a life lived off the beaten track, off the clock and following the beat of your own drum. To paraphrase the great man, that cardigan really ties the room together. <em>Priya Elan</em></p> <h2>6.

It might not be Cher\u2019s \u201cmost capable looking outfit\u201d, but she certainly deserves snaps for her \u201ccourageous fashion efforts\u201d. <em>LH</em></p> <h2>5.

So it\u2019s surprising that Kate, Duchess of Cambridge was so on point with this sartorial choice for Prince George: a (yes) <a href=\"https://ca.hellomagazine.com/fashion/02015050515902/prince-george-s-blue-cardigan-sold-out-just-hours-after-he-met-sister-charlotte\">royal blue knit with five pearl-coloured buttons</a> that gave George the look of a mischievous cartoon elf about to create havoc in a magical kingdom. It\u2019s so good that we, as fully grown, non-infant humans, might consider replicating the look IRL. <em>PE</em></p> <h2>4.

Instead of playing as the opener of Nirvana\u2019s third act, the Unplugged show now played like a funeral waltz; a chilling premonitory evocation of what was to happen. In the accompanying video, the closeups of Kurt\u2019s face were haunting: framed by his dirty, wheat-coloured hair and piercing blue eyes, frame after frame now suggested a broken man who had ascended to the position of sad angel. Central to this aesthetic was Kurt\u2019s cardigan. Made of smooth, dreamy mohair, his unwashed, cigarette-burned, olive-green cardie became the Turin shroud of indie rock, as he ascended to the patron saint of musical sorrow. <em>PE</em></p> <h2>3.

She also designed her own tweed cardigan jackets using light boucle wools in pastel colours which \u2013 in an early blurring of the line between men\u2019s and women\u2019s fashions \u2013 gave the garment greater appeal with women. Chanel\u2019s cardigans were also predominantly designed to be worn indoors \u2013 revolutionary! <em>LH</em></p> <h2>2. <a href=\"https://images.app.goo.gl/6EmxJHy3K7gLQEbi6\">Marilyn Monroe on Santa Monica beach</a> (1962)</h2> <p>I think we can agree that Marilyn Monroe knew how to do sexy. And long before Succession\u2019s Logan Roy made the shawl-collar cardigan a thing, Monroe showed the world a chunky, cosy knit could pack a punch. George Barris\u2019s photographs of her in a chunky graphic cardigan belted with a silk-robe looseness, platinum hair sideswept in the sea breeze, are a bluechip style reference. The cardigan fetched $167,500 when <a href=\"http://themarilynmonroecollection.com/the-personal-property-of-marilyn-monroe-a-hand-knitted-cardigan/\">it was sold by Monroe\u2019s estate at auction</a>.

No clear winner. Biden suffered another train wreck of a night, says Nathan Robinson, but the Guardian\u2019s panel could not identify a clear winner in Atlanta. Sondland blows Trump\u2019s impeachment defence wide open The US ambassador to the EU dismantled the White House\u2019s core impeachment defence on Wednesday, telling Congress there was indeed a quid pro quo, with Trump offering the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, an Oval Office meeting on one condition: that he announce an investigation into the Bidens. Gordon Sondland not only implicated the president, but also threw several other senior administration officials under the bus \u2013 not to mention Trump\u2019s personal lawyer and Ukraine policy proxy, Rudy Giuliani. But Republicans seized on the fact he acknowledged he never heard directly from Trump that the security assistance hinged on an announcement of investigations. Stalled aid. The Pentagon official Laura Cooper knocked down another White House claim, telling the inquiry Ukraine raised concerns about the suspension of nearly $400m in military aid on the same day as Trump\u2019s infamous phone call with Zelenskiy. Fiona Hill. The White House\u2019s top Russia expert, Fiona Hill, is to testify on Thursday, when she is expected to outline her concerns about the \u201cshadow\u201d foreign policy being run in the region by Giuliani, Sondland and others. Interim rightwing government blamed for Bolivia \u2018massacre\u2019 At least eight Bolivians were killed on Tuesday when supporters of the country\u2019s exiled former president, Evo Morales, confronted troops after blockading a fuel storage depot in the city of El Alto. Morales described the events as a \u201cmassacre\u201d, blaming the rightwing interim government that took power after he was ousted this month. But the defence minister, Fernando L\u00f3pez, said \u201cnot a single bullet\u201d had been fired by the security forces. Political unrest. At least 31 people have been killed during the political unrest in Bolivia, triggered by a dispute over the result of the presidential election on 20 October, in which Morales claimed victory only to resign under pressure from the military. Epstein victims\u2019 lawyers hint at subpoena for Prince Andrew Prince Andrew\u2019s public disgrace has intensified after the Duke of York announced on Wednesday that his mother, the Queen, had \u201cgiven her permission\u201d for him to step back from royal duties for the foreseeable future as he attempts to weather the storm over his relationship with the late financier and convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Lisa Bloom, a lawyer representing five of Epstein\u2019s victims, suggested she was prepared to subpoena the prince to ensure he cooperated with her investigations. PR disaster. The BBC interview about the prince\u2019s involvement with Epstein was intended to halt speculation but instead has increased it. Kevin Rawlinson explains how the royal\u2019s questionable PR strategy unraveled. Cheat sheet Google has announced it will no longer allow political advertisers to target its users based on their political affiliation, heaping fresh pressure on its rival Facebook to alter its own controversial policy on political ads. More than 80 members of Congress, 55 civil rights groups and three Democratic presidential candidates have joined calls for the White House adviser Stephen Miller to resign after leaked emails revealed his promotion of a white nationalist agenda. Apple has abruptly canceled the premiere of its first big film release, The Banker, amid what it called \u201cconcerns surrounding the film\u201d, which stars Samuel L Jackson and Anthony Mackie in the true story of two black entrepreneurs in the civil rights era. Half of the world\u2019s donkey population could be wiped out in the next five years to feed China\u2019s appetite for ejiao, a traditional medicine extracted from the animals\u2019 hides. Help the Guardian to cover another momentous year In 2019, reader contributions helped the Guardian to produce high-impact reports on politics, the climate crisis and other key issues. If you are enjoying this newsletter, we hope you will consider a year-end gift to help us do the same in 2020. Must-reads Why 2019 is the year of the whistleblower on film From documentaries to political and corporate dramas set on both sides of the Atlantic, 2019 has seen multiple on-screen portrayals of real-life heroes who called out corruption. The whistleblower who dares to challenge the system has become a pop cultural myth, says Charles Bramesco. A shocking murder in the north Pacific in 2015, the lawyer Rachelle Bergeron moved from the US to Yap, a sleepy Pacific island community where gun violence was rare. Yet this October, while working to prosecute a human trafficking ring, she was gunned down outside her home, as Bernadette Carreon and Lauren Aratani report. Can Louisville re-green itself out of a heat emergency? The biggest city in Kentucky is also one of the US\u2019s fastest-warming \u201curban heat islands\u201d, with city temperatures averaging almost 5F hotter than the surrounding countryside. Josh Wood asks whether a plan to replant tens of thousands of lost trees could help Louisville keep its cool. Trudeau puts his trust in new deputy prime minister Canada\u2019s Justin Trudeau has appointed a deputy prime minister for the first time since 2006. While Chrystia Freeland\u2019s new role is traditionally ceremonial, Trudeau has given her the added responsibility of managing his government\u2019s fractious relationship with the provinces, as Leyland Cecco explains. Opinion Last week Brazil\u2019s leftwing former leader Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva walked free from prison, in a clear threat to Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s authority as president. But as the dangers to the far-right populist\u2019s rule grow, writes the Brazilian activist David Miranda, so too do the chances that he will subvert democracy to cling to power. Bolsonaro and his movement know they cannot end Brazilian democracy without pretexts. They need disorder, protests and violence to justify a restoration of dictatorship-era measures. Sport Despite rumours that he wants to sign Real Madrid\u2019s Gareth Bale, among others, Tottenham\u2019s new manager Jos\u00e9 Mourinho has been told the club have no money to spend on players in January, and he will have to make do with the existing squad for the time being. The NBA Hall of Fame honoree Charles Barkley has apologised for making an \u201cinappropriate and unacceptable\u201d joke to a female reporter, after telling her: \u201cI don\u2019t hit women, but if I did, I would hit you.\u201d Sign up The US morning briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes every weekday.

As Canada\u2019s western provinces take an increasingly combative stance against the prime minister\u2019s environmental policies and demand support for the struggling oil and gas industry, Trudeau has tasked Chrystia Freeland with preventing a provincial feud from becoming a national crisis. Previously the foreign affairs minister, Freeland will now serve as minister of intergovernmental affairs as well as deputy prime minister, a largely symbolic role. Freeland rose to prominence leading Canada\u2019s team at lengthy trade talks with the US and Mexico, and her skills as a negotiator will probably be a key asset as she manages the relationship between the federalgovernment, provinces and territories. Freeland will also continue overseeing the relationship between Canada and the US. Trudeau also named former trade minister Jim Carr, who is suffering from cancer, to act as his special representative for Alberta, Saskatchewan and the central province of Manitoba to ensure they had \u201ca strong voice in Ottawa\u201d. Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne, an international lawyer from Quebec, will replace Freeland as minister of foreign affairs. Champagne\u2019s promotion \u2013 and the appointment of Montreal\u2019s Pablo Rodr\u00edguez as house leader, reflects the growing political heft of Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, a sovereigntist party whose support \u2013 and 32 parliamentary votes \u2013 will be critical for Trudeau\u2019s ability to govern.

O\u2019Neill stared down a warrant issued in 2014 as part of a long-running inquiry into alleged fraudulent payments of around $30m to a Port Moresby law firm, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/18/arrest-warrant-for-png-prime-minister-peter-oneill-thrown-out-of-court\">was eventually thrown out by the PNG supreme court in 2017</a>. </p> <p>Those proceedings were initiated by the muscular, multiagency Taskforce Sweep which O\u2019Neill himself established soon after gaining power in 2011, pledging zero tolerance of corruption. He shut down the taskforce days after it tried to arrest him. \u201cWhen they [Sweep investigators] became too political, I did close it down, and I had no hesitation in doing so and I would do it again,\u201d he says.</p> <p>That said, he nominates the enduring odour of corruption in PNG as a regret in reflecting on his time in power. \u201cWithout evidence, there is a perception that corruption is rife in every aspect of our society, which is a very poor reflection and poor assessment of our country.\u201d</p> <p>Of the current allegations, he says they relate to a request for funding from a health centre run by the Lutheran church in Madang in the north of the country. </p> <p>\u201cThey put a proposal to my office.

The policy delivered students, but not the resources to support them. The consequences are plain in broken-down, overcrowded classrooms across the country, and in the concerns of parents and employers about student achievement. The Guardian<em> </em>had just visited a schoolhouse in Western Province with 57 children in one multi-age class, a single teacher, few usable desks and a floor so rotten a visitor had just fallen through it.</p> <p>O\u2019Neill acknowledges these issues. \u201cBut do I make a choice about leaving kids on the street, or putting them in an environment where they can do some learning \u2026 is it fair on the girls that they are kept at home?

          "bodyText": "For a former prime minister with a warrant out for his arrest and allegations of official corruption hanging over his head, Peter O\u2019Neill is quite calm. But his breakfast order of sunny side up eggs goes cold as he responds to questions about those accusations, his leadership legacy \u2013 and those infamous Maseratis. Sitting at a corner table in the slightly frayed white-linen grandeur of Port Moresby\u2019s Crown hotel, where the deposed Papua New Guinea strongman holed up in May during the political showdown that ended his eight-year reign, he says he can\u2019t say much about the allegations investigators are levelling at him. And then says rather a lot. He is composed, but then he has been here before. O\u2019Neill stared down a warrant issued in 2014 as part of a long-running inquiry into alleged fraudulent payments of around $30m to a Port Moresby law firm, which was eventually thrown out by the PNG supreme court in 2017. Those proceedings were initiated by the muscular, multiagency Taskforce Sweep which O\u2019Neill himself established soon after gaining power in 2011, pledging zero tolerance of corruption. He shut down the taskforce days after it tried to arrest him. \u201cWhen they [Sweep investigators] became too political, I did close it down, and I had no hesitation in doing so and I would do it again,\u201d he says. That said, he nominates the enduring odour of corruption in PNG as a regret in reflecting on his time in power. \u201cWithout evidence, there is a perception that corruption is rife in every aspect of our society, which is a very poor reflection and poor assessment of our country.\u201d Of the current allegations, he says they relate to a request for funding from a health centre run by the Lutheran church in Madang in the north of the country. \u201cThey put a proposal to my office. I referred that for funding to our Community Development Fund agency, which I was responsible for. They funded it. They made payments direct to the church. So, what is wrong with that? What is corrupt about that? So, we\u2019ll test the evidence in court, but it\u2019s just rubbish. It\u2019s a politically motivated case.\u201d Last Friday, a few days after this interview, police withdrew the original warrant in the face of challenges by O\u2019Neill\u2019s lawyers over its validity, but reports indicate that the investigation is not over, and that another warrant may be in the works. Maserati-gate O\u2019Neill is rather more enthusiastic articulating his take on the legacy of his leadership. On the positive side of the ledger, he boasts of major policy achievements in education and health and \u201cunprecedented economic growth\u201d as well as PNG\u2019s successful hosting of the Apec conference last year, which \u201ccertainly put the country into a good light with the rest of the world\u201d. But the summit generated international opprobrium and domestic fury around the estimated US$135m spent on the event, including the purchase of a fleet of Maserati and Bentley vehicles on the claim they were necessary to transport world leaders including the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, the US vice-president, Mike Pence, the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, and the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison. \u201cWell, I could have bought a pushbike to take the leaders to the meeting,\u201d O\u2019Neill says. \u201cIt went to a bidding process. It was the cheapest amount of luxury cars that we could buy for the leaders. What do you expect us to pay for to transport the leaders under the secure arrangements that they deserve as global leaders?\u201d But PNG is a country with serious economic constraints, high poverty rates, battling a phalanx of consecutive disease emergencies (polio, tuberculosis, malaria and HIV) and the fallout of a devastating earthquake. Might leaders not have been content to forfeit a little luxury within that context? At this, O\u2019Neill pushes back. \u201cI think you should attend a few of these meetings and find out for yourself,\u201d he counsels. \u201cYou go to the next one in Chile and see what sort of vehicles \u2013 Audi or Mercedes or Maseratis.\u201d Since the interview, Chile announced it was withdrawing from hosting Apec as street protests raged across the country. Apec delivered substantial infrastructure to PNG, O\u2019Neill argues. \u201cLook at the roads in Port Moresby\u201d and in other major cities: Mt Hagen, Lae and Goroka. Nonetheless, as the daily, infuriated and distressed posts of ordinary citizens on social media attest, roads and infrastructure across most of the country are so poor it is all but impossible to get a bag of coffee to market or an emergency case to hospital. \u201cIt\u2019s just nonsense to think that because you live in Australia, to come and think that we\u2019ll have roads like Australia, it has taken 200 years to build that \u2026 You look at the substantial improvement in infrastructure \u2013 in ports, airports, roads, bridges.

The policy delivered students, but not the resources to support them. The consequences are plain in broken-down, overcrowded classrooms across the country, and in the concerns of parents and employers about student achievement.

O\u2019Neill acknowledges these issues. \u201cBut do I make a choice about leaving kids on the street, or putting them in an environment where they can do some learning \u2026 is it fair on the girls that they are kept at home? These are hard choices to make.\u201d Investments he initiated in curriculum and teacher training will, over time, yield improvements, he says. On health, he claims he delivered increased spending and a program of free basic healthcare throughout the country, particularly to rural and remote populations. But an Australian National University analysis identified a 37% cut in the health budget in real terms from 2014 to 2016. Doctors, health workers and aid agencies have expressed alarm about the collapse of basic health services and the medical supply chain. Public distress around the lack of health services was a focus of mass protests ahead of Apec. A national audit in 2017 documented widespread \u201cunavailability of lifesaving and essential drugs\u201d and the National Doctors Association blamed the closure of many rural health facilities for lack of supplies or workers on \u201cendemic and epidemic\u201d corruption. As to how this looks on the ground, the Guardian recounted the case of a family it encountered in Gulf Province scrambling to find 150 kina (A$63) to put fuel in an ambulance to get a teenage boy with snakebite to the nearest hospital, because the aid post was out of antivenom. (At the same aid post, a mother of six had recently died in childbirth because there was no fuel in the ambulance.) \u201cIt is more of a management problem than government not prioritising,\u201d O\u2019Neill responds. \u201cAs far as I know, funding allocations for the health sector during our term in government has been the highest by any government since independence.

A Lowy Institute analysis anticipates an overwhelming vote for independence, but O\u2019Neill warns that this could lead to a fracturing of PNG. \u201cWe\u2019ve got almost a thousand nations in this country,\u201d he says. \u201cIs the international community going to support them if any one of them decide tomorrow that \u2018we\u2019ve got a goldmine now, we\u2019ve got an oilfield now, so we want to be independent\u2019?

O\u2019Neill used it to buy a 10% stake in resources company Oil Search. When the oil price tanked over the following year, PNG lost an estimated $420m.

The veteran diplomat said that soon after taking up his posting in Kyiv he became concerned \u201cour relationship with Ukraine was being fundamentally undermined by an irregular informal channel of US policymaking, and by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/22/us-ambassador-bill-taylor-ukraine-trump-military-aid-biden\">withholding of vital security assistance for domestic political reasons</a>\u201d.

Professor Ram\u00f3n Hermida, first author of the study from the University of Vigo in Spain, said the effect was thought to be down to the bodily processes varying over a 24-hour period, meaning the same drug can have vastly different effects at different times. Separately, doctors in the US have launched a clinical trial to see whether exposure to flickering lights and low-frequency sounds can slow the progression of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.

          "bodyText": "Top story: EU likely to grant Brexit extension Hello \u2013 Warren Murray here to save you the runaround this Wednesday morning. Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit withdrawal bill is in abeyance after MPs voted to let the legislation go forward \u2013 but then blocked the PM\u2019s attempt to ram it through the House of Commons in three days. The passage of the withdrawal agreement bill (WAB) through parliament was automatically paused as a result \u2013 throwing into disarray the government\u2019s stated aim of an orderly Brexit by 31 October. The European council president, Donald Tusk, quickly suggested he would recommend the EU27 accede to the three-month delay that Johnson was previously forced by MPs to request. The prime minister and his aides will have to decide whether to seek an election \u2013 in line with a threat he made earlier in the day, which was ignored \u2013 or to draw up plans for a longer debate. Johnson may be swayed to allow more time for debate because of the larger-than-expected majority of 30 the government won for the deal in principle. But there is still his insistence that he would rather be \u201cdead in a ditch\u201d than accept a further delay. Make sure to anchor yourself to our politics live blog for all today\u2019s developments. * * * Damning Trump-Ukraine testimony \u2013 Bill Taylor, the acting US ambassador to Ukraine, has told congressional committees considering whether to impeach Donald Trump of efforts involving Rudy Giuliani that were focused solely on getting Ukraine\u2019s president to announce investigations that would damage Joe Biden. The veteran diplomat said that soon after taking up his posting in Kyiv he became concerned \u201cour relationship with Ukraine was being fundamentally undermined by an irregular informal channel of US policymaking, and by the withholding of vital security assistance for domestic political reasons\u201d. Democrats are calling Taylor\u2019s testimony the clearest account to date of Trump\u2019s abuse of office in the Ukraine scandal. Taylor flew to Washington to testify in defiance of a gag attempt by the Trump administration. * * * Midweek catch-up &gt; The presidents of Russia and Turkey have agreed on a proposed Turkish-administered \u201csafe zone\u201d in Syria. It is a blow to the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) who are being told to pull back 18 miles from their positions on the border before Turkish and Russian soldiers begin joint patrols. &gt; China is reportedly planning to replace Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam with an \u201cinterim\u201d chief executive but wants pro-democracy protests to die down first. Speculation over Lam\u2019s future came as the man whose murder case prompted the extradition bill that set off months of protests was released from prison. &gt; Mark Zuckerberg will tell Congress today he is willing to delay the launch of Facebook\u2019s cryptocurrency venture Libra amid growing pushback from legislators and the pullout of major payment companies like Mastercard, PayPal, Stripe and Visa. &gt; After Canada\u2019s federal election, rival party leaders have begun laying out their conditions to support Justin Trudeau as head of a minority government. Vying for a slice of power are the cash-strapped New Democratic party and the nominally separatist Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. &gt; Deliveroo\u2019s highest paid director, understood to be the co-founder Will Shu, received a near 57% increase in basic pay and \u00a38.3m in share options last year, despite widening losses at the food delivery firm. * * * Heart pills better at night \u2013 Taking blood pressure medication at bedtime rather than on waking halves the risk of events such as heart attack and stroke, a major study has revealed. Professor Ram\u00f3n Hermida, first author of the study from the University of Vigo in Spain, said the effect was thought to be down to the bodily processes varying over a 24-hour period, meaning the same drug can have vastly different effects at different times. Separately, doctors in the US have launched a clinical trial to see whether exposure to flickering lights and low-frequency sounds can slow the progression of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Animal tests have shown that exposure to light and sound waves at 40Hz appears to boost the activity of the brain\u2019s immune cells that remove defective proteins. And a US company has revived its previously shelved experimental Alzheimer\u2019s therapy, known as aducanumab, claiming that in high doses it helps slow patients\u2019 decline in cognitive ability and activities. * * * Cabs make electric switch \u2013 London is to get its first fully electric black cabs since 1899. They didn\u2019t take off back then, when most cabs were horse-drawn. Now, the Dynamo, a taxi converted from a Nissan electric van in a Coventry factory, will help drivers in \u201cdoing their bit to improve our filthy air\u201d, says the London mayor, Sadiq Khan. Meanwhile the Liberal Democrats are pushing for a legally binding \u201cduty of care\u201d on environmental and social issues for companies. It would prevent them selling goods from deforested areas and force them to investigate their overseas supply chains for exploitative practices such as modern slavery and the use of child labour. * * * Missing a culinary trick \u2013 More than 8m pumpkins comprising over 18,000 tonnes of edible pumpkin flesh will go in Britain\u2019s bins this Halloween. The environmental charity Hubbub said: \u201cIt\u2019s all too easy for people to forget that Halloween pumpkins are still food. When they are only used for carving this contributes to the \u00a315bn of food waste in UK homes every year.\u201d Britain\u2019s first commercially brewed beer made from pumpkin flesh that would otherwise go to waste will go on sale at the end of November. Toast Ale, a social enterprise, will brew the Belgian-style pumpkin dubbel. Today in Focus podcast: Fox and Trump \u2013 a parting? Luke O\u2019Neil on whether things are starting to sour in the powerful relationship between Donald Trump and his favourite TV network. Plus: Jonathan Franklin on the protests in Chile that have turned deadly. Lunchtime read: See you later, Gladiator Warrior, Raider, Hunter, Saracen and Trojan; Falcon, Rhino, Cobra, Nightshade, Wolf and Panther; Amazon, Vogue, Lightning, Jet and Zodiac. They were the champions of 90s Saturday-night TV, overpowering opponents in action-packed, foam-based contests. But where are they now, 20 years later? Sirin Kale finds out. Sport The countdown is on to the Rugby World Cup semi-finals, and Bath wing Anthony Watson is confident England can upset the All Blacks to book a spot in the decider. The mind games are well and truly on in Tokyo, with England coach Eddie Jones claiming his team were spied on as they prepared for the clash with New Zealand. In Champions League football, Raheem Sterling bagged a second-half hat-trick as Manchester City crushed Atalanta 5-0. Tottenham Hotspur enjoyed an equally facile win over Red Star Belgrade, but Barney Ronay writes the opposition was so poor it\u2019s difficult to get too excited with the performance. Back to the Rugby World Cup, and Wales defence coach Shaun Edwards says his side must be ready for a blowtorch of speed from South Africa in their semi-final. Business Asian stock markets have followed Wall Street lower after major companies reported mixed earnings and Donald Tusk said he would recommend that the EU grant a delay to Brexit. Benchmarks in Shanghai, Tokyo and Hong Kong all declined. The US share retreat was led by a tech sell-off as investors weighed mixed earnings from McDonald\u2019s, Procter &amp; Gamble and other big companies. The pound has been trading around $1.284 and \u20ac1.156 while the FTSE is tracking ever so slightly lower ahead of the open. The papers Most of today\u2019s papers \u2013 whose fronts pages you can see here \u2013 blame parliament for the latest sting in the Brexit tale. \u201cBrexit is in purgatory,\u201d says the Telegraph, with later versions of the story saying the PM has \u201cput Britain on a general election footing\u201d after Tuesday\u2019s setback. The Guardian says MPs blocked Johnson\u2019s timetable even after he threatened to pull the bill and call for a general election. The Sun deploys Little Britain\u2019s Vicky Pollard to interpret the two votes with the headline: \u201cYeah but no but \u2026\u201d The Mail says \u201cTrust this lot [MPs] to turn triumph into disaster!\u201d and the Express accuses MPs of \u201cyet more dithering\u201d. The Times nudges Brexit into a picture slot, saying the PM is \u201cfrustrated\u201d. The FT says Johnson has won a landmark vote but been \u201cthwarted\u201d on the deadline. The Mirror and the i use the Halloween idea to say \u201cPM\u2019s Brexit horror\u201d and \u201cJohnson\u2019s Halloween Brexit in tatters\u201d.
