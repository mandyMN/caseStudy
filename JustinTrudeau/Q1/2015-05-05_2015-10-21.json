          "bodyText": "Australian forces in air and training missions in the Middle East are prepared for chemical weapon attacks by Isis, as coalition forces warn of an increased threat. The Australian defence chief, Mark Binskin, offered an update on operations in Iraq and Syria during Senate estimates on Wednesday. He said coalition partners had been aware of possible chemical weapons usage by Isis, also known as Daesh. \u201cThe one area that we have increased our force protection that\u2019s been an emerging threat \u2026 is the use of some limited chemical weapons by Daesh,\u201d Binskin said. He said chlorine weapons and sulphur mustard, known colloquially as mustard gas, were the biggest threats from Isis. Mustard gas is a blister agent that causes severe burning when it comes in contact with skin. The United Nations\u2019 chemical weapons convention banned the use of mustard gas and other chemical weapons in 1993. Binskin said Australian troops, who were on the ground in Iraq on a training mission and engaged in airstrikes over both Iraq and Syria, had not been the target of chemical attacks. Despite that, they remained prepared, the defence chief said. \u201cWe have adapted our force posture to be able to respond to that [threat],\u201d he said. The Australian foreign minister, Julie Bishop, indicated in June that Isis was recruiting chemical experts to develop prohibited weaponry for use in Iraq and Syria. \u201cDaesh is likely to have amongst its tens of thousands of recruits, the technical expertise necessary to further refine precursor materials and build chemical weapons,\u201d Bishop said. \u201cThe fact that atrocities such as this continue to occur shows that we must remain vigilant to the threat of chemical and biological weapons.\u201d Binskin outlined the cost of operation Okra, Australia\u2019s air mission in Iraq, during his questioning in the Senate. In the 2014-15 financial year, the operation cost taxpayers $159.4m and that figure was expected to rise to $390m this financial year. In September, the then prime minister, Tony Abbott, announced that Australian airstrikes against Isis would extend beyond Iraq into parts of Syria. Russia\u2019s decision to enter the Syrian war, ostensibly to defeat Isis but also to bolster support for the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, had not changed Australia\u2019s mission, Binskin said. However, he admitted it had added to the \u201ccomplexity\u201d of the conflict. While the number of missions into Syria were \u201cclassified\u201d, Binskin said there \u201chave not been a lot\u201d. He said the rate of successful deployment of weaponry was in the \u201chigh 90s\u201d. About 530 weapons had been released since the start of the Iraqi mission, which was announced in October 2014. The breakdown of missions over Iraq, conducted by various aircraft, are as follows: \u2022 E74 wedgetails early warning aircraft \u2013 150 missions \u2022 KC-30A air-to-air refuelling aircraft \u2013 430 missions \u2022 FA18 superhornets \u2013 210 missions \u2022 FA 18 classic hornets \u2013 250 missions Canada\u2019s prime minister-elect, Justin Trudeau, has rung Barack Obamato inform him that Canada will withdraw from the mission in Iraq and Syria. Trudeau, who was elected on Monday, did not offer a timeframe as to when Canadian forces would pull out.",

Writing on Facebook, Hunt said the Canadian result showed \u201cvoters want strong leadership from an articulate, engaged, and convincing politician, with a well-managed party behind them.\u201d Here are <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/LabourTristram/posts/1657663807814015:0\">Hunt\u2019s five takeaways from Canada\u2019s poll</a>. </p> <ol> <li>Optimism works. Justin Trudeau did not win on a miserabilist account of the state of modern Canada. His was a passionate, patriotic, optimistic vision of what Canada could and should be. It was not a tale of woe; but a story of hope. As he put it, \u201cSunny ways, my friends, sunny ways.\u201d<br></li> <li>Tory hegemony is not inevitable. The victory of Trudeau means the removal of Stephen Harper \u2013 a man whose ambition was to turn the Conservative Party into the natural governing party of Canada. The virtue of democracy is its glorious ability to overturn inevitability.<br></li> <li>The offer of a new political economy. Smartly, Trudeau outmanoeuvred the more left-wing New Democratic Party on \u2018three modest deficits\u2019 for infrastructure spending and tax rises for the wealthiest (alongside tax cuts for middle income earners). This was essentially Labour Policy at the 2015 General Election. The difference is that Trudeau leaned into it; spelt it out in primary colours; and had confidence in the message. To me, this is a question about trust: can the leadership and the party be trusted to deliver more radical policies on economic redistribution? In May, the British Labour Party failed that test. In Canada, Trudeau showed it can be done.<br></li> <li>Leadership is key. Voters want strong leadership from an articulate, engaged, and convincing politician, with a well-managed party behind them.</li> <li>Lynton Crosby is fallible. The man, and his candidates, can be beaten.</li> </ol> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56262b1ee4b00378ab588c12\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-10-20T12:05:10.095Z\">1.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"http://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/harper-cabinet-ministers-ndp-critics-who-lost-their-seat-1.2617562\">CTV lists the high-profile politicians who lost</a> their seats in the election.

The Liberal platform also successfully countered the Conservatives\u2019 fearful message that voting for anyone other than the incumbents meant putting the economy at risk. The Liberals similarly outflanked an NDP that chose to sell itself as closer on the fiscal spectrum to Mr. Harper. In the end, the NDP ended up seeing much of its vote shift massively and suddenly to the Liberals in Quebec and Ontario.

          "bodyText": "We\u2019re going to power down the liveblog after nearly two days of rolling coverage. Here\u2019s a look back at the last 36 hours in Canadian politics. Thanks for reading! Justin Trudeau and his Liberal party swept to power in a stunning victory over the Conservative government of Stephen Harper, taking 184 seats. Canadians in every province voted for Liberal candidates, who won in striking victories in greater Toronto and Quebec. At a rally in Ottawa on Tuesday, Trudeau told supporters and volunteers that the \u201cwork had only just begun\u201d. The prime minister-designate announced during his first press conference since winning a majority that he plans to unveil his cabinet on 4 November \u2013 one that has equal gender balance. The Liberal leader said he was pleased voters responded to positively to the party\u2019s \u201cconcrete but ambitious\u201d vision. Now he beings the process of trying to implement it. Trudeau had a \u201cvery warm conversation\u201d with US president Barack Obama about the countries climate change goals, the Keystone pipeline, the fight against the Islamic State group, the Trans Pacific Partnership trade agreement, strengthening bilateral relations \u2013 and Trudeau\u2019s hair. Trudeau said Obama \u201cunderstands\u201d his commitment to withdraw Canada\u2019s fighter jets from Iraq and Syria, but did not offer a timeline. Canada\u2019s cannabis industry is seeing green after Trudeau reiterated his plans to legalize marijuana Canada\u2019s political landscape has shifted dramatically since 2011, in three maps. Asked how he felt about the Liberals\u2019 smashing victory, Trudeau responded: \u201cI feel good about how the campaign went. I feel good about the kind of messages that we were able to share with Canadians and the response they gave to message of pulling people together in a positive way ... \u201cI\u2019m also very, very aware of both the opportunity and the responsibility that we have to live up to, having put forward a strong vision for growth, for unity, for positivity in this country. We now get to start working on delivering that.\u201d Here\u2019s our latest round-up of Trudeau\u2019s first day as PM-designate: While we work up a summary on the day\u2019s events, here\u2019s video of an 18-year-old Justin Trudeau debate Quebecois independence. CBC first aired this story in 1990. The White House on the Obama-Trudeau phone call The two leaders agreed on the importance of deepening the already strong United States-Canada relationship and committed to strengthening the countries\u2019 joint efforts to promote trade, combat terrorism, and mitigate climate change. In particular, they noted the successful conclusion of Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations and the need to move forward with implementing the high standards of the agreement, which promises to boost economic growth and support good-paying jobs on both sides of the border. They committed to work together to achieve an ambitious and durable global climate agreement in Paris in December. Trudeau is asked if he will commit to a concrete emissions reduction target ahead of the Paris summit on climate change at the end of November. He said he will be meeting with other premiers ahead of the summit, and that the days of Canada being less than willing to act on the file are over. Trudeau said he is planning to attend the G20 summit in Turkey, as well as other global conferences. He said he needs to balance the need to get a government up and running in Canada with the country\u2019s commitments on the world stage. Trudeau said he spoke to President Barak Obama about an hour ago. He said the world leaders discussed his commitment to end Canada\u2019s bombing mission against ISIS in Iraq and Syria \u2013 a campaign promise \u2013 but didn\u2019t commit to a timeframe, saying he will move forward with withdrawal in a \u201cresponsible fashion\u201d. What accounts for last night\u2019s success? \u201cI think Canadians had an extraordinary desire for change, \u201d Trudeau told reporters. He said the Liberal party\u2019s \u201cconcrete but ambitious vision\u201d inspired voters. Trudeau said he will unveil his cabinet on 4 November, about two weeks from now. He said he aims to set up a cabinet that achieves gender balance. Characterizing his conversation with Obama, Trudeau said it was very \u201cwarm\u201d. The leaders spoke about their children, and Obama encouraged the young leader to take advantage of every moment with them because the grow quickly. Trudeau said Obama also teased him about his lack of gray hair and said that he would likely get some grays soon \u2013 just like him. On a serious note, he said the leaders discussed the fight against ISIS, the Keystone pipeline, the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations and the importance of deepening their bilateral relationship. \u201cI indicated to Mr Obama that I felt it was important Canada demonstrates a level of positive engagement on the environmental file\u201d Trudeau said. In addition to Obama, Trudeau said he also spoke with UK prime minister David Cameron, French president Francois Hollande, Italy Prime Minster Matteo Renzi. His first conversation on Monday night was with Mexico president Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto. Asked how he feels about the big victory, Trudeau responded: \u201cI feel good about how the campaign went. I feel good about the kind of messages that we were able to share with Canadians and the response they gave to message of pulling people together in a positive way rather than the strategic division that has been a part of Canadian elections for so long ...\u201d \u201cI\u2019m also very aware of both the opportunity and responsibility that we have to live up to having put up a strong vision.\u201d While we wait for Trudeau\u2019s inaugural press conference, some fun facts. h/t Tom McCarthy President Barack Obama has also congratulated Justin Trudeau and his Liberal party on their stunning victory Monday night, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said during Tuesday\u2019s briefing. The president was expected to call Trudeau to congratulate him on Tuesday, Earnest said. He said Obama would also call Harper at some point in the near future to thank him for his leadership. Earnest was asked if the White House thinks the bilateral relationship will \u201cget easier\u201d with the Liberal leader in power. Relations with Harper deteriorated over the Obama administration\u2019s still pending decision over the Keystone XL pipeline, which the outgoing Conservative leader had lobbied Washington to approve. \u201cWell, I think it would be short-sighted to reduce the relationship between our two countries to just one issue,\u201d Earnest said. News with a view: Ready or not, here comes Trudeau Voters made clear on Monday that Stephen Harper\u2019s rightwing decade has run its course but Justin Trudeau\u2019s victorious Liberals face tough choices about priorities, the Guardian\u2019s editorial board wrote of the result. The Liberals victory \u201cmarks a big political shift to the centre-left in a crucial G7 power, and the victory of Canada\u2019s Liberals also has lessons for politics across the developed world\u201d. It is hardly surprising that Canadians have voted for change rather than more of the same. Mr Harper\u2019s vindictive and divisive style, his addiction to shrinking the government, his authoritarian tendencies and his failure to offer anything new this time after a contentious if successful decade in office had clearly run their course. One in three Canadians continued to back Mr Harper all the same. But the two in three who wanted rid of him finally gathered behind Mr Trudeau and sent NDP hopes of heading Canada\u2019s first leftwing government of modern times back to the drawing board. Harper\u2019s out, right? And Trudeau\u2019s not in yet ... So who\u2019s running Canada? The queen? No! The mounties? No! Ace reporter Jessica Murphy explains that Harper will continue to serve as the prime minister until Trudeau is sworn in, likely in time to attend the G-20 summit in Turkey, which is on 15 November. Meanwhile, Canada will remain under a \u201ccaretaker convention\u201d, as it was during the election cycle, while the new liberal government is formed. Stephen Harper will remain an MP while his party elects an interim leader, CBC has reported. Harper did not say he would resign from his post during his concession speech last night, but a brief statement released by his party indicated that he would leave his post. On Tuesday, Conservative party president John Walsh elaborated, saying that Harper would remain an MP in his riding of Calgary Heritage and that the party would elect an interim leader \u201cas soon as possible\u201d, according to CBC. Democratic presidential hopeful Martin O\u2019Malley, whose politics align more closely with Canada\u2019s new leader than Rubio\u2019s, also congratulated Trudeau and his Liberal party on their victory on Twitter. Florida Senator Marco Rubio, who is seeking the Republican nomination in the US presidential elections, has congratulated Canada on being a lot like its southern neighbor. \u201cWe share a long history with our friends to the north,\u201d Rubio said in a statement on Tuesday, \u201cincluding a commitment to democratic ideals and the peaceful transition of power.\u201d He congratulated Justin Trudeau on his victory and thanked outgoing Prime Minister Stephen Harper for his leadership and \u201ccommitment to the US-Canadian relationship\u201d. I look forward to continuing close cooperation with Canada on mutual interests through projects such as the Keystone XL pipeline and the policies needed to keep our citizens safe. Prime Minister in waiting Justin Trudeau is addressing supporters at the Ottawa. You can follow along here. \u201cSunny ways, my friends, sunny ways,\u201d Trudeau says, repeating a line from his acceptance speech last night. \u201cThis is what positive politics can do. This is what a positive,hopeful vision ... can make happen.\u201d \u201cHow ya feeling?\u201d he asks, the crowd of supporters and volunteers. They erupt in cheers. He then thanks them first in English and then in French. \u201cI know that none of it would have been possible without all of you. You should be proud too. Thank YOU.\u201d Trudeau said getting out the liberal vote required 80,000 volunteers who together made nearly 13 million door knocks and phone calls. \u201cBy any measure that is incredibly impressive,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom the bottom of my heart, Thank you.\u201d He continued in French: \u201cThe work is only beginning. We have pledged to form a government \u2013 a government that invests in the future.\u201d \u201cToday we can celebrate, but our hard work is just beginning,\u201d he said. He gets loud cheers for saying his government will listen to scientists, a dig at his predecessor who muzzled discussions on climate change. Trudeau said many worried Canada had lost its compassionate spirit over the past nearly 10 years. Monday\u2019s vote, he said, sent a \u201csimple message\u201d to the world. On behalf of 35 million Canadians, we\u2019re back. \u201cThis is is Canada and in Canada,\u201d he says, and the crowd chimes in to finish the sentence, \u201cbetter is always possible.\u201d Trudeau then shakes hands with the party\u2019s most faithful. He expected to give a press conference at 5pm \u2013 the significance of which we have detailed here. We\u2019re just waiting for the rally to get underway in Ottawa, where Trudeau is expected to address the crowd any minute now ... Justin Trudeau, Canada\u2019s Liberal prime-minister-in-waiting, is marking his first day with a symbolic outreach to Ottawa\u2019s press corps, our reporter Jessica Murphy writes. Trudeau\u2019s inaugural news conference is to be held Tuesday afternoon in the National Press Theatre, a venue outgoing Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper mostly avoided during his nearly ten years in office. News conferences in the Theatre \u2013 across from the Parliament Hill in Ottawa on the ground floor of the National Press Building \u2013 are moderated and managed by the Parliamentary Press Gallery. The relationship between outgoing Harper and the national media can be described as frosty at best and easily outright hostile - in part because he distrusted the Ottawa-based press, which he viewed as cheerleaders for the former Liberal establishment he\u2019d worked so hard to sweep from power. And he maintained the strict centralized, top-down message control implemented in his government\u2019s early days when he was first elected in 2006 with a caucus full of rookie MPs. His news conference also became few-and-far between and were often limited to a maximum of four questions. Time will tell whether Trudeau\u2019s openness with the press extends beyond symbolism, though the Liberal platform did include promises to improve government transparency. I know, we shared this yesterday. But it\u2019s so funny that we\u2019re sharing it again. Canadian actor William Shatner offers newly-elected prime minister Justin Trudeau some public speaking advice. Sunny ways and hazy days are to come, Canada\u2019s newly elected prime minister has promised. Following liberal\u2019s decisive electoral victory, prime minister-designate Justin Trudeau said on Monday night that he will \u201clegalize, regulate, and restrict access to marijuana\u201d. My colleague Rupert Neate reports on what this important milestone would mean for the nation\u2019s cannabis industry. \u201cTrudeau\u2019s vow to legalise and regulate marijuana the \u2018right way\u2019 has set in motion the single most important catalyst for the marijuana space,\u201d said Aaron Salz, an analyst at Dundee Capital Markets. Legalising cannabis had been a key plank of Trudeau\u2019s campaign and he had promised to work towards legalising it \u201cright away\u201d. \u201cWe don\u2019t yet know exactly what rate we\u2019re going to be taxing it, how we\u2019re going to control it, or whether it will happen in the first months, within the first year, or whether it\u2019s going to take a year or two to kick in,\u201d Trudeau said in the run-up to Monday night\u2019s vote. After the revelry comes the real work \u2013 and Canada\u2019s young leader sure has his work cut out. Jessica Murphy reports on Justin Trudeau\u2019s ambitious policy agenda. Trudeau, 43, and his team set the bar high in their campaign platform, promising sweeping policy changes on everything from drug laws \u2013 he pledged to legalize marijuana \u2013 to the appointment of senators, climate change policy, and relationships with Canada\u2019s Aboriginal population. The Liberals have also committed to increasing \u2013 and fast-tracking \u2013 the number of Syrian refugees brought into Canada from 10,000 to 25,000, boosting foreign aid, scrapping Canada\u2019s purchase of F-35 fighter jets, and ending the country\u2019s combat efforts in the US-led coalition against Isis in Iraq. On pocketbook issues, they have pledged to slash taxes for the middle class while raising them for the wealthiest Canadians and rolling out an infrastructure plan that will put the country into three consecutive deficit budgets. And their campaign pledges include a wide variety of electoral reforms, from eliminating the country\u2019s \u201cfirst-past-the-post\u201d system of electing governments to studying measures like mandatory and online voting. Let\u2019s hope the pressure doesn\u2019t take a toll on his world-class locks. Justin Trudeau will hold a press conference in the National Press Theatre in Ottawa on Tuesday \u2013 something of foreign concept for the journalists who covered Stephen Harper for the last nine years. The New York Times recently characterized Harper\u2019s relationship with the press as \u201cone of outright hostility\u201d. At his notoriously brief news conferences, his handlers vet every journalist, picking and choosing who can ask questions. In the usual give-and-take between press and politicians, the hurly-burly of any healthy democracy, he has simply removed the give. As of December 2014, Harper had held only one news conference in the National Press Theatre since first sweeping to power in 2006, according to the Hill Times. The paper also found that compared to the other G8 leaders, Harper was the \u201cleast likely of the major leaders to open up to journalists who cover them and their governments on a daily basis\u201d. On Twitter, political journalists reacted to the news of a press conference. We are expecting to hear from Prime Minister-designate Justin Trudeau in just about two hours from now, at 2pm EST, at a rally with supporters in Ottawa, according to his press office. During the 78-day election cycle, Stephen Harper ran attack ads against Trudeau that said of the young leader: \u201cHe\u2019s just not ready.\u201d A cartoonist for the Edmonton Journal ran with that notion. A lot can change in four years and, as evidenced by last night\u2019s Canadian elections, a lot did change. In three maps, my colleagues Alberto Nardelli and Glenn Swann show just how much Canada\u2019s political landscape has changed since 2011. I\u2019m taking over this liveblog for my colleague Matthew Weaver as we continue our rolling coverage of the Canadian election. I\u2019ll get started with a graphic from Maclean\u2019s that neatly summarises the 43rd Parliament by party, gender and age. It also tallies how many members of parliament are indigenous, visible minorities and whether they\u2019re a newcomer or incumbent. By the numbers \u2013 There are 89 women in this Parliament, meaning they now hold 26.3% of seats \u2013 a 2 percentage point increase from the last Parliament, according to the magazine. And 2.7% of MPs in our new Parliament are Indigenous, up very little from 2.3% in the previous House. Trudeau is expected to give a press conference in the next four hours or so. In it he may provide hints as to who will serve in his first cabinet. CTV provides profiles of the leading cabinet contenders. Those hoping for a U-turn in Canada\u2019s climate change policy after Stephen Harper\u2019s crushing defeat are in for a reality check, warns Suzanne Goldenberg. Trudeau has repudiated Harper\u2019s vision of Canada as an \u201cenergy superpower\u201d, promised to reverse devastating cuts to government science budgets, and fix the country\u2019s reputation as a carbon bully in international climate negotiations. But it would be a mistake to see Trudeau or the Liberals as climate champions. In his victory speech on Monday, there was no mention of climate change, and he was criticised for being vague on the issue during campaigning. Trudeau committed to take part in the Paris climate conference at the end of the year, and to convene a meeting of provincial leaders within 90 days to come up with a plan to fight climate change. His party\u2019s campaign platform called for the setting up of a $2bn fund to help projects that promote clean energy. However, Trudeau supports the Keystone XL pipeline \u2013 Canada\u2019s bid to find new markets for its vast carbon reserves in the Alberta tar sands \u2013 a position that puts the Liberal leader at odds with campaigners and with Barack Obama. Turnout for the election was significantly up on previous polls, according to Elections Canada. With 99.8% of the vote counted it reported a turnout of 68.49% a big increase on the turnout in the 61.1% turnout in 2011 and the 58.8% recorded in 2008. Anti-monarchy campaigners have welcomed the departure of Stephen Harper, who angered republicans by trying to raise the profile of the Queen in Canada during his tenure as prime minister. Graham Smith, chief executive of Republic, tweeted he was \u201cvery happy Harper is out of power\u201d. Clarification: Smith later pointed out that he made the comment in a personal capacity. A poll in 2008 found that less than a quarter of Canadians knew that the Queen was nominally Canada\u2019s head of state. Harper wanted to change that, and ordered pictures of the Queen to be displayed in government buildings. This controversially involved replacing paintings by contemporary Quebec artists at the Department of Foreign Affairs. Justin Trudeau\u2019s stance on the monarchy is harder to pin down. In May this year he tweeted congratulations to the the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge after the birth of Princess Charlotte. But he has also said he is open to debate about the role of monarchy in Canada. In what appeared to be a deliberately ambiguous letter to Canada\u2019s Monarchist League he wrote: My view is that severing our centuries-old connection to the monarchy is not a decision to be made lightly. The monarchy remains a cornerstone of Canada\u2019s foundation, and any debate surrounding changes to this institution must include as many Canadians as possible in the discussion. Canada\u2019s image abroad now has sex appeal judging by the reception to Trudeau\u2019s win in some quarters. Will Trudeau ratify TTIP the controversial trade deal? During the campaign, he said he supported free trade but would need to see the text of the agreement before deciding whether to sign it. But Trudeau\u2019s statement on TTIP suggested that he objected to the secret way the deal was agreed rather than its substance. He said: \u201cThe Trans-Pacific Partnership stands to remove trade barriers, widely expand free trade for Canada, and increase opportunities for our middle class and those working hard to join it. Liberals will take a responsible approach to thoroughly examining the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The Harper Conservatives have failed to be transparent through the entirety of the negotiations \u2013 especially in regards to what Canada is conceding in order to be accepted into this partnership. \u201cThe government has an obligation to be open and honest about the negotiation process, and immediately share all the details of any agreement. Canadians deserve to know what impacts this agreement will have on different industries across our country. The federal government must keep its word and defend Canadian interests during the TPP\u2019s ratification process \u2013 which includes defending supply management, our auto sector, and Canadian manufacturers across the country. \u201cIf the Liberal Party of Canada earns the honour of forming a government after October 19th, we will hold a full and open public debate in Parliament to ensure Canadians are consulted on this historic trade agreement.\u201d A graphic from the Toronto Star neatly summarises how the Liberals swept away so many Conservatives in and around Toronto (known as the 905 area because of its telephone code). Justin Trudeau was described as likeable but hardly a sure fire success for the Liberal party in a confidential US state department cable in 2009, writes Mark Tran. The cable, obtained by WikiLeaks, analyses the state of the Liberal party, then under the leadership of Michael Ignatieff, who had just taken over from the discredited Stephane Dion in dramatic fashion in December 2008. Ignatieff is described as the Liberal\u2019s newest and best hope after years in the political wilderness. \u201cUrban, articulate, bilingual, and with an impressive rolodex of contacts around the world - including in the new Obama Administration \u2013 Ignatieff represented the Liberals\u2019 newest and best hope that they could reverse their several years-long slide and emerge in the next election,\u201d said the state department. But the US official goes on to describe Ignatieff as someone who is out of touch, who \u201cjust doesn\u2019t listen,\u201d the same flaw most attributed to Dion. As to who might be a stronger candidate to lead the Liberals, the official says there is no obvious replacement. \u201cThe only name that still comes up is Bob Rae - another 62-year-old white male from Toronto - who has now lost the leadership sweepstakes twice and who has privately insisted that his sole remaining political ambition is to be foreign minister. Many Liberals are concerned that the \u201cnew blood\u201d of the Liberal Party is apparently so anemic, with no real stars on the horizon - apart from Justin Trudeau, who most describe as eminently likeable but sadly prone to stray off script - not the sure-fire leadership a successful Liberal party will need.\u201d Labour MP Tristram Hunt, has become the latest internal critic of Jeremy Corbyn, to use Trudeau\u2019s victory to attack the party\u2019s leaders (see earlier for more). Writing on Facebook, Hunt said the Canadian result showed \u201cvoters want strong leadership from an articulate, engaged, and convincing politician, with a well-managed party behind them.\u201d Here are Hunt\u2019s five takeaways from Canada\u2019s poll. Optimism works. Justin Trudeau did not win on a miserabilist account of the state of modern Canada. His was a passionate, patriotic, optimistic vision of what Canada could and should be. It was not a tale of woe; but a story of hope. As he put it, \u201cSunny ways, my friends, sunny ways.\u201d Tory hegemony is not inevitable. The victory of Trudeau means the removal of Stephen Harper \u2013 a man whose ambition was to turn the Conservative Party into the natural governing party of Canada. The virtue of democracy is its glorious ability to overturn inevitability. The offer of a new political economy. Smartly, Trudeau outmanoeuvred the more left-wing New Democratic Party on \u2018three modest deficits\u2019 for infrastructure spending and tax rises for the wealthiest (alongside tax cuts for middle income earners). This was essentially Labour Policy at the 2015 General Election. The difference is that Trudeau leaned into it; spelt it out in primary colours; and had confidence in the message. To me, this is a question about trust: can the leadership and the party be trusted to deliver more radical policies on economic redistribution? In May, the British Labour Party failed that test. In Canada, Trudeau showed it can be done. Leadership is key. Voters want strong leadership from an articulate, engaged, and convincing politician, with a well-managed party behind them. Lynton Crosby is fallible. The man, and his candidates, can be beaten. CTV lists the high-profile politicians who lost their seats in the election. Among the casualties in Stephen Harper\u2019s cabinet were the finance minister Joe Oliver, the citizenship and immigration minister Chris Alexander and Bernard Valcourt, the minister minister of aboriginal affairs and Northern development. The lists also includes several shadow cabinet members from the New Democratic Party after the official opposition only secured 44 seats. They included the party\u2019s environment spokeswoman Megan Leslie. Here\u2019s the final seat tally World leaders continue to pass on their best wishes to Trudeau (as well as boilerplate sentiments about relations with Canada). They include messages from the leaders of Malaysia, Luxembourg and Mexico. So far there\u2019s been no official word yet from David Cameron, but foreign office minister, Hugo Swire, has congratulated Trudeau. Justin Trudeau\u2019s victory has prompted a collective trawl through the photo archives of pictures of the future PM at the feet of his father Pierre who led Canada for more than 15 years. But according to Bloomberg\u2019s Josh Wingrove Justin owes more to his grandfather. Trudeau\u2019s political role model is not so much his beloved \u201cpapa,\u201d whose public persona over 15 years as prime minister mixed charisma and aloofness, but his maternal grandfather, Jimmy Sinclair, a consummate glad-handing, baby-kissing Scottish immigrant to Canada and Rhodes scholar. It was no accident that Trudeau held his final campaign event Sunday night in the Vancouver constituency his grandfather represented from 1940 to 1958. The Globe and Mail newspaper, which is often regarded as the paper of the Canadian establishment, says Trudeau outmanoeuvred his opponents. In an editorial on the result it says: Mr. Trudeau had the advantage of running against a tired party and a leader who had been in office for nearly a decade \u2013 but so did Tom Mulcair and the New Democratic Party. Mr. Trudeau cannily allowed his opponents to lower expectations about him, and then out-campaigned two party leaders who spent millions of dollars on advertising that sought to portray them as more experienced and better suited to the job of prime minister. His optimism and openness, combined with solid performances in multiple debates, undid the Conservatives\u2019 strategy of presenting the Liberal leader as \u201cjust not ready.\u201d It may yet prove to be true in government, but it was not on the campaign trail. The Liberal platform also successfully countered the Conservatives\u2019 fearful message that voting for anyone other than the incumbents meant putting the economy at risk. The Liberals similarly outflanked an NDP that chose to sell itself as closer on the fiscal spectrum to Mr. Harper. In the end, the NDP ended up seeing much of its vote shift massively and suddenly to the Liberals in Quebec and Ontario. Voters went to the party that could knock off Mr. Harper. What happens next? Trudeau is expected to give his first press conference on Tuesday as prime minister-designate, but it could be several days or even weeks before he is officially sworn in. The swearing-in ceremony is expected to take place before the G20 summit in Turkey which starts on 15 November, according to the Globe and Mail. But first he will need to form a cabinet. Trudeau has pledged to appoint an equal number of men and women to his front bench. The key appointments to watch will be the finance minister and foreign minister. One of Trudeau senior advisers, Robert Asselin, said parliament could return within the next two weeks to usher in the new government. The privy council office has been instructed to start the transition and the Liberal team will begin to engage with officials Tuesday, he told the Hill Times. \u201cThe earlier the better,\u201d he said. The size of Trudeau\u2019s victory means the transition is likely to be swifter than usual. During the campaign Trudeau promised that his first legislation as prime minister will be to raise taxes for the rich and lower them for the middle classes. It will lower the tax rate on income earned between $45,000 and $90,000, and create a new tax bracket for income over $200,000. For the Conservative Party the next job will choosing a new leader to replace Stephen Harper. Outgoing defence minister Jason Kenney is widely considered the front-runner, according to CBC. But it names five other possible contenders including Kellie Leitch the outgoing minister of status of women. Here\u2019s the Guardian\u2019s latest news story on the Canadian election results. And our picture desk has put together a gallery of Trudeau\u2019s victory. Some Canadian voters were still queuing to vote when broadcasters were calling the victory for Trudeau and his Liberal party, Global News reports. The voting hours were staggered across the country\u2019s different time zones so that the majority of results were available at approximately the same time. But it left some voters feeling that their vote wouldn\u2019t count. Global News reports: Frustration erupted on social media from many voters in Western Canada Monday night, apparently upset that a Liberal government was called before the polls closed in their province. \u201cHow relevant can the voters in B.C. feel if the election is called while they are still in line to vote,\u201d said one Twitter user. Global News and several other media outlets called a Liberal government shortly after 9:30 p.m. ET. However, the polls remained open in B.C., where some voters were still in line to cast their ballot as the election was called. Fair tax campaign and adviser to Jeremy Corbyn, Richard Murphy, claims that Trudeau won by campaigning to the left of the NDP on economics. Writing on his blog, he says: When will the right wing of social democratic parties realise that you can\u2019t win an election by claiming to be on the left and yet offer austerity? Time after time it fails, and rightly so. And it will in the UK again unless Labour does really embrace what it means to be on the economic left. Trudeau\u2019s victory has exposed continuing divisions in Britain\u2019s Labour party as rival factions offering contrasting interpretations of the results. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell is spinning the victory of the Liberal party as a boost for the kind of anti-austerity policies prompted by Labour\u2019s new leader Jeremy Corbyn. Fellow Corbynista Grahame Morris, the Labour MP for Easington, makes a similar point. But for one of Corbyn\u2019s opponents in the party, the MP John Mann, the real lesson from Canada for Labour is the collapse in the vote for the New Democrats under Thomas Mulcair. What Mann doesn\u2019t mention is that Trudeau was seen as outflanking Mulcair to the left during the campaign. One time leadership contender Chuka Umunna made a more subtle dig at Corbyn. The Liberal party has won a convincing majority, taking 184 seats. Canadians in every province voted for Liberal candidates, who won in striking victories in greater Toronto and Quebec. Justin Trudeau, son of arguably Canada\u2019s most famous politician, former prime minister Pierre Trudeau, follows his father into the role, having been touted as a future PM at the age of four months by Richard Nixon. After rousing his party from third in the polls to first place on voting day, Trudeau promised \u201csunny ways\u201d for all Canadians: This is what positive politics can do. This is what a positive, hopeful, a hopeful vision, and a platform and a team together can make happen. Canadians from all across this great country sent a clear message tonight, it\u2019s time for a change in this country, my friends, a real change. Outgoing prime minister Stephen Harper conceded the election after nearly 10 years in office, saying, \u201cthe people are never wrong\u201d. He will step down as leader of the Conservative party, which took 99 seats. The leftwing New Democratic Party (NDP) \u2013 previously the official opposition to Harper\u2019s government \u2013 suffered major losses, slumping to 44 seats. Leader Thomas Mulcair conceded to Trudeau and found solace in the humiliation of the Conservatives: Canadians have turned the page on 10 long years. They have rejected the politics of fear and division. The Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois has taken 10 seats, and the Green party, with one seat, is down from two before the dissolution. Green leader Elizabeth May was re-elected in the Saanich\u2013Gulf Islands. I\u2019m handing over this live blog now to my colleague Matthew Weaver. Thanks for reading. India\u2019s prime minister Narendra Modi has tweeted his congratulations to the new PM, saying he has \u201cfond memories\u201d of his visit to Canada in April: Aside from the three main parties, the smaller groupings have mostly failed to score any seats in the new parliament (you can see the full list here). Two that will be making an appearance in parliament are the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, which has taken 10 seats, and the Green party, with one seat, down from two before the dissolution. Green leader Elizabeth May was re-elected in the Saanich\u2013Gulf Islands. What of Stephen Harper, the Conservative prime minister now out of that role \u2013 and that of leader of his party \u2013 after close to a decade in the top job? Shortly before the election, my colleague Nick Davies put together this in-depth profile of a \u201cdeeply unpopular politician\u201d \u2013 who was nonetheless, at that point, still a contender to emerge from the election as prime minister: In the 11 years since he became leader of the country\u2019s Conservatives, the party has been fined for breaking electoral rules, and various members of Team Harper have been caught misleading parliament, gagging civil servants, subverting parliamentary committees, gagging scientists, harassing the supreme court, gagging diplomats, lying to the public, concealing evidence of potential crime, spying on opponents, bullying and smearing. Harper personally has earned himself the rare rebuke of being found to be in contempt of his parliament. One of his many biographers, John Ibbitson of the Globe and Mail newspaper, who is more sympathetic than most, concludes: \u201cNo prime minister in history and no political party have been loathed as intensely as Stephen Harper and the Conservative party.\u201d Yet this deeply unpopular politician has won three elections in the last nine years. Nick Clegg \u2013 remember him? \u2013 is cheered by the result in Canada: (For our non-UK readers, here\u2019s who Nick Clegg is.) \u201cSunny ways, my friends, sunny ways,\u201d is how Trudeau began his victory speech in Montreal, as he lauded what he called the power of \u201cpositive politics\u201d. He even directed a note of positivity towards the defeated Conservatives, telling Liberal supporters: Conservatives are not our enemies, they\u2019re our neighbours. But he did take a shot at some of Harper\u2019s more controversial policies: Canada was built by people from all corners of the world. We believe in our hearts that this country\u2019s unique diversity is a blessing bestowed upon us by previous generations of Canadians. Canadians who stared down prejudice and discrimination in all its forms. [Canadians] know in their heart of hearts that a Canadian is a Canadian is a Canadian. It\u2019s fair to say there hasn\u2019t yet been a flood of congratulations from other world leaders but it\u2019s early and they are starting to pop up now: this is from Italy\u2019s prime minister, Matteo Renzi: A short primer for readers new to this live blog: here are some of the priorities that Trudeau has set for his first weeks in power: Trudeau on climate change He has promised a climate change policy agreed with the provinces within 90 days of the UN climate change summit in Paris in November. On indigenous rights \u201cWe will build a renewed relationship with indigenous peoples on a nation-to-nation basis,\u201d he has said. \u201cThat will include, for example, a national public inquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women and girls. It will include $2.6bn over four years for First Nations education.\u201d On abortion He is pro-choice: \u201cIt is not for any government to legislate what a woman chooses to do with her body. And that is the bottom line.\u201d On taxes His first move will be to raise taxes on the richest 1% to fund cuts for the middle classes. On marijuana Trudeau has said he would start moves to legalise it \u201cright away\u201d, based on the Colorado model. On feminism John Barber, reporting from Toronto, says Trudeau\u2019s victory heralds the return of a sunnier Canada: The new Canadian leader\u2019s easiest job will be showing the world that Canada has returned to its traditional role of international boy scout, abjuring the hard-right, militaristic and climate-denying record of the Harper government. In that, he will be helped by the fact that the previous government \u2013 despite its own rhetoric and that of its enemies \u2013 never completely abandoned the role. Canadians and international observers can expect a sharp change in tone if not policy with respect to refugees and Canada\u2019s involvement in the Middle East. In his victory speech, Trudeau also took pains to disavow the previous government\u2019s attempts to win votes by inspiring fear of Muslim women who cover their faces. \u201cWe know thar our enviable, inclusive society didn\u2019t happen by accident, and won\u2019t continue without effort,\u201d he declared. But there are challenges ahead: The substance of the new leader\u2019s claims will quickly be tested on the international stage at next month\u2019s Paris climate summit, where a hastily assembled Canadian delegation will struggle to shake off the country\u2019s reputation as a laggard in the international fight against climate change. That may be more difficult than imagined, given Trudeau\u2019s consistent support for the Canadian oil industry, especially the notoriously dirty tar sands. Well, I say unlikely contender. As a four-month-old, Justin Trudeau was heralded as a future Canadian prime minister by then US president Richard Nixon. Which is an endorsement of sorts. As CBC News reports: \u201cTonight we\u2019ll dispense with the formalities. I\u2019d like to toast the future prime minister of Canada: to Justin Pierre Trudeau,\u201d Richard Nixon said at a gala buffet in April 1972 during a state visit to Ottawa when Trudeau was just four months old. According to a contemporary news wire report, Trudeau\u2019s father Pierre, then nearing the end of his first four-year Liberal mandate as prime minister, responded that should his eldest son \u2013 born on Christmas Day 1971 \u2013 ever become Canada\u2019s leader, \u201cI hope he has the grace and skill of the president.\u201d This is Justin Trudeau, on the left, being scooped up by his father, Pierre, who was returning from an overseas trip in 1983: How did Justin Trudeau pull off this victory? Just a few months ago, he was an unlikely contender to be Canada\u2019s next prime minister. Running third in the polls, behind the incumbent Conservatives and the resurgent leftwing New Democratic party, Trudeau \u2013 son of legendary prime minister Pierre Trudeau \u2013 was slated as too young (he is 43) and too inexperienced to haul his beleaguered Liberal party out of the electoral mess of the 2011 general election. What changed? Harper\u2019s tactics, referring to his challenger condescendingly as \u201cJustin\u201d and campaign ads that poked fun at his \u201cnice hair\u201d, found no grip among a section of the electorate that wanted the Conservatives out at all costs, and increasingly saw Trudeau as the best chance of achieving that. The long election campaign \u2013 the longest, in fact, since 1872, at 78 days \u2013 gave the Liberals the time to build on that boost. Trudeau told the Guardian in July that he relished it: \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing that recent history in Canada has shown it\u2019s that campaigns really matter. And there\u2019s a tremendous volatility among voters who are just looking for the right alternative.\u201d Welcome to our continuing live coverage of the Canadian general election, which has seen Justin Trudeau\u2019s Liberal party score a stunning victory over the Conservative government of Stephen Harper. Here\u2019s how the night panned out: The Liberal party has won a convincing majority, taking 184 seats. Canadians in every province voted for Liberal candidates, who won in striking victories in greater Toronto and Quebec. Justin Trudeau, son of arguably Canada\u2019s most famous politician, former prime minister Pierre Trudeau, follows his father into the role.

On pocketbook issues, they have pledged to slash taxes for the middle class while raising them for the wealthiest Canadians and rolling out an infrastructure plan that will put the country into three consecutive deficit budgets.

The Liberals have also committed to keeping Harper\u2019s controversial C-51 anti-terror legislation, though they have said they will implement a series of amendments including bringing in three-year sunset provisions on some of the most contentious parts of the bill. Also among his first tasks will be to assemble a cabinet, which he promised in campaigning would contain an equal number of men and women.

There were, perhaps, more talented and charismatic politicians among the Liberals and the NDP, but those parties were disorganized and unable to win majorities.

It was always a foregone conclusion that no one was going to miss Stephen Harper. He was never a leader in any meaningful sense of the word: he had no vision and no inspiring personal qualities. Canada settled for Harper because, for a long time, there was no one else realistic to settle for. There were, perhaps, more talented and charismatic politicians among the Liberals and the NDP, but those parties were disorganized and unable to win majorities. Canadians are a risk-averse people, so we stuck with the Conservatives and with Harper, who seemed like a calm, boring father. He was nothing special, but he could get the job done.

He said current laws were \u201cmaking marijuana too easy to access for our kids, and at the same time funding street crime, organised gangs and gun runners\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.liberal.ca/realchange/marijuana/\">The Liberal party\u2019s official position on cannabis states</a>: \u201cWe will legalise, regulate, and restrict access to marijuana. Canada\u2019s current system of marijuana prohibition does not work. It does not prevent young people from using marijuana and too many Canadians end up with criminal records for possessing small amounts of the drug.</p> <p>\u201cTo ensure that we keep marijuana out of the hands of children, and the profits out of the hands of criminals, we will legalise, regulate, and restrict access to marijuana.\u201d</p> <p>If Trudeau follows through on his pledge, Canada would become the first big country to fully legalise the cultivation, sale and recreational use of cannabis. The only country to have made cannabis fully legal is Uruguay, but the 2014 law has yet to be fully implemented. Other countries, like the Netherlands, Germany and Spain, have very relaxed enforcement on cannabis but its use is not fully legalised. </p>",

Bruce Linton, chief executive of Canopy Growth, which claims to provide to 20% of Canada\u2019s medical cannabis users, said: \u201cI think what you\u2019ll see perhaps, after this election \u2026 is a recognition that there is an opportunity to collect taxes on something that is already being sold into the market illegally or illicitly.\u201d Shares in the other big players in Canada\u2019s cannabis industry Aphria Inc and Mettrum Health rose by 8.4% and 7.1%, respectively. Some other smaller weed companies\u2019 shares rose by as much as 40%. Aaron Salz, an analyst at Dundee Capital Markets, said: \u201cTrudeau\u2019s vow to legalise and regulate marijuana the \u2018right way\u2019 has set in motion the single most important catalyst for the marijuana space.\u201d Legalising cannabis had been a key plank of Trudeau\u2019s campaign and he had promised to work towards legalising it \u201cright away\u201d. \u201cWe don\u2019t yet know exactly what rate we\u2019re going to be taxing it, how we\u2019re going to control it, or whether it will happen in the first months, within the first year, or whether it\u2019s going to take a year or two to kick in,\u201d he said in the run-up to Monday night\u2019s vote. Trudeau said legalising and regulating cannabis \u2013 in a similar way to how it is controlled in Colorado, Washington, Oregon, Alaska and DC \u2013 would actually make it easier to prevent children from accessing the drug and give tax revenues a big boost. He said current laws were \u201cmaking marijuana too easy to access for our kids, and at the same time funding street crime, organised gangs and gun runners\u201d. The Liberal party\u2019s official position on cannabis states: \u201cWe will legalise, regulate, and restrict access to marijuana. Canada\u2019s current system of marijuana prohibition does not work. It does not prevent young people from using marijuana and too many Canadians end up with criminal records for possessing small amounts of the drug. \u201cTo ensure that we keep marijuana out of the hands of children, and the profits out of the hands of criminals, we will legalise, regulate, and restrict access to marijuana.\u201d If Trudeau follows through on his pledge, Canada would become the first big country to fully legalise the cultivation, sale and recreational use of cannabis. The only country to have made cannabis fully legal is Uruguay, but the 2014 law has yet to be fully implemented. Other countries, like the Netherlands, Germany and Spain, have very relaxed enforcement on cannabis but its use is not fully legalised.",

The party started this election campaign, Canada\u2019s longest since 1872, in third place in the polls behind both Stephen Harper\u2019s Conservatives and the New Democratic Party (NDP) of Tom Mulcair. On Monday, prime minister-designate Justin Trudeau\u2019s party won 184 seats with 39.5% of the vote. The result was the greatest political comeback in Canadian history. Here are three maps that show the scale of how Canada\u2019s political landscape has changed so dramatically since the previous election in 2011. The Liberals increased their vote share by more than 15 percentage points in every single one of Canada\u2019s 13 provinces and territories. Gains in Ontario and Quebec in particular were crucial in pushing the party over the 170-seats line needed to win a majority. The Conservatives of outgoing prime minister Harper lost votes everywhere except in Quebec, where its share remained fundamentally unchanged. In Ontario, where the Tories made key gains in 2011, the party lost nearly 9.5 points. The NDP, leading in the polls when the campaign kicked off some 80 days ago, ended the night a distant third. In Quebec, which was crucial in propelling the NDP into second spot nationally just four years ago, the party\u2019s vote share receded by 17.5 percentage points to 25%.

          "bodyText": "Justin Trudeau has begun his first full day as Canada\u2019s prime minister-designate after a dramatic federal election that ended the divisive reign of the Conservative Stephen Harper. The son of former prime minister Pierre Trudeau and leader of the Liberal party won a surprise majority, taking 184 of the 338 seats in parliament with representatives in every province and roughly 40% of the popular vote. After rousing his party from third in the polls to first place on voting day, Trudeau promised \u201csunny ways\u201d for all Canadians. \u201cThis is what positive politics can do. This is what a positive, hopeful vision, and a platform and a team together can make happen,\u201d he said in his victory speech. Among his first tasks will be to assemble a cabinet, which he promised in campaigning would contain an equal number of men and women. Trudeau is expected to be sworn in before the G20 summit in Turkey, which starts on 15 November. His victory speech omitted any mention of his flamboyant father who led Canada from 1968 to 1984, with one brief interruption. \u201cIn Canada better is always possible,\u201d a hoarse but jubilant Trudeau told cheering supporters at Liberal headquarters in Montreal\u2019s Queen Elizabeth hotel. \u201cCanadians from all across this great country sent a clear message tonight, it\u2019s time for a change in this country, my friends, a real change.\u201d Switching between French and English, Trudeau held out an olive branch to his defeated rivals after a vicious and divisive campaign. \u201cAs I\u2019ve said many times over the course of this campaign, conservatives are not our enemies, they\u2019re our neighbors,\u201d he said. In an implicit rebuke to Harper \u2013 who had attempted to exploit a row over Muslim women\u2019s right to cover their face \u2013 he said: \u201cWe know in our bones that Canada was built by people from all corners of the world, who worship every faith, who belong to every culture, who speak every language.\u201d The election was seen in part as a referendum on the leadership of Harper and his neo-liberal economics and hawkish foreign policy. Opinion polls before the vote had pointed to a hung parliament, but in the event the election resulted in a resounding defeat for Harper. His Conservative party fell from 166 seats to about 101 as a red wave swept out Tory incumbents across the country. The Conservatives announced they would be seeking an interim leader in the coming days. In his concession speech before a despondent audience in Calgary, Harper did not mention his resignation, instead focusing on thanking his supporters. \u201cWe put it all on the line, we gave everything we have to give, and we have no regrets whatsoever,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cThe disappointment you feel is my responsibility and mine alone.\u201d Conservative casualties of the night included a string of high-profile former cabinet ministers, including the immigration minister, Chris Alexander, and Joe Oliver, who became the first finance minister to lose his seat in an election for more than 20 years. The seats were representative of a Liberal sweep of the Greater Toronto area, the populous and vote-rich area around Canada\u2019s largest city, where the Conservatives made dramatic gains in 2011. Peter MacKay, a former senior Conservative cabinet minister, described the result as a \u201csea change\u201d. \u201cWe are used to high tides in Atlantic Canada.

But they focused on an upbeat message under the tagline \u201cReal Change\u201d and offered bold policy promises, including a pledge to run three consecutive deficits in order to fund infrastructure spending.

The party\u2019s election promises include ending Canada\u2019s combat mission as part of the US-led coalition against Isis in Iraq and Syria and refocusing military efforts on training local forces and humanitarian efforts. Trudeau has also committed to bringing in 25,000 Syrian refugees to Canada and investing $250m into refugee processing. He has committed to pulling Canada out of the new F-35 stealth fighter jet program, a 12-country partnership that includes the US, UK and Australia. The Liberals have also committed to launching a national inquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women \u2013 something Harper repeatedly refused to do \u2013 amending the Conservative\u2019s controversial anti-terrorism bill and legalizing marijuana in Canada.",

Thank you all for lovely company throughout today. Mike and I will be back shaking our tail feathers bright and early tomorrow morning.</p> <p>Let\u2019s review Tuesday.</p> <ul> <li>The government will, in response to <strong>David Murray\u2019s</strong> review of the financial services sector, implement further competition in the superannuation industry and will also attempt to contain credit card surcharges to the cost of actually providing the service. Labor may or may not help with this exercise, although both sides are talking the talk on the enduring virtue of bipartisanship.<br></li> <li>The immigration minister <strong>Peter Dutton</strong> thinks we don\u2019t need additional oversight of immigration detention facilities despite the wealth of field evidence suggesting additional oversight would be a very good thing. It\u2019s all fine, Dutton told reporters today, because a journalist is currently on Nauru, having a look about. That journalist is The Australian\u2019s <strong>Chris Kenny</strong>.<br></li> <li>Labor had a sharper day in question time today, succeeding in a couple of questions in stranding the prime minister between the prime minister he would be, left to his own devices, and the prime minister he must be in order to ensure conservatives remain more or less in the Coalition tent. Turnbull struggled to find coherence in a couple of answers to climate change questions.<br></li> <li>The government has signalled a plan to overhaul question time in order to allow constituency questions from their own backbenchers. This sounds to me like it could be a very good thing. Labor is churlish about it, suspecting a secret plan to wind back accountability during the hour of glower. This churlishness would make sense if there actually was genuine accountability during the hour of glower. I suspect some hypothetical mourning is in play.<br></li> <li>Oh yes, and Canada got a new government. <strong>Tony Abbott\u2019s</strong> soul brother <strong>Stephen Harper</strong> is out the back door after what sounded like a deeply grubby campaign. <strong>Justin Trudeau </strong>from the Liberals (Canada\u2019s equivalent of the ALP)<strong> </strong>is set to take the prime ministership.</li> </ul> <p>There was more, but that\u2019s the main bits.</p> <p>Have a lovely evening. Let\u2019s regroup in the morning times.<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5625e083e4b0c066531ace79\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-10-20T06:37:01.066Z\">7.37am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Sometimes it is very hard not to lose it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/workmanalice/statuses/656345879683530752\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I can&#39;t get enough of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JoshFrydenberg\">@JoshFrydenberg</a> laughing during <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/qt?src=hash\">#qt</a> today. <a href=\"https://t.co/UBsEncigyQ\">pic.twitter.com/UBsEncigyQ</a></p>&mdash; Alice Workman (@workmanalice) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/workmanalice/status/656345879683530752\">October 20, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5625deb6e4b0c19d83256d63\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-10-20T06:33:26.550Z\">7.33am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Just in case we missed <strong>Bob Katter\u2019s</strong> theatrical exit from the chamber during question time, the Queensland MP has issued a statement.</p> <p>The statement reads: \u201cAfter walking out of question time in disgust, Mr Katter said that the minister\u2019s reply was the usual lecture on \u2018Paul Keating Liberal Party Market Fundamentalism\u2019.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Bob Katter:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It showed not the slightest interest in every person who is striving to create export markets in northern Australia. If there is one choke on northern development, it is that all products north of the trading ports of Townsville and Port Hedland have to go through Darwin. But who would develop any project knowing that it has to go through a turnpike called the Port of Darwin? It\u2019s not a port - it\u2019s a money collector for a Chinese corporation. There are massive phosphate, iron ore and copper reserves in northern Australia, but who\u2019s going to develop them in the knowledge they can be skinned alive with port charges? And what is the point in the government putting $700m into a railway line that goes direct to a foreign-owned monopolistic port? Every single development will now pay a toll \u2013 a discretionary toll of whatever level the Chinese owner feels like setting. You\u2019d have to be mad to build a business that would export product anywhere in northern Australia under those conditions.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Katter statement also makes it clear he didn\u2019t like ministers erupting in laughter at his antics.</p> <p>The minister for northern Australia, <strong>Josh Frydenberg</strong>, completely lost it.</p> <p>ICYMI, Mike captured Katter on his way out the door.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2369871bf9e3564d1ab5100a0b790d1df7997734\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2369871bf9e3564d1ab5100a0b790d1df7997734/0_0_4500_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bob Katter\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The member for Kennedy, Bob Katter, storms out before his question is answered during question time in the House of Representatives on Tuesday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-10-20T06:42:23.324Z\">at 7.42am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5625d6d5e4b0c19d83256d4d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-10-20T06:06:18.071Z\">7.06am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"http://www.essentialvision.com.au/category/essentialreport\">Another new opinion poll this afternoon</a> \u2013 Essential. Unlike the Ipsos poll earlier this week, which put the Coalition with a commanding lead, Essential\u2019s two-party-preferred number is Coalition 51%, Labor 49%. This data in this particular poll is based on two-week averages, so we\u2019d expect it to be slower to record a surge by either party, but today\u2019s figure is more in line with last week\u2019s Newspoll, which had the major parties in a dead heat at 50-50. Anyway, there\u2019s little point in second-guessing anything much at this point, there\u2019s nothing to do but wait and see how the trend plays out for Turnbull in the coming weeks and months.</p> <p>A couple of interesting questions.</p> <p><em>Q. Do you approve or disapprove of the way the prime minister Malcolm Turnbull is handling the threat of terrorism in Australia?</em></p> <ul> <li>56% approve of the way the Turnbull is handling the threat of terrorism in Australia and 17% disapprove.<br></li> <li>73% of Liberal/National voters and 50% of Labor voters approve.<br></li> <li><strong>Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s</strong> approval rating is considerably higher than <strong>Tony Abbott\u2019s </strong>rating for handling the threat of terrorism as measured in March.</li> </ul> <p>(Who\u2019d have thunk it, eh? Turn down the volume to a reasonable level, look to approach the national security issue constructively and inclusively, and voters have more confidence in the strategy.)</p> <p><em>Q. Under new national security laws phone and internet records of all Australians will be held for two years. How much trust do you have in the following organisations to store your personal data safely and in a way that would prevent abuse?</em></p> <ul> <li>49% have a lot or some trust in security agencies to store personal data safely and in a way that would prevent abuse \u2013 although only 16% have a lot of trust.<br></li> <li>A majority have little or no trust in the government (55%), telecommunications companies and internet service providers (64%) and other private companies (73%) to safely store personal data.<br></li> <li>Overall, trust has declined a little since this question was asked last year.<br></li> </ul> <p><em>Q.

If the government chooses to seek bipartisan agreement around a superannuation objective, we would engage in that process and see if it is possible.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Jim Chalmers</strong>, shadow minister for financial services and superannuation.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is lots of common ground as Chris was saying in his introduction, but there are a couple of areas where there is not yet unanimous agreement as well. I think superannuation is one of those areas where the government\u2019s approach is not the same as the opposition\u2019s approach.</p> <p>Again, the superannuation sector is crucial to the health of our economy. There\u2019s more than $2 trillion under management, that\u2019s 10% bigger this year than the year before. There\u2019s a lot at stake when it comes to superannuation.</p> <p>Super is the hope of the side when it comes to boosting living standards in this country, taking pressure off the pension and creating those deeper pools of capital in our economy as well.</p> <p>It is pleasing to see as Chris said they\u2019re up for a conversation about enshrining the purpose of superannuation in our economic arrangements, because from that then flows a series of other decisions about adequacy and tax concessions and all kinds of important issues in the superannuation system.</p> <p>Beyond that agreement over enshrining the objective of super, there are some areas of disagreement, not just in this report but more broadly.</p> </blockquote> <p>Bottom line?

Looking like you\u2019ll do something on credit card surcharges is appropriately punter friendly. Trying to dilute the power of the industry super funds by promoting more competition is a long-held ideological fixation for the Liberal party.</p> <p>I\u2019m actually interested in a side point to today\u2019s proceedings. We know that <strong>Malcolm Turnbull </strong>has to preset reset on the concept of economic reform and on the government\u2019s economic/managerial competence given the disruption of the Abbott period. The new prime minister took the opportunity of today to practice some new narrative concepts in this space.</p> <p>In launching the Murray response, Turnbull harked back to the Howard and Costello era \u2013 a period that many Australian voters will associated with settled governance and with economic prosperity. The new prime minister drew a line from that period to the present, skipping over the turbulent Abbott period almost entirely.</p> <p>While history was being refashioned before our eyes, Turnbull also noted in passing the Howard/Costello prudential regulations had saved Australia from the impact of the global financial crisis. Labor\u2019s period in office, the economic stimulus provided by the then Rudd government during the GFC, a bit like the Abbott period, was omitted from Turnbull\u2019s official record. Pfft to all that.</p> <p>Given Turnbull is in the business of drawing lines, I\u2019ll draw another one. Yesterday in Question Time, Turnbull resumed his old arguments against the Rudd/Swan stimulus package during the GFC. Turnbull said yesterday we are in debt now because Labor spent waaayyy too much during the GFC, not (of course) because <strong>Tony Abbott</strong> couldn\u2019t get the budget strategy back on track during his two years in the prime ministerial suite, failing to manage the complex shifts going on in the global economy and the domestic scene.</p> <p>It\u2019s pretty obvious that Turnbull is working out where to position himself in one of his key jobs: selling the government\u2019s economic story. Today we got some pretty significant clues.</p> <p>Let the new record show that <strong>Malcolm Turnbull </strong>got it right when he opposed Labor\u2019s second stimulus package (remember that?). Let it show that Labor completely botched everything including the management of the financial crisis. Let it show the Turnbull/Morrison ticket is like a reborn <strong>John Howard</strong> and <strong>Peter Costello</strong>. Competent, considered. Fond of steady power walking and (in Costello\u2019s case) occasional outbreaks of passive aggression.</p> <p>Do please forget about <strong>Tony Abbott</strong> and <strong>Joe Hockey.</strong></p> <p>While you are at it, please forget Labor\u2019s strongest claim to economic credibility \u2013 the argument that policy quick action by <strong>Kevin Rudd</strong> and <strong>Wayne Swan</strong> kept Australia out of recession.</p> <p>So yesterday, all that.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-562573bae4b0c066531acddd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-10-19T22:58:38.868Z\">11.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>I gather from <strong>Daniel Hurst</strong> that the government response to Murray did not reference negative gearing (which he raised as a problem), or super tax concessions.

There\u2019s no law that says you\u2019ve got to charge so much for a hotel room or an airline flight, whatever. But if you go out there and you say there is a 2 or 3% surcharge for using a credit card, for example, that carries with it, I think we would all agree, a very clear representation, which I don\u2019t think can be disclaimed, a very clear representation that the merchant is recovering the costs of you, the customer, using a card as opposed to paying in cash.</p> <p>And now, the fact is that we all know, it\u2019s very widely known, that in some cases, in many cases, these surcharges are well in excess of the real cost and so it is \u2013 this is just a matter of ensuring that the representation that merchants make is by virtue of regulation an accurate one.</p> </blockquote> <p>The treasurer keeps it simpler.

As we go live this morning a number of my colleagues are locked up downstairs in a briefing about the Murray inquiry.</p> <p>The government intends to respond today to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2014/dec/07/australian-banks-should-increase-capital-reserves-financial-services-inquiry-finds\">recommendations delivered last year</a> by former banker and Future Fund supremo, <strong>David Murray. </strong>Murray was tasked by <strong>Tony Abbott</strong> and <strong>Joe Hockey</strong> to look at Australia\u2019s banking sector and advise the government how to make improvements to strengthen financial resilience and to boost competition.</p> <p>He recommended the banks increase their current capital ratios to ensure they were in a position to absorb future financial shocks \u2013 a move the banks say will increase costs to shareholders or customers. In addition to recommendations about better regulation of financial advisers, and lowering bank interchange fees, Murray also recommended a number of tax reform measures, criticising generous housing and superannuation concessions. It will be interesting to see how the government responds.</p> <p>My colleague <strong>Daniel Hurst</strong> is in the briefing and we expect to have particulars shortly after 9am.</p> <p>To non-Murray matters, the news cycle this morning is following through the major issues from yesterday. After a day in estimates going over the details of <strong>Tony Abbott\u2019s</strong> (alleged) boozy farewell in the cabinet suite which resulted in the destruction of a bespoke marble topped table (yes, the Incredible Hulk is rumoured to have made an appearance) \u2013 the former prime minister has now agreed to pick up the tab.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/oct/20/tony-abbott-says-he-will-pay-for-table-damaged-during-his-farewell-party\">statement issued last night</a>, Abbott said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On the night of the leadership change I hosted drinks in the cabinet anteroom for staff and colleagues. During this event a coffee table was damaged. I have asked my office to have the Department of Parliamentary Services invoice me for the value of the table. It was my event so I take responsibility for it.</p> </blockquote> <p>Abbott has not, thus far at least, indicated that he\u2019ll pick up the tab for the booze. Officials confirmed last night tired and emotional guests were served beverages from the official alcohol stash.</p> <p>I\u2019ll get to Four Corners in the next post (I don\u2019t know about you but I\u2019m still recovering) but another significant thing to bookmark is a call by the Human Rights Commission president <strong>Gillian Triggs</strong> for greater oversight of immigration detention centres.</p> <p>In an <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-10-19/case-of-somali-woman-allegedly-raped-on-nauru-extraordinary/6865890\">interview</a> last night on the Lateline program, Triggs has criticised the treatment of the Somali refugee who was allegedly raped and impregnated on Nauru. The woman was then brought to Australia for a termination before being dispatched quickly back to Nauru without the termination. Refugee advocates and immigration minister <strong>Peter Dutton</strong> have been jousting over the specific details of the case for several days.</p> <p><strong>Gillian Triggs:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A young woman, 23 years old, obviously very distressed from the facts to the extent that one can glean them, a woman who really needs counselling and a safe environment. It\u2019s extraordinary that she was expected to reach a decision in such a short space of time and when the answer wasn\u2019t given immediately she\u2019s literally air lifted back to Nauru.</p> <p>It makes a much broader point that the lack of transparency, the secrecy with which we conduct these detention centres and what goes on in them and of course in our own detention centres in Australia, that is really a core problem and why we really need some form of independent monitoring.</p> </blockquote> <p>That we do. We really, really do. Perhaps the government could use its renewed interest in human rights (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/oct/19/julie-bishop-lauds-strong-human-rights-institutions-after-abbotts-attacks\">we heard something of this from the foreign minister and the attorney-general yesterday</a>) to deliver on that modest imperative. There\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/oct/19/afghan-asylum-seeker-feared-dead-after-self-immolation-during-video-call\">another terrible story</a> around this morning: an Afghan asylum seeker living in Australia on a bridging visa is feared dead after he self-immolated during a video call with refugee advocates.</p> <p>It\u2019s time to open today\u2019s Politics Live conversation.

          "bodyText": "Right, that\u2019s enough for a Tuesday. Thank you all for lovely company throughout today. Mike and I will be back shaking our tail feathers bright and early tomorrow morning. Let\u2019s review Tuesday. The government will, in response to David Murray\u2019s review of the financial services sector, implement further competition in the superannuation industry and will also attempt to contain credit card surcharges to the cost of actually providing the service. Labor may or may not help with this exercise, although both sides are talking the talk on the enduring virtue of bipartisanship. The immigration minister Peter Dutton thinks we don\u2019t need additional oversight of immigration detention facilities despite the wealth of field evidence suggesting additional oversight would be a very good thing. It\u2019s all fine, Dutton told reporters today, because a journalist is currently on Nauru, having a look about. That journalist is The Australian\u2019s Chris Kenny. Labor had a sharper day in question time today, succeeding in a couple of questions in stranding the prime minister between the prime minister he would be, left to his own devices, and the prime minister he must be in order to ensure conservatives remain more or less in the Coalition tent. Turnbull struggled to find coherence in a couple of answers to climate change questions. The government has signalled a plan to overhaul question time in order to allow constituency questions from their own backbenchers. This sounds to me like it could be a very good thing. Labor is churlish about it, suspecting a secret plan to wind back accountability during the hour of glower. This churlishness would make sense if there actually was genuine accountability during the hour of glower. I suspect some hypothetical mourning is in play. Oh yes, and Canada got a new government. Tony Abbott\u2019s soul brother Stephen Harper is out the back door after what sounded like a deeply grubby campaign. Justin Trudeau from the Liberals (Canada\u2019s equivalent of the ALP) is set to take the prime ministership. There was more, but that\u2019s the main bits. Have a lovely evening. Let\u2019s regroup in the morning times. Sometimes it is very hard not to lose it. Just in case we missed Bob Katter\u2019s theatrical exit from the chamber during question time, the Queensland MP has issued a statement. The statement reads: \u201cAfter walking out of question time in disgust, Mr Katter said that the minister\u2019s reply was the usual lecture on \u2018Paul Keating Liberal Party Market Fundamentalism\u2019.\u201d Bob Katter: It showed not the slightest interest in every person who is striving to create export markets in northern Australia. If there is one choke on northern development, it is that all products north of the trading ports of Townsville and Port Hedland have to go through Darwin. But who would develop any project knowing that it has to go through a turnpike called the Port of Darwin? It\u2019s not a port - it\u2019s a money collector for a Chinese corporation. There are massive phosphate, iron ore and copper reserves in northern Australia, but who\u2019s going to develop them in the knowledge they can be skinned alive with port charges? And what is the point in the government putting $700m into a railway line that goes direct to a foreign-owned monopolistic port? Every single development will now pay a toll \u2013 a discretionary toll of whatever level the Chinese owner feels like setting. You\u2019d have to be mad to build a business that would export product anywhere in northern Australia under those conditions. The Katter statement also makes it clear he didn\u2019t like ministers erupting in laughter at his antics. The minister for northern Australia, Josh Frydenberg, completely lost it. ICYMI, Mike captured Katter on his way out the door. Another new opinion poll this afternoon \u2013 Essential. Unlike the Ipsos poll earlier this week, which put the Coalition with a commanding lead, Essential\u2019s two-party-preferred number is Coalition 51%, Labor 49%. This data in this particular poll is based on two-week averages, so we\u2019d expect it to be slower to record a surge by either party, but today\u2019s figure is more in line with last week\u2019s Newspoll, which had the major parties in a dead heat at 50-50. Anyway, there\u2019s little point in second-guessing anything much at this point, there\u2019s nothing to do but wait and see how the trend plays out for Turnbull in the coming weeks and months. A couple of interesting questions. Q. Do you approve or disapprove of the way the prime minister Malcolm Turnbull is handling the threat of terrorism in Australia? 56% approve of the way the Turnbull is handling the threat of terrorism in Australia and 17% disapprove. 73% of Liberal/National voters and 50% of Labor voters approve. Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s approval rating is considerably higher than Tony Abbott\u2019s rating for handling the threat of terrorism as measured in March. (Who\u2019d have thunk it, eh? Turn down the volume to a reasonable level, look to approach the national security issue constructively and inclusively, and voters have more confidence in the strategy.) Q. Under new national security laws phone and internet records of all Australians will be held for two years. How much trust do you have in the following organisations to store your personal data safely and in a way that would prevent abuse? 49% have a lot or some trust in security agencies to store personal data safely and in a way that would prevent abuse \u2013 although only 16% have a lot of trust. A majority have little or no trust in the government (55%), telecommunications companies and internet service providers (64%) and other private companies (73%) to safely store personal data. Overall, trust has declined a little since this question was asked last year. Q. Which of the following statements is closest to your view? Governments having access to personal telephone and internet information is necessary to protect society from terrorist or criminal actions. Governments are increasingly using the argument about terrorism to collect and store personal data and information, and this is a dangerous direction for society Don\u2019t know. Opinions were divided between the two statements. 42% agreed more that \u201cgovernments having access to personal telephone and internet information is necessary to protect society from terrorist or criminal actions\u201d and 41% agreed more that \u201cgovernments are increasingly using the argument about terrorism to collect and store personal data and information, and this is a dangerous direction for society\u201d Since this question was asked in 2014 there has been a consistent shift to agreement that \u201cgovernments having access to personal telephone and internet information is necessary to protect society from terrorist or criminal actions\u201d. A couple more Bowers pictures that I have not yet had time to use. Health minister Sussan Ley, working on her bone density. And Nick Xenophon doing what he does better than most occupants of this building: getting on the TV news. He is a grab-dropping genius. Back to the Murray response. It\u2019s treasurer Scott Morrison\u2019s turn in the Sky studio. Q: Will interest rates go up as a consequence of the new bank capitalisation requirements? Morrison: That\u2019s a commercial decision for the banks at the end of the day. Morrison says big banks to tend to pass on increased costs to their customers, unlike small businesses, which absorb increases in their operating costs. Q: Do they have a reason to blame you for this? No they don\u2019t. We are on credit card surcharges now. Morrison makes a big call. We are banning profiteering on these fees. Sorry. Not really, no. This is from today\u2019s statement on the Murray response. We will legislate to ban merchants from imposing unfair card surcharges that are greater than the cost to them of accepting payment by card. The government will work with stakeholders on the legislative response and phasing of the implementation. We will make the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission responsible for enforcing these surcharging regulations, to ensure consumers are treated fairly and not overcharged when they pay using a card. We also endorse the payments system board\u2019s ongoing review of interchange fees. \u201cBanning profiteering\u201d isn\u2019t this. Manager of opposition business Tony Burke has issued a statement about the proposed changes to question time procedure \u2013 the government\u2019s plan to turn over more questions to the backbench on constituency matters. Tony Burke: This is just more talk from Malcolm Turnbull. Government MPs can already ask ministers questions about their electorates both in question time and in writing. While the detail around today\u2019s announcement is scant, it appears all it will do is change how the government plans to ask questions to itself. If this results in fewer theatrical performances from ministers reading scripted attacks, noone would objet to this. This is just a change to the government\u2019s tactics, not a change to any rules. If the government decides to take one step further and change the standing orders to dictate questions the opposition can ask, this would be fiercely resisted. We must not see a decrease in transparency and Labor will be following this closely. Powering forth, the architect of the Murray report, David Murray, is being interviewed by Sky News on the events of the day. Murray is asked whether the banks have any excuse to put up interest rates in the wake of the new capital ratio requirements. He steps quite carefully around that question, avoiding a straight answer. Murray is asked how the government can actually bring down credit card surcharges. He says charging a surcharge above cost is not appropriate, but as to the specifics \u2013 That\u2019s up to the payments system board to enforce. How easy will it be to introduce more competition in the superannuation sector? Murray says default funds have been opened up elsewhere and when that happens there\u2019s a decrease in costs. Malsplaining\u2122, a sequence. Just a slight delay in picture transmission today. My system has had some gremlins. Before we side stroke on, here\u2019s a selection of Mike Bowers fabulousness from the chamber today. Further questions have been placed on the notice paper. I\u2019ll survey the world outside the chamber briefly and be back to deliver Tuesday afternoon. Cheer up Joe, today is either your last or second-last question time. Kevin Andrews is not decamping, but he has John Howard\u2019s Chesterfield. Bowen is back to the dispatch box. Q: Can the treasurer confirm that next financial year, gross debt is forecast is to be $100bn higher than when the Liberal government was elected? A short barrage of numbers from Morrison followed by the nub point: it\u2019s higher. Then, the treasurer says, it will fall. I will tell you why it will fall. The reason it will fall is because this government has a program to ensure we get control of expenditure and expenditure as a percentage of GDP will decline over the forward estimates because we have a plan to control expenditure. What goes up, must come .. Shadow treasurer Chris Bowen, to treasurer Scott Morrison. Q: My question is to the treasurer. When does the prime minister project the budget will return to surplus? Scott Morrison: When expenditure is less than revenue. (Pay that.) A fair dose of the Malsplain in this particular session. Delightful in its expansive fashion. A person, talking in sentences. Like a nice breeze. But might wear just a teensy bit thin. Labor has moved to marriage equality. Q: Given the prime minister has said he doesn\u2019t want marriage equality to be a live issue all the way up to the next election, will the prime minister allow a free vote on the co sponsored private member\u2019s bill currently before the parliament? Turnbull thinks he might take a trip down memory lane. Where were you in 1999 Terri Butler? I was leading the republican debate. On the marriage equality plebiscite. Yes, it will take more time. Yes, it will cost more money. Yes, in my view it will be carried \u2013 but time will tell. Turnbull is asked about his disposition towards a bill in the senate which revisits the debate indulged by the Abbott government about changes to hate speech. The debate around changes to the Racial Discrimination Act is a reasonable one, but that bill isn\u2019t going anywhere, the prime minister says. There is a bill in the senate, it has not been considered by the government. I can say that the government does not have any plans to reopen this matter. I imagine it will be a matter of lively discussion in the future. This was considered some time ago but it is ... I think it\u2019s very important for debates of this kind to be undertaken at the right time and place and in the right context. We have to bear in mind, and the honourable member would well understand this I\u2019ve got no doubt. We have to bear in mind that we have in our society, as in all free societies, to balance the demands of free speech, which we are all in favour, with also ensuring domestic harmony. It is an important debate in a free society that we should have about the limits of speech and the way in which we can best ensure that we preserve social harmony \u2013 that we preserve security and at the same time ensure that there is free speech. Labor now inquiries why the government is backing off its proposed changes to family tax benefits. Turnbull tells the opposition you can\u2019t have this both ways: attack the proposal and then attack the backdown. The prime minister. Instead of actually welcoming (the shift), she (shadow families minister Jenny Macklin) stands up in the parliament and wants to attack the government. Speaking of northern Australia, independent MP Bob Katter has an incomprehensible question for Josh Frydenberg, the minister for norther Australia. Apparently Katter doesn\u2019t care for Frydenberg\u2019s answer. He departs the chamber. Frydenberg loses it, laughing. The chamber joins him. Labor, persisting. Q: My question is to the prime minister. Does the prime minister agree that the clean energy finance corporation established by Labor has successfully driven investments in clean energy technology and is helping to cut emissions intensity in our economy? Does the prime minister accept that the Clean Energy Finance Corporation has a crucial role to play in Australia\u2019s efforts to tackle climate change? Turnbull says it is the government\u2019s policy to scrap the CEFC. Thus far, the parliament has not allowed that to happen. The prime minister: It is a fair question ... to ask whether it is necessary as an institution and indeed it was the government\u2019s policy to abolish it because we do not support \u2013 we do not support government banks. (Well, apart the investment fund for northern Australia, set up by the government, which looks a whole lot like the CEFC. Turnbull is astride the barbed wire fence on this question.) Turnbull says the CEFC is playing a part in reducing emissions. It plays a part. It is certainly making a contribution. But the reduction of emissions across the board is contributed to by many things. The treasurer Scott Morrison is up now on the Murray response. He doesn\u2019t think people should be shackled by superannuation deals. Deals of the Labor sort. Labor is sticking with climate. Q: The prime minister stated earlier in question time today that the only thing that matters in climate change policy is is it going to cut emissions. In March, the department of environment found that by 2020 emissions will be 20% higher than they were at the time this Liberal government was elected. So why is the PM sticking with the discredited direct action policy? The prime minister rejects the premise of the question, and says the environment minister Greg Hunt will provide particulars. There is some laughter, but Hunt sails to the dispatch box. The department of the environment recently released figures which showed that Australia\u2019s latest quarterly emissions were the lowest since 2004, not just in trend but also in seasonal terms. So, let me repeat that \u2013 the lowest emissions since 2004 in both trend and seasonal terms. Labor\u2019s Mark Butler seeks to table the departmental material. He\u2019s waved away. Labor opens on the theme of Malcolm Turnbull talking big but delivering little. Q: The prime minister stated in 2009 \u2018I will not lead a party that is not as committed to effective action on climate change as I am.\u2019 But this week it\u2019s been confirmed that not one company will be required to reduce its pollution levels under the Liberals\u2019 direct action plan. Why is the prime minister sticking with such an ineffectively policy to tackle climate change? Malcolm Turnbull says Labor has one objection. Now, what the honourable member objects to is that the government does not have as one of its measures an emissions trading scheme. And that is true. We do not. It was repealed. It used to be Coalition policy. It is not anymore. But the point is, as I have said many times in the past, and am happy to say again, an emissions trading scheme is no more than one mechanicism to reduce emissions. It is a means to an ends, not the solution. Now, the fact is that emissions trading schemes have worked better in theory than in practice in the - over the last six or seven years. That is undoubtedly correct. The mechanisms we have in place which the environment minister has carefully assembled and carefully explained in this chamber will result in Australia meeting the commitments we are taking to Paris \u2013 a 26 to 28% cut in emissions. We will meet those targets, we will meet them with the measures we have. We will review our measures in 2017 and, if they need adjustment, then we will adjust them. But our commitment to those targets is absolute and honourable members opposite should get used to the fact that we are committed to cutting emissions. It being 2pm .. The prime minister on indulgence makes a statement about the government\u2019s proposed changes to question time. Malcolm Turnbull: Honourable members will understand that the object of question time should be to ensure that local members \u2013 members \u2013 are able to raise matters of concern to their local electorates. Turnbull notes if Labor members don\u2019t approve they can continue to do whatever they like, they can continue asking questions written for them by the leader of the opposition\u2019s staff, they can continue doing that. It is entirely up to the opposition whether they want to give their backbenchers a say or not. Labor quite grumpy down there. Question time is closing in at great speed so just a quick summary today. Politics, this Tuesday lunchtime. The government has released its response to the Murray review of the financial system. The government says it will crack down on excessive surcharges for credit card transactions and will introduce more choice and competition in superannuation. Labor has signalled it could accept some but not all of the recommendations. Estimates is bubbling along. The SBS chief has been given a clip around the ears by an LNP senator about campaigning in favour of marriage equality (a critique which appeared to relate to SBS\u2019s support for a corporate anti-discrimination initiative), and the Human Rights Commission president Gillian Triggs has enjoyed an outbreak of peace love and harmony during her appearance today, in stark contrast to her last appearance. Human rights: so hot right now. Rapprochement only goes so far. Immigration minister Peter Dutton doesn\u2019t see the need for enhanced accountability and oversight in immigration detention centres \u2013 today rebuffing a fresh call by Triggs for a clearer sightline into the facilities. Triggs\u2019 call for greater oversight on Monday night followed the case of the Somali woman allegedly raped and impregnated on Nauru, and the bitterly contested facts around her subsequent treatment. Human rights. Not so hot right now. The government has signalled an overhaul of question time to allow more constituency questions. It sounds like a really good idea, but like anything, only time will tell. Don\u2019t leave your chair. Much more to come. A big deal, that Canadian result. Obviously sent Kevin Rudd into a flat swoon. Someone send the smelling salts. The only remaining question in Canada appears to be whether or not Justin Trudeau can govern in his own right. I\u2019ll keep you posted. Just by the by. Looks like significant change is afoot in Canada \u2013 our live blog is telling me Stephen Harper looks to be going out the back door. Assistant treasurer Kelly O\u2019Dwyer is being interviewed on the ABC about the Murray inquiry. Losers? Perish the thought! Q: Looking at the funds in the market, who might stand most to lose? Is it the industry super funds typically aligned with unions? Kelly O\u2019Dwyer: I think the better question here is who has to gain? At the end of the day, the individual whose money it is, whose money is being saved for their retirement, stands to benefit because they will be able to make the choice about what is going to be best for them in retirement. So it\u2019s all about who wins, not who loses. My colleague Lenore Taylor is back from the Coalition joint party room debrief. There was a farewell of sorts for Joe Hockey, who will bow out of politics tomorrow. Hockey apparently told colleagues the following: it was important to leave parliament with dignity, he wanted the Turnbull government to be the best in Australian history, but the revolving door had to stop. His former boss, Tony Abbott, paid tribute. Hockey had triumphed at the G20, and he\u2019d produced budgets too brave for this parliament. Abbott also apparently referenced Teddy Roosevelt. We assume this was the reference in question. It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat. A statement just now from the manager of government business Christopher Pyne and the prime minister Malcolm Turnbull. The Australian House of Representatives will trial a new constituency question time that will give members an opportunity to ask specific questions relating to their electorates and the matters raised with them by their constituents. From the next sitting week until the end of the year the government will trial \u2018Constituency Question Time\u2019 to run every sitting day as part of Questions Without Notice. Prime minister Malcolm Turnbull MP said the change to the running of question time will present greater opportunities for government MPs, and if they choose opposition MPs, to bring local issues in their electorate to the attention of relevant ministers. \u201cRepresenting their community is the first priority of every MP, regardless of which side of the House they sit on,\u201d Turnbull said. This change to question time was originally proposed by the Leader of the House, the Hon Christopher Pyne MP, in a speech to the Institute of Public Affairs at the beginning of 2013. \u201cLocal issues are the bread and butter of every member\u2019s job and the genuine concerns of constituents deserve to feature prominently in the parliament,\u201d Mr Pyne said. This will typically involve approximately 5 questions from government members to relevant ministers each day. In another venue the ALP is responding to the government\u2019s announcements on the Murray review earlier today. The shadow treasurer Chris Bowen is attempting to extend an olive branch. Sort of. I say this to treasurer Morrison and the government. We\u2019ve consistently said this would be best done in a bipartisan basis. If the government seeks to play wedge politics on an objective for our superannuation system that would be a most unfortunate approach. If the government chooses to seek bipartisan agreement around a superannuation objective, we would engage in that process and see if it is possible. Jim Chalmers, shadow minister for financial services and superannuation. There is lots of common ground as Chris was saying in his introduction, but there are a couple of areas where there is not yet unanimous agreement as well. I think superannuation is one of those areas where the government\u2019s approach is not the same as the opposition\u2019s approach. Again, the superannuation sector is crucial to the health of our economy. There\u2019s more than $2 trillion under management, that\u2019s 10% bigger this year than the year before. There\u2019s a lot at stake when it comes to superannuation. Super is the hope of the side when it comes to boosting living standards in this country, taking pressure off the pension and creating those deeper pools of capital in our economy as well. It is pleasing to see as Chris said they\u2019re up for a conversation about enshrining the purpose of superannuation in our economic arrangements, because from that then flows a series of other decisions about adequacy and tax concessions and all kinds of important issues in the superannuation system. Beyond that agreement over enshrining the objective of super, there are some areas of disagreement, not just in this report but more broadly. Bottom line? Labor will cop some but not all of this. Q: Minister Dutton can I ask about the \u2018Abyan\u2019 case? Will the government consider what Gillian Triggs has proposed, an arbiter. There\u2019s been reports that the woman doesn\u2019t want to go to Australia for a termination, but would consider going to another country? Peter Dutton: I provided an update to the parliament yesterday and I stated there what the government\u2019s position was. That was to provide support to the individual and that support was provided not only on Nauru, but also subsequently when she came to Australia. We take the advice of the medical experts and those people running the regional processing centres and receive all of the advice and decisions are then made based on that and that\u2019s the way in which it\u2019ll continue into the future, as well. Q: The independent arbiter issue? We have a system in place, which provides support in terms of medical needs. There\u2019s a lot of support there and I think people frankly sometimes speak from ignorance in terms of the amount of support that\u2019s being provided to people who are in need. That system\u2019s operated in the past and that\u2019s how it\u2019ll operate into the future and we don\u2019t propose any changes, because we\u2019re already providing a significant level of support to people to enhance the services provided on Nauru. Q: Does there need to be independent oversight of what happens in offshore detention centres given the Human Rights Commission is not allowed to go in, given there are restrictions on journalists going in - does there need to be an independent body that can report what\u2019s happening? Just to deal with the facts. There are not restrictions on journalists going in. Journalists can make applications as journalists can to come to our country for a visa. There\u2019s a journalist on Nauru today from Australia. That\u2019s to deal with the premise of your question, the opportunity is there for people to travel and people can make their own judgments. We have a number of visits including from the Red Cross, from the UNHCR and others who visit detention centres and that regime, that level of oversight has operated for some period of time. It\u2019s a different situation as you\u2019d appreciate in Nauru and in Manus, because these are issues are ultimately for the Nauruan government or for the PNG government in the case of Manus. (Peter Dutton\u2019s facts on the lack of restrictions would not clear the fact checkers.) Immigration minister Peter Dutton and justice minister Michael Keenan are holding a press conference about recent drug seizures. I\u2019m keeping an ear on that and report any development of interest. My colleague Daniel Hurst is back from the Labor caucus briefing. There were a number of questions from western Sydney MPs about the impact of the proposed second airport. Folks with me yesterday will know the government has now begun a period of consultation about the second Sydney airport. Concerns were raised in caucus about curfews and consultation. The Labor leader Bill Shorten acknowledged that curfews are a vexed issue and indicated Labor would not take a position until the consultations were at an end. The shadow trade minister Penny Wong reported on progress in negotiations with the government about the free trade deal with China. Labor, most readers will know, has concerns about some elements of the CHAFTA. Wong said there was no resolution as yet, but the conversation was proceeding in what appeared to be good faith. The enabling legislation for the agreement is to be debated this week. I mentioned earlier today that the caucus would consider a motion from two backbenchers on immigration detention. That debate was delayed given the senators were not present at today\u2019s meeting due to the estimates timetable. The shadow immigration minister Richard Marles meanwhile told colleagues he\u2019d been briefed by the government about the Somali woman allegedly raped and impregnated on Nauru. Marles signalled Labor would be keeping its statements on this case low key \u2013 he said there were medical issues that were private and should be kept private. Bill Shorten told colleagues the good Ipsos poll for Malcolm Turnbull this week reflected relief from voters that Tony Abbott was no longer the prime minister. He declared Turnbull likes to talk, but he\u2019s missing in action when it comes to delivery. He said the prime minister didn\u2019t lead his party, he followed it. Peace in our time in a picture. Penny for her thoughts, really. Matt Canavan has dashed to the next venue. He is asking about same-sex marriage in the legal and constitutional committee, too. His question is pegged on how the Human Rights Commission (currently before the committee) can defend the principle of non-discrimination and at the same time uphold the law in relation to the Marriage Act, which effectively discriminates based on sexual orientation by preventing same-sex couples from marrying. Community views on marriage have changed, and so should the law, the president of the commission, Gillian Triggs, answers. The debate then turns to how someone would define human rights, with the attorney general contending that being opposed to same-sex marriage and supportive of human rights are not mutually exclusive concepts. Freedom commissioner, Tim Wilson, takes Canavan to task for referring to a person\u2019s sexuality as a \u201cchoice\u201d. In another committee, the LNP senator Matt Canavan is taking the SBS chief Michael Ebeid to task about campaigning in favour of marriage equality. This critique appears to relate to a corporate decision by SBS to oppose all forms of discrimination. A corporate decision, not an editorial one. Canavan thinks this is an abuse of Ebeid\u2019s position. Ebeid, naturally enough, begs to differ. Michael Ebeid: It\u2019s about equality. Matt Canavan: The vibe? Michael Ebeid: No, it\u2019s about equality. Liberal senator Chris Back would like to know what SBS will do to ensure balanced coverage during the plebiscite which will be held to settle the definition of marriage if Malcolm Turnbull wins the next election. Ebeid says SBS always provides balanced coverage. It\u2019s what we do. Back over in estimates, Gillian Triggs is being asked about her call overnight for more oversight of immigration detention. In the chair, the attorney general, George Brandis, suggests immigration detention facilities are in Nauru and in PNG, not in Australian territory. Access can be complex, is the Brandis inference, but he notes the Human Rights Commission can certainly act on its own volition. The Liberal senator Ian MacDonald appears to suggest we might need to invade PNG to gain access. Labor senator Jacinta Collins thinks it probably won\u2019t come to that. Steven Munchenberg, the chief executive of the Australian Bankers\u2019 Association, has been interviewed by the ABC in the wake of the Murray response. Q: Westpac raised interest rates recently because of the capital requirements. Are you expecting other banks to follow? Steven Munchenberg: It has to be down to individual banks. We certainly don\u2019t discuss that with the banks. The reality is higher capital levels make banks stronger but are also additional costs for banks. They will be passed on in part to shareholders, including our own superannuation funds or to customers. Banks will have to make a judgement about how to balance that. Q: This will inevitably lead to increased costs for consumers in some form? The reality is that a stronger, safer banking system is a more expensive one. We will have to pay for that safer banking system. At the end \u2013 I know people sitting around the kitchen table won\u2019t buy this but if we have a strong banking system when the next crisis hits, people won\u2019t lose their jobs and so you can see these additional costs as an investment in a more secure future. What a difference a few months makes. The attorney general, George Brandis, has told Senate estimates that the government is \u201crelaxed\u201d about the Human Rights Commission on occasion \u201ccontradicting\u201d its policies on national security. The agency\u2019s role, Brandis said, is \u201cto be engaged in this debate, and on occasion, to be a contradictor of the government. This is a Liberal government so we are not afraid of hearing a variety of points of view,\u201d the attorney general said. \u201cWe are very relaxed about that. We welcome the free exchange of ideas.\u201d Those comments were contested by Greens senator, Nick McKim. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s an accurate reflection of history,\u201d he said. The language used by the attorney general is in stark contrast to the views put by his Coalition colleagues during an aggressive grilling of the Human Rights Commission president, Gillian Triggs, in Senate estimates earlier this year. Triggs was heavily criticised by government senators of bias due to a report on children in immigration detention. Triggs is currently giving evidence before senate estimates. If this man buys a daggy tracksuit .. .. and this one starts whining about what coulda shoulda been .. clear out. Just saying. I don\u2019t think this Murray response is much of a surprise. Looking like you\u2019ll do something on credit card surcharges is appropriately punter friendly. Trying to dilute the power of the industry super funds by promoting more competition is a long-held ideological fixation for the Liberal party. I\u2019m actually interested in a side point to today\u2019s proceedings. We know that Malcolm Turnbull has to preset reset on the concept of economic reform and on the government\u2019s economic/managerial competence given the disruption of the Abbott period. The new prime minister took the opportunity of today to practice some new narrative concepts in this space. In launching the Murray response, Turnbull harked back to the Howard and Costello era \u2013 a period that many Australian voters will associated with settled governance and with economic prosperity. The new prime minister drew a line from that period to the present, skipping over the turbulent Abbott period almost entirely. While history was being refashioned before our eyes, Turnbull also noted in passing the Howard/Costello prudential regulations had saved Australia from the impact of the global financial crisis. Labor\u2019s period in office, the economic stimulus provided by the then Rudd government during the GFC, a bit like the Abbott period, was omitted from Turnbull\u2019s official record. Pfft to all that. Given Turnbull is in the business of drawing lines, I\u2019ll draw another one. Yesterday in Question Time, Turnbull resumed his old arguments against the Rudd/Swan stimulus package during the GFC. Turnbull said yesterday we are in debt now because Labor spent waaayyy too much during the GFC, not (of course) because Tony Abbott couldn\u2019t get the budget strategy back on track during his two years in the prime ministerial suite, failing to manage the complex shifts going on in the global economy and the domestic scene. It\u2019s pretty obvious that Turnbull is working out where to position himself in one of his key jobs: selling the government\u2019s economic story. Today we got some pretty significant clues. Let the new record show that Malcolm Turnbull got it right when he opposed Labor\u2019s second stimulus package (remember that?). Let it show that Labor completely botched everything including the management of the financial crisis. Let it show the Turnbull/Morrison ticket is like a reborn John Howard and Peter Costello. Competent, considered. Fond of steady power walking and (in Costello\u2019s case) occasional outbreaks of passive aggression. Do please forget about Tony Abbott and Joe Hockey. While you are at it, please forget Labor\u2019s strongest claim to economic credibility \u2013 the argument that policy quick action by Kevin Rudd and Wayne Swan kept Australia out of recession. So yesterday, all that. I gather from Daniel Hurst that the government response to Murray did not reference negative gearing (which he raised as a problem), or super tax concessions. The latter is off to the tax review. Daniel Hurst\u2019s news wrap can be found here. I\u2019ll come back with some analytical thoughts in a second. Well, hello Kelly. Sorry, but you have to laugh. Q: On the default super funds, what\u2019s the case for opening it up to more competition? Is it the performance of the default funds at the moment, the fees they charge? Scott Morrison: It\u2019s simply about choice, and it\u2019s their money. The Murray inquiry has made recommendations along these lines which says that if someone is working in a particular workplace, they should decide where their super goes. I mean that\u2019s a pretty important principle. And more importantly, they shouldn\u2019t be stopped, prevented as they currently are, under various agreements and awards from having their own money going to the fund where they want it to go to. Turnbull needs to zip to the Coalition party room meeting but takes another question on the credit card surcharges. In terms of timing, the prime minister says the new system will be phased in by July next year. Q: Are merchants gouging their customers with surcharges? Malcolm Turnbull: The important point is this, businesses are free to charge their customers what they like in a competitive, you know, a competitive market. There\u2019s no law that says you\u2019ve got to charge so much for a hotel room or an airline flight, whatever. But if you go out there and you say there is a 2 or 3% surcharge for using a credit card, for example, that carries with it, I think we would all agree, a very clear representation, which I don\u2019t think can be disclaimed, a very clear representation that the merchant is recovering the costs of you, the customer, using a card as opposed to paying in cash. And now, the fact is that we all know, it\u2019s very widely known, that in some cases, in many cases, these surcharges are well in excess of the real cost and so it is \u2013 this is just a matter of ensuring that the representation that merchants make is by virtue of regulation an accurate one. The treasurer keeps it simpler. This is a fair dinkum test, Morrison says. First question. Will banks now raise their interest rates? (This is because of the new capital ratios. The banks have already flagged they will have to pass on the costs of ensuring capital adequacy in the new regime.) Malcolm Turnbull: Well, I don\u2019t believe so. The treasurer had some remarks about Westpac\u2019s decision last week, critical of that. I think many people thought that was not necessary but look, you know, we\u2019re running the government, we\u2019re not \u2013 we\u2019ll express some views from time to time about bank\u2019s movements on interest rates but it is ultimately a matter for them and of course for the market. Assistant treasurer Kelly O\u2019Dwyer. I\u2019d like to draw out just a couple (of recommendations) that I think will be of particular interest to those of you here. We obviously agree with the inquiry that superannuation needs to be competitive, it needs to be efficient and overall it needs to be transparent. We need to be able to deliver the best possible outcomes for those people who are contributing to their retirement at their retirement and having an efficient, competitive and transparent system will do just that. We will immediately task the Productivity Commission to develop criteria to assess the competitiveness and the efficiency within the superannuation system. We will also immediately task the Productivity Commission to develop alternative models allocating default fund members to products. In time, the Productivity Commission will assess the efficiency and competition of the superannuation system against this criteria and the government will continue to explore measures around efficiency and competition in the accumulation phase of the superannuation system. Treasurer, Scott Morrison. In terms of the financial system itself, it makes it stronger by embedding deeper protections within the system, whether it\u2019s on capital adequacy, improved governance and standards right across the system and empowering our regulators to be able to enforce the protections that are in that system \u2013 protect consumers and Australians and our economy at the end of the day. It does provide Australians with greater choice and greater control over their own money, whether it\u2019s their superannuation or anything else. It\u2019s their money and they need to be in the driver\u2019s seat when it comes to their money and our response to the inquiry today puts Australians in the driver\u2019s seat of their own money and no-one else and that\u2019s as it should be. It does end the closed shop when it comes to mandatory superannuation contributions and how they are directed off into funds, and it will give Australians greater choice about where they invest their own money for their own retirement. The prime minister opens his press conference in narrative mode \u2013 the changes announced today are part of a continuous thread of Liberal National Party governments delivering prudent regulation of the financial system. He thanks Joe Hockey and Josh Frydenberg for their preliminary work, but he notes that a line has been drawn. This response is a response of the Turnbull government to this inquiry. Cutting to the chase. Consumers will like the credit card surcharges change \u2013 industry super funds will hate the superannuation changes. Here comes the prime minister. The Turnbull government has vowed to crack down on excessive surcharges for credit card transactions and will also move to enshrine the objective of the superannuation system in legislation. The government is also planning to launch a Productivity Commission review into \u201cthe efficiency and competitiveness\u201d of the super system, with an eye to changing the existing process for allocating default fund members to products. The measures are part of the government\u2019s response to the financial system inquiry, which also suggested action to increase the capital held by banks so that they were \u201cunquestionably strong\u201d and resilient during times of crisis. The government announced on Tuesday that it would support most of the 44 recommendations made by the review team led by the former Commonwealth Bank chief David Murray. The Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority is leading the process of increasing mortgage risk weights for the big banks and ensuring they have stronger capital ratios - a process that has already been cited by Westpac as a justification for its decision to increase mortgage interest rates. The government has agreed to take action to improve fee and surcharging arrangements for credit card transactions, which could reduce the costs faced by consumers when they buy products at shops and restaurants. \u201cWe will phase in a legislated ban on surcharges that exceed the reasonable costs faced by merchants in accepting card,\u201d the government said. \u201cWe will also make the ACCC responsible for enforcing the ban on excessive surcharging.\u201d The government is yet to define what it would consider to be unreasonably high surcharges. Enshrining the objective of the super system in legislation would \u201cserve as a guide to policy makers, regulators, industry and the community about superannuation\u2019s fundamental purpose\u201d. In a sign the government might be positioning itself to rein in super concessions for high income earners, the document said the legislated objective would \u201cprovide a framework for important discussions Australia needs to have about fairness, adequacy and dignity in the superannuation system\u201d. The embargo on the Murray recommendations has just been lifted. If you want to read the full material you can find it here. Investigative reporter Pam Williams has produced a long piece in The Australian today about Malcolm Turnbull taking the leadership of the Liberal party from Tony Abbott. Doubtless there will be choice anecdotes but I\u2019ve only had time to skim it thus far. Readers can find it here. A prime ministerial press conference on the Murray report is scheduled for 9.15am. Estimates hearings will also be back underway shortly, I\u2019ll tune in to the various hearings during the day as time permits. News wire service AAP also tells me two Labor MPs will today seek the backing of caucus colleagues to end support for offshore detention of asylum seekers. West Australian MP Melissa Parke and NSW MP Jill Hall believe the detention program is a waste of money and could be likened to \u201ctorture\u201d. The pair will seek a caucus vote on a motion calling for an end to indefinite detention. Party room meetings will get underway this morning, with House of Representatives sitting at noon. Fellow politics tragics will know an election is underway in Canada that might see the end of the Harper government. Naturally we are covering that event live, and you can check in here. The latest blog summary notes with several hours yet until polls close, the race is still very much a close call. While still in the other hemisphere, we can also note former prime minister Julia Gillard has appeared in a campaign endorsement for the Democratic presidential aspirant, Hillary Clinton. Julia Gillard: Hillary Clinton understood in her heart how important it was for girls to get an opportunity, but she also understood in her head that if we want to build peaceful, economically prosperous nations, then we have to educate girls. She was determined to see that women take their place as economic partners in their community, and take their place as political leaders in their community. (Who runs the world? Girls girls. Who runs the world ..) To Four Corners before we get run down by the Murray inquiry. The only thing you can say about last night\u2019s program is .. extraordinary television .. but you had to have the stomach to inhabit a very, very strange universe. Monday night\u2019s program was in essence a fly-on-the-wall documentary about the lives of the former Health Services Union official Kathy Jackson and her husband Michael Lawler. Lawler (an appointee of Tony Abbott when he was workplace minister in the Howard government) is vice-president of the Fair Work Commission. The pair supplied Four Corners with a wealth of new angles in a story that was already an airport novel saga \u2013 covert recording of phone calls, an explicit concession from Lawler that Jackson may have committed criminal offences, home videos recording trips taken at HSU expense. It was a complete car crash, and their too obvious consent to document their own car crash in minute detail (including supplying re-enactments of choice moments) is impossible to fathom. ABC reporter Caro Meldrum-Hanna managed to assume an heroic deadpan expression throughout the quite mad encounters depicted in her report, which underscored the gap between reality and the world the two protagonists have created for themselves and each other. Ahead of the program going to air, the employment minister Michaelia Cash confirmed that former federal court judge Peter Heerey will conduct an independent review. Michaelia Cash: It is essential that public confidence is maintained in the institution of the Fair Work Commission. I will not be commenting on the specific complaints before the independent investigator has had an opportunity to report back to me on this matter. Hello good people and welcome to Tuesday. As we go live this morning a number of my colleagues are locked up downstairs in a briefing about the Murray inquiry. The government intends to respond today to the recommendations delivered last year by former banker and Future Fund supremo, David Murray. Murray was tasked by Tony Abbott and Joe Hockey to look at Australia\u2019s banking sector and advise the government how to make improvements to strengthen financial resilience and to boost competition. He recommended the banks increase their current capital ratios to ensure they were in a position to absorb future financial shocks \u2013 a move the banks say will increase costs to shareholders or customers. In addition to recommendations about better regulation of financial advisers, and lowering bank interchange fees, Murray also recommended a number of tax reform measures, criticising generous housing and superannuation concessions. It will be interesting to see how the government responds. My colleague Daniel Hurst is in the briefing and we expect to have particulars shortly after 9am. To non-Murray matters, the news cycle this morning is following through the major issues from yesterday. After a day in estimates going over the details of Tony Abbott\u2019s (alleged) boozy farewell in the cabinet suite which resulted in the destruction of a bespoke marble topped table (yes, the Incredible Hulk is rumoured to have made an appearance) \u2013 the former prime minister has now agreed to pick up the tab. In a statement issued last night, Abbott said: On the night of the leadership change I hosted drinks in the cabinet anteroom for staff and colleagues. During this event a coffee table was damaged. I have asked my office to have the Department of Parliamentary Services invoice me for the value of the table. It was my event so I take responsibility for it. Abbott has not, thus far at least, indicated that he\u2019ll pick up the tab for the booze. Officials confirmed last night tired and emotional guests were served beverages from the official alcohol stash. I\u2019ll get to Four Corners in the next post (I don\u2019t know about you but I\u2019m still recovering) but another significant thing to bookmark is a call by the Human Rights Commission president Gillian Triggs for greater oversight of immigration detention centres. In an interview last night on the Lateline program, Triggs has criticised the treatment of the Somali refugee who was allegedly raped and impregnated on Nauru. The woman was then brought to Australia for a termination before being dispatched quickly back to Nauru without the termination. Refugee advocates and immigration minister Peter Dutton have been jousting over the specific details of the case for several days. Gillian Triggs: A young woman, 23 years old, obviously very distressed from the facts to the extent that one can glean them, a woman who really needs counselling and a safe environment. It\u2019s extraordinary that she was expected to reach a decision in such a short space of time and when the answer wasn\u2019t given immediately she\u2019s literally air lifted back to Nauru. It makes a much broader point that the lack of transparency, the secrecy with which we conduct these detention centres and what goes on in them and of course in our own detention centres in Australia, that is really a core problem and why we really need some form of independent monitoring. That we do. We really, really do. Perhaps the government could use its renewed interest in human rights (we heard something of this from the foreign minister and the attorney-general yesterday) to deliver on that modest imperative. There\u2019s another terrible story around this morning: an Afghan asylum seeker living in Australia on a bridging visa is feared dead after he self-immolated during a video call with refugee advocates. It\u2019s time to open today\u2019s Politics Live conversation. Consider the thread at your disposal. I\u2019m also at your disposal on the Twits. You can find me there @murpharoo and Jerry Seinfeld, AKA Mikearoo, is at @mpbowers Fire up the office Nespresso. Get a Monte Carlo, you might need one. Here comes Tuesday.",

Instead, Trudeau has offered only to meet with provincial leaders and come up with a plan to put a price on carbon and fight climate change within 90 days of the election.</p> <p>On the plus side, Trudeau is prepared to talk about climate change \u2013 unlike Harper who gave the issue short shrift. Trudeau has also committed to setting up a $2bn fund to help the country move to a low carbon economy.</p> <p>Expect some interesting phone conversations with Barack Obama when the US president calls to offer his congratulations. The relationship between Obama and Harper was notably frosty, in large part because of Harper\u2019s persistent lobbying for the Keystone XL, and his determination to expand the tar sands and turn Canada into an energy superpower.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5625c495e4b0c066531ace4e\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-10-20T04:37:08.769Z\">5.37am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Trudeau: 'we beat fear with hope'</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>\u201cWe beat fear with hope, we beat cynicism with hard work.

His main challenger is Liberal Mark Holland, a former MP who has been gunning hard to win back his seat. The Syrian refugee crisis \u2013 and the perception the Conservatives fumbled their handling of the issue during the campaign - may have given Holland the ammunition he needed. <br></p> <p><strong>Eglinton-Lawrence:</strong> Another Conservative cabinet minister - Finance Minister Joe Oliver - is facing stiff competition from Liberal candidate Marco Mendicino. Mendicino fought hard just to win the nomination in this riding after Conservative-turned-Liberal MP Eve Adams made a play to carry the Liberal banner here. Oliver was largely absent from the public eye during the campaign \u2013 even as Canada dipped briefly into recession \u2013 as he focused on keeping his seat. <br></p> <h2>Quebec</h2> <p>\u201cQuebec was supposed to stay NDP orange this election. Still, as the party fell in the polls, many ridings became three, even four way races between the Liberals, the Conservatives, the NDP and the Bloc Quebecois.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Laurier Sainte Marie:</strong> The incumbent in this downtown Montreal riding is New Democrat MP Helene Laverdiere, who stole this from Bloc Quebecois leader Gilles Duceppe in 2011. Duceppe quit politics but came back to lead the faltering Bloc shortly before this campaign began. Bets are lining up behind Laverdiere managing to hold on and defeat the Bloc leader twice in a row. </p> <p><strong>Mount Royal:</strong> This Montreal riding was a safe Liberal seat for years under popular - and widely respected across the aisles - MP Irwin Cotler. Cotler has resigned and the Conservatives, who have had their eye on this seat for ages, are running star candidate Robert Libman, a well-known provincial and municipal politician. Conservative leader Stephen Harper even launched his campaign in this riding back in August. The Liberals are running Anthony Housefather, another popular local politician, and it looks like this riding will stay red. </p> <p><strong>Outremont:</strong> New Democrat leader Tom Mulcair won this riding in 2008, establishing a beachhead for the party in Quebec which culminated in the \u201cOrange Wave\u201d that swept the province in 2011. Now, this safe seat is under threat as the party\u2019s fortunes took a tumble in polls and with the Liberals looking like they\u2019ll make gains on the island of Montreal. Mulcair\u2019s Liberal challenger is lawyer Rachel Bendayan. </p> <h2>British Columbia </h2> <p>\u201cCanada\u2019s westernmost province is three hours behind the most populated provinces of Canada (Ontario and Quebec) where elections are often decided. But in this election the province is considered a battleground.\u201d</p> <p><strong>North Vancouver:</strong> The incumbent Conservative is Andrew Saxton..

          "bodyText": "We\u2019re wrapping up this live blog now, but keeping up with all the fallout and reaction over on our new blog here: Before you go, here\u2019s how the night panned out: The Liberal party has won a convincing majority, taking 185 seats. Canadians in every province voted for Liberal candidates, who won in striking victories in greater Toronto and Quebec. Justin Trudeau, son of arguably Canada\u2019s most famous politician, former prime minister Pierre Trudeau, follows his father into the role. After rousing his party from third in the polls to first place on voting day, Trudeau promised \u201csunny ways\u201d for all Canadians: This is what positive politics can do. This is what a positive, hopeful, a hopeful vision, and a platform and a team together can make happen. Canadians from all across this great country sent a clear message tonight, it\u2019s time for a change in this country, my friends, a real change. Outgoing prime minister Stephen Harper conceded the election after nearly 10 years in office, saying, \u201cthe people are never wrong\u201d. He will step down as leader of the Conservative party, which took 100 seats. The leftwing New Democratic Party (NDP) \u2013 previously the official opposition to Harper\u2019s government \u2013 suffered major losses, slumping to 42 seats. Leader Thomas Mulcair conceded to Trudeau and found solace in the humiliation of the Conservatives: Canadians have turned the page on 10 long years. They have rejected the politics of fear and division. The civilised finish of the vote counting means no early-hours scramble to get the result into the morning papers: Although he decided not to mention it in his speech earlier, outgoing prime minister Stephen Harper is stepping down as leader of the Conservatives. Speaking to supporters in Calgary after it became apparent that Liberal leader Justin Trudeau had ousted him, Harper conceded: \u201cThe people are never wrong.\u201d Turnout for the election was 65.5% (that\u2019s with 96.69% of ridings having reported). That\u2019s a boost on 2011\u2019s 61.1%, and the 58.8% recorded in 2008. The prime minister-elect is keen to get going: Hello, this is Claire Phipps taking over from Alan Yuhas as the fallout continues from the Liberals\u2019 stunning victory over Stephen Harper\u2019s Conservatives. With an outright majority under his belt, what will be Justin Trudeau\u2019s priorities as a new prime minister? Here\u2019s what he said before the election: Trudeau on climate change He has promised a climate change policy agreed with the provinces within 90 days of the UN climate change summit in Paris in November. On indigenous rights \u201cWe will build a renewed relationship with indigenous peoples on a nation-to-nation basis,\u201d he has said. \u201cThat will include, for example, a national public inquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women and girls. It will include $2.6bn over four years for First Nations education.\u201d On abortion He is pro-choice: \u201cIt is not for any government to legislate what a woman chooses to do with her body. And that is the bottom line.\u201d On taxes His first move will be to raise taxes on the richest 1% to fund cuts for the middle classes. On marijuana Trudeau has said he would start moves to legalise it \u201cright away\u201d, based on theColorado model. On feminism You can read more here: My colleague Claire Phipps is going to take over our live coverage of the election, which ended with a stunning victory for the Liberal party of Justin Trudeau and an end to the nearly 10-year tenure of Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper. The Liberal party won 184 seats in Parliament, enough for a secure majority government and more than enough to lift Justin Trudeau to prime minister elect. Canadians in every province voted for Liberal candidates, who won in especially striking victories in greater Toronto and Quebec. Trudeau, who began the 78-day campaign as a third-place underdog, vowed to realize an inclusive vision of Canada through \u201csunny ways\u201d. \u201cCanadians from all across this great country sent a clear message tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s time for a change in this country, real change.\u201d The son of former prime minister Pierre Trudeau, the ascendant MP adopted rhetoric of hope and repudiated the \u201cnegative, divisive politics\u201d of the campaign. \u201cConservatives are not our enemies, they\u2019re our neighbors.\u201d Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper conceded the election after nearly 10 years in office, saying, \u201cthe people are never wrong.\u201d Harper\u2019s party announced that he would step down as leader, but he also vowed Conservatives would return in new force as the official opposition. Conservatives won 102 seats but were starkly outperformed in Toronto, where they had hoped for a close contest. The New Democratic Party (NDP) suffered major losses to the Liberals\u2019 benefit, and leader Thomas Mulcair conceded to Trudeau while promising to work with the new government. Mulcair also celebrated the Conservatives\u2019 defeat. \u201cCanadians have turned the page on 10 long years,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have rejected the politics of fear and division.\u201d My colleague Nicky Woolf is in Calgary, where the Conservatives are trying to put on a brave face after the election defeat and news that prime minister Stephen Harper will step down as party leader. After Harper had finished speaking, the bright lights came on and the room emptied quickly and without much ceremony. Zach Isaac, a 25-year-old party volunteer from Calgary, who was one of the loudest cheerers during Harper\u2019s speech and was festooned with buttons and signs, told the Guardian that while he was disappointed that Canadians picked \u201cthe opposite of a fiscally responsible agenda,\u201d he was nonetheless \u201cvery pleased to see the death of the federal NDP.\u201d \u201cI will be celebrating the death of the NDP all night,\u201d he said, showing the Guardian a badge that had the NDP in a crossed circle sign. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sad,\u201d said Kevin Thiessen, a Conservative party member originally from Ontario, adding that he was \u201cpretty disappointed\u201d with his home province. \u201cI feel kinda betrayed by Ontario,\u201d he said. \u201cThe last election, they saved the day. Now where the hell are they?\u201d Standing with him was his friend Nathaniel Milljour, a cartoonist for the National Firearms Association, the Canadian equivalent of the American National Rifle Association. \u201cHarper got bashed on social media for things that didn\u2019t exist,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was betrayed, though. It\u2019s unforgivable. And it\u2019s Ontario that did the back-stabbing.\u201d Trudeau\u2019s challenges will begin almost immediately, my colleague Suzanne Goldenberg writes from Washington, starting with Canada\u2019s climate change policy. Canada\u2019s new PM has committed to restoring environmental laws and budgets dismantled by Harper, but on the two biggest issues \u2013 Keystone XL pipeline and emissions reductions target \u2013 Trudeau is bound to disappoint. Trudeau, despite attacking Harper for his pro-oil, anti-climate positions, is for the Keystone XL pipeline, the project that more than any other has symbolised the deep divisions over the future of the vast carbon reserves known as the Alberta tar sands. And he has resisted setting a target for cutting carbon pollution. Instead, Trudeau has offered only to meet with provincial leaders and come up with a plan to put a price on carbon and fight climate change within 90 days of the election. On the plus side, Trudeau is prepared to talk about climate change \u2013 unlike Harper who gave the issue short shrift. Trudeau has also committed to setting up a $2bn fund to help the country move to a low carbon economy. Expect some interesting phone conversations with Barack Obama when the US president calls to offer his congratulations. The relationship between Obama and Harper was notably frosty, in large part because of Harper\u2019s persistent lobbying for the Keystone XL, and his determination to expand the tar sands and turn Canada into an energy superpower. \u201cWe beat fear with hope, we beat cynicism with hard work. We beat negative, divisive politics with a positive vision that brings Canadians together,\u201d Trudeau says, heading toward the end of his speech. \u201cMost of all we defeated the idea that Canadians should be satisfied with less, that good enough is good enough, and that better just isn\u2019t possible. Well, my friends, this is Canada, and in Canada better is always possible.\u201d And with that Trudeau gives his parting waves to the crowd, wife at his side, and slowly works his way off stage. Trudeau wraps up his victory speech by promising to \u201cmake that vision a reality\u201d that Canadians have asked for, and that he pledges to listen to all the voters who came out to the polls. He concludes with a story about meeting a Muslim mother who told him she was voting Liberal because \u201cshe wants to make sure that her little girl has the right to make her own choices in life, and that the government will protect those rights.\u201d \u201cCanada was built by people from all corners of the world,\u201d he says, an implicit repudiation of some of the Harper administration\u2019s policies. \u201cWe believe in our hearts that this country\u2019s unique diversity is a blessing bestowed upon us by previous generations of Canadians. Canadians who stared down prejudice and discrimination in all its forms.\u201d He says that Canadians \u201cknow in their heart of hearts that a Canadian is a Canadian is a Canadian\u201d. The prime minister elect then takes a few shots at his predecessor and the Conservative government, saying that Canadians want a country that is stronger not \u201cin spite of its differences, but because of them\u201d. He adds government transparency, trust in its citizens, the rights of indigenous people and a few other items on the laundry list of progressive complaints with the Harper administration. Trudeau turns around the campaign acclaim onto the crowd, and by the millions of Canadians who voted Liberal: \u201cI didn\u2019t make history tonight, you did.\u201d Over the past three years you told us what you\u2019re going through. You told us it\u2019s getting harder and harder to make endsmeet. You told us you\u2019re worried about whether you\u2019ll be able to afford a dignified retirement. \u2026 You are the inspiration for our efforts, you are the reason we worked so hard to be where we are tonight, and you will be at the heart of this new government. Trudeau says his message to his fellow citizens \u201cis simple\u201d: \u201cHave faith in your fellow citizens and country \u2026 Know that we can make anything happen if we work hard.\u201d \u201cLots of people are going to have lots of opinions about why we were successful,\u201d Trudeau says. \u201cWell for three years we had a very old fashioned strategy, we met with and we talked with them, and we listened.\u201d He says he met with people in the Arctic, in Brampton, and that Canadians \u2013 \u201cyou\u201d \u2013 \u201cbuilt this platform, you built this movement. You told us what you need to be successful, you told us what government you want to have.\u201d The cheers keep coming after nearly ever opportunity the crowd gets, with a smattering of more idiosyncratic shouts in the mix. \u201cAll of these people had one thing in common, they cared deeply about their families, their neighbors and their country,\u201d Trudeau says of the volunteers in his campaign. \u201cThey believe that better is possible and that active citizens can play a real part in making it happen.\u201d \u201cI want to take a moment to speak about my colleagues across the aisle,\u201d he continues. \u201cStephen Harper has served this country for a decade,\u201d he says, \u201cand as with anyone [who devotes themselvest to service] we thank him for his service.\u201d Trudeau recalls a conversation with Harper about their respective families, and says there\u2019s a lesson there for Canadians. \u201cI want to remind everyone, as I\u2019ve said many times over the course of this campaign, conservatives are not our enemies, they\u2019re our neighbors.\u201d Trudeau is speaking in French, and barely able to speak to the crowd in a hoarse voice over their frequent cheers. Back in English, he thanks his friends, his district, his team and supporters, who helped show him: \u201cyou can appeal to the better angels of our nature, and you can win while doing it.\u201d \u201cTonight my very good friends, we proved that. I hope it is an inspiration to like-minded people to step up and pitch in. To get involved in the public life in this country and to know that a positive, optimistic, hopeful vision of public life isn\u2019t a naive dream, it can be a powerful force for change.\u201d \u201cSunny ways, my friends, sunny ways,\u201d Trudeau begins. \u201cThis is what positive politics can do. This is what a positive, hopeful, a hopeful vision, and a platform and a team together can make happen. \u201cCanadians from all across this great country sent a clear message tonight, it\u2019s time for a change in this country, my friends, a real change.\u201d Trudeau is arriving on stage now at the Liberal headquarters, also in Montreal \u2013 the cheers and applause are drowning out the speakers, and the crowds are thronging for high-fives and cellphone pictures. Harper finishes his concession speech as if totally unfazed that his nearly 10 years as Canada\u2019s prime minister are coming to an end. He praises the country and government that his Conservatives have built, saying \u201cThis is the Canada to which for the countless generations to come, we will be dedicated.\u201d And though the Conservative party president announced that Harper will step down as leader, the prime minister himself only alluded to the decision in passing, if that, saying he trusted the people\u2019s decision, accepted their \u201cseventh mandate\u201d and that the party would return stronger than ever in the next election. Harper goes on: \u201cThis is the seventh mandate you have given me.\u201d He says he won\u2019t let his constituents down, thanking them emphatically. \u201cTonight, friends we have been able to elect a strong official opposition to the offices of Parliament.\u201d \u201cFor all of those who have over the past decade and a half built our party and contributed to our campaign, you have our deepest gratitude and should feel nothing but pride.\u201d \u201cThe disappointment you must also feel is my responsibility and mine alone,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen the next time comes this party will offer Canadians a strong alternative based on strong Canadian values.\u201d Harper takes the stage to cheers and chants. \u201cAfter 11 weeks it feels very good to be here with you at home in Calgary.\u201d He says he entered public service because \u201cwe believe that hard working Canadians should keep more of the money that they earn, because we believe that government should not [intervene in how] manage their money on their own.\u201d \u201cDuring the past nine and a half years it has been a great honor to serve as your prime minister.\u201d \u201cTo put it all on the line we gave everything we have to give,\u201d he says, and has no regrets: \u201chow could we, we live in the best country in the world.\u201d \u201cI have spoken with Mr Trudeau and offered my congratulations, all our congratulations, on his successful campaign.\u201d He says he has offered his full cooperation in the transition to a new government. Conservative president John Walsh has announced that prime minister Stephen Harper will step down as leader of the party, even as Harper takes the podium in Calgary to make a statement himself. \u201cI have spoken to Prime Minister Stephen Harper and he has instructed me to reach out to the newly elected parliamentary caucus to appoint an Interim Leader,\u201d Walsh wrote in the announcement, \u201cand to the National Council to implement the leadership selection process pursuant to the Conservative Party of Canada constitution.\u201d Elizabeth May, leader of the Green Party, has said that she spoke with Justin Trudeau as well, telling CBC she\u2019s urged the prime-minister elect to get thinking about climate change. \u201cWhen can we sit down and talk about the climate conference,\u201d May said she asked Trudeau. \u201cWe only have 40 days for Canada to get our act together.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m very concerned that we have to rebuild the damage that Stephen Harper has done to our laws, to some of our policies, to our reputation in the world.\u201d Jessica Murphy, in Montreal with the New Democrats, reports on the threatened incumbent Ruth Ellen Brosseau, who preserved her seat from a Liberal challenge. The single mother became the symbol for a number of NDP \u2018paper candidates\u2019 who won in the province in 2011. The young bar manager didn\u2019t live in the riding \u2013 never even visited \u2013 barely spoke French, and jetted off to Las Vegas during the campaign. But she put her head down, practiced her French, and spent nearly every weekend in her riding, eventually winning over the skeptical community. At this point, New Democrats are holding on to about 35 seats, down from the 103 they won in 2011. Mulcair, who won re-election, continues to thank the NDP voters and does not suggest that he will resign as party leader. \u201cNew Democrats have made historic contributions to better this country,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd we will continue.\u201d \u201cThe NDP will always be there for Quebecers, always be a real choice for Quebecers. The next chapter begins in our effort to build a better Canada.\u201d Meanwhile, at Conservative HQ, my colleague Nicky Woolf finds an even more demure audience awaiting prime minister Stephen Harper. The Huffington Post\u2019s Sarah Rieger tweets that \u201cHarper has reportedly called both Trudeau and Mulcair.\u201d \u201cCanadians have turned the page on 10 long years and they have rejected the politics of fear and division,\u201d NDP leader Thomas Mulcair tells his party in Montreal. He says that the NDP will continue to serve Canadians, and looks forward to working with the new majority government despite the party\u2019s differences with the Liberals and Conservatives. \u201cWe accept [Canadians\u2019] choice in all humility,\u201d he says. \u201cDespite our many differences on policy and on teh way policies should be conducted, I thank Mr Harper for his service to our country. I thank Mr Trudeau for his campaign and commitment to his party.\u201d In particular, he says that the NDP\u2019s causes of healthcare, fighting climate change and working for indigenous people will remain the party\u2019s priorities. \u201cCanadians have asked us to work for them,\u201d he says. \u201cWe will not let them down.\u201d He\u2019s been called scion, boxer, inexperienced, also-ran and \u201cdauphin\u201d, and soon he\u2019ll be prime minister \u2013 who is Justin Trudeau? \u201cAlmost literally born to the role of prime minister,\u201d my colleague Claire Phipps writes of the Liberal leader, \u201che took a circuitous route into political life, trying his hand at teaching, engineering, bungee-jumping coaching, environmental geography, charity boxing and acting.\u201d But Trudeau\u2019s appeal to the centre ground risked losing out to both its neighbours, the New Democrats to the left and the Conservatives to the right. What changed? Harper\u2019s tactics, referring to his challenger condescendingly as \u201cJustin\u201d and campaign ads that poked fun at his \u201cnice hair\u201d, found no grip among a section of the electorate that wanted the Conservatives out at all costs, and increasingly saw Trudeau as the best chance of achieving that. The Toronto Blue Jays are winning 11-4 in the eighth, Justin Trudeau\u2019s Liberal party is dominating in the polls and projected to win 188 seats. The internet does its work. While the scale of the Liberal victory is yet unknown, the fact of the win itself makes history, making this \u201conly the second time in Canada\u2019s history that a party has gone from third place in Parliament to first,\u201d per the BBC\u2019s Anthony Zurcher. The official election site still gives Liberals a commanding majority of Parliaments 338 seats. Liberals: 127 elected, leading in 186 ridings, 41.5% of the vote Conservatives: 72 elected, leading in 108 ridings, 31.8% of the vote NDP: 14 elected, leading in 33 ridings, 18.4% of the vote Bloc Quebecois: three elected, leading in 10 ridings, 4.6% of the vote Jessica Murphy, reporting from the Liberal headquarters/discotheque in Montreal, tweets about the band of voters that Conservatives may have been counting on too much. The Liberals have ousted Chris Alexander, minister of citizenship and immigration, from his seat in an important Toronto suburb, Ajax. Alexander drew stark criticism for the Conservative government\u2019s handling of the Syrian refugee crisis \u2013 his office ceased processing refugees at the prime minister\u2019s orders \u2013 and over a debate over niqabs and citizenship that was called \u201cdisgusting\u201d by the Liberal party. Toronto\u2019s large immigrant population, in particular, was surprised to find itself at the center of a contentious campaign issue \u2026 and with the rest of Canada seems to have voiced its opinion, emphatically, at the polls. The official results site still projects a healthy lead for the Liberals \u2013 11 seats over the threshold for a majority government, thanks in part to surprisingly large leads throughout Quebec and Toronto. If the Liberals can hold onto their victories in Quebec, it will be the first time the party\u2019s won most of the province since the original Trudeau. No matter what, their victories represent a devastating defeat for the parties most associated with Quebec, the Bloc Quebecois and the separatist Parti Quebecois. The separatists had hoped for a resurgence under flamboyant media tycoon Pierre Karl Peladeau \u2013 but even the usually solid Bloc, projected to win only 10 ridings, struggled to make a mark in its home state. The Liberals have also dominated Toronto, including in ridings where Conservatives thought themselves assured for victories \u2013 or at least tough fights. In particular, the riding of former mayor Rob Ford has rode extraordinarily far away from the bombastic family of Conservatives who led the city for four years. A tale of two parties. The Liberals in Montreal. And my colleague Nicky Woolf with the Conservatives in Alberta. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna change before the evening ends but it\u2019s not going to end in any dramatic fashion,\u201d CBC host Peter Mansbridge pronounces in vociferously cautious fashion, shortly before the network declares the Liberals will hold a majority government. He manages a small exclamation point, though, noting that the Liberals \u2013 set to have Justin Trudeau replace Stephen Harper as prime minister \u2013 came into the election with only 34 seats, coming off the worst defeat in party history in 2011. The Canadian news network notes that so far the Liberals look to have an edge throughout much of Toronto, even in a riding where they thought they had little chance. The Globe and Mail also calls it for the Liberals. Although the projections are not final, the official results page now puts Liberals in command of 179 ridings, 46.9% of the vote, enough for a majority government, but in more than a dozen of those races only a handful of votes separate first and second places, and none of the networks have yet called a majority. My colleague, reporting from Conservative HQ in Alberta, is less circumspect. As a bleak consolation, sitting prime minister, Stephen Harper, has won re-election in his own riding even as his Conservatives have lost the national race to the Liberals. Conservatives are projected to win 97 seats, 28.1% of the vote. The NDP has won 22 ridings, per the projection, and 17.8% of the vote. The Bloc Quebecois trails last, with nine ridings and 2.9%. My colleague Nicky Woolf, reporting from the Conservative headquarters in Alberta, keeps his voice down but tweets loudly about what looks like a punishing defeat for the party in a critical Toronto suburb. The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Paul Vieira hears what Guy Giorno, Stephen Harper\u2019s campaign chairman, makes so far of what happened to his man\u2019s push for re-election. With Trudeau\u2019s lead looking unshakeable and victory called by the major networks, two major questions remain: will the Liberals have enough \u2013 170 ridings \u2013 to command a majority government, and will Stephen Harper resign as leader of the Conservatives when he steps down as prime minister? Conservatives are not out from preventing the Liberals a majority government, writes John Barber from Toronto, one of the most hard fought regions. The Conservatives are winning 37% of votes cast so far in Ontario, bettering the share accorded to them by pre-election polls. But an ongoing collapse in NDP support has so far put the Liberals far ahead as NDP voters continue to flock to Trudeau. The Liberals are now leading or elected in 10 seats in Montreal, capturing more than half the popular vote, with the Conservatives and New Democrats trailing badly. A terrible night for the New Democrats could climax with leader Tom Mulcair losing his own seat Outremont, where he now trails his Liberal opponent by a substantial number of votes. It might be too early to predict Mulcair\u2019s defeat in the Montreal riding of Outremont, though early results showed him with fewer than a quarter of votes cast so far. The official tally so far: Liberals: 33 elected, leading in 152 ridings in all, 52.4% Conservatives: three elected, leading in 942 ridings, 24.9% NDP: one elected, leading in 25 ridings, 17.6% Bloc Quebecois: leading in eight ridings, 1.6% The official projections continue to show Liberals in the lead, although many races in the dense Toronto area are far from being tallied in full. Polls have just closed in British Columbia, meaning the deluge of exit polls and counted ballots will only increase in the next hour. Liberals: 128 ridings, 55.7% of the vote Conservatives: 7- ridings, 22% NDP: 14 ridings, 17.5% Bloc Quebecois: three ridings, 0.7% The official results page now projects an increasingly commanding lead for the Liberals, apparently at the expense of the NDP, and the Conservatives gaining with a not insignificant share of what progressives did not claim. Liberals: 83 ridings, 57.9% of the vote Conservatives: 42 ridings, 19.9% NDP: 11 ridings, 17.5% Although the networks have called victory for Trudeau and the Liberals, it\u2019s not clear whether the latter have enough clout to actually pull off a majority government. At Stephen Harper\u2019s headquarters in Alberta, the Conservatives\u2019 election night party has gotten to a modest if not downright glum start, my colleague Nicky Woolf reports. Doors have just opened at the Telus Center, a convention hall in downtown Alberta, for Stephen Harper and the Conservatives\u2019 election night party. The room \u2013 which has a capacity of 1,000 but is set up to seat far fewer than that \u2013 is a notably modest one by the standard of these affairs. An organiser tells me that 1600 people have confirmed as attending, but says he has \u201cno idea\u201d how many will turn up. Conservative supporters try to remain upbeat in the face of what looks like the coming storm, however. Three generations of Bray family voters are among the first partygoers in; Albert and Julia Bray, their daughter Susan and her husband Wally Welch, and their granddaughter Lindsay. Lindsey is 19, and has just voted for the first time - she says she voted Conservative because, largely, of Harper\u2019s stance on Israel. \u201cI\u2019m a big supporter of Israel and Harper took a big stand,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m proud of that.\u201d Julia says she\u2019s surprised at the results coming out of Atlantic Canada. \u201cThe night\u2019s not over yet,\u201d Albert says. I ask if which way they think the results tonight will go, and Wally holds his hand out palm-flat, shaking it side-to-side. His wife, however, remains hopeful. \u201cI\u2019m thinking positively that it\u2019s going to turn out well for the Conservatives,\u201d she says. I look at Wally. \u201cI feel the same way as my wife,\u201d he says. Canada\u2019s major news networks, CTV and CBC, have called the election for the Liberals and Justin Trudeau, with the official results pouring in but nowhere near finished. As of now: Liberals: 57 seats Conservatives: 18 NDP: 6 Any minute now we should start getting results from the vast bulk of the Canadian electorate: greater Toronto, Quebec, all of Ontario and the eastern, central and mountain time zones. Conservatives and Liberals fought hard for the dense suburbs around Toronto, and the NDP and Liberals in Quebec, where the Bloc Quebecois also played a role in shaping the race. These cities and provinces will prove the keys to forming a minority government for any party, and no party could manage a majority without significant victories here. \u201cThis federal election is very different from the last campaign in 2011 in any number of ways,\u201d writes Jessica Murphy from Montreal, finding parallels where she can with the Harper victory. In 2011, the Liberal and NDP election headquarters were both in downtown Toronto, within walking distance of each other, where the each party\u2019s former leaders, Michael Ignatieff and Jack Layton, respectively, had their seats. This year, both the Liberals and the New Democrats are once again in the same city - Montreal this time \u2013 and with HQs within walking distance of each other. Both leaders have their ridings in downtown Montreal \u2013 New Democrat Tom Mulcair\u2019s is Outremont, which is directly adjacent to Papineau, Liberal leader Justin Trudeau\u2019s riding. Soon she\u2019ll head off to the Liberal headquarters nearby, which, if the tweets are to be believed, is gradually taking on the atmosphere of a discotheque at an airport hotel. T-minus five minutes to polls from Ontario\u2026 Former Al Jazeera journalist Mohamed Fadel Fahmy, imprisoned for more than 400 days in Egypt, has made a triumphant return to the polls. It\u2019s nearly too late for Liberal leader Justin Trudeau to convince any Canadians to cast their vote left, but noted Canadian actor and frenemy of the Guardian William Shatner has advice for the politician nonetheless. Update from Canada\u2019s official results page: Liberals are leading in all 33 reporting ridings so far, with 60.5% of the vote. Conservatives have 17.8% and NDP has 17.3%, and the Blue Jays have more runs after two innings than either party has seats in Atlantic Canada. \u201cFirst-past-the-post is a momentum play,\u201d former Liberal leader Bob Rae told John Barber for the Guardian, just prior to the current campaign. And momentum so far strongly suggests Canada is heading toward a Liberal majority government. Polls close in Ontario at 9.30pm ET, as well as in the whole of Eastern, Central and Mountain time zones, meaning the election\u2019s dynamic could change dramatically when the city ridings start reporting votes. Baseball break: the Toronto Blue Jays \u2013 a team with three Canadian ballplayers \u2013 are winning 3-1, top of the third, over the Kansas City Royals. No word on whether those players voted, though, or if they did for whom, but the team\u2019s got a \u201ccome together\u201d motto\u2026 so they must be supporting some kind of minority government? Or maybe just sports. One party\u2019s gain is another party\u2019s menacing red wave of doom. Atlantic red tide notwithstanding, though, pollsters have yet to register a huge number of votes from Canada\u2019s major cities \u2013 regions like Quebec and greater Toronto, where the three parties have fought hardest over densely populated ridings. Notwithstanding that notwithstanding caveat, conservatives are not pleased. Former justice minister Peter MacKay told CTV News: \u201cThese are not the results we were hoping for in Atlantic Canada.\u201d \u201cTonight\u2019s election could point directly to a minority government \u2013 likely Liberal, possibly Conservative,\u201d writes Jessica Murphy from Montreal, even as some bold pundits hazard a Liberal majority, apparently emboldened by the party\u2019s lead (for now) in 32 ridings of Atlantic Canada. Both NDP leader Tom Mulcair and Liberal leader Justin Trudeau said during the campaign they would not work with a re-elected Prime Minister Stephen Harper. In Mulcair\u2019s words \u201cthere isn\u2019t a snowball\u2019s chance in hell.\u201d Her take as we wait for polls from outside Atlantic Canada. If the Liberals win a minority\u2026 \u201cTrudeau has ruled out a formal coalition,\u201d Bruce Ryder, with York University\u2019s Osgoode Hall Law School in Toronto, told the Guardian. \u201cIt does suggest the most likely scenario is Trudeau is likely to govern the way Harper did in the first minority, 2007-2008, where he sought to get support for various initiatives and votes from the opposition parties on a case-by-case basis.\u201d If Conservatives manage a minority\u2026 Things could get more interesting \u2013 and more complicated. Ryder laid out some possible scenarios: \u201cI would imagine (Harper) doing something like putting together a Speech from the Throne that acknowledges that they didn\u2019t receive an overwhelming mandate and recognizes some key elements of the platform the Liberals and the NDP that are incorporated into the Throne speech. In other words, I would imagine they would have a Throne speech that\u2019s not over partisan to make it difficult for the NDP and the Liberals to vote him down right away.\u201d (A speech from the Throne lays out a government\u2019s broad legislative agenda and goals under Canada\u2019s political system.) If the Liberals and NDP follow through on their threat to not support Harper and he loses the confidence of the House, then Ryder said Harper has a couple of options. He could resign and Canadian Governor General David Johnston would likely approach the leader of the official opposition to see whether he could form a government. Harper can go to the Governor General and request a dissolution of parliament which would mean another election. (The Governor General is the Queen\u2019s official representative in Canada and performs the same constitutional role at the Queen does in the United Kingdom.) Either way, Canada\u2019s longest election in modern history might keep generating headlines long after the ballots are counted. The clock is ticking down on polls in western Canada, and for pollsters to tally up what votes they have, meaning the candidates have a few more hours to mull the major issues of the election: discontent and immigration. Nicky Woolf and Jessica Murphy have tackled the first, asking whether enough sentiment has built up against Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper to oust him from office in favor of a progressive government \u2013 of some unknown composition. And John Barber writes on the continuing debate over immigration \u2013 and the surprising debate over veils and citizenship \u2013 that dominated the latter portions of the campaign, especially in the Toronto suburbs. \u201cA Liberal landslide is taking shape in Atlantic Canada,\u201d writes John Barber for the Guardian in Toronto, although the region is historically left-leaning and the vast bulk of votes from Canada\u2019s urban centers have yet to be counted. The party has captured more than 85% of the votes counted so far and elected or leading in all 18 districts that have reported. Gains expected here, but this is something else again. The Conservatives have captured less than 5% of the vote in Atlantic Canada and appear to have lost all eight seats they held here before dissolution \u2013 what would be a stunning setback. Will the Liberal lead survive in NDP heartland? Stay tuned! Per the official results page: Liberals are leading in 26 electoral districts, Conservatives in two, the NDP in one. (A party needs 170 for a majority.) The Toronto Star\u2019s Alex Boutilier says Liberals should be feeling good about Newfoundland and Nova Scotia. Which ridings could change the race? Jessica Murphy has the key battles that have been fiercer \u2013 and could be more consequential \u2013 than most of the 332 others. Greater Toronto \u201cThe definition of vote-rich,\u201d she writes. \u201cOntario has 35% of Canada\u2019s seats and many of them are in and around the country\u2019s largest city. \u201c Ajax: The incumbent here is Immigration Minister Chris Alexander. His main challenger is Liberal Mark Holland, a former MP who has been gunning hard to win back his seat. The Syrian refugee crisis \u2013 and the perception the Conservatives fumbled their handling of the issue during the campaign - may have given Holland the ammunition he needed. Eglinton-Lawrence: Another Conservative cabinet minister - Finance Minister Joe Oliver - is facing stiff competition from Liberal candidate Marco Mendicino. Mendicino fought hard just to win the nomination in this riding after Conservative-turned-Liberal MP Eve Adams made a play to carry the Liberal banner here. Oliver was largely absent from the public eye during the campaign \u2013 even as Canada dipped briefly into recession \u2013 as he focused on keeping his seat. Quebec \u201cQuebec was supposed to stay NDP orange this election. Still, as the party fell in the polls, many ridings became three, even four way races between the Liberals, the Conservatives, the NDP and the Bloc Quebecois.\u201d Laurier Sainte Marie: The incumbent in this downtown Montreal riding is New Democrat MP Helene Laverdiere, who stole this from Bloc Quebecois leader Gilles Duceppe in 2011. Duceppe quit politics but came back to lead the faltering Bloc shortly before this campaign began. Bets are lining up behind Laverdiere managing to hold on and defeat the Bloc leader twice in a row. Mount Royal: This Montreal riding was a safe Liberal seat for years under popular - and widely respected across the aisles - MP Irwin Cotler. Cotler has resigned and the Conservatives, who have had their eye on this seat for ages, are running star candidate Robert Libman, a well-known provincial and municipal politician. Conservative leader Stephen Harper even launched his campaign in this riding back in August. The Liberals are running Anthony Housefather, another popular local politician, and it looks like this riding will stay red. Outremont: New Democrat leader Tom Mulcair won this riding in 2008, establishing a beachhead for the party in Quebec which culminated in the \u201cOrange Wave\u201d that swept the province in 2011. Now, this safe seat is under threat as the party\u2019s fortunes took a tumble in polls and with the Liberals looking like they\u2019ll make gains on the island of Montreal. Mulcair\u2019s Liberal challenger is lawyer Rachel Bendayan. British Columbia \u201cCanada\u2019s westernmost province is three hours behind the most populated provinces of Canada (Ontario and Quebec) where elections are often decided. But in this election the province is considered a battleground.\u201d North Vancouver: The incumbent Conservative is Andrew Saxton.. Liberal leader Justin Trudeau held a massive rally in this riding as he capped off his campaign, and it\u2019s predicted to turn to the Liberals. As the first polls close, the very first counts are coming in, from Newfoundland, and Liberal Yvonne Jones leading in Labrador \u2026 with 81 polls pending there. On CBC a pundit says \u201cwe gotta be careful\u201d because \u201cNewfoundland doesn\u2019t necessarily set the trend.\u201d The polite disagreement rages on. And so the long night of counting begins still without anything from either of Canada\u2019s leading pop stars, though Drake may be getting ready for the Jays game. Green leader Elizabeth May isn\u2019t overly concerned about her own party\u2019s prospects in the election as she finishes up campaigning on the trail, per the Globe and Mail\u2019s Justine Hunter. Following Stephen Harper\u2019s rise and support of acts like an end to absentee ballots has prompted progressive activists to plan \u201cstrategic\u201d action, says John Barber, writing for the Guardian from Toronto. This was an election in which activists forcefully urged progressive Canadians to vote \u201cstrategically\u201d to prevent Conservative candidates from winning seats in districts where competing progressives threatened to divide the anti-Conservative vote. The advice was to back whichever local candidate looked most likely to defeat their Conservative rival, even if that meant Liberals voting for the NDP and NDPers voting Liberal. Groups such as leadnow.ca devoted considerable resources to the job of identifying districts where strategic voting might work and advising electors how to do it. A hard sell in any event, strategic voting became moot as the campaign closed, with polls showing progressive voters flocking en masse into the Liberal camp and Justin Trudeau emerging as the main challenger to the unpopular incumbent. Virtually all of Trudeau\u2019s newfound support appears to have come from voters abandoning Tom Mulcair\u2019s once-leading NDP \u2013 a traditional source of support for Liberal candidates when the crunch comes. Don\u2019t feel that the Conservatives, Liberals or NDP quite match your politics? Fear not, Canada likely has the political party for you. Nearly two dozen political parties have put forth contenders in ridings across Canada, including the Radical Marijuana party (tubular drug policy), the Pirate party (swashbuckling for intellectual property reform) , the Marxist-Leninists (workers of the world, etc), the Alliance of the North (and xenophobia) and the Animal Alliance (campaigning for bear and suffrage since 2005) And then there\u2019s the Rhinoceros Party, whose leaders promise to move Canada\u2019s capital to Kapuskasing, Ontario, to nationalize Tim Hortons, and to give Canadians \u201ca monthly orgasm\u201d. Groups under the Rhinocerous banner have run satirical campaigns since the 1960s, and they have 27 candidates running this season. From the Globe and Mail: It won\u2019t happen, of course. Even Mr. Lukawski, a 22-year-old computer software developer, admits his party won\u2019t win a seat. If he comes in higher than dead last in Ottawa Centre it will be a victory. It doesn\u2019t really matter, of course, as the most important Rhino election promise of all is that they will never keep their promises. What does matter is that this election, the longest in Canadian history since 1874, is also the most humourless election since Confederation. \u201cIt\u2019s tragic, really,\u201d says the candidate. \u201cI\u2019m not sure elections are supposed to be fun \u2013 but there should be a few laughs.\u201d So while the race has been billed as a battle between three parties \u2013 the reigning Conservatives, who would keep Stephen Harper on the maple-leaf throne, the New Democratic Party, a progressive set led by longtime MP Thomas Mulcair, and the Liberals, the resurgent center-left party led by Justin Trudeau \u2013 you can really take your pick. An unlikely sight south of the border. Down here you\u2019re lucky if you get a sticker. As Canadians know, the polls will begin to close on the east coast in just over an hour while on the west coast, polls will remain open for several more hours. Respectively, in the Eastern time zone, polls close at 9.30pm; in Newfoundland, Atlantic and Central at 8.30pm; in Mountain and Saskatchewan 7.30pm; and in Pacific, 7pm. So with that final update, I\u2019m handing the liveblog over to my colleague Alan Yuhas, who will finish out the last leg of this marathon election cycle. He\u2019s well caffeinated and will likely make far fewer references to Bieber than I have. We hope you stay tuned throughout the night for more coverage of what has been billed as one of the closest elections in history. Update: still nothing from the Biebs. A sneak peek at the Conservative and Liberal party headquarters. The Guardian\u2019s deputy features editor and Canadian expat Ruth Spencer is among the 1.4 million Canadians who were stripped of their right to vote. I lost my right to participate in Canada\u2019s democratic system last summer, when the Appeals Court of Ontario sided with the Harper government and ruled that Canadians who have lived outside the country for more than five years should be banned from voting. Their reasoning was that permitting all non-resident citizens to vote would allow us \u201cto participate in making laws that affect Canadian residents on a daily basis, but have little to no practical consequence for their own daily lives\u201d. To say that what happens in Canada does not affect the \u201cdaily lives\u201d of someone like me is, to be blunt, a load of bull \u2013 and a superficial, naive understanding of the life of an expat. Read Ruth\u2019s piece in full here. It\u2019s a time-worn clich\u00e9: an intrepid young journalist in hot pursuit of a breaking news story lands in a new city only to be set straight by his fast-talking, city-wise cab driver. Well, that\u2019s basically what happened to our reporter Nicky Woolf when he arrived in Calgary on Monday afternoon. By luck, the cab taking me from Calgary airport to the convention centre where prime minister Stephen Harper will be hosting an election night party was driven by 58-year-old Mizanur Rahman, a former candidate in the Calgary provincial election back in May. Six months ago, Rahman, who moved to Canada nearly three decades ago from Bangladesh, was an NDP candidate for Calgary West. But since then, he told me, his support has swung over to Harper\u2019s Conservatives. \u201cWe will be better off under Conservatives,\u201d Rahman said. \u201cIn order to be better off, [we need] to have a balanced budget.\u201d He said that another issue which had brought him to the Conservative fold was marijuana - which both the Liberals and the NDP have said they want to decriminalise or legalise. \u201cI think Mr. Harper is right,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has a very long political view. [Marijuana] is actually very harmful for the younger generation.\u201d But most important to him, he said, was jobs. \u201cThe NDP is not a balanced approach for making money. They approach corporations as the enemy, but they are part of our society. Jobs are important.\u201d He said if the NDP were in power there would be a \u201chuman disaster.\u201d Asked whether the Conservatives\u2019 hard-line approach to immigrants bothered him at all, Rahman said it did not. \u201cWe need to have security in our country,\u201d he said. Rahman has already voted \u2013 he voted early \u2013 and he voted for the Conservatives. As we mentioned, Canada\u2019s most famous native son, Justin Bieber, has been quiet about the election. Perhaps he forgot. Or maybe he just isn\u2019t interested in sharing his political views with his 68.5 million Twitter fans. And with twice as many followers as Canada has citizens, perhaps that\u2019s for the best. Here\u2019s what other famous Canadians are saying about the election. Canadian-American actress Pamela Anderson has said she wouldn\u2019t vote for Conservative Leader Stephen Harper. Anderson cannot vote because she has lived outside of Canada for more than five years. Famous Canadian hockey player Wayne Gretzky cannot vote either, but nonetheless endorsed Harper. On HBO\u2019s Last Week Tonight, Mike Myers joined John Oliver in encouraging Canadians not to vote for Harper. Esteemed Canadian actor Donald Sutherland has urged Canadian who can vote to \u201ckick out\u201d Harper. He\u2019d take New Democratic Party leader Tom Mulcair or \u201cTrudeau\u2019s son\u201d liberal leader Justin Trudeau \u2013 anyone but Harper, really. Sutherland has joined forces with other Canadian expatriates stripped of their right to vote to call for changes to the residency limits set by Canada\u2019s voting law. As for the others \u2013 Drake, Avril Lavigne, Celine Dion, Ryan Gosling? Crickets. It\u2019s so far been a relatively quiet day of voting in Canada with the real drama expected after the sun sets. With several hours yet until polls close, the race is still very much a close call. Will he or won\u2019t he? Harper says he feels confident after leaving a voting booth in Calgary but polls have the Liberals tipped to win. John Oliver doesn\u2019t want you to vote for Stephen Harper \u2013 and he\u2019s not going to jail for saying it. Some Canadians are voting wearing Halloween masks and helmets to protest a rule allowing Muslim women to vote wearing a veil. In another nail-biting Canadian contest, the Toronto Blue Jays play the Kansas City Royals for Game Three of the American League Championship Series. The Blue Jays have asked Canadians to vote before tuning in to watch the game. Justin Bieber has still not said a peep about #elexn42. Mali Ilse Paquin files this dispatch from Montreal To protest election rules that allow Muslim women to wear a veil while voting, some Canadians have gone to polling booths wearing scarves, halloween masks and balaclava helmets. More than 10,000 Facebook users have joined a group called \u201cOn October 19, I will vote veiled\u201d which was founded by a Quebec woman called Martine Leclerc. She said she was prompted to start the page by a row over the federal court ruling that cleared the way for Zunera Ishaq to wear her niqab while taking the Canadian citizenship oath. One poll in March showed that 82% of Canadians agreed with the government on the attempted niqab ban. But the proportion reached 93% in the Francophone province of Quebec where tensions over religious minorities\u2019 rights have run high in the last decade. Leclerc, who lives in Montreal, said she first considered voting with her face covered in protest of Zunera Ishaq\u2019s legal victory. \u201cIt didn\u2019t make sense to me for voters to be able to hide their face on religious grounds\u201d, she told the Guardian. \u201cOur democratic right to vote should be executed under secular rules.\u201d Under current guidelines, in place since 2007, voters do not have to uncover their faces if they show two valid identity cards and take an oath that they are eligible. Women and men alike, most of them from Quebec, have followed Leclerc\u2019s initiative, casting their votes in Halloween costumes, wrestling masks or scarves. One of the first women to do so was shown masked with a potato sack in a Quebec City polling station. Montreal-born Marie-\u00c9laine Boucher, who was wearing a skull-patterned scarf, claimed to have received high-fives from other voters after casting her ballot. \u201cI think religious signs have no place in the public sphere\u201d, said the schoolteacher. \u201cI view the niqab as a symbol of non-integration to our society.\u201d Leclerc said her group was not intended to be anti-Muslim, but many comments on the page included defamatory remarks about Ishaq. \u201cI try to remind people that we are not targeting Zunera Ishaq or Muslims in general,\u201d said Leclerc. \u201cThe problem is our laws that do not reflect our secular values.\u201d Andrew Coyne, one of Canada\u2019s most prominent conservative journalists, resigned as head of the National Post editorial board today, citing a \u201cprofessional disagreement\u201d with newspaper executives - though he remains as a columnist. The Post - founded by Conrad Black in 1998 - is the flagship paper of the Postmedia chain. In a series of 15 tweets, Coyne laid out the disagreement he had with Postmedia executives over a column he wrote dissenting from his paper\u2019s endorsement of the Conservatives \u2013 and whether the column \u201cconfused readers and embarrassed the paper\u201d. Coyne said that while he respected the right of the owners and managers to set the editorial line, his \u201cconcerns were and are merely a) that there should be no suggestion that I was personally endorsing or voting for the Conservatives\u201d and \u201c that I could not do my job as a columnist if I was obliged to stay silent where these conflicted with those of management.\u201d He noted he would be voting for the New Democrat candidate in his riding and then finished with this mic drop: On Twitter, Green Party leader Elizabeth May praised Coyne for taking a stand against \u201cincreasingly controlled corporate media.\u201d Postmedia is the largest publisher by circulation of English-language daily papers in Canada. It owns the Post along with 17 other major papers across the country and many more regional holdings. In some cities like Ottawa, Canada\u2019s capital, it owns more than one major daily, the Ottawa Citizen and the Ottawa Sun. Here\u2019s an example of the Postmedia endorsement that appeared in the Calgary Sun on 9 October, variations of which ran in many of their holdings: \u201cIf, as some polls suggest, this election is coming down to voters making an economic choice between Stephen Harper\u2019s Conservatives and Justin Trudeau\u2019s Liberals, then the choice is clear. \u201cHarper\u2019s plan is balanced budgets with small surpluses for the next four years. Trudeau is to plunge us back into three years of deficits.\u201d The chain endorsement, along with the full front page Conservative Party ads that ran in their papers Friday, has raised questions about media ownership in Canada. CBC has the poll closing times by region. Karma gets complicated when a federal election collides with a crucial playoff game for the Toronto Blue Jays. The baseball team recently fell two games behind the Kansas City Royals in the American League championship series and will be fighting for their lives in a must-watch game as Canadians line up to vote this evening. Millions of win-starved Canadian baseball fans are already annoyed with politics, having not failed to notice that their only major-league baseball team has lost every time one of the three federal leaders attended a game this fall in search of feel-good screen time. A repeat hex tonight would see the Jays falling three games behind the Royals in the best-of-seven series, effectively ending their hopes of contending for their first World Series title since 1993. Others are more confident, noting that the current election is the first to be held in October since that same year, 1993, when attention was likewise divided and the Jays went on to win it all. For their part, the Blue Jays really want Canadians to vote before tuning in to watch the game. Looking for a lunchtime read? Let me recommend Stephen Harper: master manipulator by journalist Nick Davies. The article revisits the scandals that have dogged Harper over the course of 11 years in power and three federal elections. In Canada, some of the prime minister\u2019s men and women have been accused not simply of cheating to win elections but of conspiring to jam the machinery of democratic government. Some of these allegations have been proved. In the 11 years since he became leader of the country\u2019s Conservatives, the party has been fined for breaking electoral rules, and various members of Team Harper have been caught misleading parliament, gagging civil servants, subverting parliamentary committees, gagging scientists, harassing the supreme court, gagging diplomats, lying to the public, concealing evidence of potential crime, spying on opponents, bullying and smearing. Harper personally has earned himself the rare rebuke of being found to be in contempt of his parliament. After casting his ballot, Stephen Harper told reporters: \u201cIt\u2019s a nice blue sky. That\u2019s how I\u2019m feeling.\u201d But it\u2019s not all blue skies and rainbows for the prime minister looking to clinch a fourth election on Monday, say the polls. Harper is struggling to hold on to power in the face of a challenge by Justin Trudeau\u2019s Liberal party. Read more here. Fancy that photograph of liberal leader Justin Trudeau making a cheerleader pyramid with his campaign staff after arriving Montreal to vote on Monday? Here\u2019s the video. Update: John Oliver will not go to jail or be fined C$5,000 for telling Canadians not to elect Stephen Harper. According to the Canadian Press, the Canadian elections authorities said on Monday that the law Oliver dared to defy does not actually bar foreigners from expressing an opinion. The expression of personal political views by Canadians or non-Canadians as to which parties or candidates they support is not an offence under the Act,\u201d said Elections Canada spokesman John Enright. \u201cThis also applies to Mr Oliver.\u201d Enright also told the news agency that the provision Oliver mentions refers to people who \u201cinduce\u201d Canadians: \u201cTo induce there must be a tangible thing offered. A personal view is not inducement.\u201d A Calgary woman penned an open letter to prime minister Stephen Harper to explain why she will not vote for the Conservative party on Monday, even though she says her family is the \u201cpicture\u201d of the Canadians who benefit most under his economic policies. In the letter, posted on Facebook on 10 October, Mary Cleaver writes: You\u2019ve underestimated us. On October 19, we\u2019re not voting for our bank balance. We\u2019re voting for change because we want the caring Canada of our youth back. The Canada that supported our single mothers that gave us the opportunity to succeed in the first place. The election as told through campaign ads Campaign ads are a key part of any election and Canada\u2019s #elxn42, as it has come to be known on Twitter, is no exception. Ads showcase the key message a party wants the electorate to hear and are also a chance for campaign teams to flex creative muscles. The Conservatives have built a reputation on taking down successive Liberal leaders with cleverly crafted attack ads with taglines that stick. For former leader Michael Ignatieff, who spent years outside of Canada, it was \u201che didn\u2019t come back for you\u201d. Soon after Liberal leader Justin Trudeau won his leadership bid, Canadian television aired ads with the tagline \u201cjust not ready\u201d. The attacks may not stick this time around, but most Canadians likely have this particular ad memorized. This Liberal response ad was considered bad tactics because Trudeau is repeating the Conservative attack line \u2013 usually a no-no for candidates. But this ad broke with convention and is seen as a success. Trailing in the polls, the New Democrats grasped onto the resignation of the Liberal volunteer campaign co-chair in the final week of the race over an email he sent to energy infrastructure TransCanada explaining how to lobby the next government. His actions don\u2019t appear to have broken any rules but it was a definite political blunder. The New Democrat war room was quick to pivot on the controversy. Party ads weren\u2019t the only ones to stand out. An independent candidate from British Columbia made headlines with this wild video. And during his nomination fight Liberal candidate Ron Planche released a pitch that has been dubbed by some the worst campaign ad in history. The separatist Bloc Quebecois \u2013 seeking electoral salvation after getting nearly wiped out in the largely French-speaking province of Quebec in the 2011 election \u2013 were first to raise the issue of niqabs in Canada\u2019s election. This ad is in French, but the visuals tell most of the story. Called \u201cA drop too far\u201d, it warns Quebecers that NDP leader Tom Mulcair isn\u2019t onside with the province\u2019s voters over either the niqab or the proposed Energy East pipeline, which would carry Alberta oil through Quebec. The woman at the center of the \u2018niqab issue\u2019 Earlier this year, Zunera Ishaq told the Guardian that her choice to wear a veil in public is a \u201ctrivial and minor issue\u201d. But for 35 million Canadians, Ishaq\u2019s insistence that she has a right to conceal her face has become a central issue in the ongoing election campaign, giving a late boost to a Conservative government that had previously seemed doomed to defeat. The debate over whether women should be allowed to wear the full face veil at a citizenship ceremony became a wedge issue for both the Bloc Quebecois and for the Conservatives. The New Democrats, whose power base is in the province, saw their support fall in part over their disagreement with both the Conservatives and the Bloc over the niqab, which they felt a woman should be allowed to wear. Read more here. John Barber in Toronto sends this dispatch: The Canadian and international media spent a lot of time during this long campaign talking about the rights of Muslim women and the limits of multiculturalism \u2013 the so-called \u201cniqab issue\u201d, spurred by the Conservative government\u2019s determination to make one Muslim immigrant from Pakistan remove her face veil before swearing allegiance to her new country. Judging by spilled ink alone, a person would be forgiven for seeing this as the \u201cniqab election\u201d. But despite the fervor, the issue appears to have had little if any impact on actual voting intentions. Broad trends charted by hundreds of polls show that Stephen Harper\u2019s Conservatives began and ended the campaign with the same 30% support \u2013 neither rising nor falling as a result of their provocative stance against immigrant Zunera Ishaq. Outside a few ridings in rural Quebec, the niqab issue looks to be dead on arrival at election day. Follow John on twitter @annegonian Maclean\u2019s, Canada\u2019s national weekly news magazine, has pinpointed three make or break moments that defined Canada\u2019s marathon election campaign. Deciding on what constitutes the turning point is something of a parlour game for political watchers, and it can be debated endlessly. Was it the moment when Justin Trudeau defended his father during the Munk debate on foreign policy, as the Ottawa Citizen\u2019s Mark Kennedy told me recently? Was it Tom Mulcair\u2019s stance on the divisive niqab debate, which put him off side with much of his key vote in Quebec but was hailed as an act of integrity by his supporters? Was it Stephen Harper\u2019s launching of the barbaric cultural practice\u2019s hot line, a paranoid stunt that solidified his turn toward the dark politics of division or was it his income-splitting promise, which could drive middle-class voters to him? Read about the turning points here. Guess who they voted for? Hey Americans. Yeah, we\u2019re talking to you. If you\u2019ve been too wrapped up the Donald Trump show to notice the electoral drama unfolding just north of the border, my colleague Nicky Woolf has a nice little piece on why Americans should care about Canada\u2019s nail-bitingly close election. This is especially important for those among you who plan to move there should the US presidential election not go as you hoped. With Liberal leader Justin Trudeau\u2019s party predicted to win the most seats \u2013 if not an outright majority \u2013 experts say there is a chance of a thaw in relations between the two countries in time to facilitate real action on issues like climate change. Of course, the US and Canada are deeply intertwined economically. Each is the other\u2019s largest trading partner: trade between the two countries in 2012 \u2013 the most recent year for which data is available from the Office of the United States Trade Representative \u2013 totalled $707bn. Canada is also the world\u2019s largest national importer of US goods, spending $51bn a year on US-made cars alone. It is also the second-largest importer of US agricultural products ... \u201cFor our American cousins, the relationship is consequential. For us, it has often been definitional,\u201d Trudeau said earlier this year. Read more here. While millions of Canadians are heading to the polls today, roughly 1.4 million won\u2019t have a say. Under a law upheld by an appeals court last July, Canadians who are old enough to vote and have lived abroad for five or more years cannot vote are barred from voting in Canadian federal elections. The Guardian\u2019s Canadian expats, Ruth Spencer and Laurence Mathieu-L\u00e9ger, spoke to disenfranchised Canadians living in New York City at a demonstration against prime minister Stephen Harper in Brooklyn last week. People like me have no other citizenship. I have no right to vote anywhere. \u2013 Gillian Frank When elections roll around, editorial boards like to have their say. BuzzFeed Canada\u2019s has spoken. With cheeky puns and firm judgement, the website has endorsed Toronto Blue Jays right fielder Jose Bautista\u2019s \u201cdamn fine booty\u201d. The endorsement is apparently catching fire. Who\u2019s Stephen Harper? What are Canada\u2019s political parties? What\u2019s a riding? Who\u2019s in the lead? Here\u2019s everything you need to know to understand today\u2019s election, thank to my colleague Alberto Nardelli. While non-citizens dare not try to influence the Canadian election, these front pages can. In a final push ahead of Monday\u2019s election, The Ottawa Citizen, The Vancouver Sun, Fort McMurray Today, among other newspapers, replaced their front pages with near-full-page spreads endorsing the Tories, The Huffington Post reports. The spreads said either \u201cVoting Liberal will cost you,\u201d or \u201cVoting NDP or Liberal will cost you,\u201d followed by explanations of how those parties\u2019 platforms would affect voters. There was also a ballot-style checkbox marking a \u201cConservative\u201d vote. Last Week Tonight host John Oliver wants the Canadian people to vote prime minister Stephen Harper out of office. But saying so could land him behind bars. Under Canadian election law, it\u2019s illegal for non-citizens to try to influence a Canadian election \u2013 a violation punishable by a $5,000 fine or jail time, or both. But Oliver said he wasn\u2019t scared of spending six months in a Canadian jail. \u201cIf telling you not to vote for Stephen Harper is going to cost me $5,000, I\u2019m going to get my money\u2019s worth and do it in the most Canadian way possible,\u201d Oliver promised. On stage, Oliver was joined by a beaver wearing a maple leaf shirt playing Sweet Caroline on a keyboard, a moose getting a colonoscopy under Canada\u2019s \u201cfantastic single-payer health care system\u201d, and native son Mike Myers dressed as a mountie driving a snowplow, who declares: \u201cDon\u2019t vote for Stephen Harper.\u201d The scene ends with Oliver declaring that Stephen Harper doesn\u2019t care about black people, a reference to the moment 10 years ago when Kanye West, standing next to Myers, said on national TV: \u201cGeorge Bush doesn\u2019t care about black people,\u201d during a benefit concert for Katrina victims. \u201cOh God, not again,\u201d Myers groans. Oliver corrects himself. \u201cStephen Harper doesn\u2019t care about Muslim people.\u201d Myers: \u201cTotally fair.\u201d Oliver flings Canadian dollars at the screen and they all dance. Oh Canada. Canadians head to the polls today for what seems set to be the closest election in the country\u2019s history following a marathon campaign cycle. Just in the last three weeks the centre-left Liberal party, led by Justin Trudeau \u2013 son of famous former prime minister Pierre Trudeau \u2013 has surged into the lead, while the one-time pole position-holders, the left-wing New Democratic Party (NDP), led by Tom Mulcair, have dropped to third place. Barring a surprise in today\u2019s result - and after the polling upset in the UK election earlier this year introduced the world to the concept of \u201cshy Tories\u201d, one is not entirely out of the question \u2013 Trudeau looks set to oust incumbent prime minister Stephen Harper and his Conservative party from power. The Liberals may be leading, but current projections suggest that they will not be able to win the 170 seats required for a parliamentary majority on their own. There have been hints throughout the campaign that the NDP may be willing to enter into a coalition with the Liberals, but no outright promises; and a minority government, where legislation is negotiated on an ad hoc basis, is also a potential outcome. Places to watch: ridings \u2013 electoral districts \u2013 in downtown Toronto and Vancouver, many of which are Liberal/NDP marginal seats, will indicate how united the support is behind the centrist Liberals, and act as good bellwethers. In the greater Toronto area, suburban seats like Ajax, where the conservatives wiped the Liberals out in 2011, will show how much support Harper has lost to the Liberals among his base; the Conservative incumbent, immigration minister Chris Alexander, looks set to be ousted by the Liberal MP Alexander toppled in 2011, Mark Holland. Meanwhile the oil-rich province of Alberta, where Harper is himself an MP, will be useful for seeing if the NDP can maintain the anti-Conservative sentiment which saw them win provincial power here in a sensational revolt against Harper\u2019s party back in May. Polling has been staggered across Canada\u2019s timezones in the hope that a result might be available at roughly the same time. Polls opened at 9.30am eastern time in Ontario, and an hour later in British Columbia, on the west coast (7.30am local time). Results will start pouring in pretty quickly after the polls close, at 9.30pm eastern in Ontario and 10.30pm eastern in British Columbia. Stay with us \u2013 it could be a bumpy ride.",

          "body": "<p>Friendly old Canada, left for dead after nine years of stern rule under the divisive government of the Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper, has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/20/justin-trudeau-set-to-become-pm-as-liberals-sweep-board-in-canada-election\">returned with a vengeance</a> after voters overwhelmingly turned to a charismatic Liberal named Trudeau in a bid to recapture the glory days that characterized his father\u2019s long and memorable rule.<br></p> <p>\u201cSunny ways!\u201d a hoarse Justin Trudeau exulted as he accepted his striking victory in Canada\u2019s 42nd general election. \u201cThis is what positive politics can do.\u201d</p> <p>The Liberal party\u2019s resounding victory proved that \u201ca positive, optimistic, hopeful vision of public life isn\u2019t a naive dream\u201d, said Trudeau. \u201cIt can be a powerful force for change.\u201d</p> <p>Once mercilessly derided as \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/31/canada-liberal-party-justin-trudeau-interview-election\">just not ready</a>\u201d for the job in persistent Conservative attacks ads, the former drama teacher performed flawlessly throughout the campaign, demonstrating a true populist ease with voters while his party posted videos of the handsome leader sparring with his shirt off or paddling a canoe on a misty river in the manner of his father, the former Canadian prime minister Pierre Trudeau.</p> <p>Over the course of a 78-day campaign, Trudeau led his party from last place in the polls to a resounding victory, winning 184 seats in the 338-seat House of Commons, according to unofficial results, and the right to form a majority government. </p> <p>Equally impressive, he won the victory four years after the former Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff suffered the worst defeat in party history. That loss led many to question whether the centrist Liberals could even survive as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/07/tom-mulcair-and-canadas-progressive-democrats-lead-push-for-change\">leftwing New Democratic party</a> rose to fill the vacant space as the official party of opposition.</p> <p>For a campaign that remained relentlessly upbeat and scornful of what Trudeau called \u201cthe politics of fear and division\u201d, the result was exceptionally bloody.</p> <p>It was the NDP that suffered most at Trudeau\u2019s hands. The party that entered the campaign leading the polls ended it by losing all but 42 of the 95 seats it held in the last parliament, returning to its traditional third-party status. </p> <p>The Conservative party avoided a similar collapse, retaining more than 100 seats and its dominance in western Canada, but Harper likewise stood down from his party\u2019s leadership. The outgoing prime minister seemed uncharacteristically relaxed and happy as he relinquished power in the face of what he called \u201ca result we accept without hesitation\u201d. But he didn\u2019t actually use the word \u201cresignation\u201d once in his concession speech \u2013 the announcement was left to a statement from his party which was circulated to reporters.</p> <p> The election\u2019s unambiguous outcome did forestall widespread concerns that a closer result could have pitched Canada into a constitutional crisis as various parties wrestled for control of parliament. In the event, the Liberals will enjoy ample time to form a government without the need to seek partners \u2013 or even the slightest fear of effective opposition from its suddenly leaderless rivals.</p> <p>The new Canadian leader\u2019s easiest job will be showing the world that Canada has returned to its traditional role of international boy scout, abjuring the hard-right, militaristic and climate-denying record of the Harper government. In that, he will be helped by the fact that the previous government \u2013 despite its own rhetoric and that of its enemies \u2013 never completely abandoned the role.</p> <p>Canadians and international observers can expect a sharp change in tone if not policy with respect to refugees and Canada\u2019s involvement in the Middle East.

          "bodyText": "Friendly old Canada, left for dead after nine years of stern rule under the divisive government of the Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper, has returned with a vengeance after voters overwhelmingly turned to a charismatic Liberal named Trudeau in a bid to recapture the glory days that characterized his father\u2019s long and memorable rule. \u201cSunny ways!\u201d a hoarse Justin Trudeau exulted as he accepted his striking victory in Canada\u2019s 42nd general election. \u201cThis is what positive politics can do.\u201d The Liberal party\u2019s resounding victory proved that \u201ca positive, optimistic, hopeful vision of public life isn\u2019t a naive dream\u201d, said Trudeau. \u201cIt can be a powerful force for change.\u201d Once mercilessly derided as \u201cjust not ready\u201d for the job in persistent Conservative attacks ads, the former drama teacher performed flawlessly throughout the campaign, demonstrating a true populist ease with voters while his party posted videos of the handsome leader sparring with his shirt off or paddling a canoe on a misty river in the manner of his father, the former Canadian prime minister Pierre Trudeau. Over the course of a 78-day campaign, Trudeau led his party from last place in the polls to a resounding victory, winning 184 seats in the 338-seat House of Commons, according to unofficial results, and the right to form a majority government. Equally impressive, he won the victory four years after the former Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff suffered the worst defeat in party history. That loss led many to question whether the centrist Liberals could even survive as the leftwing New Democratic party rose to fill the vacant space as the official party of opposition. For a campaign that remained relentlessly upbeat and scornful of what Trudeau called \u201cthe politics of fear and division\u201d, the result was exceptionally bloody. It was the NDP that suffered most at Trudeau\u2019s hands. The party that entered the campaign leading the polls ended it by losing all but 42 of the 95 seats it held in the last parliament, returning to its traditional third-party status. The Conservative party avoided a similar collapse, retaining more than 100 seats and its dominance in western Canada, but Harper likewise stood down from his party\u2019s leadership. The outgoing prime minister seemed uncharacteristically relaxed and happy as he relinquished power in the face of what he called \u201ca result we accept without hesitation\u201d. But he didn\u2019t actually use the word \u201cresignation\u201d once in his concession speech \u2013 the announcement was left to a statement from his party which was circulated to reporters. The election\u2019s unambiguous outcome did forestall widespread concerns that a closer result could have pitched Canada into a constitutional crisis as various parties wrestled for control of parliament. In the event, the Liberals will enjoy ample time to form a government without the need to seek partners \u2013 or even the slightest fear of effective opposition from its suddenly leaderless rivals. The new Canadian leader\u2019s easiest job will be showing the world that Canada has returned to its traditional role of international boy scout, abjuring the hard-right, militaristic and climate-denying record of the Harper government. In that, he will be helped by the fact that the previous government \u2013 despite its own rhetoric and that of its enemies \u2013 never completely abandoned the role. Canadians and international observers can expect a sharp change in tone if not policy with respect to refugees and Canada\u2019s involvement in the Middle East. In his victory speech, Trudeau also took pains to disavow the previous government\u2019s attempts to win votes by inspiring fear of Muslim women who cover their faces. \u201cWe know thar our enviable, inclusive society didn\u2019t happen by accident, and won\u2019t continue without effort,\u201d he declared. The substance of the new leader\u2019s claims will quickly be tested on the international stage at next month\u2019s Paris climate summit, where a hastily assembled Canadian delegation will struggle to shake off the country\u2019s reputation as a laggard in the international fight against climate change. That may be more difficult than imagined, given Trudeau\u2019s consistent support for the Canadian oil industry, especially the notoriously dirty tar sands. The emerging Liberal juggernaut suffered a minor but telling setback in the final week of the campaign when its co-chairman, Dan Gagnier, was forced to resign after the leak of an email that showed him plotting with the oil industry to influence a prospective Trudeau government. During his two years in opposition, Trudeau often found himself in agreement with the Harper government, supporting both the government\u2019s law banning what it called \u201cbarbaric cultural practices\u201d as well as its sweeping anti-terrorism legislation, which has been widely condemned by civil libertarians. But Canadians were more concerned about the country\u2019s faltering economy, and Trudeau won support by promising a major program of infrastructure spending despite its effects on the government\u2019s fiscal position. With that, the Liberals neatly outflanked the formerly leftist NDP, which had promised orthodox fiscal rectitude in order to persuade Canadians of their fitness for office. But all such details were lost in the feel-good atmosphere of the overthrow, with the new prime minister promising a radical reversal of all that was \u201cnegative and divisive\u201d during his predecessor\u2019s decades-long rule. In the last days of the campaign, Harper complained that Trudeau\u2019s platform was \u201call unicorns and rainbows\u201d. But it turned out that Canadians are just fine with that. \u2022 This article was amended on 30 October 2015. An earlier version said \u201cTrudeau\u2019s winnings included the heads of both his major rivals, Conservative leader Stephen Harper, and the NDP\u2019s Tom Mulcair\u201d.

          "bodyText": "Just a few months ago, Justin Trudeau was an unlikely contender to be Canada\u2019s next prime minister. Running third in the polls, behind incumbent Stephen Harper\u2019s Conservatives and the resurgent leftwing New Democratic party, Trudeau \u2013 son of legendary prime minister Pierre Trudeau \u2013 was slated as too young (he is 43) and too inexperienced to haul his beleaguered Liberal party out of the electoral mess of the 2011 general election. That result saw the Liberal party \u2013 once the dominant force in Canadian politics \u2013 slump to third place for the first time in its history, its worst ever showing with just 34 seats. At that point, Trudeau brushed off expectations that he would succeed outgoing Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, saying: \u201cBecause of the history packaged into my name, a lot of people are turning to me in a way that \u2026 to be blunt, concerns me.\u201d His family \u2013 he has three young children aged eight and under with his wife Sophie Gr\u00e9goire \u2013 was also cited as a reason not to put himself forward. But by 2012, with other contenders falling by the wayside, the spotlight swung once again to Trudeau, and in October of that year he launched his bid with a rally in Montreal. His victory in April 2013 was almost embarrassingly comprehensive: he took over the Liberal party with 80.1% of the vote. The national polls \u2013 initially, at least \u2013 surged in his favour. But the path to government proved rather rockier. Progressive voters were tempted by Thomas Mulcair\u2019s New Democrats, while Harper\u2019s unpopular Conservative government took heart from the surprise victory \u2013 attributed to \u201cshy Tories\u201d \u2013 of David Cameron\u2019s party in the UK elections in May. Trudeau\u2019s appeal to the centre ground risked losing out to both its neighbours. What changed? Harper\u2019s tactics, referring to his challenger condescendingly as \u201cJustin\u201d and campaign ads that poked fun at his \u201cnice hair\u201d, found no grip among a section of the electorate that wanted the Conservatives out at all costs, and increasingly saw Trudeau as the best chance of achieving that. The long election campaign \u2013 the longest, in fact, since 1872, at 78 days \u2013 gave the Liberals the time to build on that boost. Trudeau told the Guardian in July that he relished it: \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing that recent history in Canada has shown it\u2019s that campaigns really matter. And there\u2019s a tremendous volatility among voters who are just looking for the right alternative.\u201d Trudeau, for all his dynastic connections, aimed to be that alternative. Almost literally born to the role of prime minister \u2013 he was born in 1971, during his father\u2019s first term \u2013 he took a circuitous route into political life, trying his hand at teaching, engineering, bungee-jumping coaching, environmental geography, charity boxing and acting, before ousting Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois MP Vivian Barbot to become MP for Papineau in the 2008 general election. In 2000, at his father\u2019s state funeral, Trudeau delivered a eulogy that stoked whispers of a dynasty that has now secured its place in Canadian history: \u201cMore than anything, to me, he was dad. And what a dad. He loved us with the passion and the devotion that encompassed his life. He taught us to believe in ourselves, to stand up for ourselves, to know ourselves and to accept responsibility for ourselves. \u201cWe knew we were the luckiest kids in the world. And we had done nothing to actually deserve it. \u201cIt was instead something that we would have to spend the rest of our lives to work very hard to live up to.\u201d Trudeau on climate change He has promised a climate change policy agreed with the provinces within 90 days of the UN climate change summit in Paris in November. On indigenous rights \u201cWe will build a renewed relationship with indigenous peoples on a nation-to-nation basis,\u201d he has said. \u201cThat will include, for example, a national public inquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women and girls.

Each is the other\u2019s largest trading partner: trade between the two countries in 2012 \u2013 the most recent year for which data is available from the <a href=\"https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/americas/canada\">Office of the United States Trade Representative</a> \u2013 totalled $707bn. </p> <p>Canada is also the world\u2019s largest national importer of US goods, spending $51bn a year on US-made cars alone. It is also the second-largest importer of US agricultural products.</p> <p>After nearly 10 years in power, the Canadian Conservatives are a known quantity. But Harper\u2019s relationships with other leaders on the continent \u2013 especially Barack Obama \u2013 have suffered. Trudeau\u2019s centre-left Liberals, while also nominally pro-Keystone, have spoken out about the importance of balancing the environmental impacts of the policy. Tom Mulcair\u2019s New Democrats have campaigned against it, echoing the opposition of US Democrats including <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/news-video/video-mulcair-echoes-clintons-opposition-to-keystone-xl-pipeline/article26516604/\">Hillary Clinton</a>.</p> <p>Harper\u2019s relationship with Obama also deteriorated when the Canadian prime minister felt pushed out of negotiations between the US and Japan over the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/10/obama-defends-tpp-deal-dismisses-secrecy-concerns\">Trans-Pacific Partnership</a>, according to <a href=\"http://aix1.uottawa.ca/~rparis/\">Professor Roland Paris</a>, who studies international security and governance at the University of Ottawa.</p> <p>There would be \u201cmuch more alignment\u201d between US Democrats and a Liberal Canadian government, said <a href=\"http://hkstrategies.ca/expert/elizabeth-roscoe/\">Elizabeth Roscoe</a>, senior public affairs strategist at Hill and Knowlton, a Canadian public relations firm, especially as Trudeau and Clinton \u201cshare a lot of advisers, and approach\u201d. </p> <p>Republicans in the US \u201csee more eye-to-eye\u201d with the Conservatives in Canada, she said.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>I think that what you would see very quickly with a Liberal government led by Justin Trudeau is a more conciliatory tone</p> <footer> <cite>Professor Roland Paris, University of Ottawa</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Canadian participation in the US-led coalition against Islamic State militants in Syria and Iraq is also in question. Canada has six F-18 jets in Kuwait, flying sorties against Isis, and a special operations unit in Iraqi Kurdistan training Kurdish peshmerga forces. The Conservatives have campaigned to keep those missions going. </p> <p>But the Liberals have indicated that they would end the air mission, and the NDP would remove all non-Nato Canadian military presence from the region.</p> <p>Canada\u2019s relations with Mexico have also suffered, in the face of Harper\u2019s government\u2019s hardline stance towards immigrants. The situation got so bad that Harper postponed a North American Summit scheduled for spring \u2013 the so-called \u201cthree amigos\u201d summit.</p> <p>\u201cI think that what you would see very quickly with a Liberal government led by Justin Trudeau is first of all a change in tone, a more conciliatory tone,\u201d said Professor Paris. </p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that you would get the hectoring [like you get with Harper], and that would be true both for relations with the US and Mexico.\u201d<br></p> <p>But perhaps the most important issue separating the two countries is the philosophical distance between Obama and Harper on the issue of climate change. Many US politicians, especially on the left, see Harper\u2019s administration as having acted blindly in the face of environmental issues. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/16/canada-election-stephen-harper-fossil-fuel-backfires\">Canada election: how Stephen Harper\u2019s fossil fuel gamble may have backfired</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The issue is coming to a head: in April, the US took over the chair of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/17/arctic-alaska-global-warming-threatens-ice-cap\">Arctic Council</a> from Canadian environment minister Leona Aglukkaq.

          "bodyText": "America\u2019s neighbour to the north will head to the polls on Monday for what looks likely to be a nail-bitingly close election. The incumbent Conservatives, under Stephen Harper, have not been popular with the Obama administration, partly because they have lobbied the US hard to build the Keystone XL pipeline. But with Liberal leader Justin Trudeau\u2019s party predicted to win the most seats \u2013 if not an outright majority \u2013 experts say there is a chance of a thaw in relations between the two countries in time to facilitate real action on issues like climate change. Of course, the US and Canada are deeply intertwined economically. Each is the other\u2019s largest trading partner: trade between the two countries in 2012 \u2013 the most recent year for which data is available from the Office of the United States Trade Representative \u2013 totalled $707bn. Canada is also the world\u2019s largest national importer of US goods, spending $51bn a year on US-made cars alone. It is also the second-largest importer of US agricultural products. After nearly 10 years in power, the Canadian Conservatives are a known quantity. But Harper\u2019s relationships with other leaders on the continent \u2013 especially Barack Obama \u2013 have suffered. Trudeau\u2019s centre-left Liberals, while also nominally pro-Keystone, have spoken out about the importance of balancing the environmental impacts of the policy. Tom Mulcair\u2019s New Democrats have campaigned against it, echoing the opposition of US Democrats including Hillary Clinton. Harper\u2019s relationship with Obama also deteriorated when the Canadian prime minister felt pushed out of negotiations between the US and Japan over the Trans-Pacific Partnership, according to Professor Roland Paris, who studies international security and governance at the University of Ottawa. There would be \u201cmuch more alignment\u201d between US Democrats and a Liberal Canadian government, said Elizabeth Roscoe, senior public affairs strategist at Hill and Knowlton, a Canadian public relations firm, especially as Trudeau and Clinton \u201cshare a lot of advisers, and approach\u201d. Republicans in the US \u201csee more eye-to-eye\u201d with the Conservatives in Canada, she said. Canadian participation in the US-led coalition against Islamic State militants in Syria and Iraq is also in question. Canada has six F-18 jets in Kuwait, flying sorties against Isis, and a special operations unit in Iraqi Kurdistan training Kurdish peshmerga forces. The Conservatives have campaigned to keep those missions going. But the Liberals have indicated that they would end the air mission, and the NDP would remove all non-Nato Canadian military presence from the region. Canada\u2019s relations with Mexico have also suffered, in the face of Harper\u2019s government\u2019s hardline stance towards immigrants. The situation got so bad that Harper postponed a North American Summit scheduled for spring \u2013 the so-called \u201cthree amigos\u201d summit. \u201cI think that what you would see very quickly with a Liberal government led by Justin Trudeau is first of all a change in tone, a more conciliatory tone,\u201d said Professor Paris. \u201cI don\u2019t think that you would get the hectoring [like you get with Harper], and that would be true both for relations with the US and Mexico.\u201d But perhaps the most important issue separating the two countries is the philosophical distance between Obama and Harper on the issue of climate change. Many US politicians, especially on the left, see Harper\u2019s administration as having acted blindly in the face of environmental issues. The issue is coming to a head: in April, the US took over the chair of the Arctic Council from Canadian environment minister Leona Aglukkaq. John Kerry, the US secretary of state, pledged to pivot the organisation\u2019s focus towards the climate. Of the three leaders vying for electoral success in Canada, Trudeau is the only one to have addressed the Canada-US relationship directly in a speech. \u201cFor our American cousins, the relationship is consequential. For us, it has often been definitional,\u201d he said in June. Trudeau accused the Conservatives of having \u201cbadly misread\u201d the US-Canada relationship and said they had \u201cmissed important opportunities to cooperate with the US to find solutions to major issues like climate change\u201d. Trudeau is leading in the polls, so it seems increasingly likely that he will be the prime minister for the final year of Obama\u2019s presidency and the opening years of his successor\u2019s. It is possible the US president will find in him a more willing partner in his attempt to leave a lasting environmental legacy.",

Today, however, Chief Na\u2019Moks and many other First Nations leaders are at the forefront of a struggle against a very different kind of oil business: Canada\u2019s largest proposed tar sands pipeline, the Northern Gateway.</p> <p>It is the country\u2019s environmental battle of the decade, uniting a wide variety of citizens\u2019 groups against the billions of dollars of investment by oil companies and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/true-north/2015/aug/11/canadian-government-spent-millions-on-secret-tar-sands-advocacy\">millions in secret funding</a> from the government. First proposed in 2004, the Enbridge Northern Gateway pipeline was planned for a 731-mile (1,177km) stretch from the center of Alberta to the coast of British Columbia.</p> <p>The plan was to carry diluted bitumen from the tar sands, across hundreds of waterways, over two major mountain ranges and through some of the wildest country in North America. It was approved, with 209 conditions, in June of 2014.<br></p> <p>Environmental groups, citizen activists and First Nations have used everything from lawsuits to old-fashioned civil disobedience to battle the project \u2013 and so far they have been successful. No mean feat, considering that Canadian prime minister <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/15/stephen-harper-master-manipulator\">Stephen Harper</a> took office in 2006 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/16/canada-election-stephen-harper-fossil-fuel-backfires\">pledging to make the country into an \u201cenergy superpower\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Seeking a fourth term in office in federal elections on Monday, Harper\u2019s Conservative party has been decidedly quiet the subject of fossil fuels. Last year\u2019s crash in oil prices and Harper\u2019s failure to build the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/keystone-xl-pipeline\">Keystone XL pipeline</a> have both sent tremors through the country\u2019s fossil-fuel industries. </p> <p>Then in May, the upstart New Democratic Party <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/06/canada-alberta-elects-leftwing-party-keystone-pipeline\">won a stunning victory in Alberta\u2019s provincial elections</a>, ending 44 years of Conservative rule. </p> <p>The Northern Gateway played a crucial role in that election: Alberta\u2019s former premier Jim Prentice had previously been employed by the pipeline company Enbridge to make peace with First Nations opposed to the the pipeline. As premier, he tried to get First Nations <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/true-north/2015/apr/29/revealed-albertas-ploy-to-break-first-nations-pipeline-opposition\">to agree to pipelines</a> by offering them a share in the profits.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"18870506652e878814ba33d19baa6744def8dcff\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/10/17/1445113258418/df9f6ca3-7228-4c76-bbc1-fbcaa0b3ffe5-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"indigenous first nations pipeline canada\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eight First Nations are involved in a lawsuit that could be decisive in the pipeline controversy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The leaders of the two largest opposition parties \u2013 the New Democratic Party and the Liberals \u2013 have vowed far greater oversight of the oil industry. NDP leader <a href=\"http://globalnews.ca/news/2175879/pipeline-politics-what-you-need-to-know-about-oilsands-and-the-2015-election/\">Tom Mulcair has said</a> the approval process for pipelines is \u201csingularly defective\u201d. And Liberal leader Justin Trudeau said it was \u201cnot for governments to be cheerleaders for various pipelines\u201d.</p> <p>Even as the political battles rage, the Northern Gateway is back in court for a new round that may prove decisive. A group of First Nations, environmental organizations and a labor union argued that the approval process for the pipeline was flawed, did not take environmental impact into account and violated the rights of First Nations. It was the longest case ever heard before the federal court of appeals, Canada\u2019s second-highest federal court.<br></p> <p>The Haisla are one of eight First Nations taking part in the case. When Gerald Amos, whose Haisla name is Gagamguist, was asked what the Conservative government could do to work better with First nations, he simply responded: \u201cThe best thing that can happen with the conservative government is to be un-elected.\u201d<br></p> <p>Amos was sitting on the beach in Kitimat Village, the traditional fishing village of his people that sits on an inlet of Douglas Channel. He spoke slowly, weighing his words. \u201cThe only good thing that\u2019s come out of Enbridge is it has brought us together,\u201d he said.<br></p> <p>He was speaking about the First Nations village and the industry town supporting an aluminum smelter that largely joined forces for the Enbridge fight. As Canada\u2019s election approaches, the race remains too close to call. Many people will be voting based on the politics and economics of oil, pipelines and the environment.<br></p> <p>\u201cCanada has to remind themselves of who they are,\u201d said Chief Na\u2019Moks. \u201cI believe that all Canadians should vote, and vote properly \u2013 vote for your future, not just for words.\u201d<br></p>",

Today, however, Chief Na\u2019Moks and many other First Nations leaders are at the forefront of a struggle against a very different kind of oil business: Canada\u2019s largest proposed tar sands pipeline, the Northern Gateway. It is the country\u2019s environmental battle of the decade, uniting a wide variety of citizens\u2019 groups against the billions of dollars of investment by oil companies and millions in secret funding from the government. First proposed in 2004, the Enbridge Northern Gateway pipeline was planned for a 731-mile (1,177km) stretch from the center of Alberta to the coast of British Columbia. The plan was to carry diluted bitumen from the tar sands, across hundreds of waterways, over two major mountain ranges and through some of the wildest country in North America. It was approved, with 209 conditions, in June of 2014. Environmental groups, citizen activists and First Nations have used everything from lawsuits to old-fashioned civil disobedience to battle the project \u2013 and so far they have been successful. No mean feat, considering that Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper took office in 2006 pledging to make the country into an \u201cenergy superpower\u201d. Seeking a fourth term in office in federal elections on Monday, Harper\u2019s Conservative party has been decidedly quiet the subject of fossil fuels. Last year\u2019s crash in oil prices and Harper\u2019s failure to build the Keystone XL pipeline have both sent tremors through the country\u2019s fossil-fuel industries. Then in May, the upstart New Democratic Party won a stunning victory in Alberta\u2019s provincial elections, ending 44 years of Conservative rule. The Northern Gateway played a crucial role in that election: Alberta\u2019s former premier Jim Prentice had previously been employed by the pipeline company Enbridge to make peace with First Nations opposed to the the pipeline. As premier, he tried to get First Nations to agree to pipelines by offering them a share in the profits. The leaders of the two largest opposition parties \u2013 the New Democratic Party and the Liberals \u2013 have vowed far greater oversight of the oil industry. NDP leader Tom Mulcair has said the approval process for pipelines is \u201csingularly defective\u201d. And Liberal leader Justin Trudeau said it was \u201cnot for governments to be cheerleaders for various pipelines\u201d. Even as the political battles rage, the Northern Gateway is back in court for a new round that may prove decisive. A group of First Nations, environmental organizations and a labor union argued that the approval process for the pipeline was flawed, did not take environmental impact into account and violated the rights of First Nations. It was the longest case ever heard before the federal court of appeals, Canada\u2019s second-highest federal court. The Haisla are one of eight First Nations taking part in the case. When Gerald Amos, whose Haisla name is Gagamguist, was asked what the Conservative government could do to work better with First nations, he simply responded: \u201cThe best thing that can happen with the conservative government is to be un-elected.\u201d Amos was sitting on the beach in Kitimat Village, the traditional fishing village of his people that sits on an inlet of Douglas Channel. He spoke slowly, weighing his words. \u201cThe only good thing that\u2019s come out of Enbridge is it has brought us together,\u201d he said. He was speaking about the First Nations village and the industry town supporting an aluminum smelter that largely joined forces for the Enbridge fight. As Canada\u2019s election approaches, the race remains too close to call. Many people will be voting based on the politics and economics of oil, pipelines and the environment. \u201cCanada has to remind themselves of who they are,\u201d said Chief Na\u2019Moks. \u201cI believe that all Canadians should vote, and vote properly \u2013 vote for your future, not just for words.\u201d",

My son was born here. How dare you.\u201d Harper turned to anti-immigrant campaigning because his usual message of sound economic stewardship would no longer fly. Canada returned to recession in 2015\u2019s first quarter, the only G7 economy to do so. Karen McCrimmon, a retired air force lieutenant-colonel and former Liberal leadership candidate who is running for the Kanata-Carleton riding outside Ottawa, told the Guardian that the economic narrative became \u201cweak\u201d for her Conservative opponent. \u201cI drive down the main street here where my campaign office is; maybe it\u2019s a kilometre,\u201d McCrimmon told the Guardian. \u201cOn that one strip, there\u2019s 25 vacant commercial properties. People don\u2019t have to look very far to see the evidence that their economic plan isn\u2019t working.\u201d The Conservatives won by nearly 28 percentage points here in 2011, but the latest polls give McCrimmon a lead of 50-39 \u2013 indicating a truly stupendous vote swing in the order of 41 points, though this may in part be linked to the fact that the Conservative incumbent is not standing again. A draconian counter-terrorism bill, C-51, also inspired opposition to Harper. But Trudeau\u2019s Liberals, who also voted for the bill - though with amendments - were also caught in the controversy. Vahidy, a life-long Liberal supporter and energetic party activist, actually switched and became a card-carrying member of the left-wing New Democrat Party. \u201cI was so angry,\u201d she said. That tide of anger helped carry the NDP and their leader Tom Mulcair to an early lead in the polls when the campaign began in earnest at the beginning of August. But it was not to last. After languishing in third place for much of the summer, the Liberal party climbed steadily, according to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation\u2019s polling aggregate. This projects the Liberals winning with 130 seats \u2013 a win, but still not the majority of 170 required to form a majority government. The NDP, whose national support has slipped from a high of almost 40% in August to around 24% now, lost the support of people like Vahidy. She realised, she said, that Trudeau had supported C51 in order to add amendments to it, which struck her on second glance as shrewd. They have also promised to change the bill once in power. Canada is a country with an overwhelming progressive majority that has been kept from government because the left is split into two parties, while the right is united. In 2008, the NDP and the Liberals reached a coalition accord with the help of the seperatist Bloc Quebecois; but it was controversial and unpopular, and fell apart. This may not be the case in 2015. \u201cIn the platform, we have a commitment to working with other federalist, non-Conservative parties, to end the Conservative government,\u201d a senior NDP campaign source told the Guardian. \u201cThat clearly means that [Mulcair] wants to reach out and work with other parties.\u201d Meanwhile, the Conservatives turned to ever-more desperate measures. At a campaign stop Thursday in Trois Rivieres, Quebec \u2013 a town about 85 miles northeast of Montreal \u2013 Harper brought out what the Liberals are deriding as a \u201cgame show gimmick\u201d. It was a show-and-tell tactic the Conservative leader had started to deploy at rallies earlier in the week, around the same time national polls began definitively indicating that Trudeau, had gained a lead, especially in seat-rich Ontario. Harper would call up supporters \u2013 in this case it was Paul and Miriam Greth \u2013 and had them toss cash on the table as he ran through the benefits and tax breaks he warned the Greth family would lose under a Liberal government. \u201cThat\u2019s another 600 bucks down the drain,\u201d he said, his words accompanied by the loud \u2018Ka-ching\u2019 sound of a cash register. \u201cThat is what Liberal change means, more money for the government, less money for you.\u201d In the dying days of the campaign, Harper has focused his attention on Trudeau directly. \u201cFriends,\u201d he told party faithful, \u201cI understand the temptation for change is strong, but do you want to bet the future of your family on change?\u201d It was not the first time Harper has conceded that his government is looking a little tired after nearly a decade in power. An ad released mid-campaign admitted: \u201cStephen Harper isn\u2019t perfect.\u201d Jason Lietaer, president of Enterprise Canada and a Conservative strategist not working on the current campaign, predicts the Conservatives will continue to push the ballot question of stability (them) versus risk (the surging Liberals) until October 19. \u201cThey will continue to be focused on one thing and one thing only \u2013 the personal consequences to the family budget of a Justin Trudeau victory.\u201d Harper has never been a widely beloved politician \u2013 last election he won a majority with just over 39% of the popular vote \u2013 and Lietaer admitted it might be an uphill battle to convince even core Conservative voters to support a fourth Harper mandate. \u201cYou\u2019ve been around for 10 years, there\u2019s a fresh new face who\u2019s run a decent campaign and the question is, do you have one more go at it?\u201d he said. \u2022 This article was amended on 19 October 2015.

          "body": "<p>An unkind cartoon this summer showed the Canadian prime minister, Stephen Harper, kneeling before the statue of another politician, asking: \u201cWhat now, O Great One?\u201d That in itself would not be unkind. The punchline is that the statue is clearly labelled as that of Richard Nixon, famed above all for his attempts to corrupt democracy.</p> <p>As Harper tries for a fourth term in office at the Canadian federal election next week, he is trailed by an extraordinarily long list of allegations. In the Watergate scandal, all the president\u2019s men were accused primarily of breaking the law to get Nixon a second term in the White House. In Canada, some of the prime minister\u2019s men and women have been accused not simply of cheating to win elections but of conspiring to jam the machinery of democratic government.</p> <p>Some of these allegations have been proved. In the 11 years since he became leader of the country\u2019s Conservatives, the party has been fined for breaking electoral rules, and various members of Team Harper have been caught misleading parliament, gagging civil servants, subverting parliamentary committees, gagging scientists, harassing the supreme court, gagging diplomats, lying to the public, concealing evidence of potential crime, spying on opponents, bullying and smearing. Harper personally has earned himself the rare rebuke of being found to be in contempt of his parliament.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/03/canada-election-parliament-stephen-harper\">Canada election 2015: a guide to the parties, polls and electoral system</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One of his many biographers, John Ibbitson of the <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/authors/john-ibbitson\">Globe and Mail</a> newspaper, who is more sympathetic than most, concludes: \u201cNo prime minister in history and no political party have been loathed as intensely as Stephen Harper and the Conservative party.\u201d Yet this deeply unpopular politician has won three elections in the last nine years. Although the Liberals are showing a late lead in the polls, Harper\u2019s emphasis on his record on security and the economy may yet put a fourth in his trophy cabinet next week. That is what makes Harper\u2019s politics interesting, that he has perfected the tactics of taking and holding power \u2013 in spite of the demands of democracy.</p> <p>His people have been caught out more often than most. That may be because they are more brazen than most (and because they have some particularly feisty investigative reporters on their patch). But, at heart, Harper\u2019s team are not that different from politicians across the developed world who have discovered that democracy is a pretty sweet theory but that, in reality, if you want to get hold of power and use it, there are all kinds of devious moves available that have very little to do with that antique idea.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>Harper has perfected the tactics of taking and holding power \u2013 in spite of the demands of democracy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p><strong>Start with the business of winning an election.</strong> During Harper\u2019s first successful run, back in January 2006, his party bumped up against the limit that it was allowed to spend in its national campaign \u2013 18.3m Canadian dollars ($9.15m). But it still had money in the bank, and the race was very tight. So it channelled more than $1m down to 67 local candidates who had their own budgets and who then paid for a blitz of TV advertising during the final fortnight of the campaign. Harper squeaked home with 21 more seats than the liberals, and managed to form a minority government with 36% of the vote. Some of the local Conservatives were worried that this was illegal, but Harper\u2019s national director dismissed them with contempt. \u201cWhat a bunch of turds,\u201d he emailed.</p> <p>The national officials evidently had persuaded themselves that they had the law on their side. <a href=\"http://www.elections.ca/home.aspx\">Elections Canada</a>, the official body that enforces polling law, disagreed. As one of its investigators put it: \u201cYou could argue that they stole the election.\u201d Team Harper duly suffered the indignity of police raiding their headquarters in Ottawa, seizing their computers and paperwork, and the further embarrassment of having four senior officials charged with criminal offences. The Conservatives fought Elections Canada to the last ditch, repeatedly challenging it in the courts. Finally, the prosecution accepted a plea bargain. The charges against the four officials were dropped, while the party as an organisation pleaded guilty to illegal campaign spending and paid $282,000 in fines and restitution. That was in March 2012, more than six years after the offence, by which time this particular scandal had cobwebs on it, and Harper had won two more elections, in November 2008 and May 2011.</p> <p>If the path to electoral crime is rarely trodden, there is a close alternative, what Nixon\u2019s people called \u201cratfucking\u201d \u2013 acts of sabotage to damage an opponent. Not exactly criminal. Not always. So, for example, when the current Liberal leader, Justin Trudeau (son of the former prime minister, Pierre) held an open-air press conference in Ottawa, he found himself being heckled by a group of young protesters waving placards. They were later revealed by the Huffington Post to be interns working for the Prime Minister\u2019s Office.</p> <p>In the fortnight before polling day in 2011, Liberal supporters started receiving nuisance calls from people who claimed to be Liberal party workers \u2013 calling Jewish voters on the sabbath, waking up others in the middle of the night. Liberals said this was Conservatives trying to alienate their support. Then, in the final three days before the vote, Elections Canada received a series of complaints about \u201crobocalls\u201d \u2013 recorded messages sent by automatic dialling \u2013 that told voters quite falsely that their polling station had been moved. By election day, anxiety was rising among officials, as internal emails recorded: \u201cIt seems that Conservative candidates are pretending that Elections Canada or returning officers have changed the polling stations \u2026 They have actually disrupted the voting process \u2026 It\u2019s right across the country except Saskatchewan \u2026 It appears it is getting worse.\u201d This looked like a national campaign to suppress the Liberal vote by scattering it away from the polling booths.</p> <p>Some of those voters told the Guardian that they had first received a call from the Conservatives asking how they planned to vote. Sandra McEwing, a stage manager from Winnipeg, said: \u201cMy answer was unequivocal, like, \u2018Go fuck yourself.\u2019 I hung up after that.\u201d Others say they gave similar replies. All then say they received robocalls or live calls, sending them to a polling station that did not exist or to a distant one where they had no right to vote. Some of these voters were in ridings, or electoral districts, where the eventual margin of victory was tiny. Bill Hagborn, president of the Liberal association in a riding in Ontario, told of a bus full of aboriginal voters, who were very unlikely to vote Conservative, and who were misdirected by calls and ended up not voting at all. That riding \u2013 Nipissing-Timiskaming \u2013 went to the Conservatives with a majority of only 18.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0ab0409f3ce7761cd1dfec08139585b58d2d2556\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ab0409f3ce7761cd1dfec08139585b58d2d2556/0_0_4288_2572/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stephen Harper meets voters in Ontario during his first victorious election campaign, in 2006.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stephen Harper meets voters in Ontario during his first victorious election campaign, in 2006.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Hayter/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With Team Harper back in power, a group of voters from six ridings went to federal court to challenge the results of the election. After a seven-day hearing, the trial judge, Mr Justice Mosley, issued a devastating verdict: \u201cI am satisfied that it has been established that misleading calls about the locations of polling stations were made to electors in ridings across the country and that the purpose of those calls was to suppress the votes of electors who had indicated their preference in response to earlier voter-identification calls.\u201d</p> <p>The judge declined to order new elections \u2013 the evidence did not reveal whether the calls had actually swung the result \u2013 but the declaration of national fraud was powerful stuff. And perhaps even more serious, he found that \u201cthe most likely source\u201d of the phone numbers that had been used was the Conservative party\u2019s central database, the Constituent Information Management System (Cims), which is believed to hold the names and addresses of every voter in Canada, together with profiling information that has been gathered by party workers or bought from commercial data-gatherers.</p> <p>The judge specifically avoided identifying the Conservative party as a whole, or its candidates, as having organised the fraud. However, he went on to complain that it had \u201cengaged in trench warfare in an effort to prevent this case from coming to a hearing on the merits\u201d, which had included \u201ctransparent attempts to derail this case\u201d.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Elections Canada had been investigating. Spurred on by news coverage, voters from 261 of the 308 ridings filed complaints about calls that either caused nuisance or misled them about their polling station. The investigators struggled. When they tried to get records of phone numbers that had called the complainants, they failed in 92.5% of cases. With the 7.5% where they succeeded, they then failed to find the owners of 40% of the phone numbers they had identified, including many that were registered across the border in the US. \u201cWe were running into brick walls all over the place,\u201d as one investigator put it. With one startling exception.</p> <p>In relation to the riding of Guelph in Ontario, the Conservatives who had engaged in \u201ctrench warfare\u201d to impede the civil court, handed Elections Canada a group of witnesses who identified an ambitious young party worker, Michael Sona, as a culprit, adding crucially that he had acted without authority, as a \u201crogue activist\u201d. Sona\u2019s name was rapidly leaked to newspapers. Investigators were able to follow a trail of electronic footprints from the local Conservative office, where Sona worked, to a telemarketing company that had sent out a robocall to more than 7,000 Liberal households, diverting them from their polling stations. Sona was arrested, prosecuted and jailed for nine months for interfering with an election. He says that he is innocent, a decoy thrown out to protect the real culprits. Others say he is a maverick who set up his own relatively clumsy scheme without the blessing of his party.</p> <p>But what about all the other ridings? Elections Canada in April 2014 published a report in which it acknowledged the difficulties it had encountered, and reported that \u2013 with the exception of Guelph \u2013 that it had been unable to find any concrete evidence of dubious activity. This left open the possibility that voters in these ridings had been victims of something far more sophisticated than the clumsy operation for which Michael Sona had been blamed. In Ottawa today, political insiders claim to have heard Conservative workers boasting of using call centres in the US, India or the Philippines.</p> <p>However, they can prove nothing, and Elections Canada not only found no such clues but enraged Harper\u2019s opponents by concluding that its inability to find evidence of activity outside Guelph amounted to positive evidence that there had been no such activity. This contradicted the finding of Mr Justice Mosley and implied that all of the complainants from outside Guelph had been tainted by confusion, delusion or dishonesty. No culprit other than Michael Sona has been brought to book.</p> <p>Effectively cleared of responsibility, the Conservatives pushed back hard. When Elections Canada asked for more powers to help it investigate future fraud claims, the House of Commons backed them. The Harper government, however, denied the body the powers it wanted and removed its entire investigations branch, transferring it to the office of the public prosecutor, where it is no longer answerable to parliament. Meanwhile, the Conservative MP who had acted as Harper\u2019s spokesman on the robocalls affair \u2013 his parliamentary secretary, Dean Del Mastro \u2013 was jailed for breaking spending limits in his own riding and submitting false records. The sentencing judge told him that he had indulged in \u201cthe antithesis of democracy\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p><strong>Stephen Harper has not been convicted of any crime.</strong> But his character appears to have had a big impact on the way that his team behaves. He is a loner \u2013 a suburban boy who went trainspotting with his dad; whose asthma stopped him playing ice hockey but who knew more hockey stats than anyone else; who became an economist while his two brothers became accountants because, as he said, he did not have the personality to be an accountant. He was a loner who learned to scorn the happy crowd. One of his biographers, Lawrence Martin, found a source who remembered the young Harper at social events in his 20s as \u201cthe guy in the corner, pen and paper in pocket, looking at us in a condescending way. It was like \u2018Those kids! There they are, drinking again.\u2019\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>Harper is a loner \u2013 a suburban boy who went trainspotting with his dad; whose asthma stopped him playing ice hockey</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That scorn appears to have interrupted the clever student\u2019s journey to the top of the class. In his first term at university in Toronto, in 1978, he alarmed his family by dropping out, apparently because he could not stand his classmates and their sense of entitlement. He went west to Alberta, which is like leaving New York to go to Texas \u2013 from the bright lights of the city to the oil and gas fields that keep those lights burning; from money and privilege to hard graft and resentment; from progressive to conservative. He worked for three years as a clerk at Imperial Oil before returning to university, this time in Calgary, Alberta. It was 1981. The university was infused with anger at the Liberal prime minister Pierre Trudeau\u2019s plans to suppress the price of Alberta\u2019s oil and to tax it for the benefit of the rest of Canada. That hostility to the progressive elite may have struck a personal chord with the young man who felt he did not fit in to Toronto society. It found intellectual shape in Calgary in the rightwing theories of Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman, which were already being turned into reality by the governments of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan.</p> <p>Harper left university in 1984 and spent the next 20 years working his way upwards and rightwards through Canadian politics, first as an aide for the ruling Progressive Conservatives, then as an MP for the even more conservative Reform party. He quit to become vice president of the National Citizens Coalition, which lobbied for neoconservative causes. Finally, in March 2002, he became leader of the new Alliance party, which was scooping up the anti-tax, anti-union vote. By now the mainstream Progressive Conservatives were in an electoral wasteland. Harper engineered a merger and, in March 2004, aged 44, he became the leader of a new and distinctly rightwing Conservative party. He had shown himself to be unusually smart, enormously hard-working, relentless. He had also attracted the words that were to follow him: cold, aloof, ruthless. And angry. John Ibbitson records a story from an aide who saw Harper exploding on his campaign bus during the June 2004 election, which he lost: \u201cIt was: \u2018We are fucking going to do this, and you are fucking going to do that, and I want to see this fucking thing done right now.\u2019 And then he paused and asked: \u2018And why does nothing happen around here unless I say \u2018fuck\u2019?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5d7ffd571e823a4c21071f72b06ebf36fdf176d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d7ffd571e823a4c21071f72b06ebf36fdf176d2/0_59_3013_1807/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Harper in 2008.

Knowing that there is a block of rightwing voters who have nowhere else to go, he has been willing to defy them in search of wider support: adopting liberal positions on abortion and gay marriage; veering leftwards to pump public money into the economy to avoid recession in 2008; reaching out to the migrants who now fill the suburbs of traditionally Liberal cities such as Toronto. He studies the stats. He makes the numbers add up. Harper has his roots in the same ideological soil as Thatcher and Reagan: cutting tax and rolling back the state; tough on crime and even tougher on the unions; boosting families and national pride; a solid economy that rewards those who work hard.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>Harper has his roots in the same ideological soil as Thatcher and Reagan: cutting tax and rolling back the state</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And then there were the tactics that were to attract such notoriety. They reflected the man\u2019s character \u2013 clever and harsh \u2013 moves that turned a democratic election into a mere sequence of manoeuvres. He learned from the master, Arthur Finkelstein, who had played the electoral game for Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan. One of Harper\u2019s early allies from the 1990s, Gerry Nicholls, captured in his memoirs the special cynicism of Finkelstein\u2019s will to manipulate the electorate in his dictum: \u201cWe have to convince Canadians to drink pig\u2019s piss.\u201d</p> <p>This meant, first of all, spending very little time on the big questions about the economy or public services or the environment and turning instead to an arsenal of aggression: attack ads to smear the opposition, like the one that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PikszBkfTHM\">focused on a Liberal leader\u2019s facial disfigurement</a>, caused by Bell\u2019s palsy, or one that featured a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2hHbaE0yqY\">puffin shitting on another Liberal leader\u2019s shoulder</a>. He also exploited \u201cwedge\u201d issues that aim to alienate a section of the opposition support, such as demanding the closure of the unit where heroin addicts in Vancouver can get safe injections.</p> <p>It meant money \u2013 millions in private donations to fund the campaign, and millions more in state giveaways in order to encourage the voters. Just as Margaret Thatcher cut income tax to make Tory voting pay, so Harper gave his electorate a high-profile gift when he first took power in 2006, by cutting the Canadian sales tax, GST. It cost the exchequer some $12bn, but it purchased popularity. At times, it meant descending into old-fashioned, US-style pork-barrel politics, pouring public money into ridings that were politically important. An <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/government-favours-infrastructure-projects-to-conservative-ridings/article25492064/\">investigation by the Globe and Mail this year</a> found that 83% of the Harper government\u2019s new infrastructure projects had gone to the 52% of ridings that were in Conservative hands.</p> <p>And it meant investing heavily in the politically profitable new science of microtargeting. This was the original reason for the Conservatives creating the Cims database, in which was stored every conceivable item of intelligence about voters. Other parties have since caught up, but at that time it allowed the Conservative party to target the \u201cmarket segments\u201d it needed for victory \u2013 not just with policy, but with favours. A $500 tax break for children to do ballet or hockey in the 2006 budget was good for a middle-class segment (this was doubled in 2014). A break for tradespeople\u2019s tools could buy another. The Canadian writer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/susandelacourt\">Susan Delacourt</a>, who tracked this in her book, Shopping For Votes, told of the finding in the Cims database that people who owned snowmobiles were potential Conservative voters. The Harper government has pledged $35m to create new trails for snowmobiles.</p> <p>These tactics have proved particularly effective in a world in which people are becoming alienated from politics itself. In Canada, nearly 40% of the electorate did not bother to vote at the 2011 election. Among voters under 24, more than 60% stayed away (compared with 35.3% in 2006). A poll in Quebec province two months ago found that as the federal election campaign was launched, 20% of respondents could not name the political party that was running the country. Delacourt cites one of Harper\u2019s political marketers, Patrick Muttart, saying that much of Conservative activity was aimed at voters who paid no attention to politics and who needed messages that were \u201cbrutally simple\u201d.</p> <p>In power as in elections, Harper\u2019s rule has been to keep winning, whatever it takes. Even parliament \u2013 the embodiment of the popular will \u2013 is merely an obstacle to be dealt with. Soon after the November 2008 election, as he began his second minority government, Harper launched an \u201comnibus bill\u201d, which contained so many provocative proposals that he united the previously divided opposition parties, which decided not just to vote against the bill but to form a coalition that could replace his government. Harper didn\u2019t want that. So he prorogued parliament. He needed the consent of the Queen\u2019s representative, the governor general, to do so. He got it. And so the parliament that threatened him was simply suspended until the political storm passed.</p> <p>A year later, Harper was in deep trouble again, over press reports that Canadian soldiers in Afghanistan had handed over Taliban prisoners to local security forces, who had then tortured them. Harper\u2019s government had denied the claims, which amounted to allegations of war crime, but it was caught out badly in November 2009 when a Canadian diplomat and a general separately went public with evidence that parts of the government had known about this for more than three years. When the opposition united once more to demand the release of paperwork on the subject, Harper refused \u2026 and then persuaded the governor general to prorogue parliament again. There was a chorus of protest, led by professors of law and politics, but Harper scorned them. The elected representatives of the people were simply locked out for three months.</p> <p>The following year, Harper clashed again with the rights of parliament. In July 2010, he announced that his government would buy 65 F-35 fighter jets, costing a total of $15bn \u2013 the most expensive military purchase in Canadian history. The new Liberal leader, Michael Ignatieff, reckoned the real price would be even higher and accused Harper of deliberately understating it. Harper refused to hand over the paperwork that would disclose the truth about the F-35s and about the cost of a clutch of other policies. In March 2011, the speaker of the House of Commons ruled that this was a contempt of parliament, and the House then passed a vote of no confidence in Harper\u2019s government. There was an election (involving the robocalls), which Harper won. Ignatieff quit. And 11 months later, it emerged that the true cost of the F-35s was nearly twice what Harper had claimed. In 2007, his second year in office, the National Post disclosed that Team Harper had drawn up a guidebook for the Conservative chairs of parliamentary committees, advising them how to use delays, obstruction and confusion to block difficult inquiries. In opposition, Harper said he would reform the Senate, so that its members would be elected. In office, he changed his mind, kept the power to select them himself and appointed 59 new senators so that he had a built-in majority in the upper house. The House of Commons found itself being swamped with omnibus bills, which included dozens of contentious proposals that could not be properly debated in the time available. At the daily Question Period, when ministers traditionally provide information, Harper\u2019s parliamentary secretary, Paul Calandra, gave answers so obstructive that, after a volley of complaint, he ended up apologising to the house, in tears.</p> <p>Harper clamped down hard on senior officials whose job was to monitor the behaviour of the state. A report by the auditor general found that defence officials had misled ministers and parliament, and whitewashed cost overruns and delays in a determined effort to ensure Canada purchased the F-35 jet. Kevin Page, parliamentary budget officer, reported experiencing \u201csignificant amounts of intimidation\u201d and that his office budget was cut by 30%. Linda Keen, head of Canada\u2019s Nuclear Safety Commission, challenged Harper over the safety of the Chalk River nuclear site: she was denounced and sacked. Peter Tinsley, chair of the Military Police Complaints Commission, attempted to investigate the torture of Taliban prisoners who had been detained by Canadian forces: he lost his job. Beverley McLachlin, chief justice of the supreme court, blocked Harper\u2019s choice for a new high court judge: she was denounced in terms which caused a wave of complaint that Harper was interfering in the independence of the judiciary. </p> <p>* * *</p> <p><strong>As Harper launched his election campaign</strong> 10 weeks ago, he faced the tricky coincidence that one of his closest allies, Senator Mike Duffy, was sitting in court in Ottawa, charged with fraud. The trial is not yet finished, and Duffy has pleaded not guilty, but, whatever the outcome, the case has exposed in embarrassing detail the behaviour of the core of Team Harper \u2013 the Prime Minister\u2019s Office (PMO), which has been <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/editorials/ottawas-accountability-problems-start-at-the-top-in-the-pmo-2/article26086177/\">described eloquently by the Globe and Mail</a> as \u201ca 90-person juggernaut of political strategists, \u2018issues managers\u2019 and party enforcers who exercise strict control over cabinet, the houses of parliament and the bureaucracy.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"092db6acfc4ad82fc167eecb67ea4edd63b461aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/092db6acfc4ad82fc167eecb67ea4edd63b461aa/0_66_2704_1621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mike Duffy arrives at court in Ottawa last April.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"599\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mike Duffy arrives at court in Ottawa last April.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Canadian Press/REX Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Duffy has been an Ottawa character for years, famous as a TV journalist and notorious for his Conservative bent, which paid off in January 2009 when Harper appointed him as a senator for the small eastern province of Prince Edward Island.</p> <p>It was nearly four years later, in December 2012, when a diligent journalist, <a href=\"http://www.ottawacitizen.com/business/Senator+Mike+Duffy+claims+living+allowances+despite+being+Ottawa+resident+since+1970s/7645424/story.html\">Glen McGregor of the Ottawa Citizen</a>, reported that Duffy had told Senate authorities that his cottage in Prince Edward Island was his real home and had been claiming public money for the expense of living in Ottawa. The Senate\u2019s internal economy committee hired a firm of auditors, Deloitte, to check the housing claims of all senators, including Duffy. When the PMO realised that Duffy might be tempted to talk to his old friends in the press, it aimed \u2013 as an internal email put it \u2013 \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/pmo-urged-changes-to-duffy-audit-rcmp-officers-say/article24296238/\">to prevent him from going squirrely in a bunch of weekend panel shows.</a>\u201d</p> <p>Harper\u2019s then chief of staff, Nigel Wright, persuaded the Conservative Party Fund, which is partly funded by the taxpayer, to stump up $32,000 to pay off Duffy\u2019s debt for him, although the troubled senator would be allowed to pretend that he was repaying the money himself. Since, as his own emails disclosed, Wright thought it was \u201cmorally wrong\u201d that the senator had taken the money, this looked rather like an attempt to use taxpayers\u2019 money to repay money that had been taken from the taxpayer. In the event, it turned out that Duffy owed much more. With Duffy pleading poverty, Wright quietly paid the $90,100 himself. (He had made millions in the world of finance before joining Team Harper.)</p> <p>Duffy managed to keep his seat until a second diligent journalist, Robert Fife of CTV, disclosed that it was Wright who had paid Duffy\u2019s debt and that the Senate\u2019s report had been \u201csanitised\u201d. In an avalanche of embarrassment, Mike Duffy was dumped by the Conservatives and charged by the police; Wright resigned, and Stephen Harper denied knowing anything about the cover-up. At the end of May, an Ipsos-Reid poll suggested that only 13% of Canadians believed him.</p> <p>Harper\u2019s leadership style is all about control \u2013 of information and of people. In 2010, Harper provoked fury by cancelling the national census and then scrapping a series of long-term surveys, thus effectively concealing the facts about significant trends in Canadian society, including poverty, inequality, housing need and health. In a report in March, the information commissioner, Suzanne Legault, complained that Canada\u2019s Access to Information law \u201cis applied to encourage a culture of delay \u2026 to deny disclosure. It acts as a shield against disclosure. The interests of the government trump the interests of the public.\u201d</p> <h2>* * * </h2> <p><strong>The Harper government\u2019s obsession with control </strong>may look simply like a means to maintain power. But it can achieve something more important, to reverse the flow of influence: instead of government responding to people, the electorate become passive recipients of state decisions. Consider the case of climate change.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8e2ace0d277794a0ff81c14f602aa6b612c9141b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e2ace0d277794a0ff81c14f602aa6b612c9141b/0_0_5760_3457/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Suncore Oil Sands field near tin Northern Alberta.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Suncore oil sands field near tin Northern Alberta.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Harper has never made any secret of his support for the oil industry. Emerging from his formative years in Alberta, he was a founder member of the neoconservative Reform party, which was baptised with a $100,000 cheque from the head of Gold Standard Oils. Soon after taking power in 2006, Harper started to clamp down on research into global warming. He got rid of his own science adviser and killed the climate-change section of the Department of Foreign Affairs. He shut down the official website on climate change and tried to cut funding for the Polar Environment Atmosphere Research Laboratory, which had been at the forefront of monitoring deterioration in the ozone layer as well as climate change.</p> <p>But he opened his door to the other side of the argument. The Polaris Institute thinktank reported in December 2012 that 45 oil lobbyists had been allowed to work inside Harper\u2019s government and that during the previous four and a half years, officials and ministers had held some 2,700 meetings with the oil lobby. By contrast, the Climate Action Network had managed just six.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>Soon after taking power in 2006, Harper started to clamp down on research into global warming</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Having changed the flow of information into government, he then dramatically changed the direction outwards to his electorate. A new protocol required all government scientists to ask for clearance from the PMO before speaking publicly. As a result, important research has been buried, stalled or misrepresented, including an analysis of changes in snowfall, an inquiry into the loss of ozone over the Arctic, and research on the impact of a 2C rise in global temperature. Meanwhile, the government department that oversees the oil and gas industries increased its advertising budget from less than $250,000 in 2010 to a massive $40m only two years later.</p> <p>Activists, too, felt the rough hand of government. Harper set aside $8m to check the activity of charities, including environmental groups, to stop them campaigning politically. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/david-suzuki\">David Suzuki</a>, the Gandalf-like founding father of the Canadian green movement, stepped down from his own charitable foundation so that he could speak freely without the organisation being attacked. In British Columbia, a green group called Dogwood Initiative, reported that material that it had obtained under the Access to Information law <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/bc-lawyer-gagged-from-discussing-hearing-into-alleged-csis-spying-on-pipeline-protesters/article25964858/\">revealed that it had been</a> under \u201cillegal surveillance\u201d by the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS).</p> <p>Having distorted the flow of information, Harper then moulded the policy to fit. Ever since he first took power in February 2006, he has been promising action on climate change, particularly in relation to the carbon that is released from Canada\u2019s huge reserve of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/oil-sands\">tar sands</a>, now the third-biggest reservoir of oil on the planet.</p> <p>After a false start in 2006 with a bill that was killed by parliament for being too weak, he launched a sleek new vehicle \u2013 \u201cTurning the Corner\u201d \u2013 in March 2007, with new emissions targets for each sector of the economy, crucially including oil and gas. It could all come in to force as early as 2010, he said. But the sleek new vehicle was soon diverted into the oil lobby\u2019s bog, where it stalled and stuck in endless negotiation. At one point, in February 2013, Harper\u2019s environment secretary, Peter Kent, said the rules were \u201cvery close\u201d to being finalised. Four months later, Kent was out of the job, later reflecting ruefully that perhaps he had been \u201cpushing too hard\u201d. To this day, Canada still has no emissions rules for its oil and gas sector.</p> <p>In the background, Harper\u2019s government announced a \u201ccap and trade\u201d system to cut emissions in 2008, then dropped the plan in 2011. It failed to hit the targets that it had agreed at the Copenhagen summit in 2009, scrapped a raft of environmental rules, and, in 2011, became the first government to back out of the Kyoto protocol, which the Liberals had ratified in 2002. When the Centre for Global Development, in 2013, ranked 27 developed nations according to their handling of the environment, it placed Canada at number 27.</p> <h2>* * * </h2> <p><strong>Canada\u2019s current election campaign</strong> has followed a path that is now familiar. The Conservatives have more money. Harper has stopped public funding for political parties, which yields a financial advantage to his own party, with its Cims database full of potential private donors. In a neat symbol of its purchasing power, the Conservative party <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/thenational/are-the-conservatives-buying-facebook-likes-1.3229782\">has been accused of buying likes on Facebook</a> (it declined to comment, saying it was an \u201cinternal party matter\u201d).<strong> </strong>His team have restricted the flow of information to voters: the prime minister makes speeches and holds photocalls but avoids questions from the press. With few exceptions, Conservative candidates have been told not to take part in public debates. Big issues are raised, but it is the small issues that dominate. Canada\u2019s most idolised hockey player, Wayne Gretzky, may not be a political thinker, but his endorsement of Harper made big headlines. The collapse in the price of oil may have driven the Canadian economy into recession, but Harper is microtargeting market segments by offering a new tax break for home renovations and for those who belong to organisations such as the Rotary Club.</p> <p>At a point when the party was slipping backwards in the polls, Harper\u2019s team came up with a brilliantly successful wedge issue, insisting that no Muslim woman should be allowed to take the oath of Canadian citizenship while <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/01/zunera-ishaq-veil-canada-election-conservatives\">wearing a niqab</a>. In the past four years, the number of women who wanted to wear the niqab while taking the oath has reached a grand total of two. But this became a big issue as it split off two sections of voters in Harper\u2019s favour: the \u201cold stock\u201d Canadians, who fear Muslim migrants as intruders, and liberal feminists, to whom one of Harper\u2019s ministers appealed by describing the niqab as \u201ca medieval tribal custom that treats women as property rather than people\u201d. For speaking up in favour of a Muslim woman\u2019s right to choose what she wears, the leader of the centre-left New Democratic party, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/07/tom-mulcair-and-canadas-progressive-democrats-lead-push-for-change\">Tom Mulcair, was punished</a> with a disastrous collapse in his poll ratings, while Harper surged upwards.</p> <p>Harper has the natural advantage of an opposition which is divided between Mulcair\u2019s NDP and Justin Trudeau\u2019s Liberals. He also has the advantage of what looks like a form of voter suppression which, unlike robocalls, is legal \u2013 a requirement that voters produce an official document in addition to their voter card to prove that they have a home in the riding. Harry Neufeld, who has been running elections in Canada since 1982, said he estimated that at least 250,000 qualified electors would be denied a vote. These are likely to be people who would not vote Conservative \u2013 students, the poor, aboriginal people. \u201cI believe the legal changes amount to systematic manipulation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt saddens me to see this happening in Canada. It reduces the perceived integrity of our national elections. And it damages our reputation as a country with deep democratic values.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Additional research by Mali Ilse Paquin</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnlongread\">@gdnlongread</a>, or sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/jul/20/sign-up-to-the-long-read-email\">here</a></p> <p><strong>Nick Davies</strong> is the bestselling author of Flat Earth News, on falsehood and distortion in the media, and a former Journalist of the Year.

          "bodyText": "An unkind cartoon this summer showed the Canadian prime minister, Stephen Harper, kneeling before the statue of another politician, asking: \u201cWhat now, O Great One?\u201d That in itself would not be unkind. The punchline is that the statue is clearly labelled as that of Richard Nixon, famed above all for his attempts to corrupt democracy. As Harper tries for a fourth term in office at the Canadian federal election next week, he is trailed by an extraordinarily long list of allegations. In the Watergate scandal, all the president\u2019s men were accused primarily of breaking the law to get Nixon a second term in the White House. In Canada, some of the prime minister\u2019s men and women have been accused not simply of cheating to win elections but of conspiring to jam the machinery of democratic government. Some of these allegations have been proved. In the 11 years since he became leader of the country\u2019s Conservatives, the party has been fined for breaking electoral rules, and various members of Team Harper have been caught misleading parliament, gagging civil servants, subverting parliamentary committees, gagging scientists, harassing the supreme court, gagging diplomats, lying to the public, concealing evidence of potential crime, spying on opponents, bullying and smearing. Harper personally has earned himself the rare rebuke of being found to be in contempt of his parliament. One of his many biographers, John Ibbitson of the Globe and Mail newspaper, who is more sympathetic than most, concludes: \u201cNo prime minister in history and no political party have been loathed as intensely as Stephen Harper and the Conservative party.\u201d Yet this deeply unpopular politician has won three elections in the last nine years. Although the Liberals are showing a late lead in the polls, Harper\u2019s emphasis on his record on security and the economy may yet put a fourth in his trophy cabinet next week. That is what makes Harper\u2019s politics interesting, that he has perfected the tactics of taking and holding power \u2013 in spite of the demands of democracy. His people have been caught out more often than most. That may be because they are more brazen than most (and because they have some particularly feisty investigative reporters on their patch). But, at heart, Harper\u2019s team are not that different from politicians across the developed world who have discovered that democracy is a pretty sweet theory but that, in reality, if you want to get hold of power and use it, there are all kinds of devious moves available that have very little to do with that antique idea. * * * Start with the business of winning an election. During Harper\u2019s first successful run, back in January 2006, his party bumped up against the limit that it was allowed to spend in its national campaign \u2013 18.3m Canadian dollars ($9.15m). But it still had money in the bank, and the race was very tight. So it channelled more than $1m down to 67 local candidates who had their own budgets and who then paid for a blitz of TV advertising during the final fortnight of the campaign. Harper squeaked home with 21 more seats than the liberals, and managed to form a minority government with 36% of the vote. Some of the local Conservatives were worried that this was illegal, but Harper\u2019s national director dismissed them with contempt. \u201cWhat a bunch of turds,\u201d he emailed. The national officials evidently had persuaded themselves that they had the law on their side. Elections Canada, the official body that enforces polling law, disagreed. As one of its investigators put it: \u201cYou could argue that they stole the election.\u201d Team Harper duly suffered the indignity of police raiding their headquarters in Ottawa, seizing their computers and paperwork, and the further embarrassment of having four senior officials charged with criminal offences. The Conservatives fought Elections Canada to the last ditch, repeatedly challenging it in the courts. Finally, the prosecution accepted a plea bargain. The charges against the four officials were dropped, while the party as an organisation pleaded guilty to illegal campaign spending and paid $282,000 in fines and restitution. That was in March 2012, more than six years after the offence, by which time this particular scandal had cobwebs on it, and Harper had won two more elections, in November 2008 and May 2011. If the path to electoral crime is rarely trodden, there is a close alternative, what Nixon\u2019s people called \u201cratfucking\u201d \u2013 acts of sabotage to damage an opponent. Not exactly criminal. Not always. So, for example, when the current Liberal leader, Justin Trudeau (son of the former prime minister, Pierre) held an open-air press conference in Ottawa, he found himself being heckled by a group of young protesters waving placards. They were later revealed by the Huffington Post to be interns working for the Prime Minister\u2019s Office. In the fortnight before polling day in 2011, Liberal supporters started receiving nuisance calls from people who claimed to be Liberal party workers \u2013 calling Jewish voters on the sabbath, waking up others in the middle of the night. Liberals said this was Conservatives trying to alienate their support. Then, in the final three days before the vote, Elections Canada received a series of complaints about \u201crobocalls\u201d \u2013 recorded messages sent by automatic dialling \u2013 that told voters quite falsely that their polling station had been moved. By election day, anxiety was rising among officials, as internal emails recorded: \u201cIt seems that Conservative candidates are pretending that Elections Canada or returning officers have changed the polling stations \u2026 They have actually disrupted the voting process \u2026 It\u2019s right across the country except Saskatchewan \u2026 It appears it is getting worse.\u201d This looked like a national campaign to suppress the Liberal vote by scattering it away from the polling booths. Some of those voters told the Guardian that they had first received a call from the Conservatives asking how they planned to vote. Sandra McEwing, a stage manager from Winnipeg, said: \u201cMy answer was unequivocal, like, \u2018Go fuck yourself.\u2019 I hung up after that.\u201d Others say they gave similar replies. All then say they received robocalls or live calls, sending them to a polling station that did not exist or to a distant one where they had no right to vote. Some of these voters were in ridings, or electoral districts, where the eventual margin of victory was tiny. Bill Hagborn, president of the Liberal association in a riding in Ontario, told of a bus full of aboriginal voters, who were very unlikely to vote Conservative, and who were misdirected by calls and ended up not voting at all. That riding \u2013 Nipissing-Timiskaming \u2013 went to the Conservatives with a majority of only 18. With Team Harper back in power, a group of voters from six ridings went to federal court to challenge the results of the election. After a seven-day hearing, the trial judge, Mr Justice Mosley, issued a devastating verdict: \u201cI am satisfied that it has been established that misleading calls about the locations of polling stations were made to electors in ridings across the country and that the purpose of those calls was to suppress the votes of electors who had indicated their preference in response to earlier voter-identification calls.\u201d The judge declined to order new elections \u2013 the evidence did not reveal whether the calls had actually swung the result \u2013 but the declaration of national fraud was powerful stuff. And perhaps even more serious, he found that \u201cthe most likely source\u201d of the phone numbers that had been used was the Conservative party\u2019s central database, the Constituent Information Management System (Cims), which is believed to hold the names and addresses of every voter in Canada, together with profiling information that has been gathered by party workers or bought from commercial data-gatherers. The judge specifically avoided identifying the Conservative party as a whole, or its candidates, as having organised the fraud. However, he went on to complain that it had \u201cengaged in trench warfare in an effort to prevent this case from coming to a hearing on the merits\u201d, which had included \u201ctransparent attempts to derail this case\u201d. Meanwhile, Elections Canada had been investigating. Spurred on by news coverage, voters from 261 of the 308 ridings filed complaints about calls that either caused nuisance or misled them about their polling station. The investigators struggled. When they tried to get records of phone numbers that had called the complainants, they failed in 92.5% of cases. With the 7.5% where they succeeded, they then failed to find the owners of 40% of the phone numbers they had identified, including many that were registered across the border in the US. \u201cWe were running into brick walls all over the place,\u201d as one investigator put it. With one startling exception. In relation to the riding of Guelph in Ontario, the Conservatives who had engaged in \u201ctrench warfare\u201d to impede the civil court, handed Elections Canada a group of witnesses who identified an ambitious young party worker, Michael Sona, as a culprit, adding crucially that he had acted without authority, as a \u201crogue activist\u201d. Sona\u2019s name was rapidly leaked to newspapers. Investigators were able to follow a trail of electronic footprints from the local Conservative office, where Sona worked, to a telemarketing company that had sent out a robocall to more than 7,000 Liberal households, diverting them from their polling stations. Sona was arrested, prosecuted and jailed for nine months for interfering with an election. He says that he is innocent, a decoy thrown out to protect the real culprits. Others say he is a maverick who set up his own relatively clumsy scheme without the blessing of his party. But what about all the other ridings? Elections Canada in April 2014 published a report in which it acknowledged the difficulties it had encountered, and reported that \u2013 with the exception of Guelph \u2013 that it had been unable to find any concrete evidence of dubious activity. This left open the possibility that voters in these ridings had been victims of something far more sophisticated than the clumsy operation for which Michael Sona had been blamed. In Ottawa today, political insiders claim to have heard Conservative workers boasting of using call centres in the US, India or the Philippines. However, they can prove nothing, and Elections Canada not only found no such clues but enraged Harper\u2019s opponents by concluding that its inability to find evidence of activity outside Guelph amounted to positive evidence that there had been no such activity. This contradicted the finding of Mr Justice Mosley and implied that all of the complainants from outside Guelph had been tainted by confusion, delusion or dishonesty. No culprit other than Michael Sona has been brought to book. Effectively cleared of responsibility, the Conservatives pushed back hard. When Elections Canada asked for more powers to help it investigate future fraud claims, the House of Commons backed them. The Harper government, however, denied the body the powers it wanted and removed its entire investigations branch, transferring it to the office of the public prosecutor, where it is no longer answerable to parliament. Meanwhile, the Conservative MP who had acted as Harper\u2019s spokesman on the robocalls affair \u2013 his parliamentary secretary, Dean Del Mastro \u2013 was jailed for breaking spending limits in his own riding and submitting false records. The sentencing judge told him that he had indulged in \u201cthe antithesis of democracy\u201d. * * * Stephen Harper has not been convicted of any crime. But his character appears to have had a big impact on the way that his team behaves. He is a loner \u2013 a suburban boy who went trainspotting with his dad; whose asthma stopped him playing ice hockey but who knew more hockey stats than anyone else; who became an economist while his two brothers became accountants because, as he said, he did not have the personality to be an accountant. He was a loner who learned to scorn the happy crowd. One of his biographers, Lawrence Martin, found a source who remembered the young Harper at social events in his 20s as \u201cthe guy in the corner, pen and paper in pocket, looking at us in a condescending way. It was like \u2018Those kids! There they are, drinking again.\u2019\u201d That scorn appears to have interrupted the clever student\u2019s journey to the top of the class. In his first term at university in Toronto, in 1978, he alarmed his family by dropping out, apparently because he could not stand his classmates and their sense of entitlement. He went west to Alberta, which is like leaving New York to go to Texas \u2013 from the bright lights of the city to the oil and gas fields that keep those lights burning; from money and privilege to hard graft and resentment; from progressive to conservative. He worked for three years as a clerk at Imperial Oil before returning to university, this time in Calgary, Alberta. It was 1981. The university was infused with anger at the Liberal prime minister Pierre Trudeau\u2019s plans to suppress the price of Alberta\u2019s oil and to tax it for the benefit of the rest of Canada. That hostility to the progressive elite may have struck a personal chord with the young man who felt he did not fit in to Toronto society. It found intellectual shape in Calgary in the rightwing theories of Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman, which were already being turned into reality by the governments of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan. Harper left university in 1984 and spent the next 20 years working his way upwards and rightwards through Canadian politics, first as an aide for the ruling Progressive Conservatives, then as an MP for the even more conservative Reform party. He quit to become vice president of the National Citizens Coalition, which lobbied for neoconservative causes. Finally, in March 2002, he became leader of the new Alliance party, which was scooping up the anti-tax, anti-union vote. By now the mainstream Progressive Conservatives were in an electoral wasteland. Harper engineered a merger and, in March 2004, aged 44, he became the leader of a new and distinctly rightwing Conservative party. He had shown himself to be unusually smart, enormously hard-working, relentless. He had also attracted the words that were to follow him: cold, aloof, ruthless. And angry. John Ibbitson records a story from an aide who saw Harper exploding on his campaign bus during the June 2004 election, which he lost: \u201cIt was: \u2018We are fucking going to do this, and you are fucking going to do that, and I want to see this fucking thing done right now.\u2019 And then he paused and asked: \u2018And why does nothing happen around here unless I say \u2018fuck\u2019?\u201d Harper is a master tactician. Knowing that there is a block of rightwing voters who have nowhere else to go, he has been willing to defy them in search of wider support: adopting liberal positions on abortion and gay marriage; veering leftwards to pump public money into the economy to avoid recession in 2008; reaching out to the migrants who now fill the suburbs of traditionally Liberal cities such as Toronto. He studies the stats. He makes the numbers add up. Harper has his roots in the same ideological soil as Thatcher and Reagan: cutting tax and rolling back the state; tough on crime and even tougher on the unions; boosting families and national pride; a solid economy that rewards those who work hard. And then there were the tactics that were to attract such notoriety. They reflected the man\u2019s character \u2013 clever and harsh \u2013 moves that turned a democratic election into a mere sequence of manoeuvres. He learned from the master, Arthur Finkelstein, who had played the electoral game for Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan. One of Harper\u2019s early allies from the 1990s, Gerry Nicholls, captured in his memoirs the special cynicism of Finkelstein\u2019s will to manipulate the electorate in his dictum: \u201cWe have to convince Canadians to drink pig\u2019s piss.\u201d This meant, first of all, spending very little time on the big questions about the economy or public services or the environment and turning instead to an arsenal of aggression: attack ads to smear the opposition, like the one that focused on a Liberal leader\u2019s facial disfigurement, caused by Bell\u2019s palsy, or one that featured a puffin shitting on another Liberal leader\u2019s shoulder. He also exploited \u201cwedge\u201d issues that aim to alienate a section of the opposition support, such as demanding the closure of the unit where heroin addicts in Vancouver can get safe injections. It meant money \u2013 millions in private donations to fund the campaign, and millions more in state giveaways in order to encourage the voters. Just as Margaret Thatcher cut income tax to make Tory voting pay, so Harper gave his electorate a high-profile gift when he first took power in 2006, by cutting the Canadian sales tax, GST. It cost the exchequer some $12bn, but it purchased popularity. At times, it meant descending into old-fashioned, US-style pork-barrel politics, pouring public money into ridings that were politically important. An investigation by the Globe and Mail this year found that 83% of the Harper government\u2019s new infrastructure projects had gone to the 52% of ridings that were in Conservative hands. And it meant investing heavily in the politically profitable new science of microtargeting. This was the original reason for the Conservatives creating the Cims database, in which was stored every conceivable item of intelligence about voters. Other parties have since caught up, but at that time it allowed the Conservative party to target the \u201cmarket segments\u201d it needed for victory \u2013 not just with policy, but with favours. A $500 tax break for children to do ballet or hockey in the 2006 budget was good for a middle-class segment (this was doubled in 2014). A break for tradespeople\u2019s tools could buy another. The Canadian writer Susan Delacourt, who tracked this in her book, Shopping For Votes, told of the finding in the Cims database that people who owned snowmobiles were potential Conservative voters. The Harper government has pledged $35m to create new trails for snowmobiles. These tactics have proved particularly effective in a world in which people are becoming alienated from politics itself. In Canada, nearly 40% of the electorate did not bother to vote at the 2011 election. Among voters under 24, more than 60% stayed away (compared with 35.3% in 2006). A poll in Quebec province two months ago found that as the federal election campaign was launched, 20% of respondents could not name the political party that was running the country. Delacourt cites one of Harper\u2019s political marketers, Patrick Muttart, saying that much of Conservative activity was aimed at voters who paid no attention to politics and who needed messages that were \u201cbrutally simple\u201d. In power as in elections, Harper\u2019s rule has been to keep winning, whatever it takes. Even parliament \u2013 the embodiment of the popular will \u2013 is merely an obstacle to be dealt with. Soon after the November 2008 election, as he began his second minority government, Harper launched an \u201comnibus bill\u201d, which contained so many provocative proposals that he united the previously divided opposition parties, which decided not just to vote against the bill but to form a coalition that could replace his government. Harper didn\u2019t want that. So he prorogued parliament. He needed the consent of the Queen\u2019s representative, the governor general, to do so. He got it. And so the parliament that threatened him was simply suspended until the political storm passed. A year later, Harper was in deep trouble again, over press reports that Canadian soldiers in Afghanistan had handed over Taliban prisoners to local security forces, who had then tortured them. Harper\u2019s government had denied the claims, which amounted to allegations of war crime, but it was caught out badly in November 2009 when a Canadian diplomat and a general separately went public with evidence that parts of the government had known about this for more than three years. When the opposition united once more to demand the release of paperwork on the subject, Harper refused \u2026 and then persuaded the governor general to prorogue parliament again. There was a chorus of protest, led by professors of law and politics, but Harper scorned them. The elected representatives of the people were simply locked out for three months. The following year, Harper clashed again with the rights of parliament. In July 2010, he announced that his government would buy 65 F-35 fighter jets, costing a total of $15bn \u2013 the most expensive military purchase in Canadian history. The new Liberal leader, Michael Ignatieff, reckoned the real price would be even higher and accused Harper of deliberately understating it. Harper refused to hand over the paperwork that would disclose the truth about the F-35s and about the cost of a clutch of other policies. In March 2011, the speaker of the House of Commons ruled that this was a contempt of parliament, and the House then passed a vote of no confidence in Harper\u2019s government. There was an election (involving the robocalls), which Harper won. Ignatieff quit. And 11 months later, it emerged that the true cost of the F-35s was nearly twice what Harper had claimed. In 2007, his second year in office, the National Post disclosed that Team Harper had drawn up a guidebook for the Conservative chairs of parliamentary committees, advising them how to use delays, obstruction and confusion to block difficult inquiries. In opposition, Harper said he would reform the Senate, so that its members would be elected. In office, he changed his mind, kept the power to select them himself and appointed 59 new senators so that he had a built-in majority in the upper house. The House of Commons found itself being swamped with omnibus bills, which included dozens of contentious proposals that could not be properly debated in the time available. At the daily Question Period, when ministers traditionally provide information, Harper\u2019s parliamentary secretary, Paul Calandra, gave answers so obstructive that, after a volley of complaint, he ended up apologising to the house, in tears. Harper clamped down hard on senior officials whose job was to monitor the behaviour of the state. A report by the auditor general found that defence officials had misled ministers and parliament, and whitewashed cost overruns and delays in a determined effort to ensure Canada purchased the F-35 jet. Kevin Page, parliamentary budget officer, reported experiencing \u201csignificant amounts of intimidation\u201d and that his office budget was cut by 30%. Linda Keen, head of Canada\u2019s Nuclear Safety Commission, challenged Harper over the safety of the Chalk River nuclear site: she was denounced and sacked. Peter Tinsley, chair of the Military Police Complaints Commission, attempted to investigate the torture of Taliban prisoners who had been detained by Canadian forces: he lost his job. Beverley McLachlin, chief justice of the supreme court, blocked Harper\u2019s choice for a new high court judge: she was denounced in terms which caused a wave of complaint that Harper was interfering in the independence of the judiciary. * * * As Harper launched his election campaign 10 weeks ago, he faced the tricky coincidence that one of his closest allies, Senator Mike Duffy, was sitting in court in Ottawa, charged with fraud. The trial is not yet finished, and Duffy has pleaded not guilty, but, whatever the outcome, the case has exposed in embarrassing detail the behaviour of the core of Team Harper \u2013 the Prime Minister\u2019s Office (PMO), which has been described eloquently by the Globe and Mail as \u201ca 90-person juggernaut of political strategists, \u2018issues managers\u2019 and party enforcers who exercise strict control over cabinet, the houses of parliament and the bureaucracy.\u201d Duffy has been an Ottawa character for years, famous as a TV journalist and notorious for his Conservative bent, which paid off in January 2009 when Harper appointed him as a senator for the small eastern province of Prince Edward Island. It was nearly four years later, in December 2012, when a diligent journalist, Glen McGregor of the Ottawa Citizen, reported that Duffy had told Senate authorities that his cottage in Prince Edward Island was his real home and had been claiming public money for the expense of living in Ottawa. The Senate\u2019s internal economy committee hired a firm of auditors, Deloitte, to check the housing claims of all senators, including Duffy. When the PMO realised that Duffy might be tempted to talk to his old friends in the press, it aimed \u2013 as an internal email put it \u2013 \u201cto prevent him from going squirrely in a bunch of weekend panel shows.\u201d Harper\u2019s then chief of staff, Nigel Wright, persuaded the Conservative Party Fund, which is partly funded by the taxpayer, to stump up $32,000 to pay off Duffy\u2019s debt for him, although the troubled senator would be allowed to pretend that he was repaying the money himself. Since, as his own emails disclosed, Wright thought it was \u201cmorally wrong\u201d that the senator had taken the money, this looked rather like an attempt to use taxpayers\u2019 money to repay money that had been taken from the taxpayer. In the event, it turned out that Duffy owed much more. With Duffy pleading poverty, Wright quietly paid the $90,100 himself. (He had made millions in the world of finance before joining Team Harper.) Duffy managed to keep his seat until a second diligent journalist, Robert Fife of CTV, disclosed that it was Wright who had paid Duffy\u2019s debt and that the Senate\u2019s report had been \u201csanitised\u201d. In an avalanche of embarrassment, Mike Duffy was dumped by the Conservatives and charged by the police; Wright resigned, and Stephen Harper denied knowing anything about the cover-up. At the end of May, an Ipsos-Reid poll suggested that only 13% of Canadians believed him. Harper\u2019s leadership style is all about control \u2013 of information and of people. In 2010, Harper provoked fury by cancelling the national census and then scrapping a series of long-term surveys, thus effectively concealing the facts about significant trends in Canadian society, including poverty, inequality, housing need and health. In a report in March, the information commissioner, Suzanne Legault, complained that Canada\u2019s Access to Information law \u201cis applied to encourage a culture of delay \u2026 to deny disclosure. It acts as a shield against disclosure. The interests of the government trump the interests of the public.\u201d * * * The Harper government\u2019s obsession with control may look simply like a means to maintain power. But it can achieve something more important, to reverse the flow of influence: instead of government responding to people, the electorate become passive recipients of state decisions. Consider the case of climate change. Harper has never made any secret of his support for the oil industry. Emerging from his formative years in Alberta, he was a founder member of the neoconservative Reform party, which was baptised with a $100,000 cheque from the head of Gold Standard Oils. Soon after taking power in 2006, Harper started to clamp down on research into global warming. He got rid of his own science adviser and killed the climate-change section of the Department of Foreign Affairs. He shut down the official website on climate change and tried to cut funding for the Polar Environment Atmosphere Research Laboratory, which had been at the forefront of monitoring deterioration in the ozone layer as well as climate change. But he opened his door to the other side of the argument. The Polaris Institute thinktank reported in December 2012 that 45 oil lobbyists had been allowed to work inside Harper\u2019s government and that during the previous four and a half years, officials and ministers had held some 2,700 meetings with the oil lobby. By contrast, the Climate Action Network had managed just six. Having changed the flow of information into government, he then dramatically changed the direction outwards to his electorate. A new protocol required all government scientists to ask for clearance from the PMO before speaking publicly. As a result, important research has been buried, stalled or misrepresented, including an analysis of changes in snowfall, an inquiry into the loss of ozone over the Arctic, and research on the impact of a 2C rise in global temperature. Meanwhile, the government department that oversees the oil and gas industries increased its advertising budget from less than $250,000 in 2010 to a massive $40m only two years later. Activists, too, felt the rough hand of government. Harper set aside $8m to check the activity of charities, including environmental groups, to stop them campaigning politically. David Suzuki, the Gandalf-like founding father of the Canadian green movement, stepped down from his own charitable foundation so that he could speak freely without the organisation being attacked. In British Columbia, a green group called Dogwood Initiative, reported that material that it had obtained under the Access to Information law revealed that it had been under \u201cillegal surveillance\u201d by the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS). Having distorted the flow of information, Harper then moulded the policy to fit. Ever since he first took power in February 2006, he has been promising action on climate change, particularly in relation to the carbon that is released from Canada\u2019s huge reserve of tar sands, now the third-biggest reservoir of oil on the planet. After a false start in 2006 with a bill that was killed by parliament for being too weak, he launched a sleek new vehicle \u2013 \u201cTurning the Corner\u201d \u2013 in March 2007, with new emissions targets for each sector of the economy, crucially including oil and gas. It could all come in to force as early as 2010, he said. But the sleek new vehicle was soon diverted into the oil lobby\u2019s bog, where it stalled and stuck in endless negotiation. At one point, in February 2013, Harper\u2019s environment secretary, Peter Kent, said the rules were \u201cvery close\u201d to being finalised. Four months later, Kent was out of the job, later reflecting ruefully that perhaps he had been \u201cpushing too hard\u201d. To this day, Canada still has no emissions rules for its oil and gas sector. In the background, Harper\u2019s government announced a \u201ccap and trade\u201d system to cut emissions in 2008, then dropped the plan in 2011. It failed to hit the targets that it had agreed at the Copenhagen summit in 2009, scrapped a raft of environmental rules, and, in 2011, became the first government to back out of the Kyoto protocol, which the Liberals had ratified in 2002. When the Centre for Global Development, in 2013, ranked 27 developed nations according to their handling of the environment, it placed Canada at number 27. * * * Canada\u2019s current election campaign has followed a path that is now familiar. The Conservatives have more money. Harper has stopped public funding for political parties, which yields a financial advantage to his own party, with its Cims database full of potential private donors. In a neat symbol of its purchasing power, the Conservative party has been accused of buying likes on Facebook (it declined to comment, saying it was an \u201cinternal party matter\u201d). His team have restricted the flow of information to voters: the prime minister makes speeches and holds photocalls but avoids questions from the press. With few exceptions, Conservative candidates have been told not to take part in public debates. Big issues are raised, but it is the small issues that dominate. Canada\u2019s most idolised hockey player, Wayne Gretzky, may not be a political thinker, but his endorsement of Harper made big headlines. The collapse in the price of oil may have driven the Canadian economy into recession, but Harper is microtargeting market segments by offering a new tax break for home renovations and for those who belong to organisations such as the Rotary Club. At a point when the party was slipping backwards in the polls, Harper\u2019s team came up with a brilliantly successful wedge issue, insisting that no Muslim woman should be allowed to take the oath of Canadian citizenship while wearing a niqab. In the past four years, the number of women who wanted to wear the niqab while taking the oath has reached a grand total of two. But this became a big issue as it split off two sections of voters in Harper\u2019s favour: the \u201cold stock\u201d Canadians, who fear Muslim migrants as intruders, and liberal feminists, to whom one of Harper\u2019s ministers appealed by describing the niqab as \u201ca medieval tribal custom that treats women as property rather than people\u201d. For speaking up in favour of a Muslim woman\u2019s right to choose what she wears, the leader of the centre-left New Democratic party, Tom Mulcair, was punished with a disastrous collapse in his poll ratings, while Harper surged upwards. Harper has the natural advantage of an opposition which is divided between Mulcair\u2019s NDP and Justin Trudeau\u2019s Liberals. He also has the advantage of what looks like a form of voter suppression which, unlike robocalls, is legal \u2013 a requirement that voters produce an official document in addition to their voter card to prove that they have a home in the riding. Harry Neufeld, who has been running elections in Canada since 1982, said he estimated that at least 250,000 qualified electors would be denied a vote. These are likely to be people who would not vote Conservative \u2013 students, the poor, aboriginal people. \u201cI believe the legal changes amount to systematic manipulation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt saddens me to see this happening in Canada. It reduces the perceived integrity of our national elections. And it damages our reputation as a country with deep democratic values.\u201d Additional research by Mali Ilse Paquin \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here Nick Davies is the bestselling author of Flat Earth News, on falsehood and distortion in the media, and a former Journalist of the Year.

He likes being in charge, but barely tolerates the things you have to do to win the job. He\u2019s enjoyed the good fortune of a divided left, weak competitors and a perpetually unsettled economy.

There are many things to be afraid of, from the global economy to your <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/05/not-just-america-canadian-politicians-islamophobia-gains-polls\" title=\"\">Muslim neighbour</a>, and only I will protect you against these threats.\u201d</p> <p>It is a narrow vision aimed at cajoling one more trip to the ballot box from a narrow (37%\u201340%) proportion of voters.

          "bodyText": "Here in Canada, most voters hug the centre line, preferring red (aka \u201cprogressive\u201d) Conservatives or fiscally prudent Liberals. About 25% of us say we are left of centre, 20% right, and the rest are proud centrists. As this 42nd general election enters its final days, the incumbent Conservatives are on their feet, but staggering. If they manage an almost unprecedented fourth consecutive win, it will be because many young Canadians that want to be rid of them didn\u2019t show up on election day. This is not, and has never been, a particularly popular government. Stephen Harper is not much of a \u201cfront of the house\u201d man. He likes being in charge, but barely tolerates the things you have to do to win the job. He\u2019s enjoyed the good fortune of a divided left, weak competitors and a perpetually unsettled economy. On the scorecard, he looks like a political superstar. On the hustings, though, he\u2019s a plodder. Harper\u2019s pitch in 2015 is halfhearted, and only half-working. To paraphrase: \u201cYou may not like me, but the other fellows are worse. I may not have big plans for the country, but I\u2019ll cut your taxes. There are many things to be afraid of, from the global economy to your Muslim neighbour, and only I will protect you against these threats.\u201d It is a narrow vision aimed at cajoling one more trip to the ballot box from a narrow (37%\u201340%) proportion of voters. His strategists have always made clear that they are not interested in mass appeal or accommodation, preferring a smaller and more highly motivated target group. Along the way, Harper has alienated progressive Conservatives and driven other progressive voters to levels of outrage rarely seen. Three out of four voters want change, and one in two crave it badly. Canada\u2019s usual third party, the socialist-oriented New Democrats, had an unprecedented opportunity to win this election, and have wasted it. Finishing second in the last election with a popular leader named Jack Layton, they\u2019ve served as official opposition for four years. The current leader Thomas Mulcair was masterful and full of brimstone in the House of Commons but has turned out to be a disappointing campaigner. His style suggests a cranky uncle more than a firebrand for the oppressed. Mulcair saddled himself with a platform that is heavy on policy trinkets (think restoring home delivery of snail mail), and is more fiscally prudent than political prudence would recommend. In a country with a balanced budget, and a low debt-to-GDP ratio, Mulcair chose to promise balanced budgets as far as the eye could see, in a bid to woo new supporters from the centre of the spectrum. This backfired, badly, when the centrist Liberal leader, Justin Trudeau, promised instead to goose the economy with a few years of modest deficit spending on infrastructure, a position more consonant with mainstream public opinion on the left and in the centre. The NDP under Mulcair has also been cold to new pipelines, hostile to the Trans Pacific Partnership agreement, and wants to hike corporate taxes.

          "bodyText": "A Canadian election campaign that began amid widespread concern over a faltering economy has turned into a national referendum on the rights of immigrants, with the Conservative government of Stephen Harper, the prime minister, gaining support for its hardline stance against Muslim women who veil their faces in public. The so-called \u201cniqab issue\u201d, inspired by the ruling party\u2019s legal campaign to prevent one Pakistani immigrant from veiling her face during the ceremony held to formalise her new citizenship, remains powerfully divisive as Canadians prepare to elect a new government on 19 October. Although polls show that a substantial majority of Canadians support the government position, opponents have denounced it as a dangerous and even \u201cdisgusting\u201d attack on the country\u2019s fragile multicultural harmony. With the latest polls showing Justin Trudeau\u2019s Liberal party gaining ground on the Tories, all attention now turns to the one large bloc of voters who have yet to signal their intentions: the hundreds of thousands of immigrants concentrated in the 100-mile suburban sprawl surrounding Toronto, the country\u2019s largest city. From the beginning of the campaign, no party doubted the importance of winning these polyglot districts, where more than four out of every 10 citizens \u2013 and in some cases more than half of them \u2013 were born outside the country.

The irony is that a Canadian election campaign dominated by debates over the rights of immigrants is fast becoming a two-way race that will be decided by immigrants \u2013 with no accurate information suggesting which way they will swing. The question is whether the Conservatives\u2019 effort to mobilise their nativist base in the rest of Canada using deliberate expressions of religious intolerance has tarnished their appeal to the immigrant voters about to decide their fate.

          "bodyText": "With just one week to go before the national election, Canada\u2019s Liberal Party is gathering steam, as the country enters the final stretch in what has been the longest election campaign in its modern history. Polls indicate the Liberal party, which despite election losses spanning the past decade has long considered itself to be Canada\u2019s \u201cnatural governing party\u201d , is now within reach of an electoral win. Greg Lyle, a pollster at Innovative Research, said the traditionally centrist party successfully tapped into many of the voters that had abandoned them over the last three elections. The party is now running neck-and-neck with the incumbent Conservative Party, if not slightly ahead according to some polls. \u201cWhat continued for the Liberals, despite poor election results, was that they retained a really strong emotional connection with a large group of Canadians,\u201d Lyle said. \u201cThe job of the Liberals this campaign was to bring those defecting Liberals home.\u201d The Conservative Party, meanwhile, appears to be left increasingly with just the support of their core voter base, roughly 30% of the population. \u201cThe Liberals are fishing from a much, much larger pool than the Tories,\u201d Lyle said. The Liberals are betting that their campaign\u2019s defining message of change will trump the Conservatives, who have been urging voters to \u201cprotect the economy\u201d at all costs, and stay on the course set by their electoral victory in 2006. Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper, currently the longest serving leader in the G7 barring German chancellor Angela Merkel, has tried to persuade voters that a win for either of the opposition parties \u2013 the Liberals or the left-leaning New Democrats \u2013 would threaten Canada\u2019s economy and national security. It is a pitch that resonated with the Grays, a couple who were casting their ballots at the advanced polls Sunday over the long Canadian Thanksgiving weekend \u2013 a holiday celebrated about a month before the American equivalent \u2013 in Milton, Ontario, a fast-growing bedroom community outside Toronto. \u201cWe have a small business and the Conservatives have been been very good for us, tax-wise,\u201d said Dave Gray, 65. Barb Gray, 62, added: \u201cThe biggest thing too is keeping us safe in our country. Keeping a close watch on terrorists trying to get into Canada, that\u2019s a big issue with us. We have to be very careful and I think sometimes the Liberals are a little lax on things like that.\u201d Al Bell, 74, who also said he voted Conservative, put it more succinctly: \u201cI figured, if it\u2019s not broke, don\u2019t fix it.\u201d The Conservatives have also made the niqab \u2013 specifically whether a Muslim woman should be allowed to wear the face-covering veil at Canadian citizenship ceremonies \u2013 one of the defining issues of the campaign, as it sought to capitalize on the hardline stance which has helped it gain in the polls. National polls have indicated a statistical tie between the Conservatives, Liberals and the New Democrats for much of the race. But over the last couple of weeks, pollsters have suggested either an emerging two-way race between the Conservatives and the Liberals, or the Liberals pulling slightly ahead. The New Democrats, who had started the campaign with a lead on the Liberals in key regions of the country, are now trailing in third place. Liberal candidate Navdeep Bains, who is running again after losing his seat in the 2011 federal election after the Conservatives swept the vote, said he sees the progressive vote coalescing back around the Liberals and their youthful leader Justin Trudeau, 43, the son of former Canadian Liberal prime minister Pierre Trudeau. \u201cPeople are not happy with the status quo, they\u2019re not happy with Mr Harper and his divisive politics. They really want change,\u201d Bains said. \u201cThey see that Mr Trudeau and the Liberal Party represent that change.\u201d A Nanos poll published Monday had the Liberals at 35.7% nationally followed by the Conservatives at 28.9%, and the New Democratic Party at 24.3%. Poll aggregator TooCloseToCall has the Liberals at 33.9%, the Conservatives at 33.2% and the New Democrats at 23.3%. Both results point to a likely minority government for whichever party wins when Canadians go to the polls on 19 October.",

In a written statement, Chris Alexander confirmed a report in the Globe and Mail newspaper that Harper\u2019s office had earlier this year told immigration officials to stop processing claims of Syrians referred by the United Nations, declaring they would need the prime minister\u2019s approval to enter Canada.

This was a prudent step to ensure the integrity of our refugee referral system.\u201d Although the statement did not give further details, Harper has repeatedly said refugees need to be screened to prevent potential militants entering Canada disguised as refugees. Harper came under pressure last month to let in more refugees when it emerged that relatives of a Syrian toddler whose drowned body washed up on a Turkish beach had wanted to emigrate to Canada. Critics have long accused Harper and his office of interfering in all aspects of government rather than letting his ministers control their own portfolios, and opponents jumped on the Globe report as another example. \u201cStephen Harper himself prevented the arrival of Syrian families in the midst of the worst humanitarian crisis since world war two ... that is abject behavior on the part of a Canadian prime minister,\u201d said Tom Mulcair, leader of the official opposition New Democrats. A spokesman for the Conservatives did not immediately respond to a request seeking further comment. Opinion polls show Harper is set to lose his majority in the 19 October election and might even be removed from power by the Liberals and New Democrats. \u201cThere are very few people left in this country who are surprised when we hear reports of the prime minister and his office meddling in things in a political and non-transparent way,\u201d Liberal leader Justin Trudeau said on a campaign stop. The Conservative government said in late September that it would speed up the processing of refugee applications to bring thousands Syrians and Iraqis to Canada by the end of the year.

After announcing this month that it would go to the supreme court of Canada to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/16/canada-government-islamic-veil-niqab-ban-citizenship\">appeal its second defeat</a>, the Conservatives moved from third to first place in polls tracking opinion prior to the October election.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not an issue, by the way,\u201d Ishaq told the Guardian. \u201cThis is a trivial thing,\u201d she said, echoing the view of many Canadians. \u201cThis is not the business of the state.\u201d</p> <p>The Canadian department of citizenship and immigration would seem to concur, noting that only two women since 2011 have declined the ceremony because of the ban.</p> <p>But as the Conservatives know, majority public opinion sharply disagrees. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge issue,\u201d said pollster Frank Graves of EKOS Research Associates. \u201cIt\u2019s sorting the electorate right now. It has really invigorated the Conservatives and moved them into a clear lead.\u201d</p> <p>Equally significant, according to Graves, was the advantage the incumbents gained by their refusal to increase Canada\u2019s intake of Syrian refugees in response to the current crisis \u2013 even after the death on a Turkish beach of three-year old Alan Kurdi, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/03/refugee-crisis-syrian-boy-washed-up-on-beach-turkey-trying-to-reach-canada\">whose family was hoping to find safe haven in Canada</a>.</p> <p>Emphasizing the need to maintain military operations against Islamic State insurgents and to keep suspected terrorists out of the country, Harper stiffly rejected widespread demands that he throw the doors open to refugees, as Canada has often done in similar crises in the past.</p> <p>\u201cEverybody thought, \u2018Oh God, the Conservatives fumbled that so badly, they\u2019re done now,\u2019\u2019 Graves said. \u201cBut no, that actually helped them.\u201d</p> <p>The ruling party\u2019s nativist turn has left opposition leaders and progressive citizens gasping with indignation. \u201cCanadians should see right through this as a way to distract from the real issues that affect people\u2019s day to day life,\u201d said Amira Elghawaby of the National Council of Canadian Muslims. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about the economy, we\u2019re talking about the climate, the future for everyone. Whether a woman wants to cover her face for the two minutes it takes to swear her oath is not an issue that should be front and centre in an election.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/10/canada-conservatives-lynton-crosby-election\">Canada election 2015: Tories seek out 'Australian rottweiler' Lynton Crosby</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Most observers attribute Harper\u2019s sudden success with anti-Muslim politics to the mid-campaign arrival of Australian consultant Lynton Crosby to help the flagging Conservative cause. His presence in Canada first became apparent during a debate in which Harper appealed for the votes of what he called \u201cold-stock Canadians\u201d \u2013 a novel phrase that struck a deliberately discordant note in the typically inclusive chorus of Canadian multiculturalism.</p> <p>At the same time, the government launched its latest appeal of the Ishaq niqab case \u2013 a gesture that has little hope of succeeding, according to legal experts. \u201cThere couldn\u2019t be a clearer case of government ministers just whipping up the population when they haven\u2019t got a legal leg to stand on,\u201d University of Toronto law professor Denise R\u00e9aume <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/stephen-harper-on-the-niqab-a-veiled-threat/\">told Maclean\u2019s magazine</a>.</p> <p>But successive polls have forcefully demonstrated that a large majority of Canadians favour the government\u2019s position that a person should show their face during the ceremony, despite having already done so for the purpose of official identification. Harper has denounced the practice of wearing a niqab as \u201ccontrary to our own values\u201d and \u201crooted in a culture that is anti-women\u201d.</p> <p>The Conservative\u2019s anti-Muslim turn has proven especially popular in Quebec, where until recently the government party was in danger of being <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/07/tom-mulcair-and-canadas-progressive-democrats-lead-push-for-change\">swept away by an \u201corange wave\u201d of candidates from the leftist New Democratic Party</a>. Separatists are also riding the counter current with shockingly racist advertisements warning of Muslim peril. One shows a drop of oil <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVE-N-htzKs\">spreading into the form of a sinister black veil</a> beneath the motto, La goutte de trop (a drop too much).</p> <p>Tories elsewhere in the country are also explicitly warning against the alleged threat posed by Syrian refugees.

          "bodyText": "Zunera Ishaq describes her choice to wear a veil in public as a \u201ctrivial and minor issue\u201d. But for 35 million Canadians, this woman\u2019s stubborn insistence on her right to conceal her face has become a central issue in the ongoing election campaign, giving a late boost to a Conservative government that had previously seemed doomed to defeat. A 29-year-old mother and teacher who was accepted as an immigrant to Canada in 2008, Ishaq first came to attention when she went to court to challenge a new government regulation that sought to prevent Muslim women from covering their faces during their citizenship ceremony. She won handily, and won again early this month when a second court rejected the Harper government\u2019s appeal against the earlier decision. But with every victory for Ishaq, the government opposing her becomes more popular. After announcing this month that it would go to the supreme court of Canada to appeal its second defeat, the Conservatives moved from third to first place in polls tracking opinion prior to the October election. \u201cThis is not an issue, by the way,\u201d Ishaq told the Guardian. \u201cThis is a trivial thing,\u201d she said, echoing the view of many Canadians. \u201cThis is not the business of the state.\u201d The Canadian department of citizenship and immigration would seem to concur, noting that only two women since 2011 have declined the ceremony because of the ban. But as the Conservatives know, majority public opinion sharply disagrees. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge issue,\u201d said pollster Frank Graves of EKOS Research Associates. \u201cIt\u2019s sorting the electorate right now. It has really invigorated the Conservatives and moved them into a clear lead.\u201d Equally significant, according to Graves, was the advantage the incumbents gained by their refusal to increase Canada\u2019s intake of Syrian refugees in response to the current crisis \u2013 even after the death on a Turkish beach of three-year old Alan Kurdi, whose family was hoping to find safe haven in Canada. Emphasizing the need to maintain military operations against Islamic State insurgents and to keep suspected terrorists out of the country, Harper stiffly rejected widespread demands that he throw the doors open to refugees, as Canada has often done in similar crises in the past. \u201cEverybody thought, \u2018Oh God, the Conservatives fumbled that so badly, they\u2019re done now,\u2019\u2019 Graves said. \u201cBut no, that actually helped them.\u201d The ruling party\u2019s nativist turn has left opposition leaders and progressive citizens gasping with indignation. \u201cCanadians should see right through this as a way to distract from the real issues that affect people\u2019s day to day life,\u201d said Amira Elghawaby of the National Council of Canadian Muslims. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about the economy, we\u2019re talking about the climate, the future for everyone. Whether a woman wants to cover her face for the two minutes it takes to swear her oath is not an issue that should be front and centre in an election.\u201d Most observers attribute Harper\u2019s sudden success with anti-Muslim politics to the mid-campaign arrival of Australian consultant Lynton Crosby to help the flagging Conservative cause. His presence in Canada first became apparent during a debate in which Harper appealed for the votes of what he called \u201cold-stock Canadians\u201d \u2013 a novel phrase that struck a deliberately discordant note in the typically inclusive chorus of Canadian multiculturalism. At the same time, the government launched its latest appeal of the Ishaq niqab case \u2013 a gesture that has little hope of succeeding, according to legal experts. \u201cThere couldn\u2019t be a clearer case of government ministers just whipping up the population when they haven\u2019t got a legal leg to stand on,\u201d University of Toronto law professor Denise R\u00e9aume told Maclean\u2019s magazine. But successive polls have forcefully demonstrated that a large majority of Canadians favour the government\u2019s position that a person should show their face during the ceremony, despite having already done so for the purpose of official identification. Harper has denounced the practice of wearing a niqab as \u201ccontrary to our own values\u201d and \u201crooted in a culture that is anti-women\u201d. The Conservative\u2019s anti-Muslim turn has proven especially popular in Quebec, where until recently the government party was in danger of being swept away by an \u201corange wave\u201d of candidates from the leftist New Democratic Party. Separatists are also riding the counter current with shockingly racist advertisements warning of Muslim peril. One shows a drop of oil spreading into the form of a sinister black veil beneath the motto, La goutte de trop (a drop too much). Tories elsewhere in the country are also explicitly warning against the alleged threat posed by Syrian refugees. Toronto candidate Joe Daniel claimed that sinister forces are exploiting the crisis to export Islam to and thereby transform western society. Veteran Tory MP Larry Miller, representing rural Ontario, advised women like Ishaq to \u201cstay the hell where you came from\u201d. Hate crimes against Muslims are steadily increasing in Canada, according to Elghawaby, who fears that recent events will lead to an even sharper spike. \u201cEven if the issues are contentious, it\u2019s really important that our political leaders are very cognizant of the impact this divisive discourse can have on people\u2019s real lives,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is dog-whistle politics 101,\u201d Graves said. \u201cAnd you know what? It\u2019s working.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a pretty striking rise in racial intolerance in Canada, which mirrors what\u2019s going on in Europe and America as well,\u201d Graves said. \u201cCanadians have become a little more fearful, a little more closed, a little less enthusiastic about globalization.\u201d For Ishaq, sitting in limbo while the government presses its case against her, the change is startling. \u201cI\u2019m really shocked,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is not the image of Canada I perceived at first.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve learned so much in this country about respecting other people\u2019s opinions,\u201d she added. \u201cBut I can\u2019t understand why people are not trying to understand my opinion as well.\u201d Emulating British practice, the Harper government has also vowed to strip Canadian citizenship from Jordanian-born terrorist Zakaria Amara, currently serving a life sentence for his role in a 2006 bomb plot. \u201cA Canadian is a Canadian is a Canadian,\u201d Liberal Party leader Justin Trudeau told Harper during a recent debate, accusing him of devaluing everybody\u2019s citizenship by making it \u201cconditional for anybody\u201d.

Trudeau repeatedly hammered home a message of economic growth and investment during the debate. Mulcair, whose party stands a chance of forming government in the 19 October election for the first time in its history, tried repeatedly to project a prudent centrist image to allay fears the left-leaning New Democrats would be big government spenders. While the focus was on the economy, some of the biggest fireworks of the night came over the Conservative government\u2019s handling of the Syrian refugee crisis. Harper was forced to defend himself against accusations his government had failed to move quickly on the Syrian refugee crisis. \u201cThese guys would have had us throwing open our borders without any security or any checks,\u201d Harper said, referring to his rivals. \u201cCanadians want a prime minister who has a sense of urgency,\u201d Mulcair responded. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you stop using security as a pretext to do nothing?\u201d The Conservatives recently committed to granting asylum to 10,000 Syrian refugees and have since agreed to bring in an additional 10,000. By August they had managed to resettled about 2,375.",

          "bodyText": "Canada\u2019s prime minister, Stephen Harper, has been forced to defend his government\u2019s record on refugees after it emerged that a Syrian boy whose body ashore in Turkey this week had family in Canada. Shocking images of three-year-old Aylan Kurdi\u2019s s body lying face down in the surf not far from Turkey\u2019s fashionable resort town of Bodrum captured the world\u2019s attention and appeared on the front pages of newspapers worldwide. His older brother Galip, five, and mother also died while trying to reach Europe. Reports that Canada had rejected an asylum application by members of the boy\u2019s family quickly made the tragedy a major issue in the country\u2019s federal election campaign and forced the Conservative leader to change his schedule to address the controversy. In a tearful news conference in British Columbia on Thursday, Aylan\u2019s aunt, Tima Kurdi, described their father Abdullah\u2019s desperate struggle to keep his young sons from drowning after their boat capsized. Seeing Aylan was no longer alive \u201che closed his eyes and let him go\u201d, she said, sobbing. \u201cThey didn\u2019t deserve to die. They wanted a better life.\u201d Contrary to earlier reports, Tima, who has been in Canada for 20 years, said she had not sponsored Abdullah and his family as refugee claimants but instead had tried to bring in another brother, Mohammed, and his children. She said he is currently in Germany after his bid was rejected. The Canadian government confirmed Mohammed Kurdi\u2019s family refugee application was turned down because it failed to meet requirements for refugee status recognition. It also confirmed it received no application for Abdullah Kurdi and his young family. At a campaign stop, Harper directly addressed the Kurdi family\u2019s tragedy, calling it a truly \u201cheartbreaking situation\u201d. The Conservative leader reiterated his promised that if re-elected, his government would do more to help those fleeing violence in Syria and highlighted Canada\u2019s involvement in the US-led military mission against Isis in Iraq and Syria, which neither of his political opponents, the New Democrats and the Liberals, support. Harper also underscored Canada\u2019s humanitarian response to the situation in Syria, which includes helping fund United Nations efforts to assist refugees. \u201cWe should be doing everything, we are doing everything and and we will do more of everything,\u201d he said. The immigration minister, Chris Alexander, announced on Thursday he was suspending his own re-election campaign and returning to Ottawa to look into the family\u2019s case. In a statement, he said the tragic photos of Aylan Kurdi \u201cbroke hearts around the world\u201d. \u201cLike all Canadians I was deeply saddened by that image and of many other images of the plight of the Syrian and Iraqi migrants fleeing persecution at the hands of Isis.\u201d He went on to note that Canada resettles more than one in 10 refugees worldwide. But opposition leaders say the Conservative government needs to do more to alleviate one of the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crises. At a campaign stop on Thursday, the Liberal leader, Justin Trudeau, had harsh words for Alexander. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to suddenly discover compassion in the middle of an election campaign,\u201d he said. Trudeau reiterated his call for Canada to grant asylum to 25,000 Syrian refugees in the coming months. Asked about the Kurdi family at a campaign event on Thursday morning in Toronto, the New Democrat leader, Tom Mulcair, said Canada had an \u201cobligation to act\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s just unbearable that we\u2019re doing nothing,\u201d Mulcair said. According to the department of citizenship and immigration, Canada has resettled a total 2,374 Syrian refugees, the majority of them through private sponsorship. Immigration lawyer Richard Kurland said that Canada seemed to be dragging its heels in bringing in Syrian refugees. Kurland conceded there would be many complicated refugee claims cases due to the chaotic situation in the region, but that given the scale of the crisis, it should be easy to quickly fill Canada\u2019s recent promise to bring in 10,000 Syrian refugees. That figure was in addition to a 2013 commitment to grant asylum to 1,300 Syrian refugees, a figure that was met in March, three months behind schedule. \u201cWhen you have a number and are not delivering in a timely manner, that\u2019s political poison. That\u2019s wrong, politically and morally,\u201d Kurland said. The Canadian Council for Refugees, a nonprofit group that lobbies for refugee rights, said Canada could make it easier for families like the Kurdis to be reunited by implementing flexible measures like temporary residency permits. Thursday was the second day that Alexander, the immigration minister, has made headlines over Canada\u2019s response to the refugee crisis. In a testy exchange on a political news show on Wednesday, Alexander accused the media of largely ignoring the longstanding crisis after facing questions over his government\u2019s reliance on its refugee sponsorship program, which allows designated organisations or citizens to directly sponsor individuals claiming asylum.

The national limit for each party this campaign is set at C$54.4m \u2013 more than double the C$21m limit of the last election in 2011.</p> <p>While this campaign will be the most expensive in Canadian history, the money is a drop in the bucket compared to what is spent on US elections.

Spending on the 2016 race is estimated to be more than double that.</p> <p>But this<strong> </strong>extended race will cost Canadian voters, since parties are reimbursed 50% of their campaign expenditures, with candidates getting 60% back on eligible expenses.

          "bodyText": "Canada\u2019s ruling Conservative party has been rocked by an unfolding corruption scandal that has threatened to derail its campaign before the 19 October general election. But despite the bribery and expenses affair that has the main opposition parties calling for the heads of senior staff in the prime minister\u2019s office, the Conservatives have maintained a campaign spending advantage that offers them a distinct electoral edge over their political rivals. The prime minister, Stephen Harper, has amassed a campaign war chest which outstrips those of both his main rivals combined \u2013 the leftwing New Democrats and the centrist Liberals \u2013 which, added to his decision to call an election early, guarantees that the Conservative party will reap the benefits of a funding advantage. The Conservatives called for the general election in early August, triggering an 11-week campaign \u2013 nearly double the 37-day minimum and the longest since the Victorian age. But thanks to a change in election rules passed by Harper\u2019s government in 2014, the 79-day campaign comes with an increased spending cap for registered parties. The national limit for each party this campaign is set at C$54.4m \u2013 more than double the C$21m limit of the last election in 2011. While this campaign will be the most expensive in Canadian history, the money is a drop in the bucket compared to what is spent on US elections. The 2012 presidential race cost over $2.6bn, according the Washington-based Center for Responsive Politics, with additional millions spent by candidates and outside groups like Super Pacs. Spending on the 2016 race is estimated to be more than double that. But this extended race will cost Canadian voters, since parties are reimbursed 50% of their campaign expenditures, with candidates getting 60% back on eligible expenses. In the last federal election, those reimbursements alone cost taxpayers C$60m, and they are expected to grow this year. This has all led to accusations by Harper\u2019s opponents that the Conservative leader has changed the election rules in his and his party\u2019s favour. Robert MacDermid, a political science professor at Toronto\u2019s York University, agreed, but noted: \u201cIt\u2019s not just the Conservatives. Every party that\u2019s been in power has tweaked the campaign finance rules to their own benefit.\u201d In 2004, Canada banned corporate and union donations to federal political parties, limiting donating power to individuals. Canadians can give an annual maximum of C$1,500 to each registered party and an additional C$1,500 in total to a party\u2019s local organisation (known as a riding association), nomination contestant or political candidate. The 2004 regulation change gave the then newly formed Conservative party a fundraising head start over the established Liberals, who had relied heavily on corporations to fill party coffers. The party already had a fundraising model adopted from their roots in the Reform party, a now-defunct rightwing populist party whose members were key in forming Canada\u2019s modern Conservatives. \u201cIt\u2019s a culture of a grassroots party that couldn\u2019t depend on corporate support,\u201d said Tom Flanagan, who served as the Conservative campaign manager in 2004 election and as a former chief of staff to Harper.

That system gave the party a significant fundraising edge, allowing it to regularly bring in more than double the funds of other parties over the years. Flanagan said the money has helped the Conservatives establish electoral dominance since they took power in 2006, giving them the ability both to develop and refine their fundraising machine and to hit rivals with television attack ads. \u201cThey used it to run pre-writ advertising targeted against the Liberal leader, and they really drove down the numbers of both [former Liberal leaders] St\u00e9phane Dion and Michael Ignatieff, who kind of limped into the [2008] election campaign. The Liberals didn\u2019t have the money to fight back,\u201d he said. It is a tactic they have also deployed against the current Liberal leader, Justin Trudeau, who has been labelled as \u201cjust not ready\u201d to be prime minister in a series of political attacks. The Liberals and the New Democrats have since narrowed the fundraising gap, but they have not surpassed the Conservatives\u2019 efforts. According to party financial returns, the Conservatives raised C$13.7m in the first six months of 2015, compared with the New Democrats\u2019 C$6.8m and the Liberals\u2019 C$8.2m. The party\u2019s fundraising prowess could help explain Harper\u2019s decision to trigger an election just days before his former chief of staff, Nigel Wright, was due to take the stand in an Ottawa courthouse to testify in Senator Mike Duffy\u2019s trial. Duffy, a once high-profile broadcaster whom Harper appointed to the Senate in 2009, has pleaded not guilty to 31 charges of fraud, breach of trust and bribery related to questionable expenses claims and a C$90,000 personal cheque from Wright to help him repay those expenses. Wright is not facing any criminal charges. The scandal and its ongoing fallout have dogged Harper on the campaign trail for days as reporters have continued to press the Conservative leader on how much he \u2013 and his current and former top aides \u2013 knew about the secretive deal to repay Duffy\u2019s expenses. MacDermid, the political science professor, suggests the desperate behind-the-scenes scramble by top aides to quash the Duffy scandal when it erupted in 2013 was linked in part to the prominent senator\u2019s fundraising role for the party. \u201cThis partly is the Duffy story \u2013 the party saw him as successful at fundraising events,\u201d he said. So far, polls suggest days of negative headlines and conflicting testimony from Harper\u2019s inner circle at the Duffy trial may turn soft-Conservative voters away from the party. Meanwhile, the New Democrats have maintained a slight lead in the polls with the Conservatives in a close second, putting both within reach of winning a minority government. The Liberals are currently in third place. But less than halfway through the campaign, Flanagan noted that Harper, who has never been broadly popular among Canadians, has nonetheless cobbled together a working coalition of voters for nearly 10 years. \u201cHow do they keep winning? This is part of the answer \u2013 better organization, better fundraising, better tactics,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t guarantee victory, but they\u2019ve had a run of three elections in a row.\u201d",

          "bodyText": "She is a prize-winning author who has conjured vivid dystopian futures, but on Friday Margaret Atwood found herself at the centre of a somewhat mundane censorship debate in the present. The acclaimed author penned a satirical column lambasting Canada\u2019s conservative prime minister Stephen Harper\u2019s hair, which has become an unusual talking point in the lead up to the general election in October. Hours after publication on the National Post website, the piece was removed. Senior newspaper staff later said \u201cthe necessary fact checking had not been completed\u201d. \u201cUm, did I just get censored? For my flighty little caper on Hair?\u201d Atwood tweeted after #Hairgate began trending on Twitter. Throughout the election campaign, the Canadian Conservative party has attacked Liberal leader Justin Trudeau as inexperienced and lacking in policy focus. It has also mocked him simply for having \u201cnice hair\u201d. Trudeau has hit back through advertising, arguing Harper is struggling to talk about anything else. Atwood\u2019s piece argued the entire debate had trivialised the election. \u201cHair, an election issue? Really?\u201d she wrote, before going on to poke fun at Harper. \u201cOf the three national male leaders, which one travels with a personal grooming assistant \u2013 lavishly paid for in whole or in part by you, gentle taxpayer \u2013 so that none of his hairs will ever be out of place \u2026 Hint: Initials are SH.\u201d The column was eventually republished by the National Post, with three sentences, which made reference to Harper\u2019s political donations and a recent travel expenses scandal, removed. The edits appeared to outrage the author even more \u2013 Atwood said the piece had been submitted nine days before it was published. \u201cWhich of my facts were Wrong? What are the alternate facts, presumably Right? Cite sources please,\u201d she tweeted at the National Post on Saturday, after thanking readers for the flurry of puns mocking the episode, which had erupted on Twitter throughout the day.",

          "body": "<p>Squinting slightly in the glare of the summer sun, Tom Mulcair stepped up to the podium in Montreal\u2019s sprawling Mount-Royal park and made his appeal to Canadian voters. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to when progressives from across the country can join those in Quebec to form the first New Democrat government in Canadian history,\u201d said the leader of a party which has long seemed the perpetual bridesmaid of Canadian politics.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/03/canada-election-parliament-stephen-harper\">Canada election 2015: a guide to the parties, polls and electoral system</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The progressive New Democratic Party has held seats in Canada\u2019s Parliament for decades but never taken power. Now, an election campaign which started a week ago presents supporters with the tantalizing possibility that \u2013 finally \u2013 the NDP has a legitimate shot at forming a national government, and of turning Canada away from the rightward course set by prime minister Stephen Harper.</p> <p>Mulcair and his team hope to build on the party\u2019s popularity in Quebec after their sweep of the Francophone province in the 2011 general election. Those results propelled the New Democratic Party (NDP) to official Opposition status in Canada\u2019s House of Commons from their traditional standing in third, fourth, sometimes fifth place.</p> <p>In the past few months, the party has surged in the polls and is now neck-and-neck with the ruling Conservatives. The Liberal Party \u2013 long considered Canada\u2019s natural governing party \u2013 is trailing in third.<br></p> <p>The NDP is now hoping they can capitalize on an appetite for change in an electorate growing weary of Harper. Outside their stable base of support, Conservative popularity has sagged amid an economic downturn and disaffection for a party that has been in power for nine years.</p> <p>Progressive Canadians are especially outraged at Harper\u2019s introduction of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/05/canada-anti-terror-law-despite-widespread-protest\">controversial anti-terrorism laws</a>; environmentalists have bridled at a climate change record that includes dropping out of the Kyoto Protocol, while others are frustrated by what they see as Canada\u2019s diminished standing on the world stage.</p> <p>An early sign that change might be on the way came in May, when the provincial NDP swept into power in Alberta \u2013 Harper\u2019s home province and an historic conservative bastion.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/06/canada-alberta-elects-leftwing-party-keystone-pipeline\">improbable win sent a shockwave through Canadian politics </a>and gave a shot in the arm to their federal counterparts. It was a signal to progressive voters that if they coalesced around the NDP, a national upset might also be in the cards. \u201cAlberta made everything seem possible,\u201d said NDP president Rebecca Blaikie.<br></p> <p>But the question remains whether Mulcair and his team of mostly young unknown candidates can expand their reach and unite the progressive vote behind the party.<br></p> <p>The NDP\u2019s provincial headquarters sit in Mulcair\u2019s own downtown Montreal electoral district \u2013 a vibrant slice of the city where wealthy Francophones, students, hipsters and immigrant populations mix.</p> <p>From an office building on St-Laurent Boulevard \u2013 a street that was once the symbolic dividing line between the city\u2019s French and English populations \u2013 the New Democrats have poured resources into maintaining their Quebec foothold as they seek to grow the party across the country.</p> <p>Nationally, the party has worked to allay concerns they lean too politically far left, softening their image by dropping references to socialism from the party constitution in 2013 and tempering their message on issues like free trade.<br></p> <p>But those changes may not have been enough to reassure Canadians. Even voters in Mulcair\u2019s own riding expressed doubts that the party was ready for office.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3f8d91c81a9e6a9768699bf44fcf679d17db7a20\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f8d91c81a9e6a9768699bf44fcf679d17db7a20/0_29_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Canada New Democratic Party\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A view of Parliament Hill in Ottawa.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Blair Gable/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Running errands on Parc Avenue, one of the city\u2019s main thoroughfares, Leo Bouchard, 62, said the NDP had done a good job representing the province, but predicted that the chilly economic climate will spook voters.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re talking about a recession,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople won\u2019t want to take a risk. They might not like Harper, but at least he offers stability.\u201d</p> <p>Bernard Desjarlais, 55, taking a mid-morning break up the street, called the NDP the \u201cleast objectionable choice\u201d out of the three main federal parties because they stand \u201cfor the common man, for the poor\u201d. But even he wondered whether they had the experience to govern. \u201cThey\u2019ll be a good team in four years,\u201d said Desjarlais.</p> <p>The lack of high-profile candidates is weak spot for the New Democrats, according to political scientist Antonia Maioni, with Montreal\u2019s McGill University. \u201cWe\u2019re talking a government-in-waiting, we\u2019re talking a potential cabinet,\u201d she said. \u201cWho can rise from that vanguard to really take a place beside Mr Mulcair on that podium?\u201d</p> <p>Harper \u2013 whose campaign slogan is \u201cProven Leadership\u201d \u2013 is trying to capitalize on those doubts. He recently took aim at the Quebec New Democrat caucus, accusing them of being ineffective and lacking in star power.<br></p> <p>In many ways, Quebec\u2019s 2011 \u201corange wave\u201d, named after the party\u2019s trademark colour, was a fluke \u2013 an unexpected wave of success that swept a host of NDP paper candidates to parliament, including university students and a bartender who vacationed in Las Vegas during the campaign.<br></p> <p>Early in the race, party strategists had predicted a modest breakthrough in the province, cautiously hoping for five or six seats. They walked away with 59 of the province\u2019s 75 MPs. <br></p> <p>The victory came down to an inspired race by Mulcair\u2019s charismatic predecessor, Jack Layton, whose walking cane became a symbol of courage when he led the campaign despite recent hip surgery.

          "bodyText": "Squinting slightly in the glare of the summer sun, Tom Mulcair stepped up to the podium in Montreal\u2019s sprawling Mount-Royal park and made his appeal to Canadian voters. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to when progressives from across the country can join those in Quebec to form the first New Democrat government in Canadian history,\u201d said the leader of a party which has long seemed the perpetual bridesmaid of Canadian politics. The progressive New Democratic Party has held seats in Canada\u2019s Parliament for decades but never taken power. Now, an election campaign which started a week ago presents supporters with the tantalizing possibility that \u2013 finally \u2013 the NDP has a legitimate shot at forming a national government, and of turning Canada away from the rightward course set by prime minister Stephen Harper. Mulcair and his team hope to build on the party\u2019s popularity in Quebec after their sweep of the Francophone province in the 2011 general election. Those results propelled the New Democratic Party (NDP) to official Opposition status in Canada\u2019s House of Commons from their traditional standing in third, fourth, sometimes fifth place. In the past few months, the party has surged in the polls and is now neck-and-neck with the ruling Conservatives. The Liberal Party \u2013 long considered Canada\u2019s natural governing party \u2013 is trailing in third. The NDP is now hoping they can capitalize on an appetite for change in an electorate growing weary of Harper. Outside their stable base of support, Conservative popularity has sagged amid an economic downturn and disaffection for a party that has been in power for nine years. Progressive Canadians are especially outraged at Harper\u2019s introduction of controversial anti-terrorism laws; environmentalists have bridled at a climate change record that includes dropping out of the Kyoto Protocol, while others are frustrated by what they see as Canada\u2019s diminished standing on the world stage. An early sign that change might be on the way came in May, when the provincial NDP swept into power in Alberta \u2013 Harper\u2019s home province and an historic conservative bastion. The improbable win sent a shockwave through Canadian politics and gave a shot in the arm to their federal counterparts. It was a signal to progressive voters that if they coalesced around the NDP, a national upset might also be in the cards. \u201cAlberta made everything seem possible,\u201d said NDP president Rebecca Blaikie. But the question remains whether Mulcair and his team of mostly young unknown candidates can expand their reach and unite the progressive vote behind the party. The NDP\u2019s provincial headquarters sit in Mulcair\u2019s own downtown Montreal electoral district \u2013 a vibrant slice of the city where wealthy Francophones, students, hipsters and immigrant populations mix. From an office building on St-Laurent Boulevard \u2013 a street that was once the symbolic dividing line between the city\u2019s French and English populations \u2013 the New Democrats have poured resources into maintaining their Quebec foothold as they seek to grow the party across the country. Nationally, the party has worked to allay concerns they lean too politically far left, softening their image by dropping references to socialism from the party constitution in 2013 and tempering their message on issues like free trade. But those changes may not have been enough to reassure Canadians. Even voters in Mulcair\u2019s own riding expressed doubts that the party was ready for office. Running errands on Parc Avenue, one of the city\u2019s main thoroughfares, Leo Bouchard, 62, said the NDP had done a good job representing the province, but predicted that the chilly economic climate will spook voters. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about a recession,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople won\u2019t want to take a risk. They might not like Harper, but at least he offers stability.\u201d Bernard Desjarlais, 55, taking a mid-morning break up the street, called the NDP the \u201cleast objectionable choice\u201d out of the three main federal parties because they stand \u201cfor the common man, for the poor\u201d. But even he wondered whether they had the experience to govern. \u201cThey\u2019ll be a good team in four years,\u201d said Desjarlais. The lack of high-profile candidates is weak spot for the New Democrats, according to political scientist Antonia Maioni, with Montreal\u2019s McGill University. \u201cWe\u2019re talking a government-in-waiting, we\u2019re talking a potential cabinet,\u201d she said. \u201cWho can rise from that vanguard to really take a place beside Mr Mulcair on that podium?\u201d Harper \u2013 whose campaign slogan is \u201cProven Leadership\u201d \u2013 is trying to capitalize on those doubts. He recently took aim at the Quebec New Democrat caucus, accusing them of being ineffective and lacking in star power. In many ways, Quebec\u2019s 2011 \u201corange wave\u201d, named after the party\u2019s trademark colour, was a fluke \u2013 an unexpected wave of success that swept a host of NDP paper candidates to parliament, including university students and a bartender who vacationed in Las Vegas during the campaign. Early in the race, party strategists had predicted a modest breakthrough in the province, cautiously hoping for five or six seats. They walked away with 59 of the province\u2019s 75 MPs. The victory came down to an inspired race by Mulcair\u2019s charismatic predecessor, Jack Layton, whose walking cane became a symbol of courage when he led the campaign despite recent hip surgery. But he was helped along by a dismal showing from the federal liberals \u2013 and the near complete collapse of the separatist Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois party. Quebecers, casting around for an alternative and tending to favour left-of-centre parties, fell for \u201cle bon Jack\u201d. When Layton died of cancer in August 2011, the party rallied around Mulcair, , and polls indicate the New Democrats remain popular in Quebec, where they are expected to retain most of their seats, and are doing well in British Columbia and Ontario. \u201cThe NDP now has the largest pool of potential supporters in the Canadian electorate than any of the other two parties,\u201d said pollster David Coletto. \u201cPeople view Tom Mulcair as a potential prime minister, they\u2019re open to voting for them.\u201d But Coletto also warned that Canada\u2019s stagnating economy could drive voters back to the Conservative fold in October. \u201cIt raises the stakes of electing the NDP,\u201d he said. Coletto suggested the party might take a page from the British Labour party under Tony Blair, who campaigned successfully under the \u201cNew Labour\u201d banner. \u201cIt was all about reassuring voters that new Labour wasn\u2019t old Labour \u2013 that they weren\u2019t going to raise your taxes, that they weren\u2019t going to nationalize every industry,\u201d he said. The British Labour party eventually tacked left again after Blair stood down, and is now going through a turbulent leadership contest which will help define its identify as leftwing or centrist. The NDP is attempting its own balancing act. Mulcair \u2013 seen as a pragmatic, centrist politician \u2013 hammered home that point in a televised leaders\u2019 debate on Thursday, where he repeatedly tried to cast his party as the moderate choice between political extremes. Matt Browne, who worked on New Labour campaigns in 2001 and 2005, argued modern progressive parties cannot win votes by shifting towards the centre, but instead need to offer a true alternative and aspirational economic message. Browne contends it was a vision former British Labour party leader Ed Miliband failed to present in the UK election earlier this year. \u201cThe battleground of this [Canadian] election \u2013 in terms of the future progressive politics \u2013 is who owns the economy of the future,\u201d said Browne, who is now a fellow at the Center for American Progress, a Washington-based thinktank. \u201cIt can\u2019t be just a debate about inequality and the squeezed middle, it has to be about a modern vision for what a more diversified, broader Canadian economy looks like,\u201d he said. With global oil prices at multi-month lows and the oil pipeline projects championed by Harper held up by regulatory hurdles in Canada and the US, the Conservatives have come under severe criticism for failing to diversify the Canadian economy beyond its natural resources sector. At this week\u2019s debate Harper acknowledged what economic indicators have been suggesting for months: Canada is heading into recession, and low oil prices are probably to blame. The New Democrats have rolled out some populist policy planks, promising to establish a national affordable daycare plan, a $15 federal minimum wage, and to close tax loopholes that primarily benefit the wealthiest Canadians. They have also committed to hiking corporate tax rates to bring them closer to the G7 average while offering tax relief for small business and Canadian manufacturing. But the road to election day on 19 October is long. While it pales in comparison to the United States\u2019 political marathon where Democrat and Republican candidates are already fighting for election in 2016, Canada\u2019s 78-day campaign will be the longest in modern Canadian history. The Conservatives, running unopposed on the right, have so far largely ignored the NDP chief, concentrating their fire on Liberal leader Justin Trudeau, 43, who they characterize as inexperienced and \u201cnot ready\u201d for high office. Those attacks have eaten into Trudeau\u2019s poll numbers, but the Liberal leader remains a threat as Mulcair\u2019s main progressive rival. That raises the prospect that the progressive vote could split between the Liberals and the NDP, letting Harper remain in power. Both Mulcair and Trudeau have been asked about the possibility of forming a coalition after the election but while the NDP leader has expressed openness to the idea, the liberals have balked at the possibility. Pollsters are hesitant to make any bold predictions at this stage in the campaign, but NDP president Blaikie maintains progressive Canadians have been waiting for just this opportunity to rally behind her team. \u201cThere have always been in Canada a large number of people who wanted to vote NDP, who thought about voting NDP and weren\u2019t sure that a NDP government was possible,\u201d she said. \u201cThis time, an NDP government is possible.\u201d",

Trudeau, the son of former popular prime minister Pierre, has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/31/canada-liberal-party-justin-trudeau-interview-election\">seen his party</a> squeezed into the shrinking middle ground by the Conservatives on the right and the NDP on the left.</p> <p>Harper, too, is having a difficult time. He lost his party\u2019s natural base, the resource-rich province of Alberta, to the left-of-center NDP in a huge upset in the provincial elections earlier this year. However Alberta and Ontario remain crucial battlegrounds, while the NDP will look to consolidate their predicted gains in British Columbia and Qu\u00e9bec.</p> <p>The NDP have never formed a government, and only found their way into opposition for the first time in the last election after the collapse of the nationalist Bloc Quebecois. Harper will be looking to paint them as untested and inexperienced. And while the NDP may currently be enjoying an upswing in the polls, they still lag behind the business-friendly Conservatives in fundraising. </p> <p>The prime minister\u2019s job will go to whichever party wins enough districts, known as ridings. There are 338 up for grabs. With most of an 11-week campaign still to go before election night on October 19 \u2013 the longest campaign in Canadian history, though this is nothing compared to the marathon two-year election campaigns seen south of the border \u2013 there is still everything to play for. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-08-06T23:53:40.523Z\">at 12.53am BST</time></p>  </div>",

          "bodyText": "The immediate winner tonight is Elizabeth May. But the strategic victor is Tom Mulcair\u2019s NDP. Under attack from the other three parties, Harper withered. But while May rose to fill the room, and Mulcair\u2019s calm demeanor gave him the last word over and over again, Trudeau failed to hit the near-impossible moving target he had to hit to put his party back in contention. Trudeau\u2019s speech is themed around being \u201cready.\u201d \u201cMr. Harper wants you to believe that better just isn\u2019t possible. But I think thats wong. We are who we are and Canada is what Canada is, because we\u2019ve always known that better is possible.\u201d I don\u2019t know what that means. May thanks organisers for the opportunity to speak to the nation. She may not face the other candidates in any other debate, she says - which is true. Though after her performance this evening she well experience a bit of a bump in the polls. Mulcair next. Thanks organisers and viewers. \u201cIn this election there is a clear choice,\u201d he says. \u201cMr. Harper has the worst jobs record since the second world war. Run up eight deficits in a row and added 50bn to Canada\u2019s debt. Sorry. Mr Harper\u2019s plan clearly isn\u2019t working.\u201d \u201cClearly isn\u2019t working\u201d was another bingo card phrase. If you had that, you are also a winner. \u201cProven experience,\u201d is Harper\u2019s opening gambit. Points to market turmoil in China, debt crisis in Europe. Trying to say he\u2019s a safe pair of hands. But he looks, and sounds, rattled. Closing remarks now. Or this one: May\u2019s line of the night - probably the line of the night overall - is on C51. \u201cIt\u2019s a disaster.\u201d \u201cThis is an issue that people are quite rightly worked up about,\u201d says Trudeau, pretty lamely Harper is rattled. \u201cIf you are not prepared to call the threat the ... thing that it is, you are not prepared to defend this country.\u201d Then May hits him again. She\u2019s relentless, with a machine-gun delivery. In almost so many words, Mulcair calls Harper - essentially - an Islamophobe, for targeting mosques. And, having done the hard work, May leaves the cleanup to Mulcair. The NDP \u201cWill repeal C51,\u201d he says, looking straight into the camera. The first real attack on C51 comes from May. There is no oversight. There is no oversight at all. This act ... Makes. Us. Less. Safe.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll let Mr. Trudeau explain his own position; he\u2019s been for and against the legislation at the same time,\u201d says Harper dismissively. Final round of questioning for Trudeau finally gets to C51, the deeply unpopular counter-terror bill that his party supported. This was always going to be a tough moment for Trudeau. He\u2019s fudging - he\u2019s clearly fudging - talking about amendments; being constructive. \u201cPerhaps it was naive,\u201d he says. It\u2019s about as well as he can do under the circumstances. But it\u2019s still not a winning moment for the Liberal leader. Scorecard so far, as we head into the final round of questions: Harper 2/10 Mulcair 7/10 May 8/10 Trudeau 4/10 Suddenly, for the first time, May of the Green party sounds like she might be on the same hawkish side as Harper. \u201cAssad is a butcher,\u201d she says. However, she says, ISIS is trying \u201cto draw us into the region.\u201d \u201cWe are actually doing what they want when we go in with bombing missions.\u201d Harper accuses Trudeau of trying to \u201cslag the military.\u201d More from Maxwell Cameron of UBC\u2019s political science department. The attack by Trudeau on Mulcair regarding the clarity act is all about trying to drive a wedge between the NDP and the Quebec federalists voter. It is an important part of this debate. \u201cUnfortunately, Mr. Harper hasn\u2019t seen a war he hasn\u2019t wanted to get involved in,\u201d says Trudeau. \u201cWell, I... I don\u2019t think this government has got involved in many military engagements,\u201d Harper almost-stammers. Pivots quickly to the threat of ISIS. \u201cIt would be foolish not to go after this group before they go after us.\u201d Straight out of the David Cameron playbook. Very much UK-led in influence, this debate. Little drawn from Canada\u2019s immediate neighbour to the south so far in terms of tics or tactics. First question to Tom Mulcair. \u201cWould the NDP ever send troops into combat?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve shown that willingness in the case of Libya. Then we withdrew that when they changed the mission.\u201d \u201cBut before I would ever sent in their brave men and women, I would ... make sure we had a clearly defined mission, and a clear exit strategy.\u201d On ISIS, he says that the situation is \u201cthe result of the last misguided war\u201d in Iraq. In response, May immediately gets in a \u201cwith all due respect.\u201d And we\u2019re done with the government segment. Up next, the last segment: foreign policy and security \u201cIt\u2019s not my top priority, because it\u2019s hard,\u201d says May on Senate reform. \u201cOne billion dollars has been spent on the Senate on Mr. Harper\u2019s watch,\u201d Mulcair says. He\u2019s on a roll. \u201cOne billion dollars.\u201d Mulcair now promising to get rid of the unelected upper house entirely. \u201cIt\u2019s a relic ... of our past\u201d Harper is drowning on the issue of his senators. Quibbling about the number of Liberal senators there are with Trudeau, but he\u2019s badly lost this segment on procedure. \u201cI don\u2019t want my grandchildren to have to bear the burden for wrong-headed choices made today,\u201d says Mulcair. He and May double-teaming Harper for his appointed Senate killing an environmental bill passed by the elected congress. \u201cWith all due respect\u201d klaxon sounded for the first time for Elizabeth May Fast-moving debate on Quebec and Clarity Act summed-up by contributor John Barber: Back in Canada, things are getting pretty heated too. \u201cIsn\u2019t it ironic that this segment was supposed to be about how much heckling there is, how difficult it is to have conversation in parliament?\u201d says May after a rather heated back-and-forth on Quebec independence. \u201cAs Canadians, surely we can disagree without being disagreeable.\u201d Meanwhile, in America: Question is, is this the round in which Harper will take flak for the unpopular counter-terrorism bill C51? Mulcair has pledged to repeal it; but Trudeau\u2019s Liberal party helped pass the bill, which is part of the reason they have slipped in the polls. \u201cDo you worry that Green candidates will take support away from candidates who might help defeat this government?\u201d the moderator asks Elizabeth May. \u201cWe need ... to understand this election isn\u2019t about electing a prime minister,\u201d she says. It\u2019s about electing local representatives, she says. Up next: the state of Canada\u2019s democracy. End of the environment section. Meanwhile, debate fans, I\u2019m hearing rumours of another clash taking place just south of the border in the great state of Ohio. Someone called \u201cDonald Trump\u201d will apparently take the stage. I\u2019ve never heard of him, but my colleague Alan Yuhas is live-tweeting that debate here. Maxwell Cameron, a professor of political science, is watching the debate in Vancouver. So far, all three opponents have hammered Harper on his record. Elizabeth May has been especially effective, but I think Mulcair\u2019s line about \u2018which recession?\u2019 was good. Also Trudeau is looking strong, confident, and holding his own among more experienced leaders. \u201c[Harper\u2019s] taking real heat on environment. Nobody in the room here is buying what he\u2019s selling in terms of Canada\u2019s record on emissions.\u201d Trudeau needed to do much, much better than this tonight. Meanwhile: \u201cKeystone XL represents the export of 40,000 jobs\u201d says Mulcair. Says he wants to keep those jobs at home. \u201cShould Canadians assume major energy projects will be on hold for a Mulcair prime ministership?\u201d asks the moderator. \u201cPart of sustainable development is creating those value-added jobs and keeping them in your own country,\u201d he says, without directly answering the question. Then he goes on the attack: \u201cHere\u2019s the rub: Mr Harper has got the balance all wrong.\u201d He points to the Conservatives\u2019 scrapping of environmental protection legislation; says that Harper\u2019s \u201cbelligerent butting-head approach\u201d isn\u2019t working with Canada\u2019s indigenous First Nation peoples re: resource-control. Point: Mulcair If you had \u201cpipelines going hither and yon\u201d on your Canada debate bingo card, come up and collect your prize. Harper looking more and more under siege. In a direct sense, Green party leader Elizabeth May is winning tonight. In a strategic sense, Mulcair\u2019s NDP will do best from everyone ganging up on the tories. Meanwhile, Elizabeth May is getting huge plaudits from the Twittocracy. Is she Canada\u2019s Nicola Sturgeon? We\u2019re back, and a tough question for Harper. What has he actually achieved on energy exports? Harper brings up Keystone. \u201cI\u2019ve had many conversations with President Obama,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m very optimistic about the future of that project.\u201d Do you think we have to wait for a new President for that? \u201cThat may be the case,\u201d says Harper. \u201cBut I think whoever is the next President will approve that project.\u201d The economic section is over, much to what must be Harper\u2019s relief. Though his relief may be short-lived: energy and the environment is up next. \u201cFor five months in a row the Canadian government has shrunk,\u201d Mulcair says in answer. He has an unerring ability to get the last word. Here\u2019s the problem for Trudeau. He already has an image problem as young and inexperienced. He looks very presentable; but he umms and ahhs a lot; he seems nervous. He knows he has the most to prove. But Mulcair seems, or is, much calmer; he waits for Trudeau and Harper to finish, doesn\u2019t speak over anyone, but comes off as confident and assured. If you have \u201cmiddle-class\u201d on your Canadian leaders\u2019 debate bingo card tonight, you are already a winner. Trudeau tries to outflank Mulcair on the left, proposing income taxes on the richest 1%. \u201cWe think that Canadians are paying their fare share,\u201d Mulcair answers. \u201cWe think corporations are not.\u201d May has the floor now, and is attacking Harper again on his fiscal responsibility: It\u2019s not just Mulcair who\u2019s Milibanding straight into the camera. Trudeau and Harper both doing it too. Mulcair: \u201cMr. Harper, we really can\u2019t afford four more years of you.\u201d The live-stream of tonight\u2019s debate, by the way, is here. The UK comparison is an illuminating one. Like in the British leaders\u2019 debates, Elizabeth May, the green party leader, is focussing her attacks on the incumbent Harper. Trudeau, so far, is using that alliance to keep the pressure on Harper. But it\u2019s possible that Mulcair is the one who will really benefit. Tom Mulcair now speaks for the first time. \u201cWe want to invest,\u201d he says, in infrastructure, families, and the middle class. Brit political aficionados: he appears to have picked up that Ed Miliband habit of staring straight down the camera. Which didn\u2019t do Ed much good. Harper responds now, already on the back foot as he defends his record. \u201cNon-energy experts are up,\u201d he says, but promises \u201cgrowth going forward.\u201d \u201cPrudent\u201d is how he describes his economic stewardship. We can expect him to try to use the other candidates\u2019 inexperience against them. But it bears remembering that the economy has not grown as fast as he would have liked, especially since the oil price has dropped. Justin Trudeau gets the first question, and is immediately on the attack against Harper. \u201cSimply not working,\u201d he says of the sitting prime minister\u2019s economic plan. The economy up first. Here\u2019s what\u2019s at stake tonight. Polls are near-as-dammit showing a dead heat between Tom Mulcair\u2019s NDP and the incumbent tories led by Stephen Harper. The big question tonight is whether anyone can move the needle in their direction. And we\u2019re off. The economy, energy and environment, the state of Canada\u2019s democracy, and foreign policy and security will be the four topic areas. John Barber, another contributor, will be watching in Toronto and contributing his views. Last week he wrote this briefing on Liberal leader Justin Trudeau\u2019s bleak outlook. His take going into this debate is this: All parties and media are advising watchers to lower expectations, given the season (high summer, low viewership), the timing (so early in such a long campaign) and the competition (Trump!). But low expectations that relieve pressure could also encourage the candidates to take some chances. So I expect a surprise or two. Trudeau\u2019s decision to precede the debate by releasing an action video showing him throwing furious jabs in a boxing ring is pure Trumpism. Harper\u2019s invention of a phantom \u201cNetflix tax\u201d with which to cudgel opponents is more Barnum-esque. If we don\u2019t hear words that will ring repeatedly throughout the campaign, we could see some interesting new tactics. Trudeau\u2019s job is to show he has \u201cbottom.\u201d Harper\u2019s job is to show he\u2019s human. Mulcair\u2019s job is to show he is comfortingly stolid. None of those tasks quite requires the knives to come out \u2026 yet. T-7 minutes to debate time. Our contributor Jessica Murphy is in Ottawa watching the debate, and has this to say: Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Green Party leader Elizabeth May will be the only two who have participated in federal election debates before, though Harper is by far the most experienced, having participated in them in campaigns since 2004. That said, the NDP\u2019s Tom Mulcair goes in with high expectations. He\u2019s a lawyer and has used those skills to great effect in the House of Commons during question period against Harper, often acting something of a prosecutor. Liberal leader Justin Trudeau has the most to prove - hence the Tory spokesman\u2019s comment that if he shows up with his pants on he comes in ahead. Welcome to our live coverage of the first Canadian party leaders\u2019 debate, moderated by Macleans\u2019 magazine political editor Paul Wells. Incumbent Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper faces off tonight against National Democratic Party (NDP) leader Tom Mulcair, Liberal party leader Justin Trudeau and Green party leader Elizabeth May. Harper has been PM since 2006, but polling currently puts Mulcair\u2019s party in the lead over the Conservatives by the barest of margins, with Trudeau\u2019s centrist Liberals relegated to third place. Trudeau, the son of former popular prime minister Pierre, has seen his party squeezed into the shrinking middle ground by the Conservatives on the right and the NDP on the left. Harper, too, is having a difficult time. He lost his party\u2019s natural base, the resource-rich province of Alberta, to the left-of-center NDP in a huge upset in the provincial elections earlier this year. However Alberta and Ontario remain crucial battlegrounds, while the NDP will look to consolidate their predicted gains in British Columbia and Qu\u00e9bec. The NDP have never formed a government, and only found their way into opposition for the first time in the last election after the collapse of the nationalist Bloc Quebecois. Harper will be looking to paint them as untested and inexperienced. And while the NDP may currently be enjoying an upswing in the polls, they still lag behind the business-friendly Conservatives in fundraising. The prime minister\u2019s job will go to whichever party wins enough districts, known as ridings. There are 338 up for grabs. With most of an 11-week campaign still to go before election night on October 19 \u2013 the longest campaign in Canadian history, though this is nothing compared to the marathon two-year election campaigns seen south of the border \u2013 there is still everything to play for.",

          "bodyText": "Canada heads to the polls on Monday 19 October to elect members to the 42nd Canadian parliament. At 78 days, it will be the longest campaign since 1872. Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper will attempt to become the first prime minister since 1908 to win four consecutive elections. The voting system The next Canadian parliament will be composed of 338 seats (expanded from the current 308) following the results of the latest census. The number of districts is reviewed every 10 years. Members of parliament are elected through a first-past-the-post system \u2013 the candidate that comes first in each electoral district, called a riding, wins that seat. The 338 ridings are distributed among Canada\u2019s 10 provinces and three territories according to the country\u2019s population. Canada has elected 11 minority governments in its history, and there have also been two minority administrations after governments were replaced during elections. Turnout has dropped to below 70% in more recent votes. Canada\u2019s parliament has an upper and a lower house. Although legislation needs to pass through both houses, and can originate in both houses, the House of Commons is by far the dominant chamber. The Senate rarely rejects bills, and the government only needs to retain the confidence of the lower house. The Senate consists of 105 members appointed by the governor general on the advice of the prime minister. Senate seats are assigned on a regional basis. The political parties Conservative Party of Canada: Centre-right party led by Prime Minister Stephen Harper has led the Canadian government since 2006. Liberal Party of Canada: Centre-left party led by Justin Trudeau, son of former prime minister Pierre. The Liberals became known as Canada\u2019s \u201cnatural governing party\u201d, holding power for nearly 70 years in the 20th century, more than any other party in a developed and democratic country. However, support for the party has declined over the past decade. Its result in the previous election in 2011 was its worst ever \u2013 and the first time the Liberals came in third. The Conservatives (under the party\u2019s different historic guises and names) and the Liberals have dominated Canadian politics and are the only two parties to have formed a government. New Democratic Party (NDP): A social-democratic party to the left of the Liberals. Its leader is Thomas Mulcair. The party was founded in 1961, and in the 2011 election it became the official opposition for the first time in its history. Earlier this year the NDP won a surprise majority in Alberta and the party has surged in federal polls since. Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois: A party focused on promoting Quebec\u2019s interests and sovereignty in the Commons. In the Quebec election of 2014, its provincial equivalent, the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, suffered its worst ever defeat after the party, which was in government at the time, called a snap election on the back of strong polls that projected a possible majority. Instead, the Liberals won a majority and Premier Pauline Marois lost her own riding. The Green Party: Led by Elizabeth May, who in 2011 became the first elected Green MP in the party\u2019s history. Strength in Democracy: A new party founded in 2014. It currently has two MPs following defections from the Bloc and from an NDP member (also from Quebec). The 2011 result In May 2011, the Conservatives won an outright majority following two minority administrations (in 2006 and 2008). According to Inter-Parliamentary Union data, only 25% of Canada\u2019s MPs are women \u2013 which is higher than the proportion in the US (20%). Turnout was 61.1%. The full 2011 results can be found here. What do the the polls say?* Support for the Conservatives has flatlined in the final weeks of the campaign, while the NDP has dropped substantially and Mulcair\u2019s party has gone from frontrunner to lagging in third place. Meanwhile, the Liberals have taken a small lead on the back of Trudeau\u2019s strong debate performances. However, because of Canada\u2019s voting system, it\u2019s all about the contest in each individual riding. And with the risk of the vote on the left splitting, this could favour the Tories. A minority Liberal government appears to be the most likely outcome - if the polls are right. A note of caution \u2013 the polling looks quite similar to May\u2019s UK election, which saw surveys expecting a neck-and-neck race between the Conservatives and the Labour party. In the event, the Tories won a small majority. The UK, in fact, has a similar voting system to Canada\u2019s. On election day, polls are open for 12 hours across the country. The voting hours are staggered across the country\u2019s different time zones so that the majority of results are available at approximately the same time on election night. Polls in the eastern provinces close at 9.30pm. *Polls will be updated throughout the campaign.

I think the position that the federal government has taken has not been helpful,\u201d Wynne said.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not news to anyone, because the fact that I have been calling for a partner, and the fact that we have been saying we need the federal government to be working with us and to be doing more, that\u2019s public knowledge,\u201d she went on. \u201cThat call is born out of my disappointment at what the federal government has been doing.\u201d</p> <p>She noted that Harper had failed to either attend the regional climate meeting or to send Leona Aglukkaq, the environment minister.

Last week\u2019s meeting of 22 states, provinces and territories called for setting a price on carbon.</p> <p>Ontario won positive attention when it phased out the use of coal in its power plants last year. </p> <p>But the environmental commissioner said on 7 July that the <a href=\"http://www.thestar.com/news/queenspark/2015/07/07/ontario-warned-to-do-more-on-greenhouse-gas-targets.html\">province would have to do much more</a> to meet its 2020 target for cutting greenhouse gas emissions. <br></p> <p>Wynne\u2019s advisers said she hoped to cut carbon pollution from transport by investing in public transit and easing congestion.</p> <p>Climate change looms even larger over Harper, who faces increasing criticism at home and abroad tying Canada\u2019s economic future to the development of the tar sands.</p> <p>At international climate conferences, the Harper government now is routinely handed out mock \u201cfossil\u201d awards for its failure to deal with climate change. Campaigners have accused Harper of treading on the rights of government scientists. </p> <p>The expansion of Alberta\u2019s tar sands production on Harper\u2019s watch has turned Canada into the <a href=\"http://www.wri.org/blog/2014/11/6-graphs-explain-world%E2%80%99s-top-10-emitters\">world\u2019s biggest carbon polluter on a per capita basis</a>, according to the World Resources Institute, a respected environmental thinktank. <br></p> <p>Wynne said Canada should have put forward a more ambitious <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/15/canada-reneges-emissions-targets-tar-sands-production\">climate pledge </a>ahead of the UN negotiations in Paris.</p> <p>Canada will not meet its 2020 target for cutting emissions because of the tar sands, and it has retreated still further from those earlier promises in its pledge ahead of the Paris climate talks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b50d1f8a16471f0faa2888d243cefd3a9dcd729\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b50d1f8a16471f0faa2888d243cefd3a9dcd729/0_145_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fellow signatories applaud as Wynne signs a declaration alongside Vermont governor Peter Shumlin, right, and Quebec\u2019s premier, Philippe Couillard, center left, at the Climate Summit of the Americas meeting in Toronto on 9 July.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fellow signatories applaud as Kathleen Wynne signs a declaration alongside Vermont\u2019s Governor Peter Shumlin, right, and Quebec\u2019s premier, Philippe Couillard, center left, at the Climate Summit of the Americas meeting in Toronto on 9 July.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Young/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Economists and energy experts have said that Canada cannot hope to meet its climate commitments without tackling the tar sands.<br></p> <p>But Wynne \u2013 although she acknowledged findings by scientists that the majority of those deposits needs to stay in the ground to avoid catastrophic climate change \u2013 rejected the idea of a ban on new production.<br></p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we can pretend that making some kind of unilateral federal government decision around Alberta\u2019s economy at this point would be a) that it\u2019s possible or b) that it would be helpful,\u201d she said.<br></p> <p>Campaigners needed to recognise that \u201cfossil fuels will be with us for some time\u201d, she said.<br></p>",

          "bodyText": "The leader of Canada\u2019s biggest province has escalated her feud with the country\u2019s prime minister, accusing Stephen Harper of obstructing efforts to fight climate change and calling on Canadians to make global warming a decisive issue in the coming elections. In an interview with the Guardian, Kathleen Wynne, the Liberal premier of Ontario, brought long-simmering tensions with Harper over energy and economic policy to a rollicking boil, repeatedly calling out the Conservative prime minister for blocking efforts to cut carbon pollution. When it came to fighting climate change, Harper was an obstruction rather than a help, she said. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a collaborative process around any of this, and that is a real problem because it means that we are not supporting each other and we are not pushing each other in a constructive way. It is very confrontational,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are taking action in spite of [the federal government], quite frankly,\u201d Wynne said. \u201cThe federal government at this point is just not helpful.\u201d Despite her strong language, Wynne opposes a ban on new projects and pipelines in the Alberta tar sands \u2013 the fastest-growing source of Canada\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions, and the reason Canada is the only industrialised country to fall short of its emissions targets. The Ontario premier reached an agreement with other provincial leaders on Friday that campaigners said would expand tar sands pipelines without sufficient protections for the environment. The new national energy strategy does not include targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In his nine years as prime minister, Harper has vigorously promoted the tar sands, presiding over an expansion of production and lobbying for more exports and pipelines to build up Canada into his vision of an energy superpower. But Harper\u2019s vision for Canada ran into growing international criticism of the country\u2019s rising greenhouse gas emissions, and exposed the economy to the volatility of global oil prices. In the run-up to the 19 October election, opinion polls show Harper trailing or tied with the leftwing New Democratic party, and Wynne\u2019s Liberal party \u2013 which is led at federal level by Justin Trudeau \u2013 coming in third in a tight race. Speaking on the sidelines of the Climate Summit of the Americas in Toronto last week, Wynne added to growing criticism of Harper\u2019s economic and environmental policies, saying that the prime minister was not a partner in the fight against climate change. \u201cI think there is a lot more that he can do. I think the position that the federal government has taken has not been helpful,\u201d Wynne said. \u201cThat\u2019s not news to anyone, because the fact that I have been calling for a partner, and the fact that we have been saying we need the federal government to be working with us and to be doing more, that\u2019s public knowledge,\u201d she went on. \u201cThat call is born out of my disappointment at what the federal government has been doing.\u201d She noted that Harper had failed to either attend the regional climate meeting or to send Leona Aglukkaq, the environment minister. Harper also stayed away from the premiers\u2019 meeting on Friday. Wynne called on Canadians to vote on climate change in the October elections. \u201cI hope that climate change and taking action on climate change is an election issue,\u201d she said. As premier, Wynne has championed the efforts of Ontario and other provinces to deal with climate change. Last week\u2019s meeting of 22 states, provinces and territories called for setting a price on carbon. Ontario won positive attention when it phased out the use of coal in its power plants last year. But the environmental commissioner said on 7 July that the province would have to do much more to meet its 2020 target for cutting greenhouse gas emissions. Wynne\u2019s advisers said she hoped to cut carbon pollution from transport by investing in public transit and easing congestion. Climate change looms even larger over Harper, who faces increasing criticism at home and abroad tying Canada\u2019s economic future to the development of the tar sands. At international climate conferences, the Harper government now is routinely handed out mock \u201cfossil\u201d awards for its failure to deal with climate change. Campaigners have accused Harper of treading on the rights of government scientists. The expansion of Alberta\u2019s tar sands production on Harper\u2019s watch has turned Canada into the world\u2019s biggest carbon polluter on a per capita basis, according to the World Resources Institute, a respected environmental thinktank. Wynne said Canada should have put forward a more ambitious climate pledge ahead of the UN negotiations in Paris. Canada will not meet its 2020 target for cutting emissions because of the tar sands, and it has retreated still further from those earlier promises in its pledge ahead of the Paris climate talks. Economists and energy experts have said that Canada cannot hope to meet its climate commitments without tackling the tar sands. But Wynne \u2013 although she acknowledged findings by scientists that the majority of those deposits needs to stay in the ground to avoid catastrophic climate change \u2013 rejected the idea of a ban on new production. \u201cI don\u2019t think we can pretend that making some kind of unilateral federal government decision around Alberta\u2019s economy at this point would be a) that it\u2019s possible or b) that it would be helpful,\u201d she said. Campaigners needed to recognise that \u201cfossil fuels will be with us for some time\u201d, she said.",

          "body": "<p>Canada\u2019s increasingly unpopular Conservative government stumbled through a bruising spring in which it enraged the nation and alienated some of its most faithful supporters. But the prime minister, Stephen Harper, is entering the race for re-election this autumn with the wind at its back.</p> <p>The reason parallels the situation in the UK, where David Cameron returned with a majority of seats conjured from a bare plurality of votes. Opposition to Harper is evenly divided between two major opposition parties \u2013 the Liberals and the New Democrats \u2013 so the one-third of voters who vote Conservative are set once again to choose Canada\u2019s national government.</p> <p>\u201cMost analysts here think that vote-splitting will help Harper and the Conservatives,\u201d says Ted Morton, a former Conservative politician and senior fellow at the Manning Foundation thinktank in Calgary. As evidence, he points to the last election, in which Harper prefigured Cameron\u2019s feat by winning a solid majority of seats with fewer than 40% of votes.</p> <p>\u201cHarper is still within reach of a minority, if not yet a majority,\u201d Morton says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/06/canada-alberta-elects-leftwing-party-keystone-pipeline\">Canada's political landscape undergoes seismic shift with election in Alberta</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Conservatives gained fresh hope of a sort this week with the release of polls showing a strong surge in support for the leftwing New Democratic party following its surprise victory in a recent provincial election in Alberta, a staunchly conservative region often called the Texas of Canada.</p> <p> The NDP gains have drawn the federal party tied with the Conservatives and the Liberal party in voter approval ratings as the long campaign begins, thus improving the odds that the increasingly restive majority of Canadians who oppose the Harper government will once again divide their votes and usher him to victory.</p> <p>Outsiders will find little to distinguish between the two parties now promising a progressive alternative to the Conservatives. </p> <p>Under their dashing but unproven young leader, Justin Trudeau, the Liberals have attempted a youth-centred revival promising a break from the complacency and cronyism of the party\u2019s recent past. </p> <p>The New Democrats \u2013 led by bearded, experienced Thomas Mulcair \u2013 have emulated Tony Blair\u2019s New Labour by jettisoning their old-school socialist baggage and veering onto the centre-left terrain previously monopolized by the Liberals.</p> <p>The one wedge that opens clear light between the two opposition leaders is their stated willingness to cooperate in an effort to defeat Harper.

          "bodyText": "Canada\u2019s increasingly unpopular Conservative government stumbled through a bruising spring in which it enraged the nation and alienated some of its most faithful supporters. But the prime minister, Stephen Harper, is entering the race for re-election this autumn with the wind at its back. The reason parallels the situation in the UK, where David Cameron returned with a majority of seats conjured from a bare plurality of votes. Opposition to Harper is evenly divided between two major opposition parties \u2013 the Liberals and the New Democrats \u2013 so the one-third of voters who vote Conservative are set once again to choose Canada\u2019s national government. \u201cMost analysts here think that vote-splitting will help Harper and the Conservatives,\u201d says Ted Morton, a former Conservative politician and senior fellow at the Manning Foundation thinktank in Calgary. As evidence, he points to the last election, in which Harper prefigured Cameron\u2019s feat by winning a solid majority of seats with fewer than 40% of votes. \u201cHarper is still within reach of a minority, if not yet a majority,\u201d Morton says. The Conservatives gained fresh hope of a sort this week with the release of polls showing a strong surge in support for the leftwing New Democratic party following its surprise victory in a recent provincial election in Alberta, a staunchly conservative region often called the Texas of Canada. The NDP gains have drawn the federal party tied with the Conservatives and the Liberal party in voter approval ratings as the long campaign begins, thus improving the odds that the increasingly restive majority of Canadians who oppose the Harper government will once again divide their votes and usher him to victory. Outsiders will find little to distinguish between the two parties now promising a progressive alternative to the Conservatives. Under their dashing but unproven young leader, Justin Trudeau, the Liberals have attempted a youth-centred revival promising a break from the complacency and cronyism of the party\u2019s recent past. The New Democrats \u2013 led by bearded, experienced Thomas Mulcair \u2013 have emulated Tony Blair\u2019s New Labour by jettisoning their old-school socialist baggage and veering onto the centre-left terrain previously monopolized by the Liberals. The one wedge that opens clear light between the two opposition leaders is their stated willingness to cooperate in an effort to defeat Harper. After some prevarication this spring, Trudeau ultimately rejected calls to form a coalition with the NDP in order to topple the Tories, citing personal differences with Mulcair. \u201cHis style is anchored in the old way of practising politics,\u201d Trudeau said. By contrast, Mulcair has openly embraced cooperation in an effort to distinguish himself from the Liberal leader, eldest son of the late prime minister Pierre Trudeau. \u201cMy first priority is to get rid of Stephen Harper,\u201d he said in response to the Liberal leader\u2019s rebuff. \u201cThe first priority of Justin Trudeau is Justin Trudeau.\u201d As deadlock looms and commentators descend into familiar demands for electoral reform, the leftwing campaign group Council of Canadians has launched a voter registration campaign, confident that increasing the last campaign\u2019s historically low 61% turnout will accomplish the necessary work automatically. \u201cIt\u2019s a complicated situation,\u201d says the council\u2019s head, Maude Barlow. \u201cBut if we can get the issues out and get more people voting, we can get rid of Harper even if there isn\u2019t any formal coalition ahead of time.\u201d Barlow accuses the Conservatives of hollowing out Canadian civil society, cancelling thousands of programmes, rescinding grants, removing regulations, shutting institutions and rescinding the tax-exempt status of annoying charities. \u201cThey don\u2019t care about us and I don\u2019t believe they try to represent us,\u201d she says. \u201cThey only care about the 35% of the population they want to vote for them.\u201d Even former supporters have joined the attack. The government\u2019s sweeping anti-terror legislation, seen as a political masterstroke when introduced, ultimately inspired a massive outcry that echoed from every establishment pulpit in the country. The government\u2019s more recent attempt to announce clearly unattainable carbon-emission targets \u2013 and its subsequent U-turn inspired derision on both the right and left. Partisan cooperation is unknown in Canadian election campaigns, according to Bob Rae, a senior statesman who served as the NDP premier of Ontario 20 years ago and more recently as the federal Liberal party\u2019s caretaker leader following its 2011 electoral collapse under Michael Ignatieff. \u201cPeople are very determined to maintain the identity of their parties and to maintain their separateness,\u201d Rae says, \u201cand the intensity to do that seems to grow as the ideological differences between the parties becomes less and less significant.\u201d Despite that, Rae adds, there is a long history of Canadian parties cooperating to form governments following less than decisive elections. And despite the reliable perversity of a first-past-the-post electoral system in a multiparty democracy, there\u2019s never any easy way to tell whom it may favour. \u201cFirst-past-the-post is a momentum play,\u201d Rae says. \u201cI think what we\u2019re seeing, particularly with this long campaign, is that it\u2019s quite possible any of the three parties will make a breakthrough.\u201d",

At the same time, it neglects to provide any increased oversight of the country\u2019s vastly empowered chief spy agency, the Canadian Security and Intelligence Service. \u201cThis is not an ordinary bill and this is not about politics anymore,\u201d Green Party leader Elizabeth May told the House of Commons last week. \u201cThis is about the soul of the country and a question of whether we understand what Canada stands for \u2013 for ourselves and what we represent around the world.\u201d Thomas Mulcair, leader of the opposition New Democratic Party, denounced the bill as \u201csweeping, dangerous, vague and ineffective\u201d. But much the same could be said of parliamentary efforts to stop Harper. After promising to support the bill in deference to its apparent popularity, Liberal Party leader Justin Trudeau was easily rebuffed in his call for amendments. Introduced in the wake of two lone-wolf terrorist attacks, one of which killed sentry Nathan Cirillo at the Canadian National War Memorial in Ottawa, the bill gained widespread initial support among ordinary Canadians. But in the weeks of criticism that followed, the polls turned and a majority began to express opposition. It remains to be seen whether their anger will survive to make a difference in the general election this October.",
