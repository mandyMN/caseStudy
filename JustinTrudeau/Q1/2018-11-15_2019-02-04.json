Where the hurricane takes it, though, may be out of the telecoms giant\u2019s control.</p> <p>A slew of bombshell allegations have raised troubling questions about the telecoms company\u2019s probity and revived long-held concerns about its relationship with China\u2019s intelligence services. The UK, in need of friends as Brexit looms, is struggling to negotiate the fallout.

My view is that we want the benefits of Chinese technology and inward investment and we should find ways of managing the risks, pushing back where necessary.\u201d</p> <p>Last Monday <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/chinese-telecommunications-conglomerate-huawei-and-huawei-cfo-wanzhou-meng-charged\" title=\"\">a 13-count indictment unsealed in a New York court,</a> charging Huawei and its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, with Iranian sanctions-busting \u2013 charges rejected by the company \u2013 made the balancing act that bit more difficult. A second indictment, unveiled the same day, alleged<a href=\"http://\" title=\"\"> that the firm tried to steal technology from</a> mobile operator T-Mobile US. Huawei insists the matter has been settled.</p> <p>It was just another bad week for a company that is making a habit of garnering negative headlines. Not a week goes by without a UK politician taking aim. Defence secretary Gavin Williamson expressed \u201cgrave concerns\u201d about Huawei in December. Last week Chris Bryant, the Labour MP and member of the foreign affairs select committee, claimed: \u201cDay by day we see more evidence that Chinese companies like Huawei are breaking all the rules and undermining British security.\u201d In December a Huawei executive was arrested in Poland on charges of spying for China, a dramatic development that the company insisted had nothing to do with its operations, a rebuttal that did little to convince sceptics who view it as an appendage of China\u2019s Communist party (CCP).</p> <p>While Huawei likes to portray itself as an independent enterprise wholly owned by its employees (\u201cwe\u2019re the John Lewis of China,\u201d one claimed), no Chinese company could succeed abroad so spectacularly without the party\u2019s patronage, said Martin Thorley, an expert on international engagement with China at the University of Nottingham. \u201cThere are a growing number of exciting Chinese companies that could compete abroad in a range of sectors, but the CCP has made it\u2019s choice, and it has chosen to retain power in all spheres to the detriment of these companies\u2019 international aspirations.\u201d</p> <p>For westerners who struggle to understand the power of CCP patronage, Thorley offers an analogy. \u201cImagine if the Conservative party in the UK controlled the army, the judiciary, all newspapers, the police force, major companies, all universities. It would be a very different country indeed.</p> <p>\u201cHuawei is a part of this network and subject to these forces, so the question is whether a company ultimately subject to the whim of the CCP should be involved in sensitive security projects abroad. Some may argue that it should but they need to understand that when called upon Huawei must do as the party says.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b865cacccbb6259b146e66c178ca26f37692ca69\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b865cacccbb6259b146e66c178ca26f37692ca69/0_0_5000_3542/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou\" width=\"1000\" height=\"708\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou faces a 13-count indictment.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Darryl Dyck/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the UK, however, Huawei has gone to great lengths to present itself as a paragon of corporate accountability. It hired the government\u2019s chief information officer, John Suffolk, as head of cybersecurity and its UK board is the envy of many FTSE 100 firms. Notable appointments include ex-BP boss Lord Browne of Madingley, Sir Andrew Cahn, the government\u2019s former chief trade ambassador, and, until her death in 2017, Dame Helen Alexander, a former CBI president.</p> <p>In addition to the links it has forged with academia, the company is a donor to the Chatham House thinktank and has funded two influential parliamentary technology committees. A former global sponsor of Arsenal football club, Huawei will achieve a rare PR coup on Monday when an unfinished symphony by Schubert, completed using the company\u2019s smartphone technology, will be performed for the first time at London\u2019s Cadogan Hall.</p> <p>But its expert deployment of soft power cannot stanch the flow of bad publicity. Amid growing disquiet about Huawei\u2019s activities, UK operator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/dec/05/bt-removing-huawei-equipment-from-parts-of-4g-network\" title=\"\">BT has announced that it will remove Huawei\u2019s technology</a> from parts of a network it acquired from a rival, a move that some suggested was down to security concerns. Last week Vodafone confirmed that it was restricting its involvement with Huawei in the UK. Huawei is already barred from supplying next-generation 5G equipment \u2013 the technology that will connect \u201cthe internet of things\u201d \u2013 to Australia and New Zealand.</p> <p>Company insiders insist these developments have nothing to do with security issues, but the optics don\u2019t look good and several UK institutions have taken fright as the charges have piled up. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/17/oxford-places-ban-on-donations-and-research-grants-from-huawei-chinese-national-security\" title=\"\">Oxford University</a> and the Prince\u2019s Trust, two venerable organisations that have received Huawei funding, have broken links with the company in the last few days. Some 19 UK universities still enjoy Huawei sponsorship, but, given events, they may now be reconsidering their positions.</p> <p>More bad news is to come, on both sides of the Atlantic. The <em>Observer </em>understands a report to be presented to parliament\u2019s intelligence and security committee in the coming months will flag further concerns about the use of Huawei\u2019s software in the UK telecoms networks, something that will be seized upon by the company\u2019s critics, who warn that sensitive data generated in the UK is at risk of being re-routed to China.</p> <p>In the US, alongside its broader attack on Chinese imports, the Trump administration wants to ban US companies from using Chinese equipment in their critical telecoms networks. Some believe the administration\u2019s ultimate goal is to push Huawei out of Europe and the US, leaving America to frame the global standards for 5G.</p> <p>Behind the scenes, some see a level of coordination in the way the US and its allies have been gunning for Huawei. \u201cEach week there\u2019s a new hit,\u201d one seasoned Huawei watcher observed. \u201cIt\u2019s really quite impressive, from a PR perspective.\u201d</p> <p>As China has pushed back, for one person at least the geopolitical row has become a matter of life and death. Following Meng\u2019s arrest in Canada at the request of the US, the Chinese authorities seized two Canadians and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/14/china-sentences-canadian-man-death-drug-charges-robert-lloyd-schellenberg\" title=\"\">sentenced to death a third man, Robert Schellenberg</a>, who had initially been sentenced to 15 years in prison. The decision prompted the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, to accuse China of \u201carbitrarily\u201d applying the death sentence.</p> <p>In a rare meeting with journalists last month, a sign the company knows it needs to halt the flow of negative headlines, Meng\u2019s father, the company\u2019s founder, Ren Zhengfei, insisted the decision was \u201cnot related to Huawei in any way\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe are like a small sesame seed, stuck in the middle of conflict between two great powers,\u201d said Ren during the round-table discussion, a transcript of which has been shared with the <em>Observer.</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"90bda1ce6b44980b7ac7a4dc45fa3c1840123cb3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/90bda1ce6b44980b7ac7a4dc45fa3c1840123cb3/0_0_3500_2334/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chinese president Xi Jinping and president Donald Trump.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chinese president Xi Jinping and president Donald Trump. The US and China are locked in a bitter trade war.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlos Barria/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Not that small a seed. With 180,000 staff around the world (1,500 in the UK), Huawei produced revenues last year of more than $100bn. In 2017 it invested $13bn (\u00a310bn) in research and development, half what the UK spent. Not bad for a company founded in a small flat with a $2,500 loan barely more than 20 years ago. Curiously, as the row over Huawei\u2019s activities has sucked in each of the UK\u2019s intelligence-sharing partners in the so-called \u201cFive Eyes\u201d spying alliance \u2013 the US, Australia, New Zealand and Canada \u2013 Theresa May\u2019s government has been strangely quiet about its position. But then, to be seen taking up the cudgels against Huawei would be to risk unpicking the years of work that the UK has spent assiduously wooing China.</p> <p>The dividends of this courtship are manifold. Between 2016 and 2017, Chinese investment in the UK doubled to $20.8bn, according to a report produced by the TMF Group, a consultancy, on behalf of the China-Britain Business Council. This was all the more astonishing given that, in the same year, overall Chinese outbound investment declined for the first time since records began in 2003.</p> <p>More is to come. Between 2018 and 2022, Huawei alone has pledged to spend some \u00a33bn in the UK. It is perhaps no coincidence that, as Chinese money has poured into the UK, hundreds of Chinese investors have received golden visas granting them residency. And nowhere is the burgeoning Anglo-Chinese relationship more tangible than London.</p> <p>Two of the City\u2019s most recognisable buildings, the 224m \u201cCheesegrater\u201d and the 38-storey Walkie Talkie, are now owned by Hong Kong companies, while the multibillion-pound redevelopment of the Royal Albert Dock in east London is being spearheaded by the Chinese developer ABP.</p> <p>These projects pale into insignificance compared with the \u00a320bn development of Hinkley Point C. The new nuclear station in Somerset that will generate low-carbon electricity for about 6 million homes is a third-owned by China\u2019s General Nuclear Power Group.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Huawei\u2019s cyber-security approach fell short but no hostile Chinese state activity was uncovered</p> <footer> <cite>Robert Hannigan, ex-GCHQ</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But some experts question where this relationship will end. \u201cMy fear is that, just as financial elite influence over government ensured light-touch regulation that led to financial disaster in 2008, so similar interests have steered the UK government towards the \u2018golden era\u2019 policy with China,\u201d Thorley said. \u201cThis policy has stalled somewhat since David Cameron and George Osborne left Downing Street, but we still may feel its consequences in the UK\u2019s energy strategy and beyond.\u201d</p> <p>The UK\u2019s assiduous courtship of China was evident in 2010 when Cameron set up his National Security Council, comprising eight committees, six of which he headed. Significantly, though, of the other two, the one relating to cybersecurity was to be overseen not by the prime minister but by the chancellor.</p> <p>At the time intelligence experts were quick to interpret this shift. One told the <em>Observer</em> that they believed the Treasury wanted to \u201cown\u201d cyber because it believed the opportunities afforded by the development of the technology should not be subsumed beneath national security concerns, a view that at the time alarmed some in the intelligence community.</p> <p>And for good reason. Under article 7 of China\u2019s 2017 National Intelligence law, companies like Huawei are legally obliged to help the Chinese intelligence agencies upon request. This fact alone might convince many that Huawei should be nowhere near the UK\u2019s critical infrastructure.</p> <p>But Huawei is subject to unique supervision by the UK\u2019s intelligence services. In 2010 the UK government established the Huawei Cyber Security Evaluation centre, overseen by GCHQ\u2019s national cybersecurity centre, to monitor the company\u2019s operations in the UK.</p> <p>Staffed by 35 heavily vetted analysts, the centre flags security issues arising from Huawei\u2019s activities to government. A report issued by the centre\u2019s <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/727415/20180717_HCSEC_Oversight_Board_Report_2018_-_FINAL.pdf\" title=\"\">oversight board last July raised serious concerns</a> about the poor quality of Huawei\u2019s security engineering. As a result, the board conceded that it could provide only \u201climited assurance\u201d that any risks to UK national security from Huawei\u2019s involvement in the UK\u2019s critical networks had been sufficiently mitigated.</p> <p>Another report from the board, to be published this spring, is expected to raise similar concerns, giving more ammunition to Huawei\u2019s critics, the <em>Observer</em> understands. However, while the intelligence agencies may harbour concerns about the robustness of Huawei\u2019s software, the centre has never found evidence of the fabled \u201cbackdoors\u201d that would allow China to penetrate the UK\u2019s telecoms networks. \u201cCritically, it has concluded that Huawei falls short in its approach to cybersecurity, but it has never uncovered hostile state activity by Chinese government agencies,\u201d Hannigan said.</p> <p>Ren, a former officer in the People\u2019s Liberation Army, insists Huawei would never betray its customers. \u201cWhen it comes to cybersecurity and privacy protection, we are committed to siding with our customers. We will never harm any nation or any individual.\u201d</p> <p>The extraordinary level to which the UK has gone to accommodate a company regularly accused of spying for a foreign state says much about where the shifting balance of power now lies in the world. In the era of \u201ctechno-nationalism\u201d, countries that innovate dominate.</p> <p>Last year the broadband comparison <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">website, Cable, published an annual league table</a> revealing that the UK had the 35th fastest broadband in the world, a slip of four places since 2017, one that put it behind almost all other EU member states and Madagascar, one of the least developed nations in the world, according to the UN. Huawei knows it is one of the very few companies that can drag the UK up the table. \u201cHuawei is the only company in the world that can integrate 5G base stations with the most advanced microwave technology,\u201d Ren said.</p> <p>\u201cWith that capability, our 5G base stations don\u2019t even need fibre connections. Instead, they can use superfast microwave to support ultra-wide bandwidth backhauls. This is a compelling solution that makes a lot of economic sense.\u201d For economic, read cheap.</p> <p>To switch to an alternative supplier, such as Sweden\u2019s Ericsson, would be hugely costly, Whitehall mandarins concede. Inevitably, the significantly higher prices would be passed on to consumers.</p> <p>Jo Platt, shadow minister for cyber, said UK reliance on a few key tech firms was a concern. \u201cWhy are we spending huge amounts of public money on mega-companies like Amazon Digital Services and Huawei; how do we redress that?\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps Huawei itself will provide the answer. Amid reports that Poland is pushing fellow Nato members to adopt a \u201cunified position\u201d on Huawei, something that could make life difficult for the UK as it scrambles to keep Huawei onside, Ren promised the company would scale back if it was not allowed to sell its products in certain markets. Such a pledge would never be made by a western company beholden to shareholders. But, as Ren acknowledged, Huawei is different. \u201cWe are not a public company \u2013 we aren\u2019t overly concerned about beautiful numbers.\u201d He was talking about Huawei. But he may as well have been talking about China.</p> <p><em><strong>22 August 2018</strong></em></p> <p><em>The US issues a warrant for Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of Huawei and daughter of its founder, Ren Zhengfei</em></p> <p><em><strong>1 December </strong>Meng Wanzhou is arrested at Vancouver airport after US says Huawei was involved in breaking Iran sanctions</em></p> <p><em><strong>10 December</strong></em></p> <p><em>Two Canadians are detained in China, four days after Justin Trudeau refuses to intervene in Meng\u2019s case</em></p> <p><em><strong>14 January 2019</strong></em></p> <p><em>Canadian Robert Lloyd Schellenberg is sentenced to death by a Chinese court for drug smuggling</em></p> <p><em><strong>24 January</strong></em></p> <p><em>Huawei says it will not use US-made components for its next generation of smartphones</em></p> <p><em><strong>28 January</strong></em></p> <p><em>Meng is charged with misleading US banks about Iran dealings.

While Huawei likes to portray itself as an independent enterprise wholly owned by its employees (\u201cwe\u2019re the John Lewis of China,\u201d one claimed), no Chinese company could succeed abroad so spectacularly without the party\u2019s patronage, said Martin Thorley, an expert on international engagement with China at the University of Nottingham. \u201cThere are a growing number of exciting Chinese companies that could compete abroad in a range of sectors, but the CCP has made it\u2019s choice, and it has chosen to retain power in all spheres to the detriment of these companies\u2019 international aspirations.\u201d For westerners who struggle to understand the power of CCP patronage, Thorley offers an analogy. \u201cImagine if the Conservative party in the UK controlled the army, the judiciary, all newspapers, the police force, major companies, all universities. It would be a very different country indeed. \u201cHuawei is a part of this network and subject to these forces, so the question is whether a company ultimately subject to the whim of the CCP should be involved in sensitive security projects abroad. Some may argue that it should but they need to understand that when called upon Huawei must do as the party says.\u201d In the UK, however, Huawei has gone to great lengths to present itself as a paragon of corporate accountability. It hired the government\u2019s chief information officer, John Suffolk, as head of cybersecurity and its UK board is the envy of many FTSE 100 firms. Notable appointments include ex-BP boss Lord Browne of Madingley, Sir Andrew Cahn, the government\u2019s former chief trade ambassador, and, until her death in 2017, Dame Helen Alexander, a former CBI president. In addition to the links it has forged with academia, the company is a donor to the Chatham House thinktank and has funded two influential parliamentary technology committees. A former global sponsor of Arsenal football club, Huawei will achieve a rare PR coup on Monday when an unfinished symphony by Schubert, completed using the company\u2019s smartphone technology, will be performed for the first time at London\u2019s Cadogan Hall. But its expert deployment of soft power cannot stanch the flow of bad publicity. Amid growing disquiet about Huawei\u2019s activities, UK operator BT has announced that it will remove Huawei\u2019s technology from parts of a network it acquired from a rival, a move that some suggested was down to security concerns. Last week Vodafone confirmed that it was restricting its involvement with Huawei in the UK. Huawei is already barred from supplying next-generation 5G equipment \u2013 the technology that will connect \u201cthe internet of things\u201d \u2013 to Australia and New Zealand. Company insiders insist these developments have nothing to do with security issues, but the optics don\u2019t look good and several UK institutions have taken fright as the charges have piled up. Oxford University and the Prince\u2019s Trust, two venerable organisations that have received Huawei funding, have broken links with the company in the last few days. Some 19 UK universities still enjoy Huawei sponsorship, but, given events, they may now be reconsidering their positions. More bad news is to come, on both sides of the Atlantic. The Observer understands a report to be presented to parliament\u2019s intelligence and security committee in the coming months will flag further concerns about the use of Huawei\u2019s software in the UK telecoms networks, something that will be seized upon by the company\u2019s critics, who warn that sensitive data generated in the UK is at risk of being re-routed to China. In the US, alongside its broader attack on Chinese imports, the Trump administration wants to ban US companies from using Chinese equipment in their critical telecoms networks. Some believe the administration\u2019s ultimate goal is to push Huawei out of Europe and the US, leaving America to frame the global standards for 5G. Behind the scenes, some see a level of coordination in the way the US and its allies have been gunning for Huawei. \u201cEach week there\u2019s a new hit,\u201d one seasoned Huawei watcher observed. \u201cIt\u2019s really quite impressive, from a PR perspective.\u201d As China has pushed back, for one person at least the geopolitical row has become a matter of life and death. Following Meng\u2019s arrest in Canada at the request of the US, the Chinese authorities seized two Canadians and sentenced to death a third man, Robert Schellenberg, who had initially been sentenced to 15 years in prison. The decision prompted the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, to accuse China of \u201carbitrarily\u201d applying the death sentence. In a rare meeting with journalists last month, a sign the company knows it needs to halt the flow of negative headlines, Meng\u2019s father, the company\u2019s founder, Ren Zhengfei, insisted the decision was \u201cnot related to Huawei in any way\u201d. \u201cWe are like a small sesame seed, stuck in the middle of conflict between two great powers,\u201d said Ren during the round-table discussion, a transcript of which has been shared with the Observer. Not that small a seed. With 180,000 staff around the world (1,500 in the UK), Huawei produced revenues last year of more than $100bn. In 2017 it invested $13bn (\u00a310bn) in research and development, half what the UK spent. Not bad for a company founded in a small flat with a $2,500 loan barely more than 20 years ago. Curiously, as the row over Huawei\u2019s activities has sucked in each of the UK\u2019s intelligence-sharing partners in the so-called \u201cFive Eyes\u201d spying alliance \u2013 the US, Australia, New Zealand and Canada \u2013 Theresa May\u2019s government has been strangely quiet about its position. But then, to be seen taking up the cudgels against Huawei would be to risk unpicking the years of work that the UK has spent assiduously wooing China. The dividends of this courtship are manifold. Between 2016 and 2017, Chinese investment in the UK doubled to $20.8bn, according to a report produced by the TMF Group, a consultancy, on behalf of the China-Britain Business Council. This was all the more astonishing given that, in the same year, overall Chinese outbound investment declined for the first time since records began in 2003. More is to come. Between 2018 and 2022, Huawei alone has pledged to spend some \u00a33bn in the UK. It is perhaps no coincidence that, as Chinese money has poured into the UK, hundreds of Chinese investors have received golden visas granting them residency. And nowhere is the burgeoning Anglo-Chinese relationship more tangible than London. Two of the City\u2019s most recognisable buildings, the 224m \u201cCheesegrater\u201d and the 38-storey Walkie Talkie, are now owned by Hong Kong companies, while the multibillion-pound redevelopment of the Royal Albert Dock in east London is being spearheaded by the Chinese developer ABP. These projects pale into insignificance compared with the \u00a320bn development of Hinkley Point C. The new nuclear station in Somerset that will generate low-carbon electricity for about 6 million homes is a third-owned by China\u2019s General Nuclear Power Group. But some experts question where this relationship will end. \u201cMy fear is that, just as financial elite influence over government ensured light-touch regulation that led to financial disaster in 2008, so similar interests have steered the UK government towards the \u2018golden era\u2019 policy with China,\u201d Thorley said. \u201cThis policy has stalled somewhat since David Cameron and George Osborne left Downing Street, but we still may feel its consequences in the UK\u2019s energy strategy and beyond.\u201d The UK\u2019s assiduous courtship of China was evident in 2010 when Cameron set up his National Security Council, comprising eight committees, six of which he headed. Significantly, though, of the other two, the one relating to cybersecurity was to be overseen not by the prime minister but by the chancellor. At the time intelligence experts were quick to interpret this shift. One told the Observer that they believed the Treasury wanted to \u201cown\u201d cyber because it believed the opportunities afforded by the development of the technology should not be subsumed beneath national security concerns, a view that at the time alarmed some in the intelligence community. And for good reason. Under article 7 of China\u2019s 2017 National Intelligence law, companies like Huawei are legally obliged to help the Chinese intelligence agencies upon request. This fact alone might convince many that Huawei should be nowhere near the UK\u2019s critical infrastructure. But Huawei is subject to unique supervision by the UK\u2019s intelligence services. In 2010 the UK government established the Huawei Cyber Security Evaluation centre, overseen by GCHQ\u2019s national cybersecurity centre, to monitor the company\u2019s operations in the UK. Staffed by 35 heavily vetted analysts, the centre flags security issues arising from Huawei\u2019s activities to government. A report issued by the centre\u2019s oversight board last July raised serious concerns about the poor quality of Huawei\u2019s security engineering. As a result, the board conceded that it could provide only \u201climited assurance\u201d that any risks to UK national security from Huawei\u2019s involvement in the UK\u2019s critical networks had been sufficiently mitigated. Another report from the board, to be published this spring, is expected to raise similar concerns, giving more ammunition to Huawei\u2019s critics, the Observer understands. However, while the intelligence agencies may harbour concerns about the robustness of Huawei\u2019s software, the centre has never found evidence of the fabled \u201cbackdoors\u201d that would allow China to penetrate the UK\u2019s telecoms networks. \u201cCritically, it has concluded that Huawei falls short in its approach to cybersecurity, but it has never uncovered hostile state activity by Chinese government agencies,\u201d Hannigan said. Ren, a former officer in the People\u2019s Liberation Army, insists Huawei would never betray its customers. \u201cWhen it comes to cybersecurity and privacy protection, we are committed to siding with our customers. We will never harm any nation or any individual.\u201d The extraordinary level to which the UK has gone to accommodate a company regularly accused of spying for a foreign state says much about where the shifting balance of power now lies in the world. In the era of \u201ctechno-nationalism\u201d, countries that innovate dominate. Last year the broadband comparison website, Cable, published an annual league table revealing that the UK had the 35th fastest broadband in the world, a slip of four places since 2017, one that put it behind almost all other EU member states and Madagascar, one of the least developed nations in the world, according to the UN. Huawei knows it is one of the very few companies that can drag the UK up the table. \u201cHuawei is the only company in the world that can integrate 5G base stations with the most advanced microwave technology,\u201d Ren said. \u201cWith that capability, our 5G base stations don\u2019t even need fibre connections. Instead, they can use superfast microwave to support ultra-wide bandwidth backhauls. This is a compelling solution that makes a lot of economic sense.\u201d For economic, read cheap. To switch to an alternative supplier, such as Sweden\u2019s Ericsson, would be hugely costly, Whitehall mandarins concede. Inevitably, the significantly higher prices would be passed on to consumers. Jo Platt, shadow minister for cyber, said UK reliance on a few key tech firms was a concern. \u201cWhy are we spending huge amounts of public money on mega-companies like Amazon Digital Services and Huawei; how do we redress that?\u201d Perhaps Huawei itself will provide the answer. Amid reports that Poland is pushing fellow Nato members to adopt a \u201cunified position\u201d on Huawei, something that could make life difficult for the UK as it scrambles to keep Huawei onside, Ren promised the company would scale back if it was not allowed to sell its products in certain markets. Such a pledge would never be made by a western company beholden to shareholders. But, as Ren acknowledged, Huawei is different. \u201cWe are not a public company \u2013 we aren\u2019t overly concerned about beautiful numbers.\u201d He was talking about Huawei. But he may as well have been talking about China. 22 August 2018 The US issues a warrant for Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of Huawei and daughter of its founder, Ren Zhengfei 1 December Meng Wanzhou is arrested at Vancouver airport after US says Huawei was involved in breaking Iran sanctions 10 December Two Canadians are detained in China, four days after Justin Trudeau refuses to intervene in Meng\u2019s case 14 January 2019 Canadian Robert Lloyd Schellenberg is sentenced to death by a Chinese court for drug smuggling 24 January Huawei says it will not use US-made components for its next generation of smartphones 28 January Meng is charged with misleading US banks about Iran dealings.

          "bodyText": "The wife of the Bahraini footballer and refugee Hakeem al-Araibi has written to leaders in Canada and New Zealand, telling them \u201ctime is running out\u201d and pleading with them to help him return to Australia. Al-Araibi, an Australian resident, has been detained in Thailand, where he had gone on honeymoon, for more than two months while Bahrain seeks his extradition. He was arrested in Bangkok in November on a red notice wrongly issued to Bahrain by Interpol in contravention of its own refugee protection policies. He faces a 10-year prison sentence in Bahrain for a vandalism conviction that has been widely discredited. His wife, who does not want to be named, spent the first 10 days of his detention sharing a cell with him but has since had to return to Australia. In a letter to the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, al-Araibi\u2019s wife pleaded with him to put pressure on the Thai authorities to release him. \u201cTime is running out, and I am pleading desperately to you as a humanitarian, and someone who would not hesitate to stand with justice, please please help my husband,\u201d she wrote, citing Canada\u2019s swift offer of resettlement to the Saudi refugee Rahaf al-Qunun. \u201cHis refugee status relates to his persecution in Bahrain. This in itself should be sufficient to showcase the inhumanity of extraditing him back to Bahrain, let alone the fact that it is illegal.\u201d Her plea came as the Asian Football Confederation, widely criticised for its failure to lobby on al-Araibi\u2019s behalf, despite its Bahraini president and strong leverage with Thailand, finally called for the player\u2019s release. The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, wrote to his Thai counterpart to push for al-Araibi\u2019s release for the first time last week, adding to pressure brought by Australia\u2019s foreign affairs minister over the previous two months. On Monday, Bahrain lodged its formal extradition application with a Thai court, a week ahead of its 8 February deadline. In a separate letter to the New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, al-Araibi\u2019s wife described how their honeymoon turned into a nightmare. \u201cMy husband is going through the hardest days of his life all these 60 days,\u201d she wrote. In her letters to both the Canadian and New Zealand leaders, she said the \u201cillegal refoulement\u201d sought by Bahrain would put al-Araibi\u2019s life \u201cin certain danger of persecution, imprisonment and possible death\u201d. \u201cI am terrified that the final decision to deport him will take place within the next few days.\u201d Multiple governments, human rights groups and world football bodies have lobbied for al-Araibi\u2019s release. Australia\u2019s foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, has publicly and privately put pressure on Thailand to release him, including during a ministerial visit to the country, and again in public statements on Tuesday afternoon. However, football bodies have been criticised for being slow to join the efforts, in particular the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) and its Bahraini royal president, Sheikh Salman bin Ibrahim al-Khalifa. On Tuesday, 63 days after al-Araibi was first arrested and three days after the AFC suddenly announced that al-Khalifa had been recused from regional responsibilities 18 months ago, it pleaded directly with the Thai prime minister for his release. The request for \u201cimmediate intervention\u201d from the AFC vice president to allow al-Araibi\u2019s return to Australia came after Bahrain lodged its extradition papers, setting a Thai court process in motion. On Tuesday, Morrison\u2019s office confirmed he wrote to Thailand\u2019s prime minister, Prayuth Chan-o-cha, last week, to emphasise al-Araibi\u2019s refugee status in Australia, and said that returning him to Bahrain would infringe on his human rights under international law. There remain multiple questions about the role of Australian authorities in al-Araibi\u2019s detention, including how the issuing of a red notice against someone to whom Australia had given refugee status went unnoticed. The Australian federal police is also facing questions after notifying Thailand of al-Araibi\u2019s travel plans. Al-Araibi has said he specifically asked Australian authorities if he was safe to travel to Thailand and was told he was. On Monday, Bahrain\u2019s interior minister, Shaikh Rashid bin Abdullah Al Khalifa, defended his government\u2019s pursuit of al-Araibi, saying concerns he would face torture and unjust imprisonment if he was returned were \u201cfalse reports\u201d. \u201cThe external interference in the internal affairs of Bahrain is unacceptable,\u201d he said. \u201cThose raising unfounded doubts about the integrity and independence of the kingdom\u2019s judicial system are not only interfering but also attempting to influence the course of justice.\u201d In response, human rights groups have pointed to multiple investigations and reports on the torture and mistreatment of prisoners and targeting of opposition figures by the Bahraini justice system.",

Richard Fadden, who served as the head of the security intelligence service spy from 2009 to 2013, cited what he said was mounting evidence for blocking Huawei. \u201cCanada\u2019s government should ignore the threats and ban Huawei from Canada\u2019s 5G networks to protect the security of Canadians,\u201d he wrote in the Globe and Mail.",

          "bodyText": "China\u2019s sentencing of a Canadian to death for drug trafficking threatens to escalate tensions between the two countries and set a dangerous precedent, according to experts. On Monday, the Dalian Intermediate People\u2019s Court in the northeastern province of Liaoning increased Robert Schellenberg\u2019s sentence from 15 years in prison to the death penalty, concluding the Canadian had played \u201ca key role\u201d in a failed attempt to smuggle 222kg (almost 500lbs) of methamphetamine from China to Australia in 2014. The verdict has raised questions about whether Beijing is using the case to exert pressure on Ottawa after Canadian authorities detained senior Huawei executive, Meng Wanzhou, in December. \u201cWe\u2019re at a juncture where the case could proceed quite expeditiously if Beijing so chooses,\u201d said Maggie Lewis, a professor of law and expert in Chinese law at Seton Hall University in New Jersey. According to Lewis there are several points where Chinese authorities can stop or slow the process, or speed it up. \u201cIf Beijing wants to put the screws on, it could keep this case going forward in a rapid fire manner as we\u2019ve seen since the December appeal, or the government could press the pause button, or just slow down the pace.\u201d Schellenberg has 10 days to appeal the death penalty. If he doesn\u2019t, or if the appeal is rejected, then the court\u2019s verdict would go to the Supreme People\u2019s Court in Beijing. If they approve it, the execution could happen within seven days, but the court could also reduce the sentence.

Last summer, a tweet in Arabic, sent by Global Affairs Canada, set off a diplomatic row between the two nations, in which Canadian diplomats were expelled from the kingdom, Saudi students in Canada were recalled and the Saudi government sold numerous Canadian equities and currency holdings.",

          "bodyText": "Justin Trudeau was in campaign mode this week, striding around a school gymnasium, shirtsleeves rolled up and brow suitably furrowed as he addressed voters\u2019 concerns at one of his annual town hall-style meetings. A day earlier and nearly 800km away, another face of the federal government was on display as dozens of police \u2013 some heavily armed \u2013 stormed a makeshift barricade, arresting 14 indigenous protesters and prompting others to flee for safety on snowmobiles. The protesters in northern British Columbia had camped out for days amid bitter cold and deep snow, manning a checkpoint to prevent construction vehicles from entering the territory of the Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en nation. Their demonstrations, part of a fight against a multibillion-dollar natural gas pipeline, galvanized supporters across the country, and at his town hall meeting, the prime minister was forced to contend with a barrage of angry questions. The standoff ended on Wednesday night, in a temporary truce between leadership and police. But the dramatic scenes highlighted a broader issue for Canada in 2019: swaths of territory \u2013 never signed away by treaty or seized in war \u2013 still belong to indigenous nations who are fighting back against resource projects they say they never consented to. Unlike the rest of the country \u2013 where relationships between indigenous groups and the state are governed by treaties \u2013 few indigenous nations in British Columbia ever signed deals with colonial authorities, meaning the federal government still operates in a vacuum of authority on their lands, said Gordon Christie, a scholar of indigenous law at the University of British Columbia \u201cWhat I see is a long history of the Canadian government doing its best to avoid acknowledging the existence of other systems of government,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Crown has itself acknowledged that the way it gets authority over territory is through the making of a treaty,\u201d said Christie. \u201cSo this is their problem.\u201d In recent months, tensions with indigenous peoples have flared across Canada as energy companies seek to construct projects on and through indigenous lands. Both TransCanada, which is attempting to build the Coastal GasLink pipeline and Kinder Morgan, which was pushing the TransMountain pipeline, have faced fierce opposition from indigenous groups.

I would have to say to him, is this what reconciliation looks like?\u201d said Wickham, whose sister Molly was arrested on Monday when police raided the protest camp. The site was first occupied by indigenous protesters in 2009 and now hosts a complex of buildings, including a traditional healing lodge. Freda Huson, who has lived there for nearly a decade said that for generations the community has lost land to farming and resource development and now fears that the pipeline could taint the only available drinking water in the area. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have to be dragged into the courts to prove that I own land that I know is ours. Our people owned these territories since time immemorial,\u201d she said. Trudeau pledged to overhaul the framework guiding relations with indigenous communities nearly a year ago. But in areas where no treaties were signed, the courts have often become the arbiter of land claims. In 2014, the Tsilhqot\u2019in people in British Columbia won a longstanding battle over title rights at the country\u2019s highest court \u2013 but at a cost of more than $10m. Both Huson and Wickham believe Canadian law is inadequately equipped to handle land claims fights with the government. In 1997 the supreme court put an end to one of the longest-running legal battles in Canadian history, ruling that the Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en had effectively demonstrated clear title to their land. The plaintiffs exhausted more than an estimated $25m on legal fees \u2013 only to have a retrial called, leaving uncertainty around their claim. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter which route we take. We took this to the highest court in the Canada and it was ruled in our favour,\u201d said Wickham. \u201cEven when we follow their western law, it doesn\u2019t do us any good.\u201d Both the federal government and British Columbia have pledged to implement the United Nations declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples (UNdrip). But Christie argues that until there is a fundamental shift in government attitudes, similar feuds will continue erupt. \u201cThe Canada government [could] change its stance and just acknowledge that these other systems of government have been around for a long period of time,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd treaty-making is the way to manage that.\u201d Huson said: \u201cWe\u2019re in the right. We\u2019re not doing anything wrong. This is my home. This is my land. They want to break down my door.\u201d",

          "body": "<p>When Pita Taufatofua began the walk towards the stadium at the 2016 Rio Olympics opening ceremony, he was an unknown, unrated athlete from an obscure Pacific island. He would walk back out a global celebrity. Had it not been for a vat of coconut oil and his flair for flag bearing, he could have passed through the Olympic Games unnoticed and unreported.</p> <p>As it was he went rogue, flagrantly disobeying officials who said \u201cplease just wear the suit\u201d, hid a ta\u2019ovala (Tongan mat which is wrapped around the waist) in his backback, nipped out the back and put it on just before the show got started, covered himself in oil, and by the time he had passed the thousands of people lining the streets on the way to the stadium he was going viral. When he stepped into the lights of the stadium waving his flag, articles were already being written about the distractingly shiny Tongan flag bearer and Twitter was melting down. \u201cThe internet came to a grinding halt,\u201d reported Entertainment Tonight.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ba1ad2edc5c917f5993719749219d916b8c25b55\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba1ad2edc5c917f5993719749219d916b8c25b55/0_0_2048_3000/683.jpg\" alt=\"Pita Taufatofua leads his delegation during the opening ceremony of the Rio 2016 Olympic Games\" width=\"683\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pita Taufatofua leads his delegation during the Rio Olympics opening ceremony.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Olivier Morin/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Afterwards, when he was standing on the bus \u201cin my oil\u201d, things \u201cjust went crazy\u201d, he recalls. \u201cYou look at your phone and you can\u2019t keep up with it.\u201d</p> <p>He was, he says, completely unprepared. There was no management, no sponsors, no money, no products, just him and his coach, Paul Sitapa. \u201cIt was the first time I heard about what a manager is, what a publicist is, what an agent is. It was just me and my coach trying to manage all this. Two people who didn\u2019t know anything. No one had ever heard of Tonga. We were like, how is this even possible?\u201d</p> <p>Taufatofua says he was just trying to represent his country by wearing its traditional costume. \u201cI was representing 1,000 years of history. We didn\u2019t have suits and ties when we traversed the Pacific Ocean.\u201d</p> <p>If he is being disingenuous (his ancestors probably weren\u2019t oiled up), if he was seeking attention, he got it. He now had the eyes of the world on him for his taekwondo tournament which was right at the end of the Games. \u201cI had to try to stay focused. That was very hard. Now there was more pressure because everyone was watching. They wanted this guy out of nowhere who had this moment to win gold.\u201d </p> <p>He was knocked out in the first round \u2013 16-1 to the Iranian Sajjad Mardani \u2013 but it didn\u2019t really matter because he had already won.</p> <p>By the end of the week there would be 230 million Google searches for \u201cwhere is Tonga?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThose were the stats that were given to us by Google trends,\u201d he says.</p> <p>There would be appearances on US talk shows as he became a darling of the American media.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"397f47d55c3a54d187becccbbe5d7cbaddb0790f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/397f47d55c3a54d187becccbbe5d7cbaddb0790f/0_0_3543_2519/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pita Taufatofua training.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"711\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Taufatofua training.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Kelly/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And there would be a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/dec/06/tongas-olympic-flag-bearer-turns-hand-to-cross-country-skiing\">run at the 2018 Korean winter Olympics in another sport \u2013 cross-country skiing</a>. He had barely even seen snow when he announced this, and it involves an even more dramatic story than the taekwondo tilt. But we will get to that.</p> <h2>\u2018Everything was going wrong\u2019</h2> <p>We meet in Suva where Taufatofua is on duty as the Unicef Pacific ambassador. He has just spent a day <a href=\"http://time.com/5436446/prince-harry-tonga-flag-bearer-pita-taufatofua/\">with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in Tonga</a> and is here to appear on the reality TV show Pacific Island Food Revolution, which is being filmed at the Grand Pacific hotel. Taufatofua wishes the Unicef budget stretched to this luxurious hotel, but unfortunately it doesn\u2019t.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Everything negative in my life has been fuel for me</p> <footer> <cite>Pita Taufatofua</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In person, Taufatofua, 34, is very far from his shirtless beefcake image. He is polite, well-spoken, an educated man with a degree in engineering from the University of Queensland, and a Christian who worked with homeless kids for 15 years at Brisbane Youth Service. The perfect teeth are fairly shiny and the now-famous torso is encased in a blue Unicef T-shirt. But man, does he have a story to tell. He had already won simply by getting to the Olympics. There was no overnight sensation about that. It had taken 15 years and a world of pain. \u201cFrom memory, six broken bones, three torn ligaments, one-and-a-half years on crutches, three months in a wheelchair and just hundreds and hundreds of hours of physiotherapy,\u201d he says.</p> <p>While he is humble, there is no mistaking the strength and self-belief that Taufatofua carries. That and the extraordinary perseverance comes, he says, from \u201cgetting my arse kicked for years, it gave me a whole lot of strength. Everything negative in my life has been fuel for me.\u201d Tenacity comes, he says, \u201cfrom not having anything as a kid\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0abab04131fbcdcbb6698599d4b5b3cb066bc73d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0abab04131fbcdcbb6698599d4b5b3cb066bc73d/0_0_2362_3543/667.jpg\" alt=\"Pita Taufatofua\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Getting my arse kicked for years, it gave me a whole lot of strength.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Kelly/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His mother, who is Australian, was a nurse and is now a sanitation consultant in the South Pacific; his Tongan father has a PhD in agricultural science and worked in government research. He was born in Brisbane but went to school in Tonga. There were seven children and not much money; a one-bedroom house, scarce electricity and no hot water. \u201cThey had no money because they paid for us to have the best education. Between us there are eight degrees and two masters.\u201d</p> <p>In Tonga he was seen as physically smaller than anyone else. He was benched for the entire four years he played football, even though \u201cI never missed a training session. I trained every day,\u201d he says, The only time he got on to the field was to give the other footballers oranges and water. \u201cThe coaches never believed in me. In my head I was the little dog that barked and no one saw the little dog.\u201d</p> <p>When he was five his mother put him into taekwondo for \u201cself-defence, to look after myself. My whole family did it. My brother got his black belt\u201d.</p> <p>When he was 12 the streets from the airport to town were lined with people cheering Paea Wolfgramm, the first Tongan to win an Olympic medal, a silver in boxing at Atlanta in 1996.</p> <p>\u201cThat was when I thought \u2018I am going to the Olympics\u2019. And it just never left,\u201d Taufatofua recalls. \u201cI was working full-time, studying full-time, I was training full-time. It was always \u2018you will be an Olympian\u2019. It is quite an interesting thing.\u201d</p> <p>And so began the years of pain and crushing disappointment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Every four years there is one shot at the Olympics with a qualifying tournament. \u201cI have to be number one in Oceania to qualify for Tonga.\u201d</p> <p>In 2008 he went to the qualifier in New Caledonia and left in a wheelchair.</p> <p>He had been up one point when he sprained an ankle and fractured a bone in his foot, but kept fighting another two rounds until it burst. He was unable to walk for six months.</p> <p>There are no elite sports institutes for Tongan athletes, no vast reserves of government funds for Olympic dreams.</p> <p>In the darkest days he would draw on the homeless kids he worked with. \u201cI saw just what true strength was. We had kids who had been abused in every way possible but were brave enough to get good outcomes. It was just a competition, I didn\u2019t have the right not to believe in myself.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"56da2cd25d9398e94317040d3245b7f45108d499\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/56da2cd25d9398e94317040d3245b7f45108d499/0_0_1981_1456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The room he slept in for six months while training for the Olympics\" width=\"1000\" height=\"735\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The room Taufatofua slept in for six months while training for the Olympic Games.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pita Taufatofua</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2011, getting ready for the London Olympics, he went to train with the taekwondo masters in South Korea, desperately short of funds. \u201cWe slept in a preschool for six months. We slept underneath the desk. Because it was a preschool for church they let us sleep there but in the morning we had to pack up our bags before the kids came in and then go out for the day. We had no money. It was as uncomfortable as anything.\u201d</p> <p>At the world championship in Azerbaijan, which was an Olympic qualifier, he tore a knee ligament, normally a six-month injury. Eight weeks later, not wanting to wait another four years, he made it through to Oceania Olympic qualifier, fighting on one leg. \u201cWe wrapped it as thick as we could. I changed my stance. I fought all the way through to the final. Then I fought against a guy from Samoa who had beaten me before. I was beating him and then in the last round his coach had seen that I was only using one leg and he got up on me and beat me.\u201d This time Taufatofua left New Caledonia on crutches, unable to walk for another three months, while the Samoan went to the Olympics.</p> <p>He kept competing across the Pacific, winning and losing, injury after injury. Surely people were telling him to stop punishing himself. \u201cDoctors, lots of people, told me not to go on. It is really hard to describe just how clear it was in my mind that I will become an Olympian. There was a confidence there that I didn\u2019t create, I believe it was God-given. I can\u2019t explain it other than I just knew it would happen.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cfd2f74c7d571afd0e76fac23b349c2f8603c9e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cfd2f74c7d571afd0e76fac23b349c2f8603c9e1/0_0_3543_2362/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pita Taufatofua.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Doctors, lots of people told me not to go on.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Kelly/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And so to 2016 and Rio. \u201cEverything was going wrong. I was running out of money, my car was breaking down, my relationship was breaking down. Paul calls up and says the [qualifying] competition is in two days we have to get to Papua New Guinea. I am ready but I have no money. Paul called up a lady he knew in Tonga and she funded my first ticket ever. We got there the day before the competition.\u201d</p> <p>Up against a New Zealander who had consistently beaten him, the score was three all at the end of three rounds and went into golden points; the first to get a point wins and becomes an Olympian. And he kicked at exactly the right time. \u201cThat was my moment. It was the most emotional time. Rio, oil, that wasn\u2019t my moment \u2013 that was the reward for all the work.\u201d</p> <p>Four months before the Olympics he was broke. He and Paul did fundraisers and rented a house in Brisbane. They trained in the garage to save money, yelling a lot. \u201cI had my coach, we had prayer, I was happy, I had qualified, I was going,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1557b7df041f85fe71176edd82b2ef69f3f2a543\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1557b7df041f85fe71176edd82b2ef69f3f2a543/0_0_2668_1732/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Iran\u2019s Sajjad Mardani (left) competes against Pita Taufatofua during the men\u2019s taekwondo qualifying bout in the +80kg category at the Rio 2016 Olympics.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"649\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Iran\u2019s Sajjad Mardani (left) competes against Pita Taufatofua during the men\u2019s taekwondo qualifying bout in the over-80kg category at the Rio Olympics.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kirill Kudryavtsev/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018I chose to learn from the failure\u2019</h2> <p>Perhaps it was all the attention, perhaps that kind of energy is addictive, but a few months after Rio he announced that he would attempt the Winter Olympics at Pyeongchang as a cross-country skier.

But I had one year to qualify,\u201d he says. But then he had to qualify on actual snow. And it got real \u2013 on rented skis. \u201cWe had to get to all these countries to try and get the races. I think it was 15 countries in eight weeks. The problem was we had to go to races which were not the hardest races where the world cup winners would be, it would be too hard. At this stage every single athlete from every country was getting ready for the Olympics. I came last in four out of nine races.\u201d</p> <p>He would run up $40,000 in credit card debt.</p> <p>By then he had buddied up with Chilean Yonathan Jes\u00fas Fern\u00e1ndez and Mexican German Madrazo, whose prospects were as farcically bad as his were.</p> <p>None of the ski companies wanted Taufatofua to be seen on their skis. \u201cI was asking for a good price and they looked at me and said \u2018I suggest you wear other skis\u2019. That happened through the whole qualification process, to me and my friends from South America.\u201d</p> <p>In Poland a ski fell off and went flying down a hill and into trees. \u201cI had to go down a hill I had already climbed up, spend 20 minutes looking for it, fix and tape it back on.

But it would be almost impossible to get there in time.</p> <p>\u201cWe looked at every country around Armenia to get a flight. Every country around Croatia. I then end up in an eight-hour taxi ride through Armenia, through the Georgia border, with no sleep. I called the race officials and said I was coming in late. They said they could put me in at the end of the race and then I would start last. I fly across to Istanbul to get a flight to Croatia, and missed the gate by five minutes.

There is no flight from Reykjavik to Eskifj\u00f6r\u00f0ur fjord. So we rented a car. Normally a 10-hour drive.

          "bodyText": "When Pita Taufatofua began the walk towards the stadium at the 2016 Rio Olympics opening ceremony, he was an unknown, unrated athlete from an obscure Pacific island. He would walk back out a global celebrity. Had it not been for a vat of coconut oil and his flair for flag bearing, he could have passed through the Olympic Games unnoticed and unreported. As it was he went rogue, flagrantly disobeying officials who said \u201cplease just wear the suit\u201d, hid a ta\u2019ovala (Tongan mat which is wrapped around the waist) in his backback, nipped out the back and put it on just before the show got started, covered himself in oil, and by the time he had passed the thousands of people lining the streets on the way to the stadium he was going viral. When he stepped into the lights of the stadium waving his flag, articles were already being written about the distractingly shiny Tongan flag bearer and Twitter was melting down. \u201cThe internet came to a grinding halt,\u201d reported Entertainment Tonight. Afterwards, when he was standing on the bus \u201cin my oil\u201d, things \u201cjust went crazy\u201d, he recalls. \u201cYou look at your phone and you can\u2019t keep up with it.\u201d He was, he says, completely unprepared. There was no management, no sponsors, no money, no products, just him and his coach, Paul Sitapa. \u201cIt was the first time I heard about what a manager is, what a publicist is, what an agent is. It was just me and my coach trying to manage all this. Two people who didn\u2019t know anything. No one had ever heard of Tonga. We were like, how is this even possible?\u201d Taufatofua says he was just trying to represent his country by wearing its traditional costume. \u201cI was representing 1,000 years of history. We didn\u2019t have suits and ties when we traversed the Pacific Ocean.\u201d If he is being disingenuous (his ancestors probably weren\u2019t oiled up), if he was seeking attention, he got it. He now had the eyes of the world on him for his taekwondo tournament which was right at the end of the Games. \u201cI had to try to stay focused. That was very hard. Now there was more pressure because everyone was watching. They wanted this guy out of nowhere who had this moment to win gold.\u201d He was knocked out in the first round \u2013 16-1 to the Iranian Sajjad Mardani \u2013 but it didn\u2019t really matter because he had already won. By the end of the week there would be 230 million Google searches for \u201cwhere is Tonga?\u201d \u201cThose were the stats that were given to us by Google trends,\u201d he says. There would be appearances on US talk shows as he became a darling of the American media. And there would be a run at the 2018 Korean winter Olympics in another sport \u2013 cross-country skiing. He had barely even seen snow when he announced this, and it involves an even more dramatic story than the taekwondo tilt. But we will get to that. \u2018Everything was going wrong\u2019 We meet in Suva where Taufatofua is on duty as the Unicef Pacific ambassador. He has just spent a day with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in Tonga and is here to appear on the reality TV show Pacific Island Food Revolution, which is being filmed at the Grand Pacific hotel. Taufatofua wishes the Unicef budget stretched to this luxurious hotel, but unfortunately it doesn\u2019t. In person, Taufatofua, 34, is very far from his shirtless beefcake image. He is polite, well-spoken, an educated man with a degree in engineering from the University of Queensland, and a Christian who worked with homeless kids for 15 years at Brisbane Youth Service. The perfect teeth are fairly shiny and the now-famous torso is encased in a blue Unicef T-shirt. But man, does he have a story to tell. He had already won simply by getting to the Olympics. There was no overnight sensation about that. It had taken 15 years and a world of pain. \u201cFrom memory, six broken bones, three torn ligaments, one-and-a-half years on crutches, three months in a wheelchair and just hundreds and hundreds of hours of physiotherapy,\u201d he says. While he is humble, there is no mistaking the strength and self-belief that Taufatofua carries. That and the extraordinary perseverance comes, he says, from \u201cgetting my arse kicked for years, it gave me a whole lot of strength. Everything negative in my life has been fuel for me.\u201d Tenacity comes, he says, \u201cfrom not having anything as a kid\u201d. His mother, who is Australian, was a nurse and is now a sanitation consultant in the South Pacific; his Tongan father has a PhD in agricultural science and worked in government research. He was born in Brisbane but went to school in Tonga. There were seven children and not much money; a one-bedroom house, scarce electricity and no hot water. \u201cThey had no money because they paid for us to have the best education. Between us there are eight degrees and two masters.\u201d In Tonga he was seen as physically smaller than anyone else. He was benched for the entire four years he played football, even though \u201cI never missed a training session. I trained every day,\u201d he says, The only time he got on to the field was to give the other footballers oranges and water. \u201cThe coaches never believed in me. In my head I was the little dog that barked and no one saw the little dog.\u201d When he was five his mother put him into taekwondo for \u201cself-defence, to look after myself. My whole family did it. My brother got his black belt\u201d. When he was 12 the streets from the airport to town were lined with people cheering Paea Wolfgramm, the first Tongan to win an Olympic medal, a silver in boxing at Atlanta in 1996. \u201cThat was when I thought \u2018I am going to the Olympics\u2019. And it just never left,\u201d Taufatofua recalls. \u201cI was working full-time, studying full-time, I was training full-time. It was always \u2018you will be an Olympian\u2019. It is quite an interesting thing.\u201d And so began the years of pain and crushing disappointment. Every four years there is one shot at the Olympics with a qualifying tournament. \u201cI have to be number one in Oceania to qualify for Tonga.\u201d In 2008 he went to the qualifier in New Caledonia and left in a wheelchair. He had been up one point when he sprained an ankle and fractured a bone in his foot, but kept fighting another two rounds until it burst. He was unable to walk for six months. There are no elite sports institutes for Tongan athletes, no vast reserves of government funds for Olympic dreams. In the darkest days he would draw on the homeless kids he worked with. \u201cI saw just what true strength was. We had kids who had been abused in every way possible but were brave enough to get good outcomes. It was just a competition, I didn\u2019t have the right not to believe in myself.\u201d In 2011, getting ready for the London Olympics, he went to train with the taekwondo masters in South Korea, desperately short of funds. \u201cWe slept in a preschool for six months. We slept underneath the desk. Because it was a preschool for church they let us sleep there but in the morning we had to pack up our bags before the kids came in and then go out for the day. We had no money. It was as uncomfortable as anything.\u201d At the world championship in Azerbaijan, which was an Olympic qualifier, he tore a knee ligament, normally a six-month injury. Eight weeks later, not wanting to wait another four years, he made it through to Oceania Olympic qualifier, fighting on one leg. \u201cWe wrapped it as thick as we could. I changed my stance. I fought all the way through to the final. Then I fought against a guy from Samoa who had beaten me before. I was beating him and then in the last round his coach had seen that I was only using one leg and he got up on me and beat me.\u201d This time Taufatofua left New Caledonia on crutches, unable to walk for another three months, while the Samoan went to the Olympics. He kept competing across the Pacific, winning and losing, injury after injury. Surely people were telling him to stop punishing himself. \u201cDoctors, lots of people, told me not to go on. It is really hard to describe just how clear it was in my mind that I will become an Olympian. There was a confidence there that I didn\u2019t create, I believe it was God-given. I can\u2019t explain it other than I just knew it would happen.\u201d And so to 2016 and Rio. \u201cEverything was going wrong. I was running out of money, my car was breaking down, my relationship was breaking down. Paul calls up and says the [qualifying] competition is in two days we have to get to Papua New Guinea. I am ready but I have no money. Paul called up a lady he knew in Tonga and she funded my first ticket ever. We got there the day before the competition.\u201d Up against a New Zealander who had consistently beaten him, the score was three all at the end of three rounds and went into golden points; the first to get a point wins and becomes an Olympian. And he kicked at exactly the right time. \u201cThat was my moment. It was the most emotional time. Rio, oil, that wasn\u2019t my moment \u2013 that was the reward for all the work.\u201d Four months before the Olympics he was broke. He and Paul did fundraisers and rented a house in Brisbane. They trained in the garage to save money, yelling a lot. \u201cI had my coach, we had prayer, I was happy, I had qualified, I was going,\u201d he says. \u2018I chose to learn from the failure\u2019 Perhaps it was all the attention, perhaps that kind of energy is addictive, but a few months after Rio he announced that he would attempt the Winter Olympics at Pyeongchang as a cross-country skier. As a person who had spent his entire life in the tropics, this seemed hilariously bonkers, up there with the Jamaican bobsledders. \u201cI chose it because it made no sense,\u201d he chuckles. \u201cI love these challenges.\u201d He watched YouTube videos of professional races and at 5am every morning he would put on rollerskis and train in the park. \u201cThe amount of concrete I ate. But I had one year to qualify,\u201d he says. But then he had to qualify on actual snow. And it got real \u2013 on rented skis. \u201cWe had to get to all these countries to try and get the races. I think it was 15 countries in eight weeks. The problem was we had to go to races which were not the hardest races where the world cup winners would be, it would be too hard. At this stage every single athlete from every country was getting ready for the Olympics. I came last in four out of nine races.\u201d He would run up $40,000 in credit card debt. By then he had buddied up with Chilean Yonathan Jes\u00fas Fern\u00e1ndez and Mexican German Madrazo, whose prospects were as farcically bad as his were. None of the ski companies wanted Taufatofua to be seen on their skis. \u201cI was asking for a good price and they looked at me and said \u2018I suggest you wear other skis\u2019. That happened through the whole qualification process, to me and my friends from South America.\u201d In Poland a ski fell off and went flying down a hill and into trees. \u201cI had to go down a hill I had already climbed up, spend 20 minutes looking for it, fix and tape it back on. They were shutting off the lights when I came in,\u201d he recalls. He wasn\u2019t even close to a qualifying time and he was running out of races. \u201cI get across to Armenia. I thought it would be the last race. Two or three thousand metres up. Normally you go there two weeks before to acclimatise. We got there the day before. I got destroyed in the race again. I was devastated. There wasn\u2019t any more time left to qualify.\u201d They found out there was a race in Croatia the next day. But it would be almost impossible to get there in time. \u201cWe looked at every country around Armenia to get a flight. Every country around Croatia. I then end up in an eight-hour taxi ride through Armenia, through the Georgia border, with no sleep. I called the race officials and said I was coming in late. They said they could put me in at the end of the race and then I would start last. I fly across to Istanbul to get a flight to Croatia, and missed the gate by five minutes. I am there pressing all the buttons in the airport, maybe I was a bit crazy by that time. And it didn\u2019t work. I am stuck in Turkey with no money and no flight out of there. I have missed the race in Croatia.\u201d His brother, who is a lawyer, used his points to get him on a flight to London, where he lives. With four days left in the Olympic qualification period, they found out there was one more race \u2013 in Iceland on a fjord in the Arctic Circle. The three amigos bought one-way tickets to Reykjavik, Fern\u00e1ndez and Madrozo flying from Armenia and Taufatofua going courtesy of his brother\u2019s air miles. \u201cWe land, snowstorm. There is no flight from Reykjavik to Eskifj\u00f6r\u00f0ur fjord. So we rented a car. Normally a 10-hour drive. But because of the snowstorm it took us three days,\u201d he says. Then they heard that three avalanches had blocked the road. \u201cI said, \u2018Guys we are going to drive as far as we can and park the car and then hike.\u2019 But by the time we got there they had cleared it, just.\u201d Taufatofua went to the hotel and prayed. Tomorrow was going to be the last day to qualify. He only had one set of skis. \u201cNorway has 40 pairs each. They have a $5m budget just for the waxing. If the conditions were hot or cold, dry or wet, you use a different ski. It just so happened that for what I had it was the perfect day. It was the one race I had where I felt the ski was the right ski. I did the race and qualified with five minutes to spare. And that is how I made my second Olympics.\u201d Naturally he did the oiled shirtless thing at the opening ceremony, even though he risked hypothermia. This time there were no officials to stop him, he was the only athlete from Tonga. And by now the fame was not so accidental. \u201cMy goal was never to be famous because with it comes responsibilities. But what you can do with fame is another thing,\u201d Taufatofua says. There was no question of a medal at these Olympics \u2013 \u201cNo way, not in that sport.\u201d His main goal, he told the media, was \u201cFinish before they turn the lights off. That\u2019s number one. Don\u2019t ski into a tree. That\u2019s number two.\u201d He didn\u2019t even come last. He came in just under 23 minutes behind the gold medal winner Dario Cologna from Switzerland and waited at the finish line for his friends. Today there is something slightly messianic about Pita Taufatofua. \u201cI always chose to learn from the pain and the failure,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt is not special to me, it is something that is transferable to anyone if they have the right mindset. The alternative is to sit down and do nothing with your life and to always feel that there is something else that you should be doing. Everyone has potential. It is whether you act on it or not act on it.\u201d He might never have won an Olympic medal, but Taufatofua has seized the constantly astonishing day. There is management, film and TV offers. He has given a speech at the United Nations general assembly and another at Massachusetts Institute of Technology with Justin Trudeau. He has written a motivation book, The Motivation Station, and another one on depression. \u201cI have my faith and I believe my purpose is bigger than myself. If I am meant to help a million people have confidence, I don\u2019t have the right to be depressed.\u201d Taufatofua says he is too busy to be in a relationship: \u201cI want to make sure that everything I give has to be the best. And I can\u2019t give a relationship the best because I am moving around.\u201d Now a serial Olympian, in late February he will announce his third attempt at an Olympic sport. It will be a water sport this time, but for the moment it is top secret. Watch this space.",

Sitting president Muhammadu Buhari faces a record 78 opposition candidates, some of whom accuse him of failing to deal adequately with corruption.</p> <p>Following an illness earlier this year and five months spent recuperating in London, there have also been bizarre suggestions that he has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/04/nigeria-election-buhari-battles-body-double-rumours-and-economic-woe\">replaced by a body double</a>. That would certainly make campaigning in the world\u2019s seventh most populous country easier.</p> <p>Other major democracies going to the polls include India, where Narendra Modi is seeking a second term, and Indonesia, where the one-term incumbent faces a challenge from yet another rightwing populist candidate.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6105cc83ac90b7fdf1b1f7d9e19abc1b1fc38b49\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6105cc83ac90b7fdf1b1f7d9e19abc1b1fc38b49/0_96_3293_1976/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jair Bolsonaro\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jair Bolsonaro takes office as president of Brazil at the start of January.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marcelo Sayao/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Speaking of rightwing populists, Brazil\u2019s newly elected and controversial president Jair Bolsonaro takes office on 1 January.

This will be the first time a Japanese emperor has abdicated in two centuries.</p> <h2><strong>What summits are there to climb?</strong></h2> <p>The last time France hosted the G7 summit of the world\u2019s most industrialised nations in 2011, migration was a fringe issue, Emmanuel Macron was a little-known investment banker and the riots were happening across the channel in the UK.</p> <p>This time around, President Macron will welcome his peers to Biarritz in August. Priorities are likely to include climate change, the Global Partnership for Education, towards which Macron pledged \u20ac500m (\u00a3452m) of funding, and migration.</p> <p>The G7\u2019s larger cousin, the G20, will meet in Japan in June. Founded after the financial crash of 2008, the summit promotes cooperation and a focus on global financial markets. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/29/g20-summit-argentina-2018-ten-years-later-populism\">The G20 has been criticised</a> for becoming \u201ca stage for an increasing number of authoritarian and populist leaders who are there to perform for their restive followers back home\u201d. According to the Guardian\u2019s economics editor Phillip Inman, this year\u2019s version will be \u201cincreasingly hampered by Donald Trump\u2019s protectionist policies\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8c8894333d549bd075bd43473bda791a9fc01e06\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c8894333d549bd075bd43473bda791a9fc01e06/0_188_3611_2168/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tarana Burke\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tarana Burke, founder of the #MeToo campaign, is one of the speakers at the Women Deliver conference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Sancya/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another year means another COP \u2013 the abbreviation for the annual UN climate summits that warn, with increasing severity, how imperilled we are by our carbon addiction.

If the summit goes ahead, discussion will surely centre on Trump\u2019s continued disavowal of the Paris agreement, and a review of the 2030 UN Sustainable Development goals, four years on from their implementation.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://wd2019.org/\">Women Deliver conference</a>, which is held once every two years on women\u2019s equality and gender rights, will take place in June in Canada, with Justin Trudeau billed to speak \u2013 the first time a sitting leader of a country has done so.</p> <h2><strong>What anniversaries and milestones are coming up?</strong></h2> <p>As 2018 marked the 100th anniversary of the first world war armistice, so 2019 will see the 100th anniversary of the Treaty of Versailles, the formal end of the conflict. It is also the 70th anniversary of the founding of Nato, the collective defence pact originally set up to \u201ckeep the Russians out, the Americans in and the Germans down\u201d.</p> <p>The internet is poised to pass a notable milestone meanwhile, with predictions that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/18/exclusive-dramatic-slowdown-in-global-growth-of-the-internet\">the number of global users will pass the 50% mark</a> in 2019.

It also marks the 250th anniversary of Captain Cook reaching New Zealand, and the 20th anniversary of the creation of the euro.</p> <h2><strong>What\u2019s happening in science?</strong></h2> <p>This year will mark the 50th anniversary of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin\u2019s moon landing. No human has been back since 1972. Perhaps a moment <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/nov/19/space-how-far-have-we-gone-and-where-are-we-going\">to rekindle interest in our cosmological outrider</a>.</p> <p>The year will also see the first private spacecraft from SpaceX and Boeing take crews to the International Space Station. There will also be the first images of a black hole from the Event Horizon telescope, and the first results from the ESA\u2019s Trace Gas Orbiter probe, which is circling Mars to work out if methane plumes are due to life on the planet.</p> <p>Back on Earth, the landmark agreement to redefine the kilogram will come into place in May. Rather than being tied to a lump of metal stored in a Parisian vault, the new definition will be a reflection of Planck\u2019s constant, a number rooted in the quantum world.

Another example is <a href=\"https://ome.health/\">OME Health</a>, which offers health plans built on a person\u2019s gut microbiome, genetics blood markers and other health data.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Will there be a global recession?</strong></h2> <p>Despite 2019 being the Chinese year of the pig \u2013 a symbol that denotes wealth \u2013 in the western world there may be an economic downturn ahead. According to economics editor Phillip Inman: \u201cA recession looms in the UK, Europe and the US. It is possible once the impact of slowing growth in China and rising interest rates are put together, since most of the momentum after the financial crash of 2008 was based on cheap borrowing and the rapid expansion of Chinese trade. Without these two essential elements, the major economies are heading for trouble. Most doomsayer analysts consider 2020 a more likely year for a slump, with the seeds sown in 2019 by poor policy making.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/global-economic-prospects\">The World Bank is predicting</a> a global slowdown in 2019, as the stimulative impact of Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts wane in the US and China is forced to restrict borrowing by state and private businesses.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1570b67ef50fd7e94f6503199fb1234fc5fe873c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1570b67ef50fd7e94f6503199fb1234fc5fe873c/0_0_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The effects of Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts are receding in the US.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Central banks are also poised to tighten monetary policies. \u201cThe US Federal Reserve is due to increase interest rates at least twice in 2019,\u201d Inman says. \u201cIt is also expected to further unwind its quantitative easing policy. An increase in the cost of borrowing is already hitting the US housing market which is reaching levels of distress last seen in the run up to the 2008 financial crash.\u201d</p> <p>The World Trade Organisation could be unableto judge trade disputes between countries in 2019. When he took office, Donald Trump blocked the appointment of judges to the WTO to replace retirees, leaving a large number of vacancies. The WTO needs a minimum number of legal experts to judge cases and could be inquorate <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/09/20/650052772/experts-say-trumps-hostility-to-the-wto-could-cripple-it?t=1543581394966\">as early as spring 2019</a>.</p> <h2><strong>What should I buy in 2019?</strong></h2> <p>There will be no shortage of new technological releases in 2019. Samsung is due to launch follow-ups to its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/22/samsung-galaxy-note-9-review-phone-bluetooth-s-pen\">critically acclaimed Galaxy S and Note</a> series, while Apple will be announcing a new iPhone in September, and Google the Pixel 4 phone in October.</p> <p>Amazon will be announcing new products in September, likely to be iterations of its home management Echo devices, and Apple will unveil new Macs and tablets in October. In terms of tech developments, the Guardian\u2019s assistant technology editor Samuel Gibbs predicts that the biggest advance will come in the form of flexible screens in 2019.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5e2074596b997544a1cb77ab6c2b399de991ac97\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e2074596b997544a1cb77ab6c2b399de991ac97/0_19_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Google Home Hub\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Voice-enabled products such as the Google Home Hub are likely to transform shopping.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Drew/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Futurologist John Vary adds that the voice search enabled by products such as Google Home and Amazon\u2019s Alexa will develop to \u201cenable people to find items however they describe them and in any language\u201d. While augmented reality could enhance personalised shopping to mean \u201csmart home tech could act as your own shopper, alerting retailers in advance when you\u2019re looking for a product,\u201d he says.</p> <h2><strong>What can I (binge) watch?</strong></h2> <p>With Channel 4 moving to new headquarters in Leeds in 2019, the Guardian\u2019s TV editor, Lanre Bakare, picks the fourth season of comedy Catastrophe and Brexit: The Uncivil War, as ones to watch on the channel next year. Catastrophe tells the story of a couple raising a child conceived in a one night stand. The two-hour Brexit drama meanwhile stars Benedict Cumberbatch as Leave campaigner Dominic Cummings, and is based on first-hand accounts of the campaigns leading up to Britain\u2019s referendum on leaving the EU in 2016.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cf1fa9bb930d1f07f5726aea6f9bfdffdd382edb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf1fa9bb930d1f07f5726aea6f9bfdffdd382edb/0_15_2833_1700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney in Channel 4\u2019s Catastrophe\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney are poised to return in Channel 4\u2019s Catastrophe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Johnson/Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Further recommendations include big-budget sequels \u2013 the final season of fantasy thriller Game of Thrones, airing on Sky Atlantic in April. There\u2019s also the third season of the brooding American noir True Detective in January. Moonlight Oscar winner Mahershala Ali takes the lead from season two\u2019s Colin Farrell and Rachel McAdams. Finally, everyone\u2019s favourite local Norwich radio presenter returns to the BBC with a satirical take on a live talk show in February on This Time \u2026 With Alan Partridge.</p> <p>On the big screen there is a volley of new releases to look out for. With 2018 being a record-breaking year for box office takings, major studios will be hoping to replicate their success with a slate of blockbusters: a live-action Lion King in July, Captain Marvel in May \u2013 the franchise\u2019s first female-led film \u2013 Toy Story 4 in June, Terminator 6 and Frozen 2 in November, and the final instalment of the Star Wars sequel trilogy, Star Wars IX, in December.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cf3ed875a5f960a48dff403a4f71acf1750d4edd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf3ed875a5f960a48dff403a4f71acf1750d4edd/0_83_5196_3118/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mahershala Ali in True Detective series three.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mahershala Ali in True Detective series three.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Warrick Page/HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Guardian\u2019s film editor Catherine Shoard\u2019s picks include King\u2019s Speech director Tom Hooper\u2019s adaptation of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical Cats, starring Idris Elba, Taylor Swift, Judi Dench and Ian McKellen.

Keza picks out Harry Potter Go, made by the creators of Pok\u00e9mon Go, as \u201canother potential world-conquering mobile game\u201d, she says, this time based on the Harry Potter universe. There is also Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice \u2013 a horror samurai game from the director of Dark Souls, \u201cone of the best games of the decade\u201d, according to MacDonald; and The Last of Us Part 2, an \u201cintense, cinematic game about a survivor of a world-decimating outbreak \u2013 far from the usual boring zombie story\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4fae953074a9bf79b0fa2ff13c19b3cf32d99767\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4fae953074a9bf79b0fa2ff13c19b3cf32d99767/0_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Activision/FromSoftware</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Further reading</strong></h2> <p><strong>Adele by Leila Slimani (February)<br></strong>One of the runaway bestsellers of 2016 was Slimani\u2019s Lullaby, a chilling tale of a homicidal immigrant nanny, and Slimani hopes to continue this success with a new novel telling the story of a sex-addicted Parisian journalist.</p> <p><strong>Black Leopard, Red Wolf by Marlon James (February)<br></strong>Marlon James releases the follow-up to his Man Booker Prize-winning 2015 novel, A Brief History of Seven Killings.

Sitting president Muhammadu Buhari faces a record 78 opposition candidates, some of whom accuse him of failing to deal adequately with corruption. Following an illness earlier this year and five months spent recuperating in London, there have also been bizarre suggestions that he has been replaced by a body double. That would certainly make campaigning in the world\u2019s seventh most populous country easier. Other major democracies going to the polls include India, where Narendra Modi is seeking a second term, and Indonesia, where the one-term incumbent faces a challenge from yet another rightwing populist candidate. Speaking of rightwing populists, Brazil\u2019s newly elected and controversial president Jair Bolsonaro takes office on 1 January. Other notable votes take place in Thailand (February), South Africa (May), Argentina (October) and Canada (October). And finally, in Japan, Emperor Akihito will abdicate in April owing to health concerns after heart surgery and treatment for prostate cancer. This will be the first time a Japanese emperor has abdicated in two centuries. What summits are there to climb? The last time France hosted the G7 summit of the world\u2019s most industrialised nations in 2011, migration was a fringe issue, Emmanuel Macron was a little-known investment banker and the riots were happening across the channel in the UK. This time around, President Macron will welcome his peers to Biarritz in August. Priorities are likely to include climate change, the Global Partnership for Education, towards which Macron pledged \u20ac500m (\u00a3452m) of funding, and migration. The G7\u2019s larger cousin, the G20, will meet in Japan in June. Founded after the financial crash of 2008, the summit promotes cooperation and a focus on global financial markets. The G20 has been criticised for becoming \u201ca stage for an increasing number of authoritarian and populist leaders who are there to perform for their restive followers back home\u201d. According to the Guardian\u2019s economics editor Phillip Inman, this year\u2019s version will be \u201cincreasingly hampered by Donald Trump\u2019s protectionist policies\u201d. Another year means another COP \u2013 the abbreviation for the annual UN climate summits that warn, with increasing severity, how imperilled we are by our carbon addiction. Alas, this year\u2019s host, Brazil, has pulled out owing to \u201cbudget restrictions\u201d. If the summit goes ahead, discussion will surely centre on Trump\u2019s continued disavowal of the Paris agreement, and a review of the 2030 UN Sustainable Development goals, four years on from their implementation. The Women Deliver conference, which is held once every two years on women\u2019s equality and gender rights, will take place in June in Canada, with Justin Trudeau billed to speak \u2013 the first time a sitting leader of a country has done so. What anniversaries and milestones are coming up? As 2018 marked the 100th anniversary of the first world war armistice, so 2019 will see the 100th anniversary of the Treaty of Versailles, the formal end of the conflict. It is also the 70th anniversary of the founding of Nato, the collective defence pact originally set up to \u201ckeep the Russians out, the Americans in and the Germans down\u201d. The internet is poised to pass a notable milestone meanwhile, with predictions that the number of global users will pass the 50% mark in 2019. In the US, for the first time ever the population will have more people older than age 60 than younger than age 18. In births and deaths, 2019 is the 500th anniversary of the death of original renaissance man Leonardo Da Vinci and the 200th anniversary of the birth of Queen Victoria. It also marks the 250th anniversary of Captain Cook reaching New Zealand, and the 20th anniversary of the creation of the euro. What\u2019s happening in science? This year will mark the 50th anniversary of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin\u2019s moon landing. No human has been back since 1972. Perhaps a moment to rekindle interest in our cosmological outrider. The year will also see the first private spacecraft from SpaceX and Boeing take crews to the International Space Station. There will also be the first images of a black hole from the Event Horizon telescope, and the first results from the ESA\u2019s Trace Gas Orbiter probe, which is circling Mars to work out if methane plumes are due to life on the planet. Back on Earth, the landmark agreement to redefine the kilogram will come into place in May. Rather than being tied to a lump of metal stored in a Parisian vault, the new definition will be a reflection of Planck\u2019s constant, a number rooted in the quantum world. The weight is over. 2019 could see the first birth in the UK of a baby with DNA from three parents. The process of mitochondrial transfer was legalised in Britain in 2015 and Professor Alison Murdoch has since been pioneering the technique in Newcastle, with the first woman selected to take part in the process this year. John Vary, a futurologist at John Lewis\u2019s Innovation Labs, notes some broader, science fiction-style developments which may also intrigue us in 2019. \u201cIn 2019, we could reach a point where customers can share their DNA with shops so that retailers can tailor products to a customer\u2019s genetics or ancestry,\u201d he predicts. \u201cWaitrose &amp; Partners is piloting DnaNudge, an app which will use shoppers\u2019 DNA to help them make healthier choices while food shopping. Another example is OME Health, which offers health plans built on a person\u2019s gut microbiome, genetics blood markers and other health data.\u201d Will there be a global recession? Despite 2019 being the Chinese year of the pig \u2013 a symbol that denotes wealth \u2013 in the western world there may be an economic downturn ahead. According to economics editor Phillip Inman: \u201cA recession looms in the UK, Europe and the US. It is possible once the impact of slowing growth in China and rising interest rates are put together, since most of the momentum after the financial crash of 2008 was based on cheap borrowing and the rapid expansion of Chinese trade. Without these two essential elements, the major economies are heading for trouble. Most doomsayer analysts consider 2020 a more likely year for a slump, with the seeds sown in 2019 by poor policy making.\u201d The World Bank is predicting a global slowdown in 2019, as the stimulative impact of Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts wane in the US and China is forced to restrict borrowing by state and private businesses. Central banks are also poised to tighten monetary policies. \u201cThe US Federal Reserve is due to increase interest rates at least twice in 2019,\u201d Inman says. \u201cIt is also expected to further unwind its quantitative easing policy. An increase in the cost of borrowing is already hitting the US housing market which is reaching levels of distress last seen in the run up to the 2008 financial crash.\u201d The World Trade Organisation could be unableto judge trade disputes between countries in 2019. When he took office, Donald Trump blocked the appointment of judges to the WTO to replace retirees, leaving a large number of vacancies. The WTO needs a minimum number of legal experts to judge cases and could be inquorate as early as spring 2019. What should I buy in 2019? There will be no shortage of new technological releases in 2019. Samsung is due to launch follow-ups to its critically acclaimed Galaxy S and Note series, while Apple will be announcing a new iPhone in September, and Google the Pixel 4 phone in October. Amazon will be announcing new products in September, likely to be iterations of its home management Echo devices, and Apple will unveil new Macs and tablets in October. In terms of tech developments, the Guardian\u2019s assistant technology editor Samuel Gibbs predicts that the biggest advance will come in the form of flexible screens in 2019. Futurologist John Vary adds that the voice search enabled by products such as Google Home and Amazon\u2019s Alexa will develop to \u201cenable people to find items however they describe them and in any language\u201d. While augmented reality could enhance personalised shopping to mean \u201csmart home tech could act as your own shopper, alerting retailers in advance when you\u2019re looking for a product,\u201d he says. What can I (binge) watch? With Channel 4 moving to new headquarters in Leeds in 2019, the Guardian\u2019s TV editor, Lanre Bakare, picks the fourth season of comedy Catastrophe and Brexit: The Uncivil War, as ones to watch on the channel next year. Catastrophe tells the story of a couple raising a child conceived in a one night stand. The two-hour Brexit drama meanwhile stars Benedict Cumberbatch as Leave campaigner Dominic Cummings, and is based on first-hand accounts of the campaigns leading up to Britain\u2019s referendum on leaving the EU in 2016. Further recommendations include big-budget sequels \u2013 the final season of fantasy thriller Game of Thrones, airing on Sky Atlantic in April. There\u2019s also the third season of the brooding American noir True Detective in January. Moonlight Oscar winner Mahershala Ali takes the lead from season two\u2019s Colin Farrell and Rachel McAdams. Finally, everyone\u2019s favourite local Norwich radio presenter returns to the BBC with a satirical take on a live talk show in February on This Time \u2026 With Alan Partridge. On the big screen there is a volley of new releases to look out for. With 2018 being a record-breaking year for box office takings, major studios will be hoping to replicate their success with a slate of blockbusters: a live-action Lion King in July, Captain Marvel in May \u2013 the franchise\u2019s first female-led film \u2013 Toy Story 4 in June, Terminator 6 and Frozen 2 in November, and the final instalment of the Star Wars sequel trilogy, Star Wars IX, in December. The Guardian\u2019s film editor Catherine Shoard\u2019s picks include King\u2019s Speech director Tom Hooper\u2019s adaptation of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical Cats, starring Idris Elba, Taylor Swift, Judi Dench and Ian McKellen. There is also the Downton Abbey movie; Martin Scorsese\u2019s The Irishman, starring Godfathers Al Pacino and Robert De Niro; Get Out director Jordan Peele\u2019s latest horror, Us; an adaptation of Donna Tartt\u2019s novel The Goldfinch starring Nicole Kidman; and Greta Gerwig\u2019s adaptation of Little Women, starring 2018\u2019s newcomer Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet. Valued at more than $93bn, the games industry almost doubles the revenue of the international film industry, and the Guardian\u2019s games editor Keza MacDonald has some selections for 2019. Keza picks out Harry Potter Go, made by the creators of Pok\u00e9mon Go, as \u201canother potential world-conquering mobile game\u201d, she says, this time based on the Harry Potter universe. There is also Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice \u2013 a horror samurai game from the director of Dark Souls, \u201cone of the best games of the decade\u201d, according to MacDonald; and The Last of Us Part 2, an \u201cintense, cinematic game about a survivor of a world-decimating outbreak \u2013 far from the usual boring zombie story\u201d. Further reading Adele by Leila Slimani (February) One of the runaway bestsellers of 2016 was Slimani\u2019s Lullaby, a chilling tale of a homicidal immigrant nanny, and Slimani hopes to continue this success with a new novel telling the story of a sex-addicted Parisian journalist. Black Leopard, Red Wolf by Marlon James (February) Marlon James releases the follow-up to his Man Booker Prize-winning 2015 novel, A Brief History of Seven Killings. With Black Leopard, James creates an imaginary ancient world built on African mythology to tell the story of a hunter tracking a lost child. It is the first in a new trilogy, Dark Star. The Liar by Ayelet Gundar-Goshen (March) Israeli author Gundar-Goshen pens her third novel on a teenage girl who accuses an older minor celebrity of sexual assault. A fictionalised tale building on the #MeToo movement of 2017-18. The Other Americans by Laila Lalami (March) Pulitzer prize finalist Lalami writes a novel charting the American immigrant experience through the eyes of a Moroccan family living in California. It is already earning praise from the likes of JM Coetzee. Clear Bright Future by Paul Mason (April) Journalist Paul Mason follows up on 2016\u2019s Postcapitalism, which formulated a collapse of capitalism as we know it, with a theorisation of what makes us human and how we are still capable of changing the future. The Heartland by Nathan Filer (April) Former mental health nurse Nathan Filer publishes his second book, a collection of first-person encounters and essays on the diagnosis and treatment of schizophrenia.",

Like their French counterparts, the protesters have organized on Facebook pages, and focused their fury on a federal carbon tax, but their grievances also include stalled pipeline projects, oil sector layoffs, and \u2013 for a small minority \u2013 the government\u2019s liberal asylum policies.

Some companies have begun to lay workers off, prompting fears of potentially widespread job losses in the oil-rich province of Alberta, where at least 40,000 jobs were lost during the last oil market crash of 2014.

But for workers in the resource-rich province, the moves are too little, too late. Sunday\u2019s protest was motivated by anger over federal energy policies \u2013 including the stalled Trans Mountain pipeline and the implementation of a federal carbon tax as part of government\u2019s climate change strategy. \u201cA lot of people are frustrated about what\u2019s going on in their country,\u201d said Miller. Some at the rally wore yellow vests: standard safety clothing for workers in the province\u2019s tar sands fields \u2013 but also the symbol of the French protests which began as a revolt over an environmental fuel tax and morphed into an anti-establishment movement against low incomes and tax inequality. Canadian protesters have also called for an end to their country\u2019s carbon tax, but the country\u2019s nascent Yellow Vest groups \u2013 a minority in the broader protests \u2013 have also embraced rightwing populist causes. One Facebook group for protesters, Yellow Vests Canada, has amassed nearly 90,000 members since it was created two weeks ago. A description on its main page reads: \u201cThis group is to protest the CARBON TAX and the Treason of our country\u2019s politicians who have the audacity to sell out OUR country\u2019s sovereignty over to the Globalist UN and their Tyrannical policies.\u201d One of the group\u2019s administrators, Josue St-Cyr, said most of its members are in western Canada. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to make ourselves heard because obviously nobody\u2019s listening to us,\u201d said St-Cyr, a heavy-equipment operator in the oil sands fields. Discussions on the group often target Canada\u2019s approval this month of a new UN pact designed to promote cooperation to ensure safe migration between states.

          "bodyText": "A third Canadian citizen has been detained in China, according to Canada\u2019s foreign ministry, an arrest that threatens to escalate a protracted diplomatic feud between the two countries. Two other Canadians were detained in China after the arrest of the senior Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou in Canada this month. \u201cGlobal Affairs Canada is aware of a Canadian citizen detained in China,\u201d said a spokesperson for the ministry, which manages Canada\u2019s diplomatic and consular relations. \u201cConsular officials are providing assistance to the family.\u201d Citing privacy legislation, the spokesperson did not give any further details about the arrest. Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said on Wednesday that the latest incident was \u201ca very separate case\u201d from those of the former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor, who were detained during the diplomatic quarrel triggered by Meng\u2019s arrest. \u201cThere are tens of thousands of Canadians that live, travel and work in China,\u201d Trudeau said. He added that the new case \u201cdoesn\u2019t seem to fit the pattern of facts on the previous two. \u201cEscalation and political posturing might be satisfactory in the short term to make yourself seem like you are stomping on the table and doing something significant, but it may not contribute to the outcome we all want.\u201d China\u2019s ministry of foreign affairs said on Wednesday it was not aware of the report. \u201cI have not heard anything about the situation you have asked about,\u201d said Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for the ministry. Canada\u2019s ambassador to China, John McCallum, met Spavor on Monday, and had previously visited Kovrig. Beijing has threatened Canada with \u201cgrave consequences\u201d if Meng is not freed. Meng faces extradition to the US on charges linked to fraud and violations of US sanctions on Iran. On Tuesday Canada\u2019s embassy in China published a commemoration of Charter 08, a petition calling for democratic reform co-authored by the Nobel laureate Liu Xiaobo, on the social media site Weibo. Liu, a veteran Chinese dissident, died last year while serving an 11-year prison sentence. By Wednesday the post had been partially censored. The embassy wrote on Twitter: \u201cWe commemorated 10th anniversary of Nobel-laureate Liu Xiaobo\u2019s Charter 08 on social media yesterday. 1300+ people shared views before comment section was shut down. Violation of article 35 (freedom of speech) of China\u2019s own constitution?\u201d",

The bitterly contested talks, some fought out in public, and US tariffs on Canadian aluminum and steel were widely perceived as a blow to the once-strong relationship. Canada now finds itself in uncharted territory: relations with its biggest trading party have soured since Donald Trump took office (Herman described its perception of the US as \u201chostile\u201d) and Meng\u2019s arrest has now angered its second largest trading partner. The result is potentially costly feuds with two of the world\u2019s largest markets. \u201cThe problem is that as a medium-size economy, Canada has somewhat limited leverage is that it can use in trying to diversify, particularly trying to diversify from the United States,\u201d said Herman.

          "bodyText": "A senior Chinese telecoms executive committed fraud when she lied about links between Huawei and a shell company used to sell telecommunications equipment to Iran in breach of US sanctions, Canadian prosecutors have told a Vancouver court. Meng Wanzhou, Huawei\u2019s chief financial officer, appeared in court on Friday as she sought bail in a case that has sparked a major international dispute between China and the US. After more than five hours of debate, the court has not yet decided if Meng will be granted bail as she fights an extradition order to the US. The closely-watched hearing will resume on Monday morning. Crown prosecutors allege Meng \u2013 the daughter of Huawei\u2019s founder \u2013 engaged in \u201cconspiracy to defraud multiple financial institutions\u201d in 2013 when she attempted to convince bankers that Huawei and a former Hong Kong subsidiary SkyCom were wholly separate entities. \u201cMs Meng personally represented to those banks that Skycom and Huawei were separate, when in fact they were not separate,\u201d said Crown attorney John Gibb-Carlsey. \u201cSkycom was Huawei.\u201d SkyCom employees used Huawei email addresses and bank records linked the two companies together, and SkyCom was used to engage in business deals with sanctioned countries, including with Iranian telecom companies, the court heard.

They also argued that Iranian sanctions were complex and SkyCom\u2019s civilian telecommunications equipment sales likely weren\u2019t in violation of any rules. Meng\u2019s surprise arrest on Saturday as she travelled to Mexico is the latest salvo in a feud over trade and technology that has pitted the US against China, with Canada caught in the middle. Since Saturday, the telecom executive has been detained at the Alouette Correctional Centre for Women, a facility 50km outside Vancouver\u2019s downtown core. The case, which has prompted fury in China, has put Canada in a difficult position: comply with a request from its neighbour and largest trading partner, or risk angering the country it has, for months, sought stronger ties with. Canadian wariness is not without cause: the last high-profile extradition request executed by Canada resulted in tit-for-tat action by the Chinese. In 2014, British Columbia resident Su Bin was arrested by Canadian officials, on accusations that he had stolen top-secret American fighter jet plans. He later pleaded guilty to the charges in a California court. Shortly after his arrest, two Canadians, Kevin and Julia Garret, who ran a coffee shop in Dandong, were arrested by Chinese officials. Kevin Garrett was charged with espionage and spent two years in prison. \u201cChina plays rough.

The Canadian Extradition Act requires that in order for a person to be extradited, the individual must be facing charges for an offence deemed criminal in both Canada and the country seeking the extradition request. Crown prosecutors argue Meng violated section 380 of Canada\u2019s criminal code, which pertains to fraud. As China pressures Canada to release her, the detention has also created domestic political fissures with opposition parties expressing frustration over a lack of information from the federal government. In an interview with Fox News, the former prime minister Stephen Harper said Justin Trudeau should ban Huawei from Canada. \u201cThese are organizations, ultimately tightly tied to the Chinese security apparatus, and we think there are some real, serious issues there,\u201d said Harper. \u201cThe United States is encouraging western allies to essentially push Huawei out of the emerging 5G network, and my personal view is that is something western countries should be doing in terms of our own long-term security issues.\u201d",

On Thursday, Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said he was made aware of the pending arrest, but says he did not interfere in the process and has not yet spoken with his Chinese counterpart. \u201cThe appropriate authorities took the decisions in this case,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cWe were advised by them with a few days\u2019 notice that this was in the works but of course there was no engagement or involvement in the political level in this decision because we respect the independence of our judicial processes.\u201d But early evidence of political damage was readily apparent: the Chinese ambassador, Lu Shaye, quickly withdrew from a planned appearance before Canada\u2019s foreign affairs committee in Ottawa. China\u2019s embassy strongly condemned Meng\u2019s detention, issuing a statement that it would \u201ctake all measures to resolutely protect the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese citizens\u201d. The high-profile arrest has prompted fears that Canada could face costly economic and political retribution from China. \u201cPresident Xi refers to these companies as national champions. These are flag-carrying companies who are absolutely the face of China that Xi wants to be showing,\u201d said Stephanie Carvin, a professor of international relations at Carlton University. \u201cAnd if China is mad at Canada \u2013 and it sure looks like it is \u2013 there is the risk of retaliation.\u201d In recent years, China has quickly become one of Canada\u2019s largest trading partners, a relationship that has becoming increasingly important as Canada navigates a mercurial relationship with the US. But the recent spat is likely to put the brakes on a free trade agreement between the two countries. \u201cWhen there is a crisis in the relationship \u2013 and there is now \u2013 China simply goes silent, high-level visits are put off, exchanges don\u2019t happen,\u201d said David Mulroney, Canada\u2019s former ambassador to China. \u201cI think we\u2019re going into a deep freeze for as many months as it takes to resolve itself.\u201d Last year, total exports to China \u2013 minerals, wood products and canola \u2013 were valued at more than $18bn, and Beijing has previously been willing to use its economic power against Canada. In one recent instance, it cited the blackleg fungus, which affects canola crops, as a justification for cancelling billions of dollars in canola exports. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we see suddenly another \u2018blackleg scare\u2019 with Canadian canola or a ban on Nova Scotia lobster,\u201d said Carvin, adding that Canadian companies with a large presence in China \u2013 such as the train manufacturer Bombardier \u2013 are also at risk of punitive measures. Other analysts were less alarmed: \u201cThe Chinese are not hot-headed,\u201d said Gordon Houlden, head of the China Institute at the University of Alberta. \u201cThe government \u2026 tends to be cautious. I think we\u2019ll enter a \u2018wait-and-see\u2019 period.\u201d Meng\u2019s arrest comes amid a growing wariness in Canada over Huawei\u2019s increasingly outsized influence and presence in the country. In a rare public speech earlier in the week, Canada\u2019s top intelligence official said that state-sponsored espionage \u2013 including through 5G cellular technology \u2013 is a critical threat to Canada\u2019s national security. Huawei has positioned itself as the global leader of 5G, but governments in the US, New Zealand and Australia have already moved to block the use of the company\u2019s equipment. American lawmakers recently warned their Canadian counterparts that the use of Huawei-developed infrastructure greatly increased the risk of surveillance and hacking. Nonetheless, the Chinese telecom giant has continued to pour millions of dollars into cutting-edge research at Canadian universities \u2013 and has become the target of critics who say it keeps much of the new technology for itself, at the expense of Canadian labour and expertise. Over the last decade, Huawei has committed nearly $50m to 13 universities across the country, with more investment pledged in the coming years. Canadian professors have transferred the full rights to their inventions to Huawei at least 40 times, with the relationship between the universities and the telecom company producing hundreds of patents, many of which relate to next-generation 5G technology, according to an investigation by the Globe and Mail. \u201cWe have a really, really important relationship with a country that\u2019s totally unlike us. It offers us opportunities \u2013 but also in many ways poses a threat to Canadian interests and Canadian objectives,\u201d said Mulroney. \u201cSo we have to be really thoughtful in terms of how we move forward.\u201d Reuters contributed to this report",

          "bodyText": "The US national security adviser, John Bolton, has said he knew in advance that a top Chinese telecoms executive would be arrested in Canada to face extradition to the US, in what is escalating into a major diplomatic incident. Beijing is calling for the release of Meng Wanzhou, the global chief financial officer of the vast Huawei corporation, and demanded Ottawa and Washington provide reasons for her arrest in Vancouver on Saturday. Bolton would not give a specific reason for the US request, saying it was a law enforcement matter, but in a radio interview on Thursday he said the US had long been concerned about the role of Huawei and other Chinese tech companies in the theft of US technological knowhow. \u201cWe\u2019ve had enormous concern for years about \u2026 the practice of Chinese firms to use stolen American intellectual property to engage in forced technology transfers and to be used really as arms of the Chinese government\u2019s objectives in terms of information technology in particular,\u201d Bolton told National Public Radio. \u201cSo not respecting this particular arrest, but Huawei is one company we\u2019ve been concerned about, there are others as well,\u201d he said, adding that the issue would be the subject of negotiations between the US and China over the next 90 days, the deadline laid down by Donald Trump at last week\u2019s G20 summit in Argentina for both countries to resolve trade disputes, before he ordered a significant ratcheting up of trade sanctions. \u201cAs the negotiations proceed I think we\u2019re going to see a lot about what Chinese companies have done to steal intellectual property, to hack into the computer systems, not just of the US government, although they\u2019ve done that, but into private companies as well,\u201d the national security adviser said. Reuters, however, cited people familiar with the investigation as saying the arrest was connected to an alleged scheme to use the global banking system to evade US sanctions against Iran. The news agency reported that Huawei had been under scrutiny for sanctions-busting since 2016 and that more recently, the investigation has included the company\u2019s use of HSBC Holdings plc to make illegal transactions involving Iran. However, the sources for the report said that HSBC is not under investigation. Republican senator Marco Rubio said on Twitter on Thursday night that, if found guilty of violating US sanctions, Huawei should be barred from operating in the US and purchasing US technology. Bolton said he was not sure if Trump knew of the arrest in Canada when the president sat down to a steak dinner with China\u2019s Xi Jinping in Buenos Aires to discuss ways to avert a trade war between the two countries. \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t know the answer to that,\u201d Bolton said. \u201cI knew in advance, but this is something that\u2019s, that we get from the justice department and these kinds of things happen with some frequency. We certainly don\u2019t inform the president on every one of them.\u201d The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said on Thursday he was also made aware of the arrest before it took place. \u201cThe appropriate authorities took the decisions in this case,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cWe were advised by them with a few days\u2019 notice that this was in the works but of course there was no engagement or involvement in the political level in this decision because we respect the independence of our judicial processes.\u201d Canada confirmed Meng\u2019s detention on Wednesday night. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said on Thursday that Beijing had separately called on the US and Canada to \u201cclarify the reasons for the detention\u201d immediately and \u201cimmediately release the detained person\u201d. The spokesman said China had been providing consular assistance to Meng since learning of her arrest. Meng is one of the vice-chairs on the Chinese technology company\u2019s board and is the daughter of the company\u2019s founder, Ren Zhengfei. A court hearing has been set for Friday, according to Canada\u2019s department of justice, which confirmed in a statement that Meng had been arrested and was facing extradition. \u201cAs there is a publication ban in effect, we cannot provide any further detail at this time,\u201d it said. \u201cThe ban was sought by Ms Meng.\u201d US stock futures and Asian shares tumbled after Meng\u2019s arrest. The news came as Washington and Beijing begin three months of negotiations aimed at de-escalating their trade war, which is adding to global investors\u2019 worries over rising US interest rates and other risks to global economic growth. Fearing that a US-China trade war truce is becoming unattainable, Europe\u2019s main stock indices slumped to their lowest point since December 2016 in morning trading on Thursday. The FTSE 100 fell by 2.5% while benchmark indices in France, Germany and Italy all lost more than 2%. Norihiro Fujito, the chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities in Tokyo, said: \u201cThe US has been telling its allies not to use Huawei products for security reasons and is likely to continue to put pressure on its allies. \u201cSo while there was a brief moment of optimism after the weekend US-China talks \u2026 the reality is, it won\u2019t be that easy.\u201d",

The world\u2019s best known carbon tax to carry that name began in the European Union in 2005, with the Emissions Trading System. With initial success the price of pollution permits reached more than \u20ac20 ($22/\u00a318) for the right to emit a ton of carbon. But heavy lobbying by industry led to a massive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jun/19/emissions-trading-manufacturing-industry\">oversupply of permits</a> and a price crash to \u20ac3 in 2013 \u2013 far too low to drive carbon cuts. Reforms have taken the <a href=\"https://sandbag.org.uk/carbon-price-viewer/\">price back above \u20ac20 in recent weeks</a>.</p> \n<p>China has seen the attraction of carbon markets as an efficient way of delivering the biggest carbon cuts at the lowest cost. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/19/china-aims-to-drastically-cut-greenhouse-gas-emissions-through-trading-scheme\">Its carbon market is being established</a> and will, on completion, be the world\u2019s biggest.</p> \n<p>In the world\u2019s second biggest polluter, the US, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Greenhouse_Gas_Initiative\">10 east coast states</a> have had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jan/31/carbon-tax-cap-and-trade\">a \u201ccap and trade\u201d system</a> for carbon emissions since 2009, under which companies have their greenhouse gas emissions capped and then must trade any surplus or deficit with others. But Barack Obama, while president, was unable to pass a nationwide system. Some prominent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/jul/02/republicans-try-to-save-their-deteriorating-party-with-another-push-for-a-carbon-tax\">Republicans have backed a revenue-neutral carbon tax</a>, but with little success.</p> \n<p>Many fossil fuel companies claim to back carbon taxes, notably in Australia, where climate policy rows have toppled prime ministers. The oil giant BP is among the supporters of carbon taxes, yet recently <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/11/01/bp-washington-state-carbon-tax-initiative/\">spent $13m (\u00a310.22m) in helping to defeat</a> a proposal in Washington state.</p> \n<p>In the rest of Canada, despite the success story in British Columbia, other provinces are dragging their heels.

In British Columbia, it has definitely worked.\u201d</p> \n<p>Nonetheless, the outlook for carbon taxes looks bright: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/22/carbon-markets-back-from-the-brink-of-collapse-says-world-bank\">88 nations</a>, representing more than half of global emissions, say they are or will uses carbon pricing to tackle climate change. Furthermore, some states have suggested they would impose carbon border levies on imported goods from nations that do not tax carbon.</p> \n<p>By design, the British Columbia plan was simple: it slapped a tax on any fossil fuels used for heating, electricity and transportation. Each person and business was expected to shoulder the burden of pricing pollution; no loopholes, no exemptions.</p> \n<p>In everyday life prices ticked up, most noticeably at the gas pump. Companies with emissions-intensive work passed their increased costs on to consumers.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The tax was leading edge at the time. And, unfortunately, 11 years later, it\u2019s still leading edge</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Gordon Campbell, former premier of British Columbia</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>But the critical selling point of the plan \u2013 the tax\u2019s revenue neutral design \u2013 was unprecedented. With a revenue-neutral tax, the government keeps none of the money collected from the levy. Instead, it redistributes all of it \u2013 close to $1.8bn in its first three years \u2013 back to taxpayers in the form of tax cuts.</p> \n<p>As a result, the increase in energy costs for residents was offset by a tax cut of roughly equal value. Anyone willing and able to change their behaviour to reduce emissions would end up in the black.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe nice thing about the revenue-neutral carbon tax was that it didn\u2019t judge people: if you want to buy something that emits more than somebody else, you\u2019re going to pay more tax,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cPeople who wanted to have their taxes actually reduced had to change a little bit of their behaviour, and their tax load would have been reduced.\u201d</p> \n<p>Low-income residents, as well as those living in rural areas that relied more heavily on fossil fuels, received extra tax and cash benefits.</p> \n<p>The tax began as a $10/ton levy on carbon emissions, eventually reaching $30/ton by 2012. In speeches touting the tax, Campbell said the reduction in emissions would equate to removing 750,000 cars from the road in the province.</p> \n<p>The move \u2013 the first of its kind \u2013 placated both conservative economists and environmentalists. And, it worked.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"00ec4e4a31472e36b8504b666d3331187b708079\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/00ec4e4a31472e36b8504b666d3331187b708079/1043_259_847_1058/801.jpg\" alt=\"Gordon Campbell.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gordon Campbell helped to usher in the revenue-neutral carbon tax while he was premier of British Columbia.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vibrant Pictures/Alamy Stock Photo</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cWe saw fossil fuel consumption decrease by more than 17% and in the rest of Canada fuel consumption increased by more than 1%,\u201d Wu said of the four-year period between 2008 and 2012, when the first tranche of increases went into effect.</p> \n<p>Fears that the tax would have a negative impact on the economy quickly melted away when the numbers came in, she said. The province grew its economy by 16%, far outpacing any other region of the country.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt was leading edge at the time,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cAnd, unfortunately, 11 years later, it\u2019s still leading edge.\u201d</p> \n<p>By 2012, when the tax reached its first maximum level ($30 per ton), 64% of the population supported it. By 2016, it garnered the support of nearly 70% of residents.</p> \n<p>In Victoria, the province\u2019s capital, residents remain unfazed over the constant increases \u2013 a testament of how the tax has drifted into the background. Devon Crosby, who has worked in the oil and gas industry for much of his career, said he has little patience for the current feud across the country. \u201cLook, I\u2019d rather pay an extra 15% on gas for a cleaner and nicer British Columbia.\u201d</p> \n<p>For others, the tax cuts outweigh any increased costs. \u201cMoney talks,\u201d said resident Kim Hollingsworth. \u201cPeople need incentives to change their behaviour.\u201d She based her decision to buy a new, more energy efficient heater on the climate rebates \u2013 part of the suite of climate policies Campbell introduced.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/03/we-are-last-generation-that-can-stop-climate-change-un-summit\">'We are last generation that can stop climate change' \u2013 UN summit</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The revenue-neutral aspect of the tax is novel but has frustrated some environmental groups, who feel the tax does not do enough to reduce emissions.

          "bodyText": "Two decades ago, Canada\u2019s westernmost province was in the midst of environmental and economic calamity. A small beetle was devouring large swathes of the region\u2019s valuable pine forests, leaving millions of trees dead as infestation spread. The government waited anxiously for cold winters \u2013 which would kill the beetles \u2013 but year after year the cold never came. By 2008 the decimation of the forests, along with a series of intense storms walloping the province, prompted British Columbia to take action on climate change. The provincial government introduced a carbon tax, putting a price on fossil fuel emissions. And, crucially, all the money raised was returned to the people in tax cuts. \u201cIt was groundbreaking,\u201d said Karen Tam Wu of the Pembina Institute, an environmental thinktank. \u201cIt was the first one in the world that was revenue neutral.\u201d A decade later, as climate scientists and policymakers converge on UN talks in Katowice, Poland, urgently seek mechanisms to rein in carbon emissions in a bid to halt the inexorable rise of global temperatures, the British Columbia experiment with the tax is setting an example to others. Economists and environmentalists have voiced support for it; the World Bank has called it a \u201ctextbook\u201d way of developing environmental policy. Earlier in October, the economist William Nordhaus, winner of this year\u2019s Nobel Prize for economics, threw his support behind the British Columbia model as an ideal model for export to other economies. British Columbia is a province known for its environmental lean: yoga and hiking are the region\u2019s main cultural exports. For many Canadians, it seems fitting that the continent\u2019s most progressive carbon tax would originate amid mountains, surf and forest. But the man who helped to usher it in, the former premier Gordon Campbell, rejects the notion that love for the environment is unique to the region. \u201cIf you talk to people in rural communities, in urban communities, in Ontario or Alberta, and they all care about the environment,\u201d Campbell told the Guardian. \u201cThey all want to go to pristine places.\u201d Troubled by the compounding effects of climate change he saw both at home and abroad, Campbell and his government believed a carbon tax represented the most effective way to address the problem \u2013 and it wasn\u2019t a time to point fingers. \u201cAre we willing to do something to try to stop [climate change] from taking place, to slow it down?\u201d he said. \u201cEven for people who say: \u2018It wouldn\u2019t matter, Canada could have all of the emissions in the world and it wouldn\u2019t make any difference.\u2019 That\u2019s not the point. We should do our bit.\u201d The carbon tax isn\u2019t anything new. The world\u2019s best known carbon tax to carry that name began in the European Union in 2005, with the Emissions Trading System. With initial success the price of pollution permits reached more than \u20ac20 ($22/\u00a318) for the right to emit a ton of carbon. But heavy lobbying by industry led to a massive oversupply of permits and a price crash to \u20ac3 in 2013 \u2013 far too low to drive carbon cuts. Reforms have taken the price back above \u20ac20 in recent weeks. China has seen the attraction of carbon markets as an efficient way of delivering the biggest carbon cuts at the lowest cost. Its carbon market is being established and will, on completion, be the world\u2019s biggest. In the world\u2019s second biggest polluter, the US, 10 east coast states have had a \u201ccap and trade\u201d system for carbon emissions since 2009, under which companies have their greenhouse gas emissions capped and then must trade any surplus or deficit with others. But Barack Obama, while president, was unable to pass a nationwide system. Some prominent Republicans have backed a revenue-neutral carbon tax, but with little success. Many fossil fuel companies claim to back carbon taxes, notably in Australia, where climate policy rows have toppled prime ministers. The oil giant BP is among the supporters of carbon taxes, yet recently spent $13m (\u00a310.22m) in helping to defeat a proposal in Washington state. In the rest of Canada, despite the success story in British Columbia, other provinces are dragging their heels. The prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has legislated to impose a carbon levy on reluctant provinces, generating a storm of opposition. Ontario\u2019s premier Doug Ford, who recently repealed the province\u2019s carbon tax, has called it \u201cthe worst tax ever\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame that in some places, carbon tax is seen as four-letter word,\u201d said Wu. \u201cIt\u2019s really a key tool in the toolkit to incentivise the transition to a low carbon economy and curb carbon pollution. In British Columbia, it has definitely worked.\u201d Nonetheless, the outlook for carbon taxes looks bright: 88 nations, representing more than half of global emissions, say they are or will uses carbon pricing to tackle climate change. Furthermore, some states have suggested they would impose carbon border levies on imported goods from nations that do not tax carbon. By design, the British Columbia plan was simple: it slapped a tax on any fossil fuels used for heating, electricity and transportation. Each person and business was expected to shoulder the burden of pricing pollution; no loopholes, no exemptions. In everyday life prices ticked up, most noticeably at the gas pump. Companies with emissions-intensive work passed their increased costs on to consumers. But the critical selling point of the plan \u2013 the tax\u2019s revenue neutral design \u2013 was unprecedented. With a revenue-neutral tax, the government keeps none of the money collected from the levy. Instead, it redistributes all of it \u2013 close to $1.8bn in its first three years \u2013 back to taxpayers in the form of tax cuts. As a result, the increase in energy costs for residents was offset by a tax cut of roughly equal value. Anyone willing and able to change their behaviour to reduce emissions would end up in the black. \u201cThe nice thing about the revenue-neutral carbon tax was that it didn\u2019t judge people: if you want to buy something that emits more than somebody else, you\u2019re going to pay more tax,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cPeople who wanted to have their taxes actually reduced had to change a little bit of their behaviour, and their tax load would have been reduced.\u201d Low-income residents, as well as those living in rural areas that relied more heavily on fossil fuels, received extra tax and cash benefits. The tax began as a $10/ton levy on carbon emissions, eventually reaching $30/ton by 2012. In speeches touting the tax, Campbell said the reduction in emissions would equate to removing 750,000 cars from the road in the province. The move \u2013 the first of its kind \u2013 placated both conservative economists and environmentalists. And, it worked. \u201cWe saw fossil fuel consumption decrease by more than 17% and in the rest of Canada fuel consumption increased by more than 1%,\u201d Wu said of the four-year period between 2008 and 2012, when the first tranche of increases went into effect. Fears that the tax would have a negative impact on the economy quickly melted away when the numbers came in, she said. The province grew its economy by 16%, far outpacing any other region of the country. \u201cIt was leading edge at the time,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cAnd, unfortunately, 11 years later, it\u2019s still leading edge.\u201d By 2012, when the tax reached its first maximum level ($30 per ton), 64% of the population supported it. By 2016, it garnered the support of nearly 70% of residents. In Victoria, the province\u2019s capital, residents remain unfazed over the constant increases \u2013 a testament of how the tax has drifted into the background. Devon Crosby, who has worked in the oil and gas industry for much of his career, said he has little patience for the current feud across the country. \u201cLook, I\u2019d rather pay an extra 15% on gas for a cleaner and nicer British Columbia.\u201d For others, the tax cuts outweigh any increased costs. \u201cMoney talks,\u201d said resident Kim Hollingsworth. \u201cPeople need incentives to change their behaviour.\u201d She based her decision to buy a new, more energy efficient heater on the climate rebates \u2013 part of the suite of climate policies Campbell introduced. The revenue-neutral aspect of the tax is novel but has frustrated some environmental groups, who feel the tax does not do enough to reduce emissions. Others felt it was too onerous: between 2012 and 2016 Campbell\u2019s successor as premier, Christy Clark, froze the tax and repealed a number of environmental policies. \u201cWhen the carbon tax was frozen, we saw emissions go back up,\u201d said Wu. By 2021, the tax is slated to reach $50/ton, but the current British Columbia government is examining modifying the revenue-neutral aspect of the programme in order to allocate funding for green infrastructure, deviating from its original revenue neutrality \u2013 a move Campbell feels defeats the purpose of the tax in the first place: \u201cI\u2019m not happy when we say it\u2019s going to be revenue-neutral carbon tax and it isn\u2019t really. Don\u2019t play that game with people.\u201d He remains optimistic that the current feud in the country will dissipate over time. Too many people, he says, are on the defensive, feeling the problems of climate change are not directly their fault. \u201cI think the relevant question is: are we willing to do something about it when it\u2019s happening?\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if we can help, are we willing to?\u201d Figured out The numbers that are fuelling international concerns about global warming and climate change are stark. The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased by a third over the past 100 years, to more than 400 parts per million. That has happened as a result of sharp rises in annual emissions of greenhouse gases, which have roughly doubled since 1971, to 53.5m tons of carbon dioxide equivalent. (CO2 from industrial processes and from forestry and other land uses makes up about three quarters of greenhouse gases; methane comprises another 16% and nitrous oxide about 6%). Annual global emissions flatlined for three years from 2014-2016, but rose sharply again last year. Meanwhile, over the past century, average global temperatures have risen more than 1C. The one bit of good news is the exponential rise in renewable power supplies, which have surged over the past 20 years to comprise more than 8% of global electricity generation. Under the 2015 Paris agreement, signatories are supposed to rein in carbon emissions so as to keep global temperatures from rising to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. But the 1.5C threshold is now looming, mechanisms for implementing Paris are still weak, and many observers are predicting that rises of 3C or more are now far more likely by the second half of this century.

Angela coming to steal your man. Who probably doesn\u2019t even have a degree in quantum chemistry. Your man. Once again we have the camel-eyelashed Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, looking like a smug Ken doll who can almost certainly commune with dolphins and probably uses the Amaro filter on every Instagram picture he posts, mostly of lakes. He flirts with your mum all dinner and then rolls his shirt sleeves up \u2013 maybe even takes the whole thing off \u2013 and offers to do the washing up, even though there\u2019s a dishwasher. Until next time! \u2022 Hannah Jane Parkinson is a Guardian columnist",

Their portrayal is never positive, never enriching, never human. Messaging isn\u2019t the only thing that shapes attitudes, of course. A lack of oversight may have contributed to the rise in racist bullying. A duty to monitor the issue was removed under David Cameron, something one charity said was \u201cburying the problem rather than addressing it\u201d. None of this is inevitable. The bullying of one person is a tragedy, but the bullying of millions is not a statistic \u2013 it is government policy. \u2022 Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist",

Taking action on climate change. Pushing back against Putin\u2019s aggression in Ukraine. Speaking out in support of human rights.</p> <p>But Democrats are on the back foot. Some countries that have traditionally upheld democratic norms are now represented by more populist leaders, such as Trump and Giuseppe Conte, the prime minister of Italy. Brazil elected a rightwing president in Jair Bolsonaro, who openly derides democratic ideals. The United Kingdom is mired in a slow-motion national catastrophe as it withdraws from the European Union. Democratic erosion is on the march from Hungary to Turkey, the Philippines to Poland. And without American leadership, the world\u2019s democracies are struggling to unite in the face of the autocratic tide.</p> <p>Luckily, Trump is not America. And today, voices \u2013 from new members of Congress to a growing chorus of grassroots organizations \u2013 are rising to push back against Trump\u2019s dictatorial style at home and his recklessness abroad.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Voices are rising to push back against Trump\u2019s dictatorial style at home and his recklessness abroad.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When America leads, it can achieve amazing things, from the creation of the United Nations to the reunification of Europe, peace in the Balkans to the Paris climate agreement. This was President Bush\u2019s vision, as he put it when rallying the world against Iraq in 1990: \u201cThe crisis in the Persian Gulf \u2026 offers a rare moment of opportunity to move toward an historic period of cooperation \u2026 a new world order \u2026 Today that new world is struggling to be born \u2026 A world where the rule of law supplants the rule of the jungle. A world in which nations recognize the shared responsibility for freedom and justice. A world where the strong respect the rights of the weak.\u201d</p> <p>Today, that new world is still struggling to be born, and the fate of this vision may very well rest on what President <a href=\"https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/inaugural-address\">Bush</a> prided most, service to others: \u201cI have spoken of a Thousand Points of Light, or all the community of organizations that are spread like stars throughout the Nation, doing good \u2026 The old ideas are new again because they\u2019re not old, they are timeless: duty, sacrifice, commitment, and a patriotism that finds its expression in taking part and pitching in.\u201d</p> <p>As a progressive, I disagreed with President Bush\u2019s politics and many of his policies. As a foreign policy professional, I am in awe of his achievements. As a public servant, I am inspired by his service to his country. And as an American, I am proud he was my president.</p> <p>In these troubled times, let us not discard ideas of global rules and norms like freedom and justice as \u201cold ideas\u201d \u2013 they are not old, they are timeless. America must continue to fight for them, pick up President Bush\u2019s mantle, and spark a thousand points of light as we build a new world.</p>",

Trump even openly admires how the brutal North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-un, \u201cspeaks and his people sit up at attention \u2026 I want my people to do the same.\u201d Trump\u2019s actions are undermining American democracy and resulting in a more dangerous world. On the other side are the democrats. From Merkel to Trudeau to President Moon Jae-in of South Korea, leaders of the world\u2019s democracies are standing up for the very things that have made the world a more peaceful place. Taking action on climate change. Pushing back against Putin\u2019s aggression in Ukraine. Speaking out in support of human rights. But Democrats are on the back foot. Some countries that have traditionally upheld democratic norms are now represented by more populist leaders, such as Trump and Giuseppe Conte, the prime minister of Italy. Brazil elected a rightwing president in Jair Bolsonaro, who openly derides democratic ideals. The United Kingdom is mired in a slow-motion national catastrophe as it withdraws from the European Union. Democratic erosion is on the march from Hungary to Turkey, the Philippines to Poland. And without American leadership, the world\u2019s democracies are struggling to unite in the face of the autocratic tide. Luckily, Trump is not America. And today, voices \u2013 from new members of Congress to a growing chorus of grassroots organizations \u2013 are rising to push back against Trump\u2019s dictatorial style at home and his recklessness abroad. When America leads, it can achieve amazing things, from the creation of the United Nations to the reunification of Europe, peace in the Balkans to the Paris climate agreement. This was President Bush\u2019s vision, as he put it when rallying the world against Iraq in 1990: \u201cThe crisis in the Persian Gulf \u2026 offers a rare moment of opportunity to move toward an historic period of cooperation \u2026 a new world order \u2026 Today that new world is struggling to be born \u2026 A world where the rule of law supplants the rule of the jungle. A world in which nations recognize the shared responsibility for freedom and justice. A world where the strong respect the rights of the weak.\u201d Today, that new world is still struggling to be born, and the fate of this vision may very well rest on what President Bush prided most, service to others: \u201cI have spoken of a Thousand Points of Light, or all the community of organizations that are spread like stars throughout the Nation, doing good \u2026 The old ideas are new again because they\u2019re not old, they are timeless: duty, sacrifice, commitment, and a patriotism that finds its expression in taking part and pitching in.\u201d As a progressive, I disagreed with President Bush\u2019s politics and many of his policies. As a foreign policy professional, I am in awe of his achievements. As a public servant, I am inspired by his service to his country. And as an American, I am proud he was my president. In these troubled times, let us not discard ideas of global rules and norms like freedom and justice as \u201cold ideas\u201d \u2013 they are not old, they are timeless. America must continue to fight for them, pick up President Bush\u2019s mantle, and spark a thousand points of light as we build a new world.",

Speaking at the close of the summit, May denied that the backstop element of her deal risked the UK not being able to sign any wide-reaching future trade deals with the rest of the world. \u201cIt was identified in the G20 discussions \u2026 that trade and looking at the future of trade is about more than goods,\u201d she said. One bilateral meeting that did not focus on trade was May\u2019s meeting with the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, in which the prime minister raised the issues of the war in Yemen and the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. May would not say whether she had asked the crown prince questions about his personal involvement in ordering the killing of the Washington Post columnist at the Saudi embassy in Istanbul. She said that she had told the crown prince the investigation should \u201cidentify those who were involved\u201d and said it was \u201cimportant those that are involved are held to account\u201d. Vladimir Putin, asked whether he had talked to May at the G20 summit, was vague. \u201cWe saw each other,\u201d said the Russian president. \u201cThe UK is an important partner of Russia, I hope that one day soon we will be able to overcome the difficulties we have in our relations and achieve positive trend in our cooperation which would serve the interests of both Russia and the UK.\u201d Putin also responded to comments from the UK\u2019s new army chief, General Mark Carleton-Smith, that Russia posed a greater threat to the UK than Isis. The Russian president said: \u201cWhen they make such statements and they compare us to other people, putting Russia alongside terrorist groups, it\u2019s between the people who say such things and their conscience. \u201c As for terrorists, Russia more than any country has made an important contribution to fighting terrorism. Such statements are usually stemming from politicians who want to demonstrate to their voters how tough they are.\u201d",

May said the UK had \u201cworld-class engineers and steadfast allies around the world. We are not short of options.\u201d</p> <p>Gavin Williamson, the defence secretary, said the development of a new system would be an opportunity to draw on British skills and expertise in satellite technology. \u201cSpace poses a new and increasingly dangerous front for warfare and it is crucial to push ahead with plans for our own world-class, independent satellite system,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Signs that the UK had accepted it would be forced out of the system were apparent in August when the UK Space Agency announced a \u00a392m feasibility study of a national alternative to the Galileo programme. Number 10 said a series of key contracts were now being tendered.</p> <p>The government now plans for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/25/galileo-uk-will-build-own-satellite-system-if-frozen-out-of-eu-brexit\">possible collaboration</a> on a new system with other countries such as those in the FiveEyes intelligence alliance and hopes to use some British overseas territories and Crown dependencies for a global network of locations necessary for infrastructure and worldwide coverage.</p> <p>The development of the system may be raised in several bilateral meetings May will hold with world leaders on Saturday at the G20 summit in Argentina. The prime minister will meet her Canadian and Australian counterparts, Justin Trudeau and Scott Morrison respectively. Both countries are members of the FiveEyes alliance.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was corrected on 1 December 2018. Justin Trudeau is the prime minister of Canada, not the president.</p>",

On Friday, May officially announced that the UK would be pulling out of the system and made no mention of any attempt to recoup the UK\u2019s investment. \u201cThe commission decided that we would be barred from having full aspects of the Galileo programme and so it is right for us to look for alternatives because it would be wrong to put our [armed] services relying on a system on which they couldn\u2019t be sure of,\u201d May told reporters in Buenos Aires while attending the G20 summit. \u201cThat would not be in our national interest.\u201d She added: \u201cSo what is in our national interest is to say no, you haven\u2019t allowed us full access, so we will develop an alternative, we will look at alternative options, we are doing that work but we will work with other international partners to do so as well.\u201d Whitehall sources said the issue of the \u00a31.2bn was yet to be finally resolved because the UK could still choose to be involved in commercial aspects of the system. \u201cWe will be discussing our past contributions to the financing of Galileo in the upcoming talks,\u201d a senior UK official said. Downing Street said the UK would explore options to build its own Global Navigation Satellite system to help guide military drones, run energy networks and other commercial uses. May said the UK had \u201cworld-class engineers and steadfast allies around the world. We are not short of options.\u201d Gavin Williamson, the defence secretary, said the development of a new system would be an opportunity to draw on British skills and expertise in satellite technology. \u201cSpace poses a new and increasingly dangerous front for warfare and it is crucial to push ahead with plans for our own world-class, independent satellite system,\u201d he said. Signs that the UK had accepted it would be forced out of the system were apparent in August when the UK Space Agency announced a \u00a392m feasibility study of a national alternative to the Galileo programme. Number 10 said a series of key contracts were now being tendered. The government now plans for possible collaboration on a new system with other countries such as those in the FiveEyes intelligence alliance and hopes to use some British overseas territories and Crown dependencies for a global network of locations necessary for infrastructure and worldwide coverage. The development of the system may be raised in several bilateral meetings May will hold with world leaders on Saturday at the G20 summit in Argentina. The prime minister will meet her Canadian and Australian counterparts, Justin Trudeau and Scott Morrison respectively. Both countries are members of the FiveEyes alliance. \u2022 This article was corrected on 1 December 2018. Justin Trudeau is the prime minister of Canada, not the president.",

          "bodyText": "Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke attacked the incoming chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee Raul Grijalva as a drunk after Grijalva called for his resignation. President Donald Trump insisted on Twitter that his business dealings with Russia were \u201cvery legal and very cool.\u201d The White House blamed special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation for hurting the U.S. relationship with Russia, saying: \u201cThe Russian Witch Hunt Hoax, which is hopefully now nearing an end, is doing very well. Unfortunately, it probably does undermine our relationship with Russia.\u201d Homeland Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen is reportedly asking for the military deployment along the U.S.-Mexico border to be extended into 2019. Apparently when Zinke attacked Grijalva as a drunk, the Arizona Democrat was at his favorite bar, the Tune Inn which was referenced in the tweet. Raul Grijalva has responded to the attack earlier today by Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke. In a joint statement, Jerry Nadler, the incoming chair of the House Judiciary Committee and Elijah Cummings, the incoming chair of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said that Matt Whitaker will testify before Congress in January and said he will continue to follow Justice Department policy on the Mueller investigation. This afternoon, acting Attorney General Whitaker committed to appear before the House Judiciary Committee in January at a mutually agreeable date, which we look forward to. In response to our various questions, the acting Attorney General affirmed that he was and will continue to follow all of the regulations, policies and procedures of the Department of Justice, including with regards to the Special Counsel investigation. We look forward to continued conversations in the future.\u201d The Department of Homeland Security has asked for the military presence at the U.S.- Mexico border to be extended through the end of January. Currently, the deployment is scheduled to end on December 15. There are 6,000 soldiers along the border. A federal court just finished a hearing on James Comey\u2019s efforts to quash a subpoena to testify before the House Judiciary Committee. A ruling is expected on Monday. The Wall Street Journal is reporting that acting attorney general Matt Whitaker was aware of allegations of fraud at a company he advised. Whitaker has denied knowledge of allegations of fraud at World Patent Marketing. However, the Wall Street Journal uncovered numerous email exchanges from Whitaker about consumer fraud at the company that is facing investigation from the Federal Trade Commission. Nancy Pelosi is insisting that she will not negotiate with rebels over a retirement date. Pelosi critics in the Democratic caucus are trying to get her to agree to a timeline to step down in exchange for their support for Speaker. When asked if there was a middle ground, she said \u201cBetween saying when I\u2019m going to retire or not? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d Politico is reporting that DHS secretary Kirstjen Nielsen is requesting that other government agencies provide civilian law enforcement officers to be deployed on the U.S.-Mexico border. President Donald Trump has tweeted about the earthquake in Alaska and pledged that the federal government will \u201cspare no expense\u201d on disaster relief. One 2020 election is already getting interesting and its not for President. Congressman Carlos Curbelo, who lost his bid for re-election earlier this month, is plotting a bid to be the next Mayor of Miami-Dade County. Curbelo would face a crowded field which includes Luther Campbell, the former leader of 2 Live Crew. The full roster of House Republican ranking members is now available. It includes Jim Jordan, a key figure in the hard right Freedom Caucus, as the top Republican on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee which will play a key role investigating the Trump administration. The Washington Post does a deep dive into the work requirement that Wisconsin has imposed for those seeking to receive food stamps. The goal of the program is to encourage people to find jobs but has led to a number of people losing their aid and dramatically dropped the number of people on food stamps in the state. The Washington Post reports that in his career as a pundit, acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker repeatedly criticized President Donald Trump He suggested Trump made things up \u201cout of whole cloth\u201d and called Trump\u2019s behavior \u201ca little outlandish\u201d and \u201ca little dangerous\u201d at times. Joaquin Castro has been elected the chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. The Texas Democrat\u2019s brother, Julian, is currently contemplating a bid for the White House in 2020. The Guardian\u2019s Julian Borger reports on a unique element from his youth being featured at the G20. In an interview, Claire McCaskill, the outgoing Democratic senator from Missouri has harsh words for her own party for ignoring moderates in the past election. \u201cThis demand for purity, this looking down your nose at people who want to compromise, is a recipe for disaster for the Democrats. Will we ever get to a majority in the Senate again, much less to 60, if we do not have some moderates in our party?\u201d The earthquake in Alaska seems to have damaged former Governor Sarah Palin\u2019s house. Iowa Republican Steve King called the Congressional Black Caucus \u201ca grievance committee\u201d while appearing a far right podcast that has featured white nationalists. CNN reports that controversial King appeared on the podcast. King\u2019s history of ties to the European far right led to the National Republican Campaign Committee repudiating him on the eve of the midterms. Devin Nunes will continue as the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee but only as the ranking member now that Democrats have the majority. In one key measure whose stock is rising and whose is falling in the Trump Administration, Wilbur Ross is not in Argentina for the G20. There are more questions being raised about absentee ballot fraud in Bladen county, North Carolina and whether it propelled Republicans to win a swing congressional seat. The Charlotte Observer reports: Bladen county had the highest percentage of absentee ballot requests in the state. There, 7.5% of registered voters requested absentee ballots. In most counties it was less than 3%. An analysis by Catawba College political scientist Michael Bitzer suggested more aberrations. In seven of the eight counties in the ninth district, for example, McCready won a lopsided majority of the mailed-in absentee ballots. But not in Bladen county. There, Republican Mark Harris won 61% even though registered Republicans accounted for only 19% of the county\u2019s accepted absentee ballots. An interesting moment of color of Capitol Hill today as a government shutdown deadline approaches The White House says Trump and MBS \u201cexchanged pleasantries\u201d today. Raul Grijalva, who will become the chairman of House Natural Resources Committee next year, called on Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke to resign in an op-ed in USA Today. Ryan Zinke needs to resign immediately as Secretary of the Interior. I take no pleasure in calling for this step, and I have resisted it even as questions have grown about Mr. Zinke\u2019s ethical and managerial failings. Unfortunately, his conduct in office and President Donald Trump\u2019s neglect in setting ethical standards for his own cabinet have made it unavoidable. Zinke has responded on Twitter by essentially calling Grijalva a drunk. Trump also insisted that the meeting with Putin was canceled because of the Ukraine. He told reporters \u201cwe don\u2019t like what happened, we\u2019re not happy about it, nobody is, hopefully they\u2019ll be able to settle it out soon because we look forward to meeting with President Putin but on the basis of what took place with respect to the ships and the sailors that was the sole reason.\u201d Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe just congratulated Trump \u201con his historic victory in the midterm election in the United States.\u201d That is a unique reading of the results of the midterms. Democrat John Barrow isn\u2019t pulling any stops ahead of Georgia\u2019s runoff for Secretary of State on Tuesday. In the race to be the Peach State\u2019s top elections official, Barrow has bought ad time during tomorrow\u2019s SEC championship game between Alabama and Georgia. The price for one spot, $32,000. Texas congressman Mike McCaul will become the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. McCaul, who was first elected in 2004, was one of a number of Texas Republicans to face surprisingly close races in the midterms. Republicans are warning darkly of voter fraud in California without evidence. The state\u2019s slow system of counting ballots has meant that a number of races where Republicans initially led have turned into Democratic victories. Outgoing Speaker Paul Ryan slammed the state\u2019s \u201cbizarre\u201d voting system Thursday, joining the chorus of critics. The state has a number of reasons for being slow, including that absentee ballots that arrive three days after Election Day can be counted. The result is that 41% of votes cast in the state weren\u2019t counted until after Election Day. However, there is no evidence at all of malfeasance but simply of a slow, bureaucratic process. NPR is reporting that Donald Trump Jr testified that efforts to build a Trump Tower in Moscow ended in 2014. Cohen in his plea deal said that efforts to build Trump Tower extended into 2016. As NPR reports: Trump Jr. told the Senate Judiciary Committee in September 2017 that although there had been negotiations surrounding a prospective Trump Tower in Moscow, they concluded without result \u201cat the end\u201d of 2014. \u201cBut not in 2015 or 2016?\u201d Trump Jr. was asked. \u201cCertainly not \u201816,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was never a definitive end to it. It just died of deal fatigue.\u201d The contradiction potentially could open up the President\u2019s oldest son to criminal charges for lying to Congress. However, it appears Trump Jr may have been talking about a different deal in Moscow than the one Cohen was specifically handling. Virginia Republican Ben Cline won the office lottery on Capitol Hill. He will get first pick of office space of the entire freshman class. Cline was elected last month from a safe Republican district in the Shenandoah Valley. Six White House employees have been reprimanded for violating the Hatch Act by tweeting #MAGA on their official Twitter accounts. This was considered to violate the law against engaging in forbidden partisan political activity. The offending tweets have been deleted but in a ruling the Office of Special Counsel said \u201cwe have decided not to pursue disciplinary action and are closing their files without further action.\u201d It did make clear the six \u201chave been advised that if in the future they engage in prohibited political activity while employed in a position covered by the Hatch Act, we will consider such activity to be a willful and knowing violation of the law, which could result in further action.\u201d Washington Congressman Dan Newhouse is getting married at the Capitol today. Our Revolution, the outside group founded in the aftermath of Bernie Sanders\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign was bilked out of nearly a quarter of a million dollars in a email scam. The scam happened in December 2016 and was uncovered shortly thereafter. However, it was not publicly disclosed until now because the group is a dark money organization that is set up as a \u201csocial welfare\u201d nonprofit and not a political action committee which limits scrutiny. Utah Governor Gary Herbert has criticized Trump for his comments earlier this month about Mia Love, the Utah congresswoman who lost her bid for re-election. Maryland Governor Larry Hogan refused to rule out a presidential bid in 2020. The Republican who was just elected to a second term leading the deep blue state of Maryland was asked about 2020 at the meeting of the Republican Governors Association in Scottsdale, Arizona. Hogan has been floated as one of several potential Republican challengers to Trump in 2020. Trump may not be formally meeting with Putin in Buenos Aires but the Russian president is bonding with another world leader The big excitement today on Capitol Hill will be the office lottery for incoming members. They each draw numbers to decide which order they get to pick new offices in hopes of getting a decent workspace. Sarah Sanders has put out a statement on canceled meeting with Putin at the G20, blaming Russian aggression in the Ukraine not Michael Cohen for the cancellation and saying that Mueller\u2019s probe \u201cundermine[s] our relationship with Russia.\u201d \u201cThe Russian Witch Hunt Hoax, which is hopefully now nearing an end, is doing very well. Unfortunately, it probably does undermine our relationship with Russia. However, the reason for our canceled meeting is Ukraine. Hopefully, that will be resolved soon so that productive conversations can begin.\u201d The status hearing on Paul Manafort has just wrapped up in Washington, D.C. The big news is that prosecutors are considering retrying him on the dropped charges that a hung jury deadlocked on in August now that his cooperation agreement has fallen apart. Elizabeth Warren is currently in third place in her home state of Massachusetts in a poll of potential 2020 contenders. Massachusetts is not an early state and the poll included two other Bay States, former governor Deval Patrick and Congressman Seth Moulton but still represents an interesting data point. In response to the reports that Trump and Putin might have an impromptu meeting at the G20, a White House official just told reporters: \u201cthere is no scheduled pull aside.\u201d Buzzfeed reported yesterday that Trump planned to give Vladimir Putin a $50 million penthouse at Trump Tower Moscow if the project was approved. These conversations happened during the 2016 presidential campaign. Florida could have three different governors in January. Outgoing governor Rick Scott was elected to the Senate in November but while his Senate term starts on January 3, his replacement as Governor, Ron DeSantis, won\u2019t be sworn in until January 8. This means that if Scott resigns to start his Senate term on time, Lieutenant Governor Carlos Lopez Cantera will get to lead the state for a few days. If Lopez Cantera serves, he will be both the first Jewish and the first Cuban American governor of the state. This morning, Democrats will unveil the first bill that they hope to pass in January. H.R. 1 will contain ethics, campaign finance and voting rights provisions. The Washington Post reports: Elements of the legislation, according to a draft outline reviewed by The Washington Post, include new donor disclosure requirements for political organizations, a system to multiply small donations to political campaigns, mandating a new ethical code for the Supreme Court, ending most first-class travel for federal officeholders, and a broad effort to expand voting access and reduce partisan gerrymandering. Former RNC chair and White House chief of staff Reince Priebus will lead a review for the Wisconsin Republican Party of where things went wrong in the midterms. Democrats defeated two-term incumbent governor Scott Walker in the Badger State and incumbent senator Tammy Baldwin easily fended off a Republican challenger after Trump won the state narrowly in 2016. Trump may have a brief meeting with Vladimir Putin after all, according to Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. Peskov was cited in court documents yesterday after it was revealed Michael Cohen had lied about his contacts with Peskov\u2019s office. President Donald Trump signed the USMCA, his successor to NAFTA, this morning in Argentina with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto. The negotiation of the deal led to an increase in tensions with Canada, particularly over American access to the Canadian dairy market. Former attorney general Eric Holder is heading to Iowa in February. Holder has mused about a potential 2020 campaign and hit the stump for Democrats in advance of the midterm elections. Growing evidence of fraud in North Carolina is raising questions about the result in the state\u2019s Ninth Congressional District. Republican Mark Harris currently has a 905 vote lead over Democrat Dan McCready. However, allegations of absentee ballot fraud in Bladen County have kept the state from certifying the election. As the Washington Post reports: The board is collecting sworn statements from voters in rural Bladen and Robeson counties, near the South Carolina border, who described people coming to their doors and urging them to hand over their absentee ballots, sometimes without filling them out. Others described receiving absentee ballots by mail that they had not requested. It is illegal to take someone else\u2019s ballot and turn it in. Good morning. Donald Trump defended his attempt to build a Trump Tower in Moscow as \u201cvery legal &amp; very cool\u201d on Twitter, the controversial nomination of Thomas Farr to the federal bench was torpedoed by Republican Tim Scott last night and the president is in Argentina for the G20 summit. It\u2019s Friday in American politics.",

Must-reads How Knickers the giant steer went viral He\u2019s 6ft 4in tall and weighs 220 stone. Knickers the Holstein Friesian isn\u2019t quite the world\u2019s biggest cow, but as of this week he might be its most famous. His Australian owner, Geoff Pearson, tells Kate Lyons how the seven-year-old steer became a viral sensation.

Jobs looked precarious as recently as 2009, when GM Canada was on the verge of bankruptcy, saved only by a last-minute $10bn loan from the Canadian government. Jerry Dias, president of Unifor, the Canadian car workers union, is angry. In a fiery speech to more than a thousand employees, the union leader pledged to challenge the decision, lobbying as high was possible. \u201cThey are not closing our damn plant without one hell of a fight,\u201d he told a frustrated crowd. On Tuesday afternoon, he met Trudeau in Ottawa \u2013 an indication of the critical influence of the plant on both the city and the broader Canadian economy. The abrupt closure has become fodder for politicians of all stripes, each blaming the other\u2019s present or past policies for leading to GM\u2019s decisions. But for many employees, politics was a secondary concern. First and foremost: the closure felt like the ultimate betrayal of their loyalty. \u201cI\u2019ve always said, if you come to my house, you\u2019d better be driving a GM car,\u201d said Wheeler, a 34-year veteran of the company. \u201cNot any more. How can I support a company that stabs its employees in the back right before Christmas?\u201d",

On my right, in the blue corner, president of the United States of America, Donald Trump. The venue: the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/g20\" title=\"\">G20 summit</a> in Buenos Aires. The prize: Undisputed champion of the world!</p> <p>OK. The analogy is a little fanciful. But depictions of the looming showdown between the leaders of the world\u2019s two biggest economies as <a href=\"https://asiasociety.org/policy-institute/united-states-and-china-relationship-adrift\" title=\"\">the \u201cfight of the century\u201d</a> are not wholly wide of the mark. Much is riding on whether Xi and Trump will settle their differences \u2013 or plunge the planet into a new age of uncertainty and, some analysts warn, a new cold war.</p> <p>Speaking last week, Trump agreed it was a big moment. \u201cI\u2019m very prepared. I\u2019ve been preparing for it all my life,\u201d he said. China \u201cwants to make a deal and we\u2019re very happy with that\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-23/trump-xi-signal-readiness-for-trade-talks-ahead-of-g-20-meeting\" title=\"\">Officials in Beijing</a> were more cautious. China \u201chopes the Xi-Trump meeting goes smoothly,\u201d said foreign affairs vice-minister Wang Chao. The markets are certainly nervous. Three rounds of punitive Trump tariffs on $200bn worth of Chinese goods, with the threat of more to come in January, have knocked Chinese stocks for six, down 27% year-on-year. US technology company shares have been hit by Chinese retaliation. Investors are watching closely. An impasse or worse, a row, could have serious implications for the global economy.</p> <p>Observers also note Trump\u2019s habit of behaving badly at international gatherings. He wrecked June\u2019s G7 summit in Canada, trashing the final communique and insulting his host, Justin Trudeau. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-46168995\" title=\"\">His disruptive antics</a> at the Paris Armistice day ceremonies were widely criticised.</p> <p>There are already signs of discord in Buenos Aires. China said it hoped the summit would send a clear signal on supporting a multilateral system of trade and cooperation. But the draft joint statement reportedly does not contain the G20\u2019s customary, explicit call to fight protectionism. It also backs away from previous commitments on climate change \u2013 presumably at Trump\u2019s insistence.</p> <p>Xi and Trump have met before. During a Beijing state visit last November, Trump praised his Chinese counterpart, saying the two enjoyed \u201cgreat chemistry\u201d. But the mercurial US leader seemed to change his mind about his chum when he imposed trade sanctions, complaining of a lack of a level playing field. After initially welcoming Xi\u2019s help, Trump later claimed Beijing was undermining his attempts to get North Korea to denuclearise.</p> <p>Relations took a definitive turn for the worse last month when Mike Pence, the US vice-president, launched a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/04/mike-pence-china-us-elections-meddling\" title=\"\">furious, deliberately timed attack on Beijing</a>, a pummelling subsequently likened to Churchill\u2019s 1946 Iron Curtain speech foreshadowing the cold war.</p> <p>\u201cPence signalled a fundamental shift in US policy on China: from half a century of engagement following Richard Nixon\u2019s China visit in 1972, back to the containment once championed by cold war hawks,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/united-states/article/2168771/friends-donald-trump-xi-jinping-doesnt-need\" title=\"\">wrote Cary Huang</a> in the South China Morning Post.</p> <p>\u201cAmerica hoped economic liberalisation would bring China into a greater partnership with us and the world. Instead, China has chosen economic aggression, which has, in turn, emboldened its growing military,\u201d Pence said. Xi was using \u201can arsenal of policies inconsistent with free and fair trade, including tariffs, quotas, currency manipulation, forced technology transfers, intellectual property theft and industrial subsidies handed out like candy\u201d.</p> <p>It was a swingeing assault that also targeted China\u2019s lamentable human rights record, alleged meddling in the US mid-term elections, and what Pence called \u201cdebt diplomacy\u201d \u2013 strings-attached investment in prestige infrastructure projects in developing countries, notably the $1 trillion, 64-country <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/12/the-900bn-question-what-is-the-belt-and-road-initiative\" title=\"\">Belt and Road initiative</a>.</p> <p>It was as though a host of half-submerged American concerns, including Xi\u2019s efforts to isolate Taiwan\u2019s \u201cseparatists\u201d and the militarisation of the South China Sea, had suddenly burst to the surface all at once.</p> <p>The onslaught had probably been coming for a while. As American power declines relative to China, the apparent consensus among US politicians, military leaders and businesses is that a period of competition and confrontation is inescapable. Analyst Minxin Pei said the shift reflected hard economic realities: in 2000, China\u2019s GDP was 13% that of the US; by 2017, it had reached 63%. On these trends, <a href=\"https://www.chinausfocus.com/article/2018/1114/17459.html\" title=\"\">China could soon</a> eclipse the US in sheer economic clout.</p> <p>Is a new superpower cold war inevitable? Commentators <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/china-has-a-plan-to-rule-the-world/2017/11/28/214299aa-d472-11e7-a986-d0a9770d9a3e_story.html?utm_term=.3aef0092adef\" title=\"\">such as David Ignatius</a> suggest that if it is, China, with its clearer vision and greater energy, is set to win. Trump\u2019s isolationist \u201cAmerica First\u201d policies were unintentionally facilitating China\u2019s build-up, Ignatius wrote last year. Tariffs and angry words were no substitute for a global strategy.</p> <p>Perhaps aknockout in Buenos Aires can be avoided. Trump seems to want a trade war truce. Minxin Pei said Xi should offer concessions on security issues to avoid <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/2174333/white-house-trade-adviser-peter-navarro-excluded-xi-jinping\" title=\"\">a \u201ccalamitous cold war\u201d</a> and preserve a favourable global environment in which China could maintain its steady advance.</p> <p>If he\u2019s smart, Xi will take the advice \u2013 and take it on the chin. Given Trump\u2019s blinkered, introspective outlook, the crumbling of the post-1945 international order, and a divided Europe\u2019s chronic weakness, China has never had a better shot at the title of world No 1.</p>",

Much is riding on whether Xi and Trump will settle their differences \u2013 or plunge the planet into a new age of uncertainty and, some analysts warn, a new cold war. Speaking last week, Trump agreed it was a big moment. \u201cI\u2019m very prepared. I\u2019ve been preparing for it all my life,\u201d he said. China \u201cwants to make a deal and we\u2019re very happy with that\u201d. Officials in Beijing were more cautious. China \u201chopes the Xi-Trump meeting goes smoothly,\u201d said foreign affairs vice-minister Wang Chao. The markets are certainly nervous. Three rounds of punitive Trump tariffs on $200bn worth of Chinese goods, with the threat of more to come in January, have knocked Chinese stocks for six, down 27% year-on-year. US technology company shares have been hit by Chinese retaliation. Investors are watching closely. An impasse or worse, a row, could have serious implications for the global economy. Observers also note Trump\u2019s habit of behaving badly at international gatherings. He wrecked June\u2019s G7 summit in Canada, trashing the final communique and insulting his host, Justin Trudeau. His disruptive antics at the Paris Armistice day ceremonies were widely criticised. There are already signs of discord in Buenos Aires. China said it hoped the summit would send a clear signal on supporting a multilateral system of trade and cooperation. But the draft joint statement reportedly does not contain the G20\u2019s customary, explicit call to fight protectionism. It also backs away from previous commitments on climate change \u2013 presumably at Trump\u2019s insistence. Xi and Trump have met before. During a Beijing state visit last November, Trump praised his Chinese counterpart, saying the two enjoyed \u201cgreat chemistry\u201d. But the mercurial US leader seemed to change his mind about his chum when he imposed trade sanctions, complaining of a lack of a level playing field. After initially welcoming Xi\u2019s help, Trump later claimed Beijing was undermining his attempts to get North Korea to denuclearise. Relations took a definitive turn for the worse last month when Mike Pence, the US vice-president, launched a furious, deliberately timed attack on Beijing, a pummelling subsequently likened to Churchill\u2019s 1946 Iron Curtain speech foreshadowing the cold war. \u201cPence signalled a fundamental shift in US policy on China: from half a century of engagement following Richard Nixon\u2019s China visit in 1972, back to the containment once championed by cold war hawks,\u201d wrote Cary Huang in the South China Morning Post. \u201cAmerica hoped economic liberalisation would bring China into a greater partnership with us and the world. Instead, China has chosen economic aggression, which has, in turn, emboldened its growing military,\u201d Pence said. Xi was using \u201can arsenal of policies inconsistent with free and fair trade, including tariffs, quotas, currency manipulation, forced technology transfers, intellectual property theft and industrial subsidies handed out like candy\u201d. It was a swingeing assault that also targeted China\u2019s lamentable human rights record, alleged meddling in the US mid-term elections, and what Pence called \u201cdebt diplomacy\u201d \u2013 strings-attached investment in prestige infrastructure projects in developing countries, notably the $1 trillion, 64-country Belt and Road initiative. It was as though a host of half-submerged American concerns, including Xi\u2019s efforts to isolate Taiwan\u2019s \u201cseparatists\u201d and the militarisation of the South China Sea, had suddenly burst to the surface all at once. The onslaught had probably been coming for a while. As American power declines relative to China, the apparent consensus among US politicians, military leaders and businesses is that a period of competition and confrontation is inescapable. Analyst Minxin Pei said the shift reflected hard economic realities: in 2000, China\u2019s GDP was 13% that of the US; by 2017, it had reached 63%. On these trends, China could soon eclipse the US in sheer economic clout. Is a new superpower cold war inevitable? Commentators such as David Ignatius suggest that if it is, China, with its clearer vision and greater energy, is set to win. Trump\u2019s isolationist \u201cAmerica First\u201d policies were unintentionally facilitating China\u2019s build-up, Ignatius wrote last year. Tariffs and angry words were no substitute for a global strategy. Perhaps aknockout in Buenos Aires can be avoided. Trump seems to want a trade war truce. Minxin Pei said Xi should offer concessions on security issues to avoid a \u201ccalamitous cold war\u201d and preserve a favourable global environment in which China could maintain its steady advance. If he\u2019s smart, Xi will take the advice \u2013 and take it on the chin. Given Trump\u2019s blinkered, introspective outlook, the crumbling of the post-1945 international order, and a divided Europe\u2019s chronic weakness, China has never had a better shot at the title of world No 1.",

With its \u201cpox on both your houses\u201d sensibility, The Hell of Good Intentions is worth the read even if its embrace of Nixonian \u201coffshore balancing\u201d as a strategy will likely find few takers in the corridors of power.

A 2007 book, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/aug/10/politicalbooks1\">The Israel Lobby and US Foreign Policy</a>, co-authored with John Mearsheimer of the University of Chicago, won the pair <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/06/books/06grim.html\">few new friends</a>; it is unlikely The Hell of Good Intentions will earn many more. Still, the book provides further connective tissue for Trump\u2019s ascendance and the acceptance of \u201cAmerica first\u201d by broad swaths of the electorate, if not the establishment.</p> <p>As is to be expected, Walt is unsparing of both neoconservative and muscular liberal approaches to foreign affairs. He reminds us that the Iraq war and its aftermath was a bipartisan failure, however noble (or not) the intentions of its architects. Although George W Bush was president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/sep/03/every-day-is-extra-review-john-kerry-vietnam-syria-trump\">John Kerry</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/18/what-happened-hillary-rodham-clinton-review\">Hillary Clinton</a> backed the invasion. Then they each ran unsuccessfully for president and served unremarkably as secretaries of state.</p> <p>Walt also chronicles the lack of evolution among unrepentant hawks. Marco Rubio continues to argue that \u201c<a href=\"https://www.wonkette.com/marco-rubio-gets-his-chance-to-flub-iraq-question-nails-it\">it was not a mistake to go into Iraq</a>\u201d.

Each also aspired to the White House. To think what might have been.</p> <p>As for Trump, Walt minces few words. As he frames things, the US \u201ccontinues to embrace a flawed strategy but its implementation is now in the hands of the least competent president in modern memory\u201d. According to Walt, the Trump presidency \u201cprovides a textbook case for how <em>not </em>to fix things\u201d.</p> <p>If Walt needed further proof, the weeks following the midterm elections and the emergent blue wave have provided ample backup \u2013 from Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/13/trump-macron-eu-army-german-second-world-war\">debacle in France</a> to his dyspeptic telephone conversation with Prime Minister Theresa May, to reports of North Korea\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/12/north-korea-missile-launch-sites-photo-nuclear-disarmament\">march to further militarization</a>, to the president\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/23/i-made-a-tremendous-difference-trump-heaps-thanksgiving-praise-on-himself\">Thanksgiving Day performance art</a>.

Even before the murder of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/jamal-khashoggi\">Jamal Khashoggi</a>, Walt took Trump to task for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/22/trump-cia-saudi-crown-prince-jamal-khashoggi-murder\">aligning with Mohammed bin Salman</a> \u201cwhile turning a blind eye toward the prince\u2019s reckless\u201d ventures in Yemen.</p> <p>As his policy of choice, Walt calls for offshore balancing, a strategy that would primarily rely upon \u201cregional actors to uphold local balances of power and commit the United States to intervene with its own forces only when one or more of those balances was in danger of breaking down\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/22/trump-cia-saudi-crown-prince-jamal-khashoggi-murder\">Trump: CIA 'didn't conclude' Saudi crown prince ordered Khashoggi death</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The suggestion echoes the Nixon doctrine. Against the backdrop of Vietnam, Richard Nixon announced that the US \u201cwould assist in the defense and developments of allies and friends\u201d but would not \u201cundertake all the defense of the free nations of the world\u201d. In other words, not every crisis warranted American troops and firepower.</p> <p>Not surprisingly, Walt narrowly defines national interests and observes that American actions can engender resentment and blowback.

          "bodyText": "The cold war ended but history marches on. Iraq didn\u2019t work out, the Taliban is still standing in Afghanistan. Even before the 2016 election, nationalism was resurgent in the US and abroad. America has spent nearly $6tn on a never-ending global war on terror. The short-lived reality of the US sitting atop a unipolar global order is over. When in April 2016 Donald Trump announced that \u201cour foreign policy is a complete and total disaster\u201d, he struck a chord with many Americans. The hard-headed idealism and diplomacy of Ronald Reagan and George HW Bush had given way to overreach and romanticism. Flyover country mourned its dead and nursed its wounded while the children of the elites remained safely ensconced on the sidelines, awash in the gains of a globalized economy. Casualty counts in battleground states likely made Trump\u2019s presidential ambitions a reality. Enter Stephen Walt and The Hell of Good Intentions, which places the onus of US decline on its foreign policy establishment, hegemonic liberalism as an article of faith, and a lack of accountability for collective failure. As Walt sees it, it is easier to be wrong with a chorus standing behind you than to be right at the price of being branded an outlier. As he rankles and finger-points, Walt\u2019s prose flows smoothly. With its \u201cpox on both your houses\u201d sensibility, The Hell of Good Intentions is worth the read even if its embrace of Nixonian \u201coffshore balancing\u201d as a strategy will likely find few takers in the corridors of power. The distance between \u201cAmerican leadership\u201d and \u201cWe\u2019re America, bitch\u201d is not that great. A professor at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School, Walt is no stranger to controversy. A 2007 book, The Israel Lobby and US Foreign Policy, co-authored with John Mearsheimer of the University of Chicago, won the pair few new friends; it is unlikely The Hell of Good Intentions will earn many more. Still, the book provides further connective tissue for Trump\u2019s ascendance and the acceptance of \u201cAmerica first\u201d by broad swaths of the electorate, if not the establishment. As is to be expected, Walt is unsparing of both neoconservative and muscular liberal approaches to foreign affairs. He reminds us that the Iraq war and its aftermath was a bipartisan failure, however noble (or not) the intentions of its architects. Although George W Bush was president, John Kerry and Hillary Clinton backed the invasion. Then they each ran unsuccessfully for president and served unremarkably as secretaries of state. Walt also chronicles the lack of evolution among unrepentant hawks. Marco Rubio continues to argue that \u201cit was not a mistake to go into Iraq\u201d. Lindsey Graham blames Barack Obama for \u201cthe mess in Iraq and Syria, not President Bush\u201d. Thousands of dead later, Jeb Bush still thinks \u201cpremature withdrawal was the fatal error\u201d. Each also aspired to the White House. To think what might have been. As for Trump, Walt minces few words. As he frames things, the US \u201ccontinues to embrace a flawed strategy but its implementation is now in the hands of the least competent president in modern memory\u201d. According to Walt, the Trump presidency \u201cprovides a textbook case for how not to fix things\u201d. If Walt needed further proof, the weeks following the midterm elections and the emergent blue wave have provided ample backup \u2013 from Trump\u2019s debacle in France to his dyspeptic telephone conversation with Prime Minister Theresa May, to reports of North Korea\u2019s march to further militarization, to the president\u2019s Thanksgiving Day performance art. Trump frequently thunders but with the notable exception of the negation of the Iran deal he seldom persuades and less frequently endears. Lying to Canada\u2019s Justin Trudeau and then bragging about it adds neither luster nor credibility. Even before the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, Walt took Trump to task for aligning with Mohammed bin Salman \u201cwhile turning a blind eye toward the prince\u2019s reckless\u201d ventures in Yemen. As his policy of choice, Walt calls for offshore balancing, a strategy that would primarily rely upon \u201cregional actors to uphold local balances of power and commit the United States to intervene with its own forces only when one or more of those balances was in danger of breaking down\u201d. The suggestion echoes the Nixon doctrine. Against the backdrop of Vietnam, Richard Nixon announced that the US \u201cwould assist in the defense and developments of allies and friends\u201d but would not \u201cundertake all the defense of the free nations of the world\u201d. In other words, not every crisis warranted American troops and firepower. Not surprisingly, Walt narrowly defines national interests and observes that American actions can engender resentment and blowback. Nation-building and attempts at counter-insurgency have a way of stepping on too many toes. Troops are not always warmly welcomed even when they are invited, as Osama bin Laden and 9/11 gruesomely reminded us. Walt, however, is also not immune from soft-pedaling would-be malefactors. The author acknowledges that Iran \u201cmastered the full nuclear fuel cycle\u201d and came \u201cwithin striking distance of a weapons capability\u201d, but he readily discounts the possibility that Iran harbors ambitions as a regional hegemon. Likewise, he once saw a promising future between the US and Libya\u2019s Muammar Gaddafi. As Walt wrote prematurely, in 2010: \u201cMy own view (even before I visited) is that the improvement of US-Libyan relations as one of the few (only?) success stories in recent US Middle East diplomacy.\u201d Gaddafi ended up sacked and killed, in the midst of civil war. The debacle of Benghazi followed. In the end, Walt\u2019s contribution is in reminding us of the folly of grand ambitions. Ultimately, \u201cdoing something\u201d can be far costlier than watching and waiting.",

          "bodyText": "Papua New Guinea has literally rolled out the red carpet for Chinese president Xi Jinping who arrived in Port Moresby ahead of the Apec Leaders Forum this weekend. Xi, the first Chinese leader to take part in a state visit to the nation, touched down on Friday, days before other leaders are due to arrive for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit. After leaving the airport, the Chinese president was driven along the new \u201cIndependence Boulevard\u201d outside PNG\u2019s parliament \u2013 a road that was funded by a Chinese loan. At the end he was met by a military band and traditional dancers dressed in parrot feathers, possum pelts and seashell necklaces. Across the capital, images of Xi beamed down from massive billboards and the streets were lined with high school students, some waving Chinese flags. Xi is in town to open the road and a school \u2013 also funded by Beijing \u2013 and meet with Pacific island leaders ahead of the Apec summit this weekend, which will be attended by other world leaders including Mike Pence, Justin Trudeau, Rodrigo Duterte, Scott Morrison and Jacinda Ardern. The summit is being hosted in PNG, the poorest member of the Apec bloc, with Australia and China contributing significantly toward the summit. Both countries are vying for influence in the Pacific and Apec has developed into a tug-of-war for regional influence between Australia and China, a fight some commentators think Xi has already won. PNG has already signed up to Beijing\u2019s trillion-dollar \u201cBelt and Road Initiative\u201d that seeks to enhance sea and land trade routes between the Middle Kingdom and Eurasia. Prominent PNG writer and activist Martyn Namorong described the summit as \u201cXiPEC\u201d and Jonathan Pryke, from Sydney thinktank the Lowy Institute, said Apec was going to be \u201cthe China show\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve heard he\u2019s the guest of government,\u201d Pryke told the Guardian ahead of the summit. \u201cHe\u2019s staying in PNG and he\u2019s hosting a meeting with the Pacific island leaders on the sideline of the leaders meeting and I imagine there will be a lot of big announcements \u2013 more investment, more aid.\u201d In an opinion piece published ahead of the visit, Xi vowed to \u201clend fresh impetus to our common development\u201d and \u201cexpand practical co-operation with Pacific Island countries in trade and investment.\u201d Donald Trump is skipping the two-day Apec meeting, sending Pence \u2013 who is flying in from the Australian city of Cairns for one day \u2013 in his place. The lead-up to the summit has been marked by scandal. The prime minister came under attack after it was revealed that the Papua New Guinea government had bought 40 Maseratis and three luxury Bentleys to ferry leaders around, despite the country suffering from a polio outbreak and dramatic increases in tuberculosis and malaria cases, as well as funding shortages for health and education. Prime Minister Peter O\u2019Neill bristled when asked about this ahead of the summit, snapping at journalists: \u201cDid you ask the same question in Vietnam when they had the 400 plus Audis?\u201d \u201cI think it is just an overrated discussion. I\u2019m not going to give it the credibility or credit it deserves,\u201d he said. O\u2019Neill also faced calls to resign this week, after the Guardian revealed that a company he owned secured a $32.86m government contract to build bridges in the country in a process that may have violated anticorruption guidelines.

So, I\u2019m very happy with Apec to be honest with you.\u201d Bird said corruption was rife in Papua New Guinea. \u201cThere\u2019s only so much everyone can take,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d like to see all of these things investigated and brought to the light of day.\u201d Gary Juffa, the governor of Oro, said he did not think it was likely that any action would be taken against the prime minister over his company\u2019s involvement with the bridge-building contract. \u201cIn an ideal world he\u2019d be investigated for these allegations,\u201d said Juffa. \u201cI\u2019ve kind of lost faith in the investigative arms of Papua New Guinea in that they\u2019re not as active as they ought to be, they used to be.\u201d Asked how much confidence he had in the prime minister, Juffa said he had \u201cabsolutely none\u201d, adding Papua New Guineans deserved better than Peter O\u2019Neill. \u201cThis country has many great people, honourable people, good people and they deserve better than this,\u201d he said. \u201cThey deserve a prime minister that actually cares, a prime minister who gives a shit for his people and protects the interests of the people and the interests of the nation.\u201d",
