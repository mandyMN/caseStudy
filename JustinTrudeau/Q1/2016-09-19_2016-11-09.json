Here are three good articles that address this.</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/bagehot/2016/11/mr-brexit-and-britain\"><strong>Jeremy Cliffe at the Economist says a Trump presidency will make Brexit harder.</strong></a></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A single theme unifies these risks. Brexit is a giant shock to Britain\u2019s place in the world. It will sever old links and require new ones to be forged. As some of its keenest proponents concede, this transition will bring painful costs. Most of all it demands lots of good will and flexibility on all sides. In so far as Mr Trump\u2019s win means a meaner, more fractious, more volatile global order, it raises those costs and shrinks that space for compromise and consensus essential for a smooth Brexit.</p> <p>Limiting the damage of a Trump presidency on a Brexiting Britain demands ambition and perspective from Mrs May. Her approach should be two-sided. First, build a new, closer alliance with Angela Merkel, not just on Brexit but on wider issues: the world economy, security, Russia and China. In Berlin and other European capitals officials complain that June\u2019s referendum result has taken Britain\u2019s mind off all other matters. The prime minister must not allow that to happen and instead work with Mrs Merkel as a bloc capable of countering Mr Trump\u2019s worst traits.</p> <p>Second, Mrs May should use Britain\u2019s influence in America (which is significant, if not as much as Britons like to imagine) to attempt to moderate the new president, staying his hand when he does wrong and indulging his vanity when he does right. Mrs May already had her hands full with Brexit. Now, for Britain\u2019s sake and that of the world, she must also deal with Mr Brexit himself.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2016/11/what-brexit-and-donald-trump-can-teach-centre-left-about-politics\">Will Straw, executive director of Britain Stronger in Europe, at the New Statesman looks at what the left can learn from the Trump and Brexit victories.</a></strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A new politics is necessary, one with the seeds of dignity. We must find our way to a prosperity which gives people a greater sense of belonging; where communities have more autonomy to judge their own affairs, and where international cooperation is used to tackle the worst excesses of globalisation, including tax avoidance, human trafficking and illegal immigration.</p> <p>So, too, do we need a new language of politics \u2013 one that refuses to pander to prejudice but recognises that what the social psychologist Jonathan Haidt calls the \u201cmoral octaves\u201d which those on the left cannot hear. For example, imagine that there are concentric circles of loyalty \u2013 family, community, country - which are not just a comfort blanket in times of crises, but are hardwired into us as human beings.</p> <p>From this perspective, overt displays of patriotism which may make liberals uncomfortable can in fact be harnessed, and used to reinforce positive values. Larry Summers, an academic and former adviser to Barack Obama, has called it \u201cresponsible nationalism\u201d which \u201cstarts from the idea that the basic responsibility of government is to maximise the welfare of citizens, not to pursue some abstract concept of the global good\u201d.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://capx.co/will-the-special-relationship-survive/\"><strong>Bill Emmott at CapX asks if the special relationship can survive.</strong></a></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We cannot know in advance how protectionist the US is going to become. But we can know that Britain, as a trading nation wanting to buy and sell freely with the whole world, is likely to be a loser if protectionism really does become the flavour of the era.</p> <p>At least the traditionally close relationship between our intelligence services and those of America can still be depended upon. But it is not going to be a comfortable or predictable ride.</p> <p>Theresa May and Boris Johnson had better mean it when they say that post-Brexit Britain will have a great new partnership with our European friends and neighbours. We\u2019re going to need it.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-582336f5e4b0199b93895271\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-09T14:54:11.218Z\">2.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Tom Raines</strong>, a researcher at Chatham House, the foreign policy thinktank, has posted an interesting thread on Twitter about the implications of Donald Trump\u2019s win for UK foreign policy.</p> <p>He implicitly defends Theresa May\u2019s decision not to express any reservations about Trump today.

Carswell, who is much more liberal and pro-immigration than Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, says he thinks Trump could end up persuading Congress to adopt a New Deal-style, big government agenda.</p> <p>Here\u2019s an extract.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In his acceptance speech, the President-elect talked about new infrastructure spending, creating new jobs. That idea is reminiscent of the 1930s \u2013 in America, that is. It harks back to FDR\u2019s New Deal.</p> <p>Indeed, throughout the campaign, Trump has drawn policies from both left and right. He has taken protectionism from the Democrats, and a tougher stance on immigration from the Republicans. He has attacked political correctness, but, at the same time, ignored much of the socially conservative culture war. He has pledged to cut taxes, but not to cut welfare.</p> <p>That might explain how Trump has managed to do what no other Republican presidential candidate has done since the 1980s: run the table across the so-called Rust Belt states.</p> <p>The danger is that, having promised change, Trump\u2019s presidency just brings more of the same. Borrowing to fund infrastructure and entitlements will come at a huge long-term cost. Statist stimulus doesn\u2019t usually produce the kind of sustainable economic boom Trump has promised. At least, it didn\u2019t for FDR. Or, for that matter, Obama.</p> <p>But the irony is that, after years of gridlock between the President and Congress, it could be the man Democrats despise more than any other who enables bipartisanship. With Trump in the White House, Republicans in Congress may end up backing a big-government agenda similar to the one they have trenchantly opposed for much of the last eight years.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5823090fe4b0199b93895155\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-09T11:55:57.446Z\">11.55am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is is more reaction to Donald Trump\u2019s victory from Labour figures.</p> <p>From<strong> Clive Lewis</strong>, the shadow business secretary</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/labourlewis/status/796285596398452736\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Dont u think now might be the time to show a little humility abt how the &#39;third way&#39; contributed to this mess? <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/trump?src=hash\">#trump</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/brexit?src=hash\">#brexit</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CoffeeandCave\">@CoffeeandCave</a></p>&mdash; Clive Lewis MP (@labourlewis) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/labourlewis/status/796285596398452736\">November 9, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>From<strong> Richard Burgon</strong>, the shadow justice secretary</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RichardBurgon/status/796281120186892289\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Deeply worrying that Trump - given what he has said and given what he has done - elected as leader of the most powerful country on earth.</p>&mdash; Richard Burgon MP (@RichardBurgon) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RichardBurgon/status/796281120186892289\">November 9, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RichardBurgon/status/796293794941599744\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">For what it&#39;s worth, some of my thoughts on Donald Trump being elected as President of the United States of America: <a href=\"https://t.co/YwxaIUBh8r\">pic.twitter.com/YwxaIUBh8r</a></p>&mdash; Richard Burgon MP (@RichardBurgon) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RichardBurgon/status/796293794941599744\">November 9, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>From <strong>Ian Austin </strong>MP</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/IanAustinMP/status/796274394284707840\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Putin&#39;s managed to stop celebrating to congratulate Trump.

There has been little so far, because ministers and MPs are still trying to make sense of the result. Downing Street and the British foreign policy establishment have very few links with Trump and his campaign and Theresa May and her advisers will be trying to work out whether the next American president is the provocative, trigger-happy narcissist who campaigned for the job or the man who addressed the nation in New York this morning<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/nov/08/us-election-2016-polls-trump-clinton-live?page=with:block-5822d520e4b0822c310ec431#block-5822d520e4b0822c310ec431\"> adopting a consensual tone and promising \u201cto bind the wounds of division\u201d.</a></p> <p>Two issues are key. What does Trump\u2019s election mean for the economy, and will it plunge America (and the world?) into recession? And what will it mean for security, and Nato? At least one respected commentator has said <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/donald-trump-and-the-end-of-nato/2016/03/04/e8c4b9ca-e146-11e5-8d98-4b3d9215ade1_story.html\">Trump\u2019s victory could mean \u201cthe end of NATO, the end of the European Union and maybe the end of the liberal world order as we know it\u201d.</a></p> <p>May, and everyone else, will also want to know what this means for the UK/US \u2018special relationship\u2019, and for Brexit. Leaving the EU might look less attractive if Britain\u2019s key transatlantic partnership has suddenly become more shaky.</p> <p>But Trump\u2019s election raises all sorts of other questions too. If an outsider roundly dismissed by elite opinion as an unelectable liability can become US president, is it really so wise to assume that Jeremy Corbyn can never become prime minister? Corbyn and Trump are in most respects completely unlike, but Trump\u2019s triumph suggests that insurgency political campaigns founded on the message that neoliberal economics have failed to deliver for ordinary people have even more mileage in them than Kippers or Corbynites would have thought only 12 months ago. The American result will reinforce claims that opinion polls cannot be trusted. And it will also help to justify the assertion that the liberal media is out of touch with what real people think.</p> <p>Our main coverage of the American result is being written up from our New York office.

          "bodyText": "Theresa May has congratulated Donald Trump on his US presidential election victory, as the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and his Lib Dem counterpart, Tim Farron, expressed deep unease at the result. Nicola Sturgeon has urged Donald Trump to prove that he can act for all US citizens regardless of their heritage after his surprise victory in the US presidential elections. David Davis has pledged to share the Westminster government\u2019s \u201clatest thinking\u201d on Brexit with the leaderships of Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, before the first meeting of a forum intended to allow the devolved administrations to help shape Britain\u2019s strategy. Two families who claimed that the bedroom tax, which restricts housing subsidies, was unfair have won their appeals against the UK government at the supreme court. Amnesty International has criticised a UK trade minister for travelling to Qatar to seek contracts for British companies ahead of the 2022 World Cup without apparently highlighting the human rights abuses faced by migrant workers building venues for the event. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. What will or should Donald Trump\u2019s presidency mean for the UK? Here are three good articles that address this. Jeremy Cliffe at the Economist says a Trump presidency will make Brexit harder. A single theme unifies these risks. Brexit is a giant shock to Britain\u2019s place in the world. It will sever old links and require new ones to be forged. As some of its keenest proponents concede, this transition will bring painful costs. Most of all it demands lots of good will and flexibility on all sides. In so far as Mr Trump\u2019s win means a meaner, more fractious, more volatile global order, it raises those costs and shrinks that space for compromise and consensus essential for a smooth Brexit. Limiting the damage of a Trump presidency on a Brexiting Britain demands ambition and perspective from Mrs May. Her approach should be two-sided. First, build a new, closer alliance with Angela Merkel, not just on Brexit but on wider issues: the world economy, security, Russia and China. In Berlin and other European capitals officials complain that June\u2019s referendum result has taken Britain\u2019s mind off all other matters. The prime minister must not allow that to happen and instead work with Mrs Merkel as a bloc capable of countering Mr Trump\u2019s worst traits. Second, Mrs May should use Britain\u2019s influence in America (which is significant, if not as much as Britons like to imagine) to attempt to moderate the new president, staying his hand when he does wrong and indulging his vanity when he does right. Mrs May already had her hands full with Brexit. Now, for Britain\u2019s sake and that of the world, she must also deal with Mr Brexit himself. Will Straw, executive director of Britain Stronger in Europe, at the New Statesman looks at what the left can learn from the Trump and Brexit victories. A new politics is necessary, one with the seeds of dignity. We must find our way to a prosperity which gives people a greater sense of belonging; where communities have more autonomy to judge their own affairs, and where international cooperation is used to tackle the worst excesses of globalisation, including tax avoidance, human trafficking and illegal immigration. So, too, do we need a new language of politics \u2013 one that refuses to pander to prejudice but recognises that what the social psychologist Jonathan Haidt calls the \u201cmoral octaves\u201d which those on the left cannot hear. For example, imagine that there are concentric circles of loyalty \u2013 family, community, country - which are not just a comfort blanket in times of crises, but are hardwired into us as human beings. From this perspective, overt displays of patriotism which may make liberals uncomfortable can in fact be harnessed, and used to reinforce positive values. Larry Summers, an academic and former adviser to Barack Obama, has called it \u201cresponsible nationalism\u201d which \u201cstarts from the idea that the basic responsibility of government is to maximise the welfare of citizens, not to pursue some abstract concept of the global good\u201d. Bill Emmott at CapX asks if the special relationship can survive. We cannot know in advance how protectionist the US is going to become. But we can know that Britain, as a trading nation wanting to buy and sell freely with the whole world, is likely to be a loser if protectionism really does become the flavour of the era. At least the traditionally close relationship between our intelligence services and those of America can still be depended upon. But it is not going to be a comfortable or predictable ride. Theresa May and Boris Johnson had better mean it when they say that post-Brexit Britain will have a great new partnership with our European friends and neighbours. We\u2019re going to need it. Tom Raines, a researcher at Chatham House, the foreign policy thinktank, has posted an interesting thread on Twitter about the implications of Donald Trump\u2019s win for UK foreign policy. He implicitly defends Theresa May\u2019s decision not to express any reservations about Trump today. See point 6. Nigel Farage, the outgoing Ukip leader, is spending the day at a \u201cprivate event\u201d in Barcelona with Alistair Campbell, among others. A Ukip spokesman said Farage would not be speaking to the press in Spain and was due to fly to Miami later in the day. But Farage has issued this statement. Today, the establishment is in deep shock. Even more so than after Brexit. What we are witnessing is the end of a period of big business and big politics controlling our lives. Voters across the Western world want nation state democracy, proper border controls and to be in charge of their own lives. I commend Donald Trump for the courage with which he has fought this campaign and I look forward to a closer relationship between the USA and the UK. We now have a president who likes our country and understands our post-Brexit values. Prepare for further political shocks in the years to come. Conservative MP Andrew Percy, minister for the Northern powerhouse, described Trump\u2019s victory as \u201ca glorious moment for democracy.\u201d Speaking at an event organised by Marketing Lancashire at Burnley football club on Wednesday, Percy was revelling in the US election result, explaining: We\u2019ve just had this massive election and it\u2019s great to see so many people have turned out to vote in what is the greatest democracy in the planet, just to see the enthusiasm with which people have gone to the polls. Alex Salmond, the former Scottish first minister who has had dealings with Donald Trump because his administration approved plans for Trump\u2019s golf course near Aberdeen, told Sky News that he was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d by Trump\u2019s election. He said he hoped being president changed Trump. Trump could be \u201cnice as ninepence\u201d when he was getting his own way, Salmond said. But the electoral campaign showed what he could be like when he was facing opposition. Government departments have form for using big news events, like the US presidential election, as cover for the release of potentially embarrassing information. And today, true to form, departments are releasing information about the ministers\u2019 and special advisers\u2019 meetings, gifts and hospitality. I have not gone through the releases, but I will let you know if anything good crops up. Theresa May, the prime minister, has recorded a clip for the broadcasters about Donald Trump\u2019s election. She essentially just read out, with minor changes, the statement she issued earlier. (See 9.43am.) It was not an interview, but she did take one question on Trump. The reporter asked May if she thought Trump was a fit person to be president, given what he said in the campaign about Muslims and about his plans. And would May be able to work with him? She replied: Yes, I look forward to working with President-elect Trump. The American people have elected him as the next president of the United States. Britain and the United States share values of freedom and democracy and enterprise. And I look forward to building on the special relationship we have between our two countries to ensure the security and prosperity of our two nations in the future. By contrast, when Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, commented on Trump\u2019s election earlier today, she managed to combine an ostensibly friendly message of support with an implicit rebuke to Trump for the stance he took during the campaign on matters like equality, diversity and the rule of law (ie, not torturing people). The contrast is quite striking: Merkel sent out a signal that she would be willing to challenge Trump in defence of some of the key values of European democracy; May didn\u2019t. That doesn\u2019t mean May may doesn\u2019t feel just as strongly about equality etc as Merkel. She most probably does. But she has evidently decided that is not in her or the UK\u2019s interests to go public on these concerns at this stage. That is not particularly surprising, given the obsession successive British governments have had with maintaining close ties with Washington, but May could find that on this she is out of step with public opinion. The North East of Scotland is famous for its parochial newspaper headlines. Most journalists have heard the story about how the Aberdeen Journal covered the sinking of the Titanic under the headline \u201cNorth-east man lost at sea\u201d, even though recent research established that it never used those words and that this is just a journalist myth. Anyway, myth or otherwise, the tradition continues. Here is the lead story on the Buchan Observer website. (I\u2019m grateful to pandapaws BTL for the tip.) This is from Paul Nuttall, favourite in the Ukip leadership contest. In a post on his blog Douglas Carswell, Ukip\u2019s only MP, claims Donald Trump\u2019s policy platform is much more centrist than people think. Carswell, who is much more liberal and pro-immigration than Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, says he thinks Trump could end up persuading Congress to adopt a New Deal-style, big government agenda. Here\u2019s an extract. In his acceptance speech, the President-elect talked about new infrastructure spending, creating new jobs. That idea is reminiscent of the 1930s \u2013 in America, that is. It harks back to FDR\u2019s New Deal. Indeed, throughout the campaign, Trump has drawn policies from both left and right. He has taken protectionism from the Democrats, and a tougher stance on immigration from the Republicans. He has attacked political correctness, but, at the same time, ignored much of the socially conservative culture war. He has pledged to cut taxes, but not to cut welfare. That might explain how Trump has managed to do what no other Republican presidential candidate has done since the 1980s: run the table across the so-called Rust Belt states. The danger is that, having promised change, Trump\u2019s presidency just brings more of the same. Borrowing to fund infrastructure and entitlements will come at a huge long-term cost. Statist stimulus doesn\u2019t usually produce the kind of sustainable economic boom Trump has promised. At least, it didn\u2019t for FDR. Or, for that matter, Obama. But the irony is that, after years of gridlock between the President and Congress, it could be the man Democrats despise more than any other who enables bipartisanship. With Trump in the White House, Republicans in Congress may end up backing a big-government agenda similar to the one they have trenchantly opposed for much of the last eight years. Here is is more reaction to Donald Trump\u2019s victory from Labour figures. From Clive Lewis, the shadow business secretary From Richard Burgon, the shadow justice secretary From Ian Austin MP From Owen Smith, who challenged Jeremy Corbyn for the leadership in the summer From Kevin Brennan MP From Jon Lansman, founder of the pro-Corbyn group Momentum From Brendan Cox, whose MP wife Jo was killed in the summer during the EU referendum From Stella Creasy MP One person with a claim to the title of the British Donald Trump is Nigel Farage (see 11.27am), but another is Lord Sugar, the former Labour peer (he is now independent) who stars in the British version of The Apprentice. The British version was modelled on the American version, which was hosted by Trump. Sugar has been tweeting about his US counterpart. Here is Paddy Ashdown, the former Lib Dem leader, on Donald Trump\u2019s victory. Nigel Farage, the outgoing Ukip leader, is the only senior British politician to have any sort of relationship with Donald Trump. He has spoken at a Trump rally and did little to hide his enthusiasm for the Republican candidate, even though, having criticised President Obama for intervening in the EU referendum, he tried to avoid explicitly endorsing Trump so as not to be accused of hypocrisy. Farage is travelling to Spain today, but is due to head to the US later this week. Here are the tweets he was posting earlier today. Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, says that he is praying Donald Trump gets given \u201cwisdom, insight and grace\u201d. Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Conservative leader, has put out a statement saying she hopes Donald Trump can change. It\u2019s not the result I wanted but we now have to hope that President Trump turns out to be a different man to candidate Trump. Mr Trump tapped into the disaffection we are seeing across the world right now due to economic uncertainty. That\u2019s not something we can ignore. Those of us who believe open, western values are the best way to provide economic security for people now have to redouble our efforts to show they deliver for people. The Conservative MP George Freeman is chair of Theresa May\u2019s policy board. He has set out his thoughts on Donald Trump\u2019s victory in a series of tweets. He says Trump\u2019s election shows Western economies face a \u201cgenuine crisis of legitimacy\u201d. UPDATE: In the comments Ballyboleyman says Freeman is wrong to say that it was low-income voters who put Trump into the White House. He says the demographic breakdown of the exit poll figures, in this very detailed New York Times chart, shows Hillary Clinton ahead amongst low earners. Here is the key table. Carwyn Jones, the Labour first minster of Wales, has urged Donald Trump to \u201crepair a divided nation\u201d. Boris Johnson, the Conservative foreign secretary (and a Brexit supporter during the EU referendum) has congratulated Donald Trump. UPDATE: The Economist\u2019s Jeremy Cliffe points out that Johnson wasn\u2019t always so complimentary about Trump. This is what Johnson said in December last year, after Trump said that there were places in London that were \u201cso radicalised that police are afraid for their own lives\u201d. Johnson was mayor of London at the time. Donald Trump\u2019s ill-informed comments are complete and utter nonsense ... Crime has been falling steadily in both London and New York - and the only reason I wouldn\u2019t go to some parts of New York is the real risk of meeting Donald Trump. Kezia Dugdale, the Labour leader in Scotland, says Trump\u2019s election is \u201ca dark day for those of us who believe in compassion, tolerance and equality\u201d. And this is what she has tweeted. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s SNP first minister, has congratulated Donald Trump on his victory. But, in her statement, she says that she did not want him to win, and that people around the world will feel \u201ca real sense of anxiety\u201d. While this is not the outcome I hoped for, it is the verdict of the American people and we must respect it. I congratulate president-elect Trump on winning the election. We value our relationship with the United States and its people. The ties that bind Scotland and the US - of family, culture and business - are deep and longstanding and they will always endure. It is normal in any election for those on the losing side to be feel disappointment, but today, many in America and across the world, will also feel a real sense of anxiety. I hope the president-elect will take the opportunity to reach out to those who felt marginalized by his campaign and make clear - in deeds as well as words - that he will be a president for everyone in modern, multicultural America. Today must also be a moment for those who share progressive values - all of us who believe in tolerance and diversity - to speak up loudly and clearly for the values we hold dear. I also want to pay tribute to Hillary Clinton. While I am personally disappointed that she will not be America\u2019s first woman president, her candidacy represented a major step forward for women in America and across the world - for that, as well as for her many years of public service, she is owed a deep debt of gratitude. The Green party has sent out an email with the headline: \u201cCaroline Lucas responds to racist being elected US president\u201d. But in her statement Lucas, the Green\u2019s co-leader, does not actually use the word racist. She says: This is a devastating day for women, for people of colour, for disabled people and for an inclusive society in the USA. Trump\u2019s election is also a hammer blow for the fight against climate change \u2013 and presents a genuine threat to some of the poorest people in the world who will suffer its effects worse. But this is no time to mourn \u2013 instead we must organize like never before to keep our communities cohesive and our climate safe. On this dark day we extend the hand of friendship to people in the USA who wake up in fear \u2013 we know that you are not defined by the hatred espoused by your new president. But it\u2019s at times like this when we need to unite, learn, resist and hope more than ever before. Today, in whatever ways we can, let\u2019s light a candle rather than curse the darkness. Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, has issued a statement about the US result. He says that many people will be \u201cshocked\u201d by Donald Trump\u2019s election, but that it shows that for many people the economic status quo isn\u2019t working. Here is the statement in full. Many in Britain and elsewhere will be understandably shocked by Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the US presidential election, the rhetoric around it and what the election result means for the rest of the world, as well as America. Trump\u2019s election is an unmistakable rejection of a political establishment and an economic system that simply isn\u2019t working for most people. It is one that has delivered escalating inequality and stagnating or falling living standards for the majority, both in the US and Britain. This is a rejection of a failed economic consensus and a governing elite that has been seen not to have listened. And the public anger that has propelled Donald Trump to office has been reflected in political upheavals across the world. But some of Trump\u2019s answers to the big questions facing America, and the divisive rhetoric around them, are clearly wrong. I have no doubt, however, that the decency and common sense of the American people will prevail, and we send our solidarity to a nation of migrants, innovators and democrats. After this latest global wake up call, the need for a real alternative to a failed economic and political system could not be clearer. That alternative must be based on working together, social justice and economic renewal, rather than sowing fear and division. And the solutions we offer have to improve the lives of everyone, not pit one group of people against another. Americans have made their choice. The urgent necessity is now for us all to work across continents to tackle our common global challenges: to secure peace, take action on climate change and deliver economic prosperity and justice. Here is our business live blog, covering reaction to Donald Trump\u2019s victory on the markets. The FTSE 100 has recovered after an early slump. Leanne Wood, the leader of the Welsh nationalist party Plaid Cymru, said in a statement that Donald Trump must now withdraw some of the \u201cappalling\u201d things he said during the campaign. Now is the time for calm heads and winding down the rhetoric we have witnessed during the election. If Trump wants to do business with the rest of the world, he must row back on the appalling comments we saw throughout the campaign. There is now a clear trend in Western democracies of anti-establishment rhetoric being falsely utilised by the wealthy and powerful as a route to power. She also said that there was a parallel between Trump winning and people voting for Brexit in Wales. Many people have been genuinely left behind or estranged by the economy and by politics. In both the United States and Wales, some of the areas which voted most strongly for Trump or for Brexit are those which lack the most opportunities. The temptation now is for centre-left, socialist or progressive parties to write those people off. But we must not do so. While our values of anti-racism and anti-sexism are not up for negotiation, we must still reach out to those people who are now attracted to right-wing populist parties or causes, because on issues like inequality of wealth, there is a clear case to answer. Northern Ireland\u2019s first minister, the DUP\u2019s Arlene Foster, and her deputy first minister, Sinn Fein\u2019s Martin McGuinness, have both congratulated Donald Trump. Foster said: I congratulate Donald Trump on his historic election as the 45th President of the United States of America. We are a small region but we are fortunate to have strong historical, economic and political ties to the United States. Northern Ireland has developed a mutually beneficial relationship with the United States and I look forward to working with Donald Trump\u2019s administration to continue this. As our largest inward investor the United States plays a massive role in our economic progress. And McGuinness said: I congratulate Donald Trump on his election victory. I will work constructively with President Trump to maintain and strengthen our well established and deeply valued relationship with the United States. Over many years successive US administrations have made a major contribution to both our peace process and economic development and I expect this to continue. I commiserate with Hillary Clinton who showed unwavering commitment to the north of Ireland as secretary of state and first lady. Tim Farron, the Lib Dem leader, has issued a statement about the election of Donald Trump. Farron says never in his lifetime have liberal values been so under threat. Here is the statement in full. Liberal values of moderation, freedom, respect for the rule of law, openness and concern for one another can no longer be taken for granted. In the United States last night, those values were defeated. But those values are vital if we are to live together in peace, prosperity and freedom. Those of us who care passionately for those liberal values need to fight for them, to win the arguments, to inspire new generations to the great and historic cause of liberalism. Never in my lifetime have those liberal values been so under threat, and never have they been more relevant and necessary. There is nothing inevitable about the rise of nationalism, protectionism and division, Justin Trudeau proves that. I am determined that together, we must make it our mission to build that liberal cause. The alternatives are unthinkable. Normally on a Wednesday we get PMQs, but the House of Commons is having a mini recess at the moment and so we won\u2019t get Theresa May or Jeremy Corbyn at the despatch box today. Here is the full statement from Theresa May, the prime minister, issued by Number 10 Downing Street. I would like to congratulate Donald Trump on being elected the next President of the United States, following a hard-fought campaign. Britain and the United States have an enduring and special relationship based on the values of freedom, democracy and enterprise. We are, and will remain, strong and close partners on trade, security and defence. I look forward to working with President-elect Donald Trump, building on these ties to ensure the security and prosperity of our nations in the years ahead. The Press Association has just snapped this. Prime Minister Theresa May has congratulated Donald Trump and said Britain and the US \u201cwill remain strong and close partners\u201d. In retrospect it is probably a good thing that, when MPs debated a proposal to ban Donald Trump from the UK in January this year, they did not end up voting to keep out the man who has just been elected president of the United States. It is worth reading the debate again (I covered it at length on the live blog here) to be reminded just what a shock to conventional politics today\u2019s result is. It will have a profound impact on Britain, perhaps - if it signals a long-term shift in the character of Western democracy - even as great as Brexit. Today I will be focusing on the UK political reaction. There has been little so far, because ministers and MPs are still trying to make sense of the result. Downing Street and the British foreign policy establishment have very few links with Trump and his campaign and Theresa May and her advisers will be trying to work out whether the next American president is the provocative, trigger-happy narcissist who campaigned for the job or the man who addressed the nation in New York this morning adopting a consensual tone and promising \u201cto bind the wounds of division\u201d. Two issues are key. What does Trump\u2019s election mean for the economy, and will it plunge America (and the world?) into recession? And what will it mean for security, and Nato? At least one respected commentator has said Trump\u2019s victory could mean \u201cthe end of NATO, the end of the European Union and maybe the end of the liberal world order as we know it\u201d. May, and everyone else, will also want to know what this means for the UK/US \u2018special relationship\u2019, and for Brexit. Leaving the EU might look less attractive if Britain\u2019s key transatlantic partnership has suddenly become more shaky. But Trump\u2019s election raises all sorts of other questions too. If an outsider roundly dismissed by elite opinion as an unelectable liability can become US president, is it really so wise to assume that Jeremy Corbyn can never become prime minister? Corbyn and Trump are in most respects completely unlike, but Trump\u2019s triumph suggests that insurgency political campaigns founded on the message that neoliberal economics have failed to deliver for ordinary people have even more mileage in them than Kippers or Corbynites would have thought only 12 months ago. The American result will reinforce claims that opinion polls cannot be trusted. And it will also help to justify the assertion that the liberal media is out of touch with what real people think. Our main coverage of the American result is being written up from our New York office. You can read our US election live blog here. I don\u2019t think there is going to be much other UK politics today but, if there is, I will give it a mention too. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but normally I find it impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer direct questions, although sometimes I miss them or don\u2019t have time. Alternatively you could post a question to me on Twitter.",

It is economic relations and the preservation of the planet.\u201d<br></p> <p>Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said European politicians should heed the message from Trump votes. \u201cThere is a part of our electorate that feels \u2026abandoned\u201d, including people who feel \u201cleft behind by globalisation,\u201d he said.</p> <h2><strong>Germany</strong></h2> <p>Chancellor Angela Merkel said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There\u2019s no country outside the European Union we Germans have as close a relationship with as the United States of America. Whoever rules this vast country, with its enormous economic strength, its military potential, its cultural influence, carries a responsibility which is felt all over the world.</p> <p> Americans have decided that the person to carry this responsibility for the next four years is Donald Trump. Germany and America are connected by common values: democracy, freedom, respect for the law and for human dignity irrespective of origin, skin colour, religion, gender, sexual orientation or political conviction. On the basis of these values, I offer the future president of America, Donald Trump, a close working relationship. </p> <p>Partnership with the USA remains a basic pillar of German foreign policy in order for us to meet the great challenges of our time: striving for economic and social wellbeing and a forward-looking climate policy, the fight against terrorism, hunger and disease, engagement for peace and freedom, in Germany, Europe and all over the world.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>The German foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I believe the biggest challenge will be to meet the high expectations that Trump himself has created: to make America great again, also with a view to the economy, to create new jobs in the current economic environment, all that won\u2019t be easy. Above all I hope that we aren\u2019t facing bigger tectonic shifts in international politics. </p> <p>During his campaign Donald Trump has spoken critically not just about Europe, but particularly about Germany. I think we have to prepare for the fact that American foreign policy will be less predictable for us in the future. We have to be prepared for the fact [...] that America will be more inclined to make unilateral decisions in the future.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>The German defence minister, Ursula von der Leyen, said the results were a \u201chuge shock\u201d. She told broadcaster ARD: \u201cI think Trump knows that this was not a vote for him but rather against Washington, against the establishment.\u201d</p> <h2>Italy</h2> <p>Italy\u2019s prime minister, Matteo Renzi, who was a vocal supporter of Hillary Clinton even before she secured the Democratic nomination, offered his congratulations to Trump \u201cin the name of Italy\u201d and said he was convinced that the friendship between Italy and the US was strong and solid.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a new political fact that along with other things demonstrates that we are in a new stage,\u201d Renzi said. \u201cWho would say that Trump would win? It is that way and we respect it, we will cooperate with the new American president and have a relationship between the EU and Italy.\u201d</p> <p>Pope Francis did not mention the US elections during his Wednesday audience, but secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, offered Trump congratulations in a statement to Vatican Radio that \u201chis government can be truly fruitful\u201d.<br></p> <p>He added the Vatican offered its prayers \u201cthat the Lord illuminates and sustains him in service of his country, naturally, but also in service of the well-being and peace of the world\u201d. Parolin concluded by noting that \u201cthere is need for everyone to work to change the global situation, which is in a situation of severe lacerations and great conflict.\u201d</p> <h2>Slovenia</h2> <p>Boris Pahor, the president of the Alpine nation that is the home country of Melania Trump, said: \u201cWe are allied as part of Nato and I will strive for the friendship and the alliance to deepen further.\u201d</p> <h2>Spain</h2> <p>The prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, congratulated the new president on his victory and vowed to work with him to strengthen Spain\u2019s relationship with an \u201cindispensable ally\u201d.</p> <p>Spain\u2019s foreign ministry said it was confident that the new era of bilateral relations would serve to \u201creinforce and consolidate\u201d Spain\u2019s partnership with the US and \u201cdeepen the friendship between our countries and peoples\u201d.</p> <p>But Pablo Iglesias, leader of the anti-austerity Podemos party was less welcoming. Above a picture of the famous black power salute at the 1968 Olympics and an emoji of a clenched fist, he tweeted: \u201cThe vaccine against Trump\u2019s fascism is social justice and human rights, not more establishment. There are people in the US who will resist.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Sweden</strong></h2> <p>Sweden\u2019s former prime minister Carl Bildt said 2016 was the year of \u201cdouble disaster\u201d for the west. He tweeted: \u201cAt least Richard Nixon had a solid understanding of world affairs. Manoeuvred skilfully. But morally corrupt. And collapsed in disgrace.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Russia</strong></h2> <p>Vladimir <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/09/putin-applauds-trump-win-and-hails-new-era-of-positive-ties-with-us\">Putin sent Trump a telegram</a> to congratulate him. Speaking at a ceremony in the Kremlin, the Russian president said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We heard the campaign slogans when he was still a candidate which were aimed at restoring relations between Russia and the United States.</p> <p>We understand that it will not be an easy path given the current state of degradation in the relations. And as I have repeatedly said, it\u2019s not our fault that Russian-American relations are in such a poor state. But Russia wants and is ready to restore full-fledged relations with the United States.</p> <p>I repeat we understand that this will be difficult, but we are ready to play our part, and do everything to return Russian-American relations to stable and sustainable development track. This would serve the interests of both the Russian and American peoples, and would have a positive effect on the general climate of global affairs given the special responsibility of Russia and the US to sustain global security.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Garry Kasparov, former world champion turned vocal opponent of Putin, tweeted simply: \u201cWinter is here.\u201d</p> <p>At a morning reception his residence in Moscow held as Trump edged ever closer to the White House, US ambassador to Russia John Tefft reminded visitors that diplomats are unable to give personal opinions on elections. He added: \u201cWhether you\u2019re happy or not, one of the key things here is to understand that our institutions in America will continue.\u201d<br></p> <p>Privately, however, many US diplomats in the country will be wondering whether a President Trump means a total reversal on Russia policy. Tefft\u2019s predecessor in the role, Michael McFaul, wrote on Twitter: \u201cPutin intervened in our elections and succeeded.\u201d</p> <h2>Ukraine</h2> <p>Officials expressed fear prior to the vote that a Trump presidency could see Ukraine thrown under the bus in favour of improved ties with Russia. </p> <p>In a statement, President Petro Poroshenko offered \u201csincere congratulations to Donald Trump on being elected president of the United States and to the friendly American nation on democratic expression of will\u201d. </p> <p>Poroshenko said he had met the US ambassador on Wednesday and been assured that \u201cthe new US administration would remain a reliable partner in the struggle for democracy\u201d.</p> <h2>Czech Republic</h2> <p>President Milo\u0161 Zeman declared he was \u201cvery happy\u201d with Trump\u2019s election victory, saying he cut through political correctness and addressed key issues like migration. </p> <p>Zeman, who endorsed Trump in September, said: \u201cI would like to cordially congratulate Donald Trump. I had, as one of few European politicians, declared public support for this candidate \u2026 because I agree with his opinions on migration as well as the fight against Islamic terrorism.</p> <p>\u201cI appreciate Donald Trump\u2019s public demeanour, he speaks clearly, sometimes roughly, but understandably, and avoids what is sometimes called political correctness.\u201d</p> <h2>Middle East</h2> <h2><strong>Egypt</strong></h2> <p>President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi said Cairo wanted to see more \u201ccooperation and coordination\u201d between the two nations to bolster stability and peace in the Middle East. He telephoned Trump to offer his congratulations and invited him to visit Egypt.</p> <h2><strong>Israel</strong></h2> <p>Prime Minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/09/israel-donald-trump-netanyahu-jerusalem\">Benjamin Netanyahu</a> congratulated Trump and called him a \u201ctrue friend of the State of Israel\u201d. Netanyahu said that he believes the two leaders \u201cwill continue to strengthen the unique alliance between our two countries and bring it to ever greater heights\u201d.</p> <p>The news was met with jubilation by politicians on the Israeli right, including the country\u2019s education minister Naftali Bennett, who declared that Trump\u2019s victory meant \u201cthe era of a Palestinian state is over\u201d.</p> <p> \u201cTrump\u2019s victory is an opportunity for Israel to immediately retract the notion of a Palestinian state in the centre of the country, which would hurt our security and just cause. This is the position of the president-elect, as written in his platform, and it should be our policy, plain and simple.\u201d</p> <p>Trump is popular among the Israeli rightwing not least for having said that one of his first acts would be to reverse years of American government policy and move the US embassy to Jerusalem. </p> <p>Commenting explicitly on that promise, Jerusalem\u2019s mayor Nir Barkat congratulated Trump as a \u201cdevoted supporter of Jerusalem\u201d, adding that he expected the Trump to move the US embassy to the capital. \u201cI am full of hope for your support for our activities for building in and developing Jerusalem for all her residents, and I invite you to visit the capital of Israel.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Palestine</strong></h2> <p>The news of Trump\u2019s election was greeted cautiously by Palestinian figures. A spokesman for the Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbassaid: \u201cWe will deal with any president elected by the American people on the principle of achieving permanent peace in the Middle East based on the two state solution on June 4 1967 lines with east Jerusalem as its capital.\u201d</p> <h2>Saudi Arabia</h2> <p>King Salman expressed hope that Trump would bring stability to the Middle East. \u201cWe wish your excellency success in your mission to achieve security and stability in the Middle East and worldwide,\u201d he said, praising US-Saudi relations, which are \u201chistoric and tight between the two friendly countries, that all parties aspire to develop and reinforce\u201d. </p> <h2>Turkey</h2> <p>In a statement, President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan said: <br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The election marks the beginning of a new era in the United States. I hope that the American people\u2019s decision will facilitate audacious steps being taken regarding fundamental rights and liberties and democracy in the world and regional developments. Personally and on behalf of the nation, I wish to consider this decision by the American people a positive sign and wish them a successful future.\u201d </p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>Iran</strong></h2> <p>President Hassan Rouhani reacted to Trump\u2019s win by saying that it would not change the trajectory of his country\u2019s foreign policy: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The US election results will have no impact on the policies of the Islamic Republic. Because of wrong policies, the position of America in the international community and world\u2019s public opinion has diminished and [the US\u2019s] growing rift with Europe and the world will exacerbate that position.\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p>The foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said the US had to continue respecting last year\u2019s landmark nuclear agreement. \u201cAmerica has to implement the international obligation it accepted under the nuclear deal.\u201d </p> <h2>Iraq</h2> <p>Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi congratulated Trump and said he was looking forward to continued support in his country\u2019s fight against Islamic State. In a statement on his website, Abadi said he hopes the \u201cworld and the United States will continue to support Iraq in fighting terrorism\u201d. </p> <h2>Americas</h2> <h2><strong>Mexico</strong><br></h2> <p>President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto said he was ready to work with Trump to help bilateral relations, and that the two countries would continue to tighten bonds of cooperation and mutual respect. </p> <p>Pe\u00f1a Nieto was heavily criticised for receiving Trump in Mexico during the campaign, after the Republican candidate called Mexican immigrants rapists and vowed to build a wall between the two countries. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/nov/09/mexico-president-congratulates-trump-during-friendly-conversation-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5b6yq\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2878685\"            data-video-name=\"Mexico president congratulates Trump during 'friendly conversation' \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5823ab60e4b0eda0192fe007\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/11/09/161109mexico_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/11/09/161109mexico.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/11/09/161109mexico_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/nov/09/mexico-president-congratulates-trump-during-friendly-conversation-video\">Mexico president congratulates Trump during \u2018friendly conversation\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cMexico and the United States are friends, partners and allies and we should keep collaborating for the competitiveness and development of North America,\u201d Pe\u00f1a Nieto said on his Twitter account. </p> <p>Mexico\u2019s former presidential candidate Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador called for calm. In a video on Facebook he said Mexico was \u201ca free, independent, sovereign country\u201d. \u201cIt is not a colony, it is not a protectorate, it does not depend on any foreign government.\u201d<br></p> <h2>Canada</h2> <p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau congratulated Trump and stressed the close friendship and ties between the two nations. The US accounted for 60% of Canada\u2019s global trade in 2014, a relationship underpinned by Nafta. </p> <p>Trump, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/29/obama-trudeau-pena-nieto-ottawa-trump-brexit\">who has described the agreement as \u201cthe worst trade deal in history\u201d</a>, has vowed to renegotiate the terms and would move to withdraw the US from the deal if Canada and Mexico refuse.

We look forward to working very closely with President-elect Trump, his administration, and with the United States Congress in the years ahead, including on issues such as trade, investment, and international peace and security.</p> <p>The relationship between our two countries serves as a model for the world. Our shared values, deep cultural ties, and strong integrated economies will continue to provide the basis for advancing our strong and prosperous partnership.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <h2>Asia</h2> <h2><strong>Cambodia</strong></h2> <p>The country\u2019s long-serving, authoritarian prime minister Hun Sen congratulated Trump. On his official Facebook page, Hun Sen pointed out that he had announced his support for the Republican candidate several days earlier. \u201cAmerican voters have shown their choice to elect your excellency,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMy support for your candidacy is not wrong either.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>China</strong></h2> <p>Chinese state media said President Xi Jinping had called Trump to congratulate him on his victory. </p> <p>\u201cI place great importance on the China-US relationship, and look forward to working with you to uphold the principles of non-conflict, non-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation,\u201d Xi was reported to have told Trump.

          "bodyText": "European Union Top officials at the European Union have invited Donald Trump to Europe for an urgent US-EU summit In a joint letter, Donald Tusk, president of the European council and Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European commission, congratulated Trump and urged him to come to Europe for talks \u201cat your earliest convenience\u201d. Tusk and Juncker are seeking reassurance on key issues on which Trump\u2019s remarks on the campaign trial have rattled European leaders, including migration, climate change and Russia\u2019s threat to Ukraine. The letter said: \u201cIt is more important than ever to strengthen transatlantic relations. Only by cooperating closely can the EU and the US continue to make a difference when dealing with unprecedented challenges such as Da\u2019esh [Isis], the threats to Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity, climate change and migration.\u201d It added: \u201cWe would take this opportunity to invite you to visit Europe for an EU \u2013 US summit at your earliest convenience. This conversation would allow for us to chart the course of our relations for the next four years.\u201d Tusk made clear that Trump\u2019s victory heightened uncertainty about transatlantic relations, and called for Europe to get its act together and restore confidence. \u201cThe events of the last months and days should be treated as a warning sign for all who believe in liberal democracy,\u201d he said, adding that no country could be great in isolation. \u201cAmerica and Europe can, should and will work together\u201d, he added, but this would require \u201cmajor efforts from both sides\u201d. The EU\u2019s foreign affairs chief, Federica Mogherini, gave a diplomatic reaction to Trump\u2019s victory, tweeting: \u201cEU-US ties are deeper than any change in politics.\u201d Martin Schulz, the president of the European parliament, said the vote was \u201ca protest vote\u201d similar to Brexit. \u201cIt began timidly, but this is like a wave, a wave of protest that will lead to Trump in the White House,\u201d Schulz told Europe 1 radio. Nato The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said he was looking forward to working with Trump and that US leadership was vital to the world\u2019s biggest military alliance. \u201cIt is important that the transatlantic bond remains strong\u201d, he said, adding that \u201cUS leadership is as important as ever\u201d. Stoltenberg said he was looking forward to welcoming Trump at next spring\u2019s Nato summit, to be held in the alliance\u2019s new premises in Brussels. Europe UK Theresa May congratulated Trump on his victory in a hard-fought campaign, saying Britain and the US have \u201can enduring and special relationship based on the values of freedom, democracy and enterprise\u201d. She added: \u201cWe are, and will remain, strong and close partners on trade, security and defence. I look forward to working with president-elect Donald Trump, building on these ties to ensure the security and prosperity of our nations in the years ahead.\u201d Number 10 policymakers are already viewing the result through the same prism as Brexit. The head of the No 10 policy board, George Freeman, tweeted: \u201cat its heart this is about a broken contract through the failure of globalised market economics to serve the interests of domestic workers.\u201d He said the result was \u201ca stunning demonstration of how disempowered low income Americans feel by Washington politics and globalisation\u201d. \u201cThe insurgency is a big test for the constitutional protections for liberty and democracy in the UK and the US. It is clear we are living through a genuine crisis of legitimacy sweeping through western political economy\u201d. He asked whether the EU leaders will wake up to \u201cthe roar of anger at globalisation, machine politics, and out of touch elites\u201d. Freeman, who was a fierce critic of the tone of Trump\u2019s campaign and at one point described him as Trumpolini, added: \u201cthe key now is how he governs, and who he appoints to his administration\u201d. Nicola Sturgeon urged Trump to prove that he can act for all US citizens regardless of their heritage. The Scottish first minister said many US voters and others around the world would feel \u201ca real sense of anxiety\u201d at his victory, adding: \u201cI hope the president-elect will take the opportunity to reach out to those who felt marginalised by his campaign and make clear - in deeds as well as words - that he will be a president for everyone in modern, multicultural America.\u201d \u201cToday must also be a moment for those who share progressive values - all of us who believe in tolerance and diversity - to speak up loudly and clearly for the values we hold dear.\u201d France French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande said Trump\u2019s win \u201copens up a period of uncertainty\u201d that \u201cmust be faced with lucidity and clarity\u201d. Hollande congratulated Trump \u201cas is natural between two heads of state\u201d, but showed little enthusiasm. Hollande had openly endorsed Clinton. \u201cCertain positions taken by Donald Trump during the American campaign must be confronted with the values and interests we share with the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is at stake is peace, the fight against terrorism, the situation in the Middle East. It is economic relations and the preservation of the planet.\u201d Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said European politicians should heed the message from Trump votes. \u201cThere is a part of our electorate that feels \u2026abandoned\u201d, including people who feel \u201cleft behind by globalisation,\u201d he said. Germany Chancellor Angela Merkel said: There\u2019s no country outside the European Union we Germans have as close a relationship with as the United States of America. Whoever rules this vast country, with its enormous economic strength, its military potential, its cultural influence, carries a responsibility which is felt all over the world. Americans have decided that the person to carry this responsibility for the next four years is Donald Trump. Germany and America are connected by common values: democracy, freedom, respect for the law and for human dignity irrespective of origin, skin colour, religion, gender, sexual orientation or political conviction. On the basis of these values, I offer the future president of America, Donald Trump, a close working relationship. Partnership with the USA remains a basic pillar of German foreign policy in order for us to meet the great challenges of our time: striving for economic and social wellbeing and a forward-looking climate policy, the fight against terrorism, hunger and disease, engagement for peace and freedom, in Germany, Europe and all over the world.\u201d The German foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, said: I believe the biggest challenge will be to meet the high expectations that Trump himself has created: to make America great again, also with a view to the economy, to create new jobs in the current economic environment, all that won\u2019t be easy. Above all I hope that we aren\u2019t facing bigger tectonic shifts in international politics. During his campaign Donald Trump has spoken critically not just about Europe, but particularly about Germany. I think we have to prepare for the fact that American foreign policy will be less predictable for us in the future. We have to be prepared for the fact [...] that America will be more inclined to make unilateral decisions in the future.\u201d The German defence minister, Ursula von der Leyen, said the results were a \u201chuge shock\u201d. She told broadcaster ARD: \u201cI think Trump knows that this was not a vote for him but rather against Washington, against the establishment.\u201d Italy Italy\u2019s prime minister, Matteo Renzi, who was a vocal supporter of Hillary Clinton even before she secured the Democratic nomination, offered his congratulations to Trump \u201cin the name of Italy\u201d and said he was convinced that the friendship between Italy and the US was strong and solid. \u201cIt\u2019s a new political fact that along with other things demonstrates that we are in a new stage,\u201d Renzi said. \u201cWho would say that Trump would win? It is that way and we respect it, we will cooperate with the new American president and have a relationship between the EU and Italy.\u201d Pope Francis did not mention the US elections during his Wednesday audience, but secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, offered Trump congratulations in a statement to Vatican Radio that \u201chis government can be truly fruitful\u201d. He added the Vatican offered its prayers \u201cthat the Lord illuminates and sustains him in service of his country, naturally, but also in service of the well-being and peace of the world\u201d. Parolin concluded by noting that \u201cthere is need for everyone to work to change the global situation, which is in a situation of severe lacerations and great conflict.\u201d Slovenia Boris Pahor, the president of the Alpine nation that is the home country of Melania Trump, said: \u201cWe are allied as part of Nato and I will strive for the friendship and the alliance to deepen further.\u201d Spain The prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, congratulated the new president on his victory and vowed to work with him to strengthen Spain\u2019s relationship with an \u201cindispensable ally\u201d. Spain\u2019s foreign ministry said it was confident that the new era of bilateral relations would serve to \u201creinforce and consolidate\u201d Spain\u2019s partnership with the US and \u201cdeepen the friendship between our countries and peoples\u201d. But Pablo Iglesias, leader of the anti-austerity Podemos party was less welcoming. Above a picture of the famous black power salute at the 1968 Olympics and an emoji of a clenched fist, he tweeted: \u201cThe vaccine against Trump\u2019s fascism is social justice and human rights, not more establishment. There are people in the US who will resist.\u201d Sweden Sweden\u2019s former prime minister Carl Bildt said 2016 was the year of \u201cdouble disaster\u201d for the west. He tweeted: \u201cAt least Richard Nixon had a solid understanding of world affairs. Manoeuvred skilfully. But morally corrupt. And collapsed in disgrace.\u201d Russia Vladimir Putin sent Trump a telegram to congratulate him. Speaking at a ceremony in the Kremlin, the Russian president said: We heard the campaign slogans when he was still a candidate which were aimed at restoring relations between Russia and the United States. We understand that it will not be an easy path given the current state of degradation in the relations. And as I have repeatedly said, it\u2019s not our fault that Russian-American relations are in such a poor state. But Russia wants and is ready to restore full-fledged relations with the United States. I repeat we understand that this will be difficult, but we are ready to play our part, and do everything to return Russian-American relations to stable and sustainable development track. This would serve the interests of both the Russian and American peoples, and would have a positive effect on the general climate of global affairs given the special responsibility of Russia and the US to sustain global security.\u201d Garry Kasparov, former world champion turned vocal opponent of Putin, tweeted simply: \u201cWinter is here.\u201d At a morning reception his residence in Moscow held as Trump edged ever closer to the White House, US ambassador to Russia John Tefft reminded visitors that diplomats are unable to give personal opinions on elections. He added: \u201cWhether you\u2019re happy or not, one of the key things here is to understand that our institutions in America will continue.\u201d Privately, however, many US diplomats in the country will be wondering whether a President Trump means a total reversal on Russia policy. Tefft\u2019s predecessor in the role, Michael McFaul, wrote on Twitter: \u201cPutin intervened in our elections and succeeded.\u201d Ukraine Officials expressed fear prior to the vote that a Trump presidency could see Ukraine thrown under the bus in favour of improved ties with Russia. In a statement, President Petro Poroshenko offered \u201csincere congratulations to Donald Trump on being elected president of the United States and to the friendly American nation on democratic expression of will\u201d. Poroshenko said he had met the US ambassador on Wednesday and been assured that \u201cthe new US administration would remain a reliable partner in the struggle for democracy\u201d. Czech Republic President Milo\u0161 Zeman declared he was \u201cvery happy\u201d with Trump\u2019s election victory, saying he cut through political correctness and addressed key issues like migration. Zeman, who endorsed Trump in September, said: \u201cI would like to cordially congratulate Donald Trump. I had, as one of few European politicians, declared public support for this candidate \u2026 because I agree with his opinions on migration as well as the fight against Islamic terrorism. \u201cI appreciate Donald Trump\u2019s public demeanour, he speaks clearly, sometimes roughly, but understandably, and avoids what is sometimes called political correctness.\u201d Middle East Egypt President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi said Cairo wanted to see more \u201ccooperation and coordination\u201d between the two nations to bolster stability and peace in the Middle East. He telephoned Trump to offer his congratulations and invited him to visit Egypt. Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu congratulated Trump and called him a \u201ctrue friend of the State of Israel\u201d. Netanyahu said that he believes the two leaders \u201cwill continue to strengthen the unique alliance between our two countries and bring it to ever greater heights\u201d. The news was met with jubilation by politicians on the Israeli right, including the country\u2019s education minister Naftali Bennett, who declared that Trump\u2019s victory meant \u201cthe era of a Palestinian state is over\u201d. \u201cTrump\u2019s victory is an opportunity for Israel to immediately retract the notion of a Palestinian state in the centre of the country, which would hurt our security and just cause. This is the position of the president-elect, as written in his platform, and it should be our policy, plain and simple.\u201d Trump is popular among the Israeli rightwing not least for having said that one of his first acts would be to reverse years of American government policy and move the US embassy to Jerusalem. Commenting explicitly on that promise, Jerusalem\u2019s mayor Nir Barkat congratulated Trump as a \u201cdevoted supporter of Jerusalem\u201d, adding that he expected the Trump to move the US embassy to the capital. \u201cI am full of hope for your support for our activities for building in and developing Jerusalem for all her residents, and I invite you to visit the capital of Israel.\u201d Palestine The news of Trump\u2019s election was greeted cautiously by Palestinian figures. A spokesman for the Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbassaid: \u201cWe will deal with any president elected by the American people on the principle of achieving permanent peace in the Middle East based on the two state solution on June 4 1967 lines with east Jerusalem as its capital.\u201d Saudi Arabia King Salman expressed hope that Trump would bring stability to the Middle East. \u201cWe wish your excellency success in your mission to achieve security and stability in the Middle East and worldwide,\u201d he said, praising US-Saudi relations, which are \u201chistoric and tight between the two friendly countries, that all parties aspire to develop and reinforce\u201d. Turkey In a statement, President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan said: The election marks the beginning of a new era in the United States. I hope that the American people\u2019s decision will facilitate audacious steps being taken regarding fundamental rights and liberties and democracy in the world and regional developments. Personally and on behalf of the nation, I wish to consider this decision by the American people a positive sign and wish them a successful future.\u201d Iran President Hassan Rouhani reacted to Trump\u2019s win by saying that it would not change the trajectory of his country\u2019s foreign policy: The US election results will have no impact on the policies of the Islamic Republic. Because of wrong policies, the position of America in the international community and world\u2019s public opinion has diminished and [the US\u2019s] growing rift with Europe and the world will exacerbate that position.\u201d The foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said the US had to continue respecting last year\u2019s landmark nuclear agreement. \u201cAmerica has to implement the international obligation it accepted under the nuclear deal.\u201d Iraq Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi congratulated Trump and said he was looking forward to continued support in his country\u2019s fight against Islamic State. In a statement on his website, Abadi said he hopes the \u201cworld and the United States will continue to support Iraq in fighting terrorism\u201d. Americas Mexico President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto said he was ready to work with Trump to help bilateral relations, and that the two countries would continue to tighten bonds of cooperation and mutual respect. Pe\u00f1a Nieto was heavily criticised for receiving Trump in Mexico during the campaign, after the Republican candidate called Mexican immigrants rapists and vowed to build a wall between the two countries. \u201cMexico and the United States are friends, partners and allies and we should keep collaborating for the competitiveness and development of North America,\u201d Pe\u00f1a Nieto said on his Twitter account. Mexico\u2019s former presidential candidate Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador called for calm. In a video on Facebook he said Mexico was \u201ca free, independent, sovereign country\u201d. \u201cIt is not a colony, it is not a protectorate, it does not depend on any foreign government.\u201d Canada Prime Minister Justin Trudeau congratulated Trump and stressed the close friendship and ties between the two nations. The US accounted for 60% of Canada\u2019s global trade in 2014, a relationship underpinned by Nafta. Trump, who has described the agreement as \u201cthe worst trade deal in history\u201d, has vowed to renegotiate the terms and would move to withdraw the US from the deal if Canada and Mexico refuse. According to the Canadian government, nearly 400,000 people a day cross the shared border between Canada and the US. Trudeau\u2019s statement said: On behalf of the Government of Canada, I would like to congratulate Donald J Trump on his election as the next President of the United States. Canada has no closer friend, partner, and ally than the United States. We look forward to working very closely with President-elect Trump, his administration, and with the United States Congress in the years ahead, including on issues such as trade, investment, and international peace and security. The relationship between our two countries serves as a model for the world. Our shared values, deep cultural ties, and strong integrated economies will continue to provide the basis for advancing our strong and prosperous partnership.\u201d Asia Cambodia The country\u2019s long-serving, authoritarian prime minister Hun Sen congratulated Trump. On his official Facebook page, Hun Sen pointed out that he had announced his support for the Republican candidate several days earlier. \u201cAmerican voters have shown their choice to elect your excellency,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMy support for your candidacy is not wrong either.\u201d China Chinese state media said President Xi Jinping had called Trump to congratulate him on his victory. \u201cI place great importance on the China-US relationship, and look forward to working with you to uphold the principles of non-conflict, non-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation,\u201d Xi was reported to have told Trump. Xi also told Trump he hoped the two sides could avoid \u201cconflict and confrontation [and] instead achieve cooperation and a win-win [relationship]\u201d. A spokesperson for China\u2019s foreign ministry said Beijing was looking forward to working with the new administration. \u201cWe will work with the new US president to ensure the steady and sound development of bilateral relations so as to benefit the people in both countries as well as around the world,\u201d Lu Kang told reporters at a regular press briefing in the Chinese capital. Lu said any future disputes over trade could be settled \u201cin a responsible manner\u201d and hinted at Chinese concerns over the possibility that Trump might introduce protectionist measures. \u201cI would like to say that China and US trade cooperation has benefited the US people rather than hurting their interests,\u201d he said. The state-run Xinhua news agency said the campaign highlighted that \u201cthe majority of Americans are rebelling against the US\u2019s political class and financial elites\u201d. The official Communist party newspaper People\u2019s Daily said the presidential election reveals an \u201cill democracy\u201d. Indonesia President Joko Widodo said the world\u2019s most populous Muslim nation would work with the Trump administration. \u201cWe will keep good relations, especially in trade and investment as we know the US is one of Indonesia\u2019s major investors,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there will be no change.\u201d Japan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe sent his \u201cheartfelt congratulations\u201d to Trump. Abe said that \u201cas a very successful businessman with extraordinary talents, not only you made a great contribution to the growth of the US economy, but now as a strong leader, you have demonstrated your determination to lead the United States.\u201d Japan, a key US ally, said it would work closely with Trump to ensure stability in the Asia-Pacific region. \u201cThere is no change to the fact that the Japan-US alliance is the cornerstone of Japanese diplomacy, and Japan will cooperate closely with the US for peace and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region and the world,\u201d the chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, told reporters shortly before Trump was confirmed as president-elect. Katsuyuki Kawai, an aide to Abe, said he was planning to fly to Washington to meet Trump officials as early as next week. Officials in Tokyo denied that Abe had decided to send Kawai to the US because Japan had failed to prepare for a Trump victory. \u201cWe have been preparing to respond to any situation, because our stance is that our alliance with the US remains the cornerstone of our diplomacy, whoever becomes the next president,\u201d Suga said. Malaysia Prime minister Najib Razak \u2013 embroiled in a corruption scandal at home that is being investigated in the United States \u2013 sent a congratulatory message to Trump: \u201cMr Trump\u2019s success shows that politicians should never take voters for granted. Opinion polls, and established political figures, all underestimated the strength of his support. His appeal to Americans who have been left behind \u2013 those who want to see their government more focused on their interests and welfare, and less embroiled in foreign interventions that proved to be against US interests \u2013 have won Mr Trump the White House. He added the US and Malaysia \u201care firm allies in the worldwide fight against terrorism and extremism.\u201d Pakistan Pakistan\u2019s former president and army chief Pervez Musharraf congratulated Trump on \u201chis historic election\u201d. Writing on Facebook, he said the president-elect \u201cshould not quit from Afghanistan\u201d, the country where some US and international forces remain in place. \u201cI hope he will focus keenly to bring peace and stability around the world and demonstrate deliberate leadership in resolving the conflicts in the Indo-Pakistan subcontinent,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe must trust and work together to crush terrorism and eliminate extremism from a position of strength.\u201d Philippines The Philippine president, Rodrigo Duterte, who branded Obama a \u201cson of whore\u201d earlier this year, offered \u201cwarm congratulations\u201d to Trump. Duterte, who has expressed outrage almost daily with the Obama administration and threatened repeatedly to end one of Washington\u2019s most important Asian alliances, hailed the success of US democratic system and the American way of life, according to his communications secretary Martin Andanar. Duterte \u201clooks forward to working with the incoming administration for enhanced Philippines-US relations anchored on mutual respect, mutual benefit and shared commitment to democratic ideals and the rule of law,\u201d Andanar said. Africa Democratic Republic of the Congo President Joseph Kabila, who suspects the Obama administration of trying to oust him from power and whose aides have made little secret of their preferred winner, issued a statement congratulating Trump. Speaking both personally and \u201cin the name of the people\u201d of the troubled nation, Kabila offered his \u201cmost sincere congratulations\u201d to Trump for his \u201cbrilliant electoral victory and, through him, to the American people who, sovereign, have decided to trust him with their destiny\u201d.

Kenyatta reminded Trump that the \u201cties that bind Kenya and the United States of America are old, and based in the values that we hold dear: in democracy, in the rule of law, and in the equality of peoples.\u201d \u201cThese values remain dear to the peoples of both nations, and so our friendship will endure,\u201d a statement said. South Africa A statement from Jacob Zuma\u2019s office said: President Zuma conveyed his best wishes to the President-elect and looked forward to working with President-elect Trump to build on the strong relations that exists between the two countries. He underlined that South Africa further looked forward to working closely with the new Administration in the United States in promoting peace, security and prosperity around the world, especially on the African continent.\u201d South Sudan Minister of Information Michael Makuei welcomed Trump\u2019s victory, saying: \u201cI really doubt President Obama had any clear policy to South Sudan other than to destroy it. So we will definitely expect better relations with Trump \u2026 and the USA after the election.\u201d Uganda President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni said: I congratulate Mr. Trump on his election as the President of the United States of America. Elections in the US or any country are a matter for the people of that country. Our relationship with the United States will continue regardless of which leader or party is leading.

After a year of vague promises to strike a balance between environmental protection, a limping economy and a fraught relationship with Indigenous peoples, Trudeau\u2019s government will be forced to put these pledges to the test in imminent decisions on several massive energy projects. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time they\u2019re going to actually have to pick a side,\u201d said Bricker. </p> <p>It\u2019s a challenge that may get a boost from an unexpected source: international media. In a country long wary of being overshadowed by its southern neighbour, Trudeau has been wholeheartedly embraced by global media who delight in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/17/justin-trudeau-feminist-twitter-explodes\">his feminist views</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/life-and-physics/2016/apr/16/justin-trudeau-and-quantum-computers\">his take on quantum physics</a>. The international attention has helped propel his popularity at home, said Graves of EKOS Research Associates. \u201cI do believe that Canadians, one of the reasons they\u2019re so happy with the government is that they really like the way we\u2019re being seen on the world stage.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a sharp contrast to the previous government, he said. \u201cFrankly I had data showing that Canadians were ashamed and embarrassed about our image with our performance on things like climate change or our policies on Israel or moving to towards militarism.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d53360ff4b879a680faf85b1dae476e5fa90f512\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d53360ff4b879a680faf85b1dae476e5fa90f512/0_125_3428_2057/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Justin Trudeau and Barack Obama at the White House state dinner reception.

Vowing to restore middle-class progress, they\u2019ve raised taxes on the top 1% to help pay for a middle-class tax cut, as well as handed out a means tested universal child benefit.</p> <p>It\u2019s an approach that will have to start delivering growth and shared prosperity soon, said Graves, or risk jeopardising the government\u2019s unprecedented popularity. </p> <p>He likened it to the other challenges facing the government as they move into their second year, from democratic renewal to climate change. </p> <p>\u201cThese are really daunting challenges.

          "bodyText": "The line to get in stretched around the block and deep into a hotel parking lot. Thousands of people had turned up to an election campaign event in Medicine Hat, a small Albertan city in Canada\u2019s conservative heartland, hoping to catch a glimpse of Justin Trudeau. About 800 of them made it inside, cheering wildly as Trudeau spoke of first visiting the city with his father when he was just seven months old. Later, the Liberal party leader waded into the crowd outside, shaking hands and snapping selfies with admirers among the 1,600 or so people who had teemed around loudspeakers to hear his speech. The boisterous welcome came not during the election campaign which swept Trudeau to power, nor during the heady days after he assumed office 12 months ago \u2013 it took place during a local byelection last month, and offers a snapshot of an extraordinary political honeymoon that has come to define Trudeau\u2019s first year in office. \u201cThis is really uncharted territory,\u201d said Nik Nanos of Nanos Research. \u201cIn my 20 years of experience, no one has had a one-year honeymoon.\u201d Others question whether honeymoon is the appropriate word to capture what exactly is going on. \u201cHoneymoons last maybe a month or two, maybe three \u2013 but not a year.

The 44-year-old former high school teacher and snowboarding instructor swept into parliament at the helm of a majority government, after campaigning on an ambitious manifesto which promised to take bold action on climate change, revive the country\u2019s sluggish economy and reset the country\u2019s relationship with indigenous peoples. During the election campaign, his team racked up 219 promises that seemingly offered something for everyone. So far, 34 of these promises have been fulfilled and 64 are in progress. In their first year, the government has unmuzzled government scientists, ended Canada\u2019s airstrikes against Isis and brought in 33,239 Syrian refugees, among other actions. It hasn\u2019t all been smooth sailing; Trudeau and his government have been disparaged by indigenous people who continue to feel sidelined from decision making and Green voters who wonder why the government has adopted the carbon cutting targets of its predecessors. Revelations of fundraisers offering access to cabinet ministers for up to $1,500 a ticket have sparked questions about government transparency while at a youth labour forum last week, dozens of delegates turned their backs to Trudeau , heckling him to honour his promises on pipelines and tackling youth unemployment. But most see these as small knocks for a government that has political capital to spare. Polls routinely suggest that were an election to be held today, Trudeau and his party would earn an even greater number of seats than the 184 won last year in Canada\u2019s 338-seat House of Commons. \u201cThe reality is that they are very different from the previous government,\u201d said Nanos. The Trudeau government\u2019s popularity is hard to untangle from the divisiveness that dogged his Conservative predecessor, Stephen Harper, whose government shunned climate change obligations, slashed funding to federal efforts on gender equality and sought to ban women wearing the niqab from participating in citizenship ceremonies. At the outset of last year\u2019s election campaign, it was clear voters were looking for change. Many of Trudeau\u2019s actions so far \u2013 from launching a long-awaited inquiry into the thousands of missing and murdered indigenous women to implementing gender parity in his cabinet \u2013 have sought to demonstrate they are enacting the change they promised. Some of Trudeau\u2019s strength can also be explained by the weakness of the country\u2019s major opposition parties, said Nanos.

Trudeau\u2019s political honeymoon, he said, could stretch well into 2017 until the two opposition parties choose new leaders. Trudeau\u2019s popularity has endured even as his first nine months in office rank among the House of Commons\u2019 least productive in more than two decades, according to data compiled by the library of parliament. His government points to the myriad of consultations underway to explain the slow pace, but Canadians aren\u2019t necessarily looking for substance at this point, said Darrell Bricker of Ipsos Public Affairs. \u201cWhen we ask people directly: is it more style than substance, they say \u2018yes, it is more style than substance,\u2019 but they\u2019re enjoying the style.\u201d Canadians across the country regularly gather to snap selfies with the prime minister while social media gleefully shares photos of a shirtless Trudeau or as he shares an intimate moment with his wife, former television presenter Sophie Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau. \u201cHe\u2019s prime minister selfie, right?\u201d Bricker said, referring to the name given to him by his critics. \u201cAll of that stuff you wouldn\u2019t see Harper do \u2013 for good or for bad. It\u2019s very symbolic of the change.\u201d What emerges is an image of a young, dynamic and transparent government. \u201cThere is just generally a lightness associated with this government as opposed to what came before it,\u201d said Bricker. \u201cSo if you wanted to change this is a 180-degree change from what existed before.\u201d The hard work starts now, he said. Details must be hashed out on the government\u2019s plans to legalise recreational marijuana, reform the country\u2019s electoral system and meet its emission targets. After a year of vague promises to strike a balance between environmental protection, a limping economy and a fraught relationship with Indigenous peoples, Trudeau\u2019s government will be forced to put these pledges to the test in imminent decisions on several massive energy projects. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time they\u2019re going to actually have to pick a side,\u201d said Bricker. It\u2019s a challenge that may get a boost from an unexpected source: international media. In a country long wary of being overshadowed by its southern neighbour, Trudeau has been wholeheartedly embraced by global media who delight in his feminist views or his take on quantum physics. The international attention has helped propel his popularity at home, said Graves of EKOS Research Associates. \u201cI do believe that Canadians, one of the reasons they\u2019re so happy with the government is that they really like the way we\u2019re being seen on the world stage.\u201d It\u2019s a sharp contrast to the previous government, he said. \u201cFrankly I had data showing that Canadians were ashamed and embarrassed about our image with our performance on things like climate change or our policies on Israel or moving to towards militarism.\u201d The government\u2019s approval rating has persisted even as stagnation and rising inequality has given rise to Canada\u2019s worst economic outlook in two decades, said Graves. \u201cIn some respects he\u2019s sort of tapped into the same sentiment that drove Brexit and Trump but with a very different type of message \u2013 instead of take back control and close the borders and build walls, let\u2019s talk about sunny ways, let\u2019s talk about a more optimistic approach.\u201d The government has vowed to counter the slumping economy by pumping billions of dollars into infrastructure. Vowing to restore middle-class progress, they\u2019ve raised taxes on the top 1% to help pay for a middle-class tax cut, as well as handed out a means tested universal child benefit. It\u2019s an approach that will have to start delivering growth and shared prosperity soon, said Graves, or risk jeopardising the government\u2019s unprecedented popularity. He likened it to the other challenges facing the government as they move into their second year, from democratic renewal to climate change. \u201cThese are really daunting challenges. So yeah, \u2018we\u2019re consulting\u2019 will work for a while \u2013 but at some point you\u2019ve really got to come up with some very concrete and solid answers about how to deal with those tough problems.\u201d",

Vladimir Putin has a personal dislike of Hillary Clinton going back to her time as secretary of state, while Trump fits perfectly into the mould of \u201cchaos candidates\u201d that Russia has supported in other western countries.</p> <p>It would take a conspiracy theorist to believe Trump is actually a Kremlin stooge rather than simply a \u201cuseful idiot\u201d, and some in Russia believed a Trump presidency could actually have more potential for conflict than a Clinton one.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/14/hillary-clinton-email-hack-russia-cybersecurity\">Entire US political system \u2018under attack\u2019 by Russian hacking, experts warn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Under Clinton, relations would be unlikely to be rosy but would probably stay within a long-established paradigm of mutual distrust and limited cooperation on certain issues.<br></p> <p>US politics tends to be portrayed as driven by geopolitical interests rather than personalities, and so most ordinary Russians assume that little will change, whoever wins. Still, the warm words about Putin from Trump, and the slightly more positive tone of television coverage relating to the real estate tycoon, have both left their mark.

If we get attacked, Japan doesn\u2019t have to help us,\u201d he said. \u201cSomehow, that doesn\u2019t sound so fair.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s frequent claim that Japan is taking advantage of US largesse is inaccurate. Tokyo contributes \u00a5192bn ($1.84bn) a year towards maintaining the US military presence. US bases in Japan cost about $5.5bn a year, according to the Pentagon, about half of which goes on salaries and other personnel costs.</p> <p>South Korea, meanwhile, contributes $850m a year \u2013 about half the cost of maintaining 28,500 troops on the southern side of the heavily fortified border that divides the Korean peninsula.</p> <p>Yet Trump has returned to the theme throughout the campaign: \u201cAs far as Japan and other countries, we are being ripped off by everybody in the world,\u201d he said at an event in Las Vegas. \u201cWe\u2019re defending other countries, we\u2019re spending a fortune doing it. We have to tell Japan, in a very nice way, we have to tell Germany, all these countries, South Korea, we have a say, \u2018You have to help us out.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>More alarming than Trump\u2019s claim that Japan is not pulling its weight on bilateral security ties is his suggestion that Japan and South Korea should end their dependence on the US nuclear umbrella and develop their own nuclear deterrents.</p> <p>That, many analysts agree, could spark an Asia-Pacific arms race that would further destabilise an already tense region.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/justinmccurry\">Justin McCurry</a> in Tokyo</em></p> <h2>Afghanistan </h2> <p>Just as Afghanistan has been almost entirely absent from the two presidential campaigns, neither are the US elections a topic of debate in Afghan media, where the war with the Taliban and domestic political chaos take up most of the bandwidth.</p> <p>To the extent the elections are discussed by ordinary Afghans, conversations centre around Trump, particularly his demonization of Muslims, which gathered pace after the Orlando nightclub shooting in June. The perpetrator, Omar Mateen, was of Afghan origin, and Trump\u2019s explicit linking of Afghans to terrorism earned him widespread contempt.<br></p> <p>Afghans in general seem unsure of what either candidate has in store for their country, apart from two indications from the Trump campaign: his proposed ban on Muslims from entering America; and his calls to pull American troops home, or at least limit their role in Afghanistan, which would likely have a destabilising effect on the country. Neither is popular with Afghans.<br></p> <p>Recently, though, Afghans have mostly treated the US elections with a certain sarcastic distance. After the third presidential debate, Trump\u2019s refusal to accept the election results if he did not win led to a wave of snarky commentary on social media. Some suggested that perhaps the Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, would need to fly to Washington to broker a national unity government deal, as the US secretary of state, John Kerry, did after the divisive 2014 Afghan election.<br></p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sune-engel-rasmussen\">Sune Engel Rasmussen</a> in Kabul</em></p> <h2>Germany </h2> <p>If Hillary Clinton were to run against Donald Trump for the German presidency, she would win by a landslide.

In La Repubblica, the columnist Vittorio Zucconi said that, notwithstanding the obvious similarities between the two men \u2013 their hair, their treatment of women as sexual objects, their alleged avoidance of tax \u2013 both had captured the hearts of a certain class of voters who hate the political establishment. Among these voters, stories about the candidates\u2019 foibles did nothing to dent their popularity. Both could only be brought down by their own self-destructive tendencies, Zucconi concluded.</p> <p>Gianni Riotta, the former editor of Il Sole 24 Ore, said that \u2013 despite being a \u201cdisastrous\u201d prime minister \u2013 Berlusconi was a more astute politician than Trump has proven to be, having counted both George W Bush and Vladimir Putin as friends. Berlusconi \u2013 a confirmed billionaire with vast media holdings \u2013 was also a better businessman, Riotta said.</p> <p>In Italy, the race for the White House is almost always interpreted through the lens of the country\u2019s own fractured political landscape, and Italy\u2019s political leaders have not shied away from choosing sides.

The softer the Brexit, the happier the White House will be.

Increasingly Clinton may find herself needing to choose between Britain and Europe, something that will make the Foreign Office distinctly queasy.</p> <p>Foreign secretary Boris Johnson has already been manoeuvring to show his personal support for a more muscular Syrian policy in line with Clinton\u2019s own long-stated support for a no-fly zone. Britain will also be at the front of the queue if she chooses to take a more assertive line with Putin. At present, Britain has been the rhetorical outrider, but it may get some practical backing from the White House. The UK will hope stabilisation of its defence budget, the renewal of Trident nuclear submarines, and its willingness to send troops to the Baltic states will ensure that it remains at the front of the queue when it comes to security cooperation, if not a trade deal.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/patrickwintour\">Patrick Wintour</a> in London </em></p> <h2>Iraq</h2> <p>Iraq is currently consumed by the battle to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/29/iraqi-shia-militias-tighten-noose-on-isis-with-mosul-offensive\">retake Mosul from Isis</a>, and preparing for its own elections next year, so the US election has received relatively little attention \u2013 even though the outcome is likely to be critical to Iraq\u2019s future.</p> <p>Renewed American military and financial support has been key to the fight against Isis, particularly in the current campaign to retake Mosul, the jihadi group\u2019s last major stronghold in the country.<br></p> <p>Over $1.6bn was provided for training and equipping Iraqi forces in 2016 alone.

          "bodyText": "Russia Russia has played an unexpectedly prominent role in this year\u2019s US election, although the extent of the Kremlin\u2019s involvement in hacking Democratic servers and the WikiLeaks disclosures will probably never be known. What is clear is that Moscow has enjoyed making trouble. Vladimir Putin has a personal dislike of Hillary Clinton going back to her time as secretary of state, while Trump fits perfectly into the mould of \u201cchaos candidates\u201d that Russia has supported in other western countries. It would take a conspiracy theorist to believe Trump is actually a Kremlin stooge rather than simply a \u201cuseful idiot\u201d, and some in Russia believed a Trump presidency could actually have more potential for conflict than a Clinton one. Under Clinton, relations would be unlikely to be rosy but would probably stay within a long-established paradigm of mutual distrust and limited cooperation on certain issues. US politics tends to be portrayed as driven by geopolitical interests rather than personalities, and so most ordinary Russians assume that little will change, whoever wins. Still, the warm words about Putin from Trump, and the slightly more positive tone of television coverage relating to the real estate tycoon, have both left their mark. A poll over the summer found that 22% of Russians had a positive opinion of Trump, compared with just 8% for Clinton. Shaun Walker in Moscow Mexico Trump\u2019s rise has stirred more unease and indignation in Mexico than perhaps any other country. He launched his campaign by describing Mexican migrants as rapists and robbers and promised to build a border wall, with Mexico paying. Trump\u2019s wall and his pledges to rip up the North American Free Trade Agreement, or Nafta, and slap tariffs on Mexican-made products have also caused preoccupation in business circles, which over the past 25 years have bet on closer US relations. Mexicans have responded by mocking Trump with memes, lampooning him with pi\u00f1atas and burning him in effigy, but ironically the candidate may have ceded the position of most-hated political figure to Mexico\u2019s own president. Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto was widely rebuked for sharing a platform with Trump at the presidential palace in August and failing to challenge his anti-Mexican comments. Meanwhile, Trump has frequently been compared to Mexico\u2019s own perennial outsider, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, a leftwing populist who has twice refused to accept election results which went against him. Other parts of Trump\u2019s discourse sound eerily familiar to Mexicans, such as his pledge to lock up his opponent. Some have even mused that Trump has finally cracked the idea that the US is a model for Mexico. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt so third world as when I saw the gringos in crisis because things could happen there that already happened here,\u201d tweeted Esteban Illades, editor of the Mexican magazine Nexos. David Agren in Mexico City Iran In Tehran, one thing is certain: no matter which candidate wins the US presidential race, Iran will face a tougher time ahead. Even Hillary Clinton \u2013 seen in Tehran as the lesser of two evils \u2013 has consistently been more hawkish on Iran than Barack Obama. But Iranians have been amused by the bitter rivalry been Clinton and Trump and in an unprecedented move, state TV broadcast the last presidential debate. Trump\u2019s talk of election-rigging gave hardliners a sense of schadenfreude, reminding them of Washington\u2019s accusations that Iran\u2019s 2009 vote was rigged. Meanwhile, the tycoon\u2019s toxic rhetoric and use of the media remind many of their own former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Although Clinton served as secretary of state under Obama, she is mainly seen as the architect of the economic sanctions that brought Iran back to the negotiating table, rather than the person who secured last year\u2019s nuclear deal. Credit for the landmark deal goes to her successor, John Kerry. Iranians have not forgotten Clinton\u2019s past comments on Iran, and an extract from a 2008 interview with ABC has been shared widely on social media. In the clip, she says: \u201cI want the Iranians to know that if I\u2019m the president, we will attack Iran \u2026 we would be able to totally obliterate them.\u201d The comments came after a question about a hypothetical Iranian attack against Israel but have been circulated more recently out of context. Analyst Ahmad Shirzad told the reformist newspaper Shargh that Obama had been \u201cIran\u2019s best choice\u201d to avoid confrontation \u2013 and that it was unlikely that Clinton would match him. Saeed Kamali Dehghan, Iran correspondent China The rulers of one-party China are not known for asking the masses what they think of their political masters, and there have been no official polls on the US elections. But the Communist party has made no attempt to disguise its own delight at the political turmoil unfolding on the other side of the Pacific. \u201cFor a long time, many Americans regarded US democracy as the gold standard,\u201d one prominent scholar mused in the party-run Global Times newspaper. \u201cBut more and more Americans feel shame about this kind of democracy, and this year\u2019s election. \u201cChinese people can evaluate the US system of democracy when watching its general election.\u201d A study released last month by the Pew Research Center suggested that if China could vote, Hillary Clinton would come out on top. Pew said 37% of Chinese held a positive view of Clinton compared with just 22% for her Republican rival. Forty per cent viewed Trump unfavourably against 35% for Clinton. Those figures may reflect a distaste for the way in which Trump has made China-bashing a recurrent feature of his campaign, accusing it of \u201craping\u201d the US and creating global warming as a \u201choax\u201d. They might also speak to approval for Clinton\u2019s outspokenness on civil rights issues. Chinese feminists still revere Clinton for a 1995 speech she gave at a UN conference in Beijing in which she declared: \u201cHuman rights are women\u2019s rights \u2013 and women\u2019s rights are human rights.\u201d But if the people prefer Clinton, some suspect the party itself is secretly hoping a Trump presidency would boost China\u2019s quest for superpower status by dealing a severe blow to its main rival. Tom Phillips in Beijing Canada The American election has been closely watched north of the border, with many in Canada nervously wondering who will end up at the helm of Canada\u2019s largest trading partner. The US accounted for 60% of Canada\u2019s global trade in 2014, a relationship underpinned by Nafta. Trump, who has described the agreement as \u201cthe worst trade deal in history\u201d, has vowed to renegotiate the terms and would move to withdraw the US from the deal if Canada and Mexico refuse. Polls suggest Canadians overwhelmingly support Hillary Clinton, with up to 80% of Canadians saying they would cast their vote for her. But Trump has attracted a small but loyal legion of fans in Canada who say his promise to green-light the Keystone XL pipeline shows that a Trump presidency could benefit to Canada. Little about Clinton\u2019s campaign has been discussed in Canada. Instead her candidacy has come to be defined by who she is not: Trump. Canadian politicians on both the left and right have voiced concerns over the Republican nominee, but Justin Trudeau, Canada\u2019s prime minister, has repeatedly shied away from offering his views on the candidates. \u201cI\u2019m not going to pick a fight with Donald Trump right now. I\u2019m not going to support him either, obviously,\u201d he told a forum in early March. It was a softening of the stance he took in December when he described Trump\u2019s proposal to bar foreign Muslims as \u201cignorant [and] irresponsible\u201d. But Trudeau has since become increasingly tight-lipped, heeding advisers who warn that Canada must not be perceived to be interfering in the American election. Ashifa Kassam in Toronto Israel No foreign relationship is more important to Israelis than the relationship with the US, and the scrutiny of potential occupants of the White House has had all the passionate intensity of the weighing of a potential prom night date. After the Obama-Netanyahu years, which have been marked by a frosty and difficult relationship, the question \u2013 boiled to its crude simplicities \u2013 is whether Hillary would be more friendly than Obama and whether Trump, despite his pro-Israel noises, is tainted by the antisemitism of some of his supporters. Oddly, given the history of Obama\u2019s relationship with the Israeli prime minister and Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s controversial speech to Congress opposing the Iran deal, Netanyahu has been unexpectedly cautious on the elections. Of more immediate concern to Netanyahu and his allies in recent weeks has been whether, in the time between election day and the inauguration, Obama might launch or support a new initiative on the Israel-Palestine peace process. Netanyahu met both candidates during his visit to the UN general assembly but otherwise has been discreet \u2013 although Israel Hayom, the free mass distribution paper nicknamed the \u201cBibiton\u201d for its support of Netanyahu, has seemed most sympathetic of the Israeli media to Trump. If there has been less interest in Hillary Clinton it is because she is seen as a known quantity, cautiously regarded as more supportive of Israel than Obama. Trump, however, is seen as a different issue. Although he has said he \u201cwould be great for Israel\u201d and has pointed to his Jewish son-in-law Jared Kushner, others remember earlier comments where he said he would be neutral on the Israel-Palestine issue. The reality is that despite his sometimes strongly pro-Israel statements (and the apparent support of one of Netanyahu\u2019s biggest backers, the casino magnate Sheldon Adelson) Trump alarms many Israelis. Where they see in Clinton a continuation of a status quo and experience of the region, Trump\u2019s approach to foreign policy is seen as wayward, imprecise at best, and contradictory. His comments in December to the Republican Jewish Coalition, in which he said he suspected many members wouldn\u2019t back him because he was rich and didn\u2019t want their contributions, was seen by some in the Israeli media as reinforcing stereotyping of Jews. His stance on other issues, including immigration, and his racist remarks about Mexican migrants were also seen as deeply uncomfortable. More serious still has been the kind of people that Trump has attracted and the views of people and groups Trump himself has retweeted. The liberal daily Haaretz framed the question in a bald but careful headline: Donald Trump an anti-Semite? Israel\u2019s Top GOP Supporter Insists Otherwise. Peter Beaumont in Jerusalem Middle East In the Middle East, many are wary of what a new president in the Oval Office will mean for American policy in the region. Washington\u2019s traditional allies are eager for a more hawkish leader than Obama, whose nuclear deal with Iran and reluctance to deploy US forces against the regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria have fueled fears of an American realignment towards Tehran and away from the Gulf states. While Clinton is often seen as a known quantity in the region \u2013 and one who is more likely to defend America\u2019s longtime allies and clients \u2013 most see Trump as an unknown whose unpredictability could further destabilize the region. Trump\u2019s incendiary comments on banning Muslims from entering the country have also aroused disbelief and mockery, but social media users often note that Trump\u2019s populist demagoguery matches that deployed by Arab despots. Others in the region see the Trump candidacy as a symbol of western democracy and values gone awry, hinting at a more profound global realignment. \u201cFrom our point of view, the revolutions of the Arab spring were an inflection point to measure the west\u2019s strength in defending democracy, and they failed,\u201d wrote Jamil Matar, a columnist in the Lebanese newspaper Assafir. \u201cWhat hope now do we have in a west that is in constant decline?\u201d Kareem Shaheen in Beirut North Korea Kim Jong-un is hoping Donald Trump will be the next occupant of the White House. The North Korean leader has not publicly commented on the US presidential election, but if state media are to be believed, Trump represents his best hope of engagement with the west. The DPRK Today newspaper has described the billionaire property mogul as a \u201cwise politician\u201d and \u201cprescient presidential candidate\u201d. \u201cIt turns out that Trump is not the rough-talking, screwy, ignorant candidate they say he is, but is actually a wise politician and a prescient presidential candidate,\u201d Han Yong-muk wrote in a column. Residents of the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, believe Trump would be more open to dialogue \u2013 a key regime demand that would allow it to use its nuclear programme to secure a no-first-strike guarantee from the US and the resumption of international aid. Keisuke Fukuda, a Japanese journalist with Toyo Keizai magazine, said he had interviewed North Korean citizens who were \u201clooking forward to change\u201d in Washington\u2019s political direction. The desire to talk appears to be reciprocal. In June, Trump said he would welcome a visit to the US by Kim Jong-un, although he would stop short of honouring the dictator with an official state dinner. Despite North Korea\u2019s growing isolation, eight years of the Obama presidency have not been all bad for the country. Clinton\u2019s approach to the regime is not expected to differ significantly from Obama\u2019s policy of sanctions and international isolation \u2013 measures she supported as secretary of state and which have failed to dent Kim\u2019s missile and nuclear weapons programmes. Trump has called on China to do more to rein in Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear ambitions \u2013 perhaps the only North Korea initiative on which he and Clinton agree. Justin McCurry Japan and South Korea North Korea\u2019s apparent enthusiasm for a Trump presidency could be connected to his desire to dismantle the postwar arrangements that many believe have ensured the security of the US\u2019s most important allies in the Asia-Pacific, Japan and South Korea. In a campaign speech late last year, Trump described Japan, where 47,000 US troops are based, as a security freeloader. \u201cIf somebody attacks Japan, we have to immediately go and start World War III, OK? If we get attacked, Japan doesn\u2019t have to help us,\u201d he said. \u201cSomehow, that doesn\u2019t sound so fair.\u201d Trump\u2019s frequent claim that Japan is taking advantage of US largesse is inaccurate. Tokyo contributes \u00a5192bn ($1.84bn) a year towards maintaining the US military presence. US bases in Japan cost about $5.5bn a year, according to the Pentagon, about half of which goes on salaries and other personnel costs. South Korea, meanwhile, contributes $850m a year \u2013 about half the cost of maintaining 28,500 troops on the southern side of the heavily fortified border that divides the Korean peninsula. Yet Trump has returned to the theme throughout the campaign: \u201cAs far as Japan and other countries, we are being ripped off by everybody in the world,\u201d he said at an event in Las Vegas. \u201cWe\u2019re defending other countries, we\u2019re spending a fortune doing it. We have to tell Japan, in a very nice way, we have to tell Germany, all these countries, South Korea, we have a say, \u2018You have to help us out.\u2019\u201d More alarming than Trump\u2019s claim that Japan is not pulling its weight on bilateral security ties is his suggestion that Japan and South Korea should end their dependence on the US nuclear umbrella and develop their own nuclear deterrents. That, many analysts agree, could spark an Asia-Pacific arms race that would further destabilise an already tense region. Justin McCurry in Tokyo Afghanistan Just as Afghanistan has been almost entirely absent from the two presidential campaigns, neither are the US elections a topic of debate in Afghan media, where the war with the Taliban and domestic political chaos take up most of the bandwidth. To the extent the elections are discussed by ordinary Afghans, conversations centre around Trump, particularly his demonization of Muslims, which gathered pace after the Orlando nightclub shooting in June. The perpetrator, Omar Mateen, was of Afghan origin, and Trump\u2019s explicit linking of Afghans to terrorism earned him widespread contempt. Afghans in general seem unsure of what either candidate has in store for their country, apart from two indications from the Trump campaign: his proposed ban on Muslims from entering America; and his calls to pull American troops home, or at least limit their role in Afghanistan, which would likely have a destabilising effect on the country. Neither is popular with Afghans. Recently, though, Afghans have mostly treated the US elections with a certain sarcastic distance. After the third presidential debate, Trump\u2019s refusal to accept the election results if he did not win led to a wave of snarky commentary on social media. Some suggested that perhaps the Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, would need to fly to Washington to broker a national unity government deal, as the US secretary of state, John Kerry, did after the divisive 2014 Afghan election. Sune Engel Rasmussen in Kabul Germany If Hillary Clinton were to run against Donald Trump for the German presidency, she would win by a landslide. An October survey run by the polling institute Infratest Dimap found that 86% of Germans would vote for the former US secretary of state. An earlier poll discovered that even among supporters of the rightwing populists Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland, only one in four could imagine voting for Trump. The widely held view is that a Trump presidency would add further turmoil to an increasingly unstable global economy, a development which Germany, as an exporting nation, would suffer particularly strongly. \u201cDonald Trump could endanger our prosperity,\u201d wrote Die Welt. But Der Spiegel also noted a distinct lack of enthusiasm for Clinton\u2019s presidency among the German public. \u201cThe fact that Clinton\u2019s public appearances can be wooden should not lessen our faith in her. How often has Angela Merkel been accused of a lack of passion? And now she is the most respected leading politician in the world.\u201d The German chancellor herself has barely commented on the presidential race. Having been attacked by Trump for \u201cruining Germany\u201d, Merkel has consistently passed on the opportunity to retaliate, though her dislike of political grandstanding is well-known. Germany\u2019s foreign minister, on the other hand, has been more outspoken, doing away with diplomatic protocol when he described Trump in August as a \u201chate preacher\u201d. Frank-Walter Steinmeier openly stated he was \u201cnot neutral\u201d on the question of the US presidency, and that listening to the Republican candidate\u2019s tirades made him \u201cfrightful of what will happen to this world\u201d if he came to power. Philip Oltermann in Berlin Italy In Italy, a country that traditionally has great affection for the US, support for Hillary Clinton runs high, with polls showing that about 63% of Italian voters would support the former secretary of state over Donald Trump. Italians are well aware that the Republican candidate has been compared to two of the country\u2019s own former leaders: the fascist Benito Mussolini, and Silvio Berlusconi, the billionaire media mogul who won three elections but who was ultimately brought down by a series of tax and sex scandals. With the wisdom of hindsight, Trump has been labelled \u201cAmerica\u2019s Berlusconi\u201d. In La Repubblica, the columnist Vittorio Zucconi said that, notwithstanding the obvious similarities between the two men \u2013 their hair, their treatment of women as sexual objects, their alleged avoidance of tax \u2013 both had captured the hearts of a certain class of voters who hate the political establishment. Among these voters, stories about the candidates\u2019 foibles did nothing to dent their popularity. Both could only be brought down by their own self-destructive tendencies, Zucconi concluded. Gianni Riotta, the former editor of Il Sole 24 Ore, said that \u2013 despite being a \u201cdisastrous\u201d prime minister \u2013 Berlusconi was a more astute politician than Trump has proven to be, having counted both George W Bush and Vladimir Putin as friends. Berlusconi \u2013 a confirmed billionaire with vast media holdings \u2013 was also a better businessman, Riotta said. In Italy, the race for the White House is almost always interpreted through the lens of the country\u2019s own fractured political landscape, and Italy\u2019s political leaders have not shied away from choosing sides. True to his own centrist instincts, prime minister Matteo Renzi, head of the Democratic party, publicly sided with Hillary Clinton even before she won the Democratic nomination. On the right, the xenophobic head of the Northern League, Matteo Salvini, travelled to the US to lend his support to Donald Trump, while a top official of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement said he would side with Jill Stein, the Green party candidate. Stephanie Kirchgaessner in Rome United Kingdom The Foreign Office is already preparing to breathe a sign of relief if its favoured candidate, Hillary Clinton, romps home: it would mean a reliable president who is more emotionally engaged with Europe, the renewed threat posed by Russia, and a solution to the Syria crisis. Britain sees its relationship with the US as key to countering the perception that Brexit will lead to a more isolationist UK foreign policy. Relations between the UK and the US under David Cameron and Barack Obama were never poor, but they were punctuated by bumps: the Commons failure to back military action against Syria\u2019s use of chemical weapons in 2013, Cameron\u2019s risky and ultimately disastrous pledge to stage a referendum on Brexit, and Obama\u2019s criticism that the UK and France took their eye off the ball in Libya, allowing the country to descend into chaos. Above all, Obama never seemed able to grasp the impact of the refugee crisis caused by the Syrian war. As the UK negotiates its departure from the European Union, Clinton will hope that it does not lead to an acrimonious divorce that destabilises the world economy. The softer the Brexit, the happier the White House will be. A President Clinton would also hope Brexit does not lead to a downgrade of Nato, or duplication with a more assertive EU foreign and defence policy. Increasingly Clinton may find herself needing to choose between Britain and Europe, something that will make the Foreign Office distinctly queasy. Foreign secretary Boris Johnson has already been manoeuvring to show his personal support for a more muscular Syrian policy in line with Clinton\u2019s own long-stated support for a no-fly zone. Britain will also be at the front of the queue if she chooses to take a more assertive line with Putin. At present, Britain has been the rhetorical outrider, but it may get some practical backing from the White House. The UK will hope stabilisation of its defence budget, the renewal of Trident nuclear submarines, and its willingness to send troops to the Baltic states will ensure that it remains at the front of the queue when it comes to security cooperation, if not a trade deal. Patrick Wintour in London Iraq Iraq is currently consumed by the battle to retake Mosul from Isis, and preparing for its own elections next year, so the US election has received relatively little attention \u2013 even though the outcome is likely to be critical to Iraq\u2019s future. Renewed American military and financial support has been key to the fight against Isis, particularly in the current campaign to retake Mosul, the jihadi group\u2019s last major stronghold in the country. Over $1.6bn was provided for training and equipping Iraqi forces in 2016 alone. US special forces troops and air power are providing key support to the broad coalition now marching on the city. The US also sends hundreds of millions of dollars to Iraq for non-military aid, which will be particularly needed in Mosul. The US defence secretary, Ash Carter, has said he is already in talks about possible support for reconstruction. But Trump has criticised the Mosul operation, and long made clear he wants to reduce foreign aid, particularly to countries he thinks \u201chate\u201d the United States. Resentment about the 2003 invasion and its fallout would probably put Iraq on that list. Clinton by contrast is expected to continue backing Iraq in its fight against Isis, and more broadly. So Iraqis who are following the election closely are most likely to back a Clinton victory. Even in northern Kurdistan, where Republicans are generally popular, there is little support this year for a man seen locally as \u201ca bigot and uncontrollable\u201d.

The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (Ceta) would abolish most tariffs between the EU and Canada and pull down many barriers to transatlantic business.&nbsp; Conservative politicians, including Boris Johnson and David Davis, have hailed the treaty as a model for post-Brexit Britain. But Ceta has to be approved by all EU member states: it has faced opposition from regional parliaments in Belgium and scrutiny from Germany\u2019s highest court. Some fear the UK could encounter similar problems in striking a free-trade agreement with the EU. The British government has dismissed the parallel: officials argue that putting up trade barriers (Brexit) is very different from taking them down (Ceta).</p>\n    </div> \n   </figure> \n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The Belgian compromise came too late for an EU-Canada summit that had been scheduled for Thursday. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, had been due to meet the EU leaders Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker in Brussels, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/27/justin-trudeau-canadian-pm-cancels-brussels-trip-talks-trade-deal-eu\">but decided at the last minute not to get on the plane</a>, as Belgian politicians wrangled over the agreement late on Wednesday night.</p> \n<p>Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, the EU trade commissioner leading the trade talks with Canada, said she hoped a date could be set soon to sign the accord. Tusk, the European council president, sounded a note of caution, tweeting:</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/eucopresident/status/791589981341048832\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I am glad for good news from PM <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CharlesMichel\">@CharlesMichel</a>.

Magnette had also raised objections to a proposed court system for settling disputes between foreign investors and governments.</p> \n<p>One concession he won means that Belgium would be able to go to the European court of justice to determine whether a system of investor-state tribunals were compatible with EU law. The four-page document contains a guarantee that the Belgian government will assess the socio-economic and environmental impact of Ceta.</p> \n<p>The Walloon minister-president, who has been dubbed \u201cSuper-Magnette\u201d in the Belgian media, said: \u201cWallonia is extremely happy that our demands have been heard.\u201d </p> \n<p>Speaking of the delay, Magnette said he was \u201csorry for our European partners and for the Canadians, but what we managed to get here is important not just for Wallonians, but for all Europeans\u201d.</p> \n<p>The special court that Ceta would create has proved so controversial that the commission has decided it will not come into force immediately.

          "bodyText": "European Union leaders have expressed hope of signing a trade deal with Canada after Belgian politicians overcame differences that had been blocking the treaty. The Belgian prime minister, Charles Michel, confirmed that leaders of five regional parliaments had reached an agreement with the federal government shortly after midday on Thursday. He tweeted: The Belgian compromise \u2013 a four-page text that sits alongside the 1,600-page treaty \u2013 was approved by ambassadors from 28 EU member states on Thursday afternoon. Belgium\u2019s regional parliaments are expected to endorse the text on Friday, paving the way for the deal to come into force on a temporary basis. Canada\u2019s foreign minister St\u00e9phane Dion said he was \u201cprudently optimistic\u201d that the treaty could be signed: \u201cIf it happens, it is excellent news.\u201d But he added that \u201ca scalded cat fears cold water\u201d. The Belgian compromise came too late for an EU-Canada summit that had been scheduled for Thursday. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, had been due to meet the EU leaders Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker in Brussels, but decided at the last minute not to get on the plane, as Belgian politicians wrangled over the agreement late on Wednesday night. Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, the EU trade commissioner leading the trade talks with Canada, said she hoped a date could be set soon to sign the accord. Tusk, the European council president, sounded a note of caution, tweeting: The comprehensive economic and trade agreement, known as Ceta, which has been seven years in the making, stumbled near the finish line amid strong opposition from the Belgian regional parliament of Wallonia. The EU requires all 28 member states to support Ceta for the treaty to come into force, but the Belgian federal government, which has always backed the trade treaty, was barred from giving its consent because of opposition from regional parliaments in Wallonia and Brussels. Paul Magnette, Wallonia\u2019s minister-president, who had been leading opposition to the agreement, had wanted to reopen talks with Canada, but the EU institutions insisted that was impossible. Wallonia has been nervous about exposing its agricultural sector to competition from Canadian farmers. Magnette had also raised objections to a proposed court system for settling disputes between foreign investors and governments. One concession he won means that Belgium would be able to go to the European court of justice to determine whether a system of investor-state tribunals were compatible with EU law. The four-page document contains a guarantee that the Belgian government will assess the socio-economic and environmental impact of Ceta. The Walloon minister-president, who has been dubbed \u201cSuper-Magnette\u201d in the Belgian media, said: \u201cWallonia is extremely happy that our demands have been heard.\u201d Speaking of the delay, Magnette said he was \u201csorry for our European partners and for the Canadians, but what we managed to get here is important not just for Wallonians, but for all Europeans\u201d. The special court that Ceta would create has proved so controversial that the commission has decided it will not come into force immediately. EU member states insisted that national parliaments should have a say on aspects of the EU-Canada deal that touch on national competences. Even if the EU and Canada sign the treaty in the coming weeks, Ceta will only become a complete and permanent legal document following ratification by at least 38 national and regional parliaments in Europe. Only the backing of national parliaments would trigger the creation of an exclusive trade court to replace the investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS), the existing system for resolving trade disputes that has existed since the 1960s. This system is written into thousands of investment contracts, including 1,400 involving EU countries. Critics have rung alarm bells about the scope ISDS gives private companies to sue governments. The commission argues that its proposed changes to existing investor courts deepen transparency and end conflicts of interest, as judges would be appointed by governments and not companies, but critics have dismissed the reforms as rebranding. Campaign groups welcomed the Belgian challenge to the investor-state tribunals. \u201cThe use of investment tribunals allows companies to sue governments for lost profits if they introduce laws to protect people or the environment,\u201d said Paul de Clerck of Friends of the Earth Europe. \u201cThese corporate courts have no place in our democracies and we welcome the stance of the dissenting Belgian regions in contending them.\u201d The European commission had no immediate comment on the challenge to the investor court idea it has championed, but a spokesperson said events were unfolding in a good direction. \u201cWhat matters is not when [the Ceta signing] happens but the fact that it happens and it will happen.\u201d Shortly after the compromise was announced, several dozen activists launched a rowdy, but peaceful protest outside the commission headquarters in Brussels. Holding aloft banners reading \u201cStop Ceta\u201d, protesters banged drums, occasionally jeered at passing EU officials and sang songs, including the Les Mis\u00e9rables musical number, Can You Hear the People Sing. The cliffhanger story of the EU-Canada trade treaty is seen as a bad omen for post-Brexit Britain as it seeks a trade agreement with Europe. Britain\u2019s secretary of state for trade, Liam Fox, told MPs on Wednesday that the difficulties over Ceta underscored the importance of the UK signing a trade deal before it leaves the EU. The UK would only face a procedure similar to Ceta, he said, if it failed to conclude a trade agreement before the end of two years of divorce negotiations under the EU\u2019s article 50. \u201cThat sort of procedure would only be undertaken were we to leave the European Union after our article 50 period without any agreement whatsoever and were looking to seek a new FTA [free-trade agreement] from outside,\u201d he said. Some observers think that is a likely prospect, as the article 50 divorce talks are dedicated to unwinding Britain\u2019s EU membership and European leaders will not sign a trade deal before agreeing the divorce settlement. Fox, a prominent leave campaigner, said the experience of Ceta might cause some to think twice before seeking a trade agreement with the EU. \u201cThose who put politics ahead of prosperity might want to think twice,\u201d he said.",

          "bodyText": "Time for a recap, after a very busy few hours. Britain\u2019s economy has defied fears that it would be dragged into an immediate recession following the EU referendum. The first official healthcheck of growth in the last quarter showed that GDP rose by 0.5% between July and September. That\u2019s slower than the 0.7% recorded in April-June but faster than expected. The services sector provided all the expansion, though, with growth of 0.8%. Manufacturing, construction and agriculture all shrank, showing that the UK economy remains unbalanced. Interestingly, film and production provided a major boost to growth. That suggests Britain is benefitting from the new wave of streaming services: Chancellor Philip Hammond welcomed the news, saying it shows the UK economy is resilient as it begins Brexit negotiations. But a series of economists have warned that growth will slow further in 2017. Higher inflation will eat into real wages too. In another boost, Nissan has announced new investment plans for its Sunderland plant. The move guarantees 7,000 jobs, and eases concerns that production could be moved to France. Prime minister Theresa May says it\u2019s a vote of confidence in the UK. But what has the government offered Nissan? Ministers are refusing to give details, but that hasn\u2019t stopped the wider car industry seeking guarantees against damage from Brexit. Labour have warned the government against carving up deals behind closed doors, and instead provide a comprehensive plan for Brexit. And over in Brussels, Wallonia has dropped its opposition to Europe\u2019s new trade deal with Canada. That\u2019s probably all for today, unless anything else major happens. I\u2019ll be back tomorrow with more live coverage, including growth figures for France and the US. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Greg Clarke, the UK business secretary, isn\u2019t revealing what the government has promised to Nissan. According to my colleague Peter Walker, Clarke just waffled through half a dozen questions on the World At One, despite being repeatedly asked if Nissan has been given a deal. The best we got out of Clarke is this nugget: There\u2019s no question of financial compensation over tariffs, because we\u2019ve said that what is necessary is that we are going to maintain the competitiveness of the sector. But otherwise, it was like a rerun of Just A Minute (but without the humour). Keep an eye on Politics Live for more reaction: Bang on cue.... Britain\u2019s car industry is demanding assurance that it will be protected from any trade tariffs or migration curbs following the UK\u2019s exit from the EU. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders, says: \u201cToday\u2019s announcement is good news for UK Automotive and jobs, confirming Britain as a leader in automotive production. To secure this position, however, we need government to provide public assurance to investors that our advantages will be maintained \u2013 namely, a competitive business environment, the ability to recruit talent from abroad and the continuation of all the benefits of the single market as we leave the EU.\u201d Carlos Ghosn is clutching a piece of paper, promising help from the government if Britain\u2019s exit from the EU hurts Nissan. So says Reuters, which reports: Britain has given Nissan a written commitment of extra support in the event that Brexit reduces the competitiveness of its Sunderland plant, in return for new production investments by the Japanese carmaker, a source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. In addition to unconditional investment aid, Britain pledged in a letter to offer further relief if the terms of Britain\u2019s European Union exit ended up harming the plant\u2019s performance, the source said. That explains why Nisson has committed to making the Qashqai and the X-Trail in Sunderland. But surely other carmakers are going to want a similar deal, as Buzzfeed\u2019s Alberto Nardelli tweets: Our political reporter Jessica Elgot has full details of Labour\u2019s reaction to Nissan\u2019s announcement: John McDonnell, Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, criticised the deal done with Nissan as a \u201cchaotic\u201d strategy. In a speech where he had criticised the government for appearing to prioritise financial services over manufacturing and small businesses, said there had been no public discussion of the deal hashed out for the car maker. \u201cWe know nothing about it,\u201d he said. \u201cAre they literally going to decide factory by factory which one gets support? We have to have a comprehensive plan, and this is chaos at the moment.\u201d \u201cWe are trying to get a consensus and heal the divisions the referendum brought and we cannot do that with secret deals behind closed doors. It will divide our country once more. The first deal looked like it would be protecting financial services, paid for by others. And now with Nissan, other manufacturers are saying what are we going to get? We have to have a comprehensive plan. What we need is more openness and transparency and accountability.\u201d The Unite union are understandably delighted that the 7,000 Nissan jobs in Sunderland are safe, along with thousands more in the supply chain. Unite assistant general secretary Tony Burke says it recognises the UK car industry\u2019s world-leading status. \u201cNissan\u2019s decision is a massive vote of confidence in the skills and expertise of a world-class workforce and testament to their hard work which has made the Sunderland plant one of the most productive in the Nissan family. Burke says the government must now secure tariff-free access to the single market, to help all UK car markets. Here\u2019s Labour MP Matthew Pennycook on the Nissan announcement: More news! The deadlock in Belgium that was preventing the EU signing a trade deal with Canada has been broken! Prime Minister Charles Michel has declared that \u201can agreement\u201d has been reached with the French-speaking communities in Wallonia who sensationally blocked the deal last week. Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, the Eu trade commissioner, says it\u2019s an important breakthrough, that could mean the deal can now be signed. Unfortunately, Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau has already cancelled his trip to Brussels to sign the deal. (he was due to land today). And he needn\u2019t pack his suitcase just yet. European Council chief Donald Tusk says he won\u2019t be in touch until all the paperwork is definitely ready. Here\u2019s our news story about Nissan\u2019s new commitment to Sunderland: John McDonnell, Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, isn\u2019t impressed that Nissan have apparently cut a deal to stay in Sunderland. Sky\u2019s Faisal Islam has the details: Nissan\u2019s surprise announcement came just as McDonnell was giving a speech about the economy, which is rather bad luck for Labour (unless the dark arts of political spin are in play...). Our Politics Live blog has been tracking it though: Prime minister Theresa May says Nissan has given Britain a \u201cvote of confidence\u201d, but she doesn\u2019t reveal what promises she has given the carmaker..... Conservative MP Michael Fabricant is rather pleased by Nissan\u2019s announcement: It\u2019s official! The next Qashqai will indeed be build in Sunderland, despite the uncertainty over Britain\u2019s future. Nissan is also pledging to build its next 4x4 X-Trail vehicle there too. And the company also confirms that Theresa May\u2019s government has given a \u2018commitment\u2019 that the plant\u2019s competitiveness won\u2019t be damaged by Brexit. Here\u2019s the official statement: Nissan Motor Company Ltd. today announced, following its Executive Committee meeting, that it will produce the next Qashqai and will add production of the next X-Trail model at its Sunderland, U.K. Plant. Nissan\u2019s decision follows the U.K. government\u2019s commitment to ensure that the Sunderland plant remains competitive. As a result, Nissan will increase its investment in Sunderland, securing and sustaining the jobs of more than 7,000 workers at the plant. \u201cI am pleased to announce that Nissan will continue to invest in Sunderland. Our employees there continue to make the plant a globally competitive powerhouse, producing high-quality, high-value products every day,\u201d said Carlos Ghosn, Chairman and CEO of Nissan. \u201cThe support and assurances of the U.K. government enabled us to decide that the next-generation Qashqai and X-Trail will be produced at Sunderland. I welcome British Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s commitment to the automotive industry in Britain and to the development of an overall industrial strategy.\u201d Nissan\u2019s Sunderland plant opened in 1986 and has produced almost 9 million cars since. One in three British cars are produced in Sunderland, which is the UK\u2019s largest car plant of all time. In addition, 80% of production from Sunderland is exported to over 130 international markets. More than 2 million Qashqai\u2019s have been built in Sunderland in less than 10 years. In addition to the 7,000 direct employees at Sunderland, the plant supports a further 28,000 British automotive supply chain jobs. To date, Nissan has invested more than \u00a33.7 billion in Sunderland. Sunderland voted decisively to leave the EU back in June, by 61% to 39%. So Brexit voters may feel vindicated by Nissan\u2019s decision not to move Qashqai production abroad. Paul Brand of ITV tweets: Downing Street will be very pleased by Nissan\u2019s move, says City AM editor Christian May. Has Nissan managed to get the UK government to promise compensation, if the EU imposes tax barriers on car imports after Brexit? CEO Carlos Ghosn was pretty clear that he wanted protection from any new tariffs, once Britain leaves the European Union. After meeting Theresa May on October 14, Ghosn said: If there are tax barriers being established on cars, you have to have a commitment for car-makers who export to Europe that there is some kind of compensation. The BBC\u2019s Simon Jack says that Nissan has received \u201csupport and assurances\u201d from Theresa May\u2019s government, encouraging it to build the new Qashqai in Sunderland. The FT\u2019s Peter Campbell predicts an official announcement soon: Reuters are reporting that Nissan, the Japanese carmaker, has decided that it will build its next Qashqai SUV in Sunderland. That would be a significant boost for the region, and one of the first major investment decisions since June. The Nissan plant at Sunderland employs around 7,000 people, and is Britain\u2019s biggest car factory. Last week Nissan\u2019s chief executive Carlos Ghosn met prime minister Theresa May, and warned that his company could stop investing at Sunderland unless it was protected from any adverse impact from the Brexit vote. We\u2019ve called Nissan for comment..... Today\u2019s growth report shows that the \u201cBrexit bogeyman\u201d hasn\u2019t yet been as scary as initially feared, says Nancy Curtin, Chief Investment Officer at Close Brothers Asset Management. She writes: Any lingering concerns over an immediate collapse in growth in 2016 have been officially put to bed, with output continuing to grow in the first major assessment of domestic activity post-referendum. Supportive monetary policy has played a part, while the softer pound has kept factory orders ticking along. These, along with robust consumption, will be key levers of growth. But Curtin also predicts a slowdown next year: The quarter on quarter slowdown in the growth rate suggests Brexit uncertainty is having some bite, and it\u2019s likely the ambiguity around the UK\u2019s exit from the EU will take some of the steam out of the long-term growth rate, with anaemic growth likely to become status quo while Article 50 negotiations rumble on. I\u2019ve quickly truffled through today\u2019s GDP report to get some colour on how the UK economy performed 1) Services: The only sector to grow, by a punchy 0.8%. All four sub-sectors expanded (that\u2019s distribution, hotels and restaurants; transport, storage and communication; business services and finance; and government and other services). Growth was particularly strong in the \u201cmotion picture, video and TV programme production, sound recording and music publishing activities, and computer programming industries\u201d, apparent.y 2) Industrial production: It suffered a 0.4% contraction. That\u2019s mainly because manufacturing output shrank by a whole 1%. Energy supply fell by 3.6%, water and waste management dropped by 0.2%, while mining and quarrying increased by 5.2% 3) Construction: Output fell by 1.4%, which is the biggest decline since 2012. That\u2019s partly because construction of new housing fell, for the first time in a year. 4) Agriculture: Philip Hammond has also told the BBC that the UK economy is looking strong, as the EU exit talks loom: TUC general secretary Frances O\u2019Grady says the government needs to do more to help UK manufacturing (which contracted by 1% after the Brexit vote): \u201cWe can\u2019t yet say what impact Brexit will have on our economy, but these figures show there\u2019s no room for complacency. British manufacturing is still struggling, and now faces real uncertainty following the vote to leave the EU. \u201cThe government must use next month\u2019s Autumn Statement to boost Britain\u2019s jobs and wages. This means investing in infrastructure like roads, rail and homes, and raising the national minimum wage.\u201d Today\u2019s GDP report is an important measure of the health of Britain\u2019s economy after June\u2019s historic referendum. But several economists say the real test of the Brexit vote will come in 2017, not today. Here\u2019s PwC\u2019s Andrew Sentance: Geoffrey Yu, head of UK Investment Office at UBS Wealth Management, predicts that growth will keep slowing: Anecdotal evidence supports the view that we\u2019re yet to see any meaningful damage as a result of the Brexit vote, at least in the short-term. \u201cOf course, we should not overlook the lingering sense of uncertainty. Though the economy has fared better than initially feared, we expect that economic growth will slow down relative to the early part of this year. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at the international payments company World First, says we\u2019ll have a better picture once Theresa May has triggered article 50: \u201cWe have called the UK consumer a hardy beast in the past and in Q3 the beast was back. The services sector singlehandedly drove growth to a 15th consecutive positive quarter and while the \u2018little evidence of a pronounced effect\u2019 from the Brexit vote is being seen yet, we think that it will be as gradually obvious as the year comes to an end. The beast will tire as inflation fires arrows at its increasingly weakening hide.\u201d Thomas Laskey of Aberdeen Asset Management argues that the Bank of England should get some credit for today\u2019s growth report: \u201cThe data shows that the UK economy fared well in the aftermath of the EU referendum. It confirms what most investors thought: that sentiment bounced back after the initial shock of the result. Growth was fairly strong, at least in part because the Bank of England restarted its bond buying programme and the fact that changes to investment plans take time to play out. But he predicts slower growth next year: \u201cThe outlooks for growth is pretty uncertain. Brexit has the potential to be extremely costly to the UK and the country could be poorer as a result. We\u2019ve already seen this reflected in sterling\u2019s dramatic drop. Growth will probably slow as import costs increase and people\u2019s incomes fall as inflation rises. We are not out of the woods yet by any means.\u201d You can see the GDP report online, here: Gross Domestic Product, preliminary estimate: July to Sept 2016 Chancellor Philip Hammond says today\u2019s report shows that the UK economy is resilient, and \u2018well-placed\u2019 to deal with the challenges and opportunities created by the EU referendum. We are moving into a period of negotiations with the EU and we are determined to get the very best deal for households and businesses. The economy will need to adjust to a new relationship with the EU, but we are well-placed to deal with the challenges and take advantage of opportunities ahead.\u201d Anyone remember George Osborne\u2019s plan to rebalance the economy and create a March of the Makers? Five year\u2019s later, Britain is as dependent on service sector growth as ever: Britain\u2019s economy has now grown for 15 quarters in a row, and is 8.2% higher than the pre-economic downturn peak in early 2008. Today\u2019s report shows that Britain has not suffered a Brexit shock, according to Joe Grice, head of the Office for National Statistics. Grice says: There is little evidence of a pronounced effect in the immediate aftermath of the vote\u201d The pound has rallied a little, to $1.225, as traders welcome the GDP report. Britain\u2019s service sector, which makes up three quarters of the economy, is the only part which grew in the last three months. Service sector output grew by 0.8% in July-September. Construction shrank by 1.4% Agriculture shrank bu 0.7% Industrial production shrank by 0.4% And manufacturing (part of production) shrank by 1% At first glance, this report suggests that the UK economy has shrugged off the immediate shock of the EU referendum. It has grown faster than predicted in the gloomier forecasts ahead of June\u2019s vote. Remember, the Treasury said the economy would shrink by 0.1% after a Brexit vote. On an annual basis, the UK economy grew by 2.3% during the last quarter. Again, that\u2019s stronger than expected. HERE WE GO! Britain\u2019s economy grew by 0.5% in the three months after the Brexit vote. That\u2019s down from 0.7% in the second quarter of 2016, showing that growth has slowed. But it\u2019s also stronger than the 0.3% which economists has expected. More to follow! The pound has risen back to $1.224... Tension is building, with just four minutes until we learn how the UK economy performed after the EU referendum.... Back in April, the Treasury claimed that the economy would shrink by 0.1% for four quarters in a row, if Britain voted to leave the EU. Today\u2019s GDP report is the first test of that assessment.... [UPDATE: This forecast may have assumed Britain had triggered Article 50 immediately after the referendum]. A flash of good news from Madrid: the Spanish unemployment rate hit its lowest level since 2009 in the last quarter. But it\u2019s still 18.9%, despite a surge in summer hiring to handle the tourist trade. Economist Rupert Seggins has tweeted a nice graph, showing how uncertainty spiked after the referendum,but has been dropping to less jittery levels since. Today\u2019s Q3 growth report is only \u2018preliminary\u2019, as it\u2019s mainly based on data from July and August. That makes it harder to predict, says Jeremy Cook of World First: Surveys are suggesting a number between 0.1% and 0.4% with consensus estimates looking for a figure of around 0.3% but this is the muddiest figure we will have seen in a while given the collapse in expectations in July and the rebound in August. Manufacturing may be optimistic but services are not sharing in that joy. The pound has dropped by almost half a cent this morning, to $1.2202, as traders await the UK GDP report. Just 45 minutes until we get the UK GDP report for the last quarter! Bloomberg\u2019s Maxime Sbaihi predicts it will get a mixed reception: Although the City consensus is that UK growth fell to 0.3% in the last quarter, some forecasts are plumping for a rosier +0.4%. Ross Finley of Reuters has the details: HSBC are in the camp predicting that UK growth dipped to 0.3% in the last three months. But they aren\u2019t ruling out a higher figure, saying: \u201cThe U.K. economy has held up in Q3, defying expectations of a pronounced uncertainty-driven slowdown following the referendum. Given fairly robust indicators, our forecast is for growth of 0.3% qoq, with risks to the upside.\u201d Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, has warned that the uncertainty over Brexit is bad for the economy. Speaking on Bloomberg, Lagarde says firms want to know whether London-based banks will lose their rights to \u2018passport\u2019 services across the EU single market. Britain\u2019s future trade deals are another question mark, making it harder for companies to invest and create jobs. This uncertainty is \u201cnot healthy\u201d, says Lagarde. But she does welcome the government\u2019s commitment to trigger article 50 by the end of March 2017. One thing we know now is the timetable. So for the next two and a half years nothing changes, but everything is changed. Don\u2019t get too excited if today\u2019s GDP report shows that the economy is still growing, says Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index. She predicts that consumer spending will provide the bulk of the growth in the last quarter, as industry and construction struggles over the summer Industrial production has fallen sharply in recent months; it fell by 0.4% in August. Construction is facing a steeper decline, the latest Office for National Statistics data on construction output has fallen 2% since June. In contrast, the service sector PMI bounced back after a sharp decline in service sector sentiment in July. We expect this pattern to be repeated in the Q3 GDP report. And Brooks also fears that 2017 will be tough, as higher inflation eats into real wages. The Bank of England has slashed its growth forecasts for 2017 to a mere 0.8%, compared with 2.2% for 2016. Consultancy firm PWC is forecasting a gloomier outcome at 0.6% for 2017. The biggest risk for UK growth is a sharp slowdown in business investment that could become more pronounced in the coming months, once the UK government has triggered Article 50. If the UK looks set to lose its access to the single market, then we may see the consumer show signs of stress, which could knock the UK economy seriously off course, and potentially plunge us into recession. Today\u2019s GDP figures are the most eagerly awaited since the British economy returned to growth four years ago. Eric Lascelles, chief economist at RBC Global Asset Management, says. \u201cThis is an extremely high stakes report \u2013 the British economy appears to have been surprisingly resilient to the Brexit upset. \u201cTo be clear, some economic damage is still expected, if not of a recession-inducing magnitude.\u201d That\u2019s via Bloomberg, who reckon the report will \u201cswing the mood of consumers and provide a tool for politicians pushing their view on how tough to be when it comes to actually removing the U.K. from the EU\u201d. Good morning. We\u2019re about to find out how well, or badly, Britain\u2019s economy fared in the immediate aftermath of June\u2019s historic vote to quit the European Union. At 9.30am, the Office for National Statistics will whip the official growth figures for the third quarter of this year out of its hat. And we\u2019re expecting to learn that the economy slowed sharply in the July to September quarter. But, GDP probably didn\u2019t go into reverse, despite fears that a Brexit vote would trigger an immediate recession. Economists predict that the quarterly growth rate probably slowed to around 0.3%, or perhaps 0.4%, down from a healthier 0.7% in the April-June quarter. That would mean that Britain\u2019s economy has been growing for 15th consecutive quarters. The breakdown of the GDP report will also show how the service sector, manufacturers and construction firms all fared during the last quarter. The figures are likely to shift the pound, and move the stock markets, especially if growth is markedly stronger or weaker than the City expects. Other data released since June has suggested that the economy has taken the uncertainty pretty well, with the unemployment rate sticking at 4.9% and consumer spending resilient. As RBC Capital Markets put it: It does seem that the impact of the referendum won\u2019t have been as immediate as we and many others had initially expected. But, the true impact of Brexit will be seen over years, of course, not months, as Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit tweets: GDP is obviously the main event. But we\u2019ll also keep an eye on financial results from Barclays and Deutsche Bank, plus cider maker C&amp;C, retailer Debenhams and telecoms group BT.",

          "bodyText": "The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has cancelled a trip to Brussels amid ongoing struggles to rescue a landmark trade deal between his country and the European Union. Trudeau was due to meet the EU leaders Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker in Brussels on Thursday, but decided at the last minute not to get on the plane as Belgian politicians continued to wrangle over the agreement, preventing the EU side from signing it. An EU source confirmed to the Guardian that the summit would not go ahead. No new date has been set. \u201cThe Canadian delegation will not be travelling to Europe tonight,\u201d a press secretary for the Canadian trade minister, Chrystia Freeland, told Global News. \u201cCanada remains ready to sign this important agreement when Europe is ready.\u201d Trudeau had been expected to fly to the Belgian capital on Wednesday night as part of a delegation including Freeland and the foreign affairs minister, St\u00e9phane Dion. The comprehensive economic and trade agreement (Ceta), which has been seven years in the making, has stumbled near the finish line owing to strong opposition from the Belgian regional parliament of Wallonia. The EU requires all 28 member states to support Ceta for the treaty to come into force, but the Belgian federal government, which supports the agreement, has been unable to give its consent because of opposition from regional parliaments in Wallonia and Brussels. Crisis talks between Belgium\u2019s different regional leaders were continuing on Thursday, but politicians have struggled to patch up their differences. Hopes of a compromise rose late on Wednesday evening as a committee of Belgium\u2019s regional leaders discussed a compromise text. Paul Magnette, Wallonia\u2019s minister president, declined to sign the agreement, citing \u201ctechnical questions\u201d. Magnette is backed by his Socialist colleagues and the centre-right Christian Democrats in Wallonia. \u201cWhat guides us is the defence of important values: cultural identity at the European level, defending farmers, small and medium-sized enterprises, the precautionary principle,\u201d the francophone Christian Democrat president, Beno\u00eet Lutgen, told the TV station RTBF. \u201cWhat does it matter if there is a summit tomorrow, in three days or six weeks? It doesn\u2019t change anything in my eyes. \u201cWe have managed to obtain transparency. That is already very important, not only for Walloon citizens, but also for Belgian citizens and even European citizens.\u201d The decision to postpone the summit will be a blow to Tusk, the European council president. As late as Wednesday morning he thought it would be possible for the long-planned meeting to go ahead and urged Belgium to live up to its reputation as \u201cconsensus-building champion\u201d. The row has reignited long-standing tensions between Wallonia, a region that has struggled with a legacy of industrial decline and high unemployment, and its wealthier neighbour Flanders, which does more trade with Canada. It has also called into question the EU\u2019s ability to sign trade deals and raised questions about the prospects for post-Brexit Britain in negotiating its own agreement. The European commission has always sought unanimity among EU member states on trade deals, but critics say it made a tactical error by giving national parliaments an effective veto over the Canada deal. Even if Belgians live up to their reputation for crafting a compromise, the Ceta agreement will only come into force on a temporary basis. To become a permanent and complete agreement, Ceta must also be ratified by 28 national parliaments and 10 other regional assemblies and upper houses. Britain\u2019s secretary of state for international trade, Liam Fox, told MPs on Wednesday that the difficulties over Ceta underlined the importance of the UK signing a trade deal before it leaves the EU. The UK would only face a procedure similar to Ceta, he said, if it failed to conclude a trade agreement before the end of two years of divorce negotiations under the EU\u2019s article 50. \u201cThat sort of procedure would only be undertaken were we to leave the European Union after our article 50 period without any agreement whatsoever and were looking to seek a new FTA [free-trade agreement] from outside,\u201d he said. Some observers think that is a likely prospect, as the article 50 divorce talks are dedicated to unwinding Britain\u2019s EU membership and European leaders will not sign a trade deal before agreeing the divorce settlement. Fox, a prominent leave campaigner, said the experience of Ceta might cause some to think twice before seeking a trade agreement with the EU. \u201cThose who put politics ahead of prosperity might want to think twice,\u201d he said.",

          "bodyText": "Activists have called on Canadian leaders to introduce concrete policies to confront discrimination against women and girls after the country fell from first to 25th in the United Nation\u2019s gender equality ranking. The criticism comes as the United Nations holds its 65th annual meeting to eliminate gender discrimination, and just a few months after the country\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, was praised for a speech to the UN in New York, where he said, \u201cI am a feminist.\u201d \u201cCanada fails to respect, protect and fulfill the social and economic rights of women and girls,\u201d a group of 14 non-profit organizations said in a statement. \u201cToo many women in Canada experience poverty, homelessness, insecure housing, woefully inadequate social assistance incomes, food insecurity and other violations of the right to an adequate standard of living.\u201d The groups, which include Amnesty International, the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada and Oxfam, pointed to Trudeau\u2019s comments on gender equality and his pledges to improve relations with the country\u2019s indigenous population. \u201cCanada has a new federal government with a Prime Minister who says he is a feminist, calls for a nation-to-nation relationship, and acknowledges that \u2018poverty is sexist\u2019. We know words matter, but now we need action,\u201d the statement said. Historically, the United Nations\u2019 work toward gender equality has included an annual Gender Inequality Index, an international ranking in which Canada has steadily fallen. In 1995, Canada held the top spot, but has fallen to 25th over the last 20 years. The report includes data on reproductive health, empowerment and economic inclusion. The GII uses maternal death rates and teen pregnancy, the number of women who hold national elected office and have secondary education, and participation in the labor market to weigh countries\u2019 progress toward equality. In their criticism of Canada, the groups said they were \u201cconcerned\u201d about access to abortion, \u201cparticularly in rural and northern areas\u201d, and said they were dismayed by the country\u2019s continued wage gap between the sexes and even between women. \u201cWe\u2019re looking to the new government that\u2019s taken over, who has made lots of promises around women\u2019s equality,\u201d said Kasari Govender, executive director of the West Coast Women\u2019s Legal Education and Action Fund (Leaf). \u201cAre they actually going to truly act on the damage that has been done over the last couple decades that have eroded women\u2019s equality?\u201d Govender pointed to what she said was a 12% wage disparity between women with children and those without, what she called a \u201cmotherhood tax\u201d, as well as difficulties women face finding childcare. The groups were especially critical of the Canadian government\u2019s failure to serve the needs of indigenous women. \u201cIndigenous women and girls in Canada suffer some of the world\u2019s highest suicide rates, overrepresentation in prison and high rates of sexualized violence,\u201d said Professor Pam Palmater, chair of indigenous governance at Ryerson University. \u201cThese conditions are brought on by years of colonization, theft of lands and resources, discriminatory state legislation, chronic underfunding of critical social programs like water, food, housing, health and education and the theft of children into foster care.\u201d After his election in 2015, Trudeau won praise for naming a cabinet with equal numbers of men and women \u2013 the first time in Canada\u2019s history.

          "bodyText": "Crude prices are under pressure again after Iraq said it wanted to be exempt from any agreement by Opec to cut production. Markets had been hoping a meeting next month by producers would agree an output deal to support the sliding oil price. Opec announced plans last month to cut output, but details of how it would reach this target and how much individual producer countries would cut were expected at a meeting in Vienna in November. But comments from Iraq over the weekend added to the general uncertainty as to whether any agreement could be reached after all. Brent crude is currently down just over 2% at $50.71 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate is the same amount lower at $49.78. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, does not seem to have given up yet on an EU-Canada trade deal: Here\u2019s our report on the latest developments in the EU-Canada trade deal. Jennifer Rankin writes: The European Union\u2019s hopes of signing a free-trade agreement with Canada this week appear to have gone up in smoke, after Belgium announced it could not sign the treaty because of opposition from regional parliaments. The collapse of the talks highlights the pitfalls that may await the British government when it seeks to negotiate a trade deal with the EU after Brexit. The Belgian prime minister, Charles Michel, announced on Monday that Belgium was not ready to sign the EU-Canada trade pact, following emergency talks between the country\u2019s federal and regional leaders. The Belgian stalemate means Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, is expected to postpone a trip to Brussels this Thursday, when he was due to sign the treaty. Officials are assessing how the trade pact can be revived, but next steps remained unclear. Donald Tusk, the head of the European council, is due to speak to Trudeau later on Monday. Tusk had given Belgium an ultimatum of Monday night to sort out its problems, but emergency talks in Brussels in the afternoon showed the treaty remained stuck. Paul Magnette, Wallonia\u2019s minister-president, who has led opposition to the deal, said his position had not changed. He had failed to show up for crisis talks with the European commission on Sunday, according to Michel. The full report is here: A spate of takeover deals, notably AT&amp;T\u2019s \u00a370bn offer for Time Warner, and better than expected eurozone and US manufacturing PMIs have lifted most markets at the start of the trading week. But, partly due to mixed UK factory orders, the FTSE 100 has failed to hold on to early gains, and ended below the 7000 level. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: The FTSE\u2019s early gains have turned to ashes, with the index falling into the red over the course of the afternoon. Both the US and Europe have trimmed their gains, but the fall for London\u2019s chief index is the standout feature of the day. Now that the pound has stopped its freefall (for now at least), perhaps the index as a whole is beginning to look a tad overpriced. Certainly, it has shown little inclination to get back to its recent highs, with ongoing Brexit uncertainty making the UK less attractive versus a eurozone economy that appears, on the basis of today\u2019s PMI numbers, to be looking much more attractive. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 34.07 points or 0.49% at 6986.40 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.47% to 10,761.17 France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.36% to 4552.58 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB was up 0.81% to 17,305.77 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.27% better at 9216.2 In Greece, the Athens market dipped 0.15% to 593.13 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 76 points or 0.42%. Meanwhile the pound is down 0.25% at $1.22 and a similar amount lower against the euro at \u20ac1.1206. UK prime minister Theresa May has said she is disappointed with developments in the EU-Canada trade deal. Speaking in parliament she said: \u201cI share everyone\u2019s disappointment in the stalled talks between the EU and Canada.\u201d But she said the problems would not have a bearing on the UK\u2019s own negotiations about leaving the European Union, saying the UK was not seeking to replicate an existing model but build its own. More on the prime minister in parliament in the politics live blog: Most stock markets continue to move higher, with the FTSE 100 the notable exception. Helped by M&amp;A deals and better than expected manufacturing data for October, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up around 0.47% while in Europe Germany\u2019s Dax is 0.8% higher and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.65%. But after an early increase the FTSE 100 has fallen by 0.37% and is now back below the 7000 level in the wake of mixed data from the CBI. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The markets [are] continuing to be propelled by the day\u2019s better than expected PMI readings. The US was the latest to chip in with a decent manufacturing release this Monday, the flash figure coming in at an 11 month high of 53.2 against the 51.6 forecast. This ended up helping out both the dollar and the Dow Jones; the former took 0.1% off the pound, while the latter jumped nearly 100 points after the bell to approach 18250. Over in the Eurozone the DAX and CAC held onto their morning growth, the German and French indices rising 0.9% and 0.8% respectively. The FTSE, meanwhile, remained the Western anomaly, slipping by 0.2% as investors continued to react to this morning\u2019s troublesome CBI industrial order expectations slide. More from Reuters on Belgium\u2019s failure to agree the EU-Canada trade deal: \u201cWe cannot give a yes,\u201d Paul Magnette, the premier of the Wallonia region, told reporters as he emerged. He said the main problems remained not with Ottawa, which has already agreed to modifications in the deal, but with the EU authorities. Other Socialist-led regions, including bilingual capital Brussels, are ranged behind the Walloons, while Dutch- and German-speakers back Michel\u2019s liberal-led federal coalition: \u201cWe have a Yes from the federal, Flemish and German-speaking communities and it\u2019s a No from the others,\u201d said Flanders premier Geert Bourgeois after the meeting at Michel\u2019s residence lasting less than an hour. \u201cIt\u2019s a real shame,\u201d the center-right leader said. \u201cWe\u2019re the laughing stock of the whole world. It\u2019s bad for Wallonia, for Flanders, for Belgium, for Europe, for the whole world.\u201d Michel said it was too early to say Ceta was dead and that the Walloons and he were still open to dialogue but that he must inform Tusk that Belgium was not in a position to consent now to a deal that all 27 other EU member states are ready to support... Ceta supporters say it would increase trade between the partners by 20 percent and boost the EU economy by 12 billion euros ($13 billion) a year and Canada\u2019s by C$12 billion (US $9 billion). Walloons have concerns about the threat of surging pork and beef imports from Canada and an independent court system to settle disputes between states and foreign investors, which critics say allows multinationals to dictate public policy. Many EU leaders suspect the local government in Namur is using its devolved powers to play domestic politics. Dutch language Flemish newspaper De Morgen said on Monday that the Magnette\u2019s stance was both a matter of principle and opportunism, a chance to boost his reputation and to become leader of the center-left in Belgium. Strong domestic demand is one key factor behind the better than expected US PMI figures, according to IHS Markit chief business economist Chris Williamson. He said: Manufacturing showed further signs of pulling out of the malaise seen earlier in the year, starting the fourth quarter on a solid footing. Both output and new orders are rising at the fastest rates for a year amid increasingly widespread optimism that demand will pick up again after the presidential election, which has been commonly cited as a key factor that has subdued spending and investment in recent months. There are also signs that the drag from cost-cutting policies of deliberate inventory reduction is moving into reverse. Inventory-building should therefore provide an extra boost to the economy in the fourth quarter. Weak export growth, attributable to the strong dollar, and lacklustre hiring remain big areas of disappointment, and highlight an ongoing dependency on domestic demand and a need to keep labour costs low amid a still-uncertain economic and political outlook. More signs of strength in the US economy. The Market US manfacturing PMI for October has come in at 53.2, well above the 51.5 expected by analysts. It compares to final figure for September of 51.5. This is the highest manufacturing PMI figure since October 2015. The better than expected figure adds to the idea that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates before the end of the year, pushing the dollar higher and US Treasury bond prices lower. Merger Monday has given US stock markets an early lift, ahead of a spate of major results later in the week, including from Apple and Boeing. AT&amp;T\u2019s \u00a370bn offer for Time Warner is not the only deal on the table. Broker TD Ameritrade plans to pay $4bn for Scottrade Financial Services, while aircraft component maker Rockwell Collins is offering $6.4bn for B/E Aerospace. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 114 points or 0.6% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.45% higher and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.64%. Bullard also said: The St. Louis Fed\u2019s conclusion is that a single 25-basis-point increase in the policy rate\u2013from 38 to 63 basis points\u2013will get us very close to the Taylor rule value over the forecast horizon. [The Taylor rule provides a recommended setting for the FOMC\u2019s policy rate based on current values of observable macroeconomic variables, according to Bullard] Ahead of the latest US manufacturing data for October, a Federal Reserve member has repeated his belief that one further interest rate rise is all that is necessary for the moment. St Louis Federal Reserve president James Bullard told a conference in Arkansas: The current policy rate setting is just 38 basis points, extraordinarily low by postwar historical standards. The Federal Open Markets Committee is considering raising the policy rate to a somewhat higher level, [but] the St. Louis Fed\u2019s rate path projection is much flatter than the rest of the Committee. The bottom line: Low interest rates are likely to continue to be the norm over the next two to three years. Hopes that Belgium would back a European Union trade deal with Canada appear to have been dashed, putting the agreement in jeopardy. Belgian prime minister Charles Michel said he had told EC president Donald Tusk today that the country could not sign the deal because he had failed to get agreement from regional authorities, notably Wallonia. The EU had given Belgium\u2019s federal government until late on Monday to secure backing for a deal, or a summit to sign the Ceta agreement planned for Thursday would be cancelled. But according to Reuters, Michel said to reporters after meeting regional leaders: I have officially told Tusk that we have no agreement. He said he was still open to further talks with Wallonia and said it was too early to say whether Ceta, which has been in negotiations for several years, was dead. But Tusk is now expected to contact Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and call off Thursday\u2019s planned summit. The omens had not looked good ahead of the meeting between Michel and the leaders of five regional authorities , with Wallonia\u2019s premier Paul Magnette criticising the deadline placed on the deal. He said (quote from Reuters): Every time you try to put an ultimatum it makes a calm debate and a democratic debate impossible.. We don\u2019t need an ultimatum. We will not decide anything under an ultimatum or under pressure. Magnette says the deal is bad for Europe\u2019s farmers and gives too much power to global corporate interests. The latest Guardian Brexit dashboard has just been released, and it shows that Britain\u2019s economy is starting to lose momentum as the impact of June\u2019s referendum is felt. The dashboard is a comprehensive assessment of conditions in the UK economy, and it highlights that living standards are being squeezed as the slump in sterling hits people in the pocket. My colleague Angela Monaghan explains: The dashboard for October shows that four of the eight categories have performed worse than expected, two were as expected, and two were better. Inflation jumped more sharply than expected to 1%, the highest level in almost two years, Britain\u2019s trade deficit with the rest of the world widened, as growth in imports rose faster than exports, and retail sales were flat as shoppers were put off by higher clothing prices and exceptionally warm September. Here\u2019s the story: Economist Danny Blanchflower fears that Britain is facing an \u201concoming Brexit tsunami\u201d, while PwC\u2019s Andrew Sentance is more positive. Here are their takes: And you can see the full dashboard here: Here\u2019s a recent-ish photo of Cyrus Mistry: Cyrus Mistry\u2019s shock exit from Tata today is causing a real stir. My colleague Graham Ruddick says it has implications for steelworkers in South Wales, whose future has been in doubt since Tata announced plans to sell, or shut, it. The Economist\u2019s Stanley Pignal reckons Mistry paid the price for Tata\u2019s recent struggles. Now this is interesting... Tata, the Indian manufacturing giant, has just announced the departure of its chairman, Cyrus Mistry. Ratan Tata, who ran the company for two decades, is stepping in while a permanent successor is found. In a brief statement, Tata says: Tata Sons today announced that its Board has replaced Mr. Cyrus P. Mistry as Chairman of Tata Sons. The decision was taken at a Board meeting held here today. The Board has named Mr. Ratan N. Tata as Interim Chairman of Tata Sons. The Board has constituted a Selection Committee to choose a new Chairman. The Committee comprises Mr. Ratan N. Tata, Mr. Venu Srinivasan, Mr. Amit Chandra, Mr. Ronen Sen and Lord Kumar Bhattacharyya, as per the criteria in the Articles of Association of Tata Sons. The committee has been mandated to complete the selection process in four months. It\u2019s not immediately clear why Mistry is off, but Tata\u2019s somewhat-sprawling operations have been struggling to keep pace with rivals. The group is involved in steel, automobiles, consultancy, power, and mobile telecoms.... Bang on cue, AT&amp;T and Time Warner are defending their merger (which they claim is a \u201cperfect match\u201d) The US stock market is expected to follow Europe\u2019s lead, and open higher today. The benchmark S&amp;P 500 index is tipped to jump by 0.5% when trading begins (at 2.30pm BST). AT&amp;T\u2019s plan to acquire Time Warner for $85bn has given Wall Street a dose of merger fever, even though the deal has been criticised by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, and Democratic vice-presidential pick Tim Kaine: Some reaction to Microsoft\u2019s Brexit price hike: Brexit may mean Brexit, but it also means businesses paying a lot more for using Microsoft\u2019s products. The tech giant is hiking the cost of its enterprise software, by up to 22%, in response to the slump in the pound since June\u2019s referendum. It starts in January. As my colleague Alex Hern points out, other technology products and services have also spiked in cost recently: Newsflash: UK factories have suffered a fall in industrial orders this month. The CBI\u2019s monthly survey of manufacturers shows that the balance of orders fell to -17 this month, down from -6 in September. That suggests that factories are finding things a bit tougher this month. But... they\u2019re also more upbeat about future prospects. The CBI\u2019s business optimism index has risen to -8, from a positively gloomy -47 in September. And the balance of firms reporting higher exports rose to +8 over the last three months. Perhaps the most interesting line is that the weak pound isn\u2019t being cheered too loudly. Almost half the exporters surveyed said the fall in sterling was bad for their business (even though it should make their products more attractive in foreign markets). Today\u2019s report shows that the prices paid by UK factories for their materials jumped at the fastest rate in three years, and are expected to continue growing at above their long-term average over the quarter ahead. Rain Newton-Smith, CBI chief economist, says: \u201cManufacturers\u2019 are optimistic about export prospects and export orders are growing, following the fall in Sterling. \u201cHowever, the weaker Pound is also feeding through to costs, which are rising briskly and may well spill over into higher consumer prices in the months ahead. Back in the City, shares in UK defence firm Cobham have slumped by 17% this morning after it hit investors with its second profit warning in six months. Cobham is languishing at the bottom of the FSTE 250 leaderboard, after it warned that revenues and profits continue to miss expectations. More here: Eurozone investors are also cheered by political developments in Spain, where right-wing leader Mariano Rajoy has the green light to form another administration. After 10 months of deadlock, Spain\u2019s socialist party has decided not to oppose a confidence vote, meaning Rajoy should be clear to form a minority government. The move is unpopular with some left-wing politicians, who feel they shouldn\u2019t prop up Rajoy\u2019s PP party (which is facing a flurry of corruption charges). But the prospect of a stable government in Madrid, after two inconclusive elections, is encouraging traders to buy Spanish debt. This is driving down Spain\u2019s bond yields, meaning it can borrow at cheaper rates: The euro is struggling back from its lowest level in seven months. The single currency is hovering around $1.089, having earlier fallen as low as $1.086 - its weakest point since the EU referendum. The pound is little changed this morning, at $1.224 against the dollar. Caxton FX analyst Alexandra Russell-Oliver explains: Expectations that the Fed will move on interest rates by the end of the year, likely in December, have contributed to dollar strength. The euro remains relatively under pressure in light of ongoing stimulus from the European Central Bank. The pound continues to be driven by ongoing Brexit uncertainty ahead of the triggering of Article 50 by next March, particularly concerns that the UK will pursue a \u201chard\u201d Brexit. Today\u2019s PMI report also shows that eurozone firms are hiking prices this month, for the first time in over a year. Markit says: With demand firming, companies were increasingly able to charge higher rates to customers. Average prices charged for goods and services rose for the first time since August 2015. Higher prices were often a reflection of the need to pass rising costs on to customers. Average input costs increased at the steepest rate for 15 months, linked mainly to higher commodity prices, notably oil-related, as well as rising wage costs. October\u2019s \u2018flash\u2019 PMIs suggest the eurozone is growing at a quarterly rate of around 0.4%, says Markit. That would beat the 0.3% recorded between April and June, but is still rather unspectacular. Dutch financial blogger Jeroen Blokland believes that today\u2019s PMI survey shows the European Central Bank should start reining in its stimulus programme: The ECB\u2019s QE programme is due to run out next March. Last week, president Mario Draghi hinted that it could be extended, perhaps in December. Here\u2019s economist Marcus Wright on today\u2019s PMI report: Here\u2019s Julien Lafargue, European equities strategist at JP Morgan, on today\u2019s healthcheck on the eurozone economy: According to the flash PMIs estimates, after a difficult summer, the Eurozone is accelerating again at the start of the 4th quarter. The improvement in Services in Germany is particularly encouraging as this had been an area of concerns recently. The focus is now likely to switch to inflation dynamics with input costs in Germany rising at the fastest pace in nearly 1.5 years and backlogs of work in the Eurozone accumulating at the fastest rate for over 5 years. Although we believe this would be premature, this might trigger renewed concerns about the ECB having to \u201ctaper\u201d its quantitative easing in the coming months. [Tapering = cutting the size of the European Central Bank\u2019s stimulus programme, which is currently buying \u20ac80bn of new bonds each month] Boom! Eurozone companies are growing at their fastest rate this year, as they put the shock of Britain\u2019s Brexit vote behind them. Firms are benefitting from a surge in new orders, encouraging them to take on more staff to deal with a growing backlog of work. That\u2019s the message from Markit\u2019s monthly healthcheck on the eurozone economy, just released. Markit\u2019s flash composite Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index, which measures activity in the sector, has jumped to 53.7 from September\u2019s 52.6. That\u2019s the highest reading since December 2015, and much stronger than expected. Here are the details: As we covered earlier, Germany\u2019s PMI hit a three month high this week, while France\u2019s factories have made a welcome (and long-awaited) return to growth. The eurozone\u2019s manufacturing and service sectors both posted a rise in new output, at the highest rate since the start of this year. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, says the future looks quite bright: \u201cThe eurozone economy showed renewed signs of life at the start of the fourth quarter, enjoying its strongest expansion so far this year with the promise of more to come. With backlogs of work accumulating at the fastest rate for over five years, business activity growth and hiring look set to accelerate further as we head towards the end of the year. \u201cOctober\u2019s PMI is consistent with a quarterly GDP growth rate of 0.4%, led by a 0.5% pace of expansion in Germany. Modest growth of 0.2-0.3% is being signalled for France, but there are various indicators which suggest that France will enjoy stronger growth in coming months, including a marked build-up of uncompleted work. More to follow.... Some early reaction: This is from Fred Ducrozet of Swiss bank Pictet: And here\u2019s Bloomberg\u2019s Maxime Sbaihi: European stock markets are rallying in early trading, led by France after its factory sector returned to growth. The French CAC has gained 0.65%, while in London the FTSE 100 is up 44 points, or 0.6%, at 7064. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx says: Finally crawling out of contraction territory the French manufacturing PMI hit a 10 month high of 51.3 this morning; the services sector wasn\u2019t so strong, however, slipping from 53.3 (revised down from 54.1) to 52.1 month-on-month. Germany, meanwhile, beat estimates on both counts; its manufacturing PMI came in at a 32 month peak of 55.1, with the services reading at a 3 month high of 54.1. This allowed the DAX and CAC to post some decent gains this Monday, rising 0.7% and 0.8% respectively. German companies have also beaten expectations, reporting their strongest growth in three months. Markit\u2019s Flash Germany Composite Output Index has jumped to 55.1 in October, up from September\u2019s 16-month low of 52.8. Factories reported their biggest leap in activity in almost three years, while service sector firms also picked up. That suggests Germany\u2019s private sector has put its recent slowdown behind it. Firms also reported that new orders grew at their fastest rate this year Oliver Kolodseike, Economist at IHS Markit said: \u201cThe German economy has entered the fast lane again at the start of the fourth quarter, with output growth accelerating from September\u2019s recent low. The improvement in the PMI in October lifts hopes that the weaker expansions we have seen in the past two months were just a temporary soft patch, rather than the beginning of a serious slowdown. Encouragingly, French business expectations have strengthened this month, with more bosses planning to spend more on advertising and new projects: Markit says: Some panellists were buoyed by the latest increases in demand, while planned rises in investment and marketing were expected to boost overall activity. Less encouragingly, French firms are still cutting staff: On the employment front, staffing levels were marginally lower for the fifth time in 2016 so far. Both manufacturing and services sectors recorded slight drops in employment, although the fall in manufacturing was the lowest recorded in eight months of job shedding. Here\u2019s Markit\u2019s snap summary of the French PMIs: France\u2019s manufacturing sector has given the markets an early-morning lift, by reporting that they\u2019ve posted their strongest growth this year. Factory output has hit its fastest rate since March 2014 this month, raising hopes that the eurozone\u2019s second-largest economy is picking up. This pushed the \u2018flash\u2019 French manufacturing PMI, produced by Markit, up to 51.5 in October, from 49.7 in September. That\u2019s a 10-month high, ending a long run of contraction. Any reading over 50 shows growth, so this indicates that French factories are enjoyinga decent enough autumn. However.... service sector growth slowed to a three-month low; meaning the \u2018composite PMI\u2019 actually dipped a little, to 52.2 from 52.7. Paul Smith, senior economist at IHS Markit, says the data is encouraging: \u201cAlthough growth slipped slightly in October, the latest data revealed a number of positives for the French economy, especially on the manufacturing side with rising exports supporting a marked uplift in output. With signs of intensifying capacity pressures and service providers indicating expectations for near-term growth, the outlook for the rest of 2016 looks reasonably positive.\u201d Next up, German PMI..... There\u2019s relief in the eurozone today, after Portugal successfully held onto its investment-grade credit rating on Friday night. There had been fears that rating agency DBRS would slash Portugal\u2019s credit rating in to junk territory, which would have had serious consequences for. But instead, DBRS maintained Lisbon\u2019s BBB rating with a \u201cstable\u201d outlook, despite earlier expressing concerns over low growth and high debt. That has sent Portugal\u2019s bonds rallying this morning, driving down the yield on 10-year debt to a six-week low of just 3.08%. If Portugal had been downgraded by DBRS, it would no longer have been eligible for the European Central Bank\u2019s quantitative easing programme. That would have driven up borrowing costs, and raised fears that the eurozone crisis was heating up again. Portugal\u2019s government welcomed the move, saying: \u201cToday\u2019s decision increases our own and the markets\u2019 confidence in the policies chosen for the country.\u201d But.... Fitch, S&amp;P and Moody\u2019s have already slashed Portugal into junk territory, expressing fears over its slow growth rates and high public debt. So Lisbon isn\u2019t out of the woods yet. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s going to be a big week for economic data. On Thursday, we learn how the UK economy performed in the last three months, immediately after the Brexit vote. Economists expect growth to slow to 0.3% or 0.4%, from 0.7% in April. That\u2019s a significant slowdown, but not as bad as some forecasters had predicted during the referendum campaign. Kathleen Brooks of City Index says it would be: ...not bad considering the doom and gloom about the UK economy, some may say. However, there are a few signs that Brexit is starting to weigh on the UK economy. Business investment is expected to be weak, and we expect another quarter of growth heavily reliant on the consumer. Going forward, we see consumer confidence flagging once Article 50 is triggered at some point early in Q1 next year. Then on Friday, we get US GDP figures for the third quarter. Growth is expected to speed up, to around 0.6% quarter-on-quarter. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets explains: This is an immensely important week in terms of economic data and we may see some serious firecrackers which lightens up some bonfire. We could potentially see massive swings in the forex and equity markets as investors scrutinized the third quarter GDP number for the US economy which is due at the end of the week. What traders want to know is that if the US economy is regaining traction. There\u2019s not much UK economic news today, apart from the CBI\u2019s regular healthcheck on UK industry (published at 11am BST). We also get a flash view of the European economy from 8am to 9am, when the latest surveys of manufacturing and services companies in France, Germany, and the wider eurozone are released. And Bank of England deputy governor Minouche Shafik is giving a speech in Hong Kong about macroprudential policies.",

The collapse of the negotiations in Belgium highlights the pitfalls that may await the British government when it seeks to negotiate a trade deal with the EU after Brexit. The Belgian prime minister, Charles Michel, announced on Monday that Belgium was not ready to sign the EU-Canada trade pact, following emergency talks between the country\u2019s federal and regional leaders.

A spokesperson for the European commission, which is responsible for negotiating EU trade agreements, said it stood \u201cready to continue assisting whenever needed in this process\u201d. \u201cBelgium is still in the process of establishing its position through its relevant institutional procedures and in line with its constitutional order. We of course respect these. Patience is of the essence.\u201d The commission has suggested that talks will continue later in the year. \u201cThe commission does not tend to work with ultimatums or deadlines,\u201d the spokesperson said, in an implicit criticism of Tusk\u2019s approach. The problems nailing down a trade treaty with a close ally of Europe have put officials in deep gloom and raised doubts about future pacts with the US and China. Even if Belgium patches up its differences over Ceta, that would not be the end of the story. Following agreement among 28 governments, the trade treaty would come into force on a temporary basis. But it could only become a permanent legal text after ratification by 28 national parliaments and 10 regional assemblies and upper houses. Critics say the European commission, which is responsible for negotiating trade agreements, has ceded too much power to national parliaments. The growing role of national assemblies means that Belgium\u2019s German-speaking parliament, representing 76,000 people, could, in theory, block a trade agreement between the EU and the UK. British officials have played down similarities, arguing that putting up trade barriers will be a very different exercise to taking them down. Chris Grayling, a pro-leave minister, has said he does not fear a veto from the Walloon parliament because Britain buys \u201ca whole load of produce from Walloon farmers\u201d and tariffs would not be in their interest. That optimism appeared to be given some credibility by Merkel, who suggested on Friday that she did not see a parallel between Ceta and future talks with the UK.",

          "bodyText": "Here are the key parts of the PM\u2019s statement to the House of Commons about the EU council meeting. We\u2019re going to be closing this blog shortly and covering Amber Rudd\u2019s statement on the closure of the Calais \u201cjungle\u201d camp over on our Calais live blog. May said the UK would advocate for a free trade deal. I am determined that as we leave the EU, Britain will be the most passionate, the most consistent and the most convincing advocate of free trade anywhere in the world. I have been clear that the UK is already discussing our future trading relationships with third countries. As I made clear to the other Member States last week, this will not undermine the EU\u2019s trade agenda. She denied that the failure of the EU to agree a free trade deal with Canada was a setback for the UK. To those who suggest that these difficulties have a bearing on our own future negotiations, I would remind them that we are not seeking to replicate any existing model that any other country has in relation to its trade with the European Union. We will be developing our own British model \u2013 a new relationship for the UK with the EU \u2013 to be there for when we\u2019re outside the EU. She said she had told the EU that Britain wanted a \u201cmature, co-operative relationship that close friends and allies enjoy.\u201d A deal that will give British companies the maximum freedom to trade with and operate in the European market \u2013 and allow European businesses to do the same here. A deal that will deliver the deepest possible co-operation to ensure our national security and the security of our allies. A deal that is in Britain\u2019s interests \u2013 and the interests of all our European partners.But it will also be a deal that means we are a fully independent, sovereign nation \u2013 able to do what sovereign nations do, which means we will, for example, be free to decide for ourselves how we control immigration. That\u2019s it for now, join us over on the Calais live blog where we\u2019ll be covering the home secretary\u2019s statement. Here\u2019s Burnham\u2019s tweet after his question, suggesting the PM is backtracking. Lots of Labour big hitters speaking from the backbenchers today. Next up is Andy Burnham, the former shadow home secretary who is campaigning to be mayor of Greater Manchester. He asks about research carried out to assess the impact of \u201cthe harder form of Brexit that she seeks\u201d will have on the regions. May says that is a false premise. He talks of a hard Brexit this government is going to take the country into. There is no suggestion of that whatsoever. The gentleman seems to think all of these decisions are binary, whether you can control immigration or you can get a free trade deal. That is not the case. We are going to be ambitious in what we hope to get for the UK, a good trade deal as well as control on immigration. The DUP\u2019s Sir Jeffrey Donaldson asks if the UK is considering further cuts to corporation tax, rumoured to be slashed to 10%. The honourable gentleman \u201cshould not believe everything he reads in the newspapers\u201d, May says. Andrew Tyrie, the chair of the Treasury select committee, says the government\u2019s policy of saying as little as possible will be unsustainable. The vacuum is already being filled by leaks not from the commission but from her own Brexit colleagues. Does the PM accept that without some clarity soon, financial services will respond and plan for the worst, at considerable cost to the UK, he asks. May says she is well aware that business needs certainty - that was the reason behind the timetable for invoking Article 50, and the Great Repeal Bill which will transpose EU law into UK law. He knows full well that if this government would set out every jot and tittle, that would be the best way to get the worst deal for the UK. Hilary Benn, the new chair of the Brexit select committee, is up next. He says not revealing her negotiating hand is \u201cvery different from setting out her objectives\u201d. He says he wants an undertaking that the PM will \u201cpublish her objectives in time for the House and the new select committee to consider them, before she presents them to the other member states\u201d. May says she has set out those objectives already. There are already over 30 different reviews taking place in parliament, she says, giving ample opportunity for scrutiny. Edward Leigh, the Conservative MP, says Benn may have a point. Should we not make it clear that we are seeking a free trade agreement? \u201cI agree,\u201d says May. Tim Farron, the Lib Dem leader, said it is a \u201csad day\u201d that security was being compromised to appease irrational fears. \u201cWill she confirm now that we will remain an active member of Europol?\u201d he asks. The honourable gentlemen does not need to tell me about that, May says. \u201cAfter we leave we will be a confident and outward-looking nation, co-operating on our shared security.\u201d Farron throws up his hands in response. Dame Rosie Winterton, the former Labour chief whip, rises to huge cheers in the House, asking about estimates of regional impact of Brexit. May says this is an important point. While people often talk about the impact on Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland, there will be an impact on different parts of the UK. She said government departments are talking to administrations across the UK to make sure the negotiations are informed by every region. May is now taking questions from the SNP\u2019s Angus Robertson, after that tense meeting with Nicola Sturgeon and other devolved government leaders. He asked which of the specific issues raised by Scotland were subsequently raised by May at the EU summit. She cannot pretend to take the interests and concerns of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland seriously. Either she will, or she won\u2019t. If she won\u2019t, Scotland is right to hold another independence referendum. May said she is taking it seriously, which was what the joint ministerial meeting was about this morning. \u201cThat is precisely what we discussed today.\u201d May is responding to Corbyn\u2019s statement, saying that she was commended by EU leaders for her speech at the Conservative party conference, rather than condemned. One or two of the socialist leaders too, she adds. We have a plan, she says, which not to set out the details step-by-step, because that is a way not to get what we want. He couldn\u2019t decide whether we should be in or out. He couldn\u2019t decide when we should invoke article 50. The only certainty is that he would have unfettered immigration into this country. Unlike him, the Conservatives are listening to the British people. Corbyn is asking about Grant Shapps\u2019 proposal for a \u201csunset clause\u201d for the great repeal bill, which would potentially mean workers\u2019 rights derived from the EU would expire after a certain period. He says the lack of clarity on single market access, freedom of movement and other matters have meant that world leaders have concluded \u201cBritain hasn\u2019t got a clue\u201d. Day by day, confidence in this economy falls, and the British people become more worried about their future. Jeremy Corbyn is speaking now. He says he was in Brussels last Thursday and was given \u201crather longer\u201d than the PM had at the dinner with EU leaders, reported to have been just a short speech after midnight. Corbyn said EU leaders had sent a clear message that the tone of debate had damaged Britain\u2019s reputation \u201cnot just in Europe but around the world.\u201d He says anger and resentment has spread across Europe. \u201cThreats, hectoring or lecturing\u201d will not succeed in getting the UK a good deal, he says. May says the government \u201cwill make time available for general debates\u201d in parliament. These will take place before and after the Christmas recess. Members on all sides will understand the UK must not show its hand in detail in these negotiations, she said. There is huge noise in response in the chamber, both supportive and scornful. It is important that members have these opportunities to speak on behalf of their constituencies, May continues. May says negotiations will take time. \u201cIt will require patience and some give and take. But if we approach this in a constructive spirit, we can secure a smooth departure.\u201d May is now talking about trade post-Brexit. She said she had made clear to other EU countries that the UK is already starting preparatory trade talks with countries outside the EU. This will not undermine the EU\u2019s trade agenda, May said. As long as we remain a member of the EU, we will continue to back the EU\u2019s free trade negotiations. I share everyone\u2019s disappointment in the stalled talks between the EU and Canada, she said. But she said the difficulties would not have a bearing on the UK\u2019s own negotiations. We are not seeking to replicate any existing model, but our own model, she said. May is speaking now about the migration crisis, and said the UK would continue its assistance in the Aegean and Mediterranean. The PM said she had reiterated the case she made at the UN, helping refugees claim asylum in the first safe country they reach and making better distinctions between refugees and economic migrants. May is speaking in the House of Commons now about the European council summit last week. She says it was agreed that the EU keep up the pressure on Russia over the indiscriminate bombing of Aleppo. May said she spoke personally to German chancellor Angela Merkel and EU council president Donald Tusk about Russia, and it was agreed that nothing should be ruled out in response. There are millions of innocent civilians trapped \u2026 in desperate need of food, shelter and healthcare. We stand ready to accelerate over \u00a323m of aid for the EU to distribute on the ground. Tracy Brabin, the new MP for Batley and Spen, has just been sworn in, accompanied by fellow Labour MPs Luciana Berger and Holly Lynch. She\u2019s followed by Robert Courts, the new Conservative MP for Witney. An MP shouts \u201chope he\u2019s better than the last one\u201d. Perhaps inevitably, the responses from Scottish parties to the outcome of the JMC focus on how Brexit will impact on the constitutional question. Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale said the reports of little progress being made would be met \u201cwith real frustration across Scotland\u201d. She continued: \u201cInstead of advocating their own form of separatism with a hard brexit or independence, both governments need to focus on getting the best deal for Scotland.\u201d Meanwhile, Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson insisted that Scotland\u2019s best interests would be served \u201cby cooperation not confrontation between our two governments\u201d. Welcoming May\u2019s announcement of a new Brexit forum, Davidson added: \u201cNicola Sturgeon now needs to engage in a constructive fashion. The SNP isn\u2019t going to answer any of the issues thrown up by Brexit by dividing the United Kingdom. \u201cUsing Brexit to crank up support for separation is the wrong way to go. If the first minister truly wants to act in the best interests of all of Scotland, she should take her plans for an unwanted independence referendum off the table.\u201d Downing Street has released a statement on the joint ministerial council this morning. May told the leaders of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland that the UK would strike a \u201cbespoke Brexit deal that works for the whole of the UK\u201d. But the detail did not satisfy the first ministers. Following the meeting, Theresa May said: Working together, the nations of the United Kingdom will make a success of leaving the European Union \u2013 and we will further strengthen our own unique and enduring union as we do so. The great union between us has been the cornerstone of our prosperity in the past and it is absolutely vital to our success in the future. The country is facing a negotiation of tremendous importance and it is imperative that the devolved administrations play their part in making it work. The PM told Nicola Sturgeon, Carwyn Jones, Arlene Foster and Martin McGuinness repeatedly that how the UK leaves the EU should not be seen as a series of binary choices and will instead amount to a bespoke agreement for the UK Business secretary Greg Clark also outlined the government\u2019s new industrial strategy and called upon the devolved administrations to play a part in helping to shape it, Downing Street said. Number 10 also said May wanted the JMC meetings to take place more regularly and would set up another session early next year. For some light relief mid-afternoon, Twitter has been enjoying the polished leadership campaign video for Ukip\u2019s Jonathan Rees-Evans, which involves a rather strenuous-looking hike, and a montage outside John Lewis. Here\u2019s some more detail on the homelessness legislation that Javid has just announced. The homelessness reduction bill requires local authorities to: provide new homelessness services to all those affected, not just those who are protected under existing legislation. places a duty on local authorities to help eligible people at risk of homelessness to secure accommodation, 56 days before they are threatened with homelessness to provide those who find themselves homeless with support for a further period of 56 days to help to secure accommodation. ensure that other local services refer those either homeless or at risk of being homeless to local authority housing teams. Blackman said he was delighted the bill would pass with government approval. Throughout my 24 years in local government prior to becoming an MP, I saw the devastation that can be caused by homelessness first hand, with too many people simply slipping through the net under the current arrangements. The bill was published last week, and will have its second reading in the House of Commons on Friday. Javid, the communities secretary, has announced that the government will back a private members\u2019 bill by Tory MP Bob Blackman intended to reduce homelessness in England. The homelessness reduction bill is drawn from recommendations by Crisis and Shelter and requires councils to help people deemed likely to become homeless within 56 days. Javid told the Commons that the government would back Blackman\u2019s bill. We will be supporting my honourable friend\u2019s bill \u2026 I\u2019d like to thank him for all the hard work he has done. The Labour MP Stephen Kinnock, a supporter of the Open Britain campaign, said he was concerned by the mood coming out of the JMC meeting at Downing Street. Kinnock, who has the Welsh seat of Aberavon, said it would be wrong for Wales and others to be \u201cdowngraded from the role of full participant to partial consultant\u201d in the Brexit talks. Labour\u2019s Conor McGinn, who is from Northern Ireland, said a \u201cmore transparent and consensual approach is required if we are to finish these negotiations with a deal that works for every part of the UK\u201d. Carwyn Jones has released this statement on Twitter, also expressing frustration with the lack of clarity from the UK government. Tracy Brabin, the new MP for Batley and Spen, has been welcomed by MPs and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to the House of Commons. She will be formally sworn in at 3.30pm, alongside the new Conservative MP for Witney, Robert Courts. Brabin, who won a byelection last Tuesday, is taking the seat of the late MP Jo Cox, who was killed in June as she walked to a constituency surgery. Courts took the seat of former prime minster David Cameron. Tory MP Harriett Baldwin also tweeted her welcome to Courts. My colleague Peter Walker has been speaking to Sturgeon with other reporters in Downing Street, where she has been emphasising her frustration with the lack of clear Brexit objectives. Sturgeon denied claims from No 10 that her proposals could undermine the negotiations. I\u2019m not seeking to undermine anyone, I don\u2019t know what the UK\u2019s negotiating position is, so there\u2019s nothing there that I can see to undermine. I\u2019m the first minister of Scotland; 62% voted to remain. I wouldn\u2019t be doing my job if I wasn\u2019t out there talking to people and doing my best to protect Scotland\u2019s interests. I can\u2019t undermine something that doesn\u2019t exist, and at the moment it doesn\u2019t seem to me like there is a UK negotiating strategy, which is one of the sources of great frustration. Sturgeon says the UK has no firm negotiating strategy for the EU exit. Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, is speaking to reporters outside Downing Street. While other leaders said some progress had been made, Sturgeon is far more frank. I don\u2019t mind admitting that parts of the meeting were deeply frustrating. I don\u2019t know anymore now about the UK government\u2019s approach to the EU negotiations than I did before I went in. Sturgeon said she was pleased at the establishment of the subcommittee on Brexit, which would see devolved administrations have regular meetings with David Davis, but said a work programme was needed if those meetings were going to meaningfully influence discussions. She said she was prepared to listen to options, and I have said we will bring forward specific proposals over the next few weeks which would keep Scotland in the single market even if the rest of the UK leaves. We are hearing the words that she will consider options but that is not being matched by substance or action. Sturgeon said that she understood Wales and England had voted to leave, but said she was looking to \u201csquare that circle\u201d with Scotland\u2019s remain vote. Here\u2019s the photo from the joint ministerial council meeting inside Downing Street today. Martin McGuinness, the deputy first minister of Northern Ireland, has been speaking to reporters outside Downing Street. He said people at the meeting were very keen to establish the objectives of the UK government in the Brexit negotiations. McGuinness said it would be a \u201cvery tough and challenging negotiation ahead\u201d and there was a joint responsibility to manage the situation now. First Minister Arlene Foster said negotiations about access to the single market where only in their infancy. What we need is a meaningful engagement... but the PM rightly said there were no binary issues. We\u2019re in a negotiation and we will be in a negotiation and it will be complex. And what\u2019s important is that we are in the heart of that process. Belgian prime minister Charles Michel has said Belgium cannot agree to sign an EU-Canada trade deal because he had failed to secure the agreement of regional authorities. The EU had given Belgium until today to overcome opposition to the CETA trade deal before it would probably have to cancel a Thursday summit with Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau to sign the pact. The southern region of Wallonia has refused to sign the deal, which many have seen as a a potential signal that the UK will also have trouble. Northern Ireland secretary James Brokenshire said the meeting had been very productive. He said the government understood there were particular areas of concern for Northern Ireland. He said he would be an advocate for Northern Ireland because of those difficult factors. \u201cWe are unified in our approach with the Irish government to make sure we don\u2019t see a return to the borders of the past.\u201d The first ministers of Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have now wrapped up their meeting in Downing Street, which lasted just over two hours. Carwyn Jones, the Welsh first minister, told Sky News as he left No 10 that he though different Brexit deals for different regions or nations in the UK would be \u201cdifficult, if I\u2019m honest\u201d. Jones said the scale of the challenge was gigantic and he still had no real idea about the general principles the government would have going into the negotiations. He denied the meeting was a talking shop, and said the negotiating starting point needed to have devolved administrations on side rather than being publicly critical. \u201cWales voted to leave, but Wales didn\u2019t vote to be done over,\u201d he said. He said access to the single market was more important than any other issue, but feared that might be possible. That\u2019s what they are talking about, being outside the customs\u2019 union, outside even other arrangements that exists. It\u2019s bad for Britain to make it more expensive to sell in one of the world\u2019s largest markets. Rees-Evans admitted on the BBC\u2019s Daily Politics that he was not a well-known figure and said he had only become a member of Ukip recently. He said the Vice News piece was embellished and said it was normal for him to have carried the handgun in Bulgaria. I was trained by the British Army to operate weapons and it\u2019s a waste of taxpayer money if I don\u2019t maintain those skills. I did [have the gun in the store] but that was because it wasn\u2019t safe to hand it over to the security. They said to me the reason they don\u2019t allow weapons [in IKEA] is in case of an attack, and I said \u2018surely you want law-abiding people to be armed if there is an attack?\u2019 Rees-Evans also said he believed other candidates were jostling to take the part down a path which he said would end up as a conventional political party. He said he was proposing to transfer power from the leadership to the party members, via a system of direct democracy. The leadership, he said, would not have any power without it first being approved by members. Rees-Evans got demonstrably annoyed when presenter Jo Coburn brought up the gay donkey story, accusing her of trivialising his leadership bid. \u201cThis was playful banter with a mischievous activist,\u201d he said. The Welsh Ukip activist John Rees-Evans has been speaking to the Daily Politics, and has announced he is standing for the leadership, joining Suzanne Evans, Paul Nuttall and Raheem Kassam. Rees-Evans does not have much of a public profile, but has come to fleeting prominence for two rather odd incidents, including one where he accused a \u201cgay donkey\u201d of raping his horse. Rees-Evans was standing for the seat of Cardiff South and Penarth, when he told protesters outside his office that he had once had to protect his horse from a donkey\u2019s advances. I\u2019ve got a horse and it was there in the field. And a donkey came up\u2026which was male, and I\u2019m afraid tried to rape my horse. Rees-Evans has a home in rural Bulgaria, described in a Vice News article as a fortified compound which has a shooting range where the former soldier practices shooting paper portraits of terrorists. The interview also contains this fascinating tidbit. When he last went to IKEA, Rees-Evans persuaded the sales assistant it would be safer to let him carry his handgun, in case terrorists laid siege to the building. The SNP MP Stephen Gethins is speaking to the BBC\u2019s Daily Politics about some of the demands from Nicola Sturgeon at the meeting today. He says the UK government is prepared to look at a special arrangement on free movement for the financial services sector, and asks why that could not be the case for Scotland and Northern Ireland. This is something that has been done elsewhere in the European Union. We\u2019re looking for a solution that protects Scottish jobs. He says the demands are reasonable, and that he hopes that a second referendum would not be necessary. If you get a deal that protects jobs, keeps membership of the single market, free movement then that is something we need to consider. Gethins said a similar proposal about regional quotas for immigration was made by Michael Gove during the leave campaign. Grant Shapps is under some pressure this morning over his Times article (see 10,03am) that suggested there should be an expiry date for the so-called great repeal bill so that workers\u2019 rights derived from the EU could potentially be unpicked. The actor Michael Sheen is among those calling for clarification from Shapps. My colleague Rowena Mason has been at the lobby briefing from the PM\u2019s spokeswoman. The decision on expansion at Heathrow or Gatwick will be taken by May and other senior ministers at the airport subcommittee before cabinet tomorrow morning, but there was no confirmation of the exact timing. No 10 did not rule out that it could be announced before the markets opened, because it is so financially sensitive. There will be a statement to the House of Commons at 12.30pm. No 10 ruled out different Brexit deals being pursued by Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, saying the PM wanted a unified approach but was willing to listen to different proposals. No 10 also issued a warning to the SNP, saying the government \u201cexpect representatives to... in no way undermine UK negotiating.\u201d Sturgeon has been meeting EU ministers since the referendum result gauging support for an independent Scottish membership of the EU, so far getting a lukewarm reception. Here\u2019s a bit more context to that Civitas report I mentioned earlier on the cost of tariffs to EU economies. UK exporters face EU tariffs of \u00a35.2bn, while the EU faces a combined tariff of \u00a312.9bn. That will hardly give much comfort to UK trade negotiators, given the cost to the UK is far more than any single country in the EU. Germany would face around \u00a33.3bn, France around \u00a31.3bn, Ireland \u00a31.3bn and the Netherlands \u00a31.5bn. More usefully though, the report points out that 22 out of the EU 27 have a trade deficit with the UK, though deficits vary considerably. Here\u2019s the full table of countries, and the full report is here. The Guardian\u2019s Scotland correspondent Libby Brooks reports on the mood from the Scottish Greens conference: While the rhetoric stiffened over the weekend between the SNP government in Holyrood and the Tories in Westminster, the Scottish Greens were holding their first party conference since they won 6 seats in the Scottish parliament last May. It\u2019s no great surprise that the pro-independence party backed a motion supporting ongoing campaigning work towards independence. But it\u2019s worth noting, given that it confirms that any bill from the minority SNP government proposing a second referendum would definitely have a majority in the Scottish parliament \u2013 assuming that all SNP members support it too. MSP Ross Greer, who moved the motion, said: \u201cIt\u2019s becoming clear that Scotland may have to choose between the Brexit disaster zone Westminster is preparing for us or the fairer, more progressive society we could build with independence. \u201cGreens played a leading role in the 2014 referendum and we will continue to build the case for independence as a means of achieving a more just Scotland. It must remain an option on the table as the prospect of a damaging hard Brexit, driven by a bigoted Tory agenda, grows ever stronger.\u201d Scotland\u2019s has arrived at Downing Street, where she\u2019ll be joined by the Welsh first minister Carwyn Jones, Northern Ireland\u2019s first minister Arlene Foster and her deputy, Martin McGuinness. Apart from a few waves on the way into Number 10, all the leaders so far have remained tight-lipped. Theresa May will give a statement to the Commons after the meeting, at 3.30pm, which we\u2019ll cover here. The Lib Dem leader, Tim Farron, is giving a speech tonight at the Runnymede Trust on the rise in hate crime since the Brexit vote. Farron will warn of a rising acceptance of xenophobia in political discourse, particularly from the Conservatives, linking it to Zac Goldsmith\u2019s mayoral campaign against Sadiq Khan and Amber Rudd\u2019s proposal for firms to list their numbers of foreign workers. Here\u2019s some extracts from his speech. 2016 has been a year that has seen the Conservative party\u2019s attempts to detoxify their party go up in flames. Spring saw the disgraceful, racist London mayoral campaign. The summer saw a European campaign based on fear and terror, pitching community against community. And this autumn has seen Theresa May propose moves that will make Britain a nastier, more divided and more resentful country, with attacks on foreign doctors and students as well as checks on taxi drivers. I dread to think what\u2019s in store this winter. These are the actions of a nasty party, willing to play on prejudice for their own short-term gain. Theresa May used to criticise the Tory party for this approach, now she is leading it. One to watch for Wednesday: the former foreign secretary Jack Straw is giving evidence to the Northern Ireland affairs committee. The committee is looking into the role of the UK government in seeking compensation for the victims of IRA attacks made possible by the provision of semtex and other weapons by the former Gaddafi regime. Theresa Villiers, the former Northern Ireland secretary, has been speaking to Sky News about the potential issues for the Irish border, and a possible independence push from parties there. Villiers, who voted for Brexit, said the government knew it had to \u201ctry and come up with a settlement with which the majority of both leave and remain voters can be comfortable\u201d. I think it is crucial we maintain a land border with Ireland which is as open and free-flowing as possible; the government is very clear that\u2019s a top priority for the negotiations. Trade unions have already picked up the threats implicit in Shapps\u2019 comments this morning. This from Antonia Bance, the TUC\u2019s head of campaigns. And from the Labour grouping of trade unions, Unions Together. May\u2019s great repeal bill is set to be fraught with difficulties, the Times reports today, based on a revealing comment piece from former Conservative party chairman Grant Shapps. The paper reports that Shapps is planning a \u201csunset clause\u201d (\u00a3) to force ministers to pick and choose which laws to keep and which to repeal within five years, after which the laws would cease to be in force. Shapps says that although he voted to remain he is \u201cmore than happy to support (hard) Brexit.\u201d He signals that rightwing Tories are prepared to revolt against May\u2019s pledge to protect workers\u2019 rights. From ideas about placing workers on corporate boards to suggestions that companies will be forced to list the proportion of foreign workers, it sounds like the kind of red tape we spent most of the last parliament trying to shred. That challenge helped to strip costs and overheads from business, yet whenever we hit EU legislation we had to retreat. Now there is a chance to fix this too. The bill, which transposes *every* aspect of EU law into UK law, provides MPs of every stripe with the opportunity to push their own particular amendment on any pet project. One MP told the Times the bill would be \u201ccompletely, totally and utterly\u201d hijacked. People will say things like, \u2018Hang on, we\u2019re signing up to the working time directive. Why on earth are we putting all this stuff into our laws when we don\u2019t have to?\u2019. You\u2019ll get other people who say, \u2018Hang on, I want more protections for bees\u2019. It is going to be an enormous cock-up. Scottish Brexit minister Michael Russell has been speaking to Radio 4\u2019s Today programme in the last hour, ahead of the Downing Street meeting today. He said it would be strange if Brexit negotiations delivered special arrangements for sectors such as banking, but not for the nations of the UK. We want to have a good, straightforward, honest and open conversation about what the options are, and that process needs to start now. But of course independence has to be an option; it would be ridiculous to say that it shouldn\u2019t be, because these are circumstances - and it\u2019s absolutely important to remember this - we didn\u2019t ask to be in. Two key reports on the impact of Brexit are published today that are worth looking at in detail: a Civitas report looking at the tariff bill for EU and British companies after a \u2018hard\u2019 Brexit; and an Institute of Government report on the effect of Brexit on the union. Companies in the European Union would face annual tariffs two-and-a-half times higher than British companies, equalling almost \u00a313bn, if Britain departs the bloc without a free trade deal, according to Civitas, a right-leaning thinktank. EU firms would have to pay \u00a312.9bn a year in tariffs to the UK if Britain turned to World Trade Organisation terms after it left the bloc. The most affected sector would be car manufacturers, who would pay a theoretical \u00a33.9bn. In return, British exporters to the EU would, under WTO terms, have to pay \u00a35.2bn a year in tariffs. The Eurosceptic thinktank\u2019s report has been widely interpreted as showing how EU firms are far more dependent on free trade with the UK than we are. However, that \u00a35.2bn is still far the highest bill for any single nation, so the balance is not as tipped as some headlines might have you believe. Here\u2019s my colleague Peter Walker on the study: A \u201cfull-blown constitutional crisis\u201d could erupt unless agreement on the terms of Brexit can be reached between the government and the UK\u2019s devolved administrations, the IoG has warned. Unless all four leaders agree on the \u201ccore planks\u201d of the UK\u2019s negotiating position before May triggers article 50, the result could be \u201ca serious breakdown in relations between the four governments and nations of the UK\u201d, the thinktank says. The summit today, and the promise of a \u201cdirect line\u201d to David Davis\u2019 department is plainly May\u2019s plan to avert this. Here\u2019s the full background from our Scotland correspondent Libby Brooks. Good morning, it\u2019s Jessica Elgot here as Andrew Sparrow is off for the week. The main story today is the leaders of the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish governments arriving at Downing Street for a Brexit summit this morning, the first meeting of the joint ministerial committee in two years. With Nicola Sturgeon determined to press ahead with a new Scottish referendum consultation and dire warnings from Northern Ireland over the security risks of a hard border with the Republic of Ireland, May will offer the leaders a new official forum, to be chaired by David Davis, to air Brexit grievances. If agreed, the ministers will have guaranteed meetings once a year, hosted on a revolving basis by the four governments. Sturgeon, Welsh first minister Carwyn Jones, Northern Irish first minister Arlene Foster and her deputy Martin McGuinness will be at the meeting, which starts at 11am. May said she wants today to be the start of \u201ca new grown-up relationship\u201d \u2013 and promised the government would listen to each of the devolved administrations. The country is facing a negotiation of tremendous importance and it is imperative that the devolved administrations play their part in making it work. The new forum I am offering will be the chance for them all to put forward their proposals on how to seize the opportunities presented by Brexit and deliver the democratic decision expressed by the people of the UK. After the meeting, the leaders are expected to nominate representatives to attend negotiations with Davis, with the first by the end of November and at least one other by Christmas. Number 10 says the PM is expected to tell the leaders that \u201cno final decisions have been taken and that how the UK leaves the EU will not boil down to a binary choice.\u201d Scottish secretary David Mundell, Welsh secretary Alun Cairns and Northern Irish secretary James Brokenshire are also attending. Here\u2019s what else is coming up today: 2.30pm Oral questions in the Lords, including Labour peer Alf Dubs on the rights of EU migrants and Sarah Ludford on the Calais camp clearance. 3pm Karen Bradley, culture secretary, appears before the culture, media and sport select committee. 6.30pm: Lib Dem leader Tim Farron will give a speech at the Runnymede Trust on post-Brexit racism, which we will preview here. As usual, there will also be breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web.

          "bodyText": "The European Union has given Belgium\u2019s federal government until late on Monday to secure backing for an EU-Canada trade deal from the region of Wallonia or a planned summit to sign the pact will be cancelled. European Council president Donald Tusk, who chairs the collective body of the EU\u2019s 28 national leaders, will speak to Belgian prime minister Charles Michel by late on Monday, an EU source told Reuters, so that Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau can decide whether to fly to Brussels for the signing on Thursday. If Michel cannot assure Tusk that Belgium will be able to let the EU sign the Ceta agreement, then Thursday\u2019s EU-Canada summit will be postponed. No new date will be set, although the source said neither the EU nor Canada was willing to give up on a free trade pact that has been years in the making. But Paul Magnette, the leader of the Wallonia region, told the Belga news agency on Sunday that the ultimatum from the EU \u201cis not compatible with the exercise of democratic rights\u201d. Belgium\u2019s federal government cannot agree to the deal without the consent of five regional authorities, including French-speaking Wallonia. Magnette, a Socialist, says the deal is bad for Europe\u2019s farmers and gives too much power to global corporate interests. Magnette hit out at the EU, despite efforts by the bloc to provide reassurances to his government over investment protection \u2013 one of the major sticking points in negotiations between Brussels and Wallonia. One European diplomat said that the reassurances \u201cresponded to all of Mr Magnette\u2019s concerns\u201d. Tusk was expected to call Michel on Monday, a source told Agence France-Presse, and ask \u201cone simple question: will Belgium be in a position to sign the agreement on Thursday, yes or no?\u201d. Tusk will also call European Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, \u201cto share an assessment of where we are,\u201d and also Trudeau. \u201cRegarding Thursday, if Belgium is not in a position to say that they guarantee they can sign, it\u2019s very clear for Tusk that it doesn\u2019t make sense to have a summit, and there will be no summit, and there will be no date set for a new summit,\u201d the source said. Any decision would be made jointly by Tusk and Trudeau. Chrystia Freeland, Canada\u2019s trade minister, flew home from Brussels on Saturday saying the ball was in the EU\u2019s court after talks on Friday failed to overcome the differences. The CETA \u2013 or comprehensive economic and trade agreement \u2013 would link the EU market of 500 million people with the world\u2019s tenth biggest economy. The deal is opposed by anti-globalisation groups who say it is a test model to push through an even more controversial EU-US trade agreement called TTIP, talks on which have also stalled. Sebastian Dullien, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, criticised the commission for its role in the failure of negotiators to secure an agreement on the deal. \u201cThe European Commission carries part of the blame because it didn\u2019t quickly seek a dialogue with doubters. And for this type of deal, you need a large consensus,\u201d he said. Wallonia has some support for its position elsewhere in Europe. On Saturday, 8,000 people including young people, farmers, union leaders and entrepreneurs joined a rally in Amsterdam in a show of solidarity, organisers said. They held banners saying \u201cOur world is not for sale\u201d and \u201cStop these bad trade treaties\u201d. Wallonia has also enjoyed support from activist groups like Greenpeace which charged that the deal risked satisfying \u201ccorporate greed\u201d and trampling on people\u2019s rights and health standards on both sides of the Atlantic. British prime minister Theresa May on Friday dismissed warnings that the EU-Canada deal raised serious questions about whether London could strike a similar agreement with the bloc after Brexit.

But a tiny yet determined minority of Canadians roundly reject the notion that Trump holds little appeal in Canada, and instead are actively rallying their compatriots to join them in backing the controversial candidate. \u201cI know what he says doesn\u2019t click with a lot of people.

The extra time will offer the government the opportunity to get it right, said Ralph Goodale, Canada\u2019s public safety minister, as he announced the consultation. \u201cA lot of people felt shut out, and we promised to give them the opportunity to be heard.\u201d </p> <p>On Tuesday, Snowden suggested what he described as the minimum changes needed to the law, such as the creation of a judicial body that would carry out a case-by-case review of every individual exercise of these powers. \u201cAnd this means those individuals working in those spy agencies know simply that as long as they follow the law, they\u2019ll be fine,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The law allows information on Canadians to be shared between more than a dozen federal institutions. \u201cAll the activities held in our private lives, our private records, are being used as a kind of currency to gain standing and status within this surveillance network,\u201d said Snowden. \u201cWe\u2019re being traded like baseball cards.\u201d </p> <p>Any sharing of information \u2013 by those within Canada and with foreign agencies \u2013 that doesn\u2019t result in a trial or charges should be disclosed to individuals once a particular time frame has lapsed, he said, allowing people to ensure their rights have not been violated in any way.</p> <p>Snowden also took aim at the law\u2019s vague and undefined language. \u201cA lot of what classifies as terrorism in the political context \u2013 individuals that the news calls terrorist \u2013 are really common criminals,\u201d said Snowden. \u201cBut they do not constitute the kind of super criminal threat that is represented by our terrorism legislation.\u201d</p> <p>He pointed to the obvious need for law enforcement to have the right tools to counter these threats. \u201cBut we do not want to sacrifice everything that makes our societies great,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do not want to reorder the boundaries of our rights for the convenience of law enforcement officials, if it\u2019s not truly necessary, if it means we lose everything that we\u2019re trying to defend.\u201d</p>",

Trudeau vowed to amend the \u201cproblematic elements\u201d of the law, rather than simply repeal the legislation, noted Snowden. \u201cBecause he\u2019s afraid of being politically attacked on the basis of being soft on terrorism, regardless of whether or not this law actually helps prevent any terrorist attacks,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is just the way the politics of fear work.\u201d Last month the Liberal government launched a wide-ranging consultation on national security, meaning any potential changes to the law will probably be delayed until next year. The extra time will offer the government the opportunity to get it right, said Ralph Goodale, Canada\u2019s public safety minister, as he announced the consultation. \u201cA lot of people felt shut out, and we promised to give them the opportunity to be heard.\u201d On Tuesday, Snowden suggested what he described as the minimum changes needed to the law, such as the creation of a judicial body that would carry out a case-by-case review of every individual exercise of these powers. \u201cAnd this means those individuals working in those spy agencies know simply that as long as they follow the law, they\u2019ll be fine,\u201d he said. The law allows information on Canadians to be shared between more than a dozen federal institutions. \u201cAll the activities held in our private lives, our private records, are being used as a kind of currency to gain standing and status within this surveillance network,\u201d said Snowden. \u201cWe\u2019re being traded like baseball cards.\u201d Any sharing of information \u2013 by those within Canada and with foreign agencies \u2013 that doesn\u2019t result in a trial or charges should be disclosed to individuals once a particular time frame has lapsed, he said, allowing people to ensure their rights have not been violated in any way. Snowden also took aim at the law\u2019s vague and undefined language. \u201cA lot of what classifies as terrorism in the political context \u2013 individuals that the news calls terrorist \u2013 are really common criminals,\u201d said Snowden. \u201cBut they do not constitute the kind of super criminal threat that is represented by our terrorism legislation.\u201d He pointed to the obvious need for law enforcement to have the right tools to counter these threats. \u201cBut we do not want to sacrifice everything that makes our societies great,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do not want to reorder the boundaries of our rights for the convenience of law enforcement officials, if it\u2019s not truly necessary, if it means we lose everything that we\u2019re trying to defend.\u201d",

All member countries including those who refused to acknowledge LGBTQ communities, have signed an agenda which says: \u201cWe share a vision of cities for all \u2026 without discrimination of any kind \u2026 We further commit to promote culture and respect for diversity, and equality as key elements in the humanisation of our cities.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no real call for inclusion without LGBTQ rights,\u201d says Javier Jileta, director of Scientika, a Mexico City-based organisation focused on policy design for governments, who is keen to stand up for gay rights at the conference. \u201cThe LGBTQ community is constantly marginalised and Habitat III is no exception. When our rights are not being taken into account this shows how much of the agenda is conservative.\u201d</p> <p>Castro, <a href=\"http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD\">HUD</a> secretary since 2014, has long been an advocate for LGBTQ rights. He continues the work of former HUD secretary Shaun Donovan, who in 2012 promulgated the Equal Access rule that has sought to ensure LGBTQ individuals would not face discrimination in public housing and Section 8 housing. </p> <p>\u201cPeople are still denied housing because of their sexual orientation to this day in the US and elsewhere,\u201d Castro explains at Habitat III in a rare room of quiet away from the crowds. \u201cLGBTQ individuals are often at the greatest risk of homelessness.\u201d</p> <p>In 2012, <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/study-40-percent-of-homeless-youth-are-lgbt-family-rejection-is-leading-cause-a2aaa72c414a#.noezlt1yf\">research showed</a> that 40% of homeless youth in the US were LGBTQ (even though LGBTQ youth only made up 7% of the population) mostly as a result of being evicted from family homes or escaping abuse.

The <a href=\"http://www.transequality.org/sites/default/files/docs/resources/NTDS_Report.pdf\">2011 National Transgender Discrimination Survey</a> showed that 29% of transgender people who sought emergency shelter were turned away.</p> <p>Speaking at the US and Canada-led event at Habitat III, Danilo Manzano, an activist from Quito who described the silence on LGBTQ rights in the New Urban Agenda as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/danomanzano/status/787358969836740609\">\u201coutrageous\u201d</a>, was emotional as he spoke of the challenges he faces as a gay Ecuadorian citizen. \u201cI\u2019m about to turn 30, and every single day I want to be a dad, but I can\u2019t. LGBT people can\u2019t have children in Ecuador. We struggle to secure housing because we can\u2019t get married.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cA few days ago I got asked why the LGBT community wants to be included in the New Urban Agenda,\u201d Manzano reflects with a dry laugh. \u201cThe thing you need to remember is: we are normal too.\u201d</p> <p>There are alliances of cities which are working hard towards inclusion. The international <a href=\"https://www.movisie.com/news/international-cities-form-rainbow-cities-network\">Rainbow Cities</a> network shares and promotes LGBTQ policies in cities around the world, believing that municipal and regional authorities have an important and specific task in combatting discrimination.</p> <p>One city trying to join the Rainbow network is S\u00e3o Paulo. Felipe de Paula, S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s secretary for human rights and citizenship, agrees the LGBTQ agenda is missing at Habitat III. \u201cLGBTQ rights are part of the human rights agenda,\u201d he says. </p> <p>S\u00e3o Paulo, which has a Right to the City Coordination embedded in local government, has publicly funded centres of LGBTQ citizenship across the city that offer legal, health, social and psychological support. There is also a specific city policy for transgender citizens, working to achieve better inclusivity in education and employment. De Paula insists this is the first policy of this kind in Latin America. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/oct/18/world-quito-ecuador-future-cities-local-voices-habitat-3\">The world is in Quito to discuss cities \u2013 but are local voices heard at Habitat III?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe right to the city for us means a city for everyone, including LGBTQ,\u201d he says. \u201cS\u00e3o Paulo is a city for people and for everyone.\u201d</p> <p>This week, the Human Rights Campaign <a href=\"http://www.hrc.org/blog/human-rights-campaign-releases-5th-annual-municipal-equality-index\">released its 2016 Municipal Equality Index</a>, scoring American cities on how inclusive their policies and practices are for LGBTQ people, and explained that the report shows that cities across the nation \u201care not waiting for their states to extend vital protections to the LGBTQ community, nor are they intimidated by some state elected officials threatening to deny cities the ability to extend fully-inclusive protections to their residents and workers.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCities are actually able to get stuff done,\u201d lead author Kate Oakley <a href=\"http://time.com/4531933/cities-most-lgbt-friendly-policies/\">told Time magazine</a>, \u201crather than getting bogged down in partisanship.\u201d<br></p> <p>It\u2019s clear that the pressure for better LGBTQ inclusion in cities is not just coming from activist groups, but from the government level too. If, as the Human Rights campaign suggests, it is a matter of cities v states in the march towards inclusivity, then an international policy recommendation document like the New Urban Agenda would be an unprecedentedly powerful call to LGBTQ inclusion around the world. </p> <p>\u201cIt is a matter of human rights,\u201d adds Colau, \u201cand a democratic urban agenda can\u2019t exist without LGBTQ groups.\u201d</p> <p><em>Follow Guardian Cities on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardiancities\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardiancities\">Facebook</a> and join the discussion</em></p>",

Her statement is in response to the fact that the United Nation\u2019s New Urban Agenda, a manifesto for better cities meant to influence global urban policy, and which is being agreed at the Habitat III conference in Quito this week, has not acknowledged LGBTQ rights. This is not an omission that has gone unnoticed. Canada, backed by the European Union, the United States and Mexico, as well as Argentina and Colombia, has for months pushed for including the recognition of LGBTQ people in a list of \u201cvulnerable groups\u201d in the New Urban Agenda who should not be discriminated against. But during the negotiations over the agenda, a group of up to 17 countries led by Belarus \u2013 and including Russia, Egypt, Qatar, Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Somalia and Iran \u2013 blocked the inclusion of LGBTQ rights in the agenda, requesting their removal from a list of groups the document condemns violence against. In a world where same sex relationships are illegal in 76 countries around the world and punishable by death in seven, recognition of LGBTQ rights in such a central UN document would be a powerful move. In a packed room at Habitat III, the United States secretary of housing and urban development (HUD), Julian Castro, explains that the US, along with other countries, \u201chave fought hard to get an outright protection of LGBTQ rights in the New Urban agenda \u2013 and we\u2019re going to keep pushing. The 21st century will belong to those nations which embrace freedom and equality for everyone.\u201d Co-organised by Canada and the US, the panel event called on fellow UN member states to include LGBTQ rights in the implementation of the New Urban Agenda. In attendance is Ellen Woodsworth, chairperson of Women Transforming Cities International and former Vancouver city councillor, who feels strongly about the omission of LGBTQ individuals from the New Urban Agenda. Along with a group based in Vancouver, she has published the Queer Declaration calling for inclusion in the implementation of New Urban Agenda. \u201cWe decided to draw up a Queer Declaration to express the serious situation of LGBTQ people all over the world who face death, imprisonment, lack of housing, jobs and basic human rights as reasons why we should be explicitly included in the text,\u201d she explains. The declaration calls on the New Urban Agenda to \u201crecognise the unique vulnerabilities\u201d of LGBTQ people and \u201cempower LGBTQ people to participate at all levels of governance to create equitable, safe, socially inclusive and sustainable cities.\u201d The declaration has been endorsed by a number of Canadian politicians as well as social organisations. The New Urban Agenda uses the word \u201cinclusive\u201d 36 times to describe the kind of city it promotes, and yet LGBTQ rights do not appear as part of this. All member countries including those who refused to acknowledge LGBTQ communities, have signed an agenda which says: \u201cWe share a vision of cities for all \u2026 without discrimination of any kind \u2026 We further commit to promote culture and respect for diversity, and equality as key elements in the humanisation of our cities.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no real call for inclusion without LGBTQ rights,\u201d says Javier Jileta, director of Scientika, a Mexico City-based organisation focused on policy design for governments, who is keen to stand up for gay rights at the conference. \u201cThe LGBTQ community is constantly marginalised and Habitat III is no exception. When our rights are not being taken into account this shows how much of the agenda is conservative.\u201d Castro, HUD secretary since 2014, has long been an advocate for LGBTQ rights. He continues the work of former HUD secretary Shaun Donovan, who in 2012 promulgated the Equal Access rule that has sought to ensure LGBTQ individuals would not face discrimination in public housing and Section 8 housing. \u201cPeople are still denied housing because of their sexual orientation to this day in the US and elsewhere,\u201d Castro explains at Habitat III in a rare room of quiet away from the crowds. \u201cLGBTQ individuals are often at the greatest risk of homelessness.\u201d In 2012, research showed that 40% of homeless youth in the US were LGBTQ (even though LGBTQ youth only made up 7% of the population) mostly as a result of being evicted from family homes or escaping abuse. Last year, Castro\u2019s department launched the LGBTQ Youth Homelessness Prevention Initiative with the True Colors Fund, an organisation founded by singer Cyndi Lauper that provides safe spaces and housing solutions for LGBTQ homeless youth. Last month, a new regulation released by HUD aimed to prevent further discrimination by requiring that homeless shelters must respect the gender identity of transgender and gender non-conforming people. The 2011 National Transgender Discrimination Survey showed that 29% of transgender people who sought emergency shelter were turned away. Speaking at the US and Canada-led event at Habitat III, Danilo Manzano, an activist from Quito who described the silence on LGBTQ rights in the New Urban Agenda as \u201coutrageous\u201d, was emotional as he spoke of the challenges he faces as a gay Ecuadorian citizen. \u201cI\u2019m about to turn 30, and every single day I want to be a dad, but I can\u2019t. LGBT people can\u2019t have children in Ecuador. We struggle to secure housing because we can\u2019t get married.\u201d \u201cA few days ago I got asked why the LGBT community wants to be included in the New Urban Agenda,\u201d Manzano reflects with a dry laugh. \u201cThe thing you need to remember is: we are normal too.\u201d There are alliances of cities which are working hard towards inclusion. The international Rainbow Cities network shares and promotes LGBTQ policies in cities around the world, believing that municipal and regional authorities have an important and specific task in combatting discrimination. One city trying to join the Rainbow network is S\u00e3o Paulo. Felipe de Paula, S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s secretary for human rights and citizenship, agrees the LGBTQ agenda is missing at Habitat III. \u201cLGBTQ rights are part of the human rights agenda,\u201d he says. S\u00e3o Paulo, which has a Right to the City Coordination embedded in local government, has publicly funded centres of LGBTQ citizenship across the city that offer legal, health, social and psychological support. There is also a specific city policy for transgender citizens, working to achieve better inclusivity in education and employment. De Paula insists this is the first policy of this kind in Latin America. \u201cThe right to the city for us means a city for everyone, including LGBTQ,\u201d he says. \u201cS\u00e3o Paulo is a city for people and for everyone.\u201d This week, the Human Rights Campaign released its 2016 Municipal Equality Index, scoring American cities on how inclusive their policies and practices are for LGBTQ people, and explained that the report shows that cities across the nation \u201care not waiting for their states to extend vital protections to the LGBTQ community, nor are they intimidated by some state elected officials threatening to deny cities the ability to extend fully-inclusive protections to their residents and workers.\u201d \u201cCities are actually able to get stuff done,\u201d lead author Kate Oakley told Time magazine, \u201crather than getting bogged down in partisanship.\u201d It\u2019s clear that the pressure for better LGBTQ inclusion in cities is not just coming from activist groups, but from the government level too. If, as the Human Rights campaign suggests, it is a matter of cities v states in the march towards inclusivity, then an international policy recommendation document like the New Urban Agenda would be an unprecedentedly powerful call to LGBTQ inclusion around the world. \u201cIt is a matter of human rights,\u201d adds Colau, \u201cand a democratic urban agenda can\u2019t exist without LGBTQ groups.\u201d Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter and Facebook and join the discussion",

          "body": "<p>I didn\u2019t give much thought to Canada for the first 18 years of my life. Many Americans would not see this as a problem \u2013 Americans who think of Canada as \u2018America\u2019s hat\u2019. But when I found myself in a bar with hundreds of Canadian strangers on my first night at university in Montreal (a city where I could legally go to a bar at 18), I realized that this had been a tremendous oversight. </p> <p>\u201cWho\u2019s the prime minister of Canada?\u201d someone asked me, when I confessed my American-ness. I had no idea, and it hit me like a hockey puck smashed into an unguarded net: my ignorance of Canada was an awful oversight. For my whole life all of these Canadians had been living in Canada, not wanting to be American, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://mentalfloss.com/article/81468/why-do-canadians-drink-milk-bags\">drinking milk from bags.</a> </p> <p>Perhaps that\u2019s why I was particularly moved by <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/18/world/americas/sympathetic-canadians-have-a-message-for-americans-you-guys-are-great.html?module=WatchingPortal&amp;region=c-column-middle-span-region&amp;pgType=Homepage&amp;action=click&amp;mediaId=thumb_square&amp;state=standard&amp;contentPlacement=3&amp;version=internal&amp;contentCollection=www.nytimes.com&amp;contentId=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2016%2F10%2F18%2Fworld%2Famericas%2Fsympathetic-canadians-have-a-message-for-americans-you-guys-are-great.html&amp;eventName=Watching-article-click\">the sympathetic message sent south this week</a> by some lovely northern neighbors: <em>America</em>, they say, <em>you guys are already great</em>. Designed by a Toronto-based creative agency, the video and accompanying social media campaign aims to help Canadians to \u201cmake a positive contribution to an election season that has been downright depressing\u201d.</p> <p>Like an ignored younger sibling reaching out to give a gentle squeeze of the hand to a pompous, bullying older one in a time of sudden vulnerability, it\u2019s a most Canadian acknowledgment of our current predicament. Polite. Sensitive. Cheerful. Gently overlooking the fact that Canada rarely crosses the mind of many Americans unless they\u2019re looking for a way to easily emigrate if national leadership is passed into the hands of a despotic, racist egomaniac by a bonkers electorate.</p> <p>Americans often speak as if \u201cmoving to Canada\u201d to escape the worst of the United States is a decision that can be made casually. We discuss the idea as though we believe that Canada is but a giant, pleasant, snowy backyard that we can wander into when we feel like it. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/us-money-blog/2016/may/12/donald-trump-president-move-to-canada\">That\u2019s far from the case</a>, and not just because you do have to complete a rigorous visa application process. As I learned that night so many years ago, many Canadians do live up to their national stereotypes of being <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/humor/borowitz-report/canada-fears-photo-of-prime-minister-with-pandas-could-worsen-american-refugee-crisis\">friendly cuddlers of panda bears</a>, and people who will apologize with genuine feeling if you step on their foot. But despite 75% of Canadians living 100 miles (or fewer) from our northern border, they\u2019re proud of their distinctly non-American national identity and don\u2019t regard us with particular envy \u2013 ever, not only when we\u2019re in dire circumstances.</p> <p>Is there a note of smugness to the #tellamericaitsgreat campaign? Perhaps just a touch. But I learned from my years in Canada not to hold a grudge.

          "bodyText": "I didn\u2019t give much thought to Canada for the first 18 years of my life. Many Americans would not see this as a problem \u2013 Americans who think of Canada as \u2018America\u2019s hat\u2019. But when I found myself in a bar with hundreds of Canadian strangers on my first night at university in Montreal (a city where I could legally go to a bar at 18), I realized that this had been a tremendous oversight. \u201cWho\u2019s the prime minister of Canada?\u201d someone asked me, when I confessed my American-ness. I had no idea, and it hit me like a hockey puck smashed into an unguarded net: my ignorance of Canada was an awful oversight. For my whole life all of these Canadians had been living in Canada, not wanting to be American, drinking milk from bags. Perhaps that\u2019s why I was particularly moved by the sympathetic message sent south this week by some lovely northern neighbors: America, they say, you guys are already great. Designed by a Toronto-based creative agency, the video and accompanying social media campaign aims to help Canadians to \u201cmake a positive contribution to an election season that has been downright depressing\u201d. Like an ignored younger sibling reaching out to give a gentle squeeze of the hand to a pompous, bullying older one in a time of sudden vulnerability, it\u2019s a most Canadian acknowledgment of our current predicament. Polite. Sensitive. Cheerful. Gently overlooking the fact that Canada rarely crosses the mind of many Americans unless they\u2019re looking for a way to easily emigrate if national leadership is passed into the hands of a despotic, racist egomaniac by a bonkers electorate. Americans often speak as if \u201cmoving to Canada\u201d to escape the worst of the United States is a decision that can be made casually. We discuss the idea as though we believe that Canada is but a giant, pleasant, snowy backyard that we can wander into when we feel like it. That\u2019s far from the case, and not just because you do have to complete a rigorous visa application process. As I learned that night so many years ago, many Canadians do live up to their national stereotypes of being friendly cuddlers of panda bears, and people who will apologize with genuine feeling if you step on their foot. But despite 75% of Canadians living 100 miles (or fewer) from our northern border, they\u2019re proud of their distinctly non-American national identity and don\u2019t regard us with particular envy \u2013 ever, not only when we\u2019re in dire circumstances. Is there a note of smugness to the #tellamericaitsgreat campaign? Perhaps just a touch. But I learned from my years in Canada not to hold a grudge. After all, that country, too, is far from perfect \u2013 from Vancouver to St John\u2019s, there\u2019s plenty of tussling between right and left over the same issues that cripple our government, from crime to climate change to healthcare. But the debate is undergirded by a level of stability most Americans can only dream about. There\u2019s a public healthcare system in place. There\u2019s a federal government commitment to work on climate change. And contrary to rumor, Canada has far fewer guns per capita than the US, and far fewer gun-related deaths (one study found that \u2018you\u2019re more likely to be shot to death in the US than to die in a car accident in Canada\u2019). In 2009, the inauguration of President Obama made some people speculate that Canadians would no longer be able to look down on their southern neighbors the way they once did. They shouldn\u2019t have worried. If, indeed, not being American is a defining part of Canadian identity, is there any better time to be Canadian than the autumn of 2016?",

In Ottawa last week, Canadian prime minister <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/eu-rejection-canada-trade-pact-send-wrong-message-150527090.html\">Justin Trudeau</a> surveyed the hundreds of thousands of Europeans demonstrating against the continent\u2019s treaty with his country and said: \u201cIf \u2026 Europe is unable to sign a progressive trade agreement with a country like Canada, well, then with whom will Europe think that it can do business in the years to come?\u201d</p> <p>Their outriders in the press have dropped the pretence of liberal politesse for red-cheeked self-righteousness. The hairy-palmed hordes are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/13/liberal-internationalists-populists-globalisation\">coming for our internationalism</a>! As if internationalism were little more than business-class flights and the freedom to structure derivatives across several time zones. The Economist slaps an image of anti-globalisation demonstrators on its cover with the headline: \u201c<a href=\"https://image.issuu.com/161002070406-64bef4336bdc2cc1ad4576efec597e0b/jpg/page_1.jpg\">Why they\u2019re wrong</a>\u201d. Note that use of \u201cthey\u201d, with its shadow of the drawbridge being hastily pulled up. Coming soon, perhaps: \u201cWhy can\u2019t we get the 99% we deserve?\u201d</p> <p>I heartily agree that Nigel Farage and Trump are grotesques. But the free-traders peddle their own untruths. They have insisted that black is white, even as the voters beg to differ. In their seminar rooms, their TV studios and their Geneva offices, they have perpetrated the ideological sleight of hand that equates internationalism with free trade, and globalisation with untrammelled corporate power. The result has been misery for workers from Bolton to Baltimore to Bangladesh. But it has also left the six-figure technocrats who supervise our economic system pushing a zombie idea. Because that is what free trade has become: an idea leached of life and meaning but stumbling on for want of any replacement. We have a globalisation for bankers, but not for children fleeing the bombs of Syria. Security for investors but not for workers.</p> <p>To see how debased the notion of free trade has become, look at the deal between Canada and the EU that is currently being voted through Europe\u2019s parliaments. It\u2019s called the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/06/transatlantic-trade-partnership-ttip-canada-eu\">Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement</a> (Ceta), and the fact that you can see it at all is largely down to leaks of the documents, which forced the European commission to publish,. That is after the negotiations were conducted for five years in secret, with even the <a href=\"http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2015/12/15-eu-canada-trade-negotiating-mandate-made-public/\">directives kept hidden</a> from the hundreds of millions of citizens affected.</p> <p>This is no minor technical work. Provided it is passed in time, Ceta will apply to Britain too \u2013 and parts of it will affect Britons\u2019 lives even after we\u2019ve \u201ctaken back control\u201d. It has been billed as \u201ca backdoor for TTIP\u201d, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, which <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/08/28/eus-ttip-trade-deal-with-the-us-has-collapsed-says-germany/\">collapsed this summer</a> amid public opposition both in Europe and the US. Like TTIP, Ceta includes the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/10/obscure-legal-system-lets-corportations-sue-states-ttip-icsid\">investor-state dispute settlement system</a> \u2013 which hands big business the power to sue governments, including for profits they haven\u2019t made yet. A US multinational with an office in Canada (nearly all of them) will be able to sue Britons for bringing in laws that lose them money. This was the mechanism tobacco giant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/dec/18/australia-wins-international-legal-battle-with-philip-morris-over-plain-packaging\">Philip Morris used to sue Australia\u2019s government</a> for bringing in plain packaging. On that occasion, Big Tobacco was unsuccessful \u2013 but it took four years of expensive legal battle.</p> <p>Free trade used to be about tackling protectionism; now it\u2019s about protecting big business \u2013 against the public. If populists take a complex situation, offer a simple answer and warn any dissenters of gruesome consequences, then the free-traders are guilty of populism too. With Ceta or TTIP, it goes like this: if this deal goes through, then economies will grow, jobs will appear, and a rising tide will lift all boats, from super-yacht to rubber dinghy. That is pretty much what mainstream politicians of Europe \u2013 both left and right \u2013 and their officials are saying about the deal with Canada.</p> <p>In economic history, never mind that the biggest winners \u2013 whether the US in the early 1900s or China now \u2013 are those who break the free trade rules. Never mind that the actual forecasts for Ceta show the gains will be relatively meagre. Never mind that the studies cited don\u2019t bother to look at who wins and loses, and by how much.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>An auto engineer can up sticks and turn into a software engineer. If there aren\u2019t any jobs, they can work for Deliveroo</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Most of all, ignore their shared assumption that after any deal the affected economies undergo a short, sharp shock before bouncing back. Anyone who has lived through the past eight years has heard that one before. After the financial crisis, the Bank of England and Treasury both kept forecasting a return to normal \u2013 and they kept getting it wrong. Eight years on, that bounceback hasn\u2019t materialised. <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/datasets/averageweeklyearningsearn01\">British workers are still not paid as much</a> after inflation as they were when Lehman Brothers collapsed.</p> <p>That assumption\u2019s lack of substance is called a \u201cdirty little secret\u201d by two independent economists, Pierre Kohler and Servaas Storm, in a <a href=\"http://www.ase.tufts.edu/gdae/Pubs/wp/16-03CETA.pdf\">recent paper</a> scrutinising the likely effects of Ceta. As they say, it presumes that laid-off workers \u201cwill rapidly find new jobs\u201d \u2013 whatever the industry, however far away the employer. A car engineer can up sticks and turn into a software engineer. And if there aren\u2019t any actual jobs, they can deliver takeaways for Deliveroo.</p> <p>The assumptions are both laughably far-fetched and, in the cost citizens are expected to bear, disgusting. No wonder the EU would rather there was as little public discussion as possible.</p> <p>Using a model employed by the UN, Kohler and Storm found that the benefits of Ceta become microscopic next to the costs. For at least the first seven years after the agreement is brought in, unemployment will rise, wages will fall and economies will see their growth rates decline. Governments will lose revenue, and so increase austerity.</p> <p>The burden will fall hardest on the poorest, the lowest-skilled, older people and those with disabilities. A senior lecturer at Delft University of Technology, Storm summed up for me the consequences: \u201cThe weaker your position in an economy, the more strongly you\u2019ll feel the fall-out.\u201d These aren\u2019t people and regions who are left behind: they\u2019ve been chucked off the train by their own governments. This is the settlement free-traders, left and right, are fighting to impose on voters. Is it any wonder the voters keep plumping for alternatives \u2013 no matter how reprehensible, how ruinous?</p> <p>\u2022 You can catch up on the discussion we had on this article and others on our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/19/your-opinions-the-perils-of-globalisation-and-the-future-of-the-tory-left\">Your Opinions thread, which </a>is now closed.</p>",

          "bodyText": "How they frown. How they fulminate. How they threaten. For decades, presidents and prime ministers, policymakers and pundits have told voters there is only one direction of travel: free trade. Now comes Brexit and Donald Trump \u2013 and the horrible suspicion that the public won\u2019t buy it any more. This is how an elite project falls apart. And the elites don\u2019t know what to do, apart from keep insisting the public listen. In Washington last month, you could barely move for wagging fingers as the heads of the IMF, the World Bank and the World Trade Organisation warned that free trade was in mortal danger. In Ottawa last week, Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau surveyed the hundreds of thousands of Europeans demonstrating against the continent\u2019s treaty with his country and said: \u201cIf \u2026 Europe is unable to sign a progressive trade agreement with a country like Canada, well, then with whom will Europe think that it can do business in the years to come?\u201d Their outriders in the press have dropped the pretence of liberal politesse for red-cheeked self-righteousness. The hairy-palmed hordes are coming for our internationalism! As if internationalism were little more than business-class flights and the freedom to structure derivatives across several time zones. The Economist slaps an image of anti-globalisation demonstrators on its cover with the headline: \u201cWhy they\u2019re wrong\u201d. Note that use of \u201cthey\u201d, with its shadow of the drawbridge being hastily pulled up. Coming soon, perhaps: \u201cWhy can\u2019t we get the 99% we deserve?\u201d I heartily agree that Nigel Farage and Trump are grotesques. But the free-traders peddle their own untruths. They have insisted that black is white, even as the voters beg to differ. In their seminar rooms, their TV studios and their Geneva offices, they have perpetrated the ideological sleight of hand that equates internationalism with free trade, and globalisation with untrammelled corporate power. The result has been misery for workers from Bolton to Baltimore to Bangladesh. But it has also left the six-figure technocrats who supervise our economic system pushing a zombie idea. Because that is what free trade has become: an idea leached of life and meaning but stumbling on for want of any replacement. We have a globalisation for bankers, but not for children fleeing the bombs of Syria. Security for investors but not for workers. To see how debased the notion of free trade has become, look at the deal between Canada and the EU that is currently being voted through Europe\u2019s parliaments. It\u2019s called the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (Ceta), and the fact that you can see it at all is largely down to leaks of the documents, which forced the European commission to publish,. That is after the negotiations were conducted for five years in secret, with even the directives kept hidden from the hundreds of millions of citizens affected. This is no minor technical work. Provided it is passed in time, Ceta will apply to Britain too \u2013 and parts of it will affect Britons\u2019 lives even after we\u2019ve \u201ctaken back control\u201d. It has been billed as \u201ca backdoor for TTIP\u201d, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, which collapsed this summer amid public opposition both in Europe and the US. Like TTIP, Ceta includes the investor-state dispute settlement system \u2013 which hands big business the power to sue governments, including for profits they haven\u2019t made yet. A US multinational with an office in Canada (nearly all of them) will be able to sue Britons for bringing in laws that lose them money. This was the mechanism tobacco giant Philip Morris used to sue Australia\u2019s government for bringing in plain packaging. On that occasion, Big Tobacco was unsuccessful \u2013 but it took four years of expensive legal battle. Free trade used to be about tackling protectionism; now it\u2019s about protecting big business \u2013 against the public. If populists take a complex situation, offer a simple answer and warn any dissenters of gruesome consequences, then the free-traders are guilty of populism too. With Ceta or TTIP, it goes like this: if this deal goes through, then economies will grow, jobs will appear, and a rising tide will lift all boats, from super-yacht to rubber dinghy. That is pretty much what mainstream politicians of Europe \u2013 both left and right \u2013 and their officials are saying about the deal with Canada. In economic history, never mind that the biggest winners \u2013 whether the US in the early 1900s or China now \u2013 are those who break the free trade rules. Never mind that the actual forecasts for Ceta show the gains will be relatively meagre. Never mind that the studies cited don\u2019t bother to look at who wins and loses, and by how much. Most of all, ignore their shared assumption that after any deal the affected economies undergo a short, sharp shock before bouncing back. Anyone who has lived through the past eight years has heard that one before. After the financial crisis, the Bank of England and Treasury both kept forecasting a return to normal \u2013 and they kept getting it wrong. Eight years on, that bounceback hasn\u2019t materialised. British workers are still not paid as much after inflation as they were when Lehman Brothers collapsed. That assumption\u2019s lack of substance is called a \u201cdirty little secret\u201d by two independent economists, Pierre Kohler and Servaas Storm, in a recent paper scrutinising the likely effects of Ceta. As they say, it presumes that laid-off workers \u201cwill rapidly find new jobs\u201d \u2013 whatever the industry, however far away the employer. A car engineer can up sticks and turn into a software engineer. And if there aren\u2019t any actual jobs, they can deliver takeaways for Deliveroo. The assumptions are both laughably far-fetched and, in the cost citizens are expected to bear, disgusting. No wonder the EU would rather there was as little public discussion as possible. Using a model employed by the UN, Kohler and Storm found that the benefits of Ceta become microscopic next to the costs. For at least the first seven years after the agreement is brought in, unemployment will rise, wages will fall and economies will see their growth rates decline. Governments will lose revenue, and so increase austerity. The burden will fall hardest on the poorest, the lowest-skilled, older people and those with disabilities. A senior lecturer at Delft University of Technology, Storm summed up for me the consequences: \u201cThe weaker your position in an economy, the more strongly you\u2019ll feel the fall-out.\u201d These aren\u2019t people and regions who are left behind: they\u2019ve been chucked off the train by their own governments. This is the settlement free-traders, left and right, are fighting to impose on voters. Is it any wonder the voters keep plumping for alternatives \u2013 no matter how reprehensible, how ruinous? \u2022 You can catch up on the discussion we had on this article and others on our Your Opinions thread, which is now closed.",

          "bodyText": "European leaders will attempt to rescue the troubled EU-Canada trade pact on Friday, after ministers failed to find a compromise that would satisfy a Belgian regional parliament that is blocking the deal. Ministers from all 28 EU member states, including Belgium, on Tuesday pledged their support for the comprehensive economic and trade agreement (Ceta) with Canada. But hopes of approving the deal were dashed, in the face of implacable opposition from Wallonia, the Francophone region of Belgium. The Walloons\u2019 tough stance, which puts them at odds with Belgium\u2019s federal government and the wealthier Flemish region, means Ceta will be kicked up to an EU leaders\u2019 summit on Friday. Failure to reach an agreement by Friday would almost certainly force Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau to abandon an EU-Canada summit due to take place in Brussels on 27 October. Inside Brussels and many national capitals, this would be seen as humiliating outcome for Europe. \u201cThere has to be an agreement,\u201d said the EU trade commissioner, Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m. \u201cOur Canadian friends need to know whether to book their ticket or not.\u201d Belgium\u2019s foreign minister, Didier Reynders, said he hoped for progress at the EU summit. Trade was already on the summit agenda, with leaders due to discuss the divisive issue of punitive tariffs on Chinese steelmakers. Subsidised cheap steel has been flooding world markets, threatening the future of the industry across Europe, including at Port Talbot, but the EU has been unable to unite, with countries, including the UK blocking tough action. Now they will also be confronted with salvaging the EU-Canada trade deal, in order to avoid a damaging diplomatic fallout. Canada is increasingly impatient with the EU\u2019s last-minute doubts, over a trade deal the two sides began negotiating more than seven years ago. If Europe was unable to sign a \u201cprogressive trade deal with a country like Canada, then who does Europe think it can do business with in the years to come?\u201d Trudeau asked last week. Malmstr\u00f6m urged for talks on reforming EU trade policy. \u201cWe cannot have 28 countries negotiating, or 27,\u201d she said. While trade agreements had to be \u201cinclusive, transparent and efficient\u201d, they could not \u201cdrag on for years and years because then they lose their relevance\u201d. The numerous hurdles over Ceta suggest the complexities that await the British government, when it seeks to negotiate a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU. David Davis, secretary of state for Brexit, favours the EU-Canada deal as a model, while insisting the balance of negotiating power will lie with the UK. His colleague, Europe minister David Jones, told his EU counterparts in Luxembourg on Tuesday that the UK was \u201centhusiastically supportive\u201d of Ceta and hoped it would pave the way for future EU trade agreements, without mentioning Brexit. Even if the EU finds a solution with Wallonia, the Ceta agreement will only come into force on a temporary basis. Parts of the agreement will remain frozen, most notably a controversial court to enable investors to resolve disputes with national governments. In order to become a permanent and complete agreement, Ceta must also be ratified by 28 national parliaments and 10 other regional assemblies and upper houses. In an attempt to persuade the Walloons, the commission has drafted a legal declaration affirming the importance of national parliaments in ratifying the deal. This text, which would be bolted on to the 1,600-page treaty, also seeks to assuage concerns in Germany. Last week the German constitutional court gave its backing to Ceta, but added several conditions. One significant proviso would allow Germany to withdraw from the temporary treaty, if national parliaments chose not to ratify it. So far, this legal declaration has not convinced Walloon leader Paul Magnette, the man at the centre of the furore. Magnette, a political scientist who studied at the University of Cambridge, became Wallonia\u2019s minister-president in 2014, after stints in Belgium\u2019s national government. The leading political lights of the Francophone world have been urging him to back down, including French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, a fellow socialist, who supports Ceta, as well as senior Canadian and EU diplomats. Speaking to Walloon MPs on Monday, Magnette said he had encountered \u201cthinly-veiled threats\u201d, but refused to climb down. He argued that Ceta was weighted against European producers. \u201cWhy would Europeans not have the right to protect their markets against exports that would eventually threaten our sectors? This is what I am fighting for.\u201d The trade treaty comes at a sensitive time for Wallonia, a region of 3.5 million people, which has struggled with a legacy of industrial decline. Last month, the US firm Caterpillar, maker of diggers, drills and other machinery, announced it was closing its plant in a Charleroi suburb with the loss of 2,000 jobs, as part of a global cost-cutting plan. Magnette, also mayor of Charleroi, has accused Caterpillar of \u201crogue behaviour\u201d.",

          "bodyText": "The White House will roll out the red carpet for the Italian prime minister, Matteo Renzi, and his wife, Agnese, on Tuesday, marking the last formal dinner of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency and an important gesture in support of an embattled US ally. Many details of the state dinner \u2013 such as whether Michelle Obama will stay true to her habit of wearing relatively unknown designers for such occasions or opt for an Italian classic such as Giorgio Armani or Valentino \u2013 are still under wraps. What is known is that the food will be prepared by Mario Batali, an American chef known for refashioning Italian classics, and the entertainment will be provided by the singer Gwen Stefani. In the US capital the glamorous affair is keenly anticipated, with Renzi labelled the \u201cJustin Trudeau of Italy\u201d by the style section of the Washington Post. But it is the substance of Renzi\u2019s time in office that has endeared him to the White House. Following the UK\u2019s vote to leave the European Union and tensions between Angela Merkel and Obama over US spying allegations and trade, Renzi has emerged as the most important and vocal champion of the US-European relationship. The Italian prime minister is working closely with the US on supporting the UN-backed unity government in Libya, and has allowed the US to use American bases in Sicily to conduct drone strikes against Islamic State. While the US president may be feeling confident that his fellow Democrat Hillary Clinton will be elected as his successor on 8 November, Renzi is facing tougher odds in a contest that will make or break his own political career. The US has suggested that it supports Renzi and a yes vote in the 4 December referendum on constitutional reform in Italy, but polls are looking tough for the prime minister, who has staked his career on the outcome and promised to resign from politics if he loses. Among other advisers, Renzi has hired Jim Messina, Obama\u2019s former campaign manager. The Italian prime minister was also an early supporter of Clinton\u2019s bid for the presidency, even while she was locked in a nomination battle with Bernie Sanders. Giovanni Orsina, professor of contemporary history at LUISS University in Rome, said the decision to invite Renzi to the state dinner in Washington signalled a clear belief that the Italian referendum would have consequences beyond Italy\u2019s borders. The US ambassador to Italy, John Phillis, recently warned that a victory for the no camp would lead to political instability, and would be seen from abroad as weakening European cohesion. \u201cItalians, like others in the west, are becoming increasingly negative about other institutions meddling in Italian affairs. If voters feel pressed, they may end up doing the opposite,\u201d Orsina said. The trip to Washington will include a joint press conference with Obama \u2013 raising speculation that the pair could make a statement about Russia, a speech at Johns Hopkins University, a visit to Arlington national cemetery and a lunch arranged by the Center for American Progress, a Democratic thinktank. The Italian entourage accompanying Renzi will include Armani himself \u2013 apparently there are no hard feelings after the designer criticised Renzi\u2019s sense of style in 2014. Anti-corruption tsar Raffaele Cantone, Oscar winners actor Roberto Benigni and director Paolo Sorrentino, the mayor of the Italian island of Lampedusa, Giusi Nicolini, and Paralympic champion Bebe Vio, who won gold in fencing at the Rio Games, will also be there.",

EU trade ministers hope to sign the deal on Tuesday, but the outcome is in doubt after the Walloon parliament passed a resolution against it on Friday. The EU and Canada have spent seven years negotiating the comprehensive economic and trade agreement (CETA), which would eliminate tariffs on most goods between the two parties. But EU negotiators have said it can only go ahead with the unanimous agreement of all 28 member states. While several countries have raised last-minute problems, Belgium has become a stumbling block that threatens to bring down the deal. Belgium\u2019s federal government supports the trade deal but may be unable to give its consent because of opposition from the Socialist-led Walloon parliament, which has argued that the CETA gives too much power to multinationals. The problems in finalising the CETA hint at the political minefield that the British government will face in agreeing a free trade deal with the EU. Canada is running out of patience with the EU\u2019s problems in finalising the agreement, with formal negotiations having ended in August 2014. Speaking before the Walloon parliament vote on Thursday, the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said: \u201cIf we find in a week or two that Europe is incapable of signing a progressive trade deal with a country like Canada, then who does Europe think it can do business with in the years to come? \u201cIn this post-Brexit [vote] situation, where there are a great many questions about Europe\u2019s usefulness, if Europe cannot manage to sign this agreement, then that sends a very clear message.

But I\u2019m confident that there are so many strong European countries, like France as we saw, Germany is fully on board, and others, that this deal is going to make it through.\u201d His earlier words were echoed by European leaders, who are increasingly concerned that the EU\u2019s reputation as a trading bloc will be irretrievably damaged by failing to sign a deal with a close ally. Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, said \u201cemotions and confusion\u201d around the CETA and the parallel transatlantic trade and investment partnership (TTIP) with the US were \u201cfuel for Eurosceptics and radicals\u201d. One senior EU diplomat said: \u201cIt is not just about EU-Canada, it is about the future of EU trade policy.\u201d The European commission has drafted a declaration stating that European environmental and health standards will not be diluted. But this failed to convince the minister-president of Wallonia, Paul Magnette, who has vowed to stop Belgium from signing the deal. Insiders familiar with Belgium\u2019s intricate political system said it was possible for the executive to override the Walloon parliament. Last-ditch talks between Belgium\u2019s three regions and the federal government are scheduled for Monday. Even if ministers approve the CETA on Tuesday, this would not be the final hurdle: the agreement would have to be ratified by 28 national and 10 regional European parliaments. EU member states insisted on this final step of parliamentary ratification in a departure from tradition; previously, EU trade policy was signed off by national governments. Fredrik Erixon, the director of the European Centre for International Political Economy, said: \u201cWhat we are witnessing is a degrading of the authority of the EU to do a lot of things in these areas [trade and commercial policy].\u201d Allowing parliaments to ratify the agreement was \u201can extraordinary decision\u201d, he said. \u201cIt is setting a precedent and having a profoundly undermining effect on EU trade policy, because few countries in the world will want to do trade negotiations with us in the future.\u201d The Labour MEP David Martin, who sits on the European parliament trade committee, said the Wallonian response to the CETA should send shivers down the spine of Brexit negotiators in London. \u201cBritain\u2019s final deal with the EU will too be subject to the whim of 38 national and regional parliaments. As we have seen in Francophone Belgium, public opinion in the rest of Europe is volatile on questions of trade, and deluded Brexiteers will get a shock if they think our partners are going to give us an easy ride.\u201d Supporters of parliamentary ratification say leaving the decision to the EU would have been undemocratic, because the wide-ranging trade agreement affects national politicians\u2019 competences. The increasing role of national parliaments has complicated EU trade policy: the trend means that the parliament of Belgium\u2019s German-speaking community of 76,000 people could, in theory, block a trade agreement between the EU and the UK. EU leaders have suggested that it could take five years or longer to negotiate a free trade agreement with the UK. Erixon said it was too early to tell because the British government had not spelled out its stance on key economic issues that would affect a trade deal, such as farming subsidies, environmental standards and financial services. \u201cNo one really knows yet what we are going to negotiate about. I don\u2019t think the [UK] government knows yet,\u201d he said.",

As justice minister in the early 1990s, Campbell was instrumental in reforming Canada\u2019s sexual assault laws, and in an interview on Tuesday, she lashed out Trump\u2019s remarks on kissing women and grabbing them without permission. \u201cUnconsented sexual touching is a sexual assault,\u201d Campbell told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. \u201cAnd somebody who does that, who thinks he has a right to do that, who does it thinking that it\u2019s a reflection of his value because he\u2019s a celebrity, et cetera, I mean that is predation.\u201d Trump\u2019s comments could hold wider, more troubling implications for women across the United States, warned Campbell. \u201cHe has released a wave of misogynistic rhetoric in the guise of being opposed to political correctness,\u201d she said. \u201cThe giving permission of people to express the worst misogynistic attitudes is incredibly dangerous and very, very worrisome.\u201d As news of the leaked tape broke, Trump issued an apology and said he regretted his words. During Sunday\u2019s presidential debate, he dismissed his remarks as simply run-of-the-mill \u201clocker room talk\u201d. The US presidential campaign has seen Canadian politicians from across the spectrum publicly air their concerns regarding Trump\u2019s candidacy \u2013 with one notable exception. The country\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau \u2013 a self-described feminist \u2013 has repeatedly shied away from weighing in with his thoughts on the US election. On Wednesday a spokesperson for Trudeau reiterated that there would be no comment on the presidential election. Campbell said Trudeau\u2019s stance was not surprising. \u201cJustin Trudeau is a sitting prime minister of Canada and normally we don\u2019t like it when other governments wade into our elections.\u201d Any perception of interference could be magnified given Trump\u2019s repeated claims that if he loses the election in November, it will be due to a \u201crigged\u201d system. \u201cThe idea of delegitimizing the results, as a result of his own vanity, is something that he has taken on and it is very dangerous,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cThe notion that you would want to open a wound and encourage people \u2026 to believe somehow an election was stolen from their candidate is really a crime against democracy.\u201d",

          "bodyText": "The last time the Perimeter Institute and quantum technology appeared on this blog was when Justin Trudeau visited, and gave a much-discussed potted explanation of quantum computing. This evening Michele Mosca will give a lecture on how we have moved from understanding quantum physics to using it in the development of new technologies and in doing new science. He will also speculate on what this might lead to next. The live webcast will appear below, and will be replaced by a recording shortly after the event. Jon Butterworth\u2019s book Smashing Physics is available as \u201cMost Wanted Particle\u201d in Canada &amp; the US and was shortlisted for the Royal Society Winton Prize for Science Books.",

The whirlwind visit of British Columbia and the Yukon has made headlines around the world, from Prince George\u2019s rebuff of Justin Trudeau, Canada\u2019s prime minister, to the royal couple\u2019s sojourn in a three-star Whitehorse hotel best known for the 40ft wooden Mountie that looms over its parking lot. But one theme emerged dominant as the royals made their way through an itinerary billed by Kensington Palace as one to \u201ccelebrate Canada\u2019s First Nations community, its art and culture\u201d \u2013 that of reconciliation, as frustrated First Nations leaders urged the royals to help mend the fractured relationship left in the wake of British colonisation. \u201cTrue reconciliation involves the honour of the Crown, the federal government, the provincial government and the indigenous people of this land,\u201d Chief Jonathan Kruger of the Penticton Indian Band told the couple as they visited Syilx Nation\u2019s traditional territory on Tuesday. \u201cTrue power is human spirit,\u201d he continued. \u201cPlease use that power to advocate for true reconciliation and advocate for the Indigenous people in this country so they can be all great and good.\u201d Indigenous Canadians \u2013 who make up about 4% of the country\u2019s population \u2013 grapple with poverty, imprisonment and suicide at rates much higher than those of non-Indigenous Canadians.

          "body": "<p>Canada\u2019s commitment to fighting climate change has been questioned after the Liberal government, led by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/justin-trudeau\">Justin Trudeau</a>, announced conditional approval for a C$36bn liquefied natural gas project in northern British Columbia.<br></p> <p>The decision \u2013 the Trudeau government\u2019s first on a major energy project \u2013 was announced late on Tuesday. \u201cThe government approved the Pacific NorthWest LNG project,\u201d Catherine McKenna, the environment minister, told reporters in a Vancouver suburb. </p> <p>Backed by Malaysia\u2019s energy giant Petronas, the project would ship 19m tonnes a year of frozen, liquefied natural gas to markets in Asia. The government promised the project, one of Canada\u2019s largest resource development projects, would create thousands of jobs \u2013 as many as 630 direct and spin-off jobs and 4,500 construction jobs \u2013 and add nearly C$2.4bn per year to the country\u2019s GDP. </p> <p>The government\u2019s approval was contingent on the project meeting 190 conditions, including keeping greenhouse gas emissions capped at 4.3m tonnes per year, a drop of about 20% from the project\u2019s initial proposal. Upstream emissions are not included in this cap and could add as much as 8.7m tonnes of carbon emissions to the project, according to estimates from a draft report released by the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency in February. </p> <p>McKenna said the decision had been informed by rigorous environmental assessment as well as meaningful consultations with First Nations groups. \u201cThe only way to get resources to market in the 21st century is if it is done in a responsible and sustainable manner. This decision reflects this objective.\u201d </p> <p>But despite claims by the British Columbia government that the exported fuel would offer an alternative to coal-fired plants in Asia, environmentalists warned the approval of the project would undermine Canada\u2019s climate change commitments.</p> <p>\u201cHow can Prime Minister Trudeau claim to be a climate leader on the international stage, while approving this new project that will become the single largest source of climate pollution in the country?\u201d Karen Mahon of Stand Earth asked in a statement after the decision was announced. \u201cHonestly we expected better.\u201d</p> <p>Since taking the reins of Canada\u2019s government last year, Trudeau has sought to position himself <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/08/barack-obama-and-justin-trudeau-to-join-forces-on-climate-change\">as a climate change leader on the world stage</a> while assuring Canadians that the government would strike a balance between caring for the environment and bolstering the country\u2019s struggling energy industry. </p> <p>The Pacific NorthWest LNG project, which includes a nearly 600-mile (900km) natural gas pipeline and an LNG facility near Prince Rupert in British Columbia, was widely seen as one of the government\u2019s first tests of this commitment. </p> <p>During last year\u2019s federal election campaign, Trudeau courted environmentalists with promises to invest millions of dollars in clean tech and confront climate change.</p> <p>Tuesday\u2019s approval was a betrayal to the many who voted for action on climate change, said Caitlyn Vernon of the Sierra Club of British Columbia. \u201cThe Trudeau government\u2019s lofty rhetoric on climate has been proven nothing more than sunny ways talking points.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/22/pipelines-alberta-oil-sands-aboriginal-tribes\">Canadian and US tribes band together to fight Alberta oil sands pipelines</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In May, 90 scientists and climate experts from Canada, the US and Australia urged Trudeau and his government to reject the Pacific NorthWest LNG project <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/314292821/Climate-Scientists-Letter-to-Federal-Government\">in an open letter</a>. The 190 conditions set out by the government provided a chance to meaningfully address some of the concerns, said Merran Smith of Clean Energy Canada. Instead, the bar was set too low. \u201cWhat\u2019s shocking about this approval is that other LNG projects are proposing much cleaner operations,\u201d she said. \u201cOttawa should have required Pacific NorthWest to run on clean electricity and use available technology to reduce its carbon pollution by more than 40%.\u201d </p> <p>Even before the government announced its decision, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/true-north/2016/mar/20/by-rejecting-1-billion-for-a-pipeline-a-first-nation-has-put-justin-trudeaus-climate-plan-on-trial\">six First Nations affected by the project said</a> the project had so far failed to meet their expectations for respecting indigenous rights. \u201cProviding a green light for this project at this time will only lead to protracted litigation which benefits no one,\u201d the Skeena Corridor Nations said in a statement. </p> <p>In the wake of Tuesday\u2019s announcement, analysts pointed out there was little guarantee that the project would be built. The government\u2019s decision comes amid weakening demand and oversupply in the global natural gas market. While those behind the project welcomed the approval and described it as a significant milestone, the company said a total review of the project would be carried out by the company and shareholders before any final decision is taken.</p>",

The decision \u2013 the Trudeau government\u2019s first on a major energy project \u2013 was announced late on Tuesday. \u201cThe government approved the Pacific NorthWest LNG project,\u201d Catherine McKenna, the environment minister, told reporters in a Vancouver suburb. Backed by Malaysia\u2019s energy giant Petronas, the project would ship 19m tonnes a year of frozen, liquefied natural gas to markets in Asia. The government promised the project, one of Canada\u2019s largest resource development projects, would create thousands of jobs \u2013 as many as 630 direct and spin-off jobs and 4,500 construction jobs \u2013 and add nearly C$2.4bn per year to the country\u2019s GDP. The government\u2019s approval was contingent on the project meeting 190 conditions, including keeping greenhouse gas emissions capped at 4.3m tonnes per year, a drop of about 20% from the project\u2019s initial proposal. Upstream emissions are not included in this cap and could add as much as 8.7m tonnes of carbon emissions to the project, according to estimates from a draft report released by the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency in February. McKenna said the decision had been informed by rigorous environmental assessment as well as meaningful consultations with First Nations groups. \u201cThe only way to get resources to market in the 21st century is if it is done in a responsible and sustainable manner. This decision reflects this objective.\u201d But despite claims by the British Columbia government that the exported fuel would offer an alternative to coal-fired plants in Asia, environmentalists warned the approval of the project would undermine Canada\u2019s climate change commitments. \u201cHow can Prime Minister Trudeau claim to be a climate leader on the international stage, while approving this new project that will become the single largest source of climate pollution in the country?\u201d Karen Mahon of Stand Earth asked in a statement after the decision was announced. \u201cHonestly we expected better.\u201d Since taking the reins of Canada\u2019s government last year, Trudeau has sought to position himself as a climate change leader on the world stage while assuring Canadians that the government would strike a balance between caring for the environment and bolstering the country\u2019s struggling energy industry. The Pacific NorthWest LNG project, which includes a nearly 600-mile (900km) natural gas pipeline and an LNG facility near Prince Rupert in British Columbia, was widely seen as one of the government\u2019s first tests of this commitment. During last year\u2019s federal election campaign, Trudeau courted environmentalists with promises to invest millions of dollars in clean tech and confront climate change. Tuesday\u2019s approval was a betrayal to the many who voted for action on climate change, said Caitlyn Vernon of the Sierra Club of British Columbia. \u201cThe Trudeau government\u2019s lofty rhetoric on climate has been proven nothing more than sunny ways talking points.\u201d In May, 90 scientists and climate experts from Canada, the US and Australia urged Trudeau and his government to reject the Pacific NorthWest LNG project in an open letter. The 190 conditions set out by the government provided a chance to meaningfully address some of the concerns, said Merran Smith of Clean Energy Canada. Instead, the bar was set too low. \u201cWhat\u2019s shocking about this approval is that other LNG projects are proposing much cleaner operations,\u201d she said. \u201cOttawa should have required Pacific NorthWest to run on clean electricity and use available technology to reduce its carbon pollution by more than 40%.\u201d Even before the government announced its decision, six First Nations affected by the project said the project had so far failed to meet their expectations for respecting indigenous rights. \u201cProviding a green light for this project at this time will only lead to protracted litigation which benefits no one,\u201d the Skeena Corridor Nations said in a statement. In the wake of Tuesday\u2019s announcement, analysts pointed out there was little guarantee that the project would be built. The government\u2019s decision comes amid weakening demand and oversupply in the global natural gas market. While those behind the project welcomed the approval and described it as a significant milestone, the company said a total review of the project would be carried out by the company and shareholders before any final decision is taken.",

We were privileged to be part of his private family, but today we sense that the entire nation of Israel and the global community share this great loss. We share this pain together.\u201d</p> <p>World leaders paid tribute to his legacy. US President Barack Obama said of his life: \u201cThere are few people who we share this world with who change the course of human history, not just through their role in human events, but because they expand our moral imagination and force us to expect more of ourselves. My friend Shimon was one of those people.\u201d</p> <p>Bill Clinton, the US President on whose White House lawns the Oslo Accords were famously signed, wrote: </p> <p>\u201cI will miss Shimon Peres, my brilliant and eloquent friend. His life was a blessing to all who strive for peace.\u201d </p> <p>Israel\u2019s current prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara expressed \u201cdeep personal sorrow over the passing of the nation\u2019s beloved former president\u201d.</p> <p>But his career, and his legacy, was controversial. Peres\u2019s critics condemned his hawkish drive to build Israel\u2019s nuclear weapons program, his support for illegal settlements in the West Bank, and advocacy for the blockade of Gaza. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/28/shimon-peres-obituary\">The Guardian\u2019s obituary</a> described him as a leader who \u201cengendered controversy\u201d:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Peres was an intriguingly contradictory figure: a romantic in a cynical age, an Israeli icon with a Polish accent and francophone sensibility, who carried about him the taint (deserved or otherwise) of political chicanery. Unlike holiness, he told <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/sep/01/sir-david-frost\">David Frost</a>, politics is built on compromise.</p> </blockquote> <p>Peres was an advocate for a two-state solution.

He would have still had achieved more to build Israel\u2019s security than nearly anyone else alive.</p> <p>He could have resigned from the Knesset in the mid-1960s, following his mentor and patron David Ben-Gurion. Still in his early 40s, instead of languishing on the backbenchers, a lucrative future in business was open to him, as the man who had negotiated Israel\u2019s most crucial arms and technology deals, and had laid the foundations for its defense industry.</p> <p>In 1977, when he lost the election to Menachem Begin and Likud first came to power, the correct thing would have been to make way for a new generation of Labor Party leaders. But he soldiered on a leader of the opposition, despite another humiliating defeat in 1981.</p> <p>The crushing loss in 1996, by a fraction of a point to Benjamin Netanyahu, should have been another clear signal that his time was up. And again, four years later when he lost in a secret ballot for the presidency against political nonentity Moshe Katzav, he kept on going, even when he seemed pathetic to everyone around.</p> <p>Even when he was pushed by younger prime ministers in to minor cabinet posts way beneath his experience. Even when he twice felt forced to leave the party he had served for over six decades. Even when his last hurrah, a second and finally successful run for president, meant separating from his wife Sonia and leading their last years apart.</p> <p>On the way he broke nearly all the Israeli political records of longevity. He served as Knesset member for over 47 years, no one else comes even close. He is the only man to have ever served in all four top government jobs \u2212 defense, foreign and finance minister, as well as prime minister.

          "bodyText": "Here we end our rolling coverage of reaction to the death of former Israeli president Shimon Peres. Please see Guardian correspondent Peter Beaumont\u2019s coverage here, and The Guardian\u2019s obituary here. Shimon Peres, one of the founding fathers of Israel and a man \u201cat or near the centre of action\u201d for his country\u2019s entire modern history, has died aged 93. Peres, Israel\u2019s defence, finance, and prime minister (twice) and president for seven years, did more than almost any figure in the country\u2019s history to build up its formidable military might, then dedicated decades of his life trying to forge a lasting peace with the nation\u2019s neighbours. Peres was a key architect of the 1993 Oslo Accords, and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1994. He died in Jerusalem in the early hours of Wednesday morning, having suffered a stroke two weeks ago. His family led condolences, his son Chemi saying: \u201cour father\u2019s legacy has always been to look to tomorrow. We were privileged to be part of his private family, but today we sense that the entire nation of Israel and the global community share this great loss. We share this pain together.\u201d World leaders paid tribute to his legacy. US President Barack Obama said of his life: \u201cThere are few people who we share this world with who change the course of human history, not just through their role in human events, but because they expand our moral imagination and force us to expect more of ourselves. My friend Shimon was one of those people.\u201d Bill Clinton, the US President on whose White House lawns the Oslo Accords were famously signed, wrote: \u201cI will miss Shimon Peres, my brilliant and eloquent friend. His life was a blessing to all who strive for peace.\u201d Israel\u2019s current prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara expressed \u201cdeep personal sorrow over the passing of the nation\u2019s beloved former president\u201d. But his career, and his legacy, was controversial. Peres\u2019s critics condemned his hawkish drive to build Israel\u2019s nuclear weapons program, his support for illegal settlements in the West Bank, and advocacy for the blockade of Gaza. The Guardian\u2019s obituary described him as a leader who \u201cengendered controversy\u201d: Peres was an intriguingly contradictory figure: a romantic in a cynical age, an Israeli icon with a Polish accent and francophone sensibility, who carried about him the taint (deserved or otherwise) of political chicanery. Unlike holiness, he told David Frost, politics is built on compromise. Peres was an advocate for a two-state solution. He said Palestine, Israel\u2019s closest neighbour, \u201cmay become our closest friend\u201d. If you have children, you cannot feed them forever with flags for breakfast and cartridges for lunch. You need something more substantial. Unless you educate your children and spend less money on conflicts, unless you develop your science, technology and industry, you don\u2019t have a future. It has been reported in Jerusalem that Peres\u2019s body will lie in state at the Knesset on Thursday. Members of the public will be invited to pay their respects The country\u2019s ninth president, he will be buried at Mt Herzl, at a plot reserved for Israel\u2019s founding fathers. Reports from Jerusalem this morning state the funeral for Shimon Peres will take place on Friday morning. On Thursday, his body will lie in state at the Knesset. Members of the public will be able to attend to pay respects. The Jerusalem Post reports Peres will likely be buried at Mt Herzl, at a plot reserved for the country\u2019s founding fathers. An interesting take on Peres\u2019s political ambition from Haaretz columnist Anshel Pfeffer, says Guardian correspondent Peter Beaumont: Shimon Peres could have respectfully retired from political life at so many points in his career. He would have still had achieved more to build Israel\u2019s security than nearly anyone else alive. He could have resigned from the Knesset in the mid-1960s, following his mentor and patron David Ben-Gurion. Still in his early 40s, instead of languishing on the backbenchers, a lucrative future in business was open to him, as the man who had negotiated Israel\u2019s most crucial arms and technology deals, and had laid the foundations for its defense industry. In 1977, when he lost the election to Menachem Begin and Likud first came to power, the correct thing would have been to make way for a new generation of Labor Party leaders. But he soldiered on a leader of the opposition, despite another humiliating defeat in 1981. The crushing loss in 1996, by a fraction of a point to Benjamin Netanyahu, should have been another clear signal that his time was up. And again, four years later when he lost in a secret ballot for the presidency against political nonentity Moshe Katzav, he kept on going, even when he seemed pathetic to everyone around. Even when he was pushed by younger prime ministers in to minor cabinet posts way beneath his experience. Even when he twice felt forced to leave the party he had served for over six decades. Even when his last hurrah, a second and finally successful run for president, meant separating from his wife Sonia and leading their last years apart. On the way he broke nearly all the Israeli political records of longevity. He served as Knesset member for over 47 years, no one else comes even close. He is the only man to have ever served in all four top government jobs \u2212 defense, foreign and finance minister, as well as prime minister. He had reached the top again and again, won the Nobel Peace Prize. But it was never enough and he always wanted to keep going. Meanwhile Yaakov Katz in the Jerusalem Post has this take on Peres\u2019s wars and his political disappointments. In his 93 years, Peres saw it all and was at every major juncture this country went through in its 68 years of statehood. On the night of November 29, 1947, when the UN voted on the Partition Plan, Peres sat with David Ben-Gurion, Israel\u2019s first prime minister. \u201cToday they dance,\u201d Ben-Gurion said that night. \u201cTomorrow there will be war.\u201d There were many wars, and Peres played a role in them all. Throughout his career he dreamed, always looking at failures as opportunities. While political opponents called him the \u201ceternal loser\u201d for his failure to win several elections, he never let the losses linger. The next day he would be back at work, thinking up new ways to advance the country. While others viewed his dreams as na\u00efve policy-making \u2013 especially with regards to the Palestinians and the Oslo Accords \u2013 Peres refused to give up on peace and the opportunities he believed it would afford the Jewish State. Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull \u201cShimon Peres was a fierce defender of Israel\u2019s security and its ability to defend itself. He was equally a tireless advocate for peace.\u201d Shimon Peres, one of the founding fathers of Israel and a man \u201cat or near the centre of action\u201d for his country\u2019s entire modern history, has died aged 93. Peres, Israel\u2019s defence, finance, and prime minister (twice) and president for seven years, did more than almost any figure in the country\u2019s history to build up its formidable military might, then dedicated decades of his life trying to forge a lasting peace with the nation\u2019s neighbours. Peres was a key architect of the 1993 Oslo Accords, and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1994. He died in Jerusalem in the early hours of Wednesday morning, having suffered a stroke two weeks ago. His son Chemi confirmed his death: \u201cToday with deep sorrow we bid farewell to our beloved father, the ninth president of Israel\u201d. \u201cOur father\u2019s legacy has always been to look to tomorrow. We were privileged to be part of his private family, but today we sense that the entire nation of Israel and the global community share this great loss. We share this pain together.\u201d \u201cToday with deep sorrow we bid farewell to our beloved father, the 9th president of Israel,\u201d Peres\u2019s son Chemi said at the medical centre where his father was being treated in the final days of his life. \u201cOur father\u2019s legacy has always been to look to tomorrow. We were privileged to be part of his private family, but today we sense that the entire nation of Israel and the global community share this great loss. We share this pain together.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s obituary says \u201cever since the state of Israel was created in 1948, Shimon Peres... was at or near the centre of action\u201d. Peres was an intriguingly contradictory figure: a romantic in a cynical age, an Israeli icon with a Polish accent and francophone sensibility, who carried about him the taint (deserved or otherwise) of political chicanery. Unlike holiness, he told David Frost, politics is built on compromise. \u201cPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara express deep personal sorrow over the passing of the nation\u2019s beloved former president, Shimon Peres,\u201d a statement issued by the office of the prime minister reads. \u201cThe prime minister will deliver a special address this morning and convene the cabinet for a mourning session.\u201d Rafi Walden, Peres\u2019s son-in-law and his physician, said the former prime minister and president \u201cleft us without suffering\u201d. He said world leaders who met Peres in his final years would pay deference to the statesman \u201clike students standing before the rabbi eager to learn his lessons\u201d. Chemi Peres on his late father: He was one of the founding fathers of the state of Israel and served our people before we even had a country. He worked tirelessly for Israel from the very first day of the state to the last day of his life. Shimon Peres\u2019s son Chemi is speaking to media now... Sultan al Qassemi, the prolific Emirati commentator, and founder of the Barjeel Art Foundation, was among those who were less flattering in their assessment of Peres, referring to the 1996 Qana massacre when 106 people were killed by israeli shelling at a UN compound. On the Oslo Accords: What we are doing today is more than signing an agreement: it is a revolution. Yesterday a dream, today a commitment. On the unsustainability of conflict with Israel\u2019s neighbours: If you have children, you cannot feed them forever with flags for breakfast and cartridges for lunch. You need something more substantial. Unless you educate your children and spend less money on conflicts, unless you develop your science, technology and industry, you don\u2019t have a future. On his own public approval: For 60 years, I was the most controversial figure in the country, and suddenly I\u2019m the most popular man in the land. Truth be told, I don\u2019t know when I was happier, then or now. On a two-state solution: A firm basis already exists. A solution of two national states - a Jewish state, Israel; an Arab state, Palestine. The Palestinians are our closest neighbours. I believe they may become our closest friends. On peace: Peace with the Palestinians will open ports of peace all around the Mediterranean. The duty of leaders is to pursue freedom ceaselessly, even in the face of hostility, in the face of doubt and disappointment. Just imagine what could be. On peace... and breakfast: It is unfortunate, but as you know, you can make eggs into omelettes but you cannot make omelettes back into eggs. Reflections on the legacy of of Shimon Peres continue to flow from across the world, much of it praise, but Peres was a controversial figure throughout his lifetime. Bill and Hillary Clinton praised a \u201ctrue and treasured friend\u201d But in the Middle East Monitor, Ben White writes that Peres\u2019s hawkish drive to build Israel\u2019s nuclear weapons program, his support for illegal settlements in the West Bank, and advocacy for the blockade of Gaza have been glossed over or forgotten by many in the West, who regard him as a \u201ctireless dove\u201d. The Guardian\u2019s obituary described Peres as a leader who \u201cengendered controversy\u201d, opining too, \u201cthere was something tragic about the man\u201d. Peres was an intriguingly contradictory figure: a romantic in a cynical age, an Israeli icon with a Polish accent and francophone sensibility, who carried about him the taint (deserved or otherwise) of political chicanery. Unlike holiness, he told David Frost, politics is built on compromise. I am going to hand over to my colleague Ben Doherty now. He will continue to update as more reaction comes in from around the world. Peres\u2019s family is due to speak to the media in about half an hour. The statement said Peres was one of the \u201c few people who we share this world with who change the course of human history, not just through their role in human events, but because they expand our moral imagination and force us to expect more of ourselves. My friend Shimon was one of those people.\u201d Shimon was the essence of Israel itself\u2014the courage of Israel\u2019s fight for independence, the optimism he shared with his wife Sonya as they helped make the desert bloom, and the perseverance that led him to serve his nation in virtually every position in government across the entire life of the State of Israel. As Americans, we are in his debt because, having worked with every U.S. president since John F. Kennedy, no one did more over so many years as Shimon Peres to build the alliance between our two countries\u2014an unbreakable alliance that today is closer and stronger than it has ever been. Here is the statement in full: AFP have out together a list of the key dates in the life of Shimon Peres - August 2 1923: Born Shimon Persky at Vishneva in what was then Poland and is now Belarus, he later took the Hebrew name Peres, meaning eagle. - 1934: Arrival in British mandatory Palestine. - 1959: Elected a member of parliament for Mapai, which would later become the Labour party. - 1984-1986: Prime minister of a Labour-Likud government of national unity. - 1993: Oversees secret negotiations with the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) which lead to the signing of the Oslo accords. - 1994: Awarded the Nobel Peace Prize along with Yitzhak Rabin (assassinated November 1995) and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat (died November 2004) for their role in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. - 1995: Succeeds Rabin after his murder on November 4 as premier and head of the Labour party. - June 2007: Elected Israel\u2019s ninth president. - July 2014: Stands down as president nine days before his 91st birthday and during the Gaza war, handing over his duties to Reuven Rivlin. Ted Cruz, the US Republican senator, has released a statement paying tribute to Peres\u2019s \u201cexceptional service to the Jewish state\u201d and his \u201cenduring friendship with the United States.\u201d \u201cMy thoughts and prayers are with his family and our close ally Israel. May his memory be a blessing,\u201d the statement said. Former US president George HW Bush has lauded Peres\u2019s \u201csingular life of service \u2013 to the universal cause of freedom, to the timeless cause of Israel, to the noblest cause of peace.\u201d In a statement sent to the Guardian he said: By his unyielding determination and principle, Shimon Peres time and again helped guide his beloved country through the crucible of mortal challenge. But it was by his innate humanity, his decency, that Shimon inspired the world over and helped pave a path to peace broad enough that future generations will walk it one day, side-by side.\u201d Mexican president Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto has sent his condolences to Peres\u2019s family and the Israeli nation. Peres\u2019s death has been confirmed by by his son-in-law and doctor Rafi Walden who said that the statesman died around 3am on Wednesday morning. World leaders have started to send their tributes to Peres. The Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau posted on Twitter that Peres was \u201cabove all, a man of peace\u201d. Peres died at 3.40 am in the Tel Hashomer hospital near Tel Aviv where he had ben treated since suffering a stroke on September 13 surrounded by his family who told Israel radio he was \u201cfighting until the end.\u201d Our picture desk has collated a gallery images from the life of Shimon Peres. Peres\u2019s family are due to hold a press conference, where they are expected to confirm his death, at 7am in Israel (in about one and a half hours\u2019s time). The government-run Israel News Agency has confirmed that Shimon Peres, who twice served as prime minister of Israel and later as the country\u2019s ninth president, has died following a stroke. We will collate reaction from around the world as it comes in. Here you can read more about Peres\u2019s life and his legacy, by Jerusalem correspondent Peter Beaumont.",

          "body": "<p>An unlikely alliance of the Queen, Prince William, the Labour MP Frank Field, Commonwealth countries and Canadian ecologists join forces today to protect one of the largest coastal temperate rainforests in the world: the <a href=\"http://www.hellobc.com/great-bear-rainforest.aspx\">Great Bear rainforest</a> along the central and west coast of British Columbia.</p> <p>Prince William is in the Canadian province for a weeklong visit and will announce on Monday that the forest will join an international network of forests designed to involve all 53 countries in the Commonwealth.</p> <p>The network of forests is part of the <a href=\"http://queenscommonwealthcanopy.org/\">Queen\u2019s Commonwealth Canopy</a> (QCC), a forest conservation initiative launched in the monarch\u2019s name at the Malta Commonwealth summit last year. </p> <p>Field said: \u201cThe aim is to form a network and collective voice that rivals the Amazonian rainforest in size, and makes a permanent contribution to fight against climate change. The existence of many Commonwealth nations is directly imperilled by climate change, and this is now a subject that is at the heart of the Commonwealth\u2019s purpose.\u201d </p> <p>Field, better known for his campaigning work in the field of welfare, launched the Cool Earth charity in 2007 with the businessman Johan Eliasch, with the aim of providing local people with an alternative to quick cash from loggers. </p> <p>The charity has worked with indigenous communities in Peru, Ecuador and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to put local people back in control of the forest.</p> <p>Since the Commonwealth was created in 1949, nearly half of its forest has been lost, about a quarter depleted and the remainder has been at great risk. The Commonwealth forest still represents as much as 20% of the world\u2019s total. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"db3594db0bd08207ddf6841d2e27a133204e09df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/db3594db0bd08207ddf6841d2e27a133204e09df/0_107_3936_2361/1000.jpg\" alt=\"British Columbia passed legislation this year to protect the Great Bear forest from industrial logging.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">British Columbia passed legislation this year to protect the Great Bear forest from industrial logging.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julie Picardi/Barcroft Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The aim of the network, apart from accrediting sustainable forestry schemes within the Commonwealth, is to combine knowledge on how best to preserve the forests. It may also give the Commonwealth greater relevance as it searches for an expanded role in the context of Brexit. <br></p> <p>Ministers are desperate to show energy in international forums in an effort to show that the referendum result does not signal isolation for Britain.</p> <p>The Great Bear rainforest is regarded as a globally significant area covering 6.4m hectares along the central and north coast of British Columbia, stretching from Vancouver to Alaska. It is home to a quarter of the earth\u2019s temperate rainforest. </p> <p>Increasingly threatened by industrial logging, the government of British Columbia passed historic legislation this year to protect the rainforest\u2019s ecology and indigenous people. About 85% of the land will be permanently protected from logging, and British Columbia claims the logging will only be carried out under the strictest rules.</p> <p>Michael Lake, the director of the Royal Commonwealth Society, said: \u201cThe ecosystem-based management regime for British Columbia\u2019s Great Bear rainforest, developed in collaboration with First Nations, industry and environmental organisations, provides an example that other Commonwealth countries can look to when pursuing their own forest conservation agendas.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/24/canada-nestle-water-well-bid-centre-wellington\">Canadian town steams over Nestl\u00e9 bid to control local spring water well</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Canada\u2019s commitment to the Canopy joins those previously received by Antigua and Barbuda, Australia, Belize, Jamaica, Malta, Mauritius, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Seychelles, Singapore, Sri Lanka, the United Kingdom and Zambia.<br></p> <p>Parcels of private land are scattered throughout the Great Bear rainforest, but are going to opt to be protected as part of the plan.</p> <p>The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are due on Monday to visit Bella Bella on British Columbia\u2019s remote central coast and fly over the Great Bear rainforest. </p> <p>It is generally accepted that efforts to save the Amazonian forests had been making some progress until recently.

          "bodyText": "An unlikely alliance of the Queen, Prince William, the Labour MP Frank Field, Commonwealth countries and Canadian ecologists join forces today to protect one of the largest coastal temperate rainforests in the world: the Great Bear rainforest along the central and west coast of British Columbia. Prince William is in the Canadian province for a weeklong visit and will announce on Monday that the forest will join an international network of forests designed to involve all 53 countries in the Commonwealth. The network of forests is part of the Queen\u2019s Commonwealth Canopy (QCC), a forest conservation initiative launched in the monarch\u2019s name at the Malta Commonwealth summit last year. Field said: \u201cThe aim is to form a network and collective voice that rivals the Amazonian rainforest in size, and makes a permanent contribution to fight against climate change. The existence of many Commonwealth nations is directly imperilled by climate change, and this is now a subject that is at the heart of the Commonwealth\u2019s purpose.\u201d Field, better known for his campaigning work in the field of welfare, launched the Cool Earth charity in 2007 with the businessman Johan Eliasch, with the aim of providing local people with an alternative to quick cash from loggers. The charity has worked with indigenous communities in Peru, Ecuador and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to put local people back in control of the forest. Since the Commonwealth was created in 1949, nearly half of its forest has been lost, about a quarter depleted and the remainder has been at great risk. The Commonwealth forest still represents as much as 20% of the world\u2019s total. The aim of the network, apart from accrediting sustainable forestry schemes within the Commonwealth, is to combine knowledge on how best to preserve the forests. It may also give the Commonwealth greater relevance as it searches for an expanded role in the context of Brexit. Ministers are desperate to show energy in international forums in an effort to show that the referendum result does not signal isolation for Britain. The Great Bear rainforest is regarded as a globally significant area covering 6.4m hectares along the central and north coast of British Columbia, stretching from Vancouver to Alaska. It is home to a quarter of the earth\u2019s temperate rainforest. Increasingly threatened by industrial logging, the government of British Columbia passed historic legislation this year to protect the rainforest\u2019s ecology and indigenous people. About 85% of the land will be permanently protected from logging, and British Columbia claims the logging will only be carried out under the strictest rules. Michael Lake, the director of the Royal Commonwealth Society, said: \u201cThe ecosystem-based management regime for British Columbia\u2019s Great Bear rainforest, developed in collaboration with First Nations, industry and environmental organisations, provides an example that other Commonwealth countries can look to when pursuing their own forest conservation agendas.\u201d Canada\u2019s commitment to the Canopy joins those previously received by Antigua and Barbuda, Australia, Belize, Jamaica, Malta, Mauritius, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Seychelles, Singapore, Sri Lanka, the United Kingdom and Zambia. Parcels of private land are scattered throughout the Great Bear rainforest, but are going to opt to be protected as part of the plan. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are due on Monday to visit Bella Bella on British Columbia\u2019s remote central coast and fly over the Great Bear rainforest. It is generally accepted that efforts to save the Amazonian forests had been making some progress until recently. However, Brazil\u2019s Mato Grosso and Para states are now seen as centres of illegal deforestation. Data released last month suggested deforestation in Brazil has reached its highest level since 2009.",

The UN has insisted there are no forced returns.</p> <p>At a later summit on refugees, hosted by US president Barack Obama, May said another \u00a380m from the aid budget will be aimed at helping migrants, largely Eritreans, stay in Ethiopia through the financial support for the construction of new industrial parks offering 100,000 new jobs, including 30,000 for refugees. </p> <p>This is an expansion of the programme used in Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon to try encourage refugees settle in the region rather than make journeys to European countries.</p> <p>Of the 124,000 refugees who crossed the Mediterranean to Italy between Jan 2016 and 12 Sept, 12% were Eritrean - second only to Nigeria who made up 20% of the numbers crossing.</p> <p>At the Obama summit, May also announced that more of the UK\u2019s aid budget would be spent on humanitarian efforts.</p> <p>A UK official said \u00a31.5bn for the year would be going towards refugees and others in dire need which is an extra 10% uplift from the aid budget. About \u00a32.5m will go to an international fund to help resettle refugees in other countries.</p> <p>However, May unveiled no new commitments for the UK to take in more than the 20,000 vulnerable Syrians who David Cameron agreed to accept by 2020, despite calls from charities and Labour for Britain to do more.</p> <p>Speaking ahead of the summit, May argued it was better to help a greater number of refugees at camps in countries bordering Syria than to resettle a smaller number in the UK. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-09-20T21:45:31.822Z\">at 10.45pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-57e1a41fe4b05714d0da2cba\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/patrick-kingsley\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-20T21:27:07.903Z\">10.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>More from Patrick Kingsley from the leaders\u2019 summit on refugees:</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>The US also admitted that the pledges announced on Tuesday include any policy announced since the start of the year, and said that some of the pledges may not strictly fall within the previously stated goals of the summit. \u201cWe took a very broad interpretation,\u201d Ann Richard, the US\u2019s assistant secretary of state, said in an interview with the Guardian. </p> <p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t have to be a formal UNHCR resettlement programme, it could be other legal pathways for admission \u2013 scholarships, work visas or humanitarian visas.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>The pledges also include decisions by Turkey and Jordan in January to nominally open their labour markets to Syrians even though many Syrians in both countries are in reality still excluded from legal work.

On Monday, refugee advocates were left disappointed by the announcement of a non-binding declaration that upheld world leaders\u2019 pre-existing responsibilities for refugees, but offered little in terms of direct commitments.</p> <p>But the mood changed on Tuesday, with 18 developed countries announcing plans to increase legal access to refugees, 17 developing countries pledging to increase refugees\u2019 access to education, and 15 claiming that they would take various measures that could help to expand refugees\u2019 access to work.</p> <p>The western countries included those that are well-known for their generosity to refugees, including Germany and Sweden, as well as those, such as Australia, who are often criticised for their treatment of asylum seekers. Argentina and Portugal were among the countries who pledged to start resettlement programmes for the first time. Commenting on the relative success of his initiative, Obama said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to be honest: it\u2019s still not enough \u2013 not sufficient for a crisis of this magnitude.\u201d But he added: \u201cI hope this is a beginning.\u201d</p> <p>Leaders from the world\u2019s major refugee-hosting nations hailed the pledges, but warned that they meant little if they were not carried out.

Then they have a base from which to go. They have a welcome, rather than having refugees come in uninvited or illegally or alone.\u201d</p> <p>Australia launched a pilot of the program in 2013 and a similar initiative is being planned in the United Kingdom and New Zealand. Germany and Switzerland have both experimented with the idea while Spain and Japan are among the countries who have expressed interest in the program.</p> <p>Canada will now work with the UN High Commission for Refugees and Soros\u2019 Open Society Foundations to create training modules based on an analysis of the Canadian model as well as provide technical assistance to countries interested in adopting the program, said McCallum. </p> <p>Private sponsorship was launched in Canada after the Vietnam war and has since brought in more than 275,000 refugees, including nearly 9,000 Syrian refugees, in addition to those brought in by government programs. Studies suggest the support of private citizens facilitates the settlement process, with privately-sponsored refugees reporting more success and integration than their government-sponsored counterparts.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e16d41e4b05714d0da2b89\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-20T17:13:39.006Z\">6.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>An interesting spot on Twitter by the New York Times\u2019 UN correspondent <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SominiSengupta\">Somini Sengupta</a>: the Russian foreign ministry tweeted that, held up by US president Obama\u2019s motorcade, <strong>Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov got out and walked the rest of the way to the General Assembly</strong>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/mfa_russia/status/778242365962215424\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Manhattan traffic was blocked because of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BarackObama\">@BarackObama</a> motorcade. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Lavrov?src=hash\">#Lavrov</a> decided not to wait in traffic jam &amp; headed to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UN\">@UN</a> by walking <a href=\"https://t.co/L4XVBsvU1d\">pic.twitter.com/L4XVBsvU1d</a></p>&mdash; MFA Russia (@mfa_russia) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mfa_russia/status/778242365962215424\">September 20, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57e16a5ae4b05714d0da2b7b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-09-20T17:02:11.067Z\">6.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Hollande continues:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>No county can say that it is immune to the threat of Islamic terrorism, which has claimed lost individuals within our countries and radicalised them. </p> <p>No wall can stop ... this scourge.

          "bodyText": "UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon called yesterday\u2019s bombing of an aid convoy in Syria \u201csickening\u201d in his opening remarks to the General Assembly US president Barack Obama, in his last ever address to the assembly, said that America had been \u201ca force for good\u201d in the world In a special session on refugees, Obama pledged to take 110k refugees in 2017 In her maiden speech to the assembly, new British prime minister Theresa May announced that the UK would begin the proces of ratifying the Paris climate accords She also said that \u201cwhen the British people voted to leave the EU, they did not vote to turn inwards from our partners around the world.\u201d However, many criticised her speech for a distinction she made between economic migrants and refugees fleeing war In a powerful address, Abdullah II Ibn Al Hussein, King of Jordan, said that \u201cFalse perceptions of Muslims will fuel a global struggle by polarising factions east and west, driven deeper into hatred and intolerance.\u201d Prime minister Theresa May\u2019s inaugural speech at the UN General Assembly has not been met with universal acclaim. Rob Williams, CEO of War Child UK, said: We welcome the Prime Minister\u2019s strong commitment to eradicate modern slavery. Children fleeing conflict are particularly vulnerable to exploitation, sexual violence and recruitment into armed gangs, the worst violations against children. However a major driver of modern slavery within Europe is the relative absence of any safe and legal routes for displaced and refugee children to be reunited with their families in European countries. As a result, children end up at the mercy of criminal networks for merely trying to get to their loved ones. If the Prime Minister is serious about protecting the most vulnerable victims of modern slavery \u2013 children, we would urge her to support the establishment of safe and legal routes for children to be reunited with their families, and invest in cross-border child protection systems that can keep children safe. And Bill Frelick, writing in Newsweek in a column titled Theresa May\u2019s Refugee Vision is Narrow and Divisive, took issue with May\u2019s distinction between economic migrants and refugees, writing that: May\u2019s call for \u201cproperly applying\u201d the Refugee Convention appears to suggest that it should be used as a tool of exclusion, particularly for people caught up in the large-scale movements of refugees and migrants that the summit was intended to address. Africa and Latin America sought to fill the gap in the convention with regional declarations that included a wider refugee definition. The European Union\u2019s individualized asylum system has also managed to include wider grounds for protection beyond the limitations of the Refugee Convention. But advocates had hoped that the U.N. summit would close this protection gap globally. The opportunity was there for a universal declaration that there are many people in today\u2019s world, such as famine victims fleeing drought in Somalia and Salvadoran children fleeing gang violence, who face threats to their lives if they return home, whose claims for protection are as valid as political exiles and religious dissidents. You can read the full piece here. Security is tight for the General Assembly, as this tweet from the NYPD shows: Some more detailed analysis of May\u2019s speech earlier from Rowena Mason in New York. More than \u00a3100m of the UK aid budget will be spent on returning Somalian refugees to the country they fled and encouraging Eritreans not to cross the Mediterranean under plans outlined by Theresa May in New York. The prime minister used her maiden speech at the United Nations to expand on proposals aimed at stop \u201cmass uncontrolled population movement\u201d, which has seen refugees travelling long distances in search of better lives. Her plans attracted criticism earlier in the summit over the suggestion that those fleeing warzones should stay and claim asylum in the first safe country they reach, rather than seeking sanctuary in European nations such as Britain. However, May pressed on with the argument on Tuesday in an address to the general assembly, as she focused on actions in North Africa to stop migrants crossing the Mediterranean. In her speech, May said Britain would send more troops to Somalia to help train local troops to combat the al-Shabaab militant group, including up to 30 teams of between five and 30 personnel with no more than 70 in the country at any one time. \u201cThe UK is now going to increase further our security support and we will be calling on others to do the same, hosting an international conference on Somalia in 2017 to maintain this vital momentum,\u201d the prime minister said. While acknowledging Somalia is facing serious security problems, the government is also contributing \u00a320m from the aid budget to encourage refugees who fled the country to return home from the Dadaab camp in Kenya. \u201cWe will invest \u00a316m in Somalia to help do things around food, education, shelter and sustainable livelihoods and then \u00a34m to Kenya to help support the process of returning these people,\u201d a UK official said. The process has recently been criticised by the Human Rights Watch group, which said the return of the refugees from Somalia to Kenya cannot be considered voluntary as the Dadaab camp is at risk of being shut down. The UN has insisted there are no forced returns. At a later summit on refugees, hosted by US president Barack Obama, May said another \u00a380m from the aid budget will be aimed at helping migrants, largely Eritreans, stay in Ethiopia through the financial support for the construction of new industrial parks offering 100,000 new jobs, including 30,000 for refugees. This is an expansion of the programme used in Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon to try encourage refugees settle in the region rather than make journeys to European countries. Of the 124,000 refugees who crossed the Mediterranean to Italy between Jan 2016 and 12 Sept, 12% were Eritrean - second only to Nigeria who made up 20% of the numbers crossing. At the Obama summit, May also announced that more of the UK\u2019s aid budget would be spent on humanitarian efforts. A UK official said \u00a31.5bn for the year would be going towards refugees and others in dire need which is an extra 10% uplift from the aid budget. About \u00a32.5m will go to an international fund to help resettle refugees in other countries. However, May unveiled no new commitments for the UK to take in more than the 20,000 vulnerable Syrians who David Cameron agreed to accept by 2020, despite calls from charities and Labour for Britain to do more. Speaking ahead of the summit, May argued it was better to help a greater number of refugees at camps in countries bordering Syria than to resettle a smaller number in the UK. More from Patrick Kingsley from the leaders\u2019 summit on refugees: The US also admitted that the pledges announced on Tuesday include any policy announced since the start of the year, and said that some of the pledges may not strictly fall within the previously stated goals of the summit. \u201cWe took a very broad interpretation,\u201d Ann Richard, the US\u2019s assistant secretary of state, said in an interview with the Guardian. \u201cIt didn\u2019t have to be a formal UNHCR resettlement programme, it could be other legal pathways for admission \u2013 scholarships, work visas or humanitarian visas.\u201d The pledges also include decisions by Turkey and Jordan in January to nominally open their labour markets to Syrians even though many Syrians in both countries are in reality still excluded from legal work. According to US officials, other labour-related policies included those that simply allow refugees to live outside camps, or give them access to agricultural land. Refugee specialists who had criticised the vague UN-led declaration on Monday were nevertheless cautiously optimistic about Tuesday\u2019s US-led announcements. David Miliband, head of the International Rescue Committee, a major refugee agency, said: \u201cThe political inertia has finally been broken and now it needs to be turned into genuine momentum through effective implementation of each pledge,\u201d he added. \u201cPermit me to deviate from the written statement to address the Istraeli people,\u201d Sisi says, suddenly bringing his frantic reading delivery to a halt, then speaking much more slowly. We have a true opportunity, a real opportunity, to write a bright page in history; to move towards peace. The Egyptian experience is wonderful and unique and can be followed by establishing a Palestinian state, side by side with the Israeli state, that preserves safety and security for the Palestinians and safety and security for the Israelis, prosperity and peace for both. Abdel Fattah Al Sisi, president of Egypt, is now speaking. The world has become a global village as a result of the communications revolutions - however, we continue to see another facet of globalism, one that has produced a number of economic challenges. Globalism has been linked to a rise in poverty, the rise in the inequality gap ... perhaps these constitute the biggest reason for the international community to work diligently ... and meet the needs of their people. \u201cThe Egyptian people have succeeded in enforcing their will ... safeguarding society from sliding into anarchy,\u201d he says. A coalition of more than 30 countries unveiled a series of concrete responses to the refugee crisis on Tuesday, giving refugees a glimmer of hope in a week in which world leaders gathered at the UN summit in New York have otherwise failed to offer direct action on refugee issues, reports Patrick Kingsley from the UN leaders\u2019 summit on refugees. Barack Obama announced that the US-led coalition had collectively agreed to roughly double resettlement places for refugees, increase humanitarian aid for refugees by $4.5 billion, provide education to one million more refugee children, and potentially improve access to legal work for another million adults. Full details were not disclosed, but the move constituted the most concrete set of refugee measures at the annual UN summit. On Monday, refugee advocates were left disappointed by the announcement of a non-binding declaration that upheld world leaders\u2019 pre-existing responsibilities for refugees, but offered little in terms of direct commitments. But the mood changed on Tuesday, with 18 developed countries announcing plans to increase legal access to refugees, 17 developing countries pledging to increase refugees\u2019 access to education, and 15 claiming that they would take various measures that could help to expand refugees\u2019 access to work. The western countries included those that are well-known for their generosity to refugees, including Germany and Sweden, as well as those, such as Australia, who are often criticised for their treatment of asylum seekers. Argentina and Portugal were among the countries who pledged to start resettlement programmes for the first time. Commenting on the relative success of his initiative, Obama said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to be honest: it\u2019s still not enough \u2013 not sufficient for a crisis of this magnitude.\u201d But he added: \u201cI hope this is a beginning.\u201d Leaders from the world\u2019s major refugee-hosting nations hailed the pledges, but warned that they meant little if they were not carried out. Most pledges made at a similar summit in London in February have not been fulfilled. \u201cThe refugee crisis requires not just [pledged] commitment but follow-through,\u201d said King Abdullah of Jordan, a country that hosts more Syrian refugees than all the countries in the EU, which has a population that is 50 times bigger. David Miliband is at the refugees\u2019 summit: Over at the Leaders\u2019 Summit on Refugees, president Obama is taking the lead, upping the US\u2019s number of refugees it is pledged to take: More strikes against the Security Council, this time from South Africa\u2019s Jacob Zuma, who calls for its reform \u201cin order to ensure the representation of Africa\u201d. \u201cOne billion people cannot continue to be denied a voice in this manner,\u201d Zuma says, to applause from the chamber. The UN Leaders\u2019 Summit on refugees is about to begin. The Guardian\u2019s Patrick Kingsley is on the scene and will bring you more detail from the event as it unfolds, but politicians have squandered a chance to radically rethink the treaties and organisations that govern the world\u2019s handling of refugees, the director of Oxford University\u2019s Refugee Studies Centre told Kingsley earlier. Interviewed here in New York, Alexander Betts said that the refugee system needs to be rethought in the same way that the international monetary system was reworked in the 1970s. \u201cThe refugee regime was created in the 1950s for Europe and the early Cold War era,\u201d says Betts. \u201cYes it\u2019s been adapted incrementally but we\u2019ve never had a moment of systematic reflection.\u201d Betts adds: \u201cIn other areas like the international monetary system, when there was a big crisis as we saw in 1971, reform took place. 2016 should be the refugee system\u2019s 1971. It should involve reflection on our legal model, our organisational model, and our operational model \u2013 and that\u2019s what the political capital that we\u2019ve invested in these two days should have gone towards. But as it is, I think there are achievements, but I\u2019m not sure these achievements reach the level of ambition that the international community should have had in response to the refugee crisis. Poland joins the UK in announcing that it has begun the process of ratifying the Paris climate agreements, Duda says, invoking the new beginning of the so-called \u201canthropocene\u201d era. The afternoon plenary session is underway. Now speaking is Andrzej Duda, the president of Poland. Poland\u2019s ambassador to the UK has expressed concern about xenophobic attacks on Polish nationals which have begun occurring in Britain following the UK\u2019s vote to leave the European Union. It is not known whether Duda will address the issue in today\u2019s speech. \u201cWe will refuse to give into pressure to give in to pressures for easy votes\u201d Trudeau says. There is a choice to be made. Strong, diverse countires like Canada didn\u2019t happen by accident, and won\u2019t continue without effort. Every single day, we need to choose hope over fear, and diversity over division. Fear has never created a single job. Our citizens, the nearly 7.5 billion people we collectively serve, are better than the cynics and pessimists think they are. People want their problems solved, not exploited. \u201cCanada is a modest country. We know we can\u2019t solve these problems alone. We know it will be hard work. But we\u2019re Canadian, and we\u2019re here to help,\u201d he concludes. Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau is giving the final address of the morning session, switching between English and French. We need to create economic growth that is broadly shared, because a fair and successful world is a peaceful one. We need to focus on what brings us together, not on what divides us. In Canada, we see diversity as a source of strength. He says that in recent months Canadians \u201chave opened their arms and hearts\u201d to refugees fleeing the Syrian war, and \u201cwelcomed them as new Canadians\u201d. May also used her speech to give her first major commitment that Britain will continue to tackle climate change after leaving the EU, as she promised to ratify the Paris agreement by the end of the year. The UK remained determined to \u201cplay our part in the international effort against climate change \u2026 In a demonstration of our commitment to the agreement reached in Paris, the UK will start its domestic procedures to enable ratification of the Paris agreement and complete these before the end of the year,\u201d she said. The UK was party to negotiations as part of the EU and will be expected to take on emissions reductions based on an EU-wide \u201cburden-sharing\u201d agreement, which is yet to be worked out, reports Rowena Mason. May\u2019s decision to speed up ratification will relieve green campaigners and charities amid worries that the new prime minister could start retreating from Britain\u2019s position as a leader on tackling climate change after leaving the EU. She has rarely spoken about the subject in the past and was accused of a regressive step when she abolished the Department for Energy and Climate Change after taking office. However, pressure on the prime minister to agree to ratify the deal intensified after China and the US made a joint declaration that they would do so earlier in the month. A UK official said the prime minister\u2019s announcement was \u201cabsolutely a reflection of her commitment to delivering on that international agreement where the UK has been at the forefront of efforts\u201d. You can read the whole piece here. \u201cWhen the British people voted to leave the EU, they did not vote to turn inwards from our partners around the world,\u201d May says. \u201cThey demanded action ... but that action must be more global, not less.\u201d Only we ... can act to ensure this great institution is as relevant to our future as to our past. So let us come together ... and work together to build a better, safer, and more prosperous world for generations to come. \u201cWe should be clear that there is nothing wrong with going in search of a better life ... but countries must be able to exert control over their borders,\u201d May says. She says there are three fundamental principles that need to be established for migration. \u201cFirst, we must make sure that refugees claim asylum in the first safe country they reach,\u201d she says, adding that we should all do more to help those countries where refugees first arrive. Second, she says, a distinction must be made between economic migrants and those fleeing violence. And third, she reaffirms the declaration of human rights, saying that \u201cnearly 70 years on we are presented with a new form of slavery\u201d run by organised crime groups. \u201cTrafficked and sold across borders, victims are forced into the kind of existence which is almost beyond imagination. Victims are held captive in squalid conditions and forced into sex and labour.\u201d May talks now about fighting extremism; she mentions the UK-led resolution on aviation security, on which the UN will vote later. \u201cIt is not enough merely to focus on violent extremism; we must focus on ... hate and fear in all their forms,\u201d she continues. \u201cAcross the world today there are 65m people displaced,\u201d she says. \u201cThat is equivalent to the entire population of the United Kingdom.\u201d She calls for an end to the conflict in Syria. \u201cIt is a great honour for me to address this assembly for the first time,\u201d May starts. She says that the UN began to \u201cdeliver security across the globe.\u201d Some of the threats we face today are the same as those faced by the founders, she continues, but some are new - \u201cglobal warming, international terrorism, and mass movement of unprecedented number of people.\u201d \u201cAs a new prime minister of the UK, my message is simple: the UK will be a strong, dependable partner internationally. ... we will continue to honour our commitment to spend 0.7 percent of our GDP on development.\u201d She says that the UK will continue to be \u201ca steadfast member of the security council,\u201d and condemns the bombing of the aid convoy in Syria yesterday. She says, however, that those standing before the assembly must not forget that they serve their people at home, and that many have been left behind by globalization. \u201cWe need this, our United Nations, to forge a bold new multilateralism.\u201d It is the new prime minister\u2019s second outing on the international stage after attending the G20 summit in China earlier this month, reports Rowena Mason. She made a similar warning in Hangzhou about anti-globalisation sentiment, which has been linked to the rise of populist movements and leaders in many countries across the world, from Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in the US to the leftwing party Syriza in Greece. May\u2019s priority at both summits has also been to reassure world leaders that the UK is not turning away from the world because of the vote to leave the EU. She will meet the presidents of Turkey and Egypt on Tuesday morning before having her second meeting in a fortnight with the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe. Their discussion comes after Tokyo warned at the G20 that companies could withdraw from the UK without more clarity about access to the single market and other benefits of the EU after Brexit. On Monday night, May hosted a business reception at the consul general\u2019s residence in New York for US companies such as Goldman Sachs, Amazon, Black Rock, IBM and Morgan Stanley in a bid to convince them that Britain remains a good place to invest. May has attracted criticism at the summit for her proposals about refugees, after she suggested it was better to help those fleeing war in the first safe country they reach than to resettle them further away. She argued that the UN needed to help stop \u201cmass uncontrolled migration of people\u201d because it is dangerous, and asserted the right of countries to control their own borders. Speaking before the summit, the prime minister also challenged the arguments for taking in more refugees than the total to which the UK has already committed. Josaia Voreqe Bainimarama, the prime minister of Fiji, is talking about February\u2019s Cyclone Winston, as a harbinger of the ecological disaster that faces his island nation as global warming increases. \u201cIf this is what awaits us as global warming increases, then god help us,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are facing a nightmare scenario.\u201d Our message from the Pacific is this: the two degree cap is not enough. We want the world to go one better and embrace the 1.5 degree cap. ... but as a first step, I appeal to you all to ratify the Paris agreement, and turn our backs on the coalition of the selfish which would rather see the Pacific nations submerged than change their lifestyles. In a dramatic display of Latin America\u2019s political divisions, the delegations of Venezuela, Cuba, Bolivia, Ecuador and Nicaragua walked out during Brazilian President Michel Temer\u2019s speech at the U.N. General Assembly, according to the Associated Press. Venezuela\u2019s U.N. Ambassador Rafael Ramirez told the AP today that Temer is \u201can illegitimate president, the product of a coup d\u2019etat. We do not recognize him.\u201d Ecuadorean diplomat Carola Iniguez says her country\u2019s delegation walked out \u201cto protest the political situation in Brazil.\u201d Temer became Brazil\u2019s president following the ouster of Dilma Rousseff by the Senate over accusations of fiscal mismanagement. In his speech, Temer defended the impeachment process, insisting it was an example of democracy at work. He said: \u201cimpeaching a president is certainly not a trivial matter in a democratic regime. But there is no democracy without rule of law without rules applicable to all, including the most powerful. This is what Brazil is showing the world.\u201d Now Erdo\u011fan is calling for reform of the Security Council. \u201cWhat about the other countries around the world? We ignore them,\u201d he says. \u201cThe representative nature of the security council should be effective so that the security council could be more just and fair.\u201d Erdo\u011fan says that Turkey is now home to 2.7m refugees, and he hits out at countries who turn refugees away. \u201cThe rest of the world may not but we will keep on admitting them, because they are human being. We will keep our doors open, and we will keep our doors open in the future.\u201d The international community has failed its humanitarian values. It is notable that Erdo\u011fan is mentioning Kurdish separatist groups such as the PKK in the same lists as groups like Isis. This is a fraught topic; Turkey is an ally of the coalition against Isis, but so is Kurdistan, the autonomous northern region in Iraq that is home to the de facto Kurdish state - but Turkey is also home to a large number of Kurds, and the Turkish military has often engaged in fierce fighting with Kurdish separatists within south-eastern Turkey. \u201cWithin the first quarter of the 21st century, mankind has reached the peak in science, economy, development and health,\u201d Erdo\u011fan begins. \u201cHowever, this achievement conceals a dark face. In Syria, Iraq, and counties in the grip of terrorism around the world, hundreds of thousands of children, young, and elderly, are killed. Refugees running from oppression face derading treatment in many european cities.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s nigh time to show leadership with a sense of responsibility in addressing these problems in a determined fashion.\u201d Now he turns to the coup, which he describes as being orchestrated by a \u201cterrorist organisation\u201d. This coup attempt was successfully repelled by our nation, protected heroically her democracy, govt, freedoms, future and const order. That\u2019s why I take pride in my nation as my nation defeated this heinous coup attempt by risking their lives, and for a period of 29 days they never abandoned the squares around Turkey. They threw their bodies in front of the tanks. They showed a very noble stance. If I stand here today before you it is thanks to our nation\u2019s brave stance. Turkey\u2019s controversial president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan is due to speak next. His appearance comes just over a month after a failed coup attempt by a group of army officers against Erdo\u011fan\u2019s administration, which was brutally put down. One fraught issue that might come up is that of influential US-based cleric Fethullah Gulen. The Turkish president told Reuters in an interview on Monday that the United States should \u201cnot harbor a terrorist\u201d like Gulen and that his activities should be banned worldwide: Erdogan said Washington had \u201cno excuse\u201d for keeping Gulen, a former Erdogan ally who Turkish officials say has built up a network of followers over decades inside the armed forces and civil service to take over Turkey. \u201cIf the U.S. is our strategic ally and our NATO partner ... then they should not let a terrorist like Gulen run his organization,\u201d Erdogan said, in an interview on the sidelines of the annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations. Erdogan said an initial three months state of emergency, declared in the wake of the coup, could be extended if necessary. Critics say extending the state of emergency will give Erdogan a freer hand to limit or suspend freedoms, to bypass the parliament as well as taking swift measures against his opponents. \u201cOur generation is the first not to live through a world war,\u201d says Johann Schneider - Ammann, president of Switzerland. He contrasts technological achievements in solar power and combating climate change with the thousands of migrants dying in the Mediterranean as the best and the worst of this new world. \u201cWe have equipped ourselves with tools for building a better world,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is time for us to take up those tools.\u201d Abdullah II Ibn Al Hussein, King of Jordan, is giving a very powerful speech about the battle against extremism. \u201cI find myself stating the obvious again and again,\u201d he says. False perceptions of Muslims will fuel a global struggle by polarising factions east and west, driven deeper into hatred and intolerance. Muslims, a quarter of the world\u2019s population, citizens of every country, have a central role in the future of our planet. Muslim men and women brign a rich heritage of civic responsibility, justice, gen, family life, and a faith in god. When others exclude Muslims from fulfilling their role by prejudice or ignorance of what Islam is, or on the other hand when the outlaws of Islam ... attempt to mislead some Muslims by deforming our religion through false teachings, our society\u2019s future is put at risk. \u201cLadies and gentlemen, this is a battle that we must fight together,\u201d he adds. \u201cLet me state clearly that these radical groups do not exist on the fringes of Islam. They are altogether outside of it. They declare the civilized world as the enemy.\u201d He calls for an end to violence in Syria, led by a global coalition. Theresa May is set to be the penultimate speaker in the morning session of the General Assembly, and all eyes will be on the new prime minister as she faces the United Nations for the first time since the UK voted to leave the European Union in June. She will use her maiden speech at the United Nations to warn that it must work hard to remain relevant as too many people feel left behind by globalisation, reports Rowena Mason in New York. Speaking at the general assembly on Tuesday, she will draw attention to the British people\u2019s decision to vote to leave the EU, arguing that they want a \u201cpolitics that is more in touch with their concerns, and bold action to address them\u201d. The prime minister will argue that there is still a crucial role for international bodies such as the UN, even as people are wary of globalisation, but she will warn that it must modernise to meet the challenges of mass migration, modern slavery and terrorism. \u201cWe must recognise that for too many of those men and women, the increasing pace of globalisation has left them feeling left behind,\u201d she will say. \u201cThe challenge for those of us in this room is to ensure our governments and our global institutions, such as this United Nations, remain responsive to the people that we serve. That we are capable of adapting our institutions to the demands of the 21st century.\u201d You can read the whole piece here. Canada\u2019s prime minister Justin Trudeau is set to close out the morning session of the General Assembly, speaking immediately after Theresa May, according to the schedule. In the meantime, the Canadian government, with the United Nations and billionaire George Soros, is launching an initiative to help other countries implement a program that has allowed private citizens to bring hundreds of thousands of refugees to Canada in the past 35 years, reports Ashifa Kassam from Toronto. The country\u2019s private sponsorship program, as it is known, enables groups of Canadians to settle refugees in exchange for a commitment to cover their expenses and provide help to the newcomers as they adjust to their new home. Some 13 countries \u2013 including the United Kingdom -- have expressed interest in implementing their own version of the program, John McCallum, Canada\u2019s minister for immigration, refugees and citizenship said on Tuesday. \u201cEvery country\u2019s circumstances are different but we believe this is a good model which is exportable to other countries,\u201d he told reporters in New York City. \u201cYou are miles ahead if you can bring refugees in supported by our own citizens. Then they have a base from which to go. They have a welcome, rather than having refugees come in uninvited or illegally or alone.\u201d Australia launched a pilot of the program in 2013 and a similar initiative is being planned in the United Kingdom and New Zealand. Germany and Switzerland have both experimented with the idea while Spain and Japan are among the countries who have expressed interest in the program. Canada will now work with the UN High Commission for Refugees and Soros\u2019 Open Society Foundations to create training modules based on an analysis of the Canadian model as well as provide technical assistance to countries interested in adopting the program, said McCallum. Private sponsorship was launched in Canada after the Vietnam war and has since brought in more than 275,000 refugees, including nearly 9,000 Syrian refugees, in addition to those brought in by government programs. Studies suggest the support of private citizens facilitates the settlement process, with privately-sponsored refugees reporting more success and integration than their government-sponsored counterparts. An interesting spot on Twitter by the New York Times\u2019 UN correspondent Somini Sengupta: the Russian foreign ministry tweeted that, held up by US president Obama\u2019s motorcade, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov got out and walked the rest of the way to the General Assembly. Hollande continues: No county can say that it is immune to the threat of Islamic terrorism, which has claimed lost individuals within our countries and radicalised them. No wall can stop ... this scourge. Terrorism prospers from open conflicts that have for too long not been solved. Its brought a wave of refugees. It\u2019s shaken the established order. ... the collective security that was the very principles of the UN. In the face of these dangers, France once again turns to the United Nations. If we want to eradicate terrorism, if we want to act, then we need to take decisons. We can\u2019t just talk about solidarity, we can\u2019t just show passion. We need to take action. He says that He is calling for a \u201c2020 agenda for Africa\u201d to bring electricity to all Africans to encourage sustainable growth and development, and reducing migration which, he says, produces instability in the countries to which the migrants go. Then he moves on to Syria. The Syrian tragedy will be seen as a disgrace to the international community if we do no tend it soon. Aleppo is a martyrd city. Thousands have died in bombing. Humanitarian convoys have been attacked. Chemical weapons have been used. I have one thing to say here: this is enough.\u201d The international community must compel the regime to peace, he says, or they will be complicit in the tragedy. France has four requests, he says. First, impose the ceasefire. Then ensure the immediate sending of aid to Aleppo. Then ensure that political negotiations resume; and finally punish the use of chemical weapons. \u201cThat is an issue of justice,\u201d Hollande says. Nicky Woolf here, taking over from my colleague Haroon Siddique. Prime Minister Theresa May is expected to speak later today. Currently, Argentinian president Mauricio Macri is addressing the chamber. He calls the refugee crisis a \u201cmajor challenge\u201d. \u201cThough a year ago we made a commitment to not leave anybody behind, today the images we see pain us,\u201d Macri says. \u201cReality calls for us to do more.\u201d He pledges that Argentina will ramp up the number of Syrian refugees it will take. After that speech, in which he urged wealthy nations to do more to help refugees, Obama will be hosting a summit in New York dedicated to that very subject, where he hopes other countries will pledge more help. He stressed throughout his speech that it was only through co-operation that the world\u2019s greatest challenges could be addressed, whether climate change, ending conflict or addressing the refugee crisis. In tandem he warned of the dangers of nationalism, intolerance and isolationism. Obama also made it a robust defence of his record in office and that of the US generally, describing it as a rare superpower that has been prepared to work not only in its own interests. Not everyone will agree with that analysis but his references to the dangers of building walls may well have been intended as a warning of how he things might change if he is succeeded in the Oval Office by Donald Trump. Obama says the US has been a \u201cforce for good\u201d, a rare superpower in human history that has been able to think beyond narrow self interests. He refers to more threats, nuclear proliferation, the Zika virus. Obama says it is worth giving up some freedom of action to bind countries to international rules. He says a peaceful resolution to the disputes in the South China Sea is far greater than \u201carguing over rocks and reefs\u201d.Russia\u2019s nationalism and interference in the affairs of its neighbours will \u201cdiminish its stature and make its borders less secure\u201d. We have to open our hearts and do more to help refugees who are desperate for a home ...We have to do more, even when the politics are hard. Obama says there is \u201ca much darker and more cynical version of history we can adopt\u201d. Each of us has leaders, as nations, can choose to reject those who appeal to our worst impulses and choose those who appeal to our best impulses. We have shown that we can choose a better history. He says his own family is made up of cultures, flesh and faith from different parts of the world just as America is built from immigration from different shores. I believe I can best serve my own people, I can best look after my daughters, by actively seeking what is best for all people ...All of us can be co-workers with God. And that is the end of Obama\u2019s last address to the UN general assembly as president. Obama says: We must reject any forms of fundamentalism, or racism or a belief in ethnic superiority that makes our differences irreconcilable with modernity. He talks about protests against cartoons of the prophet Muhammad, then he takes direct aim at Vladimir Putin. We see Russia trying to capture lost glory through force The world is too small for us to be able to resort to \u201cold ways of thinking\u201d, says Obama. We have seen this in the Middle East where leaders persecuted political opposition or minorities/sects. He says they have helped fuel the growth of Isis. Our international community must seek to work with those who seek to build, rather than destroy. On Syria, Obama says we must provide aid to those in need and engage in \u201chard diplomacy\u201d. There is no ultimate military victory to be won. He calls for progress on Israel-Palestine, saying Palestinians must reject incitement and Israel must realise it cannot criminally occupy Palestinian land. For the small fraction of what we spent on war in Iraq we could invest money in fragile states to ensure they don\u2019t collapse in the first places, says Obama. That\u2019s why we must act on climate change and help the poorest countries \u201cleap-frog\u201d damaging sources of energy. We need new models of the global marketplace, models that are inclusive and sustainable. There is a growing conflict between libertarianism and authoritarianism, says Obama. He stresses he is not saying that the US model is the only right model but says that he will always come down on the side of libertarianism against authoritarianism. I believe the road of true democracy remains the better path. In Europe the progress of the eastern-bloc countries who embraced democracy have progressed much faster than those who didn\u2019t, says Obama. He rejects the idea that what happened in Ukraine was the result of a foreign plot but says it happened because of what Ukrainian citizens saw happening around them. Those of us who believe in democracy need to speak out forcefully because the facts and history are on our side. The answer is not a rejection of global integration but working together so that the benefits of integration are broadly shared, says Obama. The cultural impacts of integration must be squarely addressed. It starts by making the global economy work better and not just for those at the top. Often those who have benefited the most from globalisation have often used their powers to undermine workers, says Obama. He refers to $8tn stashed away in tax havens. A world in which 1% own as much as wealth as the other 99% will never be stable. The US president says trade wars, market subsidies, an over-reliance on natural resources rather than innovation will make us poor. We do not have to submit to \u201ca soulless capitalism that benefits only the few\u201d. The rights of workers must be respected, people should be invested in and there should be a strengthening of the safety net. Obama says he has pursued these policies in the US with \u201cclear results\u201d. Last year, poverty in this country fell at the fastest rate in nearly 50 years. It is not about punishing wealth but curbing the excesses of capitalism, says Obama. By many measures the world is safer and more prosperous than ever before says Obama, and yet there is much strife. We must recognise that the same forces of globalisation that have pulled us together have also exposed deep fault lines. We must go forward and not backward. As imperfect as they are the principles of open markets, human rights, democracy are vital. The integration of our global economy as made things better for billions of people. It means children have enough to eat, mothers don\u2019t die in childbirth. A person born today is more like to be healthy, live longer and have access to opportunity than at any time in history, says Obama Despite the areas where \u201cfreedom remains in retreat\u201d the number of democracies has increased. Social media has given people more ways to express themselves and hold leaders to account, the US president continues. He condemns nationalism, also crude populism - sometimes from the far left but mostly from the right - and tribalism. Here is Barack Obama, to applause. He begins by recounting progress over the past eight years: a response to the global economic crisis taking away terrorist safe havens resolving the Iran nuclear issue He also refers to progress in Colombia and Myanmar. Obama highlights the framework to protect the world from climate change. This is important work that has made a real difference to the lives of our people. It could not have happened without us working together. And yet, he goes on, there is the global refugee crisis, a break down of \u201cbasic order\u201d in the middle east, too many governments muzzling critics. This is the paradox that defines our world today. Another important segment from Ban Ki-Moon\u2019s final address to the UN general assembly was the regret he expressed over sexual abuse by UN peacekeepers in Central African Republic and an outbreak of cholera in Haiti. He said that these two matters had \u201ctarnished the reputation of the United Nations and, far worse, traumatised many people we serve.\u201d The United Nations has promised to crack down on abuses after dozens of accusations of sexual abuse and exploitation by peacekeepers in Central African Republic, where UN troops assumed authority from African Union troops in September 2014. Ban said: The despicable acts of sexual exploitation and abuse committed by a number of U.N. peacekeepers and other personnel have compounded the suffering of people already caught up in armed conflict, and undermined the work done by so many others around the world. Protectors must never become predators. In Haiti, Ban is working on a new response to an outbreak of cholera. The country was free of cholera until 2010, when UN peacekeepers dumped infected sewage into a river. Ban said: I feel tremendous regret and sorrow at the profound suffering of Haitians affected by cholera. Let us work together to meet our obligations to the Haitian people. He called it the \u201cmoral responsibility\u201d of the UN to do so. A 2011 study by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said U.N. peacekeepers from Nepal, where cholera is endemic, were the likely cause of the outbreak. Since then, more than 9,000 people have died of the disease that causes uncontrollable diarrhea and 800,000 people have fallen ill, mostly in the first two years of the outbreak. And here he is: Here is the fashionably late president: The United Nations and Arab League envoy to Syria, Staffan de Mistura, has echoed John Kerry in saying the ceasefire is not dead but warned that it is \u201cin danger\u201d. And here are Julian\u2019s thoughts: Apparently, Barack Obama is still on his way so the speaker who was due to be after the US president is going to swap places with him and is at the podium now. It\u2019s the president of Chad, Idriss D\u00e9by. Julian has more from the Syria meeting, this time from the UK foreign secretary: Reuters reports that the French foreign minister Jean-Marc Ayrault, said that today\u2019s meeting was dramatic and that he\u2019s not about to say the ceasefire will be saved. He proposed a wider mechanism to monitor the ceasefire, saying it could not just be a US-Russian effort. More news on Syria from the support group meeting. Despite recent events, members are not yet prepared to say the ceasefire has failed: Meanwhile, as the International Syria Support Group, whose members include the US and Russia meet, Russia claims that there was no attack on a UN aid convoy yesterday but that it \u201ccaught fire\u201d. From Reuters: The Russian Defence Ministry on Tuesday rejected assertions that an aid convoy near Aleppo had been shelled or struck from the air, saying it believed it had caught fire instead, the Interfax news agency cited spokesman Igor Konashenkov as saying. It quoted Konashenkov, commenting on the incident which occurred on Monday, as saying that only the White Helmets civil defence rescue group could answer who was responsible and why. Konashenkov was cited as saying that the White Helmets were close to the militant group formerly known as the Nusra Front. The Syrian government has also denied responsibility. About 20 people were killed according to the International Committee of the Red Cross. The US has said Russia must bear responsibility for the attack on the convoy, regardless of whether Russian planes were involved. I did say Bocelli would be a hard act to follow. Ban suggests that the UN president and his successor should look into ways to improve decision making. He refers to countries exercising vetoes and \u201cholding the world to hostage on so many important issues\u201d. There have been a number of vetoes on Syria, by Russia and China. Ban says that when he came to office a smartphone was not available but now it is a \u201clifeline\u201d for many people. Despite being misused by extremists smartphones they can be of great value in making the world a better place, he says. Our phones and social media have connected the world. Ban concludes. My colleague Julian Borger questions Ban\u2019s claim about appointing more women than ever before to senior problems: Ban says he has appointed more women to senior positions than ever before. To applause he says: I\u2019m proud to call myself a feminist. Women hold up half the sky. More must be done to tackle chronic violence against women and improve their participation in decision-making. He is talking about a range of achievements, including in-roads against the death penalty, the international criminal court. Ban urges those present to say \u201cNo\u201d to cracking down against freedom of assembly and expression. One would imagine Turkey is on the list of countries he is thinking of. Here is the quote that could be seen as criticism of Donald Trump, as well as other right wing politicians: Ban calls on all with influence to end the fighting. The future of Syria should not rest on the fate of a single man. He says the prospects of a two-state solution in Israel/Palestine diminish by the day. Ban also cites problems in North Korea, Ukraine, South Sudan, and urges leaders to serve their people and not pilfer resources. In comments that seem aimed at Donald Trump, he refers to the demonisation of Muslims that he says has haunting echoes of the past, urging politicians to be wary of hateful rhetoric. Ban also cites places where he says prospects are more positive, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Colombia and Cyprus. Ban says he stands before the assembly with \u201cdeep concern\u201d despite many achievements since he entered office eight years ago. He refers to \u201cgulfs\u201d between leaders and their citizens and the danger posed by extremists and climate change. Nevertheless he remains optimistic that the gap between rich and poor can be bridged. He urges leaders to bring the Paris agreement on climate change into effect before the end of the year. There are \u201cgreat security threats\u201d, he says, citing radicalisation. The consequences are on display from Yemen to Syria. On Syria, he says \u201cpowerful patrons\u201d of both sides in the conflict \u201chave blood on their hands\u201d. Present in this hall today are representatives of governments that have ignored, facilitated, funded, participated in or even planned and carried out atrocities inflicted by all sides of the Syria conflict against Syrian civilians. Many groups have killed innocent civilians, none more so than the government of Syria.\u201d He calls yesterday\u2019s attack on a UN aid convoy sickening. The general debate is about to begin. Before that, opera singer Andrea Bocelli serenaded heads of state with a rousing version of Nessun Dorma. It\u2019s a hard act for Ban Ki-moon to follow. My colleague Julian Borger is at the hotel where the meeting of the International Syria Support Group is taking place. There is a lot for its members to discuss. Reuters quotes the German foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, as saying they must see if there is a way back to a truce in Syria or if \u201cthis has already become hopeless\u201d. Interested in the types of seats the heads of state will be sitting on? The UN thinks you are: And if that\u2019s not exciting enough for you: Theresa May\u2019s plan to keep refugees to the first country they reach after fleeing their homes is unrealistic, the head of the UN\u2019s migration agency has told the Guardian. Comparing the UK prime minister\u2019s idea to the EU\u2019s failed Dublin scheme, which is nominally meant to keep refugees inside the first European countries they reach, William Lacy Swing, head of the International Organisation for Migration, said it was impractical to expect a similar plan to work better across a far wider area. During an interview on the sidelines of the UN general assembly in New York, he said: I\u2019ve felt for a long time that Dublin is not being honoured or respected. I think that migrants and refugees should be able to go to where they need to go to get work and protection. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something that is likely to be extendable [beyond the borders of Europe]. Countries like Germany and Sweden have largely failed to send people back to the countries in which they entered Europe partly because of the logistical impracticalities of moving so many people and also due to the failing infrastructures of countries like Greece. The International Syria Support Group, encompassing the foreign secretaries of international powers with interests in Syria, is taking place now. The meeting comes amid a collapse of the short-lived ceasefire and tensions between the US and Russia over who is to blame for the ending of the truce, as well as the attack on the aid convoy outside Aleppo on Monday. This is the scene in New York: Today\u2019s the second and final day of the refugee-focussed parts of the summit. After the disappointment of yesterday\u2019s UN-led meeting, in which leaders agreed to a generic and non-binding statement on refugees that delayed collective action until 2018, around 45 countries are expected to make more concrete pledges on an individual basis at a US-led gathering today. Negotiations are going down to the wire, and yesterday US officials wouldn\u2019t tell me exactly what is expected from who but they did feel hopeful that they will more or less meet their target of a) increasing humanitarian aid by 30%, b) doubling resettlement places, and c) letting one million more refugees into the labour market, and another million refugee children into education. \u201c\u2019We\u2019re confident that we\u2019re going to accomplish all this in terms of pledges,\u201d Assistant Secretary of State Ann Richard said. But Richard also admitted that they have included within this calculation anything that has already been pledged since the start of the year, and said that some of the pledges may not strictly fall within the goals of the summit. She said: We took a very broad interpretation. It didn\u2019t have to be a formal UNHCR resettlement programme, it could be other legal pathways for admission \u2013 scholarships, work visas or humanitarian visas. Implementation is also a concern, said Richard. For me the much harder piece is follow-up. The countries that make commitments \u2013 do they mean it, and will they follow through? Usually an administration would spend the next year making sure these countries follow up \u2013 but the Obama administration is going to leave office at the end of January. Separately, various business leaders are expected to announce initiatives to help refugees. George Soros has already announced a $500 million fund for refugee-focussed enterprises. Russian and Syrian air forces were not involved in air strikes on a humanitarian aid convoy near Aleppo in Syria on Monday, Russia\u2019s defence ministry said on Tuesday. In comments read on Russian state-run Rossiya 24 television channel, spokesman Igor Konashenkov said: All information on the whereabouts of the convoy was available only to the militants controlling these areas. The US has said Russia must bear responsibility for the air strike, whether or not Russian planes were involved because it was responsible under the ceasefire agreement for reining in Bashar al-Assad\u2019s government forces. The convoy was hit while unloading food at a warehouse in opposition-controlled Urem al-Kubra. The International Committee of the Red Cross says around 20 civilians were killed, including a member of the Syrian Red Crescent. The 71st session of the UN general assembly has the theme of \u201cThe Sustainable Development Goals: a universal push to transform our world\u201d but the general debate takes place today amid familiar rancour between the US and Russia: A meeting of the Syria support group is due to take place (at 8.30am US eastern time) amid a collapse of the ceasefire and after an airstrike struck an aid convoy. There could be a tense meeting between John Kerry and his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov, if the latter shows up. The US has pinned blame for the collapse of the ceasefire on Russia and also said it must bear responsibility for the attack on the convoy, regardless of whether Russian planes were involved. Barack Obama\u2019s final address to the assembled international leaders is the most anticipated event of the general assembly. Aides have said he plans to summarise his diplomatic accomplishments and champion the value of international institutions such as the U.N. in helping address global crises, pointing to agreements on climate change and on sanctions against Iran and North Korea. He is also determined to press for more action to address the global refugee crisis. Proceedings are scheduled to start at 9am ET with an address by secretary general Ban Ki-moon. Obama is on third after Ban and Brazilian president Michel Temer, who is making his first address as president after Dilma Rousseff was removed from office amid a bribery scandal. Obama is also hosting a summit on how to respond to the global refugee crisis in New York today. For leaders to speak at the summit, they will have to make substantial new pledges to either take in more refugees, do more to help those who have already arrived or give much greater assistance to host countries in the developing world, where 86% of the world\u2019s refugees live. The UK prime minister, Theresa May, will use her maiden speech at the UN to warn that it must work hard to remain relevant as too many people feel left behind by globalisation. She will draw attention to the British people\u2019s decision to vote to leave the EU, while stressing that it does not mean it is turning away from the world. The French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande is also addressing the assembly this morning and is expected to address the future of Europe as well as foreign policy concerns. The country has suffered three major terrorist attacks in 18 months. Hollande will speak amid polls showing he is the least popular French president on record, largely because of the economy.",

          "bodyText": "The disconnect was disconcerting. A parallel universe where the space-time continuum was ruptured. Tim Farron bounced on to the stage and looked the Lib Dem conference in the eye. \u201cBelieve,\u201d he implored them. Believe that the Liberal Democrats will be the country\u2019s strong opposition. Believe that the Liberal Democrats are the only party standing between 20 years of Conservative government and a near-fatal exit from the European Union. And just for the duration of the speech, the Lib Dem loyalists really did their best to believe. They stood up to applaud, they laughed at his crap gags and they gave him a rousing sendoff at the end. And then reality kicked in. They only have eight MPs and their popularity ratings have flatlined at 6% throughout the last year. But Farron is an optimist. A Lib Dem leader can\u2019t be anything but. Especially now. After the party\u2019s brief scent of power ended in last year\u2019s electoral wipeout, it\u2019s a tough gig having to go back to square one and convince people you are a serious proposition all over again. Farron did give it a good go, though. He called out Theresa May for having done even less to campaign for a remain vote than Jeremy Corbyn. He made an unashamed land-grab for any unhappy Labour moderates by praising Tony Blair\u2019s legacy. That\u2019s not something you\u2019re likely to hear at either the Labour or Conservative conferences. But beggars can\u2019t be choosers. Not so much a third way as a fourth way. Think Tony without the Iraq war. Cuddly, early years Tony. \u201cI\u2019m not a Blairite,\u201d Farron insisted, though he might have had his fingers crossed because he looked quite misty-eyed. He had even tried to pick up some of Tony\u2019s trademark mannerisms. The hand gestures. The \u201clove me\u201d eye contact. The pauses. The catch in the throat. The ersatz emotion. But he just didn\u2019t have very much to back any of it up. He had the soundbites, he just didn\u2019t have the conviction. He promised \u201canother referendum\u201d though he was careful not to call it a second referendum as that would sound as if he was just having a sulk at not getting the result he wanted in the first one. Another referendum was just giving everyone the opportunity to have another think about their decision once they had had enough time to realise what a hideous mistake they had made. How he was going to enforce this \u201canother referendum\u201d was anyone\u2019s guess. Farron doesn\u2019t even have his own party\u2019s support for that. Only hours after it had become Lib Dem policy the day before, one of his MPs, Norman Lamb, openly said it was a terrible idea. But Farron was sure he was on the road to victory. If he couldn\u2019t do a Justin Trudeau, then at least he would win at least a few more council seats.

          "body": "<h2><strong>The fraught future of Europe</strong><br></h2> <p>Your headline coverage of the hardening of attitudes to refugees and the corresponding rise of the far right in Europe made gloomy reading for me <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/01/alan-kurdi-death-one-year-on-compassion-towards-refugees-fades\" title=\"\">(9 September)</a>. All the more so because it reflects a similar hardening of attitudes towards refugees evident here in Australia.</p> <p>On a recent flight from Dubai to Adelaide my wife Julie and I encountered Syrian refugees bound for re-settlement in South Australia. They were in a state of anxious anticipation at the prospect of new life down under. But, much more than this, they were relieved to be escaping the holocaust in their homeland.</p> <p>I hope that promise of a new life is fulfilled. The odds are very much with them that it will. But it won\u2019t be completely plain sailing for them here in terms of acceptance by any means.</p> <p>They are starting out on a new life in a nervous society where buses for the first time ask passengers to be wary of unattended luggage, where government warnings encourage us to report anything that \u201cdoesn\u2019t look right\u201d, where an innocent question from a Syrian refugee to a policeman can be enough for that refugee to have his details written down as a routine security precaution, where our cyberspace is full of the most puerile anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant nonsense, where far rightists on immigration have just had marked success in our recent national election, and where a barbaric refugee policy still has strong public support.</p> <p>Let\u2019s hope we can buck our own version of the far-rightist trend you identify for Europe. At present it could go either way.<br><strong>Terry Hewton</strong><br>Adelaide, South Australia</p> <p>\u2022 Natalie Nougayr\u00e8de comments on the future of Europe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/02/angela-merkel-marine-le-pen-europe-destiny\" title=\"\">(9 September)</a>, with her opinion that behind all evil in the world is Russia. I totally agree that \u201cthe so-called Franco-German engine ... is broken \u2013 mainly because of France\u2019s economic weaknesses\u201d. Germany, for all its talk of upholding the rules, breaks year after year the rules on trade surpluses. It is projected to reach this year alone up to 8.9% of GDP. Anything above 6% is in violation of EU rules.</p> <p>Where are the politicians and journalists to shine the brightest light on this destruction of other nations\u2019 economies? Is it a wonder that the French voters turn to the Front National if, on their backs, Germany exports its unemployment? A reduced import deficit from Germany would allow for breathing space for the other European nations.<br><strong>Steffen M\u00fcller</strong><br>Hastings, UK</p> <p>\u2022 In The currency of community <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/22/the-euro-and-its-threat-to-the-future-of-europe-joseph-stiglitz-review\" title=\"\">(9&#xa0;September)</a>, his review of Joseph Stiglitz\u2019s book on the failings of the euro, John Kampfner makes the point that the present crisis in Europe embraces far more than a currency imbalance. Like it or not, the Brexit decision pinpoints wide disillusionment in the UK with the apparent evolution of the EU into an unwitting instrument of the uneven distribution of power and wealth.</p> <p>The imminent withdrawal of Britain may have an even greater impact on the EU. It must contribute to the growing dissent among EU members suffering the dual impacts of austerity and the influx of refugees.</p> <p>That the European experiment is still worth pursuing goes without saying. In our current geopolitical context, even major economies such as Germany stand little chance on their own of competing with the superpowers, China and America. It is ironic that the success of this attempt to create unity from recent disharmony now rests on whether Germany, under Angela Merkel, maintains effective leadership, or whether the various rightwing groups typified by Marine Le Pen gain effective control.</p> <p>Should the rightwing movements gain power, the future for a united Europe looks bleak indeed. If this, the worst possible outcome eventuates, Britain may well enjoy a short period of self-congratulation for seeing the writing on the wall.<br><strong>Noel Bird</strong><br>Boreen Point, Queensland, Australia</p> <h2><strong>Censorship by Facebook</strong><br></h2> <p>I read with interest the Norwegian prime minister, Erna Solberg, commenting on the recent furore over Facebook\u2019s censoring of the iconic image taken during the American war in Vietnam <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/09/facebook-deletes-norway-pms-post-napalm-girl-post-row\" title=\"\">(16 September)</a>. The horrific image depicts Kim Ph\u00fac, as a young girl, running down a road near Trang Bang, her naked body spattered with burning napalm.</p> <p>Solberg states, \u201cI want my children, and other children around the world, to grow up in a society where history is told as it was. In a society where they can grow into mature adults by learning from experiences of past generations, to be better informed citizens of the world.\u201d</p> <p>I could not agree more. War is not only cruel because of the people that perpetrate violence. It is also cruel because of the people who fuel it. When I see this picture I see napalm. When I think napalm, I think of the Norwegian government permitting Norway to be one of the biggest suppliers of magnesium to the US production of napalm in the 50s.</p> <p>Cut to the present day. Norway is still a major-league global supplier of weapons (per capita). The Norwegian female ski-jumping team and Norwegian biathletes are sponsored by the Norwegian-US arms producer Nammo.</p> <p>Nobody is learning anything. Erna Solberg is just telling it as it is. <br><strong>Patji Aln\u00e6s-Katjavivi</strong><br>Oslo, Norway</p> <h2><strong>Rise of the Anthropocene</strong><br></h2> <p>The Anthropocene, according to ecologist James Lovelock, can be traced back to 1712 when the first steam engine began operation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/29/declare-anthropocene-epoch-experts-urge-geological-congress-human-impact-earth\" title=\"\">(9&#xa0;September)</a>. Later, of course, we became even more inventive and began ransacking the energy stored in the Earth.</p> <p>The Industrial Revolution\u2019s carbon emissions and the \u201cplastic pollution\u201d that has now spilled over into our oceans, are just two of the major, and not entirely foreseen, consequences. But the most serious development that defines our epoch according to Lovelock, in his latest book A Rough Ride to the Future, is overpopulation. \u201cGaia, the Earth System,\u201d he says, \u201ccannot sustain the present level of human population for very much longer.\u201d<br><strong>Richard Orlando</strong><br>Westmount, Quebec, Canada</p> <h2><strong>Mindful of mindfulness</strong><br></h2> <p>Terry Eagleton, in his review of The Happiness Industry <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/03/the-happiness-industry-by-william-davies-review\" title=\"\">(26 August)</a>, does the notion of mindfulness an injustice. At the recent Mind and Life Conference with the Dalai Lama in Brussels on Power and Care, we were reminded that the pursuit of happiness involves also doing our best to reduce suffering in the world. Training in mindfulness can help some to break out of the bonds of powerlessness and feel their own strength to become better advocates for global justice.</p> <p>As temporary residents on this planet, we have the power and the responsibility to care enough to be, to the best of our ability, active in making a positive difference for the benefit of all creatures today and tomorrow.<br><strong>Silvia Dingwall</strong><br>Nussbaumen, Switzerland</p> <h2><strong>Briefly</strong><br></h2> <p>\u2022 I can fully sympathise with Anthony Walter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/aug/30/guardian-weekly-letters-australia-detention-nauru\" title=\"\">(Briefly, 2 September)</a> and his difficulty with mystifying terms used in the Weekly.

          "bodyText": "The fraught future of Europe Your headline coverage of the hardening of attitudes to refugees and the corresponding rise of the far right in Europe made gloomy reading for me (9 September). All the more so because it reflects a similar hardening of attitudes towards refugees evident here in Australia. On a recent flight from Dubai to Adelaide my wife Julie and I encountered Syrian refugees bound for re-settlement in South Australia. They were in a state of anxious anticipation at the prospect of new life down under. But, much more than this, they were relieved to be escaping the holocaust in their homeland. I hope that promise of a new life is fulfilled. The odds are very much with them that it will. But it won\u2019t be completely plain sailing for them here in terms of acceptance by any means. They are starting out on a new life in a nervous society where buses for the first time ask passengers to be wary of unattended luggage, where government warnings encourage us to report anything that \u201cdoesn\u2019t look right\u201d, where an innocent question from a Syrian refugee to a policeman can be enough for that refugee to have his details written down as a routine security precaution, where our cyberspace is full of the most puerile anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant nonsense, where far rightists on immigration have just had marked success in our recent national election, and where a barbaric refugee policy still has strong public support. Let\u2019s hope we can buck our own version of the far-rightist trend you identify for Europe. At present it could go either way. Terry Hewton Adelaide, South Australia \u2022 Natalie Nougayr\u00e8de comments on the future of Europe (9 September), with her opinion that behind all evil in the world is Russia. I totally agree that \u201cthe so-called Franco-German engine ... is broken \u2013 mainly because of France\u2019s economic weaknesses\u201d. Germany, for all its talk of upholding the rules, breaks year after year the rules on trade surpluses. It is projected to reach this year alone up to 8.9% of GDP. Anything above 6% is in violation of EU rules. Where are the politicians and journalists to shine the brightest light on this destruction of other nations\u2019 economies? Is it a wonder that the French voters turn to the Front National if, on their backs, Germany exports its unemployment? A reduced import deficit from Germany would allow for breathing space for the other European nations. Steffen M\u00fcller Hastings, UK \u2022 In The currency of community (9 September), his review of Joseph Stiglitz\u2019s book on the failings of the euro, John Kampfner makes the point that the present crisis in Europe embraces far more than a currency imbalance. Like it or not, the Brexit decision pinpoints wide disillusionment in the UK with the apparent evolution of the EU into an unwitting instrument of the uneven distribution of power and wealth. The imminent withdrawal of Britain may have an even greater impact on the EU. It must contribute to the growing dissent among EU members suffering the dual impacts of austerity and the influx of refugees. That the European experiment is still worth pursuing goes without saying. In our current geopolitical context, even major economies such as Germany stand little chance on their own of competing with the superpowers, China and America. It is ironic that the success of this attempt to create unity from recent disharmony now rests on whether Germany, under Angela Merkel, maintains effective leadership, or whether the various rightwing groups typified by Marine Le Pen gain effective control. Should the rightwing movements gain power, the future for a united Europe looks bleak indeed. If this, the worst possible outcome eventuates, Britain may well enjoy a short period of self-congratulation for seeing the writing on the wall. Noel Bird Boreen Point, Queensland, Australia Censorship by Facebook I read with interest the Norwegian prime minister, Erna Solberg, commenting on the recent furore over Facebook\u2019s censoring of the iconic image taken during the American war in Vietnam (16 September). The horrific image depicts Kim Ph\u00fac, as a young girl, running down a road near Trang Bang, her naked body spattered with burning napalm. Solberg states, \u201cI want my children, and other children around the world, to grow up in a society where history is told as it was. In a society where they can grow into mature adults by learning from experiences of past generations, to be better informed citizens of the world.\u201d I could not agree more. War is not only cruel because of the people that perpetrate violence. It is also cruel because of the people who fuel it. When I see this picture I see napalm. When I think napalm, I think of the Norwegian government permitting Norway to be one of the biggest suppliers of magnesium to the US production of napalm in the 50s. Cut to the present day. Norway is still a major-league global supplier of weapons (per capita). The Norwegian female ski-jumping team and Norwegian biathletes are sponsored by the Norwegian-US arms producer Nammo. Nobody is learning anything. Erna Solberg is just telling it as it is. Patji Aln\u00e6s-Katjavivi Oslo, Norway Rise of the Anthropocene The Anthropocene, according to ecologist James Lovelock, can be traced back to 1712 when the first steam engine began operation (9 September). Later, of course, we became even more inventive and began ransacking the energy stored in the Earth. The Industrial Revolution\u2019s carbon emissions and the \u201cplastic pollution\u201d that has now spilled over into our oceans, are just two of the major, and not entirely foreseen, consequences. But the most serious development that defines our epoch according to Lovelock, in his latest book A Rough Ride to the Future, is overpopulation. \u201cGaia, the Earth System,\u201d he says, \u201ccannot sustain the present level of human population for very much longer.\u201d Richard Orlando Westmount, Quebec, Canada Mindful of mindfulness Terry Eagleton, in his review of The Happiness Industry (26 August), does the notion of mindfulness an injustice. At the recent Mind and Life Conference with the Dalai Lama in Brussels on Power and Care, we were reminded that the pursuit of happiness involves also doing our best to reduce suffering in the world. Training in mindfulness can help some to break out of the bonds of powerlessness and feel their own strength to become better advocates for global justice. As temporary residents on this planet, we have the power and the responsibility to care enough to be, to the best of our ability, active in making a positive difference for the benefit of all creatures today and tomorrow. Silvia Dingwall Nussbaumen, Switzerland Briefly \u2022 I can fully sympathise with Anthony Walter (Briefly, 2 September) and his difficulty with mystifying terms used in the Weekly. It isn\u2019t just North Americans who may be flummoxed by new words that appear to have entered common parlance. I have increasingly found that my vocabulary is out of date, so that playing Scrabble creates confusion when my (1960s) dictionary doesn\u2019t contain a word that my visiting daughter thinks is commonplace. Maybe I need to get a new dictionary. Katy Beaver Glacis, Mahe, Seychelles \u2022 So London bankers consider brown shoes a determinant of failure (9 September).

Avril Taylor Dundas, Ontario, Canada \u2022 With regard to your 19 August article (Peta: change name of Eggs and Bacon Bay) I am hopefully reminded of Gandhi\u2019s saying: \u201cFirst they ignore you, then they ridicule you, then they fight you, and then you win.\u201d It is not just that the name encourages poor dietary choices; it encourages a callousness toward the suffering of \u201cfood\u201d animals and a disregard for the environment that we cannot afford.

Not exactly the \u201cnew relationship\u201d that Trudeau announced to rapturous international applause.</p> <p>And then there\u2019s what hasn\u2019t made the headlines. In British Columbia, Quebec, the Atlantic provinces and elsewhere through Canada, there are scores of First Nations who have never signed away their Aboriginal title through treaties. For years they\u2019ve racked up debt while in negotiations with the government over lands sought after by mineral, forestry, hydro and oil companies. But as a pre-condition for any compensation, they\u2019re <a href=\"https://ricochet.media/en/1154/trudeau-cloaks-continued-attack-on-first-nations-sovereignty-with-charm\">forced to extinguish</a> their rights to 9 out of every 10 parcels of their territory\u2014rivers, forests, mountains, farmland, and everything underneath.</p> <p>Fair to have expected a change under Trudeau? Instead the Liberals have given negotiators marching orders from a Harper-commissioned report that <a href=\"https://ricochet.media/en/125/harper-first-nations-assimilation-agenda\">advises</a> how to force through energy infrastructure. That\u2019s because Indigenous rights stand in the way of pipelines, mega-dams like Site C, giant fracked gas terminals\u2014and $650bn in resource projects over the next ten years that the Liberals are trumpeting as much as the Conservatives did.</p> <p>Never mind that recent Supreme Court decisions, and the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples before them, call for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/true-north/2014/oct/21/the-indigenous-land-rights-ruling-that-could-transform-canada\">shared sovereignty or management</a> over these lands. Or that many more Canadians are realizing that Indigenous stewardship of large swathes of territory\u2014instead of its mismanagement by multi-national corporations\u2014would be to the benefit of everyone. </p> <p>Trudeau may indeed want to do right by Indigenous peoples, but the government is locked into a logic of its own: quietly maintaining exclusive control over Indigenous peoples\u2019 lands and resources. Is this what Trudeau meant when he said his government would \u201cthink seven generations out\u201d?</p> <p>Turning the language of liberation into a contraption of conquest is nothing new: it\u2019s part of Liberal heritage. In the early 1990s, as calls for Indigenous self-determination gained steam on the heels of widespread protest and the Oka crisis, the Liberals appeared to embrace the movement\u2019s demand. They named their policy \u201cthe Inherent Right to Self-Government.\u201d </p> <p>Yet this policy\u2014still on the books\u2014only grants First Nations rights such as policing, education, and the licensing of marriages; the government keeps all powers of trade, diplomacy and serious economic development and decision-making to themselves. No wonder Indigenous critics have said it turns First Nations into \u201cethnic municipalities\u201d: it is nothing like a genuine third-order of government. </p> <p>The Liberals latest utterances appear just as soothingly promising: \u201creconciliation,\u201d \u201cnation-to-nation,\u201d even \u201cdecolonization.\u201d The most slippery of all has been their use of \u201cconsent.\u201d Though the Liberals have proclaimed their support for the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples\u2014at whose heart lies the right of \u201cfree, prior and informed consent\u201d\u2014they\u2019ve been loath to recognize it in practice on the ground. </p> <p>It\u2019s obvious why: the right of consent sends shudders through corporate boardrooms whose goodwill the Liberals covet. As an alternative, the government has <a href=\"http://aptn.ca/news/2016/05/09/trudeau-government-eyeing-nwts-collaborate-consent-model-as-part-of-undrip-implementation/\">wheeled</a> out a hazy concept of \u201ccollaborative consent.\u201d All that\u2019s clear is it studiously avoids recognizing the actual right to say no to destructive resource projects. Indigenous feminists have <a href=\"http://landbodydefense.org/\">underlined</a> the hollowness of this half-measure: whether it\u2019s territories or bodies, if you don\u2019t have the power to say no, then \u201cconsent\u201d is meaningless.</p> <p>The extractivist worldview\u2014bent on treating everything as a commodity\u2014that lay behind Stephen Harper\u2019s resource agenda just as powerfully shapes Trudeau\u2019s. In fact, the Liberals\u2019 attempt to wrap themselves in the UN Declaration without embracing its central right may constitute a new, more subtle form of extraction: the extraction from Indigenous territory of consent itself.</p> <p>Liberal moves to extract and manufacture consent and support for outdated policies are evident elsewhere: restoring funding to the Assembly of First Nations, a government-dependent organization that has since plumped frequently for them; appointing an Indigenous Justice Minister, even though Indigenous critics argue she has sided with the government agenda throughout her political career; and agreeing to call an inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women, but with a <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/missing-women-marion-buller-reaction-mmiw-inquiry-1.3705804\">mandate</a> far short of what impacted families wanted. As the weight of reality presses against Trudeau\u2019s rhetoric, the ability to generate consent is crumbling.</p> <p>Reconciliation is a powerful hope, an uplifting prospect, a deeply desired new relationship that Trudeau has compellingly invoked. But if reconciliation does not include the restitution of land, the recognition of real self-government, the reigning in of abusive police, the remediation of rivers and forests, it will remain a vacant notion, a cynical ploy to preserve a status quo in need not of tinkering but transformation. It will be Canada\u2019s latest in beads and trinkets, a cheap simulation of justice.<br></p> <p>The good news is that Indigenous peoples have never been more poised to push Trudeau from mere words to deeds. Idle No More left a profound imprint: a more readily mobilized Indigenous population and a far larger non-Indigenous reservoir of support. An influential presence on social media, a growing force in art and culture, Indigenous peoples are <a href=\"http:// http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/fish-farm-protests-1.3737728\">leveraging</a> Supreme Court precedents and trying to rebuild their economies and nations.<br></p> <p>They have endured too much to be satisfied with Trudeau attending a pow wow, flashing a Haida tattoo on his arm, or calling for yet another consultation and study. If Canadians are willing to do their part, Indigenous peoples can test Trudeau\u2019s lofty rhetoric the most effective way possible: in the crucible of a rising movement.<br></p> <p><em>On twitter</em>: <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/Martin_Lukacs\"><em>@Martin_Lukacs</em></a></p>",

In the early 1990s, as calls for Indigenous self-determination gained steam on the heels of widespread protest and the Oka crisis, the Liberals appeared to embrace the movement\u2019s demand. They named their policy \u201cthe Inherent Right to Self-Government.\u201d Yet this policy\u2014still on the books\u2014only grants First Nations rights such as policing, education, and the licensing of marriages; the government keeps all powers of trade, diplomacy and serious economic development and decision-making to themselves. No wonder Indigenous critics have said it turns First Nations into \u201cethnic municipalities\u201d: it is nothing like a genuine third-order of government. The Liberals latest utterances appear just as soothingly promising: \u201creconciliation,\u201d \u201cnation-to-nation,\u201d even \u201cdecolonization.\u201d The most slippery of all has been their use of \u201cconsent.\u201d Though the Liberals have proclaimed their support for the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples\u2014at whose heart lies the right of \u201cfree, prior and informed consent\u201d\u2014they\u2019ve been loath to recognize it in practice on the ground. It\u2019s obvious why: the right of consent sends shudders through corporate boardrooms whose goodwill the Liberals covet. As an alternative, the government has wheeled out a hazy concept of \u201ccollaborative consent.\u201d All that\u2019s clear is it studiously avoids recognizing the actual right to say no to destructive resource projects. Indigenous feminists have underlined the hollowness of this half-measure: whether it\u2019s territories or bodies, if you don\u2019t have the power to say no, then \u201cconsent\u201d is meaningless. The extractivist worldview\u2014bent on treating everything as a commodity\u2014that lay behind Stephen Harper\u2019s resource agenda just as powerfully shapes Trudeau\u2019s. In fact, the Liberals\u2019 attempt to wrap themselves in the UN Declaration without embracing its central right may constitute a new, more subtle form of extraction: the extraction from Indigenous territory of consent itself. Liberal moves to extract and manufacture consent and support for outdated policies are evident elsewhere: restoring funding to the Assembly of First Nations, a government-dependent organization that has since plumped frequently for them; appointing an Indigenous Justice Minister, even though Indigenous critics argue she has sided with the government agenda throughout her political career; and agreeing to call an inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women, but with a mandate far short of what impacted families wanted. As the weight of reality presses against Trudeau\u2019s rhetoric, the ability to generate consent is crumbling. Reconciliation is a powerful hope, an uplifting prospect, a deeply desired new relationship that Trudeau has compellingly invoked. But if reconciliation does not include the restitution of land, the recognition of real self-government, the reigning in of abusive police, the remediation of rivers and forests, it will remain a vacant notion, a cynical ploy to preserve a status quo in need not of tinkering but transformation. It will be Canada\u2019s latest in beads and trinkets, a cheap simulation of justice. The good news is that Indigenous peoples have never been more poised to push Trudeau from mere words to deeds. Idle No More left a profound imprint: a more readily mobilized Indigenous population and a far larger non-Indigenous reservoir of support. An influential presence on social media, a growing force in art and culture, Indigenous peoples are leveraging Supreme Court precedents and trying to rebuild their economies and nations. They have endured too much to be satisfied with Trudeau attending a pow wow, flashing a Haida tattoo on his arm, or calling for yet another consultation and study. If Canadians are willing to do their part, Indigenous peoples can test Trudeau\u2019s lofty rhetoric the most effective way possible: in the crucible of a rising movement.
