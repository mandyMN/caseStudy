          "body": "<p>The two Canadian citizens detained in China on espionage allegations have been formally arrested, in a move likely to further chill relations between the two countries.</p> <p>Chinese officials have accused <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/11/michael-kovrig-detained-china-former-canadian-diplomat\">Michael Kovrig</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/12/china-canada-diplomat-michael-kovrig-detention-latest-\">Michael Spavor</a> with stealing state secrets for a foreign organisation, a serious allegation which in its most extreme cases can result in the death penalty.</p> <p>For months, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/canada\">Canada</a> has called for the release of Kovrig and Spavor, decrying what officials say are flimsy accusations against the two men.</p> <p>Kovrig, a former diplomat, and Spavor, an entrepreneur who frequently led tours to North Korea, were both detained by Chinese officials in December last year. For months, the pair have been held in a detention facility without access to a lawyer and been granted a single consular visit per month. There is no indication when the two will be formally charged or go on trial.</p> <p>\u201cCanada strongly condemns their arbitrary arrest as we condemned their arbitrary detention on December 10,\u201d said Canada\u2019s foreign affairs department in a statement on Thursday. \u201cWe reiterate our demand that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/china\">China </a>immediately release Mr Kovrig and Mr Spavor.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/may/16/how-other-countries-are-responding-to-trump-huawei-threat\">How other countries are responding to Trump's Huawei threat</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The formal arrests of the two are widely seen as retaliation for Canada\u2019s apprehension of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/huawei\">Huawei</a>\u2019s CFO <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/dec/05/meng-wanzhou-huawei-cfo-arrested-vancouver\">Meng Wanzhou</a> at Vancouver airport on 1 December. The telecoms executive is fighting extradition proceedings to the US, where American officials allege she committed fraud. China immediately called for her release following the arrest and closely watched court appearances.</p> <p>Amid pressure from Beijing, Ottawa has repeatedly stated that Canada\u2019s justice system is immune from political interference.</p> <p>On Thursday, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman deployed similar language to rebut Canada\u2019s frustrations over the arrests of Kovrig and Spavor.</p> <p>\u201cWe always act in accordance with the law, and we hope that Canada will not make irresponsible remarks on China\u2019s legal construction and judicial handling,\u201d said Lu Kang at a news conference.</p> <p>The escalation of charges against Spavor and Kovrig are the latest in a growing list of hostile actions taken by the Chinese government against Canada. Robert Schellenberg, a Canadian citizen, is facing the death penalty for allegations of drug smuggling \u2013 a charge that was reapplied following the arrest of Meng. China has also taken aim at Canada\u2019s multibillion-dollar canola industry, effectively closing off all imports of the Canadian rapeseed oil.</p> <p>In recent weeks, Canada has increased pressure on its allies to assist the two men. On 9 May, Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, spoke with the US president, Donald Trump, about \u201crelations with China, including the arbitrary detention of two Canadian citizens in China and Canada\u2019s ongoing efforts to secure their release\u201d, the prime minister\u2019s office said in a statement.</p> <p>The US, however, remained locked in tense negotiations with China. On Wednesday night, Trump signed an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/15/donald-trump-national-emergency-telecoms-threats-huawei\">executive order</a> declaring an economic national emergency \u2013 a move that effectively bars Huawei\u2019s telecommunications technology from the country.</p>",

          "bodyText": "The two Canadian citizens detained in China on espionage allegations have been formally arrested, in a move likely to further chill relations between the two countries. Chinese officials have accused Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor with stealing state secrets for a foreign organisation, a serious allegation which in its most extreme cases can result in the death penalty. For months, Canada has called for the release of Kovrig and Spavor, decrying what officials say are flimsy accusations against the two men. Kovrig, a former diplomat, and Spavor, an entrepreneur who frequently led tours to North Korea, were both detained by Chinese officials in December last year. For months, the pair have been held in a detention facility without access to a lawyer and been granted a single consular visit per month. There is no indication when the two will be formally charged or go on trial. \u201cCanada strongly condemns their arbitrary arrest as we condemned their arbitrary detention on December 10,\u201d said Canada\u2019s foreign affairs department in a statement on Thursday. \u201cWe reiterate our demand that China immediately release Mr Kovrig and Mr Spavor.\u201d The formal arrests of the two are widely seen as retaliation for Canada\u2019s apprehension of Huawei\u2019s CFO Meng Wanzhou at Vancouver airport on 1 December. The telecoms executive is fighting extradition proceedings to the US, where American officials allege she committed fraud. China immediately called for her release following the arrest and closely watched court appearances. Amid pressure from Beijing, Ottawa has repeatedly stated that Canada\u2019s justice system is immune from political interference. On Thursday, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman deployed similar language to rebut Canada\u2019s frustrations over the arrests of Kovrig and Spavor. \u201cWe always act in accordance with the law, and we hope that Canada will not make irresponsible remarks on China\u2019s legal construction and judicial handling,\u201d said Lu Kang at a news conference. The escalation of charges against Spavor and Kovrig are the latest in a growing list of hostile actions taken by the Chinese government against Canada. Robert Schellenberg, a Canadian citizen, is facing the death penalty for allegations of drug smuggling \u2013 a charge that was reapplied following the arrest of Meng. China has also taken aim at Canada\u2019s multibillion-dollar canola industry, effectively closing off all imports of the Canadian rapeseed oil. In recent weeks, Canada has increased pressure on its allies to assist the two men. On 9 May, Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, spoke with the US president, Donald Trump, about \u201crelations with China, including the arbitrary detention of two Canadian citizens in China and Canada\u2019s ongoing efforts to secure their release\u201d, the prime minister\u2019s office said in a statement. The US, however, remained locked in tense negotiations with China. On Wednesday night, Trump signed an executive order declaring an economic national emergency \u2013 a move that effectively bars Huawei\u2019s telecommunications technology from the country.",

We have decided to act.\u201d Ardern said the Christchurch attack was \u201ctruly unprecedented in its use of social media and subsequent spread of the terrorist\u2019s message. Fifty-one men, women and children from the New Zealand Muslim community were killed, and were killed online. Initially the live stream was watched by only a few hundred people but it was then shared and spread online at such a pace that YouTube recorded one upload per second on their platform in the first 24 hours.\u201d She added: \u201cNever have so many countries and tech companies come together in reaction to such an attack to work together to use new technology and develop new technology so our communities are safer. \u201cToday must be day one of change. The Christchurch Call is a roadmap for action. It\u2019s a nine-point commitment that I hope will bring lead to further change \u2026 to eliminate terrorism from the networks.\u201d She said she hoped it would lead to a \u201cmore human internet that cannot be used by terrorists for their hateful purposes\u201d. Macron said things were moving in the right direction and the presence of the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, and his \u201cpersonal engagement\u201d was encouraging. \u201cThey said they support the objectives they will do all to cooperation, they haven\u2019t formally signed up to the Christchurch Call but we will do all we can to have a more concrete and formal engagement. The fact the US administration has said it shares our objectives is a positive element,\u201d Macron said. He said the Christchurch Call differed from previous initiatives to clean up the internet, because of the involvement of tech companies and its worldwide appeal. Ardern said Facebook had made a changes to its livestreaming, announced at the same time as the summit, under which the Christchurch terrorist \u201cwould not have been able to livestream his act of violence\u201d. She said: \u201cThat is just one element of the work of we must do. Ultimately we want to be in a position to prevent harm in the first place, to make sure that lives aren\u2019t lost.\u201d",

          "bodyText": "Subscribe now to receive the morning briefing by email. Good morning, I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s essential stories. Alabama law bans abortion without exceptions for rape and incest A group of 25 male Republicans in the Alabama senate voted on Tuesday to pass the US\u2019s strictest abortion law, banning all terminations at any stage of pregnancy, without exceptions for rape or incest. The legislation passed through the GOP-dominated state senate by 25-6, making it a class A felony for doctors to perform abortions. It must now be signed by the state\u2019s governor, Kay Ivey, and will almost certainly face an immediate court challenge that could result in it heading to the supreme court \u2013 arguably the intention of its backers, who seem to be hoping the court will end up overturning the 1973 decision that legalised the procedure across the US. State bans. Alabama is one of more than a dozen US states where there have been attempts to outlaw abortion this year alone, and at least six other states have already passed blanket bans. Hardline group. The national effort to push such bans has been orchestrated by a hardline anti-abortion group, Faith2Action, which has promoted \u201cmodel legislation\u201d to help individual states construct their bills. \u2018Terrifying\u2019 Ebola epidemic spirals amid conflict in DRC An out-of-control Ebola epidemic sweeping through a conflict-riven region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo could end up being as severe as the outbreak that devastated three west African countries from 2013 to 2016. Experts and aid agencies have warned they are struggling to contain the \u201cmassive\u201d and \u201cterrifying\u201d outbreak, with new cases increasing at their fastest rate since the outbreak began last year, amid regular bursts of violence between armed groups in a region with no functioning government. Historic outbreak. The Ebola outbreak in eastern DRC is already the second-largest in history, with more than 1,600 cases and almost 1,100 deaths. Here are the key facts about the epidemic and its context. Local mistrust. The outbreak is being exacerbated by a mistrust of health workers, as Esdras Tsongo reports from Butembo, where the epidemic began. British general contradicts US claim of increased Iran threat The top British general in the US-led coalition against Isis has directly contradicted White House claims of an increased threat from Iran, exposing tensions among western allies as the US continues its military buildup in the region. Maj Gen Christopher Ghika said on Tuesday that there was no sign of a burgeoning threat from Iranian-backed forces in Syria or Iraq, but his statement was swiftly contradicted by US Central Command. Putin meeting. A Kremlin spokesman said the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, \u201ccould not understand\u201d the US policy of \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d against Iran, as Putin met with the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, in Moscow on Tuesday. Donald Trump Jr reaches deal to testify before Senate Donald Trump Jr has agreed to testify before the Senate intelligence committee at a closed-door session next month, after threatening to resist a subpoena to give evidence in the committee\u2019s Russia investigation. Meanwhile, the directors of the CIA and FBI are assisting the US attorney general, William Barr, in a new inquiry into the origins of the Mueller investigation. John Durham, the US attorney in Connecticut, will lead the inquiry, which was apparently prompted by Donald Trump\u2019s repeated accusations that the justice department and FBI unlawfully spied on his campaign. Trade war. As his trade war with China continued to roil global markets on Tuesday, the president claimed the US\u2019s \u201cgreat patriot farmers\u201d \u2013 likely to be the first affected by new Chinese tariffs \u2013 would in fact benefit from the dispute. Crib sheet San Francisco has become the first US city to ban the use of facial recognition technology by police and other government agencies. Single-use plastic contributes to greenhouse gas emissions at every stage of its life cycle \u2013 from production to its management as waste \u2013 and thus poses a serious climate hazard, a report warns. The US National Labor Relations Board has ruled Uber drivers are independent contractors, not employees, dealing a heavy blow to their campaign for greater rights and making it more difficult for drivers to organise for better working conditions. Peruvian archaeologists have expressed outrage at plans to build a new international airport in the Inca town of Chinchero, designed to bring tourists directly to Macchu Picchu. Must-reads The Native American lawmaker defying Trump\u2019s drilling push Last year, Deb Haaland, the Democratic representative from New Mexico, was one of the first two Native American women elected to Congress. She is using her position to push back against the Trump administration\u2019s targeting of public lands, as she explains to Jimmy Tobias. When climate change came to the Midwest In March, the Missouri River burst its banks up and down Iowa, causing the worst floods in the region in living memory. While many Republicans in the state still regard climate change as no real threat, some communities could be swept off the map by dramatic shifts in weather, as Chris McGreal reports. How Muslim athletes compete during Ramadan The holy month began at the start of May this year. From the NFL to the NBA to triathlon, Michael Weinreb finds that while some Muslim athletes find fasting and exercise a difficult mix, for others, the discipline can also improve their focus. The firm helping hacking victims by paying ransoms When a strain of ransomware known as SamSam paralyzed computer networks across North America, the FBI said the hackers were beyond the reach of law enforcement. But a company called Proven Data Recovery helped users regain control of their computers, by paying the ransoms, as Renee Dudley and Jeff Kao report. Opinion After Alabama\u2019s blanket ban on abortion, Roe v Wade itself is under threat, writes B Jessie Hill. And with the supreme court\u2019s current configuration, there is no guarantee the landmark decision will be protected. Since Justice Anthony Kennedy retired last year and was replaced by Brett Kavanaugh, the five-justice majority on the US supreme court has unquestionably disagreed with Roe v Wade. Sport The Pelicans have won the NBA draft lottery for the first time since 2012, which means Zion Williamson will most likely be moving to New Orleans next month. Ron Wyden, the US Senator from Oregon, has asked the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, to guarantee \u201csafe passage\u201d for the Portland Trail Blazers player Enes Kanter if his team play the Toronto Raptors in Canada in the NBA finals. The Turkish center is an outspoken critic of Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, whose government has sought his extradition on terrorism charges, which he denies.

          "bodyText": "The Alabama senate continued debating into the night over proposed legislation that would make it a crime to perform an abortion at any stage of pregnancy. Our colleague Erin Durkin will follow the issue, which may or may not include vasectomy ban amendment! Donald Trump Jr. has reportedly agreed to testify before the Senate intelligence committee, according to the New York Times. The House judiciary committee sent a letter to the Justice Department regarding the agency\u2019s handling of civil rights violations by law enforcement. The House judiciary committee sent a letter Tuesday to the Justice Department, requesting documents and information pertaining to the agency\u2019s oversight of potential civil rights violations by law enforcement: Despite continuing concerns from civil rights and community-based organizations, the Department has sharply curtailed its statutory role in identifying and eradicating civil rights abuses by law enforcement. Excessive force in police-civilian encounters presents a crisis of trust throughout our nation. Changes to Department policy and failure to uphold the law run the risk of undermining federal oversight authority in this space. The letter requests information related to the consent decrees and complaints, communications related to former attorney general Jeff Sessions\u2019 memos regarding consent decrees and an update on all current investigations into use of force by police departments such as those in Chicago, Baltimore and Ferguson. Alabama state senator Vivian Davis Figures proposed an amendment to make vasectomies a felony in response to legislation that would essentially criminalize abortion. It may seem a little eye-for-an-eye, but it\u2019s a tactic that been used in the pro-choice fight before. In March, Georgia state representative Dar\u2019shun Kendrick drafted a \u201ctesticular bill of rights\u201d in response to the legislation signed into law this week that bans abortions once cardiac activity is detected (which can be as early as six weeks). This bill of rights would ban vasectomy procedures, consider men having sex without a condom as \u201caggravated assault\u201d and require DNA testing of a fetus when a woman is 6 weeks and 1 day pregnant to determine the father \u201cwho shall IMMEDIATELY start paying child support.\u201d It looks like this wasn\u2019t Georgia\u2019s first brush with trying to prohibit vasectomies in response to legislators trying to restrict abortions. In 2012, state Representative Yasmin Neal introduced a bill in response to legislation looking to criminalize abortions performed after 20 weeks. \u201cThousands of children are deprived of birth in this state every year because of the lack of state regulation over vasectomies,\u201d the bill read. \u201cThere is substantial evidence that unregulated vasectomies result in fewer unwanted pregnancies and, by extension, fewer births. It is patently unfair that men can avoid the rewards of unwanted fatherhood by presuming that their judgment over such matters is more valid than the judgment of the General Assembly.\u201d Read more on the Alabama abortion bill here: Some more updates from Montgomery, Alabama, where our colleague Erin Durkin is reporting on that the state senate is consider a near-total ban on abortion that would make it a crime to perform one at any stage of pregnancy: Some news from the west coast: California joined in on a lawsuit, announced Monday, with Washington, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Oregon. Turns out that was California\u2019s 50th lawsuit against the Trump administration. Here\u2019s a quick rundown of some of the issues that California has tussled over with the Trump administration: According to the Los Angeles Times, the last record was 48 lawsuits, filed by the Republican attorneys general in Texas against the Obama administration \u201con issues such as healthcare, immigration, climate change and transgender bathroom policies\u201d. The New York Times is reporting that Donald Trump Jr. and the Senate intelligence committee reached a deal Tuesday for his forthcoming testimony on Capitol Hill: The compromise was an appearance by Mr. Trump in the middle of June, with questions limited to about a half-dozen topics, with the time no longer than two to four hours, according to a person briefed. Another person, who would not be identified, contested that the scope was of the topics had been limited. If you\u2019ll take a quick stroll down memory lane, the Senate intelligence committee subpoenaed the president\u2019s eldest son six days ago in relation to his 2017 testimony on the Russia investigation. Since then, the president has come out in defense of his son, claiming that the Mueller report exonerated Trump Jr. Robert Mueller did not absolve the president\u2019s son of wrongdoing , but he declined to prosecute him. Hey all, Vivian Ho taking over for Tom McCarthy. Our colleague Erin Durkin is in Alabama at the moment, where lawmakers are considering abortion legislation. We\u2019ll keep you updated on what goes down here. Here\u2019s a summary of the day thus far: Donald Trump praised attorney general William Barr for opening what appears to be a broad investigation of the Russia counterespionage investigation that swept up the Trump campaign. Barr appointed a US attorney to lead the inquiry and reportedly has got the CIA and DNI involved. Trump described retaliatory tariffs as \u201ca little squabble with China\u201d. The Dow Jones climbed .82% on Tuesday after big drops on Monday. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with Vladimir Putin in Russia. The sides discussed areas for further cooperation. Pompeo said he warned Russia not to interfere in the 2020 election. The House set a date of 21 May for former White House counsel Don McGahn to testify before the judiciary committee. It\u2019s unclear whether he\u2019ll appear. Senator Elizabeth Warren took a \u201chard pass\u201d on an offer to do a Fox News town hall event, calling the network \u201chate-for-profit\u201d. Trump said he didn\u2019t know anything about a reported Pentagon plan, just in case, for how to send 120,000 troops to the Middle East in a conflict with Iran. Steve Bullock, Montana\u2019s Democrat governor, became the 23rd candidate (and counting) to enter the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. Trump wraps his Louisiana speech. With piped-in Rolling Stones to see him off, just like 2016. Here we go again. Trump is speaking in Louisiana. So far he\u2019s made fun of Democratic candidate Pete Buttigieg\u2019s name, referred to Elizabeth Warren as \u201cPocahontas\u201d and promised a \u201cbrand-new I-10 bridge\u201d for the region \u201cif we win this election\u201d. Applause lines all. Follow along here: Senator Ron Wyden has written a letter to Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau asking for assurances of safe passage for Portland Trail Blazers star Enes Kanter if the Oregon-based team meets the Toronto Raptors in the NBA finals, as could happen. There are concerns that Kanter, who is Turkish and a critic of Recep Tayyip Erdogan, could be targeted by the Erdogan government. Wyden\u2019s letter, first reported by ESPN, read in part: I ask your government to facilitate Mr. Kanter\u2019s safe passage to and from Canada should the Portland Trail Blazers play the Toronto Raptors in Toronto, Canada, in the upcoming NBA Finals. I also urge your government to state publicly that it will not comply with any Interpol red notice meant to interfere with Mr. Kanter\u2019s livelihood and to intimidate him and his family back in Turkey. It turns out that Trump is thrilled with the way Barr is going after his perceived political opponents, who through another lens were career justice department employees pursuing an investigation of foreign sabotage of a US election. It was announced yesterday that former president Carter, 94, broke his hip while preparing to go turkey hunting and had to undergo surgery. Having a little fun? \u201cTrump socks\u2019 Here\u2019s footage from Pompeo\u2019s meeting with Putin. In these preliminary remarks, Putin touts bilateral ties. Pompeo says Trump sent him to find ways for the countries to work together. Is this the Trump administration that has supposedly been so tough on Russia, to believe Mitch McConnell? In remarks to reporters before leaving the White House today, Trump described the retaliatory tariffs between the United States and China as \u201ca little squabble\u201d: \u201cWe\u2019re having a little squabble with China because we\u2019ve been treated very very unfairly for many decades.. I think it\u2019s going to turn out extremely well, we\u2019re in a very strong position.\u201d Here\u2019s senator Lindsey Graham carrying water for Donald Trump in discouraging the idea of Donald Trump Jr testifying before the Senate, which has demanded that Trump Jr appear. To review, that\u2019s Graham turning on his Republican colleagues in the senate on behalf of the president: Nicholas Geale, a top Labor Department official, is leaving the Trump administration over a clash with White House officials, Axios reports. The report says that the officials considered Geale to be \u201cpersonally difficult and as an impediment to President Trump\u2019s deregulatory agenda.\u201d Axios: A source who is close to the president and has direct knowledge of the situation told me: \u201cThe pace of change has not been sufficient. [Sec. Acosta] tends to be fairly fearful of taking hardline positions. He tends to be solicitous of the unions, often making the argument that that\u2019s what the president wants.\u201d Attorney General William Barr is working with CIA Director Gina Haspel and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats to examine intelligence methods used during the Russia investigation, the Associated Press reports: That\u2019s according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke to The Associated Press on Tuesday. The person could not discuss the matter publicly and requested anonymity. Barr has appointed John Durham, the U.S. attorney in Connecticut, to lead the inquiry into the origins of the Russia investigation and the intelligence methods used during the probe. But the person said Barr remains directly involved in the probe. The person said similar, separate investigations by the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general and another U.S. attorney are winding down. All indications are that Barr has set out to place the full resources of the justice department behind Trump\u2019s demands that the FBI investigation of his campaign, which at the time was in secret contact with Russians sabotaging the US election, be investigated. If you squint it can look like Trump has succeed in hijacking the justice department for his own political ends, in this case an investigation of his political opponents. The Muslim Public Affairs Council has released a statement accusing Trump of shunning American Muslims by failing to invite them \u2013 for a second consecutive year \u2013 to the White House Iftar. The statement, first reported by Talking Points Memo, read: Tonight marks another year when President Trump fails to invite American Muslims during the month of Ramadan. Instead, foreign ambassadors and dignitaries from Muslim-majority countries comprise the guest list for tonight\u2019s iftar. Many of those he did invite represent autocratic and repressive governments, regimes that routinely oppress innocent citizens and violate the rights of women, minorities and free-thinking people. Hillary Clinton started the tradition of the White House Iftar (the daily fast-breaking dinner) in 1996 when she served as First Lady. Since 1996, when then-First Lady Hillary Clinton began the tradition, this event has been a staple of both Republican and Democratic administrations. It\u2019s served as an opportunity to celebrate Ramadan with the American Muslim community, the leaders of its civic groups, its imams, its writers, artists, and entertainers. After canceling the White House iftar two years ago, President Trump broke away from this great tradition. This year, he has continued the tradition MPAC initiated over 20 years ago -- but for the past two years, no American Muslim organizations or leaders were invited. This is not surprising, through his exclusively foreign guest list he is perpetuating the narrative Islam is foreign to America and that American Muslims are not an integral part of our social fabric. Once again, the White House refuses to acknowledge the existence and contributions of American Muslims at the annual White House Iftar. US secretary of state Mike Pompeo told Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Tuesday that Washington would not tolerate any Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election in 2020, Reuters reports: Speaking at a news conference after holding talks with Lavrov in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi, Pompeo said he had made it clear to Russia that there could be no repeat of election interference of the kind Washington accuses Moscow of undertaking in the 2016 presidential election. Russia denies the allegation it meddled in that election. Contrary to previous reports and this earlier blog block, district judge Amie Mehta does not intend to rule today on a challenge by the president to a House subpoena for eight years\u2019 worth of accounting documents. The ruling could defuse a tense standoff between Trump and congress \u2013 or send the country further towards a bona fide constitutional crisis. Britain Eakin of Courthouse News is in the room: Read Eakin\u2019s timeline for a play-by-play. The hearing has just concluded with a final statement by Douglas Letter, general counsel for the House of Representatives: Campaigning in New Hampshire, former vice president Joe Biden says that post-Trump, Republicans will become a party of compromising partners in government: Why not? CNN analyst Harry Enten points out that even if it ain\u2019t true, the idea polls well: Appearing on The View talk show this morning, Texas Representative and presidential hopeful Beto O\u2019Rourke admits it might not have been the best idea to launch his presidential campaign on the cover of Vanity Fair: Picking up on Trump\u2019s suggestion earlier today that his son Donald Jr has testified enough, the Republican chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, which has subpoenaed Trump Jr for further testimony, declines to say what would happen next in the frankly rather extremely plausible event that Trump Jr defies the subpoena: Perfect timing for this discovery, as US secretary of state Mike Pompeo is about to meet with Russian president Vladimir Putin and can bring this up: It\u2019s unclear when the hacking occurred. Update: this referred to hacking activity in 2016. Trump spoke with reporters briefly before departing for New Orleans. He suggested that his son, Donald Jr, who has been subpoenaed to testify by the Republican-led Senate intelligence committee, had already testified enough (members have Congress have expressed concern that Trump Jr might have misled them). Trump also addressed a New York Times report from yesterday with this eye-popping lede: WASHINGTON \u2014 At a meeting of President Trump\u2019s top national security aides last Thursday, Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan presented an updated military plan that envisions sending as many as 120,000 troops to the Middle East should Iran attack American forces or accelerate work on nuclear weapons, administration officials said. Never heard of it, Trump tells reporters. The House Judiciary panel has set a 21 May hearing for testimony from former White House counsel Don McGahn, a key figure in special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, the Associated Press reports: But it\u2019s unclear if he\u2019ll show. The committee posted notice Tuesday of the hearing. McGahn was a vital witness for Mueller\u2019s probe into Russia election meddling and contacts with Donald Trump\u2019s campaign. McGahn told Mueller of Trump\u2019s attempts to thwart his investigation and remove Mueller. The White House has said McGahn cannot turn over documents the committee seeks and prefers he not testify, reflecting Trump\u2019s strategy of resisting congressional investigations. Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler has said the committee would hold McGahn in contempt if he does not appear at the hearing. An attorney for McGahn didn\u2019t immediately respond for comment Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator running for president, has declined to follow the lead of fellow Democrats who have either appeared in or committed to appear in town halls organized by Fox News. In rejecting the offer, Warren says she does not want to feed the Fox \u201chate-for-profit\u201d machine and accuses the network of giving \u201ca megaphone to racists and conspiracists\u201d: And then there were 23. Steve Bullock, the Democratic governor of Montana, announced on Tuesday that he is entering the presidential race after pushing a progressive agenda in a conservative state. Among a crowded field of more than 20 Democratic candidates, Bullock attempted to distinguish himself in his campaign launch video by touting his ability to work with Republicans and his record of fighting corporate spending in elections. \u201cI don\u2019t have the luxury of just talking to people who agree with me,\u201d Bullock said in the video. In the 2016 election, Donald Trump won Montana by 21 percentage points and Bullock was re-elected by 4 percentage points. Before Montana voters elected Bullock governor in 2012, he was the state\u2019s attorney general. The 53-year-old supported same-sex marriage, expanded access to the federal health insurance plan Medicaid and protected public lands. He is also pro-choice and supports an assault weapons ban. Read further: US secretary of state Mike Pompeo is to meet Vladimir Putin in Russia at a time of heightened fears of a clash between the US and Iran, a Moscow ally. It is the first high-level meeting between US and Russian leaders since the partial release of the Mueller report, which at length documents the Russian sabotage of the 2016 election. Donald Trump and Putin spoke on the phone shortly after the report was published. A Kremlin spokesman, before the meeting on Tuesday, accused the US of applying a \u201cmaximum pressure policy\u201d against Iran, a reference to a harsh US sanctions regime and military deployments to the Middle East. \u201cPresident Putin has said repeatedly that he could not understand the maximum pressure policy,\u201d Peskov told journalists on Tuesday morning. Tensions with Iran are the latest crisis troubling the US-Russia relationship, which was severely disrupted by accusations of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential elections. Pompeo and Putin are expected to discuss issues from nuclear arms control to the recent unrest in Venezuela, where Russia backs the government of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and the US backs opposition leaders. Pompeo arrived in the Black Sea resort of Sochi on Tuesday afternoon, telling the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov: \u201cI am here today because President Trump is committed to improving this relationship.\u201d Read further: UPDATE: Judge Mehta said he would not rule today, as this blog block originally reported. See our update here. Original text of block follows: On one side, the Democratic majority in the House of Representatives demands documents from Donald Trump and aides: tax records, business documents, emails, legal opinions. The constitution prescribes that Congress oversee the other two branches of government and subpoenas are a favorite tool. On the other side, Trump responds: No. Some analysts call it a constitutional crisis unfolding in real time; others say we\u2019re not there until a court issues an order which Trump then actually defies. But in a little more than an hour [Update: the ruling has been delayed] we could have a major development in one of the big Trump-House standoffs. The House Oversight and Reform Committee has subpoenaed one of Trump\u2019s accounting firms, Mazars USA, for eight years of Trump\u2019s financial records. The president sued to stop the release of the records. And at 11am judge Amit Mehta in the Washington DC district will convene a hearing about whether the records must be turned over. While it\u2019s not known how Mehta will rule, the judge earlier denied a Trump request to slow-walk the case, in a move taken not to be a good sign for Trump. On the subject of markets \u2013 the Dow Jones Industrial Average has opened up slightly, a half a point in the green on the day so far. It fell a bit more than three points on Monday. Donald Trump spent at least an hour and some 1,400 characters on Tuesday morning tweeting a defense of his tariffs on Chinese goods, which China has responded to with retaliatory tariffs, precipitating a dive on Monday in the US markets. Asian markets fell less sharply and European markets opened Tuesday slightly up. Trump said on Tuesday that \u201cTariffs have rebuilt our Steel Industry - it is booming!\u201d, \u201cwe are in a fantastic position\u201d, \u201cWe are in a much better position now than any deal we could have made\u201d and \u201cOther countries are already negotiating with us because they don\u2019t want this to happen to them.\u201d Companies from Apple to Boeing to Caterpillar have reason to disagree with Trump\u2019s rosy assessment, and economists warn that the retaliatory trade war just commenced could drive up costs for consumers. \u201cEnjoy!\u201d Trump concluded. Read further on Trump\u2019s tariffs: Hello and welcome to our daily politics coverage. US attorney general William Barr has put the power of the justice department behind a Donald Trump talking point by assigning a US attorney to examine the origins of an FBI investigation into Russia and the Trump campaign, according to the Associated Press. Barr told Congress in April that he believes \u201cspying did occur\u201d on Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, though he later said he didn\u2019t use the word with negative connotations. The appointment of a US attorney to investigate the investigation follows years of Trump and his supporters claiming the justice department and FBI spied on his campaign. Jim Baker, FBI general counsel at the time the Russia investigation was launched, pushed back forcefully on Friday against Trump\u2019s conspiracy theory. \u201c[The campaign probe] was about Russia. We\u2019ve written about this. It was about Russia, period, full stop,\u201d Baker said in an interview at the Brookings Institution. \u201cWhen the Papadopoulos information comes across our radar screen it\u2019s coming across in the sense we were always looking at Russia. I don\u2019t know how long the FBI had its focus on Russia, but it predates the Soviet Union...we have been thinking about Russia as a threat actor and the Soviet Union before for decades and decades.\u201d Relatedly, a Guardian exclusive revealed today that Steve Bannon, while serving as Trump\u2019 adviser in 2017, sought to ensure the FBI saw itself as an ally of the White House. Also today, the president travels to Louisiana this afternoon to make a speech about energy infrastructure and the economy. He\u2019ll stick around for a fundraiser before returning to Washington. Separately, we expect to hear from Senate leaders from both parties in press conferences this afternoon, as the legislature remains locked in a standoff with Trump over subpoenas for testimony and documents from Donald Trump Jr, attorney general William Barr, the former White House counsel Don McGahn and others.",

Oliver clarified that these ideas do not appear in the brief legislation: \u201cThe whole Green New Deal is just 14 pages long. That is seven pages shorter than the menu for the Cheesecake Factory.\u201d What the Green New Deal does do, however, is set out aggressive goals such as achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, meeting 100% of the country\u2019s power demand through renewable energy, and creating millions of new jobs. Conservatives have been attacking it because of jokes put forth in an early press release, a mistake acknowledged by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Even so, Oliver corrected the idea of where cow methane comes from: \u201cMost cow methane comes from them belching, not farting, and if you only remember one fact from tonight\u2019s show, please don\u2019t let it be that one.\u201d</p> <p>Although there are many solutions to the problem of climate change, Oliver chose to focus on carbon pricing to let his audience \u201cwatch the rerun of Game of Thrones, so that you can see what garbage from craft services they\u2019ve hidden as an Easter egg this week!\u201d The host tried to impress upon his audience the severity of carbon: \u201cThe current situation of carbon is critical. Carbon emissions are, by far, the largest source of greenhouse gases. Yet, right now, it\u2019s basically free to pollute the air with carbon dioxide \u2026\u201d He then noted this was strange: \u201cWe\u2019ve universally agreed that polluting is bad and yet, it\u2019s free to do it. When you litter, you pay a fine. When you drive above the speed limit, you pay a fine. When you steal 400 hamsters from PetSmart, tie them to a sled and race through the streets on a hamster sleigh, you pay a fine. Is that fine worth it? Of course it is! But you do pay it!\u201d</p> <p>Oliver the discussed two ways that carbon pricing could be introduced: cap and trade or carbon tax. For the latter, \u201cthe problem there is mostly the word tax which has become a dirty word in politics\u201d. He chose Canada\u2019s carbon tax rollout as an example, where the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, slipped and called it a tax to conservative boos from his parliament. \u201cIf you\u2019re a politician, you just can\u2019t say the word \u2018tax\u2019 in the same way that if you\u2019re an actor, you can\u2019t say the word \u2018Macbeth\u2019, and if you\u2019re president of the United States, you can\u2019t say the word \u2018origins\u2019,\u201d said Oliver, poking fun at Trump\u2019s difficulty with a simple word. In response to Trudeau\u2019s \u2018tax\u2019 slip-up, one Canadian conservative came forth with poetic rebuttal, in an attempt to repudiate the pricing, to which Oliver deadpanned: \u201cFire.\u201d \u201cLook, I don\u2019t care where you stand on this issue, no one wants to hear a rhyme about carbon taxes from anybody, let alone some guy who looks like he got his entire wardrobe from Express John Oliver.\u201d But he acknowledged the fight for carbon pricing was hard in Canada and in the United States, the last time it was on the table 10 years ago, Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia took a rifle bullet to the legislation in a video. \u201cThat may seem idiotic to you because it is,\u201d joked Oliver.</p> <p>\u201cThe Green New Deal has succeeded in getting people talking but that won\u2019t mean anything unless that talk now turns to actions and putting a price on carbon could potentially be one of them, although, let me reiterate it will not be enough on its own by a long shot.

It is a problem police and authorities in the US have been accused of ignoring.</p> <p>The river, over the decades, has come to be seen by many in the indigenous community as a dumping ground for discarded bodies, but their sense is that detectives don\u2019t take this seriously. Loved ones of the missing started to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/556842211083726//\">drag the Red</a> on their own starting in 2014 after finding Fontaine. That year, advocates say they pulled <a href=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2015/04/05/volunteers-to-dredge-red-river-again-to-find-missing-murdered-women.html\">seven bodies</a> from the river.</p> <p>Indigenous women in the United States and Canada are murdered, vanished or found dead without explanation at rates well above national per capita averages. Advocates on both sides of the border blame the crisis on a lack of specialized investigative policing as well as extreme gaps in government oversight.</p> <p>Others are more blunt and call the problem something else: racism, a discrimination breeding distrust in authorities among indigenous peoples. The discord suggests that whatever statistics are known are likely a disturbing undercount. Crimes are unreported and when they are, incidents often lack essential data and facts.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/01/essential-first-step-congress-moves-to-act-on-crisis-of-violence-against-native-women\">'Essential first step': Congress moves to act on crisis of violence against Native women</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But unlike Canada, the US lags behind in awareness and action to curb the injustice.

The nearly two-year investigation concluded in December. A report is expected to be released in <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/mmiwg-final-report-june-3-1.5092283?cmp=rss\">June</a>.</p> <p>It is unclear just how extensive the problem is in the US. A review of the FBI\u2019s 2017 violent crime report lists incidents that occur on tribal lands but does not tell anything about the gender or ethnicity of the victims.</p> <p>Statistics from the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/women/lcod/2015/native/index.htm\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> suggest that young Native American women are less likely than other women to be victims of homicide. Advocates argue that such statistics may reflect poor data collection, not less violence.</p> <p>The murder of LaFontaine-Greywind sparked a national outrage in America, and last year, a bill named after her became the first in Congress to propose increasing coordination among federal, state and tribal law enforcement to curb the chronic rate at which indigenous women go missing or are slain. However, passing Savanna\u2019s Act has been on an uneven path.</p> <p>In August 2017, during her last month of pregnancy, LaFontaine-Greywind, whose Dakota name is \u201cWhere Thunder Finds Her\u201d, placed a pizza delivery order to her family\u2019s Fargo apartment before heading upstairs to see a neighbor. It was the last time her parents would see their daughter alive.</p> <p>Kayakers found the Spirit Lake Nation woman eight days later. Her baby had been cut from her womb. Police had found the healthy newborn 72 hours earlier on the bed of her neighbor, Brooke Crews. The woman was arrested, <a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/06cb5aef22e3426ba16aff5b355dad1f\">pleaded guilty</a> and was sentenced to life without parole. Her live-in boyfriend, William Hoehn, was also <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/2170769/north-dakota-man-william-hoehn-gets-life-sentence\">sentenced to life</a> for conspiring to kidnap Savanna\u2019s baby, Haisley Jo.</p> <p>Justice was swiftly served in the aftermath of LaFontaine-Greywind\u2019s death, a rare outcome. So many other cases have turned cold.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/FargoPolice/status/900736141892227072\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Please RT.

With the clock ticking on her time in Washington, Heitkamp doubled-down on her signature legislation.</p> <p>Savanna\u2019s Act passed the Senate in the final days of the 115th Congress, but the bill was ultimately blocked by a single vote. The Republican congressman Bob Goodlatte of Virginia opposed certain provisions, which sent Heitkamp\u2019s proposal back to square one.</p> <p>Heitkamp, who prosecuted sexual assault cases as North Dakota\u2019s attorney general and whose mother was a survivor of sexual violence, told the Guardian the failure left her with \u201cheartache\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe could have gotten it done at the end of last year. We\u2019d be already, how many months into enforcement and implementation?\u201d Heitkamp said.</p> <p>The Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska reintroduced the bill in January. The proposed legislation would improve and increase access to data on Native American crime victims, establish police protocols and require annual reports to Congress on the number of missing and slain Native American women.</p> <p>Amendments made to Savanna\u2019s Act also expanded its reach to include non-reservation based communities after the Urban Indian Health Institute <a href=\"http://www.uihi.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Missing-and-Murdered-Indigenous-Women-and-Girls-Report.pdf\">pointed out that the bill was an incomplete solution</a> because it did not include urban women \u2013 such as LaFontaine-Greywind herself.

          "bodyText": "There was heartbreak across Indian country in August 2017 when the body of 22-year-old Savanna LaFontaine-Greywind was found duct-taped in plastic in the Red River. The ribbon of water demarcates North Dakota from Minnesota, a tributary flowing northward across the Canadian border. It is where, a few years earlier, an indigenous girl, 15-year-old Tina Fontaine, was discovered wrapped in a duvet cover and weighted down by rocks. The tales of these two tragedies and the river itself are emblematic of a modern violence against one of the world\u2019s most vulnerable populations, indigenous women and girls. It is a problem police and authorities in the US have been accused of ignoring. The river, over the decades, has come to be seen by many in the indigenous community as a dumping ground for discarded bodies, but their sense is that detectives don\u2019t take this seriously. Loved ones of the missing started to drag the Red on their own starting in 2014 after finding Fontaine. That year, advocates say they pulled seven bodies from the river. Indigenous women in the United States and Canada are murdered, vanished or found dead without explanation at rates well above national per capita averages. Advocates on both sides of the border blame the crisis on a lack of specialized investigative policing as well as extreme gaps in government oversight. Others are more blunt and call the problem something else: racism, a discrimination breeding distrust in authorities among indigenous peoples. The discord suggests that whatever statistics are known are likely a disturbing undercount. Crimes are unreported and when they are, incidents often lack essential data and facts. But unlike Canada, the US lags behind in awareness and action to curb the injustice. Fontaine, whose death is still unexplained, renewed calls by First Nations activists for a national inquiry into the broader issue \u2013 a cause the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, committed to in 2017. The nearly two-year investigation concluded in December. A report is expected to be released in June. It is unclear just how extensive the problem is in the US. A review of the FBI\u2019s 2017 violent crime report lists incidents that occur on tribal lands but does not tell anything about the gender or ethnicity of the victims. Statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggest that young Native American women are less likely than other women to be victims of homicide. Advocates argue that such statistics may reflect poor data collection, not less violence. The murder of LaFontaine-Greywind sparked a national outrage in America, and last year, a bill named after her became the first in Congress to propose increasing coordination among federal, state and tribal law enforcement to curb the chronic rate at which indigenous women go missing or are slain. However, passing Savanna\u2019s Act has been on an uneven path. In August 2017, during her last month of pregnancy, LaFontaine-Greywind, whose Dakota name is \u201cWhere Thunder Finds Her\u201d, placed a pizza delivery order to her family\u2019s Fargo apartment before heading upstairs to see a neighbor. It was the last time her parents would see their daughter alive. Kayakers found the Spirit Lake Nation woman eight days later. Her baby had been cut from her womb. Police had found the healthy newborn 72 hours earlier on the bed of her neighbor, Brooke Crews. The woman was arrested, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life without parole. Her live-in boyfriend, William Hoehn, was also sentenced to life for conspiring to kidnap Savanna\u2019s baby, Haisley Jo. Justice was swiftly served in the aftermath of LaFontaine-Greywind\u2019s death, a rare outcome. So many other cases have turned cold. Family and mourners felt the Fargo police department had reacted too slowly to her disappearance. The chief of police, David Todd, indicated that the investigation may have gone differently if the force knew they were looking for someone who had died. Tribal leaders across the state demanded reform. Dave Flute is the chairman of the Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate Nation and leads the United Tribes of North Dakota, a leadership coalition representative of the state\u2019s five-federally recognized tribal nations. \u201cDuring the gatherings and prayers for Savanna, we heard story after story from families who also have women in their families missing or with unsolved murders,\u201d said Flute in a letter addressed to North Dakota\u2019s congressional delegation in the weeks following LaFontaine-Greywind\u2019s death. \u201cThe murder of Savanna illustrates a much larger problem of epic proportions.\u201d In the letter sent on behalf of the tribes, leaders outlined 10-points of action for lawmakers to consider. Today, it serves as an aspirational checklist to gauge progress on the violence faced by indigenous women and girls. Heidi Heitkamp, the former senator of North Dakota, wasted little time responding to the checklist. \u201cFor too long, the disproportionate incidences of violence against Native women have gone unnoticed, unreported or underreported and it\u2019s time to address this issue head on,\u201d said Heitkamp on the day she introduced Savanna\u2019s Act on the Senate floor in Washington DC, just six weeks after LaFontaine-Greywind\u2019s body was pulled from the Red River. A year later in the run-up to the midterm elections in November 2018, Heitkamp was defeated by Kevin Cramer, North Dakota\u2019s sole congressional representative. With the clock ticking on her time in Washington, Heitkamp doubled-down on her signature legislation. Savanna\u2019s Act passed the Senate in the final days of the 115th Congress, but the bill was ultimately blocked by a single vote. The Republican congressman Bob Goodlatte of Virginia opposed certain provisions, which sent Heitkamp\u2019s proposal back to square one. Heitkamp, who prosecuted sexual assault cases as North Dakota\u2019s attorney general and whose mother was a survivor of sexual violence, told the Guardian the failure left her with \u201cheartache\u201d. \u201cWe could have gotten it done at the end of last year. We\u2019d be already, how many months into enforcement and implementation?\u201d Heitkamp said. The Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska reintroduced the bill in January. The proposed legislation would improve and increase access to data on Native American crime victims, establish police protocols and require annual reports to Congress on the number of missing and slain Native American women. Amendments made to Savanna\u2019s Act also expanded its reach to include non-reservation based communities after the Urban Indian Health Institute pointed out that the bill was an incomplete solution because it did not include urban women \u2013 such as LaFontaine-Greywind herself. Nearly three-quarters of Native Americans do not live on reservations but in cities and border towns across the US. Those expansions outlined in Savanna\u2019s Act would mean that police resources \u2013 including vital funding \u2013 would work to include collaborative efforts across jurisdictions but without an increase in appropriations, which had been a key reason for Goodlatte\u2019s objection, he said. Despite co-sponsoring Savanna\u2019s Act in January, Senator Cramer has also said he wanted changes made to the bill so it doesn\u2019t \u201cdisadvantage law enforcement agencies\u201d. Should passage of Savanna\u2019s Act meet challenges again, there are several other pieces of pending legislation at the federal and state level which address gender violence against indigenous women, including the recently introduced Not Invisible Act sponsored by Murkowski, a Republican, and Democratic senators Catherine Cortez Masto and Jon Tester. Like Savanna\u2019s Act, the Not Invisible bill goes a step further in calling for an advisory committee of local, tribal and federal stakeholders to examine best steps in stemming violent crime and human trafficking of Native women. The namesake of the bill was inspired by a celebrity-driven #NotInvisible social media campaign initiated by Heitkamp in 2017, although few advocates in Indian country have adopted the hashtag. \u201cDespite the narrative, it\u2019s still being shaped by those on the outside,\u201d said Abigail Echo-Hawk, the director of the Urban Indian Health Institute based in Seattle and a tribal citizen of the Pawnee Nation. But Echo-Hawk gives credit to congresswoman Deb Haaland of New Mexico \u2013 one of the first Native American women elected to Congress \u2013 for advocating for nuanced legislation more reflective of Indian country. In the days leading up to a House vote approving the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act earlier this month, Haaland was able to add language which would provide victim advocate services to urban Indians in the state courts. Indigenous political representation is a hopeful sign for advocates like Echo-Hawk who complain that policies impacting Indian country have for too long resulted in half-measured solutions. \u201cThe calls for various task forces to be set up and awareness days being implemented are great, but that\u2019s not enough,\u201d said Echo-Hawk. Like many advocates across Indian country who are invested in the \u201cmissing and murdered\u201d advocacy movement, there is a watchful gaze on Canada and the anticipated national inquiry report inspired in part by Tina Fontaine. Early indicators suggest poverty, unemployment and a lack of western education could be factors behind the violence, according to Marion Buller, the chief commissioner of Canada\u2019s National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls. \u201cWe\u2019re not seeing the inclusiveness the way we\u2019d like,\u201d said Echo-Hawk referring to the kind of policymaking addressing gender violence across the country. \u201cIt\u2019s time for real action and for real investment and we\u2019ll take nothing less than that.\u201d Jenni Monet\u2019s work is supported by The O\u2019Brien Fellowship in Public Service Journalism",

          "bodyText": "News footage showed people boating where they once walked, homes and cars filled with muddy water, volunteers searching for lost pets. Thousands of people in eastern Canada have been forced from their homes as heavy rains and meltwater cause unprecedented flood evacuations. One of the worst-hit areas was a Montreal suburb where more than 6,000 people were evacuated after a dike burst on Sunday. A further 3,000 people were evacuated in other parts of Quebec, and in Ontario and New Brunswick, hundreds more are waiting out the floods in hotels and shelters. \u201cThis year\u2019s flooding is very extreme,\u201d said Ursule Boyer-Villemaire, an associate professor at the Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al who specializes in disaster management and climate resilience planning. Climate change means that catastrophic flooding will only become more common, but experts say the events of the past week highlight the fact that Canada has still not done enough to prepare for such disasters. The current mass evacuations have forced Canadian politicians at every level to confront this dramatic evidence of climate change in a federal election year. Speaking on Sunday night, Justin Trudeau, the prime minister, suggested that using federal money to help relocate communities affected by flooding was a possibility. \u201cOnce we secure the situation through this spring flooding season, we will have to have significant reflections and conversations on how we move forward,\u201d he said, according to the Canadian Press. This is not the first time Quebec has seen large-scale flooding: in 2017, Quebec rivers reached similar levels. The fact that two so-called \u201chundred-year floods\u201d occurred so close together has climate preparedness experts concerned. Rapid temperature increases in spring and huge variation in the amount of precipitation, two factors in the flood, are related to climate change, said Laura Coristine, a biologist at the University of British Columbia. But Canada has done little to prepare for flooding that is likely to become even more common as the planet continues to warm, she said. \u201cResponding to disaster is going to be a lot more expensive than being proactive in vulnerable sites.\u201d Ontario\u2019s premier, Doug Ford, whose government has fought hard against the imposition of a country-wide carbon tax aimed at curbing emissions, toured flooded areas near the Ottawa River on Friday night. According to the Canadian Press, Ford did not explicitly mention climate change but did say \u201csomething is going on and we have to be conscious of it\u201d. Meanwhile, the leaders of Quebec and New Brunswick, the other affected provinces, are starting to talk about permanently relocating communities in flood-prone areas. That is not a simple thing to consider, said political scientist Daniel Henstra, an associate professor at the University of Waterloo who studies flooding in Canada: when a similar strategy was tried in Calgary after 2013 flooding, only 30% of homeowners in a high-risk flood area took the offered buyout so they could move. Currently, Quebec is offering residents C$200,000 (US$150,000) to move, but that may not even cover the mortgage for many. There are some other options, Henstra said, such as building flood barriers to keep the water in the river. \u201cThese types of barriers are really expensive to install and maintain,\u201d he said \u201cand they cause environmental impacts downstream.\u201d A more widely adopted strategy, globally speaking, is just to plan for flooding and keep people from building in flood plains.

Though the PQ lost both, separatism remains a going concern; nearly a quarter of Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois still consider themselves \u201csovereignists\u201d, according to a recent poll. Many among them still despise former prime minister Pierre Trudeau for his staunch anti-separatist stance, and have about as much regard for his son, the current prime minister, Justin Trudeau. \u201cBy blocking the democratically elected president of Catalonia, Canada is showing how it is hostile to Quebec\u2019s right of self-determination,\u201d said Maxime Laporte, president of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Saint-Jean-Baptiste, the pro-sovereignty group that invited Puigdemont to speak. \u201cIn Quebec\u2019s name, the Canadian government is telling us who is welcome and who isn\u2019t.\u201d In recent years, Quebec\u2019s independence movement has suffered the ravages of old age and apathy, but the travel ban prompted some to ask if the Canadian government had unwittingly helped the cause. \u201cIf they had just let him in, there would have been far less reaction,\u201d Handfield says. \u201cI think the government is now wishing it hadn\u2019t done this.\u201d Puigdemont was president of Catalonia from January 2016 to October 2017, but fled to Belgium after the Madrid government responded to his administration\u2019s declaration of independence by sacking him and taking control of the region. Other members of his government \u2013 including his vice-president, Oriol Junqueras \u2013 stayed behind and are now on trial at the supreme court in Madrid. In July last year, a Spanish judge dropped the international arrest warrants for Puigdemont and other fugitive members of his government. The dropping of the international warrant means Puigdemont and five former colleagues \u2013 currently in Belgium, Scotland and Switzerland \u2013 no longer face extradition proceedings. But domestic warrants remain in force, meaning the six will be arrested should they return to Spain. It emerged on Monday that Puigdemont and two of his former ministers are to be excluded from standing in next month\u2019s European elections after Spain\u2019s central electoral board upheld an appeal from two rightwing parties.",

Since the end of the war, the former British colony (then known as Ceylon) has been attempting to get back onto its feet, with some success.</p> \n  <p> The number of tourists was 448,000 in 2009 but has quadrupled to more than two million a year, reflecting diminishing safety concerns. </p> \n  <p> But tensions have remained between the different ethnic and religious groups that make up the 21.4 million people on the island. </p> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/may/18/tamil-tigers-killed-sri-lanka\"> The end of the war</a> came about as a result of a 2009 government offensive, believed to have killed up to 40,000 Tamils in the last few months alone. The government was made up of members of Sinhalese Buddhist majority who account for 70% of the population, while Tamils are mainly Hindu (13% of the island\u2019s inhabitants are Hindu). </p> \n  <p> In March, the UN human rights chief warned Sri Lanka could slip back into conflict unless it addressed the \u201cworst crimes\u201d during the final stages of the conflict.</p> \n  <p> Another problem has been the flare up of tensions between the Sinhalese majority and Muslims, who make up 10% of the population. </p> \n  <p> Last year, anti-Muslim violence flared across the hills of central Sri Lanka, fed by social media rumours about attacks on Buddhists. Mobs of Buddhists swept through small towns, attacking mosques and Muslim-owned shops. </p> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/06/sri-lanka-declares-state-of-emergency-after-communal-violence\"> The government briefly declared a state of emergency</a> and ordered popular social media networks to be temporarily blocked to prevent the violence from spreading.</p> \n  <p> Such recent conflagrations explains why, after Sunday\u2019s attacks, ministers were so keen to urge people to refrain from expressing sentiments that could cause \u201cracial disharmony\u201d and have once again shut down social media. </p> \n  <p> The British ruled Ceylon, previously controlled by the Dutch and Portuguese from 1815 until independence in 1948. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5cbc80a78f08d5e277b52106\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-04-21T14:44:44.834Z\">3.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here\u2019s the Guardian\u2019s story on the British casualties:</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/21/sri-lanka-bombings-british-citizens-among-dead\">Five British citizens killed in Sri Lankan bombings</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5cbc7dfb8f085bb0e0de5a18\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-04-21T14:33:52.535Z\">3.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Sri Lankan ministry of foreign affairs listed the known nationalities of foreigners killed as three from India, one from Portugal, two from Turkey, three from the UK and two holding US and UK nationality. </p> \n  <p>It said that there were a further 25 unidentified bodies believed to be foreigners at the Colombo judicial medical officer\u2019s mortuary. </p> \n  <p> Additionally, 19 foreign nationals are receiving treatment in hospital. </p> \n  <p>The emergency hotline to assist families of affected foreign nationals is +94 112323015. <br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-04-21T14:49:36.634Z\">at 3.49pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5cbc7d8d8f08c89bd9065a41\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-04-21T14:27:59.702Z\">3.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">At least five British citizens killed</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Sri Lankan ministry of foreign affairs says at least five British citizens (two who hold dual US and UK citizenship) were killed in the attacks.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5cbc78478f08d5e277b520a9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/benjamin-parkin\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-04-21T14:21:56.638Z\">3.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In the aftermath of a series of bomb attacks in Sri Lanka on Sunday, the government said it was blocking social media sites such as Facebook and Instagram until security forces completed their investigations.<br><br tabindex=\"-1\">The ability of misinformation online to stoke more violence has been high on Sri Lankan authorities\u2019 minds, with government ministers among those cautioning the public against apportioning blame for the attacks on social media.<br tabindex=\"-1\"><br tabindex=\"-1\">These concerns are more acute after <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/07/sri-lanka-blocks-social-media-as-deadly-violence-continues-buddhist-temple-anti-muslim-riots-kandy\">social media-fueled violence</a> spread around the country last year, said Sanjana Hattotuwa, a senior researcher at the Centre for Policy Alternatives, who studies social media in Sri Lanka.

Its roots reach back to the 18th century Dutch colonial period, when Catholicism was forbidden and priests would often hold services in secret. Local beliefs say the church\u2019s founder, disguised as a merchant, helped a seaside fishing community by praying to stop the sea from eroding their village. The church was later built near the site.</p> \n  <p><strong>St. Sebastian\u2019s church:</strong> This Catholic church is in Negombo, a largely Catholic town north of Colombo. Built in the Gothic style, it was patterned on Reims Cathedral in France and was completed in the 1940s.</p> \n  <p><strong>Zion church:</strong> This church is in the eastern coastal city of Batticaloa. It was founded in the 1970s.<br><br></p> \n  <h2>Hotels</h2> \n  <p><strong>The Shangri-La hotel:</strong> This towering, luxurious hotel is located near Colombo\u2019s main business district and is just a few steps from the sea. It has 500 guest rooms and suites and 41 serviced apartments.</p> \n  <p><strong>The Kingsbury Colombo hotel: </strong>This luxury hotel is located in Colombo\u2019s city centre, just a few minutes\u2019 walk from the Shangri-La. It has 229 rooms.</p> \n  <p><strong>The Cinnamon Grand Colombo hotel: </strong>This hotel is located about a mile (2km) from the Kingsbury and near the sea in a bustling business district.

Senaratne has also announced that the victims\u2019 families and the injured will receive government compensation. \u201cToday we have decided as a cabinet that we shall compensate all the people who died. 100,000 rupees for their funeral expenses,\u201d he said. The injured will also receive payments, and the bombed churches will be repaired with government funds. \u201cThis will start very soon,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are responsible, we are very sorry and we are doing our best to apologise to everybody.\u201d To recap: the health minister said authorities were warned two weeks before the attacks, and had the names of attackers, but this information was not shared with prime minister Wickremesinghe.

We were surprised to see these reports.\u201d \u201cWe do not believe these attacks were carried out by a group of people who were confined to this country. There was an international network without which these attacks could not have succeeded.\u201d National security and intelligence falls under the portfolio of president Maithripala Sirisena, and tensions between him and prime minister Wickremesinghe are high. In October last year, Sirisena attempted to sack Wickremesinghe as prime minster, triggering a constitutional crisis. \u201cThis is the only country where when the prime minister summons the security council they don\u2019t assemble,\u201d Seranatne said. \u201cDespite these revelations about security, we couldn\u2019t avert these attacks.\u201d \u201cWe are not trying to evade responsibility but these are the facts. We were surprised to see these reports.\u201d Sri Lankan cabinet spokesman, Rajitha Senaratne, is addressing media in Colombo. \u201cOn the 4th of April, 14 days before these incidents occurred we had been informed about these incidents,\u201d he says. Earlier, prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had said police had been warned at least ten days ago. \u201cOn the 9th of April, the chief of national intelligence wrote a letter and in this letter many of the names of the members of the terrorist organisation were written down,\u201d Senaratne said. \u201cThe prime minister was not informed by these letters and revelations\u201d. Earlier, Australia\u2019s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said they had not received any reports of any Australians killed. At 4.40pm in Melbourne, Morrison held a snap press conference to announce the government had received new information. \u201cWe have further information that has come through from our post, sadly two Australians have been killed as part of these terror attacks,\u201d he said. \u201c[They were] members of the same family. They were living in Sri Lanka at the time.\u201d Two other Australians were injured, Morrison said. One is a woman in her mid-50s and the other a woman in her mid-to-late-20s. Both are in a stable condition. One is being treated for shrapnel wounds, and one is being treated for a broken leg. Morrison said one of the deceased, and both injured women, were dual nationals. The two deceased were \u201cliving in Sri Lanka with their families\u201d, Morrison said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a terribly sad day\u201d. Australian prime minister Scott Morrison has told media that two Australians have died. Sri Lanka\u2019s foreign ministry has confirmed at least 37 foreign citizens are among the dead. Three Indian citizens, three British and two Turkish citizens were confirmed by the department, AFP reports. There are also 25 unidentified bodies \u201cbelieved to be of foreigners,\u201d the ministry said. The US state department has warned travellers to \u201cexercise increased caution\u201d in their latest travel advisory, saying \u201cterrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Sri Lanka.\u201d \u201cTerrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs [and] markets\u201d, it says. The UK foreign office says \u201cterrorists are likely to carry out attacks in Sri Lanka\u201d in their latest advice. The UN secretary-general has issued a statement of solidarity with Sri Lanka At least 290 people have been killed and 500 injured by a series of eight explosions targeting churches and hotels in Sri Lanka on Sunday night. 24 people have been arrested, and the defence minister Ruwan Wijewardene said the culprits were religious extremists, but no group has yet claimed responsibility. The prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, said security services had been \u201caware of information\u201d of a possible attack up to 10 days ago, and said the government \u201cmust look into why adequate precautions were not taken\u201d. Most of the dead are believed to have been Sri Lankans, but roughly 30 foreign citizen have been confirmed killed, including five Britons, three Indians and one Japanese citizen, and others. The government has shut down social media and messaging services to prevent the spread of misinformation. The coordinated attacks began with seven initial explosions \u2013 at four hotels and three churches \u2013 with another explosion later detonated while suspects fled from police. Defence minister Wijewardene said suicide bombers were responsible for the majority of the bombings World leaders including Narendra Modi, Imran Khan, Jacinda Ardern, Theresa May, Donald Tusk, Jean-Claude Juncker and Vladimir Putin condemned the attacks. Gunasekera declined to state which of the attacks on three churches and four hotels had proved the most deadly, and declined to give more detail about the 24 people now arrested. The number of arrests has also doubled, in the latest statement from police. Police spokesman Ruwan Gunasekera said 24 people had now been arrested in connection with the attacks, according to AFP. 290 people have been confirmed dead, according to police spokesman Ruwan Gunasekera. 500 people were also wounded, according to the figures provided to both Reuters and AFP. On Sunday night, the death toll was at 207. Late Sunday night, police spokesman Ruwan Gunasekara said a total of 13 suspects had now been arrested. A police source told AFP the 13 men were detained at two locations in and around Colombo, and that the suspects were all from the same radical group. No group has yet claimed direct responsibility for the attacks. Previously, police said eight had been arrested. In a statement, Gunasekara said police had seized a van and driver they suspected transported the suspects into Colombo and also raided a safe house used by the attackers. Three police officers were among the dead when the eighth suicide bomb blast went off during a police raid on a housing complex in Colombo during the hunt for the attackers. From earlier, some footage of the lines at Colombo airport during the overnight curfew An improvised explosive was defused last night near Colombo airport, police have confirmed. The bomb was discovered and made safe hours ago, late on Sunday night, but police this morning have provided further details. One source told AFP it was \u201ca homemade bomb\u201d. Airforce spokesperson Gihan Seneviratne said it was locally made, and described it as \u201ca crude six-foot pipe bomb that was found by the roadside\u201d. A Japanese national is among the people killed in Sunday\u2019s terrorist attacks, the government has confirmed. The victim, who has not been identified, is thought to have been a resident of Colombo and died in hospital after suffering serious injuries, the Kyodo news agency said. The Japanese government has sent officials to Sri Lanka to gather information about the victims. The foreign minister, Taro Kono, told reporters Monday that Japan had notified the Sri Lankan government of its readiness to help. In an earlier message to his Sri Lankan counterpart, Kono said: \u201cI would like to offer my prayers for the victims of the attacks, as well as my heartfelt condolences to the families of the deceased and my sympathies to the wounded.\u201d Kono voiced Japan\u2019s \u201csincere solidarity with Sri Lankan people\u201d, adding that it was \u201cfirmly committed to combating terrorism in cooperation with Sri Lanka and the international community\u201d. The Indian high commission in Sri Lanka has confirmed the names of two victims. As of last night, three Indian nationals were known to have died. One Japanese national has been confirmed killed, according to the Associated Press. At least four Japanese citizens were wounded. Chaos at airports, but buses and trains are back to normal now the curfew is over. Late last night, Sri Lanka\u2019s telecommunications minister, Harin Fernando, tweeted out photos of the memo from intelligence agencies \u2013 dated 11 April \u2013 warning of attacks. Australia\u2019s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has confirmed one Australian was injured. A statement said: \u201cDFAT has not received any reports of Australian fatalities. DFAT has offered consular assistance to one Australian injured in the attacks. \u201cAustralia stands in solidarity with the government and the people of Sri Lanka against these barbaric acts, and is ready to offer whatever assistance is required.\u201d Sri Lanka\u2019s countrywide curfew will be lifted in 15 minutes (6am local time). Authorities declared the curfew last night, imposing a ban on movement. One of the first victims to have been identified last night was Sri Lankan celebrity chef Shantha Mayadunne. Mayadunne and her daughter Nisanga had posted a photo online of their family having breakfast in the Shangri-La hotel shortly before the attack. Identification has been slowed by the government\u2019s social media shutdown, but of the foreign nationals, five Britons, three Indians, three Danes, two Turks and two Chinese nationals have been confirmed killed. Indian actor Radikaa Sarathkumar tweeted that she had narrowly escaped the attack, and had been in the Cinnamon Grand hotel moments before the blast. Sri Lanka\u2019s prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, said on Sunday night security services had been \u201caware of information\u201d of a possible attack. Local intelligence had received warnings 10 days ago that \u201cprominent churches\u201d could be the target of suicide bombers. \u201cWe must also look into why adequate precautions were not taken,\u201d Wickremesinghe told reporters on Sunday. Sri Lanka\u2019s security forces fall under the responsibility of President Maithripala Sirisena and tensions are high between the two leaders. In October last year, Sirisena attempted to sack Wickremesinghe as prime minster, triggering a constitutional crisis. Tulip Siddiq, the British Labour MP for Hampstead and Kilburn has tweeted that she lost a relative in yesterday\u2019s attacks. One Australian could be wounded, but none have been killed, according to the latest statement from Australia\u2019s trade minister, Simon Birmingham. He told ABC Radio National on Monday morning: \u201cWe are not aware of any Australian loss of life. I understand there may be an Australian injured but I\u2019m awaiting further details on that. \u201cOur heartfelt sympathies go out to the beautiful people of Sri Lanka for this terrible, terrible incident.\u201d A wave of bombings has rocked Sri Lanka on Easter Sunday. Here is what we know so far: At least 207 people have been killed and 450 more injured in a series of explosions targeting churches holding Easter services and hotels in Sri Lanka. Most of the dead are believed to have been Sri Lankans, but officials say about 30 people from other countries have lost their lives. Three UK nationals and two US-UK dual nationals were among the dead. One Dutch, one Chinese, one Portuguese and two Turkish nationals have been killed, their respective foreign ministries have confirmed. No one has claimed responsibility for the attacks but Sri Lanka\u2019s defence minister, Ruwan Wijewardene, said the culprits had been identified and were religious extremists. He said suicide bombers were responsible for the majority of the morning\u2019s bombings and that the wave of attacks was the work of a single group. Eight people have been reported to have been arrested so far. The government has imposed a curfew with immediate effect. It also shut down social media and messaging services. There were six initial blasts, at three hotels and three churches, before two more explosions some time later, at a guest house and housing scheme, with two people reported to have been killed at the former. Harsha de Silva, a government minister, said the last two blasts appeared to have been carried out by the culprits as they fled from police. The prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, condemned the \u201ccowardly\u201d attacks and urged people to remain \u201cunited and strong\u201d. He convened Sri Lanka\u2019s top military officials at an emergency meeting of the national security council. The archbishop of Colombo, Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, called it \u201ca very sad day\u201d and urged the government to identify the attackers and \u201cpunish them mercilessly because only animals can behave like that\u201d. World leaders including Narendra Modi, Imran Khan, Theresa May, Donald Tusk, Jean-Claude Juncker and Vladimir Putin condemned the attacks and expressed their sympathies to the victims. May called the violence \u201ctruly appalling\u201d and said that \u201cno one should ever have to practise their faith in fear\u201d. Our latest report is here: At least 207 people have been killed and 405 injured in a series of explosions, most of which believed to have resulted from suicide bombings which targeted churches and hotels in Sri Lanka. Most of those killed were locals but 36 foreigners are believed to have been killed following the attacks, which no group has yet claimed responsibility for although there have now reportedly been 13 arrests follow a police raid. The prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, acknowledged that \u201cinformation was there\u201d about the prospect of possible terrorist attacks, saying that investigations will take place into \u201cwhy adequate precautions were not taken\u201d while the government attempts to apprehend the perpetrators. There were six initial blasts, at three hotels and three churches, before two more explosions some time later. One was during the police raid and the other was at a guest house. The Sri Lankan government has imposed an indefinite curfew and shut down social media and messaging services amid fears over the spread of misinformation and the incitement of racial disharmony. This is what we know so far: There have been no reports of Canadian citizens having been affected by events in Sri Lanka, the country\u2019s prime minister Justin Trudeau has announced as he condemned the terrorist attacks I was shocked and saddened to hear of the devastating terrorist attacks in Sri Lanka, which have claimed the lives of more than two hundred people and injured many hundreds more. On behalf of the Government of Canada and all Canadians, I offer my heartfelt condolences to all those who have lost loved ones and my hope for a full recovery to those injured. Canada strongly condemns these heinous attacks on hotels and Christians at prayer in churches. Places of worship are sacred, where all should feel safe and secure. No one should be targeted because of their faith. For millions of people around the world, Easter is a time to reflect on Jesus\u2019 message of compassion and kindness\u2014a time to come together with friends and family. We cannot let attacks like these weaken the hope we share. To the people of Sri Lanka and other communities affected by today\u2019s attacks: Canada stands with you. We will continue to work with you and other international partners to combat terrorism and violent extremism and to promote greater peace and stability around the world. To date, we have no reports of any Canadian citizens being affected. Due to the current situation, our High Commission in Colombo will be closed on April 22. However, Canadians in need of emergency consular assistance should contact sos@international.gc.ca or call +1 613 996 8885. Real Madrid held a minute\u2019s silence before the kick-off of their game with Athletico Bilbao earlier today for the victims of the attacks. There have now been 13 people arrested in connection to the bombings, the BBC\u2019s Azzam Ameen has reported. The Foreign Office has confirmed that British nationals were among those killed. \u201cWe can confirm that British nationals were among those killed in today\u2019s horrific attacks in Sri Lanka,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cOur staff are supporting the relatives of the victims and are continuing to work with the relevant authorities to obtain further information. We extend our deepest condolences to those who have lost loved ones and all those affected by this senseless tragedy.\u201d We have more reaction from figures in the UK. The foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, called the attacks \u201chorrifying\u201d, saying \u201cto target those gathered for worship on Easter Sunday is particularly wicked\u201d. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said: \u201cI\u2019m appalled by the horrific attacks in Sri Lanka, on Easter Sunday, the most important day in the Christian calendar. I stand with the victims, their families, the people of Sri Lanka and Christians around the world. We must defeat this hatred with unity, love and respect.\u201d The archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, said: \u201cOn this holy day, let us stand with the people of Sri Lanka in prayer, condolence and solidarity as we reject all violence, all hatred and all division.\u201d The secretary general of the world\u2019s largest organisation of Muslim nations has condemned the Easter Sunday attacks that killed more than 200 people The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation\u2019s chief, Yousef al-Othaimeen, described them as \u201ccowardly attacks\u201d that targeted innocent worshippers and civilians. Fifty-seven nations are part of the OIC, which is headquartered in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia also denounced the six nearly simultaneous attacks and described them as \u201cterrorist explosions\u201d, saying the kingdom extended its condolences to the families of the victims and the people of Sri Lanka. Here is Facebook\u2019s statement in full, after Sri Lankan authorities blocked access to social media sites. \u201cOur hearts go out to the victims, their families and the community affected by this horrendous act. Teams from across Facebook have been working to support first responders and law enforcement as well as to identify and remove content which violates our standards,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cWe are aware of the government\u2019s statement regarding the temporary blocking of social media platforms. People rely on our services to communicate with their loved ones and we are committed to maintaining our services and helping the community and the country during this tragic time.\u201d After confirming eight arrests in relation to the bomb attacks, Wickremesinghe appealed for calm. The defence minister, Ruwan Wijewardene, has urged the media to refrain from publishing the names of the attackers, citing fears that it could inflame tensions between communities. The Sri Lankan foreign ministry has issued a further statement with more detail on the number of foreigners caught up in the attack. Eleven are confirmed dead, with nine reported missing, and 25 unidentified people believed to be foreigners remain at the Colombo judicial medical officer\u2019s mortuary. Nineteen foreign nationals have been hospitalised and are at Colombo\u2019s national hospital, according to the ministry. \u201cFollowing the explosions that took place in Colombo, Negombo and Batticaloa, earlier today, the number of foreign nationals who have been identified as deceased at the National hospital in Colombo stands at eleven,\u201d the statement read. Of the confirmed fatalities, three are Indian, three are from the UK, two hold US and UK nationalities, two are from Turkey and one is from Portugal. Denmark\u2019s foreign ministry has said three Danish citizens were also among those killed. My colleague Hannah Ellis-Peterson, the Guardian\u2019s south-east Asia correspondent, has this report on the blocking of social media sites in an effort to stop misinformation spreading. \u201cWe stand with the Sri Lankan government and people as they confront violent extremism,\u201d says the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, as he condemns the attacks and confirms several Americans are among those killed. The Sri Lankan foreign ministry earlier announced that two US-UK dual nationals are among the dead. It is not clear if by several, Pompeo is suggesting more than two American citizens have been killed. We now have more from Wickremesinghe\u2019s press conference. \u201cSo far the names that have come up are local,\u201d but investigators will look into whether the attackers had any \u201coverseas links\u201d, he told reporters. He also acknowledged that \u201cinformation was there\u201d about possible attacks. \u201cWhile this goes on we must also look into why adequate precautions were not taken.\u201d However, he stressed the government\u2019s first priority would be to \u201capprehend the terrorists.\u201d \u201cFirst and foremost we have to ensure that terrorism does not lift its head in Sri Lanka.\u201d The Sri Lankan prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, says that there was information circulating regarding a possible attack, but he was not privy to it and cabinet was not briefed. He added that adequate precautions were not taken to prevent the attack, and government will investigate why law enforcement authorities did not take precautions. Minister for national integration Mano Ganesan says officers were warned a week ago suicide bombers in Colombo could target politicians. Good afternoon, I\u2019m Mattha Busby, taking over from my colleague Haroon Siddique. Radikaa Sarathkumar, an Indian actor, said she was in the Cinnamon Grand hotel in Colombo moments before it was hit with a bomb attack. At least 207 people have been killed and 450 injured in a series of explosions targeting churches holding Easter services and hotels. Most of the explosions are believed to have resulted from suicide bombings. Most of the dead were locals but 36 foreigners are believed to have been killed. Five British citizens have been confirmed to have lost their lives (including two who also hold US citizenship), as well as three people from India, one from Portugal and two from Turkey. The Dutch foreign minister said one of the country\u2019s citizens was also killed. Britons were among the injured, the British high commissioner to Sri Lanka said. No one has claimed responsibility for the attacks but several arrests have been made and Sri Lanka\u2019s defence minister, Ruwan Wijewardene, said the culprits were religious extremists. He said seven people had been apprehended, while a police spokesman said three had been arrested with others questioned. The arrests were made as police raided a housing complex in in the Dematagoda neighbourhood of Colombo, three hours after the initial six blasts. Another blast occurred during the operation killing three police officers. The government imposed a curfew of indefinite duration and also shut down social media and messaging services. Schools will not reopen until Wednesday at the earliest. Before shutting down social media, government ministers urged people not to foster \u201cracial disharmony\u201d. In recent years, social media has been used in Sri Lanka to spread rumours about minorities, inciting violence. There were six initial blasts, at three hotels and three churches, before two more explosions some time later. One was during the police raid and the other was at a guest house. The prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, condemned the \u201ccowardly\u201d attacks and urged people to remain \u201cunited and strong\u201d. He convened Sri Lanka\u2018s top military officials at an emergency meeting of the national security council. The archbishop of Colombo, Cardinal Ranjith, called it \u201ca very sad day\u201d and urged the government to identify the attackers and \u201cpunish them mercilessly because only animals can behave like that\u201d. There has been condemnation of the attacks from around the world, including from Narendra Modi, Imran Khan, Theresa May and Donald Trump. May called the violence \u201ctruly appalling\u201d and said that \u201cno one should ever have to practise their faith in fear\u201d. Pope Francis denounced the \u201ccruel violence\u201d of the Easter Sunday attacks in Sri Lanka and said he would pray for all those affected. He added his condemnation at the end of his traditional Easter Sunday blessing in St Peter\u2019s Square. Barack Obama has denounced the attacks as \u201can attack on humanity\u201d. Here is some background on Sri Lanka\u2019s recent past: Sri Lanka\u2019s coastline of white sand beaches with crystal clear waters, coupled with its abundant flora and fauna can give it the appearance of an island paradise. But the country has a troubled recent past, emerging only 10 years ago from a bloody civil war that killed as many as 100,000 people. The conflict between government forces and separatist Tamil Tigers rebels raged for 26 years. Since the end of the war, the former British colony (then known as Ceylon) has been attempting to get back onto its feet, with some success. The number of tourists was 448,000 in 2009 but has quadrupled to more than two million a year, reflecting diminishing safety concerns. But tensions have remained between the different ethnic and religious groups that make up the 21.4 million people on the island. The end of the war came about as a result of a 2009 government offensive, believed to have killed up to 40,000 Tamils in the last few months alone. The government was made up of members of Sinhalese Buddhist majority who account for 70% of the population, while Tamils are mainly Hindu (13% of the island\u2019s inhabitants are Hindu). In March, the UN human rights chief warned Sri Lanka could slip back into conflict unless it addressed the \u201cworst crimes\u201d during the final stages of the conflict. Another problem has been the flare up of tensions between the Sinhalese majority and Muslims, who make up 10% of the population. Last year, anti-Muslim violence flared across the hills of central Sri Lanka, fed by social media rumours about attacks on Buddhists. Mobs of Buddhists swept through small towns, attacking mosques and Muslim-owned shops. The government briefly declared a state of emergency and ordered popular social media networks to be temporarily blocked to prevent the violence from spreading. Such recent conflagrations explains why, after Sunday\u2019s attacks, ministers were so keen to urge people to refrain from expressing sentiments that could cause \u201cracial disharmony\u201d and have once again shut down social media. The British ruled Ceylon, previously controlled by the Dutch and Portuguese from 1815 until independence in 1948. Here\u2019s the Guardian\u2019s story on the British casualties: The Sri Lankan ministry of foreign affairs listed the known nationalities of foreigners killed as three from India, one from Portugal, two from Turkey, three from the UK and two holding US and UK nationality. It said that there were a further 25 unidentified bodies believed to be foreigners at the Colombo judicial medical officer\u2019s mortuary. Additionally, 19 foreign nationals are receiving treatment in hospital. The emergency hotline to assist families of affected foreign nationals is +94 112323015. The Sri Lankan ministry of foreign affairs says at least five British citizens (two who hold dual US and UK citizenship) were killed in the attacks. In the aftermath of a series of bomb attacks in Sri Lanka on Sunday, the government said it was blocking social media sites such as Facebook and Instagram until security forces completed their investigations. The ability of misinformation online to stoke more violence has been high on Sri Lankan authorities\u2019 minds, with government ministers among those cautioning the public against apportioning blame for the attacks on social media. These concerns are more acute after social media-fueled violence spread around the country last year, said Sanjana Hattotuwa, a senior researcher at the Centre for Policy Alternatives, who studies social media in Sri Lanka. A social media blackout then had limited success in quelling the unrest, he said. Of the motives for the ban, he said: There\u2019s an abundance of caution. The effectiveness of course I can\u2019t say \u2026 The situation is fluid and very volatile. What we find is that communities are being targeted for the action of individuals. Given that it\u2019s now in the public domain that these were suicide bombings involved, a particular community is going to get targeted. A Sri Lankan news outlet reports that the driver of a van believed to have been used to transport bombs used in today\u2019s attacks has been apprehended. AP has some more details on the churches and hotels which were targeted in Sri Lanka: Churches St. Anthony\u2019s Shrine: This Roman Catholic church, located in the Kochchikade suburb of Sri Lanka\u2019s capital, Colombo, is one of the country\u2019s best-known churches. Its roots reach back to the 18th century Dutch colonial period, when Catholicism was forbidden and priests would often hold services in secret. Local beliefs say the church\u2019s founder, disguised as a merchant, helped a seaside fishing community by praying to stop the sea from eroding their village. The church was later built near the site. St. Sebastian\u2019s church: This Catholic church is in Negombo, a largely Catholic town north of Colombo. Built in the Gothic style, it was patterned on Reims Cathedral in France and was completed in the 1940s. Zion church: This church is in the eastern coastal city of Batticaloa. It was founded in the 1970s. Hotels The Shangri-La hotel: This towering, luxurious hotel is located near Colombo\u2019s main business district and is just a few steps from the sea. It has 500 guest rooms and suites and 41 serviced apartments. The Kingsbury Colombo hotel: This luxury hotel is located in Colombo\u2019s city centre, just a few minutes\u2019 walk from the Shangri-La. It has 229 rooms. The Cinnamon Grand Colombo hotel: This hotel is located about a mile (2km) from the Kingsbury and near the sea in a bustling business district. It has 483 rooms and 18 suites. A Sri Lankan news network reports at least eight nationalities among the foreign victims, citing a hospitals spokesperson. Two Turkish citizens were among the more than 200 people killed in bomb blasts at three churches and four hotels in Sri Lanka on Sunday, reports Reuters, citing Turkey\u2019s state media, Anadolu. Anadolu said the Turks were engineers working on a project in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka\u2019s minister of finance says that the country\u2019s different communities have been pulling together in the wake of the attacks. The British high commissioner to Sri Lanka has confirmed that Britons were among those caught up in the attacks. There is a suggestion there could be further casualties at the site of the Dematagoda raid, in which three police officers hunting the perpetrators of today\u2019s attacks were killed by an explosion and a number of people arrested. Police say they have arrested three people so far. The government put the figure at seven earlier but police say several others have been arrested but not questioned. They remain in the dark as to the perpetrators and their motive, they say. Stef Blok, the Dutch foreign minister, has confirmed that a Dutch national was among the fatalities in the Easter Sunday attacks. Meanwhile, the People\u2019s Daily in China has reported that one Chinese national died in the attack and four are in a stable condition in hospital after sustaining injuries. Portugal\u2019s ministry of foreign affairs said that one victim was a Portuguese citizen. The president\u2019s office has confirmed that Facebook, Instagram and other social media sites have been temporarily blocked in Sri Lanka, according to a state news portal, underlining that the blackout will continue as long as necessary for security forces to conclude their investigations into the attacks. It said the decision was prompted by the spread of misinformation on those sites. Just minutes after the government said the death toll had risen to 190, the police have said 207 people have been killed and 450 injured. The three police officers killed in Dematagoda (where the eighth explosion took place) died while raiding a block of flats in pursuit of the attackers, the government has said. The archbishop of Colombo has urged Sri Lankans not to \u201ctake the law into their own hands\u201d. The government said that the explosions appear to have been as a result of suicide bombings carried out by one group. The defence minister, Ruwan Wijewardene, says seven people have been arrested in connection with the attacks. He says at least 190 people have been killed, including 27 foreigners. (This post was amended as it was initially reported he said the death toll had risen to 160) Mahinda Rajapaksa, the leader of the Sri Lankan opposition and the country\u2019s former president, has called the attacks \u201cbarbaric\u201d, especially \u201con such a holy day\u201d. Mangala Samaraweera, the country\u2019s finance minister, said the attacks were an attempt to drag Sri Lanka back to the darkest days of its brutal civil war. He said the bombings were \u201ca diabolic attempt to create racial and religious tensions in this country yet again, thereby pulling the country backwards just as we as a country \u2013 economically, socially and otherwise \u2013 are recovering from the protracted war which destroyed the fabric of our nation for nearly 30 years\u201d. He continued: The bombings are not the doings of a fanatical individual. It\u2019s obviously a highly coordinated attempt to create murder, mayhem and anarchy in the country. Colombo\u2019s archbishop, Malcolm Ranjith, warned against vigilantism amid concern about heightened religious tension in the aftermath of the attack. The Sri Lankan government\u2019s official news portal says schools will remain closed until Wednesday and all police leave has been cancelled. Sri Lankan media also report that universities are closed and exams postponed. The BBC\u2019s Azzam Ameen says there have been police reports of some arrests \u2013 the first so far \u2013 in connection with the attacks. The president of the US has expressed his \u201cheartfelt condolences\u201d to the people of Sri Lanka, although, as so often with Donald Trump, his tweet will no doubt generate headlines for the typo it contains - a shame given today\u2019s terrible events. A Reuters journalist in Colombo says that three police officers were killed by the eighth explosion, at a block of flats in Dematagoda. The president of France, Emmanuel Macron, has condemned the \u201cheinous acts\u201d and offered solidarity to the Sri Lankan people. Sri Lankan Airlines has said passengers due to fly will be allowed to travel to the airport by security forces, provided they show their tickets and passports at checkpoints. Here are more images showing the aftermath of the deadly explosions: Pope Francis denounced the \u201ccruel violence\u201d of the Easter Sunday attacks in Sri Lanka and said he would pray for all those affected, AP reports. Francis added an appeal at the end of his traditional Easter Sunday blessing to address the massacre which killed more than 130 people. Speaking from the loggia of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, Francis said: \u201cI want to express my loving closeness to the Christian community, targeted while they were gathered in prayer, and all the victims of such cruel violence.\u201d He added: \u201cI entrust to the Lord all those who were tragically killed and pray for the injured and all those who are suffering as a result of this dramatic event.\u201d More European leaders have condemned the attacks and offered their sympathies to the victims. Those to have voiced solidarity include the European Council president, the president of the EU commission and the prime ministers of Finland and Denmark. Pope Francis offered prayers for the victims of the atrocities in Sri Lanka at the conclusion of his Easter speech, the BBC reported, although he did not mention the terrible events during his address. At least 138 people have been reported to be killed and hundreds more injured in a series of explosions targeting churches holding Easter services and hotels in Sri Lanka. AFP put the death toll at 156. Most of the dead are believed to have been locals, with the BBC putting the number of foreigners killed at nine, and AFP reporting that 35 people from other countries have lost their lives. The Guardian understands that British tourists are feared to be among those killed. No one has claimed responsibility for the attacks but Sri Lanka\u2019s defence minister, Ruwan Wijewardene, said the culprits had been identified and were religious extremists. An official told the Associated Press that two blasts were suspected to have been the work of suicide bombers. The government has imposed a curfew with immediate effect. It also shut down social media and messaging services. There were six initial blasts, at three hotels and three churches, before two more explosions some time later, at a guest house and housing scheme, with two people reported to have been killed at the former. Harsha de Silva, a government minister, said the last two blasts appeared to have been carried out by the culprits as they fled from police. The prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, condemned the \u201ccowardly\u201d attacks and urged people to remain \u201cunited and strong\u201d. He convened Sri Lanka\u2018s top military officials at an emergency meeting of the national security council. The archbishop of Colombo, Cardinal Ranjith, called it \u201ca very sad day\u201d and urged the government to identify the attackers and \u201cpunish them mercilessly because only animals can behave like that\u201d. World leaders including Narendra Modi, Imran Khan, Theresa May, Donald Tusk, Jean-Claude Juncker and Vladimir Putin condemned the attacks and expressed their sympathies to the victims. May called the violence \u201ctruly appalling\u201d and said that \u201cno one should ever have to practise their faith in fear\u201d. British tourists are feared to be among the foreign nationals killed in the Easter Sunday bombings across Sri Lanka, the Guardian understands. Tourism from the UK to Sri Lanka has surged in recent years, with more than 250,000 visits by British holidaymakers in 2018, according to the high commission in London. The embassy has set up an emergency hotline on 07917 382486 for families and friends concerned about a loved one in Sri Lanka. The UK Foreign Office has advised holidaymakers in Sri Lanka to get in contact with their families and family to let them know that they are safe. The latest travel advice to Sri Lanka can be found here. The curfew that was to have begun at 6pm has now been imposed with immediate effect. This map shows the locations of the eight blasts reported so far: Another Sri Lankan minister says the two latest attacks (number seven and eight), which occurred sometime after the initial six, appeared to have been carried out by the culprits as they fled from police. Sri Lanka\u2019s defence and military officials have decided to impose a curfew \u201cjust until things settle down,\u201d according to the state minister of defence, Ruwan Wijewardene, saying investigators have identified the culprits. He suggested the attacks, which he described as a \u201cterrorist\u201d incident, were the work of religious extremists. Wijewardene said: We have taken all the necessary precautions to keep this country safe and the people safe. We believe that all the culprits who have been involved in this unfortunate terrorist incident will be taken into custody as soon as possible. They have been identified, and they will be taken into custody as soon as possible. The advice for British citizens in Sri Lanka has been updated by the UK Foreign Office. It says: If you are in Sri Lanka, please follow the advice of local security authorities, hotel security staff or your tour company. You should avoid large gatherings. If you are in Sri Lanka and you are safe, we advise that you contact family and friends to let them know that you are safe. Sri Lankan Airlines has advised people to arrive at the airport early. This advice was issued before the curfew was announced, which will start in just under three hours. As well as announcing a curfew, the Sri Lankan government has shut down access to social media and messaging services, Reuters reports. As attacks continue, the Sri Lankan government is taking no chances and has imposed a curfew that will begin at 6pm and end at 6am tomorrow morning. It\u2019s just coming up to 3pm in Sri Lanka now so that gives people three hours to get home. The latest blast is reported to have been at a housing scheme. Media are reporting yet another blast. Sri Lanka\u2019s minister of economic reforms and public distribution, Harsha de Silva, has warned people against fomenting \u201cracial disharmony\u201d on social media. Meanwhile, the Muslim Council of Sri Lanka has mourned \u201cthe loss of innocent lives due to extremist and violent elements who wish to create divides between religious and ethnic groups\u201d. The UK prime minister, Theresa May, and the leader of the opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, have both condemned the attacks. The British high commissioner says he was at an Easter service that was cut short as a result of the blasts. The French embassy has told its citizens to avoid public places. By contrast to the other three hotels hit by explosions, which were all luxury establishments, the target of the latest explosion appears to have been a much more modest guesthouse. AFP is reporting two dead in the most recent explosion. Reuters is also reporting the explosion in Dehiwala, a suburb of Colombo, citing police. This is deeply worrying. A BBC reporter in Colombo is reporting a blast at another hotel. These photographs starkly illustrate the devastation wreaked by the attacks. The archbishop of Colombo, Cardinal Ranjith, said: It\u2019s a very very sad day for all of us. I wish therefore to express my deepest sorrow and sympathy to all of those innocent families who have lost someone and also to all those who have been injured and rendered destitute ... I condemn to the utmost of my capacity this act that has caused so much death and suffering to the people. He urged the government to identify the attackers and \u201cpunish them mercilessly because only animals can behave like that\u201d. The National Blood Bank has reportedly been overwhelmed by people wanting to donate. Azzam Ameen, a BBC reporter in Colombo, said a government minister told him \u201cthey have no clue\u201d who was behind the attacks and had no intelligence that such an attack was imminent. Ameen said that at present the country\u2019s intelligence agencies are just \u201cguessing\u201d that an international organisation or religious organisation could be behind it. He said rumours had been circulating about the prospect of further attacks and thousands of police had been deployed on to the streets of the country to stand guard. The respective prime ministers of India and Pakistan are among the world leaders who have condemned the attacks. Journalist Zahrah Imtiaz reports that people are flocking to give blood to help the injured. The AFP news agency is reporting that 156 people have been killed, including 35 foreigners, citing police sources. These images are of the Shangri-La hotel, one of three luxury hotels struck by the attackers. The speaker of the Sri Lankan parliament has condemned the attacks as striking at \u201cthe whole Sri Lankan nation, bound together by friendship and brotherhood\u201d. Pictures are emerging of the damage to the churches in Sri Lanka. Leaders have called for calm. Sri Lanka\u2019s president, Maithripala Sirisena, said in an address that he was shocked by the explosions and appealed for calm. The prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, wrote on Twitter: \u201cI strongly condemn the cowardly attacks on our people today. \u201cI call upon all Sri Lankans during this tragic time to remain united and strong. Please avoid propagating unverified reports and speculation. The government is taking immediate steps to contain this situation.\u201d News agencies are now reporting that more than 100 people have been killed in the church and hotel bombings. Police sources told AFP they believed the figure was 137. According to AFP, the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said at least 45 people had been killed in Colombo, where three hotels and a church were hit. Another 67 were killed in an attack on a church in Negombo, north of the capital, with a further 25 dead at a church in the town of Batticaloa, in the east of the country. It\u2019s still unclear what caused the blasts and there have so far been no claims of responsibility. The prime minister has met with senior military personnel. We are expecting an official statement on the incident to be issued soon. In the meantime, Harsha de Silva (minister quoted below) has called for calm and for people to \u201cact responsibly\u201d. Sri Lanka\u2019s minister of economic reforms and public distribution, Harsha de Silva, has visited the Kochchikade church and reports devastating scenes. Extensive damage to churches: Images of the damage are emerging on Twitter. This tweet is from Geeta Mohan, foreign affairs editor at India Today TV network. It\u2019s understood that the three churches hit by blasts are St Anthony\u2019s Church in the capital, St Sebastian\u2019s in Katuwapitiya, north of Colombo, and local media has also reported a church in Batticaloa in Eastern Province was hit. Reuters news agency is reporting that the three hotels hit in the capital Colombo, were the Shangri-La, Kingsbury Hotel and Cinnamon Grand. PM calls national security meeting: The Sri Lankan prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, has called a national security council meeting at his home later in the day. At least 50 people are now believed to have died in the church and hotel bombings. As the blasts took place in six different places, getting an accurate figure of casualties is challenging. A police official speaking to AFP believed at least 42 people were killed in the Colombo blasts. The Reuters news agency is saying more than 50 were killed in one of the church blasts outside the capital alone. We are waiting on official updates. The first explosions were reported at St Anthony\u2019s Shrine, a church in Colombo and St Sebastian\u2019s Church in the town of Negombo just outside the capital. It\u2019s believed dozens of people from the St Anthony\u2019s blast were taken to the Colombo National Hospital. Details of the blasts are still somewhat confused. An offical at the Cinnamon Grand Hotel near the prime minister\u2019s official residence in Colombo, told the news agency Agence France-Presse that a blast had ripped through the hotel restaurant, adding that one person had been killed. Dozens of people have died and hundreds have been injured in what is believed to be six separate explosions at churches and hotels in Sri Lanka. It\u2019s believed at least two of the hotels and one of the churches are in the capital, Colombo. Another church is in Negombo, north of Colombo. According to the Reuters news agency, Sri Lankan police are saying more than 50 people were killed in this blast.

You can\u2019t smell the product,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s too expensive.\u201d And so she, like tens of thousand of other Canadians, went back to their old habits: buying from neighbourhood dealers. Six months after Canada became the first G7 country to legalise marijuana, the bold experiment is still struggling to get off the ground. Legal producers were unable to meet the sudden surge in demand, and struggled for weeks to fill orders, leaving marijuana stores with empty shelves. As a result, the vast majority of cannabis sales in the country \u2013 roughly $5bn \u2013 are made on the illegal markets, compared to $2bn in legal sales, according to government figures from January 2019. Ahead of legalization, the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, had argued that the move would nearly eliminate the black market, which he said funnelled money into organized crime. But with so little cannabis to sell, licensed operators across the country have had to turn away potential customers, sending them instead to the black market. \u201cWhen I\u2019m sold out, they\u2019re still gonna find a product somewhere,\u201d said Trevor Tobin, who operates the High North marijuana store in Labrador with his mother, Brenda.

A number of government outlets and licensed private stores have also faced complaints that their products do not match the quality of the black market. \u201cThe product I got smelt like barn hay and was just as dry,\u201d wrote one user on the site WeedMaps, reviewing Toronto\u2019s first bricks-and-mortar locations, The Hunny Pot. \u201cThe only reason I\u2019ll go back is to get a refund for this purchase.\u201d Melissa agreed: \u201cI found it was really dry.

Canada is still grappling with how to treat people convicted under the country\u2019s previous laws.

Frankly not that many.\u201d Rankin also points to the uncomfortable reality of policing in Canada: visible minorities are over-represented in the number of minor cannabis convictions. \u201cThe disproportionate impact on the hundreds of thousands of Canadians \u2026 is something that really should motivate us to not just do the half measure the government\u2019s talked about, but fully expunge so people can get on with their lives,\u201d he said.

Running on a campaign slogan of \u201cAlberta: Strong and Free\u201d, winner Jason Kenney and his right-wing United Conservative party (UCP) pledged to revive the province\u2019s troubled oil and gas sector, cut taxes and scale back environmental policies enacted by the previous government.</p> <p>\u201cAlberta is open for business,\u201d Kenney told a raucous crowd, after pulling up to the stage of his victory celebration in his blue campaign pickup truck. \u201cHelp is on the way and hope is on the horizon.\u201d</p> <p>Premier Rachel Notley of the leftwing New Democratic party was vying for her second mandate in the province of Alberta, having previously shocked the country when she and her party stormed to victory in 2015. The historic win broke an unprecedented 44 years of conservative rule in the province and was heralded as a new age in Alberta politics.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/15/alberta-election-is-key-test-for-rachel-notley-and-canadas-carbon-tax\">Alberta election key test for Rachel Notley and carbon tax</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But a second time around, her promises of a balance between environmental regulation and businesses growth appears to have been rejected by a majority of Albertans, with frustrated residents defecting to the the UCP. Despite her strong favourability ratings, Notley becomes the first premier in the province\u2019s history to fail to secure a second term. </p> <p>She was the last remaining female premier in the country, a dramatic shift from 2013, when six women held the job in five provinces and one territory. \u201cI am enormously proud of our record \u2013 and you should be too,\u201d she told supporters as she conceded the race to Kenney \u2013 adding that she would remain as opposition leader. \u201cI wish him and his government well. We all do and we must because we all love Alberta.\u201d</p> <p>With Kenney\u2019s legislative majority, the province appears set to return to the status quo of conservative government.</p> <p>Loud cheers broke out in the Big Four Roadhouse, a venue in the Calgary Stampede grounds where UCP members had gathered. Provisional results at 11pm eastern (0400 GMT Wednesday), an hour after voting ended, showed the party had won 62 of the 87 seats in the provincial legislature.</p> <p>\u201cThis means vindication of the very, very difficult defeat that we received in 2015.

          "bodyText": "Conservatives in western Canada have won a critical regional election, with voters rejecting the province of Alberta\u2019s incumbent leftwing government and setting the stage for a fight with the federal government over environmental policy. The bitter election was fought largely over the economy, pipelines and the environment. Running on a campaign slogan of \u201cAlberta: Strong and Free\u201d, winner Jason Kenney and his right-wing United Conservative party (UCP) pledged to revive the province\u2019s troubled oil and gas sector, cut taxes and scale back environmental policies enacted by the previous government. \u201cAlberta is open for business,\u201d Kenney told a raucous crowd, after pulling up to the stage of his victory celebration in his blue campaign pickup truck. \u201cHelp is on the way and hope is on the horizon.\u201d Premier Rachel Notley of the leftwing New Democratic party was vying for her second mandate in the province of Alberta, having previously shocked the country when she and her party stormed to victory in 2015. The historic win broke an unprecedented 44 years of conservative rule in the province and was heralded as a new age in Alberta politics. But a second time around, her promises of a balance between environmental regulation and businesses growth appears to have been rejected by a majority of Albertans, with frustrated residents defecting to the the UCP. Despite her strong favourability ratings, Notley becomes the first premier in the province\u2019s history to fail to secure a second term. She was the last remaining female premier in the country, a dramatic shift from 2013, when six women held the job in five provinces and one territory. \u201cI am enormously proud of our record \u2013 and you should be too,\u201d she told supporters as she conceded the race to Kenney \u2013 adding that she would remain as opposition leader. \u201cI wish him and his government well. We all do and we must because we all love Alberta.\u201d With Kenney\u2019s legislative majority, the province appears set to return to the status quo of conservative government. Loud cheers broke out in the Big Four Roadhouse, a venue in the Calgary Stampede grounds where UCP members had gathered. Provisional results at 11pm eastern (0400 GMT Wednesday), an hour after voting ended, showed the party had won 62 of the 87 seats in the provincial legislature. \u201cThis means vindication of the very, very difficult defeat that we received in 2015. That was a protest vote, this is a positive vote,\u201d said Marguerite Denis, who co-managed the campaign of one UCP candidate. Much of the bitter campaign centred around pipelines, with both Notley and Kenney vowing to complete the Trans Mountain pipeline, a critical infrastructure project for the province that has languished in regulatory review since the summer. A prolonged energy crisis in the province \u2013 largely the result of overproduction of oil with no clear access to market \u2013 has forced energy companies to sell crude at deep discounts, costing thousands of jobs and billions in lost government tax revenues. While the majority of voters expressed frustration over the economic crisis in the province, they remained skeptical of the socially conservative positions taken by the UCP. Throughout the election Kenney\u2019s party was dogged by accusations of racism and homophobia, promoting candidate resignations and statements of contrition from others. Premier-designate Kenney will have to deliver on promises he made to revitalise the region\u2019s oil sands, something experts caution might be more difficult than anticipated given the high cost of production and a wariness of investing in capital-intensive projects. His victory is the latest in a string of conservative wins at the provincial level since 2015 and spells trouble at the national level for Justin Trudeau and his Liberal government, which has recently fallen in the polls after a political scandal and is locked in multiple legal battles with provinces over the federal carbon tax. Kenney has vowed to scale back the key aspects of the province\u2019s environmental legislation. But any changes to environmental policy that fall below Trudeau\u2019s emissions threshold will trigger the federal government imposition of a carbon tax on the province.",

          "bodyText": "When Canada\u2019s leftwing New Democratic party launched a manifesto promising carbon taxes, coal plant closures and welfare spending in the heartland of country\u2019s oil industry, few thought they could win. But in 2015, the party ended 40 years of conservative rule in the province of Alberta with an unexpected victory that seemed to mark a seismic shift in Canadian politics. Four years later, the NDP leader, Rachel Notley, is fighting for her political life in a regional election forcing voters to make a choice between today\u2019s economy or the environment of the future. Notley is asking voters to believe that both economy and environment can thrive. But her main rival, Jason Kenney, has seized on deep economic frustrations, promising that his United Conservative party will breathe new life into the ailing oil industry. In the years since Notley became premier, she has been forced to navigate a crash in global oil prices \u2013 which cost the province more than 100,000 jobs \u2013 and a huge forest fire, which became the costliest natural disaster in Canadian history. Meanwhile, her spending on childcare and social welfare programs have left the historically debt-averse province in the red. \u201cPeople like and respect Rachel Notley,\u201d said Shauna Wilton, a professor of political science at the University of Alberta. \u201cBut there\u2019s a segment of the population that blames her for the oil downturn and sees the carbon tax as the source of all of Alberta\u2019s problems.\u201d An ongoing energy crisis has forced Alberta to sell its crude oil for fire-sale prices. Pipelines that were promised to residents have yet to materialize. And resource companies \u2013 the backbone of the province\u2019s economy \u2013 are shedding jobs. And while voters have been sympathetic to the hand Notley was dealt, the dramatic slowdown has tested even the province\u2019s progressive residents. \u201cI\u2019m a social worker and a yogi. I\u2019m as left as they come,\u201d said Cheryl, a mother of two who lives in a small town near Calgary. \u201cAnd I\u2019m very likely voting for the United Conservative party.\u201d Recent polling has the New Democrats nearly ten percentage points behind United Conservatives, which was born from the 2017 merge of two regional right-of-centre parties. Kenney\u2019s pledge to boost investment in the oil industry resonates for many in the region, which has been hard hit by the oil downturn. \u201cThe rates of domestic violence skyrocket when people are not working,\u201d said Cheryl. But experts have questioned whether a return to the heyday of oil sands expansion is even possible, given the likelihood of a global shift to renewable energy in coming decades. \u201cWe should be diversifying our economy for the next time a downturn hits,\u201d said Mark Mielke, corporate lawyer in Calgary who plans to vote for the NDP, \u201cnot cutting taxes for corporations.\u201d The prospect of a conservative victory has also prompted worries that progress made on the environment under Notley will be rolled back \u2013 a fear compounded by a recent report that found Canada is warming at a rate twice the global average. Alberta \u2013 by far the largest polluter in the country \u2013 has been a critical ally for the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, and his government in their nationwide plan to fight climate change. But Alberta\u2019s cooperation came with a cost: in exchange for a carbon tax, Notley wanted promises of support for construction of the contentious TransMountain pipeline running from Alberta\u2019s oil sands to the Pacific coast. Despite the federal government going as far as buying the project, the pipeline remains unfinished and Notley has been forced to shoulder much of the blame. In an attempt to assuage local frustration, the premier has taken unprecedented steps to prop up oil prices \u2013 buying locomotives to ship crude by rail and enforcing rare production cuts for energy companies. There is some hope for environmentally conscious voters: attempts by Kenney to scale back the carbon tax would probably trigger a bitter fight with federal government, which has a minimum set of carbon emission standards a province must meet. Meanwhile, Kenney has come under criticism for his seeming inability to rid his party of extremist elements. Kenney\u2019s troubles became evident in a tense interview with the conservative radio host Charles Adler. As Adler ran through a list of offensive and racist behaviour from numerous UCP candidates \u2013 and even by Kenney himself, he asked the conservative leader: \u201cWhy are the knuckle-draggers attracted to your party?\u201d Several UCP candidates have withdrawn in recent weeks and others have been forced to walk back xenophobic and homophobic statements \u2013 including one who said homosexual love isn\u2019t \u201creal love\u201d and compared women who had have abortions to murderers. Such incidents, however, have done little to derail Kenney\u2019s prospects in rural areas of the province \u2013 and even in larger and more diverse cities. \u201cI think [voters] should assess whether an extra few hundred dollars in your pocket is really worth sacrificing what you truly believe is right,\u201d said Mielke. \u201cThis is a choice between a progressive plan to support our oil industry and diversify our economy \u2026 or a return to the sort of \u2018old boys\u2019 school of politics that\u2019s really ruled Alberta for the last 30 years.\u201d But for others, the choice is less clear \u2013 and less satisfying. \u201cThere\u2019s things from every party that everybody wants \u2013 and that\u2019s the pickle. Nobody aligns perfectly with any party,\u201d said Cheryl. She admitted that the socially conservative elements of Kenney\u2019s party are a \u201cconcern\u201d within her social circle, but concluded: \u201cYou have to choose your battles and what\u2019s most important to you or your family that day.\u201d",

          "body": "<p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you something,\u201d says Jacinda Ardern. We are sitting on sofas in her office on the ninth floor of the Beehive, the circular building that houses the New Zealand government in Wellington. It is just 10 days since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/17/new-zealand-attack-victims-of-the-mosque-massacre\" title=\"\">a terrorist attack in Christchurch took the lives of 50 people</a> at prayer. Outside, the flags are at half-mast. Two police officers stand by the glass doors, cradling semi-automatic weapons. Up on the ninth floor, the early morning sun scythes in through panoramic windows, the harbour just visible in the distance. In the reception area, a staffer\u2019s preschooler son buzzes back and forth on a bike.</p> <p>I have been asking Ardern about her immediate response to the attack, which from the outset put a clear emphasis on inclusivity and solidarity. Succinctly, steelily, the prime minister framed what had happened in her own terms. It felt very deliberate: was it?</p> <p>Not so much, Ardern says. \u201cVery little of what I have done has been deliberate. It\u2019s intuitive. I think it\u2019s just the nature of an event like this. There is very little time to sit and think in those terms. You just do what feels right.\u201d</p> <p>She crosses the office to her desk and pulls an A4 sheet of paper from a drawer. It\u2019s been folded in half, and in half again, and again. Printed on the back is the running order for an event she hosted in Auckland the night before the attack. On the front are a series of notes, scrawled in Ardern\u2019s rounded handwriting, growing more hurried and less legible as they cross the page. A handful of words have been highlighted in bright orange.</p> <p><em>One person custody may be other offndr.</em></p> <p><em>Act of exraordnry violence. It has no place in NZ.</em></p> <p><em>They are us.</em></p> <p>\u201cThese are my notes for the first press conference,\u201d she explains. \u201cI was in a hotel room. We only had a short amount of time to prepare.\u201d</p> <p>When the call came, Ardern was travelling in a minivan, sitting alongside the mayor of New Plymouth, a small city on the west coast of the North Island. That morning, Friday 15 March, she had surprised a crowd of local school students who were taking part in the global climate strike. \u201cWe hear you. We know we need to act,\u201d she had told them. Later, Ardern was due to officially open a music festival, but at that moment she was on her way to visit the site of a new school.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I absolutely knew what I wanted to say. That, very quickly, was clear to me when I heard that a mosque had been targeted</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe information was patchy and it was very difficult to decipher exactly what had happened,\u201d she recalls. \u201cWe didn\u2019t even know a confirmed toll. In an event like this \u2013 I can only assume, because I\u2019ve never been through one before \u2013 there\u2019s not a lot of time available to think about the language you want to use.</p> <p>\u201cI absolutely knew what I wanted to say. That, very quickly, was clear to me, when I heard that a mosque had been targeted. I knew what I wanted to say about that straight away. But, no, I didn\u2019t think about particular words. I just thought about sentiments, and what I thought needed to be conveyed.\u201d</p> <p>Ardern has been at pains to say that what happened on 15 March is not her story, but one that belongs to the victims and their families, to the injured, to Muslim communities, to Christchurch. If there are words that proved defining, they were those spoken by 71-year-old Haji-Daoud Nabi, who moments before being shot dead addressed the gunman from the door of Al Noor mosque, saying: \u201cHello, brother.\u201d</p> <p>And yet Ardern\u2019s response, her choice of language, has mattered enormously. In the hours after the attack, in which an Australian-born white-supremacist shot dead 50 unarmed people in two mosques, Ardern said that this was an act of terrorism. She pointedly refused to speak the name of the man who did it. (\u201cHe is a criminal. He is an extremist,\u201d she told parliament four days later. \u201cBut he will, when I speak, be nameless.\u201d) There was none of the bellicose, war-footing political rhetoric that so often stalks terrorist attacks. Gun law reforms, intended to ban all semi-automatic firearms, were expedited, with cross-party support. An inquiry was commissioned, tasked with asking, among other things, whether an emphasis on jihadi terrorism had meant New Zealand intelligence agencies were looking the wrong way.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d3b10666a697bcd178ce034ec7d1c1e297c863bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3b10666a697bcd178ce034ec7d1c1e297c863bc/0_270_4861_2970/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jacinda Ardern meeting Muslim community leaders following the Christchurch attack, at Parliament House in Wellington, 19 March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"611\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Meeting Muslim community leaders in Wellington following the attack.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Lintott/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The images were just as powerful. On Saturday 16 March, after another press conference in Wellington, Ardern flew south to Christchurch, where she met members of the Muslim community. \u201cI am here today to bring with me the grief of all New Zealand,\u201d she said. \u201cI am here to stand alongside you... We feel grief, we feel injustice, and we feel anger.\u201d She said it wearing a headscarf, an expression of solidarity that sprinted around the world.</p> <p>\u201cThe elements of that surprised me,\u201d says Ardern today. \u201cWhen I had the all-clear to go down on Saturday, I asked a friend if they had something for me to borrow. If I\u2019d been [at home] in Auckland it would have been different, but I didn\u2019t have scarves with me. So I asked if she had something I could borrow, because for me it was just a mark of respect. It was naturally what you would do. So, no, I didn\u2019t really think about that, either.\u201d</p> <p>Later, it was suggested to her that it was an important symbol of solidarity with Muslim women in New Zealand, who felt unsafe. \u201cI hadn\u2019t thought about it in those terms. It felt incredibly sad but completely obvious as well, that there would be those who would be worried. You know, the Muslim community was so obviously targeted, and they wear their faith so openly.\u201d</p> <p>There was no need to deliberate on her decision not to use the name of the terrorist, either: \u201cIt just seemed obvious to me.\u201d She had received no report, no advice reflecting the wealth of research that urges political leaders and the media to deny terrorists the notoriety they crave. She had, though, seen the shooter\u2019s manifesto, the 74-page screed he posted online. \u201cI haven\u2019t read it in full, but I saw enough of it to know part of what his aspirations were.\u201d</p> <p>Among the hideous novelties of the Christchurch attack is the fact that it was livestreamed, in bloody, dystopian detail, on Facebook, before metastasising across the internet, on sites where white supremacy festers, as well as on giant online platforms. Ardern took that on, too, in her parliamentary speech on 19 March, four days after the attack. \u201cThere is no question that [the] ideas and language of division and hate have existed for decades, but their form of distribution, the tools of organisation, they are new,\u201d she said. \u201cWe cannot simply sit back and accept that these platforms just exist and that what is said on them is not the responsibility of the place where they are published. They are the publisher. Not just the postman. There cannot be a case of all profit, no responsibility.\u201d</p> <p>What, then, does Facebook need to do?</p> <p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a New Zealand issue, this is a global one,\u201d says Ardern today, carefully choosing her words. \u201cReally, upholding the community standards that they\u2019ve set themselves, I think, is what people are asking for\u2026 We\u2019re asking for them to invest in ways to prevent the kind of harm we saw in the aftermath. And, let\u2019s be honest, in the lead up, too.\u201d</p> <p>Ardern sips from a mug of tea \u2013 though she confesses that, years after quitting, she\u2019s also drinking coffee again. Her partner, Clarke Gayford, she smiles, is not impressed. (Later in the day I contact Gayford, host of a television fishing show and father of the couple\u2019s nine-month-old daughter, Neve, asking for his official position on the prime minister having returned to coffee. \u201cWell, considering no night last week finished before midnight and some mornings started before five for her, I can understand,\u201d he replies. A staffer also tells me that Neve has been teething.)</p> <p>Ardern says she has been taken aback by the volume of press coverage over the past weeks, the scrutiny of her every word. \u201cThe conversations about it afterwards \u2013 I\u2019ve read these pieces where people have analysed the likes of this [speech],\u201d she says, waving the A4 sheet of notes in her hand, grimly laughing. \u201cThis was my first press conference. The second press conference I wrote on my phone on the way to Wellington.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>This interview was due to go to press the day the news of the Christchurch attacks emerged. By then, I had interviewed Ardern twice already: after a breakfast meeting at an Auckland hotel, and a few days earlier at Waitangi, on the northern tip of the North Island. Those interviews took place in early February, and I followed the prime minister as she commemorated the 1840 signing of New Zealand\u2019s founding treaty, between the British Crown and the M\u0101ori chiefs.</p> <p>That article told the story of a leader who was pledging to work harder to address the inequities still faced by New Zealand\u2019s indigenous people. It focused on her pledge to make 2019 a \u201cyear of delivery\u201d, and some signs that the halo of the Jacindamania that brought her to office had begun to dim. Pressure was mounting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/28/new-zealand-housing-crisis-just-47-affordable-homes-built-in-six-months\" title=\"\">over a failure to meet targets on a flagship house-building scheme</a>. A fight was brewing over the possible introduction of a capital gains tax. Ardern\u2019s Labour-led coalition government was under constant scrutiny: could she achieve the \u201ctransformational\u201d reform she\u2019d promised, when every change in the law meant scratching the backs of her coalition partners?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f8e898c92808e953f9baf7185097540d90e7795b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f8e898c92808e953f9baf7185097540d90e7795b/0_0_5687_3725/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand Prime Minister, photographed February, 2019.

But for the time being they feel like the concerns of another time, another galaxy. Ardern agrees. \u201cI was saying to someone the other day how long ago it feels since I was up north [at home]. It does feel as if the passage of time has extended.\u201d When I ask her which day last week a particular foreign dignitary spoke to her, she says, \u201cTime\u2019s a bit of a blur for me,\u201d with a sardonic laugh. It was \u201chalf a lifetime ago,\u201d she guesses. \u201cApproximately.\u201d</p> <p>Half a lifetime and seven weeks ago, I watched Ardern as she sat on the porch of Te Whare R\u016bnanga, the Maori meeting house at Waitangi. It was shortly after 11am and the speeches, from local elders, from politicians, echoed back and forth across the lawn.</p> <p>Ardern was grinning. She had just seen her partner return to his spot in the third row of plastic seating with Neve propped up on his knee, having just had a nappy change in the back seat of a car around the corner. The sun was beating down and Neve, in a blue bonnet and spotted dress, clucked away happily.</p> <p>\u201cI could hear her off to the side. She was being a little bit vocal,\u201d Ardern said when we met later that day, at the hotel down the road. A year earlier, she had become the first female prime minister to speak at the Waitangi p\u014dwhiri, a significant moment in the New Zealand calendar, and the youngest, at 37. Even in utero, Neve had made her presence known. \u201cShe used to kick me a lot, but I would especially notice when I came on to marae [a M\u0101ori meeting place], probably because of all the noise, the haka and performances. She would boot me a lot.\u201d</p> <p>Ardern began her speech that day by casting back a year, when she had \u201casked all of you to hold all of us, and myself, to account\u201d. She highlighted recent reforms to help disadvantaged M\u0101ori, to lift children out of poverty, most notably in the form of a \u201cfamilies package\u201d that boosted assistance to low- and middle-income families. \u201cWe have more to do,\u201d she said, words she would repeat throughout the day, \u201cbut I am an optimist. I was born one and politics has not beaten it out of me yet.\u201d A week ago, I asked her if the Christchurch attack had affected this optimism. \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cMy belief in the humanity of New Zealanders has strengthened. I just know we have a lot of work to do to make that universal.\u201d</p> <p>Optimism is baked into Ardern\u2019s character. At school, her mother once revealed, she convened a \u201chappy club\u201d. When she was made leader of the Labour party, with weeks to go before the 2017 election, the campaign was built around a self-described \u201crelentlessly positive\u201d outlook. And while Labour\u2019s manifesto remained essentially unchanged, people suddenly started to listen. \u201cLet\u2019s do this,\u201d went the slogan. Her opponents sneered that it was all just \u201cstardust\u201d, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/10/new-zealand-gripped-by-jacindamania-as-new-labour-leader-soars-in-polls\" title=\"\">the party surged on a wave of Jacindamania</a>.</p> <p>Many predicted that wave would crash on a grumpy rock in the shape of Winston Peters, whose nationalist NZ First (think a hosed-down version of Ukip) held the balance of power after the election. But Peters decided against backing the three-term incumbent National party. It was time to torpedo the status quo, he said, and at 72, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/24/new-zealand-kingmaker-winston-peters-deputy-prime-minister-foreign\" title=\"\">opted to become deputy to a thirtysomething prime minister</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6ff596aaf156d2088fdcfbef66f899a796baecc5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ff596aaf156d2088fdcfbef66f899a796baecc5/392_481_3314_4142/800.jpg\" alt=\"Jacinda Ardern\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018My belief in the humanity of New Zealanders has strengthened.

The news was announced via Instagram: Ardern, who still runs her own social media accounts, posted a photograph of fish hooks \u2013 two regular sized, one tiny \u2013 prompting copious media analysis. What did it mean? \u201cThe reality was that I went down into the shed, pulled out my fishing box and took out some hooks,\u201d Gayford told me earlier this year. \u201cI thought, yeah, that looks all right, that\u2019ll do.\u201d</p> <p>Ardern was already famous for her youth; the news that she was to become only <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/05/jacinda-ardern-will-work-up-until-she-goes-to-hospital-to-give-birth\" title=\"\">the second world leader to give birth in office</a> (after Benazir Bhutto 28 years earlier) went round the world. Here was a progressive upgrade on Canada\u2019s Justin Trudeau: an outward-looking young woman in a global lineup still dominated by greying men. At the UN in New York last September, Ardern made the case for action on climate change, and for \u201ckindness and empathy\u201d in politics \u2013 a message amplified by the fact her partner and baby daughter were sitting next to her. US Vogue dubbed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/15/the-anti-trump-new-zealand-pm-jacinda-ardern-vogue\" title=\"\">her \u201cthe anti-Trump\u201d</a>.</p> <p>As if becoming a mother and prime minister were not challenging enough, Ardern found herself hailed as a standard bearer for women everywhere. \u201cShe\u2019s not just leading a country,\u201d gushed Facebook\u2019s Sheryl Sandberg last year. \u201cShe\u2019s changing the game. And women and girls around the world will be the better for it.\u201d</p> <p>From a closer proximity, and speaking before the Christchurch attacks, Gayford told me that what he found most impressive was his partner\u2019s grip on the minutiae. \u201cIf you could see the amount of reading that is required in that role. It\u2019s 10, 11 o\u2019clock each night, going through cabinet papers. The level of detail that she has to absorb, and is able to retain, blows my mind. Last week I went half a day with my shirt inside out.\u201d</p> <p>For Ardern, Neve helps keep things in perspective. \u201cI occasionally go to events which may have quite a bit of profile and pressure around them. And then, within 15 minutes, I can be back in the hotel room having Neve spit pumpkin on my shoe. The worlds are in very close proximity. There\u2019s something very grounding about that. A lot of pumpkin. In the shoe.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>The prime minister was deep in conversation with her press secretary when she arrived for the formal part of our interview at Waitangi in February. \u201cWe\u2019re deciding whether I can get away with jandal-wear for the latter part of the afternoon,\u201d she confided. They resolved against the flip-flops, and settled on flats. It had just gone 2pm, and a wall of the meeting room was lit in horizontal lines, stencilled through Venetian blinds. The Guardian\u2019s photographer asked Ardern to stand in the stripes, a film-noirish sort of pose. \u201cMaybe with your sincerity, not your smile,\u201d suggested the photographer.</p> <p>\u201cI struggle not to smile,\u201d Ardern said through clenched teeth. \u201cI look like I\u2019m pouting. Terrible bone structure. It looks like a pout every time.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"91fc40fcb3f7aced7d205ad37d1e7e4ec06b034e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91fc40fcb3f7aced7d205ad37d1e7e4ec06b034e/1229_0_2880_3600/800.jpg\" alt=\"Jacinda Ardern comforts a mourner at Kilbirnie mosque in Wellington\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Comforting a mourner at Kilbirnie mosque in Wellington.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hagen Hopkins/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Towards the end of her Waitangi speech, she had quoted Michael Savage, the venerated Labour statesman who led the party to government for the first time in 1935: \u201cWe don\u2019t claim perfection, but what we do claim is a considerable advance on the past.\u201d It\u2019s a line that Ardern had rolled out in at least three big recent speeches, and felt, in part, like a plea to dial down the Jacindamania \u2013 a call to pragmatism.</p> <p>\u201cI am a pragmatic idealist,\u201d she told me. \u201cI will always strive for better. But I am pragmatic about how much time that sometimes takes.\u201d The optimism tends to win out. \u201cThe alternative option is that we come out and say, for instance, on child poverty, that we\u2019ve got these really minimalist targets. And have people say, \u2018Where\u2019s your ambition?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Under New Zealand\u2019s proportional system \u2013 in which people get two votes, one for their local politician and one for a party, as in Germany \u2013 a single-party majority is near impossible. This means Ardern must negotiate with both NZ First and the Green party to advance any legislation. But she says she enjoys this part of the job: \u201cI don\u2019t get exasperated or frustrated by it.\u201d Really? I found this hard to believe. \u201cOh, you know, sometimes you want things to be resolved a bit quicker, but I go in knowing I have to have those conversations. I\u2019m only in government because two parties decided to work with us.\u201d</p> <p>Ardern alighted on the benefits of New Zealand\u2019s system when I asked for her take on Brexit. The very mention prompted a grimace: \u201cThere are very few international political experiences quite like Brexit.\u201d But she wouldn\u2019t volunteer any advice for Theresa May, who at the time had narrowly survived a no-confidence motion. \u201cThe only thing I\u2019d say is that, as much as we inherited the Westminster system, we thankfully also have moved to an MMP [mixed-member proportional] system,\u201d she said. The system makes the sort of deadlocks witnessed in the Commons this year much less likely. \u201cWe have consensus really built into our system. It changes, probably more than we know, the way we work\u2026 By our very nature, I think we probably do things a bit differently.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>Jacinda Ardern grew up in the conservative, rural North Island town of Morrinsville. She was raised a Mormon, but quit the church in her early 20s, principally because of its stance on homosexuality. After completing a communications degree, she worked for a short stint in the Beehive of the last Labour prime minister, Helen Clark, who recalls noticing Ardern\u2019s promise when she was on a team drafting answers for parliamentary questions. (I spoke to Clark a few days after the Christchurch attack, and she told me Ardern\u2019s response had resonated because it was authentic. \u201cShe\u2019s not putting on an act. It\u2019s very genuine, and people warm to that. The critical thing has been the inclusive approach. To see people from across society, people who maybe have never even known anyone who goes to a mosque, come out with the flowers and the donations and say: this is not the New Zealand we know and love.\u201d)</p> <p>In 2008, Ardern was elected president of the International Union of Socialist Youth, a role that took her around the world. Earlier that decade, she lived for two and a half years in London, where she worked in Tony Blair\u2019s Cabinet Office. Blair was another Labour leader who came to office on a wave of progressive euphoria. I pointed this out when we met again in Auckland, and Ardern leaned back with a sigh, knowing where this was going. She worked only \u201cvery indirectly\u201d for Blair, she said. \u201cI never met him while I worked for him. Cabinet is a massive beast.\u201d Of the Blair years more broadly, she said: \u201cWhat you do with policy, it demonstrated to me, can be completely overshadowed by decisions in principle. You think of Tony Blair\u2019s period, now, and what do people talk about? The Iraq war. So for me, that means always having a mind on, yes, the policy work, yes, the domestic work \u2013 but actually what legacy do you leave through some of those bigger, overarching decisions as well?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6d87e509831f6c3cf7a2660b34f9e9fa53b405f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6d87e509831f6c3cf7a2660b34f9e9fa53b405f6/292_165_1873_1427/1000.jpg\" alt=\"New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern sits with her baby Neve before speaking at the Nelson Mandela Peace Summit during the 73rd United Nations General Assembly in New York, U.S., September 24, 2018.

And so I see that there was a weight of expectation there. But, otherwise, I don\u2019t tend to draw parallels.\u201d She paused. \u201cI\u2019ll just leave it there.\u201d</p> <p>But she didn\u2019t leave it there, picking up on a thread from our conversation in Waitangi earlier in the week. \u201cI think we were musing about this \u2013 the risk of ambition. Sometimes, what you\u2019re promoting isn\u2019t tangible. Sometimes, what you\u2019re promoting are things like wellbeing, these ambitious but intangible things.\u201d She doesn\u2019t want to lower the bar, to be someone who \u201conly has regard to political measures of success and says, \u2018Well, I\u2019m only going to set these ambitions, and talk in this way, because I don\u2019t want to be judged harshly for not having achieved them.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>When Ardern was made leader of the Labour party in 2017, she and Gayford were struggling to start a family. She put it frankly to me: \u201cI didn\u2019t know if I was going to be able to have kids.\u201d</p> <p>Then it all happened at once. \u201cNow I\u2019m finding out what every parent finds out: it\u2019s not about what\u2019s possible or what\u2019s not, it\u2019s about making it work. You just have to. There\u2019s no point at which you can say: \u2018I give up on being a parent\u2019 or \u2018I give up on doing this job.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>There is no nanny. Gayford is the primary caregiver and shuttles back and forth with Neve between their home in Auckland and Wellington. The couple\u2019s mothers are the main backup unit, especially when Gayford is away shooting Fish Of The Day, his fishing-travel-cooking hybrid show for the National Geographic channel. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to do it ourselves and with our family,\u201d said Ardern. \u201cThat may not always be the case, but for now we\u2019re making it work.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I said what I needed to say to Donald Trump. Whether or not I thought he would take it on board is another question</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As for being pronounced a \u201cgame changer\u201d for women, Ardern welcomed the idea she might inspire others, but was eager to present a truthful picture. \u201cI think people don\u2019t want us to be perfect,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m making an assumption here, but everyone knows that raising kids is hard work and I don\u2019t expect they\u2019d want someone to gloss over that or pretend it\u2019s easy. I can do what I do because I have help and I try to talk about that a lot.\u201d</p> <p>What about the \u201canti-Trump\u201d label, I asked her. \u201cIt still makes me laugh that Vogue came up with that,\u201d she said. But she is done with that kind of question. \u201cI would like to just do my job and be judged on being the prime minister of New Zealand,\u201d said Ardern. \u201cI get asked: \u2018Do you compare yourself to X or Y politician?\u2019 and I\u2019ll then get a string of male politicians from around the world \u2013 mostly, to be fair, because there aren\u2019t too many females. And my response to that? I wonder if they get asked the same question. \u2018Do you liken yourself to Jacinda Ardern?\u2019 And my bet is that no one would. So I actually think that, in New Zealand, we do things our own way.\u201d</p> <p>Following the Christchurch attacks, Ardern was asked at a press conference if she agreed with Trump\u2019s downplaying of the rise of white supremacy. \u201cNo,\u201d she said, bluntly. Trump had by then called to offer his condolences, and asked what he could do to help. Ardern\u2019s suggestion was that he could provide \u201csympathy and love for all Muslim communities\u201d. Within hours, Trump was doing the opposite, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/17/donald-trump-jeanine-pirro-fox-ilhan-omar-tucker-carlson\" title=\"\">throwing his weight behind a Fox News broadcaster</a> who had questioned the patriotism of a Muslim congresswoman, Ilhan Omar, because she wore a hijab.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4eec4b34252269df7ca83d851f2bc114a1e4df84\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4eec4b34252269df7ca83d851f2bc114a1e4df84/870_224_2147_1288/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jacinda Ardern at Buckingham Palace with the Queen, April 2017\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">At Buckingham Palace with the Queen in April 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Didn\u2019t that make her angry, I ask Ardern when we meet in Wellington. \u201cI said what I needed to say,\u201d she says, pausing and taking a slow, diplomatic breath of air, her hands clasped around her knees. \u201cWhether or not I thought he would necessarily take on board what I said, is another question. But I said what I needed to say.\u201d</p> <p>I try again. Wouldn\u2019t it be good if the president of the United States showed greater moral leadership? Ardern stares out the question for several seconds, grimacing. \u201cI think, as leaders, sometimes we\u2019re unaware of our reach and power,\u201d she says. \u201cSometimes I think we tend to think about our own actions in confined ways, and we underestimate the impact that we have. Yes.\u201d</p> <p>In the past weeks, New Zealand has reckoned with its own history. One Christchurch-based broadcaster issued an apology for an earlier column about Islam, saying, \u201cI look back at my comments ashamed.\u201d And in a powerful speech a week after the attack, Gamal Fouda, the imam of Al Noor mosque, where 42 worshippers were killed, <a href=\"https://thespinoff.co.nz/society/22-03-2019/hate-will-be-undone-and-love-will-redeem-us-imam-fouda-a-week-on/\" title=\"\">said the murders \u201cdid not come overnight\u201d</a>, but were \u201cthe result of the anti-Muslim rhetoric of some political leaders, media agencies and others\u201d.</p> <p>He may have had in mind Ardern\u2019s deputy Peters, whose NZ First has delivered dog whistles about immigrants and \u201cNew Zealand values\u201d for decades. Will she be speaking to him about his xenophobic rhetoric? She doesn\u2019t need to, she suggests. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s implicit now,\u201d she says. Following the attacks, she points out, it was Peters who decided to travel to Turkey for a meeting of the international Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, where he met Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan; the Turkish president had been screening images from the terrorist\u2019s video at rallies, and declaring that visitors from Australia and New Zealand who expressed anti-Islamic sentiments would be \u201creturned in coffins\u201d. \u201c[Peters] said \u2018I think we need to be there,\u2019\u201d says Ardern. \u201cThat was his instinct and it was the right one. He took our minister for ethnic communities with him, and made a powerful statement. So I think it\u2019s implicit for him now, too.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>A fortnight after the attack, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/29/jacinda-arderns-speech-at-christchurch-memorial-full-transcript\" title=\"\">national remembrance service is held at Hagley Park in Christchurch</a>, not far from Al Noor Mosque. Armed police are everywhere. Dozens of buses are parked sideways around the perimeter, forming makeshift ramparts. Bunches of flowers, handmade cards and soft toys line the footpath. Locals started leaving tributes here on 15 March; today they form a river, filling the pavement for 250 metres.</p> <p>Among the speakers this morning is 13-year-old Salma, who stands at the microphone and says, simply, of her father, Ashraf, who was killed: \u201cHe was a really nice man.\u201d Farid Ahmed\u2019s wife, Husna, was killed at Al Noor Mosque, too. He has forgiven the man who did it. \u201cI will forgive lavishly, because this heart doesn\u2019t want any more life to be lost,\u201d he tells the crowd.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bf176459a0d33eb2d4c95f717b76d3b8cb77bd68\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf176459a0d33eb2d4c95f717b76d3b8cb77bd68/165_18_2292_1375/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Talking to mourners after the national remembrance service in Christchurch on 29 March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Talking to mourners after the national remembrance service in Christchurch.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Baker/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The 50 names of the dead are read aloud, the only other sound the whirring of a police helicopter in the distance. A crescent moon hangs in the blue sky above.</p> <p>Ardern is wearing a traditional M\u0101ori cloak and, even before she begins speaking, is given a standing ovation. In the past her invocations of kindness might have been dismissed as slogans. Not today. \u201cWe each hold the power, in our words and in our actions, in our daily acts of kindness,\u201d she says. \u201cWe are not immune to the viruses of hate, of fear, of other. We never have been. But we can be the nation that discovers the cure.\u201d</p> <p>After the service I meet Tofazzal Alam, a Bangladesh-born New Zealander who was in the Linwood mosque when it was attacked. When the shooting began, he threw himself to the ground. He called his wife. \u201cI said, \u2018Can you please call 111. Someone is killing us.\u2019\u201d Ardern\u2019s words and actions have been \u201creally important for our community, and for people who have lost loved ones,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s made a huge difference.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>At Waitangi in early February, I had asked Ardern about the international attention she had attracted \u2013 for being young, for being a new mother. It just wasn\u2019t something she thought about, she said, hardly at all. Of course she needed to project New Zealand\u2019s voice, but her focus was on domestic priorities. Today, in the most appalling circumstances imaginable, she has the world\u2019s ear. What would she like to see other nations, other leaders, draw from New Zealand\u2019s experiences?</p> <p>\u201cHumanity. That\u2019s it. Simple,\u201d she says, nodding her head. \u201cPeople have remarked upon the way we\u2019ve responded, but to me there was no question. You need to remove some of the politics sometimes and just think about humanity. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Toby Manhire is the editor of New Zealand online magazine <a href=\"https://thespinoff.co.nz/category/politics/\" title=\"\">the Spinoff</a>.</p> <p>If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please fill in the form below.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"letters form\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;https://guardiannewsandmedia.formstack.com/forms/js.php/weekend_6_april&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://guardiannewsandmedia.formstack.com/forms/weekend_6_april&quot; title=&quot;Online Form&quot;&gt;Online Form - Weekend 6 April&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>",

          "bodyText": "\u201cI\u2019ll show you something,\u201d says Jacinda Ardern. We are sitting on sofas in her office on the ninth floor of the Beehive, the circular building that houses the New Zealand government in Wellington. It is just 10 days since a terrorist attack in Christchurch took the lives of 50 people at prayer. Outside, the flags are at half-mast. Two police officers stand by the glass doors, cradling semi-automatic weapons. Up on the ninth floor, the early morning sun scythes in through panoramic windows, the harbour just visible in the distance. In the reception area, a staffer\u2019s preschooler son buzzes back and forth on a bike. I have been asking Ardern about her immediate response to the attack, which from the outset put a clear emphasis on inclusivity and solidarity. Succinctly, steelily, the prime minister framed what had happened in her own terms. It felt very deliberate: was it? Not so much, Ardern says. \u201cVery little of what I have done has been deliberate. It\u2019s intuitive. I think it\u2019s just the nature of an event like this. There is very little time to sit and think in those terms. You just do what feels right.\u201d She crosses the office to her desk and pulls an A4 sheet of paper from a drawer. It\u2019s been folded in half, and in half again, and again. Printed on the back is the running order for an event she hosted in Auckland the night before the attack. On the front are a series of notes, scrawled in Ardern\u2019s rounded handwriting, growing more hurried and less legible as they cross the page. A handful of words have been highlighted in bright orange. One person custody may be other offndr. Act of exraordnry violence. It has no place in NZ. They are us. \u201cThese are my notes for the first press conference,\u201d she explains. \u201cI was in a hotel room. We only had a short amount of time to prepare.\u201d When the call came, Ardern was travelling in a minivan, sitting alongside the mayor of New Plymouth, a small city on the west coast of the North Island. That morning, Friday 15 March, she had surprised a crowd of local school students who were taking part in the global climate strike. \u201cWe hear you. We know we need to act,\u201d she had told them. Later, Ardern was due to officially open a music festival, but at that moment she was on her way to visit the site of a new school. \u201cThe information was patchy and it was very difficult to decipher exactly what had happened,\u201d she recalls. \u201cWe didn\u2019t even know a confirmed toll. In an event like this \u2013 I can only assume, because I\u2019ve never been through one before \u2013 there\u2019s not a lot of time available to think about the language you want to use. \u201cI absolutely knew what I wanted to say. That, very quickly, was clear to me, when I heard that a mosque had been targeted. I knew what I wanted to say about that straight away. But, no, I didn\u2019t think about particular words. I just thought about sentiments, and what I thought needed to be conveyed.\u201d Ardern has been at pains to say that what happened on 15 March is not her story, but one that belongs to the victims and their families, to the injured, to Muslim communities, to Christchurch. If there are words that proved defining, they were those spoken by 71-year-old Haji-Daoud Nabi, who moments before being shot dead addressed the gunman from the door of Al Noor mosque, saying: \u201cHello, brother.\u201d And yet Ardern\u2019s response, her choice of language, has mattered enormously. In the hours after the attack, in which an Australian-born white-supremacist shot dead 50 unarmed people in two mosques, Ardern said that this was an act of terrorism. She pointedly refused to speak the name of the man who did it. (\u201cHe is a criminal. He is an extremist,\u201d she told parliament four days later. \u201cBut he will, when I speak, be nameless.\u201d) There was none of the bellicose, war-footing political rhetoric that so often stalks terrorist attacks. Gun law reforms, intended to ban all semi-automatic firearms, were expedited, with cross-party support. An inquiry was commissioned, tasked with asking, among other things, whether an emphasis on jihadi terrorism had meant New Zealand intelligence agencies were looking the wrong way. The images were just as powerful. On Saturday 16 March, after another press conference in Wellington, Ardern flew south to Christchurch, where she met members of the Muslim community. \u201cI am here today to bring with me the grief of all New Zealand,\u201d she said. \u201cI am here to stand alongside you... We feel grief, we feel injustice, and we feel anger.\u201d She said it wearing a headscarf, an expression of solidarity that sprinted around the world. \u201cThe elements of that surprised me,\u201d says Ardern today. \u201cWhen I had the all-clear to go down on Saturday, I asked a friend if they had something for me to borrow. If I\u2019d been [at home] in Auckland it would have been different, but I didn\u2019t have scarves with me. So I asked if she had something I could borrow, because for me it was just a mark of respect. It was naturally what you would do. So, no, I didn\u2019t really think about that, either.\u201d Later, it was suggested to her that it was an important symbol of solidarity with Muslim women in New Zealand, who felt unsafe. \u201cI hadn\u2019t thought about it in those terms. It felt incredibly sad but completely obvious as well, that there would be those who would be worried. You know, the Muslim community was so obviously targeted, and they wear their faith so openly.\u201d There was no need to deliberate on her decision not to use the name of the terrorist, either: \u201cIt just seemed obvious to me.\u201d She had received no report, no advice reflecting the wealth of research that urges political leaders and the media to deny terrorists the notoriety they crave. She had, though, seen the shooter\u2019s manifesto, the 74-page screed he posted online. \u201cI haven\u2019t read it in full, but I saw enough of it to know part of what his aspirations were.\u201d Among the hideous novelties of the Christchurch attack is the fact that it was livestreamed, in bloody, dystopian detail, on Facebook, before metastasising across the internet, on sites where white supremacy festers, as well as on giant online platforms. Ardern took that on, too, in her parliamentary speech on 19 March, four days after the attack. \u201cThere is no question that [the] ideas and language of division and hate have existed for decades, but their form of distribution, the tools of organisation, they are new,\u201d she said. \u201cWe cannot simply sit back and accept that these platforms just exist and that what is said on them is not the responsibility of the place where they are published. They are the publisher. Not just the postman. There cannot be a case of all profit, no responsibility.\u201d What, then, does Facebook need to do? \u201cThis isn\u2019t a New Zealand issue, this is a global one,\u201d says Ardern today, carefully choosing her words. \u201cReally, upholding the community standards that they\u2019ve set themselves, I think, is what people are asking for\u2026 We\u2019re asking for them to invest in ways to prevent the kind of harm we saw in the aftermath. And, let\u2019s be honest, in the lead up, too.\u201d Ardern sips from a mug of tea \u2013 though she confesses that, years after quitting, she\u2019s also drinking coffee again. Her partner, Clarke Gayford, she smiles, is not impressed. (Later in the day I contact Gayford, host of a television fishing show and father of the couple\u2019s nine-month-old daughter, Neve, asking for his official position on the prime minister having returned to coffee. \u201cWell, considering no night last week finished before midnight and some mornings started before five for her, I can understand,\u201d he replies. A staffer also tells me that Neve has been teething.) Ardern says she has been taken aback by the volume of press coverage over the past weeks, the scrutiny of her every word. \u201cThe conversations about it afterwards \u2013 I\u2019ve read these pieces where people have analysed the likes of this [speech],\u201d she says, waving the A4 sheet of notes in her hand, grimly laughing. \u201cThis was my first press conference. The second press conference I wrote on my phone on the way to Wellington.\u201d *** This interview was due to go to press the day the news of the Christchurch attacks emerged. By then, I had interviewed Ardern twice already: after a breakfast meeting at an Auckland hotel, and a few days earlier at Waitangi, on the northern tip of the North Island. Those interviews took place in early February, and I followed the prime minister as she commemorated the 1840 signing of New Zealand\u2019s founding treaty, between the British Crown and the M\u0101ori chiefs. That article told the story of a leader who was pledging to work harder to address the inequities still faced by New Zealand\u2019s indigenous people. It focused on her pledge to make 2019 a \u201cyear of delivery\u201d, and some signs that the halo of the Jacindamania that brought her to office had begun to dim. Pressure was mounting over a failure to meet targets on a flagship house-building scheme. A fight was brewing over the possible introduction of a capital gains tax. Ardern\u2019s Labour-led coalition government was under constant scrutiny: could she achieve the \u201ctransformational\u201d reform she\u2019d promised, when every change in the law meant scratching the backs of her coalition partners? These prosaic-seeming challenges will resurface. But for the time being they feel like the concerns of another time, another galaxy. Ardern agrees. \u201cI was saying to someone the other day how long ago it feels since I was up north [at home]. It does feel as if the passage of time has extended.\u201d When I ask her which day last week a particular foreign dignitary spoke to her, she says, \u201cTime\u2019s a bit of a blur for me,\u201d with a sardonic laugh. It was \u201chalf a lifetime ago,\u201d she guesses. \u201cApproximately.\u201d Half a lifetime and seven weeks ago, I watched Ardern as she sat on the porch of Te Whare R\u016bnanga, the Maori meeting house at Waitangi. It was shortly after 11am and the speeches, from local elders, from politicians, echoed back and forth across the lawn. Ardern was grinning. She had just seen her partner return to his spot in the third row of plastic seating with Neve propped up on his knee, having just had a nappy change in the back seat of a car around the corner. The sun was beating down and Neve, in a blue bonnet and spotted dress, clucked away happily. \u201cI could hear her off to the side. She was being a little bit vocal,\u201d Ardern said when we met later that day, at the hotel down the road. A year earlier, she had become the first female prime minister to speak at the Waitangi p\u014dwhiri, a significant moment in the New Zealand calendar, and the youngest, at 37. Even in utero, Neve had made her presence known. \u201cShe used to kick me a lot, but I would especially notice when I came on to marae [a M\u0101ori meeting place], probably because of all the noise, the haka and performances. She would boot me a lot.\u201d Ardern began her speech that day by casting back a year, when she had \u201casked all of you to hold all of us, and myself, to account\u201d. She highlighted recent reforms to help disadvantaged M\u0101ori, to lift children out of poverty, most notably in the form of a \u201cfamilies package\u201d that boosted assistance to low- and middle-income families. \u201cWe have more to do,\u201d she said, words she would repeat throughout the day, \u201cbut I am an optimist. I was born one and politics has not beaten it out of me yet.\u201d A week ago, I asked her if the Christchurch attack had affected this optimism. \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cMy belief in the humanity of New Zealanders has strengthened. I just know we have a lot of work to do to make that universal.\u201d Optimism is baked into Ardern\u2019s character. At school, her mother once revealed, she convened a \u201chappy club\u201d. When she was made leader of the Labour party, with weeks to go before the 2017 election, the campaign was built around a self-described \u201crelentlessly positive\u201d outlook. And while Labour\u2019s manifesto remained essentially unchanged, people suddenly started to listen. \u201cLet\u2019s do this,\u201d went the slogan. Her opponents sneered that it was all just \u201cstardust\u201d, but the party surged on a wave of Jacindamania. Many predicted that wave would crash on a grumpy rock in the shape of Winston Peters, whose nationalist NZ First (think a hosed-down version of Ukip) held the balance of power after the election. But Peters decided against backing the three-term incumbent National party. It was time to torpedo the status quo, he said, and at 72, he opted to become deputy to a thirtysomething prime minister. Just a few months later it was revealed that the prime minister was pregnant. The news was announced via Instagram: Ardern, who still runs her own social media accounts, posted a photograph of fish hooks \u2013 two regular sized, one tiny \u2013 prompting copious media analysis. What did it mean? \u201cThe reality was that I went down into the shed, pulled out my fishing box and took out some hooks,\u201d Gayford told me earlier this year. \u201cI thought, yeah, that looks all right, that\u2019ll do.\u201d Ardern was already famous for her youth; the news that she was to become only the second world leader to give birth in office (after Benazir Bhutto 28 years earlier) went round the world. Here was a progressive upgrade on Canada\u2019s Justin Trudeau: an outward-looking young woman in a global lineup still dominated by greying men. At the UN in New York last September, Ardern made the case for action on climate change, and for \u201ckindness and empathy\u201d in politics \u2013 a message amplified by the fact her partner and baby daughter were sitting next to her. US Vogue dubbed her \u201cthe anti-Trump\u201d. As if becoming a mother and prime minister were not challenging enough, Ardern found herself hailed as a standard bearer for women everywhere. \u201cShe\u2019s not just leading a country,\u201d gushed Facebook\u2019s Sheryl Sandberg last year. \u201cShe\u2019s changing the game. And women and girls around the world will be the better for it.\u201d From a closer proximity, and speaking before the Christchurch attacks, Gayford told me that what he found most impressive was his partner\u2019s grip on the minutiae. \u201cIf you could see the amount of reading that is required in that role. It\u2019s 10, 11 o\u2019clock each night, going through cabinet papers. The level of detail that she has to absorb, and is able to retain, blows my mind. Last week I went half a day with my shirt inside out.\u201d For Ardern, Neve helps keep things in perspective. \u201cI occasionally go to events which may have quite a bit of profile and pressure around them. And then, within 15 minutes, I can be back in the hotel room having Neve spit pumpkin on my shoe. The worlds are in very close proximity. There\u2019s something very grounding about that. A lot of pumpkin. In the shoe.\u201d *** The prime minister was deep in conversation with her press secretary when she arrived for the formal part of our interview at Waitangi in February. \u201cWe\u2019re deciding whether I can get away with jandal-wear for the latter part of the afternoon,\u201d she confided. They resolved against the flip-flops, and settled on flats. It had just gone 2pm, and a wall of the meeting room was lit in horizontal lines, stencilled through Venetian blinds. The Guardian\u2019s photographer asked Ardern to stand in the stripes, a film-noirish sort of pose. \u201cMaybe with your sincerity, not your smile,\u201d suggested the photographer. \u201cI struggle not to smile,\u201d Ardern said through clenched teeth. \u201cI look like I\u2019m pouting. Terrible bone structure. It looks like a pout every time.\u201d Towards the end of her Waitangi speech, she had quoted Michael Savage, the venerated Labour statesman who led the party to government for the first time in 1935: \u201cWe don\u2019t claim perfection, but what we do claim is a considerable advance on the past.\u201d It\u2019s a line that Ardern had rolled out in at least three big recent speeches, and felt, in part, like a plea to dial down the Jacindamania \u2013 a call to pragmatism. \u201cI am a pragmatic idealist,\u201d she told me. \u201cI will always strive for better. But I am pragmatic about how much time that sometimes takes.\u201d The optimism tends to win out. \u201cThe alternative option is that we come out and say, for instance, on child poverty, that we\u2019ve got these really minimalist targets. And have people say, \u2018Where\u2019s your ambition?\u2019\u201d Under New Zealand\u2019s proportional system \u2013 in which people get two votes, one for their local politician and one for a party, as in Germany \u2013 a single-party majority is near impossible. This means Ardern must negotiate with both NZ First and the Green party to advance any legislation. But she says she enjoys this part of the job: \u201cI don\u2019t get exasperated or frustrated by it.\u201d Really? I found this hard to believe. \u201cOh, you know, sometimes you want things to be resolved a bit quicker, but I go in knowing I have to have those conversations. I\u2019m only in government because two parties decided to work with us.\u201d Ardern alighted on the benefits of New Zealand\u2019s system when I asked for her take on Brexit. The very mention prompted a grimace: \u201cThere are very few international political experiences quite like Brexit.\u201d But she wouldn\u2019t volunteer any advice for Theresa May, who at the time had narrowly survived a no-confidence motion. \u201cThe only thing I\u2019d say is that, as much as we inherited the Westminster system, we thankfully also have moved to an MMP [mixed-member proportional] system,\u201d she said. The system makes the sort of deadlocks witnessed in the Commons this year much less likely. \u201cWe have consensus really built into our system. It changes, probably more than we know, the way we work\u2026 By our very nature, I think we probably do things a bit differently.\u201d *** Jacinda Ardern grew up in the conservative, rural North Island town of Morrinsville. She was raised a Mormon, but quit the church in her early 20s, principally because of its stance on homosexuality. After completing a communications degree, she worked for a short stint in the Beehive of the last Labour prime minister, Helen Clark, who recalls noticing Ardern\u2019s promise when she was on a team drafting answers for parliamentary questions. (I spoke to Clark a few days after the Christchurch attack, and she told me Ardern\u2019s response had resonated because it was authentic. \u201cShe\u2019s not putting on an act. It\u2019s very genuine, and people warm to that. The critical thing has been the inclusive approach. To see people from across society, people who maybe have never even known anyone who goes to a mosque, come out with the flowers and the donations and say: this is not the New Zealand we know and love.\u201d) In 2008, Ardern was elected president of the International Union of Socialist Youth, a role that took her around the world. Earlier that decade, she lived for two and a half years in London, where she worked in Tony Blair\u2019s Cabinet Office. Blair was another Labour leader who came to office on a wave of progressive euphoria. I pointed this out when we met again in Auckland, and Ardern leaned back with a sigh, knowing where this was going. She worked only \u201cvery indirectly\u201d for Blair, she said. \u201cI never met him while I worked for him. Cabinet is a massive beast.\u201d Of the Blair years more broadly, she said: \u201cWhat you do with policy, it demonstrated to me, can be completely overshadowed by decisions in principle. You think of Tony Blair\u2019s period, now, and what do people talk about? The Iraq war. So for me, that means always having a mind on, yes, the policy work, yes, the domestic work \u2013 but actually what legacy do you leave through some of those bigger, overarching decisions as well? \u201cThere was a real sense of hope at the time Blair was elected,\u201d she continued, \u201cbecause people were ready for things to be done differently. And so I see that there was a weight of expectation there. But, otherwise, I don\u2019t tend to draw parallels.\u201d She paused. \u201cI\u2019ll just leave it there.\u201d But she didn\u2019t leave it there, picking up on a thread from our conversation in Waitangi earlier in the week. \u201cI think we were musing about this \u2013 the risk of ambition. Sometimes, what you\u2019re promoting isn\u2019t tangible. Sometimes, what you\u2019re promoting are things like wellbeing, these ambitious but intangible things.\u201d She doesn\u2019t want to lower the bar, to be someone who \u201conly has regard to political measures of success and says, \u2018Well, I\u2019m only going to set these ambitions, and talk in this way, because I don\u2019t want to be judged harshly for not having achieved them.\u2019\u201d *** When Ardern was made leader of the Labour party in 2017, she and Gayford were struggling to start a family. She put it frankly to me: \u201cI didn\u2019t know if I was going to be able to have kids.\u201d Then it all happened at once. \u201cNow I\u2019m finding out what every parent finds out: it\u2019s not about what\u2019s possible or what\u2019s not, it\u2019s about making it work. You just have to. There\u2019s no point at which you can say: \u2018I give up on being a parent\u2019 or \u2018I give up on doing this job.\u2019\u201d There is no nanny. Gayford is the primary caregiver and shuttles back and forth with Neve between their home in Auckland and Wellington. The couple\u2019s mothers are the main backup unit, especially when Gayford is away shooting Fish Of The Day, his fishing-travel-cooking hybrid show for the National Geographic channel. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to do it ourselves and with our family,\u201d said Ardern. \u201cThat may not always be the case, but for now we\u2019re making it work.\u201d As for being pronounced a \u201cgame changer\u201d for women, Ardern welcomed the idea she might inspire others, but was eager to present a truthful picture. \u201cI think people don\u2019t want us to be perfect,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m making an assumption here, but everyone knows that raising kids is hard work and I don\u2019t expect they\u2019d want someone to gloss over that or pretend it\u2019s easy. I can do what I do because I have help and I try to talk about that a lot.\u201d What about the \u201canti-Trump\u201d label, I asked her. \u201cIt still makes me laugh that Vogue came up with that,\u201d she said. But she is done with that kind of question. \u201cI would like to just do my job and be judged on being the prime minister of New Zealand,\u201d said Ardern. \u201cI get asked: \u2018Do you compare yourself to X or Y politician?\u2019 and I\u2019ll then get a string of male politicians from around the world \u2013 mostly, to be fair, because there aren\u2019t too many females. And my response to that? I wonder if they get asked the same question. \u2018Do you liken yourself to Jacinda Ardern?\u2019 And my bet is that no one would. So I actually think that, in New Zealand, we do things our own way.\u201d Following the Christchurch attacks, Ardern was asked at a press conference if she agreed with Trump\u2019s downplaying of the rise of white supremacy. \u201cNo,\u201d she said, bluntly. Trump had by then called to offer his condolences, and asked what he could do to help. Ardern\u2019s suggestion was that he could provide \u201csympathy and love for all Muslim communities\u201d. Within hours, Trump was doing the opposite, throwing his weight behind a Fox News broadcaster who had questioned the patriotism of a Muslim congresswoman, Ilhan Omar, because she wore a hijab. Didn\u2019t that make her angry, I ask Ardern when we meet in Wellington. \u201cI said what I needed to say,\u201d she says, pausing and taking a slow, diplomatic breath of air, her hands clasped around her knees. \u201cWhether or not I thought he would necessarily take on board what I said, is another question. But I said what I needed to say.\u201d I try again. Wouldn\u2019t it be good if the president of the United States showed greater moral leadership? Ardern stares out the question for several seconds, grimacing. \u201cI think, as leaders, sometimes we\u2019re unaware of our reach and power,\u201d she says. \u201cSometimes I think we tend to think about our own actions in confined ways, and we underestimate the impact that we have. Yes.\u201d In the past weeks, New Zealand has reckoned with its own history. One Christchurch-based broadcaster issued an apology for an earlier column about Islam, saying, \u201cI look back at my comments ashamed.\u201d And in a powerful speech a week after the attack, Gamal Fouda, the imam of Al Noor mosque, where 42 worshippers were killed, said the murders \u201cdid not come overnight\u201d, but were \u201cthe result of the anti-Muslim rhetoric of some political leaders, media agencies and others\u201d. He may have had in mind Ardern\u2019s deputy Peters, whose NZ First has delivered dog whistles about immigrants and \u201cNew Zealand values\u201d for decades. Will she be speaking to him about his xenophobic rhetoric? She doesn\u2019t need to, she suggests. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s implicit now,\u201d she says. Following the attacks, she points out, it was Peters who decided to travel to Turkey for a meeting of the international Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, where he met Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan; the Turkish president had been screening images from the terrorist\u2019s video at rallies, and declaring that visitors from Australia and New Zealand who expressed anti-Islamic sentiments would be \u201creturned in coffins\u201d. \u201c[Peters] said \u2018I think we need to be there,\u2019\u201d says Ardern. \u201cThat was his instinct and it was the right one. He took our minister for ethnic communities with him, and made a powerful statement. So I think it\u2019s implicit for him now, too.\u201d *** A fortnight after the attack, a national remembrance service is held at Hagley Park in Christchurch, not far from Al Noor Mosque. Armed police are everywhere. Dozens of buses are parked sideways around the perimeter, forming makeshift ramparts. Bunches of flowers, handmade cards and soft toys line the footpath. Locals started leaving tributes here on 15 March; today they form a river, filling the pavement for 250 metres. Among the speakers this morning is 13-year-old Salma, who stands at the microphone and says, simply, of her father, Ashraf, who was killed: \u201cHe was a really nice man.\u201d Farid Ahmed\u2019s wife, Husna, was killed at Al Noor Mosque, too. He has forgiven the man who did it. \u201cI will forgive lavishly, because this heart doesn\u2019t want any more life to be lost,\u201d he tells the crowd. The 50 names of the dead are read aloud, the only other sound the whirring of a police helicopter in the distance. A crescent moon hangs in the blue sky above. Ardern is wearing a traditional M\u0101ori cloak and, even before she begins speaking, is given a standing ovation. In the past her invocations of kindness might have been dismissed as slogans. Not today. \u201cWe each hold the power, in our words and in our actions, in our daily acts of kindness,\u201d she says. \u201cWe are not immune to the viruses of hate, of fear, of other. We never have been. But we can be the nation that discovers the cure.\u201d After the service I meet Tofazzal Alam, a Bangladesh-born New Zealander who was in the Linwood mosque when it was attacked. When the shooting began, he threw himself to the ground. He called his wife. \u201cI said, \u2018Can you please call 111. Someone is killing us.\u2019\u201d Ardern\u2019s words and actions have been \u201creally important for our community, and for people who have lost loved ones,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s made a huge difference.\u201d *** At Waitangi in early February, I had asked Ardern about the international attention she had attracted \u2013 for being young, for being a new mother. It just wasn\u2019t something she thought about, she said, hardly at all. Of course she needed to project New Zealand\u2019s voice, but her focus was on domestic priorities. Today, in the most appalling circumstances imaginable, she has the world\u2019s ear. What would she like to see other nations, other leaders, draw from New Zealand\u2019s experiences? \u201cHumanity. That\u2019s it. Simple,\u201d she says, nodding her head. \u201cPeople have remarked upon the way we\u2019ve responded, but to me there was no question. You need to remove some of the politics sometimes and just think about humanity. That\u2019s all.\u201d \u2022 Toby Manhire is the editor of New Zealand online magazine the Spinoff.

          "bodyText": "Justin Trudeau is facing fresh criticism for expelling two former ministers from his party, dashing any hopes that a scandal which has dogged his government for nearly two months will disappear any time soon. The scandal began with allegations of political interference with a corruption investigation, but it has now grown into an all-out crisis for the Liberal party, producing numerous political casualties and casting doubt over Trudeau\u2019s prospects in this autumn\u2019s general election. On Tuesday evening, Liberal MPs voted to eject former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould and former treasury board president Jane Philpott, citing a lack of confidence in the two women. \u201cThe trust that had previously existed between these two individuals and our team has been broken,\u201d Trudeau told reporters on Tuesday evening. But the expulsion of Wilson-Raybould, a Kwakwaka\u2019wakw lawyer and regional chief, and Philpott, a family doctor with extensive experience working in impoverished nations, threatens to tarnish the carefully crafted image of Trudeau and his government. When he first took power in 2015, Trudeau made a show of producing a gender-balanced cabinet \u201cthat looks like Canada\u201d \u2013 a position which some have now questioned after his decision to eject two rookie politicians widely viewed as rising stars. At an event promoting women\u2019s participation in politics on Wednesday, dozens of young women turned their backs on Trudeau as he addressed them in the parliament. Delegates also walked out of a speech by Conservative leader Andrew Scheer. Daughters of the Vote, the organization which organized the event, sent Trudeau a stark message: \u201cRespect the integrity of women and indigenous leaders in politics. Do better.\u201d Liberal MPs, however, saw the two women\u2019s continued presence was increasingly untenable after they both made high-profile criticisms of the prime minister. \u201cCivil wars within parties are incredibly damaging because they signal to Canadians that we care more about ourselves than we do about them,\u201d Trudeau said on Tuesday. \u201cOur political opponents win when Liberals are divided. We can\u2019t afford to make that mistake.\u201d The current scandal began when Wilson-Raybould alleged that the prime minister and his aides had pressured her to abandon the prosecution of an engineering company facing criminal charges for bribing Libyan officials. Montreal-based SNC Lavalin denies accusations of corruption and bribery to secure lucrative construction contracts. But in February, Wilson-Raybould testified that she came under pressure to reach a civil settlement with the firm. She said she resisted the pressure out of respect for constitutional norms \u2013 and a desire to shield the prime minister from accusations of impropriety. Trudeau has denied any wrongdoing, but has argued that action against SNC Lavalin could jeopardize thousands of jobs. Amid what she described as \u201cconstant and sustained\u201d pressure from Trudeau and his aides, Wilson-Raybould secretly recorded a phone call with the country\u2019s top bureaucrat \u2013 a step too far for the prime minister. \u201cIf a politician secretly records a conversation with anyone, it\u2019s wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen that cabinet minister is the attorney-general of Canada secretly recording the clerk of the privy council, it is unconscionable.\u201d Wilson-Raybould has defended taping the conversation, although she admits it was an \u201cextraordinary and otherwise inappropriate step\u201d. Philpott\u2019s undoing came after a bombshell magazine interview, in which she suggested there was more to the scandal that Canadians deserved to hear. The scandal \u2013 which already led the resignation of the former clerk of the privy council, Michael Wernick, and Trudeau\u2019s close adviser Gerald Butts \u2013 has also fractured relationships between Trudueau and indigenous Canadians. Wilson-Raybould was the first First Nations person to hold the position of attorney general and minister of justice, and her appointment stirred hopes that the government could make good on Trudeau\u2019s promise to renew Canada\u2019s relationship with aboriginal people. But as the scandal gained pace, Trudeau was forced to apologize for failing to condemn \u201csexist and racist\u201d slurs directed at his attorney general by anonymous party insiders. Indigenous leaders have unequivocally condemned Trudeau\u2019s handling of the crisis. \u201cHe\u2019s toast, absolutely toast,\u201d said Grand Chief Stewart Phillip, president of the Union of BC Indian Chiefs told Global News following news of Wilson-Raybould\u2019s expulsion. \u201cOnce again he has demonstrated his arrogance and did absolutely the worst thing he could possibly do. There\u2019s going to be an enormous backlash across the country in terms of indigenous people.\u201d While the government has announced a new budget and environmental policies, the scandal has sucked the air from the national debate and emboldened Trudeau\u2019s opponents. With an election just six months away, recently polling shows the Liberal party trailing the Conservatives by up to six percentage points. \u201cBy kicking Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott out of the caucus, the Liberals have sent Canadians a clear message: if you tell the truth, there is no room for you in the Liberal party of Canada,\u201d said the Conservatives\u2019 Scheer.",

          "body": "<p>\u2018It\u2019s a challenge out here. The way the tech companies are building and increasing their size is just pricing people out. Families who have been here for generations can\u2019t afford to be here any more. They\u2019re being pushed off into rural areas \u2013 anywhere from an hour to two and a half hours away.\u201d</p> <p>JT Faraji is a 43-year-old artist who lives with his family in East Palo Alto, the northern California city on the edge of Silicon Valley. Just a stone\u2019s throw away, Facebook\u2019s global headquarters is his most visible neighbour, and he is also close to a big new Amazon office. He has lived in the area all his life and talks volubly about fascinating aspects of East Palo Alto\u2019s history \u2013 like the period in the 1960s when black activists set up a high school and college, and there was even talk of renaming the city Nairobi: \u201cThere are a lot of minorities here: Hispanics, blacks, Pacific Islanders,\u201d he says. \u201cBut those people are <a href=\"https://www.techrepublic.com/article/5-eye-opening-statistics-about-minorities-in-tech/\" title=\"\">not really represented in the workforce in technology</a>. So the way that northern California is going to look in not too long is going to be very \u2026 <em>un</em><em>diverse</em>.\u201d</p> <p>In 2017, as part of a local grassroots group called the Real Community Coalition, Faraji began to <a href=\"https://paloaltoonline.com/news/2017/11/30/private-meeting-held-between-facebook-officials-and-east-palo-alto-advocates\" title=\"\">put pressure on Facebook</a> to \u2013 among other things \u2013 address concerns about housing and hire more local people. The coalition protested, organised vigils and eventually sat down with people from the company to discuss what was happening to their area. \u201cWhat mostly came out of that was a lot of hot air, pushing back,\u201d says Faraji. \u201cBasically stalling and stalling and stalling.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2185cc136bf67dc765775ec11c9e37de6237508a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2185cc136bf67dc765775ec11c9e37de6237508a/0_0_4817_2890/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Facebook\u2019s headquarters in East Palo Alto.

(In response to inquiries from the Guardian, Facebook acknowledged its work on local employment with a social enterprise called Year Up, which is dedicated to 18 to 24-year-olds, but also mentioned \u201ccommunity job fairs\u201d, efforts to connect \u201clocal residents directly to Facebook recruiters\u201d, and workshops on \u201cresume writing and interviewing skills\u201d). In late 2016, the company had also co-founded what it called the Catalyst Housing Fund, and contributed around $20m (\u00a315.3m), though Faraji says he has seen no signs of the money being spent; Facebook says that two and a half years after the fund was established, there are now plans for 261 new affordable housing units, but that \u201ctiming of project completion depends on the city\u2019s remaining approval processes for the projects\u201d.</p> <p>The Real Community Coalition has now fallen from view \u2013 partly, he says, because of the effects of Facebook donating to the very non-profit groups that have traditionally fought for local people: \u201cThey are usually the first line of defence, at least in our community: organisations that are trying to combat gentrification or fight for affordable housing or what have you. But now, some don\u2019t want to bite the hand that feeds them.

Leaving aside Amazon\u2019s globally ubiquitous fulfilment centres, they, Facebook and Google now have huge premises \u2013 \u201chubs\u201d, \u201ccampuses\u201d, old-fashioned offices \u2013 in cities across the planet, with even more to come.</p> <p>The change may have come too late for some of the people of East Palo Alto, but in the past two years or so, something has shifted. Now, as they are planned, proposed and built, these developments are increasingly being contested by coalitions of activists who follow each other\u2019s campaigns and draw on a growing pool of knowledge and experience.</p> <p>Because new big tech projects often arrive in areas beyond city centres, where property is comparatively cheap and many people from ethnic minorities have made their home, the campaigns against them are often led by people of colour. A big issue is the often cosy relationship between companies and politicians, who regularly do their best to push things along by sweetening planning agreements with tax breaks and generous grants. The issues proliferate: from the private takeover of public space, through basic questions of local democracy, to issues around work and pay. As cities endlessly expand and the power of tech corporations grows, if you want a sense of the future of grassroots politics, this is a very good place to look.</p> <p>The forces opposing big tech recently won a key victory in the New York borough of Queens, where Amazon\u2019s plans to locate a huge chunk of the corporate office project it calls HQ2 in Long Island City \u2013 where 25% of the population is African American and 40% Hispanic or Latino \u2013 were so fiercely contested <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/mar/23/the-grassroots-coalition-that-took-on-amazon-and-won\" title=\"\">that the company beat a hasty retreat</a>. In the midst of a somewhat absurd competition between US cities to attract Amazon to their locality, proposals had included <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/20/nyregion/amazon-nyc-cuomo-de-blasio.html\" title=\"\">a package of tax breaks and grants secretly negotiated</a> by the New York state governor Andrew Cuomo and the city\u2019s mayor Bill de Blasio <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6715559/Bill-Blasio-says-Alexandria-Ocasio-Cortez-wrong-tax-incentives-Amazon-deal.html\" title=\"\">that totalled nearly $3bn</a><strong>.</strong> It also raised the link between Amazon and the US\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.westword.com/news/colorado-bill-limiting-law-enforcement-cooperation-with-ice-moves-ahead-11290297\" title=\"\">Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency</a> (Ice). The agency uses Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services, and Amazon has tried to persuade its officials to use the company\u2019s face recognition software: a huge issue among many of the communities often on the receiving end of Ice\u2019s cruelties.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cfe10dedeb07b00dececb8641e0aa0fec031f92a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cfe10dedeb07b00dececb8641e0aa0fec031f92a/403_442_2597_1558/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I\u2019ve never run a campaign that only took four months\u2019 ...

The Amazon development was centred on 25,000 jobs that the company said would be paid an average salary of $150,000: many locals saw the prospect of a huge influx of white, wealthy outsiders, and loudly opposed it.</p> <p>A big voice in the campaign is <a href=\"https://commercialobserver.com/2019/01/the-loyal-opposition-to-amazons-long-island-city-deal/\" title=\"\">Maritza Silva-Farrell</a>, the executive director of the Alliance for A Greater New York (Align), a grassroots organisation addressing issues of inequality and the environment. When we speak, she is in Seattle, meeting politicians in Amazon\u2019s home city in the company of activists from Nashville, where Amazon is committed to a new \u201ccentre of excellence\u201d that will employ around 5,000 people. She says she has also regularly been in touch with people in Spain and Germany, where Amazon workers staged strikes about employment conditions last year: \u201cWe always speak about this campaign as a global campaign, because Amazon isn\u2019t a local corporation.\u201d</p> <p>Was she surprised that her side won? \u201cI\u2019ve never run a campaign that only took four months,\u201d she says. \u201cThe announcement came out in November and Amazon was out of the city by February. I\u2019m hoping it signals to other corporations that they can\u2019t come into town and say: \u2018We want this, and this, and this \u2013 and we\u2019ll create some jobs, but we\u2019ll tell you how many later.\u2019 You should come, and talk to our community, and see what the needs of the community are, and have a real plan of investment.\u201d</p> <p>Silva-Farrell is now having conversations with campaigners in and around Arlington, Virginia, where Amazon has plans to open <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2019/amazons-hq2-deal-with-arlington-county-gives-big-concessions-asks-little-of-the-company/\" title=\"\">what has ended up as the sole HQ2 complex</a>, on much the same scale as what it proposed for Queens. Its location is very close to Washington DC; the finished development will feature huge apartment blocks, a 49,000 sq ft cinema and \u201ca 23-storey luxury apartment complex with a private Whole Foods [supermarket] entrance\u201d. The development will be named National Landing, though it sits amid places that already exist: Pentagon City, Crystal City, and Potomac Yard \u2013 where, as in Queens, rising rents and impossible living costs are already highly charged issues.</p> <p>Every aspect of the Virginia story echoes what happened in New York. Amazon will receive \u201cperformance-based incentives\u201d totalling around $750m (\u00a3575m) from the state authorities if its plans come to fruition. With Arlington County\u2019s hotel tax revenue expected to rise with Amazon\u2019s arrival, the company will also get up to 15% of a local tax on hotels if it meets certain goals for how much space its new offices fill. In case anyone thought this wasn\u2019t quite generous enough, two weeks ago, county authorities in Arlington also approved a package of \u201cpay for performance\u201d grants to Amazon <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2019/amazons-hq2-deal-with-arlington-county-gives-big-concessions-asks-little-of-the-company/\" title=\"\">that could total $23m</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e7a4097e97ca3801398df9aecb74962e57ac616f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7a4097e97ca3801398df9aecb74962e57ac616f/0_233_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A young protester makes his point at an Arlington county board meeting discussing Amazon\u2019s development plans in the Virginia, city.

Photograph: Nandita Bose/Reuters</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nandita Bose/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The meeting where this happened was addressed by activists from a local coalition called For Us Not Amazon, whose leaders say that among the biggest issues they face is people\u2019s lack of awareness about Amazon\u2019s plans. <a href=\"https://www.fcnl.org/people/danny-cendejas\" title=\"\">Danny Cendejas</a> is an organiser with <a href=\"https://lacolectiva.org/\" title=\"\">La ColectiVA</a>, a grassroots organisation working among Virginia\u2019s Hispanic and Latino communities. What often hits him, he says, is an engagement gap made worse by the failure of both Amazon and the relevant local authorities to open up to people how their decisions will directly affect them \u2013 it is grimly symbolic, he says, that \u201con the county board\u2019s website, if you go to the link in Spanish and search \u2018Amazon\u2019, there\u2019s not a single hit that comes up\u201d.</p> <p>Like the Queens campaigners, Cendejas is appalled by Amazon\u2019s links to Ice and its work. Local officials and politicians, he says, ought to \u201cpublicly call on Amazon to end collaboration with that. They should be willing to be courageous and call on Amazon to do that, if Amazon want to be good neighbours.\u201d</p> <p>The other subject he talks about is the fragile state of communities threatened by rising rents and property prices. \u201cThe issue is here already,\u201d he says. \u201cIn this past year alone, from the conversations I\u2019ve been having with people, there\u2019s been an increase of around $200 [a month] in rent. For folks who are working paycheck to paycheck, that\u2019s a huge difference.</p> <p>\u201cAt least five of the families I\u2019ve been working with over the last six months have had to leave the area because of the cost of living. Amazon would exacerbate that, particularly as there have been no guarantees that people could carry on living where they live.\u201d The least that should happen, he says, is that the proposed giveaways to Amazon from public funds could be taken back, and invested \u201cin affordable housing, to be anti-displacement. That\u2019s an obvious idea.\u201d</p> <p>When I contact Amazon for its take on both its pull-out from Queens and opposition to its plans for Virginia, the company does not respond. Cendejas, by contrast, is very vocal about the threads that connect both stories. \u201cThe Queens win was a win for all communities of colour, and all low-income communities and all immigrant communities across the country. We celebrated with them. The concerns that people in Queens had were the same concerns we have here. And they\u2019re not being addressed.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"47e9125a6e7b8d0a9889241846c5228ff16ec7b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47e9125a6e7b8d0a9889241846c5228ff16ec7b1/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A banner protest against Google\u2019s plans to open a campus in the Kreuzberg area of Berlin.

In November 2016, Google announced that it was going to open a new \u201ccampus\u201d in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/nov/29/a-day-in-kreuzberg-berlin\" title=\"\">Kreuzberg</a> area of Berlin. Aimed at providing a space in which employees could mentor new tech startups, it was to occupy 3,000 sq ft in a disused electricity substation, located in the heart of one of the city\u2019s most renowned neighbourhoods.</p> <p>In the days of the cold war, Kreuzberg became a byword for West Berlin\u2019s Turkish population and bohemian subcultures: it was the one-time stamping ground of David Bowie and Nick Cave, and attracted thousands of punks and hippies avoiding West German national service. Twenty-seven years after the fall of the Berlin wall, it had become a noticeably more affluent area, but still retained enough of its old identity to convince Google it was a perfect place to be.</p> <p>In response to the company\u2019s announcement, the city authorities seemed exultant: \u201cToday is a good day for Berlin,\u201d said the city\u2019s mayor, Michael Muller. But the fact that Kreuzberg had held on to an enduring idea of its outsider status <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/may/09/fuck-off-google-the-berlin-neighbourhood-fighting-off-a-tech-giant-kreuzberg\" title=\"\">eventually proved to be Google\u2019s undoing</a>, thanks to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/world/europe/google-berlin-kreuzberg-campus.html\" title=\"\">a loose coalition of local activists</a> who were set on keeping it out. One of its elements was a group of techies elegantly named Fuck Off Google. Another was a neighbourhood organisation called <a href=\"https://www.bizim-kiez.de/en/blog/2019/02/15/amazon-pulls-out-of-planned-new-york-city-headquarters/\" title=\"\">Bizim Kiez</a>, meaning \u201cour quarter\u201d, whose activists had first come together to save a Turkish shop. A third was <a href=\"https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=de&amp;u=https://www.gloreiche.de/&amp;prev=search\" title=\"\">GloReiche</a> (a play on the German word for \u201cglorious\u201d), another neighbourhood collective that had recently worked to keep a bakery open.</p> <p>One of GloReiche\u2019s prime movers is Stefan Klein, a self-employed media law specialist who has lived in Kreuzberg for a decade: \u201cWe thought Google would be a tough opponent,\u201d he says. \u201cEverybody loves Google, everybody uses Google, Google is free, it has great products, and so on and so on. We thought: \u2018It will be difficult to tell people why we think this is a bad idea.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Very quickly, though, opinion began to turn. In the past five years, rents in Kreuzberg are reckoned to have gone up 30% \u2013 and there was widespread fear that Google\u2019s arrival would push them even higher. The fact that the new campus was intended to develop startups suggested to many Kreuzbergers that it would essentially amount to a gentrification factory, sending out swarms of new tech businesses to eventually take over the neighbourhood. And as Klein explains, there was also a fear of what the company\u2019s arrival would mean for deep issues about the area\u2019s infrastructure, alongside concerns about the opportunities that would arise for the company to harvest an ocean of information about people\u2019s lives on the basis of what was planned in Toronto (more of that below): \u201cWherever Google goes,\u201d he says, \u201cthey take over. They offer public services like transportation, or even controlling traffic lights \u2013 <em>everything</em>. For free, they say. But it\u2019s never for free: they always want data. That\u2019s the point.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5c3adf01c167c34654f991302b065309eeb91ec6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c3adf01c167c34654f991302b065309eeb91ec6/1291_0_2248_2592/867.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Wherever Google goes, they take over\u2019 ...

Kreuzberg campaigner Stefan Klein</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Throughout their campaign, the Kreuzberg activists were in contact with grassroots anti-Google campaigners in Toronto and the company\u2019s home city of San Francisco: comparing notes, pooling research and keeping in touch with each other\u2019s activities. And after months of street protest, meetings, and door-to-door canvassing, in late October 2018, Google announced that it was pulling its plans: it would retain its lease on the property in question, but for the next five years, the space would be used by two social enterprises.</p> <p>The company will not be directly quoted on its plans, but a Google spokesperson says he is confident the new arrangement will be \u201csomething for longer term\u201d. Klein remains sceptical: \u201cI think they\u2019re hoping that we\u2019re asleep, and we\u2019re not fighting any more, and they can move in easily,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re doing more actions again in May \u2013 telling people what is happening. Because they\u2019ve heard it from the press, most people think: \u2018Oh, they\u2019ve won, everything is fine.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>He suddenly sounds worried. \u201cWe don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p> <p>In Toronto, perhaps the most jaw-dropping story to date about big tech and the future of cities is rapidly taking shape. The city\u2019s waterfront is reckoned to be the largest area of undeveloped real estate in North America \u2013 which, under the supervision of a public body called <a href=\"https://www.waterfrontoronto.ca/nbe/portal/waterfront/Home\" title=\"\">Waterfront Toronto</a>, may soon be transformed. The company in charge will be <a href=\"https://www.sidewalklabs.com/\" title=\"\">Sidewalk Labs</a>, an offshoot of Google that \u201cimagines, designs, tests and builds urban innovations to help cities meet their biggest challenges\u201d.</p> <p>Reflecting ideas being developed across the world, what they have planned is a \u201csmart city\u201d, at the cutting-edge of just about everything. If it comes to pass, its basis will be 17,000 units of housing, 40% of which would be dedicated to \u201clower- and middle-income families\u201d. Just about all its buildings will be based on the use of wood. There are plans for prototype <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/2019/03/11/building-raincoat-prototype-sidewalk-labs-toronto-smart-city/\" title=\"\">\u201craincoats\u201d</a> that would cover open space and thereby regulate the climate. Some streets will be \u201cdynamic\u201d, so their use \u2013 by pedestrians, bikes, or cars \u2013 could change throughout the day.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a2a9f76b6dc04d7aeb93cb9754219ace751822fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a2a9f76b6dc04d7aeb93cb9754219ace751822fe/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Toronto\u2019s waterfront is considered to be the largest area of undeveloped real estate in North America.

Sidewalk Labs says people\u2019s privacy will be protected by the fact that anyone using data will have to sign up to a \u201cresponsible data impact assessment\u201d and that the ownership of data will rest with an \u201cindependent civic data trust\u201d, but to many people, these inevitably sound like opaque, abstract ideas. </p> <p>Waterfront Toronto says it has \u201cmade a clear, public commitment to the protection of public privacy\u201d and that it will abide by a \u201cprivacy by design\u201d standard developed by Dr Ann Cavoukian, a leading Canadian privacy expert. But along with another adviser to the project, Cavoukian has now pulled out of the project because of privacy concerns: \u201cI imagined us creating a smart city of privacy, as opposed to a smart city of surveillance,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Sidewalk Labs\u2019 arrival in Toronto was formally announced in October 2017, when the-then executive chairman of Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet, Eric Schmidt, shared a stage in the city with the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau. In the past, said Schmidt, he and his colleagues had thought \u201cabout all the things we could do if someone would just give us a city and put us in charge,\u201d before he laughed, and added: \u201cThat\u2019s not how it works, for all sorts of good reasons.\u201d With his usual breezy enthusiasm, Trudeau said the development would be a \u201ctestbed for new technologies ... that will help us build cleaner, smarter, greener cities.\u201d Eighteen months on, polls say <a href=\"https://www.smartcitiesworld.net/news/news/poll-suggests-55-support-sidewalk-labs-toronto-project-as-grassroots-group-mobilises-to-block-it-3902\" title=\"\">55% of Toronto\u2019s residents support the plan</a>.</p> <p>Opposition to it <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/would-you-let-google-run-your-city\" title=\"\">has only just started to cohere</a> \u2013 chiefly in the form of a new campaign group called <a href=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2019/02/25/newly-formed-citizens-group-aims-to-block-sidewalk-labs-project.html\" title=\"\">Block Sidewalk</a>. One of its key voices is <a href=\"https://www.citylab.com/life/2018/12/bianca-wylie-interview-toronto-quayside-protest-criticism/574477/\" title=\"\">Bianca Wylie</a>, whose expertise lies in technology and public engagement. \u201cNo one even asked for this thing,\u201d she says: \u201cThe people of Toronto didn\u2019t want a smart city or a smart neighbourhood \u2013 and now we\u2019re having the wrong conversation. It\u2019s all, \u2018How do we pull this off?\u2019 Not, \u2018Do we even want it?\u2019 That\u2019s the slide that happens.\u201d</p> <p>Wylie can talk about the data and surveillance aspects of what Sidewalk Labs seems to have planned, much of which remain unclear. But she puts more emphasis on the fact that the authorities in Toronto seem to have moved into talking about the details of the project before anyone has thought through the much more basic stuff, about how to create the right legal and regulatory framework for such a mind-boggling vision: \u201cWe don\u2019t have policies and laws to manage something like this,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s such a fundamental part of the problem. In a democracy, you\u2019re supposed to get your policies and laws in order first. Now, you\u2019ve got the vendor at the table, influencing all these things.\u201d</p> <p>At first, it looked like the Sidewalk Labs smart city would cover around 12 acres. But last month, leaked documents reported in <a href=\"https://www.thestar.com/opinion/contributors/2019/02/19/sidewalk-labs-we-werent-trying-to-do-anything-in-secret.html\" title=\"\">the Toronto Star</a> revealed plans for the redevelopment of the waterfront to actually cover 350 acres (and house as many as 75,000 additional people), and that Google would take a portion of property taxes, development fees and tax revenue generated by increased property values. This, says Wylie, finally catalysed hostility to the whole plan: \u201cIf all these things had been identified at the beginning,\u201d she says, \u201ca lot more people would have sat up. That\u2019s why [the way] they have been allowed to operate has been so fundamentally anti-democratic. If they had come out and said, \u2018We want to finance transit infrastructure, we want a cut of development fees, we want to get in on municipal revenue\u2019, you would have a lot of people organising, But that only came out because of a document leak.\u201d</p> <p>Towards the end of our conversation, Wylie mentions one more remarkable thing \u2013 the fact that what is planned for Toronto is unprecedented, in every conceivable way: \u201cThe fascinating thing about this project is, Sidewalk Labs has no r\u00e9sum\u00e9. They haven\u2019t done anything. Usually when you get awarded contracts like this, you\u2019ve got 10 or 15 years of experience. But these guys have nothing.\u201d</p> <p>Back in East Palo Alto, as well as expanding its existing HQ, Facebook has just taken another step towards plans for a new development called Willow Village, which will include a huge office complex, shops, hotels and a town square, and employment for more than 8,000 people. There will also be housing, but only 225 out of 1500 units will be set aside for \u201clow-income households and seniors\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThey are going to do some major, major expansion,\u201d says Faraji. \u201cAnd when they do, I suspect the rest of the people that look like me and have been here for a long time \u2013 the ones who are renting, anyway \u2013 are going to be gone. I just don\u2019t see how people are going to be able to afford to be here any more.\u201d</p> <p>I wonder: does he have any advice for people fighting big tech elsewhere?</p> <p>\u201cCome together as a community. Do not allow your leaders to accept money for their organisations from tech companies. That\u2019s what happened here. If you\u2019re not together, it will be an uphill battle.\u201d</p> <p>There is only one question left. Does he think he\u2019ll stay, even as Facebook endlessly expands?</p> <p>What he says next cuts straight to the simplest kind of resistance: just staying put, and remaining defiant: \u201cOh, I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p>",

          "bodyText": "\u2018It\u2019s a challenge out here. The way the tech companies are building and increasing their size is just pricing people out. Families who have been here for generations can\u2019t afford to be here any more. They\u2019re being pushed off into rural areas \u2013 anywhere from an hour to two and a half hours away.\u201d JT Faraji is a 43-year-old artist who lives with his family in East Palo Alto, the northern California city on the edge of Silicon Valley. Just a stone\u2019s throw away, Facebook\u2019s global headquarters is his most visible neighbour, and he is also close to a big new Amazon office. He has lived in the area all his life and talks volubly about fascinating aspects of East Palo Alto\u2019s history \u2013 like the period in the 1960s when black activists set up a high school and college, and there was even talk of renaming the city Nairobi: \u201cThere are a lot of minorities here: Hispanics, blacks, Pacific Islanders,\u201d he says. \u201cBut those people are not really represented in the workforce in technology. So the way that northern California is going to look in not too long is going to be very \u2026 undiverse.\u201d In 2017, as part of a local grassroots group called the Real Community Coalition, Faraji began to put pressure on Facebook to \u2013 among other things \u2013 address concerns about housing and hire more local people. The coalition protested, organised vigils and eventually sat down with people from the company to discuss what was happening to their area. \u201cWhat mostly came out of that was a lot of hot air, pushing back,\u201d says Faraji. \u201cBasically stalling and stalling and stalling.\u201d Facebook has a local hiring programme, but Faraji says its focus on people in their 20s has cut out most of East Palo Alto\u2019s community. (In response to inquiries from the Guardian, Facebook acknowledged its work on local employment with a social enterprise called Year Up, which is dedicated to 18 to 24-year-olds, but also mentioned \u201ccommunity job fairs\u201d, efforts to connect \u201clocal residents directly to Facebook recruiters\u201d, and workshops on \u201cresume writing and interviewing skills\u201d). In late 2016, the company had also co-founded what it called the Catalyst Housing Fund, and contributed around $20m (\u00a315.3m), though Faraji says he has seen no signs of the money being spent; Facebook says that two and a half years after the fund was established, there are now plans for 261 new affordable housing units, but that \u201ctiming of project completion depends on the city\u2019s remaining approval processes for the projects\u201d. The Real Community Coalition has now fallen from view \u2013 partly, he says, because of the effects of Facebook donating to the very non-profit groups that have traditionally fought for local people: \u201cThey are usually the first line of defence, at least in our community: organisations that are trying to combat gentrification or fight for affordable housing or what have you. But now, some don\u2019t want to bite the hand that feeds them. And then there\u2019s just a massive population turnover that\u2019s been happening in the last two years.\u201d Like a lot of what he says, the words are full of a deep sadness. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to fight for people who are leaving, and no longer here.\u201d The rest of the world is now starting to understand what the residents of East Palo Alto \u2013 and indeed, a huge chunk of northern California \u2013 have known for years: that big tech has not just colonised the online realm: it has an increasingly visible presence in the physical world. Leaving aside Amazon\u2019s globally ubiquitous fulfilment centres, they, Facebook and Google now have huge premises \u2013 \u201chubs\u201d, \u201ccampuses\u201d, old-fashioned offices \u2013 in cities across the planet, with even more to come. The change may have come too late for some of the people of East Palo Alto, but in the past two years or so, something has shifted. Now, as they are planned, proposed and built, these developments are increasingly being contested by coalitions of activists who follow each other\u2019s campaigns and draw on a growing pool of knowledge and experience. Because new big tech projects often arrive in areas beyond city centres, where property is comparatively cheap and many people from ethnic minorities have made their home, the campaigns against them are often led by people of colour. A big issue is the often cosy relationship between companies and politicians, who regularly do their best to push things along by sweetening planning agreements with tax breaks and generous grants. The issues proliferate: from the private takeover of public space, through basic questions of local democracy, to issues around work and pay. As cities endlessly expand and the power of tech corporations grows, if you want a sense of the future of grassroots politics, this is a very good place to look. The forces opposing big tech recently won a key victory in the New York borough of Queens, where Amazon\u2019s plans to locate a huge chunk of the corporate office project it calls HQ2 in Long Island City \u2013 where 25% of the population is African American and 40% Hispanic or Latino \u2013 were so fiercely contested that the company beat a hasty retreat. In the midst of a somewhat absurd competition between US cities to attract Amazon to their locality, proposals had included a package of tax breaks and grants secretly negotiated by the New York state governor Andrew Cuomo and the city\u2019s mayor Bill de Blasio that totalled nearly $3bn. It also raised the link between Amazon and the US\u2019s Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency (Ice). The agency uses Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services, and Amazon has tried to persuade its officials to use the company\u2019s face recognition software: a huge issue among many of the communities often on the receiving end of Ice\u2019s cruelties. But perhaps the key focus for campaigners \u2013 who include local congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \u2013 was urban gentrification, and what activists call \u201cdisplacement\u201d: the way big corporate developments usually lead to local people being forced out of the places they call home. The Amazon development was centred on 25,000 jobs that the company said would be paid an average salary of $150,000: many locals saw the prospect of a huge influx of white, wealthy outsiders, and loudly opposed it. A big voice in the campaign is Maritza Silva-Farrell, the executive director of the Alliance for A Greater New York (Align), a grassroots organisation addressing issues of inequality and the environment. When we speak, she is in Seattle, meeting politicians in Amazon\u2019s home city in the company of activists from Nashville, where Amazon is committed to a new \u201ccentre of excellence\u201d that will employ around 5,000 people. She says she has also regularly been in touch with people in Spain and Germany, where Amazon workers staged strikes about employment conditions last year: \u201cWe always speak about this campaign as a global campaign, because Amazon isn\u2019t a local corporation.\u201d Was she surprised that her side won? \u201cI\u2019ve never run a campaign that only took four months,\u201d she says. \u201cThe announcement came out in November and Amazon was out of the city by February. I\u2019m hoping it signals to other corporations that they can\u2019t come into town and say: \u2018We want this, and this, and this \u2013 and we\u2019ll create some jobs, but we\u2019ll tell you how many later.\u2019 You should come, and talk to our community, and see what the needs of the community are, and have a real plan of investment.\u201d Silva-Farrell is now having conversations with campaigners in and around Arlington, Virginia, where Amazon has plans to open what has ended up as the sole HQ2 complex, on much the same scale as what it proposed for Queens. Its location is very close to Washington DC; the finished development will feature huge apartment blocks, a 49,000 sq ft cinema and \u201ca 23-storey luxury apartment complex with a private Whole Foods [supermarket] entrance\u201d. The development will be named National Landing, though it sits amid places that already exist: Pentagon City, Crystal City, and Potomac Yard \u2013 where, as in Queens, rising rents and impossible living costs are already highly charged issues. Every aspect of the Virginia story echoes what happened in New York. Amazon will receive \u201cperformance-based incentives\u201d totalling around $750m (\u00a3575m) from the state authorities if its plans come to fruition. With Arlington County\u2019s hotel tax revenue expected to rise with Amazon\u2019s arrival, the company will also get up to 15% of a local tax on hotels if it meets certain goals for how much space its new offices fill. In case anyone thought this wasn\u2019t quite generous enough, two weeks ago, county authorities in Arlington also approved a package of \u201cpay for performance\u201d grants to Amazon that could total $23m. The meeting where this happened was addressed by activists from a local coalition called For Us Not Amazon, whose leaders say that among the biggest issues they face is people\u2019s lack of awareness about Amazon\u2019s plans. Danny Cendejas is an organiser with La ColectiVA, a grassroots organisation working among Virginia\u2019s Hispanic and Latino communities. What often hits him, he says, is an engagement gap made worse by the failure of both Amazon and the relevant local authorities to open up to people how their decisions will directly affect them \u2013 it is grimly symbolic, he says, that \u201con the county board\u2019s website, if you go to the link in Spanish and search \u2018Amazon\u2019, there\u2019s not a single hit that comes up\u201d. Like the Queens campaigners, Cendejas is appalled by Amazon\u2019s links to Ice and its work. Local officials and politicians, he says, ought to \u201cpublicly call on Amazon to end collaboration with that. They should be willing to be courageous and call on Amazon to do that, if Amazon want to be good neighbours.\u201d The other subject he talks about is the fragile state of communities threatened by rising rents and property prices. \u201cThe issue is here already,\u201d he says. \u201cIn this past year alone, from the conversations I\u2019ve been having with people, there\u2019s been an increase of around $200 [a month] in rent. For folks who are working paycheck to paycheck, that\u2019s a huge difference. \u201cAt least five of the families I\u2019ve been working with over the last six months have had to leave the area because of the cost of living. Amazon would exacerbate that, particularly as there have been no guarantees that people could carry on living where they live.\u201d The least that should happen, he says, is that the proposed giveaways to Amazon from public funds could be taken back, and invested \u201cin affordable housing, to be anti-displacement. That\u2019s an obvious idea.\u201d When I contact Amazon for its take on both its pull-out from Queens and opposition to its plans for Virginia, the company does not respond. Cendejas, by contrast, is very vocal about the threads that connect both stories. \u201cThe Queens win was a win for all communities of colour, and all low-income communities and all immigrant communities across the country. We celebrated with them. The concerns that people in Queens had were the same concerns we have here. And they\u2019re not being addressed.\u201d Resistance to big tech is not only gaining momentum in the US. In November 2016, Google announced that it was going to open a new \u201ccampus\u201d in the Kreuzberg area of Berlin. Aimed at providing a space in which employees could mentor new tech startups, it was to occupy 3,000 sq ft in a disused electricity substation, located in the heart of one of the city\u2019s most renowned neighbourhoods. In the days of the cold war, Kreuzberg became a byword for West Berlin\u2019s Turkish population and bohemian subcultures: it was the one-time stamping ground of David Bowie and Nick Cave, and attracted thousands of punks and hippies avoiding West German national service. Twenty-seven years after the fall of the Berlin wall, it had become a noticeably more affluent area, but still retained enough of its old identity to convince Google it was a perfect place to be. In response to the company\u2019s announcement, the city authorities seemed exultant: \u201cToday is a good day for Berlin,\u201d said the city\u2019s mayor, Michael Muller. But the fact that Kreuzberg had held on to an enduring idea of its outsider status eventually proved to be Google\u2019s undoing, thanks to a loose coalition of local activists who were set on keeping it out. One of its elements was a group of techies elegantly named Fuck Off Google. Another was a neighbourhood organisation called Bizim Kiez, meaning \u201cour quarter\u201d, whose activists had first come together to save a Turkish shop. A third was GloReiche (a play on the German word for \u201cglorious\u201d), another neighbourhood collective that had recently worked to keep a bakery open. One of GloReiche\u2019s prime movers is Stefan Klein, a self-employed media law specialist who has lived in Kreuzberg for a decade: \u201cWe thought Google would be a tough opponent,\u201d he says. \u201cEverybody loves Google, everybody uses Google, Google is free, it has great products, and so on and so on. We thought: \u2018It will be difficult to tell people why we think this is a bad idea.\u2019\u201d Very quickly, though, opinion began to turn. In the past five years, rents in Kreuzberg are reckoned to have gone up 30% \u2013 and there was widespread fear that Google\u2019s arrival would push them even higher. The fact that the new campus was intended to develop startups suggested to many Kreuzbergers that it would essentially amount to a gentrification factory, sending out swarms of new tech businesses to eventually take over the neighbourhood. And as Klein explains, there was also a fear of what the company\u2019s arrival would mean for deep issues about the area\u2019s infrastructure, alongside concerns about the opportunities that would arise for the company to harvest an ocean of information about people\u2019s lives on the basis of what was planned in Toronto (more of that below): \u201cWherever Google goes,\u201d he says, \u201cthey take over. They offer public services like transportation, or even controlling traffic lights \u2013 everything. For free, they say. But it\u2019s never for free: they always want data. That\u2019s the point.\u201d Throughout their campaign, the Kreuzberg activists were in contact with grassroots anti-Google campaigners in Toronto and the company\u2019s home city of San Francisco: comparing notes, pooling research and keeping in touch with each other\u2019s activities. And after months of street protest, meetings, and door-to-door canvassing, in late October 2018, Google announced that it was pulling its plans: it would retain its lease on the property in question, but for the next five years, the space would be used by two social enterprises. The company will not be directly quoted on its plans, but a Google spokesperson says he is confident the new arrangement will be \u201csomething for longer term\u201d. Klein remains sceptical: \u201cI think they\u2019re hoping that we\u2019re asleep, and we\u2019re not fighting any more, and they can move in easily,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re doing more actions again in May \u2013 telling people what is happening. Because they\u2019ve heard it from the press, most people think: \u2018Oh, they\u2019ve won, everything is fine.\u2019\u201d He suddenly sounds worried. \u201cWe don\u2019t think so.\u201d In Toronto, perhaps the most jaw-dropping story to date about big tech and the future of cities is rapidly taking shape. The city\u2019s waterfront is reckoned to be the largest area of undeveloped real estate in North America \u2013 which, under the supervision of a public body called Waterfront Toronto, may soon be transformed. The company in charge will be Sidewalk Labs, an offshoot of Google that \u201cimagines, designs, tests and builds urban innovations to help cities meet their biggest challenges\u201d. Reflecting ideas being developed across the world, what they have planned is a \u201csmart city\u201d, at the cutting-edge of just about everything. If it comes to pass, its basis will be 17,000 units of housing, 40% of which would be dedicated to \u201clower- and middle-income families\u201d. Just about all its buildings will be based on the use of wood. There are plans for prototype \u201craincoats\u201d that would cover open space and thereby regulate the climate. Some streets will be \u201cdynamic\u201d, so their use \u2013 by pedestrians, bikes, or cars \u2013 could change throughout the day. Perhaps most importantly, the efficiency and environmental sustainability of the whole thing will be based on the use of huge amounts of data generated by its residents as they go about their daily lives. Sidewalk Labs says people\u2019s privacy will be protected by the fact that anyone using data will have to sign up to a \u201cresponsible data impact assessment\u201d and that the ownership of data will rest with an \u201cindependent civic data trust\u201d, but to many people, these inevitably sound like opaque, abstract ideas. Waterfront Toronto says it has \u201cmade a clear, public commitment to the protection of public privacy\u201d and that it will abide by a \u201cprivacy by design\u201d standard developed by Dr Ann Cavoukian, a leading Canadian privacy expert. But along with another adviser to the project, Cavoukian has now pulled out of the project because of privacy concerns: \u201cI imagined us creating a smart city of privacy, as opposed to a smart city of surveillance,\u201d she says. Sidewalk Labs\u2019 arrival in Toronto was formally announced in October 2017, when the-then executive chairman of Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet, Eric Schmidt, shared a stage in the city with the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau. In the past, said Schmidt, he and his colleagues had thought \u201cabout all the things we could do if someone would just give us a city and put us in charge,\u201d before he laughed, and added: \u201cThat\u2019s not how it works, for all sorts of good reasons.\u201d With his usual breezy enthusiasm, Trudeau said the development would be a \u201ctestbed for new technologies ... that will help us build cleaner, smarter, greener cities.\u201d Eighteen months on, polls say 55% of Toronto\u2019s residents support the plan. Opposition to it has only just started to cohere \u2013 chiefly in the form of a new campaign group called Block Sidewalk. One of its key voices is Bianca Wylie, whose expertise lies in technology and public engagement. \u201cNo one even asked for this thing,\u201d she says: \u201cThe people of Toronto didn\u2019t want a smart city or a smart neighbourhood \u2013 and now we\u2019re having the wrong conversation. It\u2019s all, \u2018How do we pull this off?\u2019 Not, \u2018Do we even want it?\u2019 That\u2019s the slide that happens.\u201d Wylie can talk about the data and surveillance aspects of what Sidewalk Labs seems to have planned, much of which remain unclear. But she puts more emphasis on the fact that the authorities in Toronto seem to have moved into talking about the details of the project before anyone has thought through the much more basic stuff, about how to create the right legal and regulatory framework for such a mind-boggling vision: \u201cWe don\u2019t have policies and laws to manage something like this,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s such a fundamental part of the problem. In a democracy, you\u2019re supposed to get your policies and laws in order first. Now, you\u2019ve got the vendor at the table, influencing all these things.\u201d At first, it looked like the Sidewalk Labs smart city would cover around 12 acres. But last month, leaked documents reported in the Toronto Star revealed plans for the redevelopment of the waterfront to actually cover 350 acres (and house as many as 75,000 additional people), and that Google would take a portion of property taxes, development fees and tax revenue generated by increased property values. This, says Wylie, finally catalysed hostility to the whole plan: \u201cIf all these things had been identified at the beginning,\u201d she says, \u201ca lot more people would have sat up. That\u2019s why [the way] they have been allowed to operate has been so fundamentally anti-democratic. If they had come out and said, \u2018We want to finance transit infrastructure, we want a cut of development fees, we want to get in on municipal revenue\u2019, you would have a lot of people organising, But that only came out because of a document leak.\u201d Towards the end of our conversation, Wylie mentions one more remarkable thing \u2013 the fact that what is planned for Toronto is unprecedented, in every conceivable way: \u201cThe fascinating thing about this project is, Sidewalk Labs has no r\u00e9sum\u00e9. They haven\u2019t done anything. Usually when you get awarded contracts like this, you\u2019ve got 10 or 15 years of experience. But these guys have nothing.\u201d Back in East Palo Alto, as well as expanding its existing HQ, Facebook has just taken another step towards plans for a new development called Willow Village, which will include a huge office complex, shops, hotels and a town square, and employment for more than 8,000 people. There will also be housing, but only 225 out of 1500 units will be set aside for \u201clow-income households and seniors\u201d. \u201cThey are going to do some major, major expansion,\u201d says Faraji. \u201cAnd when they do, I suspect the rest of the people that look like me and have been here for a long time \u2013 the ones who are renting, anyway \u2013 are going to be gone. I just don\u2019t see how people are going to be able to afford to be here any more.\u201d I wonder: does he have any advice for people fighting big tech elsewhere? \u201cCome together as a community. Do not allow your leaders to accept money for their organisations from tech companies. That\u2019s what happened here. If you\u2019re not together, it will be an uphill battle.\u201d There is only one question left. Does he think he\u2019ll stay, even as Facebook endlessly expands? What he says next cuts straight to the simplest kind of resistance: just staying put, and remaining defiant: \u201cOh, I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d",

Just under half the sample, 49%, believed that television networks and mainstream media outlets that have provided platforms for people with extreme and racist views need to bear some responsibility for the attack and just under half the sample (42%) agreed with the statement \u201cpoliticians from Australia\u2019s major parties have deliberately stirred up anti-Islamic sentiment as a way of getting votes\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Koala populations on Australia\u2019s east coast have diminished to the extent the species <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/mar/26/koalas-should-be-given-endangered-listing-environment-groups-say\">should now be considered \u201cendangered\u201d</a>, environment groups have said.</strong> In south-east Queensland, once a stronghold for koala populations, habitat continues to be bulldozed through ineffective offset strategies, loopholes in development restrictions and poor planning for population growth, the groups said. From 1990 to 2016, at least 9.6m hectares of koala habitat was bulldozed in Queensland and New South Wales. WWF-Australia says it is the slow creep of small developments \u2013 which bulldoze a hectare or two at a time \u2013 rather than broadscale clearing that has put once-thriving populations and habitat under threat. </p> <p><strong>The federal vice-president of the Liberal party has delivered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/mar/26/qa-train-wreck-liberal-teena-mcqueens-debut-goes-from-bad-to-worse\">a train wreck performance on the ABC\u2019s Q&amp;A</a></strong>, in which she accused New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern of \u201ccopying\u201d John Howard\u2019s gun laws. Teena McQueen also had to be warned by host Tony Jones about potentially \u201cdefamatory\u201d remarks about Greens leader Richard Di Natale. American writer Roxane Gay said Ardern \u201cdid the right political thing by, within six days, banning semiautomatic weapons\u201d. McQueen interjected and said \u201cwe did that years ago. The Liberal party did that years ago with John Howard\u201d, to groans from the audience. McQueen dominated the program, repeatedly interrupting co-panellists on subjects including racism and white extremism.</p> <h2>World</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3ddaffeabdf40713d382d533097e31bc6cf3221b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ddaffeabdf40713d382d533097e31bc6cf3221b/0_0_4560_2736/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The official reprieve played into a narrative that Trump has been building for two years, portraying the Mueller investigation a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d, \u201choax\u201d and \u201cdeep state\u201d conspiracy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Mueller report\u2019s official reprieve played into a narrative that Trump has been building for two years, portraying the investigation as a \u2018witch-hunt\u2019, \u2018hoax\u2019 and \u2018deep state\u2019 conspiracy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Susan Walsh/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong><br>Donald Trump is set to </strong><strong>co-opt the special counsel\u2019s finding of no collusion with Russia in his bid for re-election,</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/25/donald-trump-mueller-report-no-collusion-weaponize-democrats-media\">turning vindication into vengeance</a> with an assault on Democrats and the media. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/25/william-barr-letter-mueller-report\">Here\u2019s what we learned</a> from William Barr\u2019s summary of the report, and here\u2019s what we know about Barr \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/25/trump-russia-william-barr-republican-spear-catcher\">no stranger to playing Republican spear-catcher</a>.

If you actually look at Canadian politics, and try to ignore the foreign media\u2019s perception of Trudeau \u2013 they see him as a Calvin Klein model who\u2019s pretty good at Sporcle quizzes \u2013 a darker picture emerges. The country is facing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/25/justin-trudeau-dumbing-down-foreign-news\">a huge corruption case</a> that threatens to bring down the prime minister, the government and one of the biggest contractors in the country.</p> <p><strong>Cost is the scariest part of going to the dentist, </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2019/mar/26/fear-factor-why-cost-is-the-scariest-part-of-going-to-the-dentist-in-australia\">writes Greg Jericho</a>. \u201cA recent Grattan Institute report estimates that in the last year over 2 million of the Australians who needed a dentist skipped a visit because of the cost. It is clear that to talk of a universal and equal healthcare without including dental health means overlooking a major aspect of our quality of life, and condemns those on lower incomes to worse health.\u201d</p> <p><strong>An ominous red river divides the small mining town of Queenstown in the isolated west of Tasmania. </strong>The river\u2019s colour is<strong> </strong>a result of copper run-off from a closed mine and is an ever-present reminder of the town\u2019s history of environmental and industrial disaster. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/video/2019/mar/25/where-the-river-runs-red-a-mining-community-caught-between-the-past-and-a-sustainable-future\">Where the River Runs Red</a> explores a community in an economically crippled area caught between the past and a future that is less reliant on a mining economy.</p> <h2>Sport</h2> <p><strong>Romeo and Juliet had an easier time getting together than Anthony Joshua and Tyson Fury have experienced lately,</strong> writes Kevin Mitchell.

More than half of the town\u2019s 94,000 acres are bushy blue-green fields growing the crop. Massive industrial storehouses line the southern end of town, packed with thousands upon thousands of stacks of alfalfa bales ready to be fed to dairy cows \u2013 but not cows in California\u2019s Central Valley or Montana\u2019s rangelands. Instead,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/25/california-water-drought-scarce-saudi-arabia\"> the alfalfa will be fed to cows in Saudi Arabia.</a></p> <p>The storehouses belong to Fondomonte Farms, a subsidiary of the Saudi Arabia-based company Almarai \u2013 one of the largest food production companies in the world. Each month, Fondomonte Farms loads the alfalfa on to hulking metal shipping containers destined to arrive at a massive port just outside King Abdullah City in Saudi Arabia. With the landscape there being mostly desert, and alfalfa being a water-intensive crop, growing it has always been expensive and draining on scarce water resources, to the point that the Saudi government finally outlawed the practice in 2016. In the wake of the ban, Almarai decided to purchase land wherever it is cheap and has favourable water conditions to produce enough feed for its 93,000 cows.</p> <h2>Media roundup</h2> <p>The <strong>ABC</strong> reports that secret recordings show <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-03-26/secret-recordings-show-one-nation-staffers-seeking-nra-donations/10936052\">One Nation sought millions of dollars in political donations from America\u2019s National Rifle Association</a>.

A majority of the sample (69%) believed social media platforms should be forced to ensure violent material is not broadcast through their sites, with strong support for that across all voting groups \u2013 and 63% agreed with the statement white extremism is every bit as dangerous as Islamic fundamentalism, again with strong agreement among Labor, Coalition and Greens voters. Just under half the sample, 49%, believed that television networks and mainstream media outlets that have provided platforms for people with extreme and racist views need to bear some responsibility for the attack and just under half the sample (42%) agreed with the statement \u201cpoliticians from Australia\u2019s major parties have deliberately stirred up anti-Islamic sentiment as a way of getting votes\u201d. Koala populations on Australia\u2019s east coast have diminished to the extent the species should now be considered \u201cendangered\u201d, environment groups have said. In south-east Queensland, once a stronghold for koala populations, habitat continues to be bulldozed through ineffective offset strategies, loopholes in development restrictions and poor planning for population growth, the groups said. From 1990 to 2016, at least 9.6m hectares of koala habitat was bulldozed in Queensland and New South Wales. WWF-Australia says it is the slow creep of small developments \u2013 which bulldoze a hectare or two at a time \u2013 rather than broadscale clearing that has put once-thriving populations and habitat under threat. The federal vice-president of the Liberal party has delivered a train wreck performance on the ABC\u2019s Q&amp;A, in which she accused New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern of \u201ccopying\u201d John Howard\u2019s gun laws. Teena McQueen also had to be warned by host Tony Jones about potentially \u201cdefamatory\u201d remarks about Greens leader Richard Di Natale. American writer Roxane Gay said Ardern \u201cdid the right political thing by, within six days, banning semiautomatic weapons\u201d. McQueen interjected and said \u201cwe did that years ago. The Liberal party did that years ago with John Howard\u201d, to groans from the audience. McQueen dominated the program, repeatedly interrupting co-panellists on subjects including racism and white extremism. World Donald Trump is set to co-opt the special counsel\u2019s finding of no collusion with Russia in his bid for re-election, turning vindication into vengeance with an assault on Democrats and the media. Here\u2019s what we learned from William Barr\u2019s summary of the report, and here\u2019s what we know about Barr \u2013 no stranger to playing Republican spear-catcher. Russia, meanwhile, says the report \u201cproved what we already knew\u201d. Israel\u2019s military says it has begun striking \u201cHamas terror targets\u201d across the Gaza Strip, retaliating for an earlier rocket attack that wounded seven people in a neighbourhood north of Tel Aviv. Students of Parkland, a Florida high school where a gunman killed 17 people last year, are mourning the deaths of what they consider two more victims of the tragedy \u2013 teenagers who apparently died in suicides one week apart. Michael Avenatti, the former lawyer for Stormy Daniels, has been indicted on extortion charges and arrested. According to a criminal complaint filed by federal authorities in New York, Avenatti was charged with attempting to extort millions of dollars out of Nike. At least two people owe their lives to Taco Bell hot sauce after near-death experiences in recent weeks. A Man in Oregon trapped in his car for five days ate hot sauce to survive, and moments after a Taco Bell customer got up from his seat to retrieve some hot sauce, a car burst through the restaurant\u2019s wall. Opinion and analysis Why the silence around the scandal threatening Justin Trudeau? asks Jack Bernhardt. If you actually look at Canadian politics, and try to ignore the foreign media\u2019s perception of Trudeau \u2013 they see him as a Calvin Klein model who\u2019s pretty good at Sporcle quizzes \u2013 a darker picture emerges. The country is facing a huge corruption case that threatens to bring down the prime minister, the government and one of the biggest contractors in the country. Cost is the scariest part of going to the dentist, writes Greg Jericho. \u201cA recent Grattan Institute report estimates that in the last year over 2 million of the Australians who needed a dentist skipped a visit because of the cost. It is clear that to talk of a universal and equal healthcare without including dental health means overlooking a major aspect of our quality of life, and condemns those on lower incomes to worse health.\u201d An ominous red river divides the small mining town of Queenstown in the isolated west of Tasmania. The river\u2019s colour is a result of copper run-off from a closed mine and is an ever-present reminder of the town\u2019s history of environmental and industrial disaster. Where the River Runs Red explores a community in an economically crippled area caught between the past and a future that is less reliant on a mining economy. Sport Romeo and Juliet had an easier time getting together than Anthony Joshua and Tyson Fury have experienced lately, writes Kevin Mitchell. The courting of the voluble Gypsy King as the perfect ticket-selling foil for the sweet-talking triple-belt world heavyweight champion continues behind the scenes. As fog blankets the pitch on a Monday evening training session, a group of Under-12 academy footballers strive to generate sharp passes, quick feet, clever movement. Everybody looks the part. This particular everybody, though, is not your standard issue elite group, writes Amy Lawrence. Among the boys are Maddy and Laila, two exceptional prospects from the Arsenal girls\u2019 team. Thinking time: who keeps buying California\u2019s scarce water? Four hours east of Los Angeles, in a drought-stricken area of a drought-afflicted state, is a small town called Blythe where alfalfa is king. More than half of the town\u2019s 94,000 acres are bushy blue-green fields growing the crop. Massive industrial storehouses line the southern end of town, packed with thousands upon thousands of stacks of alfalfa bales ready to be fed to dairy cows \u2013 but not cows in California\u2019s Central Valley or Montana\u2019s rangelands. Instead, the alfalfa will be fed to cows in Saudi Arabia. The storehouses belong to Fondomonte Farms, a subsidiary of the Saudi Arabia-based company Almarai \u2013 one of the largest food production companies in the world. Each month, Fondomonte Farms loads the alfalfa on to hulking metal shipping containers destined to arrive at a massive port just outside King Abdullah City in Saudi Arabia. With the landscape there being mostly desert, and alfalfa being a water-intensive crop, growing it has always been expensive and draining on scarce water resources, to the point that the Saudi government finally outlawed the practice in 2016. In the wake of the ban, Almarai decided to purchase land wherever it is cheap and has favourable water conditions to produce enough feed for its 93,000 cows. Media roundup The ABC reports that secret recordings show One Nation sought millions of dollars in political donations from America\u2019s National Rifle Association. The Age reveals that when Scott Morrison was immigration minister, he proposed a $9bn-$10bn program building mass detention facilities in Australia for asylum seekers already in the country on bridging visas. A fall in markets over concerns about global economic growth and a fall in 10-year US Treasury yields to one-year lows mean the ASX will open lower this morning, for the second straight session, according to the Australian Financial Review. This follows Australia\u2019s 10-year bond rate tumbling to a historic low of 1.76%. Coming up The Wilderness Society is taking the federal government to court over its decision to approve a luxury tourism development at Lake Malbena in Tasmania\u2019s remote north.

He\u2019s a fiery liberal, writing articles for a Brooklyn newspaper like \u201cWhy The Two-Party System Can Suck A Dick\u201d.

It\u2019s Rogen\u2019s wheelhouse, and he\u2019s dependably hilarious whether exploding into a bombastic yet awkward speech, getting up to stoner shenanigans, or pratfalling down a flight of stairs.

But romantic comedy is a different beast. In a post-screening Q&amp;A, Theron admitted to a packed house that she was nervous to take it on. She needn\u2019t have been. Cool, confident and sexy, Theron proves a pitch-perfect straight man to Rogen\u2019s garrulous goofball, the Dean Martin to his Jerry Lewis. But Long Shot also exposes the lengths to which women in the public eye must go to seem cool and confident, which allows Theron to work in a keen vulnerability and feminist underpinning. She sparks with smirks, earned f-bombs, and a sequence where a stressed out Charlotte is high on party drugs and crusted in confetti, while navigating an international hostage crisis. Theron brings not only jokes but also dimension to this dream girl role, winning hearts and laughs.</p> \n<p>The cast is packed with outstandingly funny players. Bob Odenkirk brilliantly blusters as a \u201cdumb-fuck president\u201d, while Andy Serkis sinks his teeth into a mirthful Murdoch caricature. Comedy nerds will squeal over June Diane Raphael as Charlotte\u2019s side-eying right-hand woman, or Paul Scheer, Kurt Braunohler and Claudia O\u2019Doherty as a Fox News-like talkshow team. But the surprising standouts in the supporting cast are Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd and O\u2019Shea Jackson Jr. In a frumpy brown wig that seems like thrown shade, Skarsg\u00e5rd plays this world\u2019s Trudeau, giving over-eager smiles, a sweetly dorky vibe, and a Canadian-accented \u201csorry\u201d. It\u2019s a bit part, but he makes a meal out of it, somehow turning eating oysters into a deeply unsexy affair, and screeching out a laugh that is alarming and hysterical. Meanwhile, Jackson, who had previously impressed in Straight Outta Compton and Ingrid Goes West, proves a crackling comic actor as Flarsky\u2019s best friend, a successful and suave Manhattanite with an unmatched skill for one-liners. Jackson has an electrifying verve and stellar comedic timing that manages to steal the spotlight from one of modern comedy\u2019s biggest stars. If Rogen\u2019s not got a vehicle for Jackson in the works right this second, he\u2019s lost a step in his producing game.</p> \n<p>With a giddy irreverence and a cavalcade of stupendous comedic performers, Long Shot is outrageously funny. The romance works because Rogen and Theron share an easy chemistry, yet the movie never loses sight of how out of his league Flarsky seems. It embraces the fantasy of such a romance, imagining a world where a gorgeous, intelligent and powerful person who moves in circles with affluent, handsome, internationally beloved world leaders, would choose a broke stoner from Brooklyn instead. It\u2019s like Notting Hill for the political set. There\u2019s even a sequence where Boyz II Men pop up for an exhilarating bit of nostalgia and swoon. However, the finale doesn\u2019t stick the landing, taking the romantic fantasy to one of political pipe dream. It makes for a happy ending, but while blithely undercutting the movie\u2019s message of about sexist double standards and female empowerment. Despite this cringe-worthy stumble, Long Shot is a hilarious and heartwarming romantic comedy that will have audiences howling in shock and <em>awwww</em>.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Long Shot is showing at SXSW and will be released on 3 May</p></li> \n</ul>",

She sparks with smirks, earned f-bombs, and a sequence where a stressed out Charlotte is high on party drugs and crusted in confetti, while navigating an international hostage crisis. Theron brings not only jokes but also dimension to this dream girl role, winning hearts and laughs. The cast is packed with outstandingly funny players. Bob Odenkirk brilliantly blusters as a \u201cdumb-fuck president\u201d, while Andy Serkis sinks his teeth into a mirthful Murdoch caricature. Comedy nerds will squeal over June Diane Raphael as Charlotte\u2019s side-eying right-hand woman, or Paul Scheer, Kurt Braunohler and Claudia O\u2019Doherty as a Fox News-like talkshow team. But the surprising standouts in the supporting cast are Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd and O\u2019Shea Jackson Jr. In a frumpy brown wig that seems like thrown shade, Skarsg\u00e5rd plays this world\u2019s Trudeau, giving over-eager smiles, a sweetly dorky vibe, and a Canadian-accented \u201csorry\u201d. It\u2019s a bit part, but he makes a meal out of it, somehow turning eating oysters into a deeply unsexy affair, and screeching out a laugh that is alarming and hysterical. Meanwhile, Jackson, who had previously impressed in Straight Outta Compton and Ingrid Goes West, proves a crackling comic actor as Flarsky\u2019s best friend, a successful and suave Manhattanite with an unmatched skill for one-liners. Jackson has an electrifying verve and stellar comedic timing that manages to steal the spotlight from one of modern comedy\u2019s biggest stars. If Rogen\u2019s not got a vehicle for Jackson in the works right this second, he\u2019s lost a step in his producing game. With a giddy irreverence and a cavalcade of stupendous comedic performers, Long Shot is outrageously funny. The romance works because Rogen and Theron share an easy chemistry, yet the movie never loses sight of how out of his league Flarsky seems. It embraces the fantasy of such a romance, imagining a world where a gorgeous, intelligent and powerful person who moves in circles with affluent, handsome, internationally beloved world leaders, would choose a broke stoner from Brooklyn instead. It\u2019s like Notting Hill for the political set. There\u2019s even a sequence where Boyz II Men pop up for an exhilarating bit of nostalgia and swoon. However, the finale doesn\u2019t stick the landing, taking the romantic fantasy to one of political pipe dream. It makes for a happy ending, but while blithely undercutting the movie\u2019s message of about sexist double standards and female empowerment. Despite this cringe-worthy stumble, Long Shot is a hilarious and heartwarming romantic comedy that will have audiences howling in shock and awwww. Long Shot is showing at SXSW and will be released on 3 May",

The scandal gained new momentum on Monday with the resignation of Jane Philpott, the president of the cabinet\u2019s Treasury Board testimony. Announcing her decision, she cited allegations by former justice minister and attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould that Trudeau and other senior figures had made an \u201cinnappropriate\u201d effort to dissuade Wilson-Raybould from prosecuting Quebec-based engineering giant SNC Lavalin.

A close adviser to Trudeau and longtime friend, Butts has denied Wilson-Raybould\u2019s allegations, but resigned on 18 February.

          "body": "<p>For Canadian liberals, or indeed any of us who cling to outdated ideas such as good governance and liberal democratic values, it was like watching a unicorn get flattened by a lorry. Earlier this week, Canada\u2019s undeniably gorgeous, halo-bound Liberal prime minister, Justin Trudeau \u2013 proud feminist, defender of minority rights, advocate for transparency, inclusivity and decency, and prince of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/may/03/this-is-how-canada-brings-it-justin-trudeau-does-press-ups-for-invictus-games-video\" title=\"\">one-armed</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/may/03/this-is-how-canada-brings-it-justin-trudeau-does-press-ups-for-invictus-games-video\" title=\"\"> push-up</a> \u2013 was morally eviscerated over four-hours of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/27/canada-trudeau-snc-lavalin-jody-wilson-raybould\" title=\"\">astonishing testimony</a> by his own former attorney general and justice minister, Jody Wilson-Raybould \u2013 a woman of great integrity and a rare Indigenous Canadian cabinet minister.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/01/explained-the-case-that-could-bring-down-canadas-justin-trudeau\">Explained: the case that could bring down Canada's Justin Trudeau</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/01/explained-the-case-that-could-bring-down-canadas-justin-trudeau\" title=\"\">recap</a>, Wilson-Raybould was demoted to the position of veterans affairs minister in a cabinet shuffle earlier this year. Shortly thereafter, reports emerged that she and her staff had been subjected to a \u201csustained\u201d campaign by the prime minister\u2019s office over the handling of corruption charges against SNC-Lavalin, a Montreal-based engineering giant accused of bribing Libyan officials. It happens to be a large employer in Quebec, Trudeau\u2019s home province \u2013 the prime minister\u2019s office made sure to remind her of that, the job losses such charges might cause and the fact that it was an election year. There was a string of increasingly irate calls, texts and emails. Still, Wilson-Raybould held her ground. The prime minister lost the battle. Then she was demoted.</p> <p>When the story broke, Trudeau denied any connection between the standoff and Raybould-Wilson\u2019s political punishment. He denied having done anything inappropriate or wrong. The press and public howled. His principal secretary, Gerald Butts, who has been his bestie since their halcyon days in the 90s at McGill University, tried to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/19/justin-trudeaus-top-adviser-resigns-as-political-meddling-scandal-widens\" title=\"\">take one for the team</a> by resigning last week. But it was already too late. Now, Canada\u2019s Tory opposition and many respected commentators are calling for Trudeau\u2019s resignation. It\u2019s a political bloodbath, Canadian style.</p> <p>For anyone familiar with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-thick-of-it\" title=\"\">The Thick of It</a> this might seem odd. In Britain, it is normal for party enforcers to rudely and aggressively pressure cabinet ministers. Delivering irate speeches along the lines of \u201cDo my master\u2019s bidding or I will personally tear your fucking skin off and wear it as a cape\u201d is essentially their whole job.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/27/canada-jody-wilson-raybould-scandal-justin-trudeau\">The pioneering ex-minister at the centre of a Canadian scandal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But in this case, it\u2019s complicated by Raybould-Wilson\u2019s role as attorney general, a position that is meant to sit above the fray of partisan politics. The decision she made was, legally speaking, entirely her own to make. If her testimony \u2013 based on copious meeting notes as well as emails and text messages \u2013 proves true, Trudeau\u2019s behaviour was way beyond the bounds of what was fair or decent. It was sleazy, plain and simple. And for a leader whose entire brand identity, right down to the toes of his cotton rainbow socks, is based on fairness and decency, that\u2019s pure political poison.</p> <p>So it\u2019s been a bad week for Canadian Liberals, and indeed for \u201csmall l\u201d liberals everywhere. For those of us who earnestly and passionately believed in Trudeau\u2019s project (*slowly raises hand*), his moral disgrace is a bitter pill to swallow. The leader we believed to be special and unique has seemingly behaved in ways that reveal him to be probably not all that. Meet the new boss, same as the old boss. Except for the fact the old boss \u2013 Stephen Harper \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/15/stephen-harper-master-manipulator\" title=\"\">ruled the country for nearly a decade</a> like a vindictive autocrat, stonewalling the press, overhauling the elections act to his benefit, ignoring climate change and proroguing parliament at a whim. Not that this excuses Trudeau, of course. </p> <p>There\u2019s no need for despair quite yet \u2013 even with the social media outrage. It\u2019s important to remember that Trudeau\u2019s scandal does not cancel out the importance of his government\u2019s project. With any luck a majority of Canadians remain unshaken in the values of liberal democracy, fair governance and the international rules-based order. Come September, my country will, I hope, find a way to persist in its sunny ways and set a clear moral example in this fractious, uncertain world.</p> <p>The message is still good and clear and true. Too bad about the chap in charge of selling it.</p> <p>\u2022 Leah McLaren is a Canadian freelance journalist and novelist based in London</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 2 March 2019.

          "bodyText": "For Canadian liberals, or indeed any of us who cling to outdated ideas such as good governance and liberal democratic values, it was like watching a unicorn get flattened by a lorry. Earlier this week, Canada\u2019s undeniably gorgeous, halo-bound Liberal prime minister, Justin Trudeau \u2013 proud feminist, defender of minority rights, advocate for transparency, inclusivity and decency, and prince of the one-armed push-up \u2013 was morally eviscerated over four-hours of astonishing testimony by his own former attorney general and justice minister, Jody Wilson-Raybould \u2013 a woman of great integrity and a rare Indigenous Canadian cabinet minister. To recap, Wilson-Raybould was demoted to the position of veterans affairs minister in a cabinet shuffle earlier this year. Shortly thereafter, reports emerged that she and her staff had been subjected to a \u201csustained\u201d campaign by the prime minister\u2019s office over the handling of corruption charges against SNC-Lavalin, a Montreal-based engineering giant accused of bribing Libyan officials. It happens to be a large employer in Quebec, Trudeau\u2019s home province \u2013 the prime minister\u2019s office made sure to remind her of that, the job losses such charges might cause and the fact that it was an election year. There was a string of increasingly irate calls, texts and emails. Still, Wilson-Raybould held her ground. The prime minister lost the battle. Then she was demoted. When the story broke, Trudeau denied any connection between the standoff and Raybould-Wilson\u2019s political punishment. He denied having done anything inappropriate or wrong. The press and public howled. His principal secretary, Gerald Butts, who has been his bestie since their halcyon days in the 90s at McGill University, tried to take one for the team by resigning last week. But it was already too late. Now, Canada\u2019s Tory opposition and many respected commentators are calling for Trudeau\u2019s resignation. It\u2019s a political bloodbath, Canadian style. For anyone familiar with The Thick of It this might seem odd. In Britain, it is normal for party enforcers to rudely and aggressively pressure cabinet ministers. Delivering irate speeches along the lines of \u201cDo my master\u2019s bidding or I will personally tear your fucking skin off and wear it as a cape\u201d is essentially their whole job. But in this case, it\u2019s complicated by Raybould-Wilson\u2019s role as attorney general, a position that is meant to sit above the fray of partisan politics. The decision she made was, legally speaking, entirely her own to make. If her testimony \u2013 based on copious meeting notes as well as emails and text messages \u2013 proves true, Trudeau\u2019s behaviour was way beyond the bounds of what was fair or decent. It was sleazy, plain and simple. And for a leader whose entire brand identity, right down to the toes of his cotton rainbow socks, is based on fairness and decency, that\u2019s pure political poison. So it\u2019s been a bad week for Canadian Liberals, and indeed for \u201csmall l\u201d liberals everywhere. For those of us who earnestly and passionately believed in Trudeau\u2019s project (*slowly raises hand*), his moral disgrace is a bitter pill to swallow. The leader we believed to be special and unique has seemingly behaved in ways that reveal him to be probably not all that. Meet the new boss, same as the old boss. Except for the fact the old boss \u2013 Stephen Harper \u2013 ruled the country for nearly a decade like a vindictive autocrat, stonewalling the press, overhauling the elections act to his benefit, ignoring climate change and proroguing parliament at a whim. Not that this excuses Trudeau, of course. There\u2019s no need for despair quite yet \u2013 even with the social media outrage. It\u2019s important to remember that Trudeau\u2019s scandal does not cancel out the importance of his government\u2019s project. With any luck a majority of Canadians remain unshaken in the values of liberal democracy, fair governance and the international rules-based order. Come September, my country will, I hope, find a way to persist in its sunny ways and set a clear moral example in this fractious, uncertain world. The message is still good and clear and true. Too bad about the chap in charge of selling it. \u2022 Leah McLaren is a Canadian freelance journalist and novelist based in London \u2022 This article was amended on 2 March 2019.

She also told parliamentarians she suspected her refusal to back down lay behind her move to the Veterans\u2019 Affairs portfolio in a mid-January cabinet reshuffle. What does Trudeau say? Trudeau has not denied that he and his team spoke to Wilson-Raybould and her staff about SNC-Lavalin. He says all of their discussions were respectful and within the bounds of the rules. On Thursday, he reiterated his belief that as prime minister, it is his job and duty to protect the jobs of Canadians \u2013 likely a reference to the potential for job losses in the event of a conviction. Is it a big deal? The leader of the opposition, Andrew Scheer, has called on Trudeau to resign \u2013something Trudeau has rejected. Other political leaders have called for more investigations into the affair \u2013 and the country\u2019s ethics commissioner is investigating. But at the justice committee hearing on Wednesday, members of Trudeau\u2019s Liberal party appeared as unified; there have been no high-profile shows of public support for Wilson-Raybould within the party since Wednesday. What is local media saying? On Thursday, Wilson-Raybould\u2019s testimony was on the front page of every major paper in the country, with most running large, dramatic photos of the defiant former attorney general. \u201cI Said \u2018No\u2019, My Mind Had Been Made Up,\u201d said the National Post. \u201cWilson-Raybould Speaks Her Truth,\u201d said the Toronto Star. \u201cWilson-Raybould points accusing finger at PM,\u201d said the Vancouver Sun. And the Globe and Mail, which broke the story, ran with the headline: \u201cAn effort to politically interfere.\u201d What happens next? A number of figures have requested to testify before the justice committee, including Gerald Butts, Trudeau\u2019s former adviser and Michael Wernick, the country\u2019s top public servant. Both were present in many of the discussions \u2013 and both have publicly stated previously they did nothing wrong. The prime minister has also said he would consider the future of Wilson-Raybould in the party. While the scandal will likely not damage him in Quebec, where his support of SNC-Lavalin is viewed positively, it could prove damaging in the rest of the country. \u2022 This article was amended on 4 March 2018 to include a reference to Wilson-Raybould\u2019s change of cabinet portfolio.",

On Wednesday, Wilson-Raybould highlighted the extent to which she alleges the prime minister\u2019s closest aides \u201chounded\u201d her in order to secure a politically beneficial outcome for the party \u2013 and Trudeau himself.

There had been some hope, however, that the meeting in Vietnam might lead to a declaration that the Korean war is finally over. \u2018Great leader\u2019.

Cohen allegations portend legal and political peril for Trump During more than seven hours of explosive testimony before the House oversight committee on Wednesday, the lawyer, fixer and convicted felon Michael Cohen dropped a series of bombshells with the potential to sink the Trump presidency.

Ed Pilkington breaks down the significant moments from Cohen\u2019s testimony, which included the revelation that the southern district of New York is still pursuing further, as-yet-undisclosed lines of inquiry into Trump\u2019s affairs. NRA faces \u2018growing storm\u2019 as House passes gun legislation The House of Representatives has passed its first major piece of gun legislation for almost a quarter of a century, approving by 240 votes to 190 a measure requiring federal background checks for all firearms sales. While the bill is unlikely to be taken up by a Republican-controlled Senate, it is a symbolic victory for gun control campaigners \u2013 and another blow for the National Rifle Association, which is facing a series of regulatory and financial problems as well as political opposition. Campaign spending. Despite Trump\u2019s full support for the NRA, which spent record amounts supporting his election in 2016, the organisation\u2019s revenue has fallen in the last two years. Its spending on the 2018 midterms was $9.4m, roughly a third of the $27m it spent during the 2014 cycle. Crib sheet A Gallup poll measuring global opinion has found the US almost neck and neck with Russia for the first time in terms of confidence in their international leadership, with both countries lagging behind China. Justin Trudeau has dismissed calls for him to resign after his former attorney general accused the Canadian prime minister\u2019s officials of a sustained effort to dissuade her from prosecuting a major engineering company accused of bribery. Pakistan has agreed to release the captured Indian fighter pilot as a \u201cpeace gesture\u201d after he was seized when his plane was shot down amid rising hostilities between the two nuclear-armed neighbours over the disputed Kashmir region. The EU has accused Facebook of repeatedly withholding data detailing its supposed efforts to combat online disinformation ahead of this year\u2019s European elections.

Lars Eriksen invited Dunn to his house in Copenhagen to show him what Dunn calls \u201cthe jungle of everyday life\u201d. How American violence brought about the border wall Anti-migrant violence on the US-Mexico border has been rife since at least the 1970s, from the brutality of the KKK\u2019s informal \u201cborder watch\u201d to the often sadistic tactics of the official border patrol. Trump\u2019s rhetoric has thrown fuel on the fire, writes Greg Grandin. An unlikely champion offers hope for the Everglades The Florida Everglades are facing devastation thanks to a combination of climate change and human development. But now conservationists have an unlikely ally: the state\u2019s new Republican governor, Ron DeSantis. Oliver Milman reports from Islamorada. China: the world\u2019s concrete superpower China pours more concrete in two years than the US did in the whole 20th century. The Three Gorges dam and Beijing Daxing airport are just two reasons why China is today\u2019s concrete superpower. Amy Hawkins reports from Beijing for the Guardian\u2019s Concrete Week series. Opinion Republicans obviously think they\u2019re helping the president by publicly trashing his former lawyer. But Michael Cohen\u2019s loyalty to Trump eventually cost him everything, says Richard Wolffe \u2013 and it will cost his congressional defenders dearly, too. Trump\u2019s loyalists in the House seemed to think that was the end of the story. Who could believe a proven liar like Michael Cohen? The only snag is that he was lying on behalf of his client, one Donald Trump. So the more they talked about his lies, the more he talked about his lying client.

          "bodyText": "Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau has rejected calls to resign over a scandal that is engulfing his administration, saying he and his staff always acted properly and that Canadians will get to have their say on the matter at the federal election in October. His comments came after Canada\u2019s former minister of justice and attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould described a consistent, sustained and inappropriate effort by senior officials close to the prime minister who were attempting to dissuade her from prosecuting a Canadian engineering company accused of bribery. In searing testimony to the justice committee on Wednesday, Wilson-Raybould said the pressure on her included \u201cveiled threats\u201d if she did not acquiesce. \u201cI experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in my role as the attorney general of Canada in an inappropriate effort,\u201d she said in her opening statement. Wilson-Raybould\u2019s appearance before the committee marked her first public comments on the scandal, which has become the biggest crisis of Trudeau\u2019s administration. In early February, the Globe and Mail reported that aides close to the prime minister had lobbied Wilson-Raybould to abandon plans to prosecute Quebec-based engineering company SNC Lavalin over accusations of fraud and bribery. Instead, they requested she pursue a \u201cdeferred prosecution agreement\u201d, which allowed the company to pay a fine.

She characterized the discussions as \u201ctreading on dangerous ground\u201d. Last week, Wernick told the same committee that no improper pressure was applied to Wilson-Raybould.

Wilson-Raybould refused to abandon the prosecution, and four months later, she was abruptly demoted to the position of veteran affairs minister \u2013 a move which she saw as a direct consequence. \u201cI can\u2019t help but think this ha[d] something to do with a decision I would not take,\u201d she told the committee. Following her demotion, she had \u201cthoughts of the Saturday Night Massacre,\u201d Wilson-Raybould testified, in a reference to Richard Nixon\u2019s purge of US justice department officials during the Watergate scandal. Under growing pressure, Trudeau denied that his office had \u201cdirected\u201d Wilson-Raybould, and said her presence in his cabinet was proof of their amicable relationship. She resigned hours later and retained the former supreme court justice Thomas Cromwell as her counsel. Opinion polls show the allegations are starting to hurt the Liberals ahead of what looks set to be a tightly contested federal election against the official opposition Conservative party in October. Opposition lawmakers accuse Trudeau of trying to cover up an attempt by officials to help SNC-Lavalin, which could be banned from bidding for federal contracts for a decade if found guilty. \u201cJustin Trudeau can no longer hide the fact that he was at the center of an attempt to interfere in a criminal prosecution. He must come clean with Canadians,\u201d Conservative leader Andrew Scheer said on Wednesday before the testimony. Scheer called on Trudeau to stand down and demanded a police inquiry. \u201cHe can no longer, with a clear conscience, continue to lead this nation,\u201d he said. The scandal has already cost Trudeau his closest adviser: Gerald Butts resigned earlier this month, but denied he had or others had improperly pressured Wilson-Raybould. \u201cWhat I hear today should make Canadians upset,\u201d Murray Rankin, a member of the New Democratic party, told Wilson-Raybould during the committee hearing. Wilson-Raybould was granted a partial waiver of solicitor-client privilege in order to testify on Wednesday, but remains unable to speak about the content of her communications with Trudeau. Wilson-Raybould, a Kwakwaka\u2019wakw lawyer from British Columbia, was Canada\u2019s first indigenous attorney general, and her inclusion in the cabinet was initially seen as proof of Trudeau\u2019s attempt to reset its relationship with indigenous peoples. \u201cI was taught to always hold true to your core values, principles and to act with integrity,\u201d said Wilson-Raybould at the conclusion of her statement. \u201cI come from a long line of matriarchs and I am a truth-teller in accordance with the laws and traditions of our big house.

Wilson tells Trudeau that both of his daughters want to become lawyers \u2013 and even prime minister. The audience \u2013 and Trudeau \u2013 laugh. Thirty-six years later, one of those daughters has become the central figure in a scandal which continues to inflict political damage on Justin Trudeau and his government. Jody Wilson-Raybould, who was the country\u2019s first indigenous attorney general and minister of justice, is scheduled to testify on Wednesday in front of parliament\u2019s justice committee, speaking publicly for the first time on allegations that the prime minister\u2019s closest aides improperly pressured her to abandon fraud and bribery prosecutions for a large Canadian engineering firm. Many believe that her refusal to acquiesce cost her a job. Those who know Wilson-Raybould, a lawyer from British Columbia, see a person who doesn\u2019t shy away from her principles.

Grand Chief Stewart Phillip of the Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs described Wilson-Raybould as a \u201cwoman of integrity and principle\u201d for the work she did for indigenous communities as an elected region chief. When Wilson-Raybould was given two of the highest positions in the country \u2013minister of justice and attorney general \u2013 the feeling was \u201cabsolutely incredible\u201d for the family, said Kory Wilson. \u201cThat was the first time that an indigenous voice would be represented at that highest level. Does that mean that things will happen and change overnight? No, of course not. But the potential was there and the hope was there.\u201d Trudeau\u2019s decision to bring a well-respected indigenous lawyer into Ottawa\u2019s inner circle was seen as proof that his government was attempting to reset its relationship with indigenous peoples \u2013 and also bring credibility to his administration. A photo of Wilson-Raybould embracing Trudeau in the House of Commons quickly became emblematic of the perceived shift in tone towards indigenous peoples. But the honeymoon period between Canada\u2019s indigenous people and the Trudeau government slowly shifted to a more confrontational relationship; despite the fanfare around his government\u2019s plan to overhaul the country\u2019s relationship with indigenous peoples, the legislation has been abandoned and is unlikely to become law. Meanwhile, although Wilson-Raybould won plaudits for her commitment to reconciliation efforts, she has also come under criticism for a handful of legal decisions which critics believe will have problematic implications in years to come. Civil rights groups say the drunk driving and cannabis laws introduced by her office disproportionately target ethnic minorities. Still, her demotion from the post came as a surprise to many. \u201cWhen Jody was kicked in the teeth by the prime minister, and shuffled down to veterans affairs, as important as it is, that was a clear slap in the face for all Indians across the country,\u201d her father told the CBC, calling his daughter \u201ca woman of integrity\u201d.

She was also featured in editorial cartoons that were widely panned as racist and sexist \u2013 which the prime minister subsequently condemned. Throughout the affair, she has remained silent and resisted becoming a foil for opposition parties seeking to capitalize on the feud with the prime minister. That will change on Wednesday afternoon, when she is slated to deliver a 30-minute opening statement to the justice committee \u2013 three times longer than is normal. So far, the prime minister appears determined to weather the self-inflicted storm, but those who know Wilson-Raybould believe he may have picked the wrong battle. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt about it, he picked a fight with the wrong individual,\u201d Grand Chief Phillip said. \u201cShe\u2019s a force to be reckoned with.\u201d",

The authorities said it was \u201cnot targeted at members of the public but was for security purpose\u201d and called on voters to turn out en masse. \u201cThere\u2019s no attack on any part of Maiduguri and hence no threat to public peace and order,\u201d a police spokesman said. Some Maiduguri residents questioned why the security forces would choose to hold an unannounced, fear-inducing drill only a few hours before polls opened. Thousands of people who have fled Boko Haram over the past few years and who are living in camps in Maiduguri turned out to vote despite the gunfire. \u201cWe need maximum security in the camp to enable us to cast our votes peacefully,\u201d said Ibrahim Jalomi, an internally displaced person from Baga town. He appealed to the armed forces to provide extra protection against Boko Haram attacks. \u201cThe explosions caused panic among us displaced people but it is not enough to dampen our enthusiasm to vote,\u201d said Ya\u2019mallam Garba. Ibrahim Usman, who also voted in Maiduguri, said his elation at being able to take part in the election was almost destroyed by the failure of the smart card readers at his polling station in Abbaganaram primary school. The readers, and the permanent voter cards they are used with, were introduced in 2015 to accredit voters. \u201cIt delays the process, and can you believe that it took the wisdom of the party agents to agree to the use of manual ways?\u201d Usman said. His frustrations were echoed by Aisha Sani, a housewife at the nearby Mafoni polling station, who said: \u201cI thought that INEC used the extra one week to put everything in order. Why the excuse with sensitive equipment? Is it deliberate?\u201d Buhari won the last election with a promise to deal with mushrooming insecurity and official corruption, but he has not made as much progress as his party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), claims on these fronts. Many hope his chief rival Atiku, as the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP)\u2019s candidate is known, will at least shore up a struggling economy and create jobs. The result is expected to be close. In Nigeria\u2019s southern megacity of Lagos, young people woke early and braved drizzle to vote for their candidates, including those outside the establishment. \u201cThey [Atiku and Buhari] are both terrible people and not fit to be president,\u201d said Oluchi Nzeadibe, 29, an advertising executive who got to her polling station at Ebute Metta just before 8am to avoid the long queues and vote for the former deputy central bank governor Kingsley Moghalu. \u201cI don\u2019t think Atiku will bring any real change if he wins. And all the \u2018experience and leadership\u2019 they\u2019ve sold us at all levels, what has it brought us really? This old bunch needs to go. Let\u2019s have a Justin Trudeau for once, a younger person. I\u2019m voting Moghalu because he\u2019s different and hasn\u2019t been in power before.\u201d Voters reported APC and PDP agents had sought out voters at polling stations and offered financial inducements. Fatoye Oluwaseyi, a lawyer had to dismiss agents from both parties who approached him with 5,000 naira (\u00a310). He told them he had made the decision to vote out Buhari\u2019s administration a year ago. He said he was voting against the ruling party because it was inept and had shown \u201cbrazen disregard for the rule of law\u201d.",

Long seen as the \u201cconscience\u201d of the country\u2019s political system, the party increasingly has to compete against the Liberals to its right \u2013 and the Green party to its left. But Smith isn\u2019t convinced the party\u2019s prospects are dire. \u201cOver my adult life, the NDP has grown much stronger everywhere across the country,\u201d he said, calling it a \u201cmuch more sophisticated political machine\u201d than it was even a decade ago. He sees Singh as a deeply capable, charismatic leader \u2013 pointing to his ability to drive high turnout in key races \u2013 and his ability to flip regions, like the Toronto suburbs, to the NDP. For Smith, there is little to fret over in the upcoming byelection: \u201cHe was always going to win in Burnaby \u2026 This is a guy who is very warm, likeable, engaging and knowledgeable.\u201d Monday\u2019s test will be politically existential for Singh: as he canvasses neighbourhoods, party members have said Singh\u2019s continued leadership is unlikely if he fails to win.",

The line between being a teller of tales and the subject of an obituary can be thinner than one might like.)</p> <p>Such is everyday life, particularly during October and November, in this small town on the shores of Canada\u2019s Hudson Bay. A little more than 1,000 miles north of the provincial capital of Winnipeg, Churchill is not just remote, it is defiantly so, accessible overland only by rail, its residents bonded by the conjoined challenges of living on the fringes of the Arctic and sharing their streets with the largest land carnivore in the world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d794b1251086b2d34e6ce1fa3d7f825b3cff66b8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d794b1251086b2d34e6ce1fa3d7f825b3cff66b8/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aerial view of Churchill, Manitoba, Canada.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aerial view of Churchill, Manitoba, Canada.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: All Canada Photos/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIf you were to build a town today, you would never put it here,\u201d explains Geoff York of Polar Bears International, a research and advocacy organization whose members, understandably, spend much time in Churchill each year. \u201cPolar bears are creatures of the sea ice, and they come ashore in the summer here when the sea ice on Hudson Bay melts and then they wait for the ice to return.\u201d That return tends to begin sometime in November; by October, the bears are already stirring, wandering in anticipation toward the bay along a route that takes them past, and sometimes directly through, Churchill.</p> <p>From a cold war peak of about 5,000 people, when it hosted a military base, Churchill is now home to roughly 900 year-round inhabitants, slightly more than half of whom are Native. Theirs can be a harsh and at times tenuous existence, one that is leavened by the income from tourists who come to gaze at the northern lights in the winter, paddle among the hundreds of belugas that throng the river in summer and, in October and November, visit the polar bear capital of the world.</p> <p>Polar bears have made Churchill famous, and led to it being dubbed the <a href=\"https://globalnews.ca/news/3982336/tourism-industry-in-churchill-taking-hit-since-rail-line-wash-out-last-spring/\">\u201cjewel of Manitoba\u201d</a> and one of the <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/canada/places-of-a-lifetime/\">top destinations in Canada</a>. But as it emerges from the most testing two years in its modern history, Churchill may be about to embark on an entirely different path, as this frequently frigid community considers embracing a warmer future.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"dee5781d6675daadac154409f95faabbfc671baa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dee5781d6675daadac154409f95faabbfc671baa/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tour groups view polar bears along the Hudson Bay on a cloudy autumn morning.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tour groups view polar bears along the Hudson Bay on a cloudy autumn morning.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Souders/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p>It is estimated that about 10,000 people descend upon Churchill annually during the five- or six-week \u201cbear season\u201d. The bulk of bear viewing takes place on the tundra outside of town, from the safety of bespoke vehicles approximately the size of school buses atop airport fire truck wheels, the immense size of which enables the trucks to traverse treacherous terrain and keep their occupants beyond the reach of even the largest and most curious bear.</p> <p>The challenge for Churchill residents is to encourage the bears to head to the tundra without tarrying in town. In the past, the policy was less one of deterrence than immediate destruction. \u201cWhen I was growing up, it was common for conservation officers to shoot 25 bears a season,\u201d explains the mayor, Mike Spence, who is of Cree and Scottish descent. These days, the community, in conjunction with the Manitoba department of conservation, employs a different approach: the Polar Bear Alert Program.</p> <p>Signs around the town remind residents and visitors alike to exercise caution and report bear sightings on the hotline \u2013 675-BEAR. Culvert traps, baited with seal scent, line the perimeter of the community; bears that are caught in them are taken to a holding facility, popularly known as the polar bear jail, where they are held for up to 30 days (without food, to enhance the deterrence factor of the experience), before being drugged and helicoptered to a spot safely away from town \u2013 or, if late enough in the season, on to the sea ice.</p> <p>If a bear does make it past the perimeter defense and into town conservation officers\u2019 first plan is to help it on its way, motivating it to leave by firing cracker shells (loud, blank shotgun shells) and following it with vehicles. Only the recalcitrant and the repeat offenders are incarcerated.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"43395dd881e564e5dd6c18b59d3327d9e35767ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/43395dd881e564e5dd6c18b59d3327d9e35767ca/0_0_5415_3610/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A polar bear at a car window in Churchill, Canada.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A polar bear at a car window in Churchill, Canada.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Konrad Wothe/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For residents, living with polar bears is an unavoidable fact of life, and one that instils an understandable caution. As one former resident once said to me with a chuckle: \u201cIn Winnipeg, they say you can tell when someone is from Churchill because they always look carefully before walking around a corner.\u201d</p> <p>House and vehicle doors are always unlocked, should anyone need to fling one open and leap to shelter. As much as they can, residents simply avoid peak bear sites \u2013 anywhere along the coast or the riverbanks, in the willows on the edge of town, alleyways \u2013 especially at night, and particularly during peak bear season. For some, however, that isn\u2019t always an option. Parker Fitzpatrick works for Manitoba Hydro, the provincial utility company, and if a line is down, he and his team have to repair it, no matter when and where. As a result, they exercise due caution.</p> <p>\u201cYou try your hardest to not put yourself in that predicament,\u201d he explains. \u201cBut if you have to go out in an area that\u2019s a bad area or where bears have been spotted, and there\u2019s a line down, I always get resources: set up security fences, for example, and carry shotguns with cracker shells. Ninety per cent of bears won\u2019t bother you at all, but there are some who are hungry or are curious and want to bat you around like a baseball.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Since the establishment of the Polar Bear Alert Program in 1983, serious attacks have been rare. There has been just one fatality, during the program\u2019s first season: a homeless man, Tommy Mutanen, was rummaging through the freezer of a fire-damaged motel, stuffing meat into his pockets, when he rounded a corner and bumped into a bear. Nearby residents heard his screams, but although they rushed to his aid, they could not make the bear stop his attack, and by the time they shot it, Mutanen was dead.</p> <p>There has, however, been one exceptionally close shave.</p> <p>Erin Greene first arrived in Churchill from her native Montreal in 2012; she planned to spend a few months working at a local restaurant and then go back home, but she liked it so much she returned to stay the following summer.</p> <p>\u201cAnd then,\u201d she said, \u201cI got mauled by a polar bear.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9404fd3fa80243dce0966e11b4ab0079875bc30d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9404fd3fa80243dce0966e11b4ab0079875bc30d/0_0_3602_2279/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One of many polar bear alert warning signs posted inside the town of Churchill, Manitoba.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"633\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of many polar bear alert warning signs posted inside the town of Churchill, Manitoba.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul J Richards/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On Halloween night 2013, Greene and two friends were walking home in the early hours from a party when, <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/radio/nowornever/churchill-faces-a-now-or-never-moment-1.4356798/my-friends-and-family-think-i-m-crazy-that-i-still-live-here-after-being-attacked-by-a-bear-1.4362723\">she later recalled</a>: \u201cWe all looked and there was a polar bear that was barreling down the street, just running towards us. Our first instinct was to run.\u201d</p> <p>Her friends escaped, but the bear caught Greene and grabbed her by the head and shoulders, tearing off part of her scalp as it tossed her around like a rag doll. As blood poured down her body, Erin was convinced she was going to die, and she might well have done, had it not been for a 69-year-old man with a shovel named Bill Ayotte.</p> <p>Ayotte heard Greene\u2019s screams and, clad only in a sweater and his pyjamas, ran toward the scene and brought his shovel down as hard as he could between the bear\u2019s eyes.</p> <p>The bear dropped Greene, who scrambled toward the safety of Ayotte\u2019s house, and turned its attention to Ayotte instead, tearing off an ear and clamping down on a leg. Other residents arrived, firing cracker shells and, ultimately, driving at the bear with headlights flashing and horn blazing, sending it off.</p> <p>Greene and Ayotte were airlifted to Winnipeg. Greene\u2019s scalp was repaired; Ayotte\u2019s ear was reattached. Both spent weeks recuperating in the hospital; both returned to Churchill.</p> <p>Today, Greene teaches yoga in the community; during bear season, she works at a gift shop and, in the summer months, leads <a href=\"http://www.sup-north.com/about\">stand</a><a href=\"http://www.sup-north.com/about\">up-paddleboard tours on</a> to the river when the belugas are at their peak.</p> <p>She could not, I suggest, have been blamed had she elected not to return to the scene of such an ordeal.</p> <p>\u201cI was trying to heal myself from the trauma I had experienced, and I believe that facing it head on is the way to do it,\u201d she said. Besides, the community had helped pay her medical bills; she could hardly abandon them. \u201cKnowing that this community produced someone who would risk their life to save another person\u2019s, I definitely wanted to be somewhere where humans turned out like that.\u201d</p> <p>The sense of community, of a populace that bonds together and looks out for each other, is a common theme among residents. It was both tested and strengthened over the last two years, when the very viability of Churchill was threatened as never before.</p> <p>It all began with the largest blizzard anyone could recall.</p> <h2>* * *</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5e043ee4da3159a3d0d6ec4f01e7f4b68d6e1897\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e043ee4da3159a3d0d6ec4f01e7f4b68d6e1897/0_0_3141_1962/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A member of the RCMP watches for polar bears at the Cape Merry National Historic Site in ChurchillA member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police watches for polar bears at the Cape Merry National Historic Site in Churchill, Manitoba August 23, 2010 during a visit by Canada\u2019s Prime Minister Stephen Harper.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"625\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A member of the RCMP watches for polar bears at the Cape Merry national historic site in Churchill.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Wattie/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The blizzard began on 7 March 2017 and lasted for 57 hours.

So, we dug this tunnel up and sent Max up there. He had to lay down on the top of the snow pile, because he couldn\u2019t stand up [because of the wind], and shovel until [Sandra\u2019s husband] Kevin could get out. Then Kevin and Max went out and started shoveling out others. People were looking out across the street, looking out for neighbors. The whole community came together. Our streets were like tunnels. It was an extraordinary amount of snow.\u201d</p> <p>The response to the blizzard, said Cook, \u201cbrought out the best in people\u201d. But the community would face a bigger challenge two months later, one that stretched it to the limit.</p> <p>The snow melted.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"15e5d157e02daf0396c4c301193e3cda913bcd99\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/15e5d157e02daf0396c4c301193e3cda913bcd99/0_0_4096_2731/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Polar Bear walks on the frozen tundra next to Hudson Bay ahead of the freeze-over 12 November 2007 outside Churchill, Mantioba, Canada.

An engineering study found 20 washouts and damage in 130 places. The estimated repair bill was $43.5m. OmniTrax, the Colorado-based company that owned the track and which was already looking for a way to offload it, said it couldn\u2019t afford to foot the repairs and wouldn\u2019t. The federal government took the company to court. And Churchill found itself effectively isolated.</p> <p>A week without the train became a month. A month became two, then three, then six, then 18.</p> <p>With no road connection to the outside world, the only way out for residents was a $1,200 round-trip air ticket that few could afford. Everything that the town needed \u2013 every nail and screw, every can of beer, every pallet of produce \u2013 had to be flown in at exorbitant cost. Residents found themselves with far less cash on hand.

          "bodyText": "Spend enough time in Churchill, and you will hear the stories. Of hearing a noise outside, pulling open the drapes and seeing a polar bear looking in through the window. Of walking around a corner at night, coming face-to-face with a bear and, implausibly, scaring it off with the strobe light on a cellphone. Of encountering an old man with a walker, determinedly clacking past a puzzled bear that peered at him from behind a rock and muttering defiantly: \u201cIf it gets me, it gets me.\u201d Of being about to, against all better judgment, walk the couple of hundred yards from restaurant to hotel room at night, only to be pulled back by a warning that a pair of polar bears had been spotted across the street. (OK, the last story is mine. The line between being a teller of tales and the subject of an obituary can be thinner than one might like.) Such is everyday life, particularly during October and November, in this small town on the shores of Canada\u2019s Hudson Bay. A little more than 1,000 miles north of the provincial capital of Winnipeg, Churchill is not just remote, it is defiantly so, accessible overland only by rail, its residents bonded by the conjoined challenges of living on the fringes of the Arctic and sharing their streets with the largest land carnivore in the world. \u201cIf you were to build a town today, you would never put it here,\u201d explains Geoff York of Polar Bears International, a research and advocacy organization whose members, understandably, spend much time in Churchill each year. \u201cPolar bears are creatures of the sea ice, and they come ashore in the summer here when the sea ice on Hudson Bay melts and then they wait for the ice to return.\u201d That return tends to begin sometime in November; by October, the bears are already stirring, wandering in anticipation toward the bay along a route that takes them past, and sometimes directly through, Churchill. From a cold war peak of about 5,000 people, when it hosted a military base, Churchill is now home to roughly 900 year-round inhabitants, slightly more than half of whom are Native. Theirs can be a harsh and at times tenuous existence, one that is leavened by the income from tourists who come to gaze at the northern lights in the winter, paddle among the hundreds of belugas that throng the river in summer and, in October and November, visit the polar bear capital of the world. Polar bears have made Churchill famous, and led to it being dubbed the \u201cjewel of Manitoba\u201d and one of the top destinations in Canada. But as it emerges from the most testing two years in its modern history, Churchill may be about to embark on an entirely different path, as this frequently frigid community considers embracing a warmer future. * * * It is estimated that about 10,000 people descend upon Churchill annually during the five- or six-week \u201cbear season\u201d. The bulk of bear viewing takes place on the tundra outside of town, from the safety of bespoke vehicles approximately the size of school buses atop airport fire truck wheels, the immense size of which enables the trucks to traverse treacherous terrain and keep their occupants beyond the reach of even the largest and most curious bear. The challenge for Churchill residents is to encourage the bears to head to the tundra without tarrying in town. In the past, the policy was less one of deterrence than immediate destruction. \u201cWhen I was growing up, it was common for conservation officers to shoot 25 bears a season,\u201d explains the mayor, Mike Spence, who is of Cree and Scottish descent. These days, the community, in conjunction with the Manitoba department of conservation, employs a different approach: the Polar Bear Alert Program. Signs around the town remind residents and visitors alike to exercise caution and report bear sightings on the hotline \u2013 675-BEAR. Culvert traps, baited with seal scent, line the perimeter of the community; bears that are caught in them are taken to a holding facility, popularly known as the polar bear jail, where they are held for up to 30 days (without food, to enhance the deterrence factor of the experience), before being drugged and helicoptered to a spot safely away from town \u2013 or, if late enough in the season, on to the sea ice. If a bear does make it past the perimeter defense and into town conservation officers\u2019 first plan is to help it on its way, motivating it to leave by firing cracker shells (loud, blank shotgun shells) and following it with vehicles. Only the recalcitrant and the repeat offenders are incarcerated. For residents, living with polar bears is an unavoidable fact of life, and one that instils an understandable caution. As one former resident once said to me with a chuckle: \u201cIn Winnipeg, they say you can tell when someone is from Churchill because they always look carefully before walking around a corner.\u201d House and vehicle doors are always unlocked, should anyone need to fling one open and leap to shelter. As much as they can, residents simply avoid peak bear sites \u2013 anywhere along the coast or the riverbanks, in the willows on the edge of town, alleyways \u2013 especially at night, and particularly during peak bear season. For some, however, that isn\u2019t always an option. Parker Fitzpatrick works for Manitoba Hydro, the provincial utility company, and if a line is down, he and his team have to repair it, no matter when and where. As a result, they exercise due caution. \u201cYou try your hardest to not put yourself in that predicament,\u201d he explains. \u201cBut if you have to go out in an area that\u2019s a bad area or where bears have been spotted, and there\u2019s a line down, I always get resources: set up security fences, for example, and carry shotguns with cracker shells. Ninety per cent of bears won\u2019t bother you at all, but there are some who are hungry or are curious and want to bat you around like a baseball.\u201d * * * Since the establishment of the Polar Bear Alert Program in 1983, serious attacks have been rare. There has been just one fatality, during the program\u2019s first season: a homeless man, Tommy Mutanen, was rummaging through the freezer of a fire-damaged motel, stuffing meat into his pockets, when he rounded a corner and bumped into a bear. Nearby residents heard his screams, but although they rushed to his aid, they could not make the bear stop his attack, and by the time they shot it, Mutanen was dead. There has, however, been one exceptionally close shave. Erin Greene first arrived in Churchill from her native Montreal in 2012; she planned to spend a few months working at a local restaurant and then go back home, but she liked it so much she returned to stay the following summer. \u201cAnd then,\u201d she said, \u201cI got mauled by a polar bear.\u201d On Halloween night 2013, Greene and two friends were walking home in the early hours from a party when, she later recalled: \u201cWe all looked and there was a polar bear that was barreling down the street, just running towards us. Our first instinct was to run.\u201d Her friends escaped, but the bear caught Greene and grabbed her by the head and shoulders, tearing off part of her scalp as it tossed her around like a rag doll. As blood poured down her body, Erin was convinced she was going to die, and she might well have done, had it not been for a 69-year-old man with a shovel named Bill Ayotte. Ayotte heard Greene\u2019s screams and, clad only in a sweater and his pyjamas, ran toward the scene and brought his shovel down as hard as he could between the bear\u2019s eyes. The bear dropped Greene, who scrambled toward the safety of Ayotte\u2019s house, and turned its attention to Ayotte instead, tearing off an ear and clamping down on a leg. Other residents arrived, firing cracker shells and, ultimately, driving at the bear with headlights flashing and horn blazing, sending it off. Greene and Ayotte were airlifted to Winnipeg. Greene\u2019s scalp was repaired; Ayotte\u2019s ear was reattached. Both spent weeks recuperating in the hospital; both returned to Churchill. Today, Greene teaches yoga in the community; during bear season, she works at a gift shop and, in the summer months, leads standup-paddleboard tours on to the river when the belugas are at their peak. She could not, I suggest, have been blamed had she elected not to return to the scene of such an ordeal. \u201cI was trying to heal myself from the trauma I had experienced, and I believe that facing it head on is the way to do it,\u201d she said. Besides, the community had helped pay her medical bills; she could hardly abandon them. \u201cKnowing that this community produced someone who would risk their life to save another person\u2019s, I definitely wanted to be somewhere where humans turned out like that.\u201d The sense of community, of a populace that bonds together and looks out for each other, is a common theme among residents. It was both tested and strengthened over the last two years, when the very viability of Churchill was threatened as never before. It all began with the largest blizzard anyone could recall. * * * The blizzard began on 7 March 2017 and lasted for 57 hours. As the snow fell, it was driven by 120 km/h winds into massive drifts. By the time it was over, drifts in some places were 25 to 30 feet high; \u201chuge stretches\u201d of roads were buried under eight to nine feet of snow. \u201cWe had to tunnel out of our house, tunnel up and out,\u201d recalls Sandra Cook, a local artist. \u201cMy son Max was 13 at the time, so we figured he was the strongest and the thinnest. So, we dug this tunnel up and sent Max up there. He had to lay down on the top of the snow pile, because he couldn\u2019t stand up [because of the wind], and shovel until [Sandra\u2019s husband] Kevin could get out. Then Kevin and Max went out and started shoveling out others. People were looking out across the street, looking out for neighbors. The whole community came together. Our streets were like tunnels. It was an extraordinary amount of snow.\u201d The response to the blizzard, said Cook, \u201cbrought out the best in people\u201d. But the community would face a bigger challenge two months later, one that stretched it to the limit. The snow melted. The melt caused massive flooding which, among other things, damaged the final 249km stretch of the railway track connecting Churchill to Winnipeg and thus the world. An engineering study found 20 washouts and damage in 130 places. The estimated repair bill was $43.5m. OmniTrax, the Colorado-based company that owned the track and which was already looking for a way to offload it, said it couldn\u2019t afford to foot the repairs and wouldn\u2019t. The federal government took the company to court. And Churchill found itself effectively isolated. A week without the train became a month. A month became two, then three, then six, then 18. With no road connection to the outside world, the only way out for residents was a $1,200 round-trip air ticket that few could afford. Everything that the town needed \u2013 every nail and screw, every can of beer, every pallet of produce \u2013 had to be flown in at exorbitant cost. Residents found themselves with far less cash on hand. Business at some stores in town dropped 90%. The hit to the community was not just financial. \u201cThere are kids in this town who haven\u2019t seen their grandparents for a year and nine months,\u201d said Dave Daley, a M\u00e9tis community leader and owner of a dog mushing company that caters to tourists. \u201cA lot of families constantly go back and forth; there\u2019s been none of that.\u201d The school hockey team had to content itself with practice, because there was no way for them to travel and compete. For some, the uncertain future was too tenuous to risk staying. \u201cI think there were 40 less kids in the school last year,\u201d said Daley. \u201cThere were some people struggling with addiction, some families breaking apart,\u201d said Cook. \u201cWe had a spurt of crime, which is normally very low here.\u201d The impasse was finally broken when a consortium of industry and First Nations communities banded together as the Arctic Gateway Group to buy the rail track and the port in late August. Repairs to the rail line began almost immediately, and on 31 October last year, the still of the Churchill night was pierced, for the first time in 18 months, by the whistle of an approaching train. \u201cPeople were just stunned,\u201d recalls Cook. \u201cI was handing out Halloween candy and I suddenly thought, \u2018What am I hearing?\u2019 The smiles plastered on people\u2019s faces were unbelievable.\u201d The following day, the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, flew into town to formally announce the restoration of the railway and increased funding to improve the line and repair and redevelop the port. A street party celebrated the start of a new chapter. On the deck of the Seaport Hotel, owned by Spence, a sign declared: \u201cThe hostages are free.\u201d But with new beginnings come new challenges, and as it emerges from its darkest hour, Churchill finds itself at a crossroads. \u201cI think there\u2019s a bright future for us,\u201d asserts Daley. \u201cBut we have to be careful: we don\u2019t want Churchill to lose its identity. I don\u2019t want a road here. The minute we get a road here, we lose our identity and who we are.\u201d * * * Even without a road, that identity may ultimately face a reckoning. The challenge isn\u2019t posed by a renovated railway, but by the prospect of a refurbished and revitalized port, the decrepit husk of which looms over the town. In the past, the port regularly exported grain and provided diesel fuel to remote Nunavut communities, but the new owners have a much grander vision: of links to Europe and India and the possible export of oil and gas. \u201cA few years ago, OmniTrax raised the prospect of shipping oil through the community, and unequivocally the community was resolutely against doing so for a number of reasons, the biggest one being that the shipping industry at the time was ill-equipped to deal with the prospect of accidents or disasters,\u201d said John Gunter of Frontiers North Adventures, one of the premier ecotourism companies in town. \u201cSo, it looks like we\u2019ll have to deal with that prospect again in the future.\u201d Of course, for a port in an Arctic environment to become truly viable, it will require shipping lanes that aren\u2019t clogged with ice much of the year; and so Churchill may ultimately find itself as both the most famous home of the ultimate icon of climate change and a community that, in the words of Spence, \u201cwill have to take advantage\u201d of that warming climate. \u201cThe Northwest Passage offers a 7,000km shortcut from New Jersey to Shanghai,\u201d Murad al-Katib, CEO of Arctic Gateway, said at the railway reopening ceremony. \u201cChurchill is the only commercial deep-water port in northern Canada, and climate change has extended the shipping season.\u201d It is a view cautiously echoed by many in town, even as they express anxiety about not losing what makes Churchill unique. \u201cI\u2019m not against oil, because I think it can be done safely,\u201d said Daley. \u201cWith global warming and the strait open more often, I think there\u2019s a market for it.
