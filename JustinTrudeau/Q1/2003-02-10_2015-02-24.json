The overriding action of EU leaders should be to recognise that the eastern, largely Russian-speaking, Ukrainians have the right to determine their own form of governance.</p> <p>All Ukrainians have been let down by their leaders, who have failed to address poverty and corruption. Ukraine has been dependent upon Russian loans and aid, primarily in the form of low-priced oil and gas, essential for the people\u2019s survival in winter; it is Russia that has saved them from even greater hardship.

Vladimir Putin is no angel.

A vast majority of Crimeans have recently said so. Crimea is vitally important to Russia, being its historic outlet to the Black Sea.</p> <p>Opinion seems to be more divided in Ukraine. The only sane solution would be a fair vote, and, if the west wants to go one way and the east the other, they should be allowed to do so.

          "bodyText": "In the dead of winter, the last thing on most Canadians\u2019 minds is the prospect of another federal election. The official deadline for this year\u2019s vote \u2013 19 October \u2013 is still a long way off, and there are more immediate worries in this G7 nation of 35 million people: the struggling economy, the drop in value of Alberta oil, the fast-sinking Canadian dollar, security scares over home-grown Islamist radicals, the war in Iraq and Canada\u2019s military role there. But it\u2019s precisely those and other everyday worries \u2013 and the fact that the country\u2019s Conservative government could use them to distract from its own stumbles and scandals as it seeks a fifth mandate into a new decade in power \u2013 that suggest an election could happen sooner than later. There could be a snap vote as early as April, after the budget. And when the writ is dropped, expect a hard-fought, three-way race. Prime minister Stephen Harper and his Tories have governed Canada since 2006. For their first two terms, they held on to power precariously as a minority government, but were boosted to a solid majority (166 of 308 seats) after the last nationwide vote in 2011. That run could be coming to an end, however, for a number of reasons, one of which is the unexpected resurgence of the third-running (but for most of its history, governing) Liberal party. Justin Trudeau became leader of the Liberals two years ago, vowing to reverse their dismal showing in the last election, when they won only 34 seats. A 43-year-old political neophyte, he offers youth, good looks and a pedigree as the eldest son of the late Pierre Trudeau, Canada\u2019s most famous prime minister, who was in charge from 1968-79 and 1980-84. Though faulted for his inexperience, Justin Trudeau polls well, with the Grits now neck-and-neck with the Tories at about 33% of the vote. And while he\u2019s raised a few eyebrows with some of his pet policies (he favours legalising marijuana, for example), he has avoided controversy with others (he doesn\u2019t want to dictate energy policy to the provinces, for example, as his father did.) To Trudeau\u2019s left, politically, but trying to steer closer to the centre to appeal to Canada\u2019s large middle class, is another fluently bilingual Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. The New Democratic party\u2019s Thomas Mulcair doesn\u2019t have Trudeau\u2019s charm but does excel as a debater and orator.

Mulcair\u2019s power base is heavily concentrated in Quebec, however (54 seats, out of 95 nationwide), and is ripe for picking by Trudeau\u2019s Liberals. Another weakening factor for the governing party: the NDP and the Liberals have been quick to capitalise on the Harper government\u2019s scandals. Chief among them: illegal \u201crobocalls\u201d in Ontario in the 2011 election that misled voters on where to vote (a junior Tory staffer was found guilty) and allegations of fraudulent expense claims by Tory senators that came to light in 2012 (the first criminal trial is set to begin in April). The Tories have also been in the line of opposition fire for underestimating the cost of replacing Canada\u2019s fighter-jet fleet, tainted meat scandals that followed the gutting of Canada\u2019s food-inspection agency, and a dismal environmental record on pollution and climate change.

          "body": "<p><strong>In 2014 a record 1.5 billion people voted in the more than 100 elections held around the world. This year UK voters aren\u2019t the only ones electing a new government; one third of EU member states will go to the polls, and with important elections due in Asia, Africa and the Americas, the significance of this year\u2019s ballots will be felt around the world.</strong></p> <p><strong>Here are the 15 elections \u2013 more or less in chronological order \u2013 to watch out for in 2015:</strong></p> <h2>Sri Lanka</h2> <p>Mahinda Rajapaksa faces the toughest challenge of his long political career as Sri Lanka prepares for a crucial presidential election today. The key question is whether the common opposition candidate, Maithripala Sirisena, can cut significantly into Rajapaksa\u2019s strong rural base among the majority Sinhala community. He already seems to have lost the Tamil and Muslim vote, and has been weakened by the defections of several members of parliament and aides, including Sirisena himself. Sirisena is backed by former president Chandrika Kumaratunga and several opposition parties. <strong>Maseeh Rahman</strong></p> <h2>Greece</h2> <p>Following the Hellenic parliament\u2019s failure to select a new president at the end of last year, early elections have been called for 25 January. Having topped last year\u2019s European parliament elections, the leftwing and anti-austerity party Syriza is ahead in the polls. Syriza wants to renegotiate the terms of Greece\u2019s bailout deal. Many analysts believe the election, which outgoing prime minister Antonis Samaras of the centre-right party New Democracy has described as a referendum on Europe, could drag the eurozone back into a crisis. While Syriza is likely to emerge as the largest party, it is unclear if its leader, Alexis Tsipras, will have the numbers needed to form a government. <strong>Alberto Nardelli</strong></p> <h2>Nigeria</h2> <p>In February, Nigeria\u2019s president, Goodluck Jonathan, heads to what will be the closest-fought elections since military rule ended in 1999. His rival Muhammadu Buhari is seen as having the best shot to dislodge the Jonathan-led People\u2019s Democratic party, which has been in power for the past 15 years. But a likely presidential runoff could trigger sectarian bloodshed in Africa\u2019s most populous country, where Islamists Boko Haram are entrenched in the north-east, while militants control oilfields located in the Christian-majority south. <strong>Monica Mark</strong></p> <h2>Israel</h2> <p>Israel holds general elections on 17 March after prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu\u2019s rightwing coalition \u2013 elected in 2013 \u2013 became increasingly unviable and he called snap elections late last year. Israel\u2019s political system \u2013 with many small parties often serving particular interests \u2013 has tended to frequently create short-lived governments. In a so far close-run campaign that has already been unusually bitter, amid allegations of corruption involving former Netanyahu\u2019s ally and foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman\u2019s party \u2013 Netanyahu\u2019s rightwing Likud is running neck and neck with the centre/centre-left union of Isaac Herzog\u2019s Labour party and Tzipi Livni\u2019s Hatnua. Despite various realignments and a general public weariness with Netanyahu (above), a rightwing coalition led by him and including Naftali Bennett\u2019s far-right Jewish Home and the ultra-orthodox parties still seems more likely to emerge victorious. <strong>Peter Beaumont</strong></p> <h2><br>Canada</h2> <p>A showdown looms between Conservative pro-big oil prime minister Stephen Harper and Justin Trudeau, the new leader of the Liberals, who is the son of former prime minister Pierre Trudeau. While opposition left-leaning NDP leader Thomas Mulcair (right) has been praised for doggedly holding Harper to account on issues such as the Keystone XL pipeline and election fraud allegations, he has been unable to build on gains made in the 2011 elections. Harper will be touting his record on foreign affairs \u2013 he has intervened militarily in the Afghanistan and Isis conflicts \u2013 and the economy. Canada is on track to reducing the national deficit \u2013 though the free fall in oil prices is bound to eventually have a negative impact. Harper will use negative advertising to undermine Trudeau\u2019s attempt to portray himself as a leader-in-waiting. Voter turnout will play an important role \u2013 the last election saw the second lowest turnout in a century. <strong>Sian Griffiths</strong></p> <h2>Turkey</h2> <p>The Turkish leader, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, hopes to use parliamentary elections this year to push through radical constitutional changes and entrench himself in power, possibly until the centenary of the republic in 2023. Currently president, after three terms as prime minister, and still the leading figure of the ruling Justice and Development \u2013 or AK \u2013 party, Erdo\u011fan will be hoping for a 330 majority in the 550-seat parliament in the general election in June. The threshold would enable him to push through the constitutional changes needed to turn Turkey into a presidential system. The election will shape the Turkish political landscape well beyond the next four years. Few pundits call into question another AKP victory; all attention will be on its scale. The stakes are high as if the AKP does manage to secure required majority, and to change the constitution with a popular referendum, Erdogan would further secure his role as the country\u2019s undisputed strongman. <strong>Constanze Letsch</strong></p> <h2>Sudan</h2> <p>President Omar al-Bashir (right), wanted by the international criminal court, is widely expected to extend his 25-year rule in elections due to start on 13 April. His National Congress party remains all-pervasive, while the opposition are calling for a delay to allow political reforms. Ghazi Salahuddin Atabani, a former adviser to Bashir, has set up a new party, Reform Now, but could boycott the poll. Fadlallah Burma Nasir, vice-president of the Umma party, which refused to contest the last vote in 2010, said: \u201cWe are not going to elections if things continue as they are.\u201d Another empty Bashir victory could fuel the potential for revolt amid economic doldrums and high youth employment. <strong>David Smith</strong></p> <h2>Tanzania</h2> <p>A new president is guaranteed in east Africa\u2019s second biggest economy as Jakaya Kikwete steps down after his second five-year term. Prime minister Mizengo Pinda is the frontrunner but could be derailed after being implicated in an energy scandal that resulted in the plunder of more than $120m (\u00a376.5m) from the country\u2019s central bank. Four main opposition parties have agreed to work together in the October election but are unlikely to end half a century of dominance by the governing Chama Cha Mapinduzi. The winner will inherit a gas boom but Robert Besseling, principal analyst at IHS Country Risk, predicts: \u201cAllegations of corruption, rising prices for staples and fuel, and persistent power shortages are likely to increase the opposition\u2019s support - and have triggered riots in major cities in the past.\u201d <strong>DS</strong></p> <h2>Denmark</h2> <p>Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt, right, will be calling an election before mid-September. The prime minister, who came to power in 2011 at the helm of a centre-left coalition of Social Democrats, Social Liberals and the Socialist People\u2019s party, is currently trailing in the polls by about eight points. But a critical factor will be how much support the rightwing Danish People\u2019s party garners on election day and the influence it will have on any future government\u2019s policies, especially when it comes to on immigration. The party, which at last year\u2019s EU elections became the largest party for the first time in a nationwide Danish election, is currently locked in a three-horse race atop Danish polls with the Social Democrats and the centre-right Liberal party. Could Denmark follow in the footsteps of Sweden, where the strength of the far-right Sweden Democrats led to an unlikely deal between the Socialists and the centre-right coalition in order to avert repeat elections? <strong>AN</strong></p> <h2>Poland</h2> <p>The EU\u2019s sixth largest country will be heading to the polls before the end of October. The country\u2019s two main parties, the centre-right Civic Platform (which is seeking re-election under prime minister Ewa Kopacz) and the conservative Law and Justice (PiS), are currently locked in a dead heat, but like elsewhere in Europe, the arithmetic of possible coalitions is unclear. In local elections held at the end of last year, viewed as a dress rehearsal ahead of this year\u2019s parliamentary vote, PiS came just ahead of Civic Platform (26.85% v 26.36%), but the governing party won eight more seats and retained control of 15 out of 16 assemblies. <strong>AN</strong></p> <h2>Argentina </h2> <p>Change is in store for Argentina, where elections will be held in October this year. President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, who took office in 2007, is ineligible to stand in elections this October. She is thought to be grooming her son to become a future president, but he is not expected to stand this time around. Contenders to replace her in the top job include Peronists Daniel Scioli and Sergio Massa, as well as Mauricio Macri, mayor of Buenos Aires and leader of the centre-right party Propuesta Republicana. Much is at stake, with Argentina mired in a deep economic crisis. The next president will inherit an economy that defaulted on its debts for a second time in 13 years in 2014, driving the peso sharply lower. Inflation is sky-high around 40%, and the economy is shrinking. <strong>Angela Monaghan</strong></p> <h2>Belarus</h2> <p>Alexander Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus since 1994, is likely to be elected for another five-year term in presidential elections due before November. With an iron grip on the security services and media, there is little chance of \u201cEurope\u2019s last dictator\u201d being ousted at the ballot box. The country\u2019s marginalised and demoralised opposition forces will have to decide whether to boycott the vote or attempt to unite around a single opposition candidate. After Lukashenko\u2019s last win in 2010, seven opposition candidates were arrested and street protests were quickly and violently crushed. Lukashenko was given 80% of the vote; European observers described the ballot as a farce. <strong>Shaun Walker</strong></p> <h2><br>Uzbekistan</h2> <p>Perhaps the most ruthless and unpleasant of all the central Asian dictatorships, Uzbekistan will hold a presidential vote on 29 March. Islam Karimov (left), the country\u2019s leader since independence from the Soviet Union, is now 76 and has looked tired and ill in his few public appearances. He has not yet said he will definitely run again, though everyone expects him to. With absolutely no dissent tolerated, he will win easily. However, if Karimov\u2019s illness is serious, the election period could be a dangerous and rocky time. There are signs of a vicious power struggle behind the scenes, with the president\u2019s daughter Gulnara under house arrest for months on end and a behind-the-scenes clan battle in full swing. <strong>SW</strong></p> <h2>Saudi Arabia</h2> <p>Elections are not looming large in Saudi Arabia in 2015. The conservative kingdom is an absolute monarchy with no political parties to make demands about how to distribute the income from the world\u2019s second largest oil reserves. But this year will again see a vote for some local councils, though their powers are very limited. The big news is that Saudi women, who are still banned from driving, will be able to both vote and run for office for the first time following a promise by King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz in 2011. <strong>Ian Black</strong></p> <h2>Spain</h2> <p>The country\u2019s two main parties, the opposition Socialists (PSOE) and the governing People\u2019s Party (PP), won nearly 75% of the vote at the last general election in 2011.This was also pretty much the lower-end of the combined PSOE-PP support in all previous elections held since the 1990s after the People\u2019s Alliance was re-founded as the People\u2019s Party. In several of these elections the combined score of the two parties was above 80%. This year will be very different. The parties combined are now polling below 55%. The main threat to Madrid\u2019s traditional two-party balance comes from Podemos, a leftwing movement founded at the beginning of 2014, which won 8% of the vote in last May\u2019s EU elections, and is now polling in line with Spain\u2019s two historic political forces. In a country governed by one or the other of the main parties, the biggest question mark over the Spanish election will be around the type of government that will emerge from the polls if neither PP or PSOE capture an outright majority. As a backdrop to all this, calls for a Catalan independence vote are ringing louder. All eyes are currently focused on Greece, but the real deal in EU elections this year may end up being Spain. <strong>AN</strong></p>",

          "bodyText": "In 2014 a record 1.5 billion people voted in the more than 100 elections held around the world. This year UK voters aren\u2019t the only ones electing a new government; one third of EU member states will go to the polls, and with important elections due in Asia, Africa and the Americas, the significance of this year\u2019s ballots will be felt around the world. Here are the 15 elections \u2013 more or less in chronological order \u2013 to watch out for in 2015: Sri Lanka Mahinda Rajapaksa faces the toughest challenge of his long political career as Sri Lanka prepares for a crucial presidential election today. The key question is whether the common opposition candidate, Maithripala Sirisena, can cut significantly into Rajapaksa\u2019s strong rural base among the majority Sinhala community. He already seems to have lost the Tamil and Muslim vote, and has been weakened by the defections of several members of parliament and aides, including Sirisena himself. Sirisena is backed by former president Chandrika Kumaratunga and several opposition parties. Maseeh Rahman Greece Following the Hellenic parliament\u2019s failure to select a new president at the end of last year, early elections have been called for 25 January. Having topped last year\u2019s European parliament elections, the leftwing and anti-austerity party Syriza is ahead in the polls. Syriza wants to renegotiate the terms of Greece\u2019s bailout deal. Many analysts believe the election, which outgoing prime minister Antonis Samaras of the centre-right party New Democracy has described as a referendum on Europe, could drag the eurozone back into a crisis. While Syriza is likely to emerge as the largest party, it is unclear if its leader, Alexis Tsipras, will have the numbers needed to form a government. Alberto Nardelli Nigeria In February, Nigeria\u2019s president, Goodluck Jonathan, heads to what will be the closest-fought elections since military rule ended in 1999. His rival Muhammadu Buhari is seen as having the best shot to dislodge the Jonathan-led People\u2019s Democratic party, which has been in power for the past 15 years. But a likely presidential runoff could trigger sectarian bloodshed in Africa\u2019s most populous country, where Islamists Boko Haram are entrenched in the north-east, while militants control oilfields located in the Christian-majority south. Monica Mark Israel Israel holds general elections on 17 March after prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu\u2019s rightwing coalition \u2013 elected in 2013 \u2013 became increasingly unviable and he called snap elections late last year. Israel\u2019s political system \u2013 with many small parties often serving particular interests \u2013 has tended to frequently create short-lived governments. In a so far close-run campaign that has already been unusually bitter, amid allegations of corruption involving former Netanyahu\u2019s ally and foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman\u2019s party \u2013 Netanyahu\u2019s rightwing Likud is running neck and neck with the centre/centre-left union of Isaac Herzog\u2019s Labour party and Tzipi Livni\u2019s Hatnua.

When the guns fired in tribute to the fallen soldiers, they all jumped.</p> <p>They had come a long way to hear it. They were from Holy Trinity high school in Torbay, Newfoundland, and had gone to Ottawa on a field trip as part of their social studies class, studying concepts of Canadian identity. The focus of the trip was the Remembrance Day celebrations.</p> <p>They could not have come at a more meaningful moment for Canada. </p> <p>The National War Memorial in Ottawa was first dedicated in May 1939 \u2013 just a few months before Canada joined Britain and France in declaring war on Nazi Germany.</p> <p>And on Tuesday, as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2014/nov/11/canada-veterans-ottawa-remembrance-day-deadly-shooting-in-pictures\">80,000 people gathered in Canada</a>\u2019s capital for Remembrance Day \u2013 the largest crowd by far to gather there since the memorial\u2019s first dedication \u2013 the solemn moment was also haunted by the spectre of a more recent violence.</p> <p>In October, Corporal Nathan Cirillo, a Canadian soldier standing guard at the memorial, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/22/canadian-parliament-hill-lockdown-shootout\">was shot and killed by a gunman</a> who then attacked the parliament building. The day before, Warrant Officer Patrice Vincent was also murdered in a hit and run attack.</p> <p>Security was much higher than in previous years; police with dogs stood on corners, and riflemen stood guard on rooftops. But the terrible events of the past few weeks have inspired, as well as horror, a renewed sense of pride and resilience in the nation. The Royal Canadian Legion reported that more than 19m poppies, the symbol of remembrance, had been sold this year - more than in any previous year.<br></p> <p>One of Hammond\u2019s students, Olivia Nesbitt, 14, said she found the idea that Cirillo could have been murdered on Canadian soil \u201cvery scary\u201d at first. She said she thought nothing like that could happen there. \u201cBut then I realised war is all over the world, and something like this can happen somewhere near you.\u201d<br></p> <p>Jack Combden, 14, another of the students from Hammond\u2019s class, said that the day had been a sombre one. \u201cBut at the same time, it was celebrating,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really gives you a chance to remember how lucky you are.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dec64ed09432bbce414062e87716307deffc7260\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/11/1415738408750/c727b78a-587f-4335-a539-e2757cd44cbf-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Princess Ann\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Princess Anne walks past the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, during Tuesday\u2019s Remembrance Day ceremony in Ottawa. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Carroccetto/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rabbi Reuven Bulka, giving the benediction, said Canada had always been a peace-loving nation, but that it now found itself right in the eye of the terror storm. </p> <p>\u201cOur sacred space, this sacred space \u2026 has been violated,\u201d he said. \u201cYet it remains a sacred space \u2013 perhaps even more so.

          "bodyText": "Walter Hammond\u2019s class of students had never heard a howitzer salute before. When the guns fired in tribute to the fallen soldiers, they all jumped. They had come a long way to hear it. They were from Holy Trinity high school in Torbay, Newfoundland, and had gone to Ottawa on a field trip as part of their social studies class, studying concepts of Canadian identity. The focus of the trip was the Remembrance Day celebrations. They could not have come at a more meaningful moment for Canada. The National War Memorial in Ottawa was first dedicated in May 1939 \u2013 just a few months before Canada joined Britain and France in declaring war on Nazi Germany. And on Tuesday, as 80,000 people gathered in Canada\u2019s capital for Remembrance Day \u2013 the largest crowd by far to gather there since the memorial\u2019s first dedication \u2013 the solemn moment was also haunted by the spectre of a more recent violence. In October, Corporal Nathan Cirillo, a Canadian soldier standing guard at the memorial, was shot and killed by a gunman who then attacked the parliament building. The day before, Warrant Officer Patrice Vincent was also murdered in a hit and run attack. Security was much higher than in previous years; police with dogs stood on corners, and riflemen stood guard on rooftops. But the terrible events of the past few weeks have inspired, as well as horror, a renewed sense of pride and resilience in the nation. The Royal Canadian Legion reported that more than 19m poppies, the symbol of remembrance, had been sold this year - more than in any previous year. One of Hammond\u2019s students, Olivia Nesbitt, 14, said she found the idea that Cirillo could have been murdered on Canadian soil \u201cvery scary\u201d at first. She said she thought nothing like that could happen there. \u201cBut then I realised war is all over the world, and something like this can happen somewhere near you.\u201d Jack Combden, 14, another of the students from Hammond\u2019s class, said that the day had been a sombre one. \u201cBut at the same time, it was celebrating,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really gives you a chance to remember how lucky you are.\u201d Rabbi Reuven Bulka, giving the benediction, said Canada had always been a peace-loving nation, but that it now found itself right in the eye of the terror storm. \u201cOur sacred space, this sacred space \u2026 has been violated,\u201d he said. \u201cYet it remains a sacred space \u2013 perhaps even more so. What was before a vivid symbol of the precious blood spilled to preserve our freedom, is now and forever a place where real blood was spilled.\u201d As the sun shone brightly in a cloudless sky, Princess Anne read a message from the Queen, and Canada\u2019s governor general spoke, as well as Prime Minister Stephen Harper and the Liberal party leader, Justin Trudeau. Chris Markevich, a student at the University of Ottawa, watched the parade from across the street from the east block of the parliament building. He said that he thought the ceremony was bringing people together. \u201cIt\u2019s a show of solidarity, a show of respect for the two gentlemen that lost their lives, as well as the overall feeling of remembrance.\u201d He said it was about coming together as a city and as a nation. \u201cThe reason people are here \u2013 the reason I\u2019m here \u2013 is to honour their memories, and never forget why this day exists. Jamie Bresolin, a lieutenant in the Canadian navy, was also there for the ceremony. He told the Guardian that it was the largest turnout he had ever seen for the Remembrance Day service, and one that \u201cseemed to provide a little closure to all that\u2019s happened in the last few weeks here\u201d. He said that while the ceremony was a big deal every year, this year there was definitely an sense of something more. \u201cA little bit of everything; sadness and pride at the same time.\u201d Hammond, for whom this is the second time bringing students on this trip, said that the class had had a really powerful experience.

The list includes Homeland, Boardwalk Empire, House of Cards, Breaking Bad, Downton Abbey, Mad Men and The Wire, his very favorite show. At a state dinner in February, Obama approached HBO's chief executive to request advance episodes of Game of Thrones and True Detective. (To be fair, he's also really into SportsCenter.)<br></p> <p>Arch-conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh has even <a href=\"http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2014/02/18/total_lawlessness_a_disastrous_economy_and_cbs_asks_obama_about_what_he_s_watching_on_tv\">accused</a> the president of watching too much TV. I suspect that like more of us than would care to admit, the leader of the free world doesn\u2019t actually have time to watch all the quality programming with which he professes to keep up. But wouldn\u2019t that only make him more relatable to the premium cable-subscribing, recap-skimming members of his support base?</p> <h2><strong>The royal family</strong></h2> <p>For Her Majesty, it's an entirely different ballgame. For one thing, she\u2019s an 88-year-old great-grandmother, and for another, she doesn't have an election coming up. According to the <a href=\"http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2013-06-07/what-are-the-queens-favourite-tv-shows\">Radio Times</a>, the Queen loves EastEnders, Coronation Street, Keeping Up Appearances, Last of the Summer Wine and Doctor Who (rumour <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/queen-secret-dr-who-fan-551390\">holds</a> that her favorite Doctor is Christopher Eccleston). It is also <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/60-amazing-queen-facts-you-661023\">said</a> that the Queen had a soft spot for Telly Savalas\u2019 Kojak.</p> <p>In late June, she and the Duke of Edinburgh <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/06/24/queen-elizabeth-s-game-of-thrones.html\">toured</a> the Belfast studio where much of Game of Thrones is filmed. The Queen\u2019s staff politely neglected to mention whether she actually watches the wildly popular (and wildly graphic) HBO series, which, frankly, is ample evidence that she doesn't \u2013 almost as ample as the fact that she declined to sit on the Iron Throne. (As for the Queen\u2019s Guard, that\u2019s a <a href=\"http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20836355,00.html\">different</a> story.) The very next day, she and Philip visited the set of the BBC\u2019s Antiques Roadshow, favorite of grandparents worldwide, at Hillsborough Castle.

Perhaps that memorable incident \u2013 and Dubya\u2019s general reputation as something less than the smartest guy around the conference table \u2013 is part of the reason Bush generally <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/30/us/obamas-tv-picks-anything-edgy-with-hints-of-reality.html?_r=1&amp;\">downplays</a> his TV-watching habits.</p> <p>That said, during his 2004 campaign, Bush <a href=\"http://www.azcentral.com/news/election/articles/campgn04-bush.html\">owned up to</a> watching A&amp;E\u2019s Biography and \u2013 unsurprisingly, as a former owner of the Texas Rangers \u2013 baseball. </p> <p>As for the appetites of other commanders in chief, FDR <a href=\"http://magazine.foxnews.com/celebrity/presidents-and-their-favorite-tv-shows\">favored</a> Mickey Mouse cartoons and former actor Ronald Reagan enjoyed Family Ties so much he offered to appear on the show.

He <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/the-pope/9903482/Benedict-spends-first-night-as-Pope-Emeritus-watching-TV.html\">reportedly</a> spent the first hours of his retirement enjoying the TV coverage of his departure from the Vatican.</p> <p>Pope Francis has elected to live elsewhere, in a <a href=\"http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/02/130328-pope-francis-vatican-casa-santa-marta-apartment-rome-catholic/\">relatively austere</a> hotel suite at the Vatican\u2019s Casa Santa Marta residence \u2013 it\u2019s unclear what the TV situation is over there, but my gut is that, if there is one, it\u2019s far from state of the art.</p> <h2><strong><strong>Joe Biden</strong></strong></h2> <p>America's wacky uncle has expressed his fondness for Parks and Recreation \u2013 on which he <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvbMB_GGR6s\">guest-starred </a>as himself \u2013 and Modern Family, but he's also <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/11/joe-biden-weighs-in-on-honey-boo-boo-quite-a-phenomenon/\">admitted</a> to watching \"snippets\" of the exuberantly trashy Toddlers &amp; Tiaras spinoff Here Comes Honey Boo Boo on Air Force Two. (Sure, Joe. \"Snippets.\") This isn\u2019t entirely out of character, if only because Biden\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=104700772\">gregarious</a>, freewheeling persona is the closest thing the White House has to a reality TV star.</p> <p>Modern Family comes up frequently when American politicians talk TV. The ABC sitcom has been cited as a favorite by not only Biden and the Obamas, but also by the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, <a href=\"http://www.tvguide.com/news/mitt-romney-favorite-shows-1055308.aspx\">Mitt Romney</a>, and his wife Ann. Why? It\u2019s a perfect centrist cipher. The series is both consistently highly rated and critically acclaimed \u2013 it has racked up 18 Primetime Emmy Awards since its 2009 debut.

          "bodyText": "All hail the golden age of television, in which complex series like The Sopranos and The Wire have been crowned (by some) as the new novels, and the proliferation of DVRs and instant streaming services means we can watch whatever we want, whenever we want. TV is enjoying an unprecedented intellectual moment \u2013 even our presidents, prime ministers and monarchs can\u2019t help but admit they tune in. Naming your favorite TV shows is a deeply personal revelation, an act that can be both politically and culturally charged \u2013 even if you\u2019re not naming them on a global stage. So here\u2019s how more than a dozen world leaders have answered that question. Which would you rather share a sofa and a bag of popcorn with? Barack and Michelle Obama Think of a prestige TV series \u2026 any prestige TV series. Odds are that, at one time or another, Barack Obama has said he watches it. The list includes Homeland, Boardwalk Empire, House of Cards, Breaking Bad, Downton Abbey, Mad Men and The Wire, his very favorite show. At a state dinner in February, Obama approached HBO's chief executive to request advance episodes of Game of Thrones and True Detective. (To be fair, he's also really into SportsCenter.) Arch-conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh has even accused the president of watching too much TV. I suspect that like more of us than would care to admit, the leader of the free world doesn\u2019t actually have time to watch all the quality programming with which he professes to keep up. But wouldn\u2019t that only make him more relatable to the premium cable-subscribing, recap-skimming members of his support base? The royal family For Her Majesty, it's an entirely different ballgame. For one thing, she\u2019s an 88-year-old great-grandmother, and for another, she doesn't have an election coming up. According to the Radio Times, the Queen loves EastEnders, Coronation Street, Keeping Up Appearances, Last of the Summer Wine and Doctor Who (rumour holds that her favorite Doctor is Christopher Eccleston). It is also said that the Queen had a soft spot for Telly Savalas\u2019 Kojak. In late June, she and the Duke of Edinburgh toured the Belfast studio where much of Game of Thrones is filmed. The Queen\u2019s staff politely neglected to mention whether she actually watches the wildly popular (and wildly graphic) HBO series, which, frankly, is ample evidence that she doesn't \u2013 almost as ample as the fact that she declined to sit on the Iron Throne. (As for the Queen\u2019s Guard, that\u2019s a different story.) The very next day, she and Philip visited the set of the BBC\u2019s Antiques Roadshow, favorite of grandparents worldwide, at Hillsborough Castle. This time, QEII didn\u2019t bother to conceal her affection for the program, asking host Fiona Bruce when the episode featuring herself and her husband will air. In general, the royals seem less concerned about whether their TV programs are highbrow, and more that they are homegrown. The Duchess of Cornwall\u2019s favorite program is Strictly Come Dancing, while the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are apparently fans of The X Factor and Downton Abbey. David Cameron Cameron loves murder mysteries like The Killing, Case Histories, Injustice, Midsomer Murders, Silent Witness and Elementary. In fact, he loves them so much that before the joint committee on the national security strategy, in January, he claimed that detective TV shows justify the \"snooper\u2019s charter\u201d, legislation that would create a database monitoring online activity. \"I love watching, as I should probably stop telling people, crime dramas on the television,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is hardly a crime drama where a crime is solved without using the data of a mobile communications device.\u201d As far as Cameron\u2019s opponents in the 2010 general election go, Labour's Gordon Brown prefers Simon Cowell-style reality TV like The X Factor and Britain's Got Talent, while the Liberal Democrats'Nick Clegg watches Come Dine With Me. For what it\u2019s worth, current Labour leader Ed Miliband\u2019s favorite show is The West Wing, which his staffers took to quoting in strategy meetings. Tony Abbott The Australian prime minister also named Downton Abbey as his favorite show, and the \u201cDowager Duchess\u201d \u2013 by which he meant the Dowager Countess, Maggie Smith \u2013 as his favourite character. Aristocratic costume dramas are polling well in Commonwealth realms. Stephen Harper In 2011, the Canadian prime minister made a cameo appearance in Murdoch Mysteries, one of the highest-rated shows on Canadian TV. Harper \u2013 who calls the turn-of-the-century detective series his \u201cfavourite program, of what\u2019s on these days\u201d \u2013 plays a police constable who doesn\u2019t recognise the prime minister. (Get it?) \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit of irony there,\u201d Harper explains, without a hint of irony himself. Justin Trudeau, leader of Canada\u2019s Liberal party and one of Harper\u2019s chief rivals, prefers Downton Abbey. The Dalai Lama Tibet\u2019s spiritual leader has said he likes the Discovery Channel, though we suspect His Holiness \u2013 purity incarnate \u2013 is more a fan of the network\u2019s traditional documentary programming than American Chopper or Deadliest Catch. George W Bush One of President Bush\u2019s most famous in-office gaffes saw him choke on a pretzel and pass out while watching an NFL game on TV in 2002. Perhaps that memorable incident \u2013 and Dubya\u2019s general reputation as something less than the smartest guy around the conference table \u2013 is part of the reason Bush generally downplays his TV-watching habits. That said, during his 2004 campaign, Bush owned up to watching A&amp;E\u2019s Biography and \u2013 unsurprisingly, as a former owner of the Texas Rangers \u2013 baseball. As for the appetites of other commanders in chief, FDR favored Mickey Mouse cartoons and former actor Ronald Reagan enjoyed Family Ties so much he offered to appear on the show. They didn\u2019t take him up on it. Hillary and Bill Clinton Interestingly, the comments the former (and future?) first couple have made about watching TV deal mainly with watching together, emphasizing the intactness of their marriage \u2013 a PR battle the Clintons have been fighting on multiple fronts for decades. \u201cWe both love Grey's Anatomy and did our best to watch it together whenever we could before the campaign began,\u201d Bill told Time in 2007, before his wife's first tilt at the presidency. Last month, Hillary described how they \"totally binge-watched\u201d House of Cards together. While Bill is a known fan of 24 and Scandal, Madam Secretary has spoken of her love for home-improvement shows. She particularly likes Love It or List It, in which families must choose between keeping their freshly renovated home or buying a new place. New York Times columnist Gail Collins characterizes the show\u2019s appeal as \u201cClintonesque\u201d \u2013 each episode\u2019s various crises are overcome with \u201chard work\u201d, then, voil\u00e0, \u201chappy ending\u201d. Pope Benedict XVI According to Archbishop Georg G\u00e4nswein, Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI watched the evening news on a flat-screen television in the luxuriously appointed papal apartment. He reportedly spent the first hours of his retirement enjoying the TV coverage of his departure from the Vatican. Pope Francis has elected to live elsewhere, in a relatively austere hotel suite at the Vatican\u2019s Casa Santa Marta residence \u2013 it\u2019s unclear what the TV situation is over there, but my gut is that, if there is one, it\u2019s far from state of the art. Joe Biden America's wacky uncle has expressed his fondness for Parks and Recreation \u2013 on which he guest-starred as himself \u2013 and Modern Family, but he's also admitted to watching \"snippets\" of the exuberantly trashy Toddlers &amp; Tiaras spinoff Here Comes Honey Boo Boo on Air Force Two. (Sure, Joe. \"Snippets.\") This isn\u2019t entirely out of character, if only because Biden\u2019s gregarious, freewheeling persona is the closest thing the White House has to a reality TV star. Modern Family comes up frequently when American politicians talk TV. The ABC sitcom has been cited as a favorite by not only Biden and the Obamas, but also by the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, and his wife Ann. Why? It\u2019s a perfect centrist cipher. The series is both consistently highly rated and critically acclaimed \u2013 it has racked up 18 Primetime Emmy Awards since its 2009 debut. Modern Family features multiethnic families and a gay couple, yet has largely avoided controversy (among even the Romney-est viewers) by reinforcing wholesome moral values and family togetherness at every turn. Antonin Scalia Though the famously conservative supreme court justice \u201c[doesn\u2019t] even know what Homeland is\u201d, the court\u2019s longest-serving justice told New York magazine that he loves Seinfeld \u2013 which may be surprising, given that the show\u2019s ensemble of disaffected Manhattan liberals don\u2019t exactly hold traditional family values in reverence. Then again, Scalia grew up in New York City and the Soup Nazi apparently transcends party lines. \u201cIn fact, I got some CDs of Seinfeld,\u201d he said. \u201cOh, boy. The Nazi soup kitchen? No soup for you!\u201d It just goes to show you: public figures\u2019 tastes in television, be they calculated to maximize popular appeal or to express genuine preferences, are not always what you would expect. There\u2019s no one way to watch TV like a world leader \u2013 but setting your DVR to record Modern Family and Downton Abbey couldn\u2019t hurt.",

Well, take his views on cyclists: \"Every year we have dozens of people that get hit by cars or trucks. Well, no wonder: roads are built for buses, cars and trucks, not for people on bikes. My heart bleeds for them when I hear someone gets killed, but it's their own fault at the end of the day.\" He also once argued that taxpayers shouldn't be concerned about Aids because the only people who got it were gays and drug injectors, and complained that \"Oriental people\" are \"taking over\". And the people of Toronto elected him? By a record 11% margin in 2010. He's standing again next year, and has a good chance of re-election. Voters like his, er, robust anti-tax, anti-union, anti-most-things views. Most likely to say: \"I'm not perfect.\" (His excuse when he admitted having been drunk and abusive at an ice hockey match in 2006.) Least likely to say: \"It's time for us to get behind this diversity initiative.\"",

There is, undoubtedly, the possibility that popular election could create tensions with Westminster democracy: what would happen if a leader is installed by the branchmembers over the wishes of the party room? Australian uncertainty about proposals of this sort may be heightened because the only experience that most Australians have had with popularly-elected parliamentary leaders was that of the Australian Democrats in the first years of this century, when senator Natasha Stott-Despoja was popularly elected by the Democrats\u2019 branch members only to be toppled after her party-room lost confidence with her leadership.

Indeed, in the UK, all three major national parliamentary parties use some form of popular election to choose their leaders. For any Australian accustomed to snap leadership changes happening within days \u2013 or even hours \u2013 the UK experience of campaign debates, online commercials, and candidates\u2019 conference speeches is quite a shock. UK leadership battles have provided opportunities for parties to road-test their potential leaders with a form of nation-wide campaign, allowed a broader cross-section of party members and officials to have a say in policy direction, and provided parties with an opportunity for reinvention after political difficulties or election losses.

Since the time of Cameron\u2019s election in 2005, the Australian Liberals and the ALP have each had four leaders. Popular election of parliamentary leaders, it could be argued, enhances the ability of leaders to ride out rough periods, and provides a disincentive to those hoping for a quick change of leader by allowing MPs to trigger a leadership election but not to decide it exclusively or quickly on their own. Such a system may also enhance the extent to which branch members can potentially have a say in their party\u2019s direction. On the other hand, of course, it could be said that popular election can be linked to disgruntled party rooms, artificially-long leaderships for unpopular leaders, the possibility of branchstacking, and delays and interim leaders while the party organises a poll of members. (These problems, of course, already exist to some extent in Australia.) But above all, and importantly for Australian purposes, the UK experience shows that popular election of party leaders is reconcilable with Westminster parliamentary democracy, and that the Australian-style snap-spill is simply unknown in contemporary British politics.

          "body": "<p>There are few equivalents to the political power and promise associated with membership of the storied Kennedy clan. But in Canada, being the eldest son of former prime minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau comes close.</p> <p>Pierre Trudeau led the country through the years of counterculture, disco and the hottest days of the cold war, with a soft spot for socialist policies and swooning young women who often gathered for kisses and autographs.

          "bodyText": "There are few equivalents to the political power and promise associated with membership of the storied Kennedy clan. But in Canada, being the eldest son of former prime minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau comes close. Pierre Trudeau led the country through the years of counterculture, disco and the hottest days of the cold war, with a soft spot for socialist policies and swooning young women who often gathered for kisses and autographs. Under his watch, Canada decriminalised homosexuality, repatriated the constitution, enacted martial law to beat back a separatist terror cell in French-speaking Quebec, and took steps towards building what Trudeau envisioned as a \"just society\".

          "body": "<p>It might be commonplace to graft extensive sports analogies on to discussions about politics, but Saturday night in Ottawa offered a particularly special occasion. Here is what happened, in brief: two politicians stepped into a boxing ring set up in a large conference room of a hotel complex in the city's suburbs and physically beat each other for a few minutes. It was the metaphorical becoming literal. And, probably predictably, it was borderline surreal.</p> <p>There are two ways to explain the fight. The simplest explanation is that it was an effort to raise money for cancer research, which it did \u2013 some $230,000 (\u00a3144,000). More complicated, however, is articulating all of the elements of a narrative built up not just since Liberal MP <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Trudeau\" title=\"\">Justin Trudeau</a> and Conservative senator <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Brazeau\" title=\"\">Patrick Brazeau</a> decided to <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/story/2012/03/27/pol-trudeau-brazeau-fight.html\" title=\"\">face one another in the ring</a>, but over years of Liberal and Conservative political battles, ones that have in the past decade fallen heavily to the Conservatives in almost every way.</p> <p>With that in mind, the combatants probably could not have been better picked. Trudeau, 40, is the son of former prime minister Pierre Trudeau, the name held up to by those on the right as the man responsible for leading Canada into socialist backwaters until a sensible, cold-hearted Conservative came in to lower taxes, brutalise criminals, and rule like a king. On the other side was Brazeau, 37, a trash-talking, ex-military karate black belt and former aboriginal chief, appointed to the senate in 2009 \u2013 a perfect embodiment of a particularly brash, fuck-you strain of the current Conservative rhetoric.</p> <p>Then into the mix came <a href=\"http://www.sunnewsnetwork.ca/sunnews/politics/archives/2012/03/20120331-233549.html\" title=\"\">Sun TV News</a>, a sort of northern answer to Fox News. Sun TV bought the exclusive broadcast rights to the fight, and featured an endless pre-show in which its hosts promoted the rebranding of <a href=\"http://www.earthhour.org/\" title=\"\">Earth Hour</a> as <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2012/03/30/let-there-be-light-human-achievement-hour-to-coincide-with-earth-hour/\" title=\"\">Human Achievement Hour</a>, a time when people are encouraged to keep lights on.</p> <p>The network appeared almost gleeful with anticipation of the fight, and the prospect of watching Trudeau \u2013 or \"<a href=\"http://ezralevant.com/2012/02/shiny-pony-unleashed.html\" title=\"\">Shiny Pony</a>\", a reference to the flowing hair he would have to cut should he lose \u2013 go down hard. And because it was widely assumed Trudeau would be beaten, perhaps badly, by Brazeau (the latter was given three to one odds), the nation awaited the picture and caption the rightwing tabloids would carry on Sunday morning. A Liberal defeated. Again. A nation surely altered. Again, this time for good. End scene on the Grit century.</p> <p>As expected, the crowd in the windowless, concrete convention hall-turned-gala venue on Saturday seemed heavily weighted in favour of Brazeau before the fight began, with chants of his name ringing louder than those for Trudeau.

          "bodyText": "It might be commonplace to graft extensive sports analogies on to discussions about politics, but Saturday night in Ottawa offered a particularly special occasion. Here is what happened, in brief: two politicians stepped into a boxing ring set up in a large conference room of a hotel complex in the city's suburbs and physically beat each other for a few minutes. It was the metaphorical becoming literal. And, probably predictably, it was borderline surreal. There are two ways to explain the fight. The simplest explanation is that it was an effort to raise money for cancer research, which it did \u2013 some $230,000 (\u00a3144,000). More complicated, however, is articulating all of the elements of a narrative built up not just since Liberal MP Justin Trudeau and Conservative senator Patrick Brazeau decided to face one another in the ring, but over years of Liberal and Conservative political battles, ones that have in the past decade fallen heavily to the Conservatives in almost every way. With that in mind, the combatants probably could not have been better picked. Trudeau, 40, is the son of former prime minister Pierre Trudeau, the name held up to by those on the right as the man responsible for leading Canada into socialist backwaters until a sensible, cold-hearted Conservative came in to lower taxes, brutalise criminals, and rule like a king. On the other side was Brazeau, 37, a trash-talking, ex-military karate black belt and former aboriginal chief, appointed to the senate in 2009 \u2013 a perfect embodiment of a particularly brash, fuck-you strain of the current Conservative rhetoric. Then into the mix came Sun TV News, a sort of northern answer to Fox News. Sun TV bought the exclusive broadcast rights to the fight, and featured an endless pre-show in which its hosts promoted the rebranding of Earth Hour as Human Achievement Hour, a time when people are encouraged to keep lights on. The network appeared almost gleeful with anticipation of the fight, and the prospect of watching Trudeau \u2013 or \"Shiny Pony\", a reference to the flowing hair he would have to cut should he lose \u2013 go down hard. And because it was widely assumed Trudeau would be beaten, perhaps badly, by Brazeau (the latter was given three to one odds), the nation awaited the picture and caption the rightwing tabloids would carry on Sunday morning. A Liberal defeated. Again. A nation surely altered. Again, this time for good. End scene on the Grit century. As expected, the crowd in the windowless, concrete convention hall-turned-gala venue on Saturday seemed heavily weighted in favour of Brazeau before the fight began, with chants of his name ringing louder than those for Trudeau. But after the fight's first round, the anticipated script veered wildly off course. Trudeau appeared to adopt a kind of Homer Simpson style of fighting \u2013 he allowed Brazeau to hit him early and quickly, waited for his energy to run dry, and then retaliated. It worked. Trudeau gained the upper hand early in the second round, and as the tilt wore on, the result started to become clearer. Trudeau won. Not only did he win, he did it via a technical knockout, leaving Brazeau battered and exhausted against the ropes. In the end, the fight didn't even go three full rounds. By the time it was over, the \"Papineau Pugilist\", the elite centrist moderate from Montreal, handed the Conservative an unexpected, crushing loss, and his own party supporters a moment of pure catharsis. What does this all mean for Canadian politics, if anything? Likely, it will simply be a nice memory for the Liberals in the future, during what looks set to be years of rebuilding for the party \u2013 finally a point of pride in a line of undignified defeats. Some, however, have already speculated the victory will be a launching point for a Trudeau bid at Liberal party leadership. That would be odd.
