          "bodyText": "New Zealand First and the Labour party have formally signed a coalition agreement, introducing a slew of new policies focusing on climate change, regional development and poverty. On Tuesday, prime minister elect Jacinda Ardern and NZ First leader Winston Peters \u2013 who will serve as deputy prime minister and foreign affairs minister in the new government \u2013 signed a commitment in Wellington, pledging to making sure all New Zealanders share in the country\u2019s economic prosperity, which \u201cmust\u201d go hand-in hand with environmental responsibility.

Other policies agreed include increasing the minimum wage to NZ$20 an hour by 2020, re-entering the Pike River mine, increasing funding for the department of conservation and establishing a climate commission. New Zealand First will have four cabinet positions in the new government and one under-secretary role, with portfolios to include defence, infrastructure, regional development, children, seniors and internal affairs. As deputy prime minister and foreign affairs minister, Peters will be taking on roles he has held in previous governments. From 1996 to 1998 he served as deputy prime minister under a National-led government, and in 2005-2008 he was foreign affairs minister in Helen Clark\u2019s Labour-led government. Ardern is scheduled to be officially sworn in on Thursday, making her New Zealand\u2019s third female prime minister and, at 37, the country\u2019s youngest leader in 150 years.

Last week Peters, whose New Zealand First party won nine seats in September\u2019s general election, said he would form a coalition government with Labour, after weeks of negotiations that saw incumbent Bill English\u2019s National party, which has the largest number of MPs, leave empty-handed. English confirmed on Tuesday he would remain in charge of the National party, despite losing a general election for the second time as leader. On Monday, US president Donald Trump called Ardern at her home in Auckland to offer his congratulations. A White House press release said the phone call had reaffirmed the two countries\u2019 close ties. \u201cThe two leaders underscored the importance of the bilateral partnership between the United States and New Zealand and pledged to continue close cooperation on the many priorities the two countries share,\u201d the statement read.

Legal observers said they expect several advocacy groups to challenge the new law in courts, pitting it against the country\u2019s Charter of Rights and Freedoms as well as the provincial equivalent. </p> <p>One day earlier Trudeau \u2013 whose Liberal party holds 40 seats in the province of Quebec \u2013 gave a more careful responsible, apparently not wanting to be seen as interfering in Quebec politics. </p> <p>\u201cThe federal government has an obligation to accept the fact that the provinces have a right to pass their own legislation, but as you know full well, as a Liberal, at the federal level, I believe fundamentally in rights, in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and I will always defend that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not up to the federal government to challenge this, but we will certainly be looking at how this will unfold with full respect for the national assembly.\u201d </p> <p>Quebec officials have said the law \u2013 which does not specifically mention the niqab or burqa \u2013 was designed to address public safety, noting that it would also apply to masked protesters.</p> <p>\u201cWe are just saying that for reasons linked to communication, identification and safety, public services should be given and received with an open face,\u201d Philippe Couillard, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/18/quebec-passes-law-banning-muslims-from-wearing-face-coverings-in-public\">the premier of Quebec told reporters on Wednesday. </a>\u201cWe are in a free and democratic society.

          "bodyText": "Justin Trudeau has said it is not the government\u2019s business to tell a woman what or what not to wear after the Canadian province of Quebec passed a law \u2013 believed to be the first of its kind in North America \u2013 obliging women wearing the niqab or burqa to unveil when riding public transit or receiving government services. On Wednesday, Quebec\u2019s Liberal government flexed its majority to vote in a law banning face coverings for those offering or receiving services from government departments, as well as municipalities, school boards, public health services and transit authorities. The legislation has been condemned by critics who say it deliberately targets Muslim women. Others have raised the possibility that women who wear the niqab or burqa would not be able to access health services, sit for school exams or borrow books from the library. Amid widespread confusion as to how the new law would be applied and who it would affect, provincial authorities said they would work with municipalities, schools and public daycares to establish clear guidelines. On Friday, Trudeau said his government was looking into the legislation. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s the government\u2019s business to tell a woman what she should or shouldn\u2019t be wearing,\u201d the prime minister told reporters. \u201cAs a federal government, we are going to take our responsibility seriously and look carefully at what the implications are.\u201d When asked if his government would move to challenge the law in court, Trudeau simply repeated that Ottawa was looking carefully at the implications of the law. Legal observers said they expect several advocacy groups to challenge the new law in courts, pitting it against the country\u2019s Charter of Rights and Freedoms as well as the provincial equivalent. One day earlier Trudeau \u2013 whose Liberal party holds 40 seats in the province of Quebec \u2013 gave a more careful responsible, apparently not wanting to be seen as interfering in Quebec politics. \u201cThe federal government has an obligation to accept the fact that the provinces have a right to pass their own legislation, but as you know full well, as a Liberal, at the federal level, I believe fundamentally in rights, in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and I will always defend that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not up to the federal government to challenge this, but we will certainly be looking at how this will unfold with full respect for the national assembly.\u201d Quebec officials have said the law \u2013 which does not specifically mention the niqab or burqa \u2013 was designed to address public safety, noting that it would also apply to masked protesters. \u201cWe are just saying that for reasons linked to communication, identification and safety, public services should be given and received with an open face,\u201d Philippe Couillard, the premier of Quebec told reporters on Wednesday. \u201cWe are in a free and democratic society. You speak to me, I should see your face, and you should see mine. It\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d On Friday, a small group of people protested at bus stops in Montreal, with their faces covered by ski masks and scarves. \u201cThis law is targeting specific people and cultures, which is not fair,\u201d one protestor told the Montreal Gazette. \u201cWe think it is inhibiting people from practicing the freedoms they have as Canadians.\u201d",

But he was wrong. Young voters and women championed Ardern\u2019s vision, and she quickly became known for her wit and backbone when facing opponents.</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> From Auckland convention centres to grimy pubs on the west coast, Ardern\u2019s personal popularity drew huge crowds around the country \u2013 an outpouring that was dubbed \u201cJacindamania\u201d, and led to comparisons between Ardern and \u201crock star\u201d politicians such as Barack Obama and Justin Trudeau.</p> \n<p>\u201cDo it for all of us,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/07/jacindamania-spreads-as-jeremy-corbyn-urges-new-zealands-ardern-to-do-it-for-us\">the UK Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, recently urged her</a>, reflecting the hopes of Labour supporters around the world. </p> \n<p> \u201cI am certainly going to try to keep positive momentum for the progressive movements from around the world,\u201d said Ardern, when asked if she had been passed the torch from Corbyn and from Bernie Sanders in the US. \u201cBut I can only be myself. I am never going to replicate any other leader. They\u2019ve done amazing things in and of their own right, but I\u2019m Jacinda Ardern.\u201d</p> \n<p>When Labour eventually takes office it cannot expect an easy ride. With controversial plans to slash immigration, address the boom in dairy and explore a manned re-entry of the Pike river mine, Ardern\u2019s government will face fierce opposition from the National party, which holds 56 seats in the 120-strong parliament, and from many sectors of New Zealand society that want the country to stay the same. </p> \n<p>But for now, Labour\u2019s battle is over. Change has come to New Zealand, whether it is ready or not. </p>",

She has promised to lift more than 200,000 children out of poverty, raise the minimum wage, crack down on foreign speculators buying up prime land, and increase the refugee quota. \u201cWhat Brexit and the Trump outcome really said to me is, we do have a sense of financial insecurity that really exists in a number of countries, and politicians have the choice to either respond to that financial insecurity with messages of hope, and a plan around how we are going to, in the face of ongoing globalisation and automation, make sure that there is a future for our workforce and our young people; or we can respond to the fear that exists,\u201d Ardern told the Guardian. \u201cI think that fear has legitimately come through in those elections, and that really was a message to me about what we need to be talking about to allay those fears.\u201d A devoted Labour member since the age of 17, Ardern eventually said yes to the leadership. Within weeks, support for Labour had surged dramatically, increasing polling results by 19 points in just over a month. Her popularity was dismissed as \u201cstardust\u201d by her opponent, the National party\u2019s Bill English, who anticipated that her honeymoon period would be short-lived. But he was wrong. Young voters and women championed Ardern\u2019s vision, and she quickly became known for her wit and backbone when facing opponents. From Auckland convention centres to grimy pubs on the west coast, Ardern\u2019s personal popularity drew huge crowds around the country \u2013 an outpouring that was dubbed \u201cJacindamania\u201d, and led to comparisons between Ardern and \u201crock star\u201d politicians such as Barack Obama and Justin Trudeau. \u201cDo it for all of us,\u201d the UK Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, recently urged her, reflecting the hopes of Labour supporters around the world. \u201cI am certainly going to try to keep positive momentum for the progressive movements from around the world,\u201d said Ardern, when asked if she had been passed the torch from Corbyn and from Bernie Sanders in the US. \u201cBut I can only be myself. I am never going to replicate any other leader. They\u2019ve done amazing things in and of their own right, but I\u2019m Jacinda Ardern.\u201d When Labour eventually takes office it cannot expect an easy ride. With controversial plans to slash immigration, address the boom in dairy and explore a manned re-entry of the Pike river mine, Ardern\u2019s government will face fierce opposition from the National party, which holds 56 seats in the 120-strong parliament, and from many sectors of New Zealand society that want the country to stay the same. But for now, Labour\u2019s battle is over. Change has come to New Zealand, whether it is ready or not.",

The Labour/NZ First coalition government will be a minority one, with a combined 55 seats, and will rely on a confidence and supply deal with the Green party\u2019s eight MPs. The Greens leader, James Shaw, said his delegates would vote on Thursday night on the agreement, which would give the party three ministerial roles and an under-secretarial position. It will be first time the Greens have been in government. Shaw said he was \u201cvery confident\u201d the deal would go ahead and dismissed the \u201cmythology\u201d that NZ First and the Greens hate each other, saying that while Peters is not easy to work with, he is \u201cconstructive\u201d. Ardern, he added, \u201cis the boss \u2013 I\u2019ll follow her lead.\u201d Peters said he had full confidence in Ardern and she had displayed \u201cextraordinary talent\u201d in the campaign and leading the Labour party. \u201cThe biggest issue is we have heard and read many comments about poverty and the concertinaing of wealth in fewer and fewer hands,\u201d said Peters. \u201cWe should address that issue. We did it in past decades in our great history and we want to be a part of doing it again.\u201d Peters said regional development, addressing the infrastructure deficit and improving the lives of New Zealand\u2019s most vulnerable people, would be priorities for the new government. After the 23 September election, the sitting National party was left with 56 seats and Labour 46 \u2013 both short of the 61 needed to form a government in the 120-seat parliament. NZ First, which secured nine seats, held the balance of power. Labour\u2019s victory is an extraordinary comeback after changing leaders just two months before the general election. The party\u2019s former leader Andrew Little handed the leadership to untested Ardern on 1 August after tanking in the polls. Within weeks, Ardern was responsible for a surge of support for her party, increasing polling results by 19 points in just over a month. Ardern\u2019s stunning popularity was dismissed as \u201cstardust\u201d by English, but she went on to experience huge support from young voters and women and was credited with breathing life back into the New Zealand political scene. Her personal popularity and the huge crowds she drew around the country was hailed \u201cJacindamania\u201d, and she was compared to rock-star politicians such as Barack Obama and Justin Trudeau. A Labour government has pledged to wipe out child poverty, make tertiary education free, reduce immigration by 20,000-30,000, decriminalise abortion, introduce a water tax and make all rivers swimmable within 10 years.",

On Friday, Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio offered his support, saying it was \u201cabout time\u201d US trade negotiators \u201ctook the pen away from corporate lobbyists and started writing trade policy that puts American workers first. Any trade proposal that makes multinational corporations nervous is a good sign that it\u2019s moving in the right direction for workers.\u201d But there is still some uncertainty whether Trump is deploying tough negotiating bluster or is seriously considering scuppering the agreement. After Donohue made his comments supporting the Nafta, Emily Davis, spokeswoman for the Office of the US Trade Representative, reiterated the administration\u2019s position. \u201cThe president has been clear that Nafta has been a disaster for many Americans,\u201d she said, and acknowledged that changes to the deal would \u201cof course be opposed by entrenched Washington lobbyists and trade associations. We have always understood that draining the swamp would be controversial in Washington.\u201d",

          "bodyText": "There are plenty of attractive college towns in the US. But Chapel Hill, in the centre of North Carolina, equidistant from its mountains and its coast, blends liberal philosophy and Southern culture in a way that borders on the utopian. From its community-minded businesses and political activism to a music scene that has quietly influenced the global stage, it\u2019s the kind of town that doesn\u2019t need to brag about itself or inspire a Portlandia to know its worth. And that\u2019s exactly why we\u2019ve chosen it to launch our series on the coolest towns and small cities in America to visit right now, which we\u2019ll be unveiling monthly over the next six months. \u201cAs close to magic as I\u2019ve ever been,\u201d was how author Thomas Wolfe described his days at the University of North Carolina (UNC). The red-brick campus \u2013 opened in 1795 as an affordable alternative to the Ivy League universities \u2013 remains a bewitching presence in the town of Chapel Hill and still provides much of the local colour: store fronts, road signs and much of the locals\u2019 wardrobe are dominated by the college colours. Even the fire trucks are Carolina Blue. Town and gown have a special relationship here. It\u2019s not just that you can see students keeping up a daily protest at the town\u2019s confederate statue, Silent Sam, or sit next to them as they type up late-night essays over triple espressos at the Open Eye Cafe. It\u2019s that you can buy a delicious $3 burrito from a place called Cosmic Cantina, watch high-quality performing arts and even take in a free lecture from one of UNC\u2019s many famous alumni. Chef Bill Smith, who runs Crooks Corner, the town\u2019s best-known restaurant, was a UNC student in 1967, when most southerners considered it a communist haven. \u201cAnybody weird in your family you sent here so they wouldn\u2019t embarrass you,\u201d says Smith. \u201cWe had all the misfits, and that individual streak still lives strong.\u201d Since then, an influx of research and tech companies \u2013 not to mention a successful college basketball team \u2013 has brought prosperity and respectability. The town\u2019s growth has also caused it to merge, seamlessly, with neighbouring Carrboro, whose 6.4 square miles takes the towns\u2019 combined population to 80,000. \u201cThere\u2019s a natural synergy between the two,\u201d says Lydia Lavelle, who admits that most visitors wouldn\u2019t even notice they\u2019ve crossed a town limit as they walk down the main drag of Franklin Street. Carrboro\u2019s second openly gay mayor, Lavelle is proud to work in \u201cthe most progressive city in the south\u201d but equally proud of its music scene. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what you\u2019re into, there\u2019s something for everyone here.\u201d CULTURE Carolina Basketball museum You can\u2019t hope to understand this town until you experience its fanaticism for college sports and in particular its championship-winning basketball team. The Tar Heels took their sixth national college title this year; they\u2019re also the team that incubated Michael Jordan\u2019s world-changing talent. Try to get tickets to a game at the Dean E Smith Center if you\u2019re visiting in-season (November to March) but you can visit the basketball museum, next door to the arena, any time. It reopened in September after a major renovation and gives a good sense of why the college is dominant in all manner of sports, as well as why it hates its rivals Duke so much. \u2022 450 Skipper Bowles Drive, goheels.com Flyleaf Books You know those staff recommendations you get in bookshops?

The PlayMakers theatre, a professional company in residence at the university, has built an excellent reputation for its productions and its support for new writing, while the improv scene is about to get a new lease of life with the opening of The Pit, a comedy club by Ali Reza Farahnakian, founding member of the Upright Citizens Brigade and the People\u2019s Improv Theater. The Current Artspace + Studio, will host avant-garde work when it opens its doors in February 2018. \u2022 Memorial Hall, 114 East Cameron Avenue, carolinaperformingarts.org BARS The Crunkleton Wood-panelled and darkly lit, the Crunkleton exudes a quiet reassurance the moment you walk in. One look at the bow-tied bartender moving effortlessly about his work, and the shelves of bourbons, ryes and gins behind him, and you know you\u2019re getting a good cocktail. It\u2019s also a democratic space where regulars still come in to order Bud Light. Its owner, Gary Crunkleton, is a much-loved local known as much for his forthright opinions as his excellent chemistry at the bar; it\u2019s worth braving the weekend crush to get a sniff of the lemon curd, ginger-lemongrass and bourbon concoction, the bitter southerner ($12). \u2022 320 West Franklin Street, thecrunkleton.com Top of the Hill Restaurant, Brewery and Distillery Scott Maitland had served in the army and was studying at law school when he read the report that a TGI Friday was planning to take a lease in the middle of main street. He hated that idea, so he raised money to buy the lease himself, dropped out of school, and established one of North Carolina\u2019s earliest microbreweries, Top of the Hill. Locals credit him as a pioneer of the town\u2019s now-flourishing local and organic movement; the rooftop bar, from which you can look out over the whole of Franklin Street, is Chapel Hill\u2019s most visibly lively joint. Its distillery, a little further up Franklin, makes rum, gin and whiskey, and is open for tours and tastings. \u2022 10z glass of beer from $4.50. 100 East Franklin Street, thetopofthehill.com Orange County Social Club If you want to feel like you live here, hang out at the Orange County Social Club. \u201cIt\u2019s like our second living room,\u201d says Jamie Fioccio, the proprietor of Flyleaf Books. \u201cIt\u2019s low-key and relaxed, and everyone always looks deep in conversation. And you can tell who\u2019s running the bar that night by the style of music that\u2019s playing.\u201d The decor has a homespun feel \u2013 patchwork bunting and paper lightshades and an eclectic collection of tchotchkes reside in the niches above the bar. Combine that with comfy sofas, a pool table and a bar full of people who can tell you what bands are playing where tonight, and you\u2019ll feel at home in no time. \u2022 108 East Main Street, Carrboro, on Facebook The Baxter When a day strolling round UNC\u2019s beautiful quads and lawns has you all nostalgic and yearning to be a student again, this is the place to be. The bar isn\u2019t the focus here as much as the 50 arcade and pinball machines that line the walls, allowing you to revisit Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter Donkey Kong and Pac-Man. It\u2019s a place for close encounters of the geekiest kind, as evidenced by the Millennium Falcon hanging from the ceiling and the action hero models lined up behind the bar. It\u2019s an over-21 establishment at night but kids are welcome on weekends until 5pm. \u2022 108 North Graham Street, baxterarcade.com FOOD Curryblossom Caf\u00e9 Zen Yinger, a Chapel Hill resident who grew up in Mumbai, has eaten a lot of dosas. \u201cThe ones at Vimala\u2019s Curryblossom Caf\u00e9 (dosas from $10) are just the way you\u2019re used to in India,\u201d says Yinger. \u201cOther people\u2019s are either too spicy or not spicy enough.\u201d The crispy sourdough pancakes (from $8), filled with either potato masala or tandoori chicken, require a tray rather than a plate to accommodate their size but then generosity is a feature of the place. Vimala Rajendran describes her food as \u201cwhat you\u2019d get if you came to my house without calling first\u201d and her \u201ceverybody eats\u201d food justice policy means even those who can\u2019t afford to pay for a meal here are welcome. \u2022 431 West Franklin Street, curryblossom.com Mediterranean Deli When Jamil Kadoura opened a deli on Franklin Street 27 years ago it could seat just 12 people. These days his spacious premises bustles every lunchtime with dozens of diners and he\u2019s just opened a large store next door. Many of the kitchen and waiting staff are family members: \u201cEveryone in our family works here while they work out what they really want to do,\u201d he says, smiling. His array of salads, meat and fish create a celebration of all things Middle Eastern, from Turkish lentil salad and hearts of palm to lahm-bi-ajeen, a Lebanese meat pizza. \u2022 Dishes from \u00a36.50. 410 West Franklin Street, mediterraneandeli.com Pizzeria Mercato A new addition to the Carrboro food scene, this restaurant is unapologetically industrial: the \u201cart\u201d on the walls is just sheet metal stapled together. And while the pizza\u2019s good (from $13), it\u2019s the rest of the menu \u2013 octopus lentil salad ($13), grilled white corn ($8.50), crispy springer mountain chicken wings ($7.50) \u2013 that\u2019s the real benchmark of its kitchen. The family behind it are Gabe Barker and his parents, Ben and Karen, who are award-winning chefs. Karen\u2019s desserts (ice-cream and sorbets from $3.50) are worth the visit alone. \u2022 408 West Weaver Street, Carrboro, pizzeriamercatonc.com The Root Cellar \u201cThis is my favourite place to have breakfast,\u201d says Jay Patel, general manager of the Franklin Hotel. That includes a mouthwatering, locally sourced breakfast menu \u2013 from honey and homemade peanut butter bagels ($5.95) to shrimp\u2019n\u2019grits \u2013 but also an atmosphere that welcomes people to stay, meet and work in the common space. \u201cEvery time you come here you\u2019ll see people just hanging out, working on laptops, and every time you come you can guarantee you\u2019ll run into someone you know,\u201d says Patel. \u2022 750 Martin Luther King Jr Boulevard, Chapel Hill, rootcellarchapelhill.com MUSIC Local 506 There\u2019s so much live music in Chapel Hill it literally spills out onto the streets. And that\u2019s not just during the festivals, of which there are plenty. During the summer months the Carolina Inn, the town\u2019s fancy hotel, presents live bands on its lawn every Friday night, and in Carrboro there are free outdoor gigs at the Weaver Street Market. Thanks to the large student populations in the Durham-Raleigh-Chapel Hill triangle, the music scene offers much more than just its famed indie roots. Every local band making a name for itself has played the Local 506, a 250-capacity venue where a single week\u2019s programming might encompass metal, indie, folk and singer-songwriters. \u2022 506 West Franklin Street, Local506.com Cat\u2019s Cradle Chapel Hill has a 40-year history nurturing its own unique school of rock \u2013 and that\u2019s thanks to the Cat\u2019s Cradle. It has moved locations several times but never lost momentum, and over the years has hosting acts such as Nirvana, Public Enemy, REM and Ben Folds Five (who were themselves UNC alumni). Now residing in Carrboro, it\u2019s largely a haven for rock and punk, while the smaller back room remains a great place for catching up-and-coming bands. \u2022 300 East Main Street, Carrboro, catscradle.com The Cave As music editor of IndyWeek, the local newspaper, Allison Hussey has her pick of venues. \u201cBut I really love the Cave,\u201d she says, \u201cIt\u2019s tiny: only about a 75-person capacity, but hosts great shows that are wild and fun, and everyone who works there is a musician, so there\u2019s a huge pool of talent.\u201d A number of great bands have played the venue when just starting out, including Arcade Fire, so you might just hear the next big thing. \u2022 451\u00bd West Franklin Street, caverntavern.com Who to follow on Instagram @jessstringer A flavour of local life from the editor of Chapel Hill magazine @trianglefoodadventures The best and newest dishes and restaurants in the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill region \u2022 The trip was provided by Visit North Carolina with accommodation at The Franklin Hotel, 311 West Franklin Street, (doubles from $209).

          "bodyText": "Days after Justin Trudeau told the United Nations that his government was working hard to improve the quality of life for indigenous peoples in Canada, it has emerged that his government spent more than C$110,000 ($88,000) in legal fees to avoid spending C$6,000 on orthodontics for a First Nations teenager suffering from chronic pain. The figures, released through the Access to Information Act, were made public by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation on Friday. They relate to a continuing court battle that has pitted the federal government against Josey Willier, a teenager from Sucker Creek First Nation, who for two years complained of chronic headaches and jaw pain stemming from an impacted tooth and a severe overbite. In 2014, two orthodontists warned that without braces, Willier would eventually need invasive jaw surgery. One noted that Willier\u2019s condition would probably worsen and could leave her with difficulties in eating and speaking. For help in paying the C$6,000 treatment, the family turned to a benefit program run by the federal government \u2013 which covers the cost of health services, basic dental care and orthodontic treatment when medically necessary for First Nations people living on reserves. The family\u2019s request was denied by the Health Canada, who said her condition was not serious enough to warrant braces. Three appeals of the department\u2019s decision proved unsuccessful. With the help of a lawyer working pro bono, the family took their case to the country\u2019s federal court, where a judge determined that the denial of payment was \u201creasonable\u201d.

According to the GMB union it supports nearly 10,000 further jobs through its suppliers. </p> \n  <h2>What is the Government doing about it? </h2> \n  <p>Political powersharing at Stormont has been in cold storage for months.

          "bodyText": "The day has been dominated by the ructions following the US decision to slap 219% tariffs on Bombardier, the result of a dispute with rival Boeing. Here\u2019s our latest report: The government has warned aircraft manufacturer Boeing it could lose UK defence contracts over its part in a US decision to slap punitive tariffs of 219% on rival Bombardier, in a dispute that threatens to sour trade relations between London and Washington. Theresa May said she was \u201cbitterly disappointed\u201d by the move to impose a tariff on sales of Bombardier\u2019s C-Series passenger jet, which threatens at least 1,000 manufacturing jobs in Northern Ireland. Michael Fallon, the UK defence secretary, stepped up the government\u2019s rhetoric, warning that Boeing\u2019s assault on Bombardier \u201ccould jeopardise\u201d its chances of securing government contracts. The business secretary, Greg Clark, joined the chorus of disapproval, branding the ruling \u201cunjustified\u201d and vowing to work with Canada - where Bombardier is based - to get it overturned. The backlash follows an interim decision by the US Department of Commerce, which agreed with Boeing\u2019s case that Bombardier received unfair, anti-competitive state support from the Quebec regional government, including a \u00a3740m bailout. Bombardier, which has also received \u00a3113m in repayable funding from the UK government, called the decision \u201cabsurd and divorced from the reality about the financing of multibillion-dollar aircraft programmes\u201d. The full story is here: On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Here\u2019s our full report on Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s departure from his role as German finance minister: Here\u2019s Foster\u2019s tweet on her talks with Theresa May over Bombardier jobs: Arlene Foster, the leader of Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionists, has said UK prime minister Theresa May has given a commitment to work to secure jobs in Belfast following the Bombardier row. The DUP of course have an important position in UK politics, given they are now propping up May\u2019s government in Westminster. Donald Trump\u2019s proposed US tax reforms have given some support to markets, but investors remain to be fully convinced the US president will be able to pass these latest plans given his legislative difficulties so far in his term. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: While the headlines are sure to focus on the tax cuts for rich individuals, the market focus will no doubt centre on the planned corporate tax cut which has the potential to sharply impact profitability throughout the market. With a hawkish Yellen and the prospect of a US economic boom, it comes as no surprise that the dollar has been a big outperformer of late. While the prospect of lower taxes promise a bounty for stocks, it is worth noting that Trump has yet to deliver on any major policies given the constant rebuttals from the Republican dominated Congress. There is a good chance that these tax reforms are going to be as difficult to pass at the health reforms, with issues such as the controversial border adjustment tax likely to provide significant hurdles along the way. There is also some notable caution thanks to the continuing concerns about the tensions between the US and North Korea. Even so, European markets managed to end the day in positive territory. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 27.77 points or 0.38% higher at 7313.51 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.41% to 12,657.41 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.25% at 5281.96 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB gained 0.85% to 22,622.19 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.76% ahead at 10,368.9 But in Greece, the Athens market dipped 0.5% to 736.64 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently flat on the day. Over to German politics again, and if the Greek government is celebrating the prospect of Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble leaving as finance minister, the joy may be short-lived. ING says: UK defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon has ruled out cancelling existing orders with Boeing over the Bombardier dispute. But he pointedly added that there were other contracts which Boeing was expected to bid for in the future. Earlier Fallon told reporters in Belfast that the UK\u2019s current relationship with Boeing could be damaged by the row and even suggested the UK might decline to buy Boeing products in future. Now he has told Reuters the UK would not cancel orders from Boeing for nine P-8 spy planes and 50 Apache helicopters but added: \u201cWe know they will be back at the door.\u201d Here\u2019s the statement from Boeing, courtesy of the Press Association: We have heard and understand the concerns from the Prime Minister and the Government about Bombardier workers in Northern Ireland. Boeing is committed to the UK and values the partnership, which stretches back almost 80 years. The company has doubled its direct employment in the UK since 2011 and tripled its spending with more than 250 companies in the UK supply chain over the same period, to 2.1 billion in 2016. More than 18,700 jobs in the UK are at Boeing or in the company\u2019s tier one supply chain. Earlier this month Boeing broke ground for its first factory in Europe, in Sheffield. We are pleased to work with our partners, including the British Government, and provide such a vote of confidence in the UK. Any claimed economic threat to Bombardier is due to the weakness of its product in the marketplace, which explains its desperate action that prompted the ITC case due to Bombardier\u2019s decision to violate US trade rules. Boeing welcomes competition and Bombardier can sell its aircraft anywhere in the world. But sales must be made according to globally-accepted trade rules. We believe that global trade only works if everyone abides by the same rules of the road, and that\u2019s a principle that ultimately creates the greatest value for Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States, and our respective aerospace industries. Boeing\u2019s petition to the International Trade Commission seeks to restore a level playing field in the US single-aisle airplane market. Boeing had to take action as subsidised competition has hurt us now and will continue to hurt us for years to come. With US refineries restarting after the closures caused by Hurricane Harvey, crude stocks fell by 1.8m barrels last week, compared to expectations of a 3.4m increase. But gasoline stocks rose by 1.1m barrels, rather than the 750,000 fall expected. More on the dollar. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: A better than expected durable goods order reading, and the prospect of Trump\u2019s tax speech this evening, allowed the dollar to maintain its post-Yellen growth this Wednesday. Ahead of Trump\u2019s appearance in Indiana details have been leaked about his proposed tax plan, the headlines being a lowering of the corporate rate from 35% to 20%, and a reduction to the top income tax rate from 39.6% to 35%. The Republicans want to push through these tax reforms in part to distract from their complete and utter failure at repealing Obamacare. They face myriad obstacles, however, not least a Democratic Party who\u2019ll be keen to hammer home the point that the proposed changes favour the country\u2019s wealthiest members, something that might not go down well with the President\u2019s key base of support. Regardless, the prospect of progress on one of Trump\u2019s market-wooing election promises has helped the dollar keep hold of most of its daily growth. The greenback was further shored up by a decent durable goods order figure, which came in at 1.7% against the 1.0% forecast and the miserable -6.8% the month previous. This all meant cable was pinned back at $1.34 after a 0.3% fall, with the euro suffering a 0.6% drop, taking the weary currency to a fresh, sub $1.175 one month nadir. Against the yen, which has been shaken in recent weeks by the North Korea situation, the dollar found even greater success, briefly hitting a 10 week peak of \u00a5113. Ryanair is back in the headlines with its latest cancellations, and affected passengers are already having to rethink their plans. Henry McDonald writes: There is more airplane-related trouble for Northern Ireland on top of the Boeing versus Bomdardier battle and it comes in the shape of Rynair. The budget airline has announced on Wednesday afternoon that it is suspending its Belfast to Gatwick route from November to March. The Belfast-Gatwick route is Ryanair\u2019s most popular airlink to Britain in Northern Ireland. Among those affected by the four month cancellation of flights is former Blue Peter presenter Zoe Salmon who tweeted today that her flight had been cancelled. A West Belfast choral society from the parish of St Agnes\u2019s will have to change their 60th anniversary bash in London in November. And here is a list of the affected routes: Back with Bombardier, and Ulster Unionist peer Lord Empey, vice chairman of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Aerospace, has slammed Boeing for \u201cbully boy tactics\u201d and said the disputed subsidy was in fact a loan: The launch aid that was provided to Bombardier which came via Treasury is repayable on the basis of royalties from sales so it is effectively a loan. Throughout my time as DETI and DEL Minister I am content that all transactions with Bombardier were consistent with EU State Aid rules. In the United States both cities and states give very substantial tax incentives and breaks to Boeing and other manufacturers. The majority of the C Series aircraft, by value, is actually produced in the US like the engine and avionics to name but two. What I see the core of this dispute being, given that Boeing did not even tender for the Delta Airlines contract, is an attempt by Boeing \u2013 and in Europe, Airbus \u2013 to suffocate Bombardier. It is bully boy tactics. The manufacturing of the C Series sees a dramatic increase in efficiency and a reduction in fuel consumption that would mean when oil prices rise the plane becomes much more significant. It is not the current version of the plane that is the target \u2013 it is the long term project and what flows from it that has got Boeing in particular so aggravated. In the markets, shares are edging higher but investors remain cautious thanks to the continuing tensions between North Korea and the US and ahead of Donald Trump\u2019s latest tax proposals. The dollar is moving higher following the hints from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen that US interest rates could rise again as early as December. In turn that has helped lift European markets as a weaker pound and euro gives a boost to exporters. The FTSE 100 is currently up 0.44%, Germany\u2019s Dax is 0.57% higher and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.34%. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is 0.13% better. Earlier US durable goods orders climbed by 1.7% in August, better than the 1% analysts had been expecting. Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, said: A sense of anticipation can be felt across the financial markets ahead of President Trump\u2019s tax proposal in Indiana later today. Although some information has been leaked that corporate tax may be lowered to 20% from 35%, market players are still likely to closely scrutinise the speech for further details on tax reforms. If legislation is passed this year, this should boost sentiment towards the US economy and support the Dollar further. Back with the reports that Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble is stepping down as German finance minister: Over in Canada, the 219% tariff imposed by the US on Bombardier has been described as an attack on the country. Quebec premier Philippe Couillard told reporters: \u201cQuebec has been attacked. And Quebec will resist. And Quebec will unite. All together we will protect our workers. All together we will be proud of our engineering.\u201d He said Quebec had taken a $1bn stake in Bombardier\u2019s C Series plane but had not received any government subsidies. Back with the row over Bombardier, and Boeing said it understands the UK\u2019s concerns but blames its rival\u2019s \u201cweak products.\u201d A spokesman told Reuters that the company was committed to the UK and it had heard and understood the concerns of the UK government over Bombardier\u2019s workers in Northern Ireland. But it added that any claimed economic threat to Bombardier was due to the weakness of its product in the marketplace. Earlier Boeing said in a statement: Global trade works only if everyone plays by the rules that we\u2019ve all endorsed to ensure fair competition, as adjudicated by independent national and international bodies. This dispute has nothing to do with limiting innovation or competition, which we welcome. Rather, it has everything to do with maintaining a level playing field and ensuring that aerospace companies abide by trade agreements. The process that will continue to play out over the next several months at the International Trade Commission and Commerce is the longstanding, transparent course for examining and addressing situations where products are \u2018dumped\u2019 into the United States at below-cost prices for the purposes of gaining market share. We have full confidence that this will continue to be a fair and fact-based investigation, and we look forward to its conclusion early next year. In the wake of the weekend\u2019s general election in Germany, there are now reports that Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble will be stepping down as finance minister to become president of the country\u2019s parliament. Sch\u00e4uble was first elected 45 years ago and is the longest-serving MP in the Bundestag. He has been finance minister since 2009, and was heavily involved in the bailout deals with Greece, albeit he had a fractious relationship with the struggling country. At one point he is believed to have said the heavily endebted Greece should leave the eurozone. A decade after the financial crisis, the global economy is still vulnerable to another crash. So says the World Economic Forum today, in a new report into global competitiveness. WEF warns that some banks are actually less sound than they were before the credit crunch struck in 2007, triggering the near-collapse of the financial system. The Fund says: After a long period of low growth following the global financial crisis, the world economy appears to have picked up speed. This is welcome news. Yet despite this gradual improvement, policymakers in many countries are concerned about the prospects for longterm economic development. This is partly because the current expansion appears to be cyclical, bolstered by exceptionally low interest rates rather than by the fundamental drivers of structural growth. Productivity improvements appear to remain sluggish and are not expected to return to the levels experienced in past decades. The report also showed that Britain has dropped to 8th, from 7th, in WEF\u2019s list of competitiveness. WEF says Britain\u2019s \u2018macroeconomic environment\u2019 is a concern (that\u2019s a reference to the UK\u2019s growth, inflation and unemployment situation). It warns that this situation could deteriorate further after the UK has left the European Union. The United Kingdom (UK) (8th) falls one spot. This drop does not yet reflect the outcome of the Brexit negotiations, which is likely to further undermine the country\u2019s competitiveness. Currently the country performs very well on technological readiness and the sophistication of its business sector (4th and 7th overall). Its macroeconomic environment remains challenging (68th) and could become an important constraint in the future as the timeline for a reduction of the fiscal deficit is repeatedly pushed back. The full report is online here. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has just told his party conference in Brighton that the tariffs imposed on Bombardier C Series planes threaten \u201cthousands of jobs\u201d. Corbyn says that Theresa May must use Britain\u2019s special relationship with America to protect the company\u2019s workers in Northern Ireland. Thousands of jobs are now at stake, thousands of jobs at risk A Prime minister betting our eocnomic future on a deregulated trade deal with the US might want to take a moment to explain how 220% tarifsf are going to boost our exports from this country. Are you one of the 400,00 people whose Ryanair flight has just been cancelled? If so, Hannah Maundrell, Editor in Chief of money.co.uk, has some advice: \u201cIt\u2019s so disappointing for Ryanair passengers whose flights have been cancelled, even with more notice this time it\u2019s still seriously frustrating. Ryanair are still in a mess here, but you shouldn\u2019t be left out of pocket. \u201cIf your flight has been cancelled, ask for a refund. You should get your money back within 7 days or given an alternative flight. This should also apply to connecting flights you miss as a result, as long as they were booked together. \u201cAside from this, generally if your flight is delayed by over 3 hours you can claim compensation for the inconvenience. Cancellation amounts vary from \u20ac250 to \u20ac600 depending on your flight. \u201cIf your other travel plans are impacted, look to your travel insurance for cover. This is when having a decent policy can really come in handy.\u201d Wow! Breaking away from Bombardier.... budget airline Ryanair has just extended its flight cancellation programme, affecting an additional 400,000 passengers. Ryanair is cancelling 34 routes until next year, in a fresh attempt to tackle its rostering crisis that has left it without enough pilots. Those affected are being offered a refund or an alternative flight. It\u2019s a big u-turn; just last week, CEO Michael O\u2019Leary said he hoped to avoid further cancellations. The UK government is rolling out the big guns against Boeing, with the defence secretary dropping an unsubtle hint that Britain could retaliate. Sir Michael Fallon has told reporters in Belfast that the UK\u2019s current relationship with Boeing could be damaged by the row. He even suggests that London might decline to buy Boeing products in future: Fallon says: \u201cThis is not the behaviour we expect from Boeing and it could indeed jeopardise our future relationship with them. \u201cBoeing has significant defence contracts with us and still expects to win further contracts. Boeing wants and we want a long term partnership but that has to be two-way. Boeing is an important investor in the United Kingdom and an important employer in the United Kingdom but we would prefer this kind of issue to be settled on a negotiated basis. \u201cThis is not the kind of behaviour that we expect from along-term partner and I\u2019ve made that very clear to Boeing. (Thanks to Reuters for the quotes). Boeing\u2019s military arm produces a wide range of equipment, including Apache attack helicopters, Chinook transport helicopters and surveillance planes. As this infographic shows, Boeing also employs or supports more than 10,000 jobs in the UK; any tit-for-tat retaliation could affect them. Last night, Delta argued that Boeing\u2019s case lacked merit, because it simply doesn\u2019t make an aircraft that competes directly with Bombardier\u2019s C Series: St\u00e9phane Lessard, the consul general of Canada in Denver, warned that imposing steep tariffs on Bombardier could backfire. Here are some photos of Bombardier staff working on C Series aeroplane wings: Back in Belfast, a member of the Northern Ireland Assembly has revealed he has family members employed at the Bombardier plant in East Belfast, and that he fears for their future job prospects. Chris Lyttle of the cross community Alliance Party is an East Belfast representative in the deadlocked Stormont Assembly. Lyttle said: \u201cThis was an astounding ruling but it is important to remember it is only preliminary. The US International Trade Commission must now find as Boeing did not compete for the Delta contract awarded to Bombardier C Series and does not serve this market, no injury has occurred. \u201cI have constituents, friends and family employed by Bombardier and I am acutely aware of the concern that exists amongst staff. Alliance has already engaged on this issue with the most senior levels of the UK, US and Canadian Governments and we will continue to do so, to work to achieve a fair outcome and protect the thousands of jobs in our aerospace manufacturing sector and economy. \u201cThis ruling could have severe implication not only for jobs in NI but for international trade with the United States, particularly in the aerospace sector. The UK government is turning up the pressure on Boeing. Business secretary Greg Clark says that the US planemaker\u2019s complaint against Bombardier is simply \u201cunjustified\u201d, and vowed to work with Canada to reverse last night\u2019s preliminary ruling. We will work completely hand in glove with the Canadian government to get this overturned. Clark also believes that the final ruling in this dispute, due next year, should be in Bombardier\u2019s favour. The Trade Commission needs to look to see if there\u2019s been any detriment to Boeing.. There hasn\u2019t been, as this aircraft doesn\u2019t compete with Boeing. Labour MP Conor McGinn, who was born and brought up in Northern Ireland, says the Bombardier dispute shows that Britain is stronger within the European Union. \u201cHard Brexit campaigners in Government keep promising that Britain will get a great new trade deal with the US after we leave the EU. That\u2019s how they justify their ideological choice to leave the Single Market and Customs Union. \u201cBut now we see the US Government taking a decision which is totally against our economic interests and could put thousands of jobs at risk across the UK, especially in Northern Ireland. \u201cWe can\u2019t rely on a good trade deal with the US being agreed after Brexit. To protect jobs and our economy, we need to stay in the Single Market and Customs Union to preserve trade with our largest market \u2013 the EU.\u201d Paul Adams, head of aerospace at management consultancy, Vendigital, reckons that the Bombardier-Boeing dispute will take some time to resolve: \u201cBoeing\u2019s legal challenge may in part be influenced by Trump\u2019s \u2018America First\u2019 policy. The US manufacturer could be seeking to test the new administration\u2019s resolve when it comes to protecting US jobs against foreign competitors selling to US customers. \u201cAs history shows, trade disputes in the aerospace sector can become protracted - the Boeing / Airbus dispute ultimately had to be resolved by the World Trade Organisation. It is likely that Bombardier will appeal the US court\u2019s decision, before the final hearing in 2018. Manufacturing Northern Ireland, a trade body, have blasted the US tariff decision -- and warned that Britain could be more exposed to such rulings after it leaves the EU: In other news: UK retail sales have grown at their fastest pace in two years this. That\u2019s according to the latest CBI Distributive Trades Survey, which suggests consumers are still spending despite rising inflation and weak wages. It\u2019s a volatile survey, though, so.... The DUP\u2019s Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has repeated his warning that Boeing could be hit by retaliatory sanctions. Donaldson, who is the party\u2019s chief whip, tells Sky News: Boeing do sell a lot of aircraft to the UK, and to Canada, and to other countries. The US government has to weigh that in the balance as well. We think there is still a strong case to be made for Bombardier, and believe that common sense will prevail in the end. Q: So you would support tit-for-tat sanctions? Canada has made clear that they will impose import restrictions against Boeing, Donaldson replies. It\u2019s too early to say what the UK should do, he adds. He also disputes the suggestion that the row has anything to do with Brexit, pointing out that Britain is still in the EU today. I can\u2019t believe that the US president wants to take an entirely protectionist approach against its closely ally, Donaldson adds. Q: What are the implications for Northern Ireland if this preliminary decision is upheld? It would be a \u201cdevastating blow\u201d to Bombardier if they were priced out of the US market, and we would struggle to keep the jobs in Belfast, Donaldson warned. Labour\u2019s shadow industrial strategy minister, Chi Onwurah, has also heavily criticised Theresa May over the Bombardier tariff ruling. Onwurah told Sky News: It\u2019s a damning indictment of the criminal negligence and complacency of Theresa May and her government, and a sign of their entire lack of international negotiating skills which bodes really badly for our post-Brexit negotiations. Worryingly, the value of Bombardier\u2019s corporate bonds has fallen this morning. That means traders believe the risk that the Canadian firm defaults on its debts has risen. Bloomberg has the details: Bombardier Inc.\u2019s euro-denominated bonds maturing in 2021 have declined the most in more than two years after the U.S. imposed import duties of 220 percent on the company\u2019s C-series plane, threatening to upend deliveries of more than $5 billion to Delta Air Lines Inc. next year. The Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer\u2019s senior unsecured notes are currently down by more than seven price points at 99.963, according to Bloomberg prices at 10am London time. The notes had already fallen 2.2 points on Tuesday -- the same day that competitors Siemens AG and Alstrom SA agreed to join their rail businesses. That bond has been one of the top 10 most actively traded in the European secondary bond market, according to MarketAxess subsidiary, Trax. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn may comment on the Bombardier news when he addresses the Labour Party conference at noon today. Liberal Dem Leader Vince Cable has accused America of \u2018protectionist bullying\u2019 over the Bombardier ruling. He is urged Theresa May to stand alongside Canada\u2019s government in refusing to accept the new tariffs lying down. Cable says: \u201cRather than simply expressing \u2018bitter disappointment\u2019, our government should be out there fighting for vital British manufacturing jobs in Belfast. May must support Trudeau\u2019s administration in standing up to protectionist bullying from Donald Trump and his crude \u2018America First\u2019 philosophy. Do we really believe the US will save us from Brexit with a comprehensive trade deal, when this is how they deal with fair and free international competition?\u201d Workers at the Bombardier aerospace factory in Northern Ireland have admitted they are shocked and stunned by America\u2019s decision. The news that a tariff of 220% will be imposed on Bombardier\u2019s jet sales to Delta airlines has come a a big blow to the workforce, who make wings for the C Series planes. Geordie Burnside, a shop steward, says the size of the tariff - effectively tripling the cost of the C Series jet - has taken everyone by surprise. Burnside, who has worked at the factory for 26 years, told the Guardian that: \u201cI\u2019ve been getting phone calls from early morning asking why the ruling had slapped down such an enormous tariff. They cannot believe the enormity of it or get their heads around it. There have been a lot of tough times at this factory over the last 26 years and we got through. I hope that the company will appeal and the battle isn\u2019t over yet. Burnside also warned that the decision has big ramifications for Northern Ireland\u2019s economy: \u201cThere are highly skilled jobs inside this plant which is the biggest manufacturer in Northern Ireland. Thousands of other people\u2019s jobs outside of Bombardier depend on this company too. There are a lot of worried people out there not only in Northern Ireland but the Republic and Britain who supply into Bombardier. It\u2019s a very worrying time.\u201d The Press Association have written a handy Q&amp;A on the trade dispute between Bombardier and Boeing. What is the row about? It centres on US-based Boeing\u2019s allegations that Canadian-headquartered Bombardier received state subsidies allowing it to sell its C-Series planes at below-market prices in America. The DoC has carried out its own investigation and said it had made a preliminary determination that imports should be subject to a 219.63% import tariff, although it will continue to evaluate the figure. If the tariff is imposed when deliveries of the aircraft begin it will increase the cost of selling into one of the world\u2019s most important aviation markets. Bombardier is contracted to supply up to 125 C-Series aircraft to Atlanta-based Delta Airlines in a deal underpinning many staff posts at its manufacturing plant in Belfast. The UK Government has been actively lobbying in the US for a compromise between Boeing and Bombardier amid growing concern about the potential implications for Bombardier\u2019s Northern Ireland operations. What are the aerospace companies saying about it? Boeing submitted a petition with the US International Trade Commission and the Department of Commerce in April which claimed large government subsidies helped Bombardier launch an aggressive campaign to \u201cdump\u201d its C-Series aircraft in the US. It said there was a shared industry interest in a level playing field. Bombardier has repeatedly rejected Boeing\u2019s claims, accusing its rival of pure hypocrisy after it alleged anti-competition practices in the sale of aircraft. The manufacturer described the DoC\u2019s interim determination as \u201cabsurd\u201d and \u201cdivorced from the reality about the financing of multi-billion-dollar aircraft programmes\u201d. What are the implications for Belfast? Bombardier had been under financial pressure and invested large sums in its new jet programme, which is crucial to many jobs in the city. Last year the firm announced 1,080 job losses at its Northern Ireland plants following delays to the C-Series. It is one of the country\u2019s largest employers, with around 4,500 on the books. According to the GMB union it supports nearly 10,000 further jobs through its suppliers. What is the Government doing about it? Political powersharing at Stormont has been in cold storage for months. However the DUP\u2019s 10 anti-Brexit MPs are a crucial force propping up the Government in key votes after Theresa May lost her majority in this year\u2019s General Election. DUP leader Arlene Foster\u2019s influence has seen the Prime Minister lobbying US President Donald Trump during a recent visit to New York. Following the DoC\u2019s announcement the UK Government said it would \u201ccontinue to strongly defend UK interests\u201d and labelled Boeing\u2019s position as \u201cunjustified\u201d. More from Labour\u2019s shadows secretary of state for Northern Ireland: Northern Ireland\u2019s devolved government collapsed in January, and the region\u2019s political parties haven\u2019t yet agreed a new power-sharing setup. The CBI, which represents Britain\u2019s business leaders, has warned that this deadlock is hurting the economy. Angela McGowan, CBI Northern Ireland Director, says: \u201cBombardier makes a huge contribution to the Northern Irish economy. They are a major regional employer and support a wider supply chain that stretches across Northern Ireland. \u201cThe decision by the US Department of Commerce represents a challenge to the Northern Ireland economy and places an important driver of regional economic growth at risk. \u201cThis just reinforces the need for the swift return of an inclusive devolved government. Government and business must work in partnership to deliver a new far-reaching industrial strategy to improve regional resilience, economic competitiveness and facilitate growth. \u201cWith jobs and future prosperity in the region being put at risk by decisions made far away from Belfast, we need a devolved government that can speak up for and champion the needs of the local workers and businesses most affected.\u201d The BBC\u2019s Simon Jack has done a good blogpost explaining the issues around the Boeing-Bombardier case. In it, he points out that Boeing has received plenty of money from the US government over the years. Can it really complain about other companies getting subsidies with a straight face?! The deal with Delta to supply up to 125 planes was the largest order yet for its big hope, the C-Series, but an order only made possible, say Boeing, by absurdly low pricing made possible by Canadian and UK government subsidies. While it is true that Bombardier has received billions from the government of Quebec and the state\u2019s pension fund, Boeing has received more, a lot more, from the US military, Nasa and the State of Washington over many decades. Boeing would argue these were commercial arrangements, others would call them padded contracts amounting to subsidies. Jack adds that Theresa May is in a bind. She needs Northern Ireland\u2019s DUP to back her in parliament, but she can\u2019t really afford to upset a major employer like Boeing either.... Boeing issued a polite but firm reminder to Theresa May that it employs 16,500 people in its UK supply chain and last week broke ground on a new facility in Sheffield. The Prime Minister may find it difficult to keep her new best friends in the DUP sweet while not offending such an important employer in the rest of the UK. Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u2019d expect, there\u2019s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u2019s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Labour MP Owen Smith, shadow secretary of state for Northern Ireland, has heavily criticised Theresa May\u2019s government. He says they were \u2018criminally negligent\u2019 for not persuading the US to reject Boeing\u2019s claim. Smith also points out that the decision suggests cracking a new trade deal with America after Brexit will be tough: Conservative MP Anna Soubry, a vocal opponent of Brexit, has also tweeted about the ruling: Unions are blaming Theresa May for not persuading Donald Trump to reject Boeing\u2019s claim. Ross Murdoch, of the GMB union,says the PM was: \u201casleep at the wheel when she could and should have been fighting to protect these workers. It\u2019s high time she woke up\u201d. Arlene Foster, the leader of Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionists, also said the Department of Commerce\u2019s decision was \u201cvery disappointing\u201d. Foster says: \u201cThe CSeries is a hugely innovative aircraft that is vital to Bombardier\u2019s operations in Belfast. It is this innovation that sets the C-Series apart and it is not in direct competition with Boeing. The Department of Commerce released its ruling against Bombardier last night - you can see it online here: U.S. Department of Commerce Issues Affirmative Preliminary Countervailing Duty Determination on Imports of 100- to 150-Seat Large Civil Aircraft From Canada It argues that Bombardier has received subsidies from the Canadian government on the C-Series planes that it has sold to the Delta airline, worth 219%. So, it is ordering US Customs and Border Protection to collect cash deposits on every plane shipped into America - effectively tripling the cost. U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross says the Trump administration won\u2019t tolerate illegal subsidies: \u201cThe U.S. values its relationships with Canada, but even our closest allies must play by the rules. The subsidization of goods by foreign governments is something that the Trump Administration takes very seriously, and we will continue to evaluate and verify the accuracy of this preliminary determination.\u201d Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner called on the government to protect the thousands of Bombardier workers in Belfast. She stressed that the UK had followed the rules and added that the government \u201cneeds to be robust in their defence of that\u201d. She told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cThe Bombardier situation is quite a crucial one because these are UK jobs that we depend on, thousands, and actually the government were involved in that contract process and were robust and I think that we have to defend the fact that that contract was awarded and we followed the rules. \u201cAt times Jeremy [Corbyn] talks about sometimes the global rules don\u2019t benefit UK jobs, but actually we followed the rules, we got that contract fair and square and the government must ensure that we protect those jobs to ensure that we can keep our businesses running.\u201d Q: There are reports that Canada may retaliate by imposing a block on Boeing imports into Canada. Should Britain hit Boeing with reprisals too? Sir Jeffrey Donaldson MP says it is too early to consider this, as we\u2019ve only had the preliminary decision from the US Department of Commerce. But he drops a hint that the UK could hit back, saying Theresa May is \u201cputting down a marker\u201d by criticising the decision so strongly today. If Boeing want to do business in the UK, they need to stop acting in such an unreasonable and irrational way against an aircraft that is innovative and isn\u2019t in direct competition with Boeing. If America is about free trade and free enterprise, it really shouldn\u2019t be doing this. Reminder: Donaldson\u2019s position is significant, as the DUP are now propping up Theresa May\u2019s government in Westminster. Q: Are you pessimistic or optimistic about Bombardier\u2019s chances in this dispute, Sir Jeffrey? I believe David can defeat Goliath, Donaldson shoots back. Q: What did Trump say to Theresa May about this dispute? At that stage, they were waiting for the interim decision, replies Sir Jeffrey Donaldson. He\u2019s sure they\u2019ll speak again now the decision is out. Donaldson adds: He [Trump] has adopted in the past a protectionist approach to US business. But we believe strongly in this case that it isn\u2019t about protectionism because Bombardier and Boeing were not competing for the Delta aircraft [contract]. We think the C-Series is not in direct competition with Boeing. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, a Democratic Unionist Party MP, is also on the Today Programme. He says Bombardier\u2019s factory is critical to Belfast, supporting 4,000 jobs and around 80 firms in the supply chain. There would be devastating consequences for the economy if the factory were closed, and we\u2019re going to do everything we can to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen. Donaldson adds that Bombardier have a strong case, and accuses Boeing of acting unreasonably by bringing its case against its Canadian rival. The C-series is an innovative aircraft, it\u2019s hugely competitive, and that\u2019s why Boeing in the most unreasonable and irrational way have tried to block Bombardier from the market. Haley Dunne, director of public affairs at Bombardier Belfast, says the 219% tariff is \u201cabsurd\u201d. Speaking on Radio 4 she says that: It\u2019s a preliminary decision, and we\u2019ll continue though the process.... The magnitude of the fines that are being imposed are absolutely absurd. Q: Can you give any guarantees to your workers that jobs are safe? Dunne says that Boeing\u2019s claim is \u201cmeritless\u201d, and Bombardier are confident that the facts will support them in the end. However, there is \u201cno doubt\u201d that the C series jet is crucial to our future, she adds. This 219% tariff slapped on Bombardier could \u201ckill demand for the C-Series in the US\u201d, says the BBC\u2019s Simon Jack on the Today Programme. He points out that last night\u2019s ruling is only \u2018preliminary\u2019. A further ruling in February will examine how much damage has actually been suffered by Boeing (who didn\u2019t actually pitch for this contract to supply jets to Delta). Some critics have claimed that Boeing is just trying to \u201cstrangle a competitor\u201d by bringing its complaint, Jack adds. The UK government has hit back against the US Department of Commerce\u2019s decision to imposing a 219% tariff on sales of Bombardier\u2019s C-Series jet to Delta. Theresa May says she is \u201cbitterly disappointed\u201d by the move, and pledged to keep working with Bombardier to protect jobs in Northern Ireland. Unions had urged May to step in to protect Bombardier workers in Northern Ireland. She raised concerns about the future of the factory in a recent phone call with President Donald Trump, and also discussed the issue with Canadian PM Justin Trudeau when she visited Canada this month. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Thousands of aircraft workers in Northern Ireland have woken up to an uncertain future after the US sided with Boeing in its war against Canada\u2019s Bombardier. Donald Trump\u2019s administration have slapped Bombardier with preliminary tariffs of up to 219% on sales of its C-Series jet to the US airline Delta. This follows allegations from Boeing that Bombardier had unfairly used subsidies from the UK and Canada to sell its regional C-series jets at below cost into the US. The decision could be a huge blow to Northern Ireland\u2019s economy, as Bombardier is the region\u2019s biggest hi-tech employer, with more than 4,000 workers. Our Ireland correspondent, Henry McDonald, explains how the decision will hurt Bombardier, and how Canada has already hit back: If imposed, the duties would more than triple the cost of a C-Series aircraft sold in the US to about $61m per plane, based on Boeing\u2019s assertion that Delta received the planes for $19m each. Bombardier called the decision \u201cabsurd and divorced from the reality about the financing of multibillion-dollar aircraft programs\u201d. Canada\u2019s foreign affairs minister Chrystia Freeland reacted angrily to the decision saying it was \u201cclearly aimed at eliminating\u201d Bombardier\u2019s narrow body jets from the US market. We\u2019ll be tracking full reaction to the decision through the day. Also coming up today..... 11am BST: The CBI releases its survey of UK retail sales in September.

          "bodyText": "Chelsea Manning, the former US soldier who served seven years in military prison after instigating one of the biggest breaches of classified data in US history, has said she has been barred from entering Canada. On Monday, Manning posted on Twitter a report from the Canadian government that identified her as a foreign national \u201cwho has not been authorized to enter Canada\u201d due to prior convictions. \u201cSo, I guess Canada has permanently banned me?\u201d wrote Manning \u2013 one of the most prominent whistleblowers of modern times. The letter, addressed to the country\u2019s minister of immigration, said Manning had attempted to enter Canada at the official border crossing near Champlain, New York, late last week. Manning had told Canadian border officials that she had been convicted in 2013 of charges associated with the United States Espionage Act and had been released from prison in May. The letter added that if the same offence had been carried out in Canada, it \u201cwould equate to an indictable offence, namely treason\u201d, and could result in up to 14 years in prison. For this reason, Manning was deemed inadmissible to Canada. On Twitter, Manning rejected the comparison officials had attempted to make between the US and Canadian law, and said she planned to formally challenge the decision. In 2013, Manning was sentenced to 35 years in prison for sending more than 700,000 documents, videos and diplomatic cables to WikiLeaks. The classified and sensitive documents leaked by Manning \u2013 who had been assigned to an army unit in Iraq as an intelligence analyst \u2013 shone a light on the nature of warfare in Iraq and Afghanistan and included a video showing the US military launching an airstrike that killed a dozen people, including two Reuters news staffers. The 29-year-old was released earlier this year after her sentence was commuted by Barack Obama during the final days of his presidency. Manning\u2019s brush with the Canadian border authorities came as she was embarking on a bi-coastal tour to celebrate her newfound freedom. She had planned to drive up the east coast from New York to Montreal, then fly across Canada to Vancouver and drive down the west coast, stopping off to join protests against the far-right activist Milo Yiannopoulos at the University of California, Berkeley. But she never made it across the border. Canadian guards detained her overnight before turning her back to the US. Manning\u2019s support team have responded with astonishment to the suggestion by Canadian authorities that her prosecution under the US Espionage Act was equivalent to treason under Canadian law. They stressed that the Espionage Act was unprecedented around the world as it allows no margin for whistleblowers to argue that the disclosures they made were in the public interest. Manning\u2019s team said their concern now focused on whether Manning\u2019s experience with Canadian immigration officials would be replicated in other countries that might be susceptible to US government pressure. Manning has a number of international speaking engagements in development, and her team will now have to work out whether entry into those countries will be permitted. On Monday, Canada\u2019s Ministry of Immigration refused to comment on Manning\u2019s case, citing privacy laws. Each case is evaluated based on its merits, a spokesperson told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. \u201cAll applicants can expect impartial, professional treatment and clear, accountable decision-making.\u201d Speaking to media on Monday, Justin Trudeau also fielded questions about Manning\u2019s case. The prime minister declined to comment but said he was looking forward to hearing more details about the situation.",

          "body": "<p>\u2018Goodnight, honey,\u201d I say. \u201cGoodnight, sweetheart,\u201d my husband says. I turn over to go to sleep. He turns to the door to catch the train home.</p> <p>That has been my nightly routine for 25 years. Well, not every night. Occasionally, there\u2019s some reason John needs to be in my neighbourhood early in the morning. Or, now that we\u2019re old \u2013 correction: with our 29-year age gap, I\u2019m old, he\u2019s ancient \u2013 there\u2019s the issue of his knees, and if they\u2019re particularly bothersome, he might brave a night with me and our 15-year-old twin sons instead of the New York subway. But, for the most part, he arrives around 4pm, I make dinner for 6pm, we obsessively watch the news for a few hours (thank you, President Trump) and later in the night my husband goes to his apartment a couple of miles away.</p> <p>Here\u2019s what my marriage is. We have argued at Walmarts across America on vacations. We\u2019ve secretly congratulated ourselves on our stellar DNA when our son Henry brought home a chess trophy. We\u2019ve burned dinners, fretted about tax returns, held hands when we\u2019re too tired to do anything else, made hasty trips to the ER when the kids used the bed as a launchpad to nowhere. In other words, we\u2019ve had a marriage like any other. Except for this one thing: John and I have never lived together. Is that so strange?</p> <p>Depends who you ask.</p> <p>While I have blithely been living what I considered the most tediously conventional existence, I have somehow become cool, or at least part of <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/02/170209134257.htm\">a gently escalating trend</a>. The current infelicitous phrase, <a href=\"https://is.muni.cz/el/1423/jaro2006/SOC118/um/1177980/Levin.pdf\">coined in 2004 by sociologist Irene Levin</a>, is that I\u2019m part of an LAT couple, Living Apart Together. That is, two people who are married or in a long-term committed relationship who do not live under the same roof. (Canadian Sharon Hyman, who is directing a movie on the subject, has come up with a phrase guaranteed to appeal more to punsters: \u201c<a href=\"http://apartnersthemovie.com/APARTNERS.html\">apart-ners</a>.\u201d) Studies on the subject vary, and different countries define LAT differently. But a recent reckoning in the US estimates that 3.5 million Americans (3% of all married couples) are LAT. In the UK, where not just marriage but long-term partnerships are accounted for, that number rises to 9%.</p> <p>The Canadian government has looked at this phenomenon extensively, and determined that, as we get older, those LAT relationships became more and more non-transitional \u2013 that is, we became more sure that we are going to live separately and stay that way. Of course, Canadian researchers are failing to ask the critical question: \u201cWould you change your mind about living separately if you were moving in with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/justin-trudeau\">our prime minister</a>?\u201d That\u2019s the only way to really know how committed LATs are.</p> <p>It\u2019s not as if this is the most outlandish arrangement in the world. I used to say John and I were very <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/09/woody-allen-dylan-farrow-alleged-sexual-abuse\">Woody and Mia</a>, until that comparison lost its cachet. But still, historically there are many couples who made it work. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/anita-hill\">Anita Hill</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/margaret-drabble\">Margaret Drabble</a> are both known for having successful relationships with people who did not share their living space. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/timburton\">Tim Burton</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/helena-bonham-carter\">Helena Bonham Carter</a>. OK, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/24/helena-bonham-carter-and-tim-burton-announce-break-up\">they\u2019re divorced now</a>, but it worked for years, which counts as success. Then there were the intellectuals <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/19/polyamorous-women-simone-de-beauvoir-open-relationship-jean-paul-sartre\">Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre</a>, and the artists <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/mar/26/frida-kahlo-life-defiance-jay-griffiths-novel\">Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera</a>. Maybe the writer Robert Parker and his wife got it exactly right: <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/23/garden/at-home-with-joan-and-robert-b-parker-a-house-divided-lovingly.html\">they divorced and then got back together</a>, with the caveat that they create two entirely separate apartments in one huge home. They had to issue invitations to each other to visit. They also built a third kitchen, presumably the Switzerland of their residence.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The truth is, we don\u2019t agree on much, except each other</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I\u2019ve never understood why living separately is a big deal. I want the same love and commitment as anyone else; but why do I have to live in the same place to achieve it? Particularly if you find that you fundamentally love each other, but have very different ways of living and spending money. While John exhibits, shall we say, the frugality of his Scottish ancestors, he nevertheless likes decor that would be best suited to the set of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/downton-abbey\">Downton Abbey</a>: his uptown studio consists of two grand pianos and family furniture that I believe is haunted. I like stuff that is new, light and whimsical \u2013 I say whimsical, he says appalling. Why should I have to live without my light-up plastic owls if they give me pleasure? The truth is, we don\u2019t agree on much, except each other.</p> <p>Still, for most people, the idea of living separately just seems a bizarre fantasy. \u201cMy relationship is entirely co-dependent,\u201d one friend says. \u201cMy husband and I work together, every day, in my studio apartment, on the same couch. I don\u2019t even fantasise about getting my own apartment any more. I just fantasise about getting a door.\u201d</p> <p>But among those I know who are LAT, it\u2019s not some sort of grudging compromise. The people I know wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. \u201cThe thing most people ask me is, \u2018What is the longest you have been apart?\u2019\u201d says Ken Carlton, about his marriage to his wife, Geri Donenberg; she is a professor of medicine in Chicago, he a writer in Brooklyn. \u201cThe better question is, \u2018What is the longest you\u2019ve been together?\u2019 And that would be 10 days, on a recent vacation.\u201d It\u2019s a second marriage for both. While Jewish dating site <a href=\"https://www.jdate.com/en-us\">JDate</a> brought them new love, they had children from earlier marriages and jobs in different cities \u2013 not to mention independent spirits. So they stayed rooted, and have had weekly dates for the 12 years of their marriage.</p> <p>\u201cI think the secret is that, generally speaking, one is genuinely excited when you don\u2019t have to be together,\u201d says Tim, an executive in television sales from New York who has been with his partner, Mary, for six years in separate homes (and, yes, the fact that both came out of difficult marriages does play a role).</p> <p>For Lisa Church of San Francisco, who spent 10 years happily with her partner in separate homes \u2013 five years before having their daughter, Rena, five years after \u2013 \u201cit just felt right. We\u2019d both been married before, we both cherished alone time.\u201d Though they got more grief post-Rena, Church notes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6e93d10593e2975210d582d297b2ba10573b948c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e93d10593e2975210d582d297b2ba10573b948c/0_16_1063_1329/800.jpg\" alt=\"Judith Newman and her husband John\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>So did we. While living apart may have seemed kind of exotic to most friends pre-children, once I had twins, it became more suspect. Henry and Gus live downtown with me. Friends counselled me after the kids were born that now John would simply have to move in with me; after all, what would the children think? Well, the fact is, children don\u2019t think much at all about these things. Dad is around for dinner, and was there to put them to sleep. As they got older, their needs changed. John used to arrive ridiculously early in the morning to help me get them off to school, until that became insane; I\u2019ve done it now, happily, for years. (This is admittedly a luxury many don\u2019t have: I work at home, so it\u2019s not as if I have a mad single-mother scramble to get to my office.) We went on our share of family vacations, though the three of them are such homebodies that their best vacations, my sons admit now, were when I went away and their father stayed home with them.</p> <p>But when my son Gus was diagnosed with autism, the criticism from the outside world really ramped up. Now my older husband was not living with me for a very specific reason: because he couldn\u2019t stand to be around a disabled child. And I would have to explain, \u201cNope! It\u2019s just me he can\u2019t stand.\u201d (This isn\u2019t quite true either, but it does amuse me.)</p> <p>Gus plays no part in why we don\u2019t live together. Quite the opposite. Gus is our glue, and he, along with his neurotypical twin, Henry, is John\u2019s world. Moreover, Gus and his father\u2019s sensitivities are well matched. While my husband never received an official diagnosis of autism, it\u2019s safe to say he is not entirely neurotypical. Both Gus and his father are completely literal-minded: if you tell John, \u201cI\u2019ll call you back in a minute,\u201d he will sit by the phone for an hour with steam coming out of his ears because, well, you said a minute. Both hate noise. Gus and John are both fastidious, and are pained at my sloppiness and general clutter. The only unfortunate part of this scenario is that Gus has to live with me. There was never a discussion about the twins living with John \u2013 he has a studio apartment.</p> <p>My arrangement has sometimes been a source of envy, and sometimes pity. \u201cOh, that\u2019s fine for those who can afford it,\u201d sniffed one acquaintance, years ago. She lived in a midwest suburb. I didn\u2019t want to explain to her the exigencies of living in Manhattan; that, actually, given how long ago we\u2019d acquired our separate apartments, moving in together would have involved less space for much more money.</p> <p>***</p> <p>If people tend to assume you\u2019re wealthy if you live separately, there\u2019s one other assumption that\u2019s even more prevalent about LATs. It\u2019s even an assumption my own son has made. One night recently, John needed to stay over; he had a doctor\u2019s appointment near me early in the morning. Gus does not like his routine interrupted and was trying to usher John out the door at his usual time. But Henry is a neurotypical teenage boy, and has other things on his mind. When John and I headed to bed, my room had been turned into a massive fire hazard. Henry had found candles, including precariously propped-up birthday candles, and dug out a couple of glasses and some cheap white wine. Clearly, he was a little worried about his parents\u2019 capacity for romance.</p> <p>He needn\u2019t have worried. Several years ago, a survey of 2,500 couples conducted by Dietrich Klusmann at the University of Hamburg showed that, while lust between men and women is pretty equal at first, a woman\u2019s desire begins to decline steadily after the first year, and continues to do so as the relationship progresses. The exception? Women who don\u2019t live with their partners: they retain desire much longer and more intensely than those who cohabit.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I had been married 10 years before I discovered my husband had no front teeth</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And is it really such a surprise that those of us who do not see our mates\u2019 intimate personal habits every day might have a slightly more romanticised view of them? Indeed, I think I had been married 10 years before I discovered my husband had no front teeth, the result of an unfortunate mountain-climbing accident in his 20s. He took out the bridge and I was a little unprepared. You may have heard my shriek. As far as I\u2019m concerned, those innocent 10 years were good ones.</p> <p>I\u2019m not going to say the LAT lifestyle doesn\u2019t have its drawbacks. A friend who lives in New Jersey and has never lived with her husband acknowledged the positives \u2013 privacy, autonomy, absence making the heart grow fonder/not taking each other for granted, the ability to have opposing preferences without fighting \u2013 while clearly delineating the negatives, too: \u201clack of meaningful time together, hard to create traditional family atmosphere for children, constant running back and forth for the thing you left in the other place that you suddenly need.\u201d Those things are often tiny but critical. The night before, the annoyance involved making a special dinner and realising she did not have a garlic press in both homes. For John, the biggest nuisance is his creakiness: the travelling back and forth is not always so great. There may be a time when we have to make the ultimate compromise if he finds the daily trip too burdensome. But not yet. We\u2019re both content.</p> <p>I believe that I would not be married if we had lived together, and moreover, that if more people lived separately, marriages would be saved. \u201cThis is the way the world ends, not with a bang but a whimper,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fu8awT5Jzs\">TS Eliot wrote</a>, and the same could be said of many marriages. It\u2019s the whimper of the quotidian that often grinds us to a nub. I think about writer Debra Nussbaum Cohen, who wrote this about her own LAT dreams on Facebook: \u201cIt is a fantasy of mine to be able to look forward to being together rather than aggravated by each other\u2019s tics and habits.\u201d</p> <p>There were quite a few (virtual) sympathetic nods after Nussbaum\u2019s comment; a few others had actually tried to set up LAT arrangements and failed. \u201cA committed relationship in two houses was my objective in my last serious relationship,\u201d noted one woman, a content strategist in Colorado. \u201cI liked the idea of individual spaces... he couldn\u2019t wrap his head around it. Even though he didn\u2019t like my daughter and I didn\u2019t like his dog, to him, my need for space showed that I didn\u2019t care; it was 24/7 or nothing. He chose nothing and now I feel I dodged a bullet.\u201d</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/All-Nothing-Marriage-Best-Marriages/dp/052595516X\">The All-Or-Nothing Marriage</a>, Northwestern University professor of psychology Eli J Finkel cites several studies that point to how solid LAT relationships can be. In one study, the sociologist Charles Strohm showed that Americans who live apart perceive just as much emotional support from their partner as those who live together. Another researcher, Birk Hagemeyer, suggests that some people benefit more than others from living apart, specifically, those who want love but are nevertheless slightly cranky loners.</p> <p>\u201cAlthough having an independent personality predicts lower relationship quality on average, that\u2019s not the case when people live apart,\u201d Finkel writes. \u201cAnd although spending more time with one\u2019s partner is linked to greater relationship satisfaction among independent people who live apart, it is linked to lower relationship satisfaction among independent people who live together.\u201d</p> <p>Translation: if you\u2019re like me or my husband, you live together at your peril.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Make no mistake: we\u2019ve had our bad periods. It\u2019s a marriage. But it\u2019s living separately that has saved us. Because, if there is space, there is consideration. In 25 years of marriage, neither of us has said something so heinous that it cannot be unsaid. And that is simply because when we are angry, we are not forced to look at each other and swell with hatred. Absence not only makes the heart grow fonder, it makes that heart slow down.</p> <p>Living separately has been a critical tool in our arsenal to make marriage work. And we both knew, without explicit discussion: separate apartments don\u2019t mean separate lives. Our lives are just as enmeshed as anyone else\u2019s, even if we don\u2019t have to consult each other about what curtains we want to buy or whether my tendency to play <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/mar/23/gloria-gaynors-i-will-survive-library-of-congress\">Gloria Gaynor</a> at top volume is joyous or, as John has put it, \u201ca soul-destroying experience\u201d.</p> <p>To those who say I am missing out on the intimacy of a true relationship, I can say only this: we all have different ways of experiencing intimacy. If my husband were run over by a bus tomorrow, I would very much want to be married again. I love being married. I love having that special one person in my life. I just can\u2019t imagine wanting to do it again under the same roof, however large that roof may be.</p> <p>Unless it\u2019s the Canadian prime minster.

          "bodyText": "\u2018Goodnight, honey,\u201d I say. \u201cGoodnight, sweetheart,\u201d my husband says. I turn over to go to sleep. He turns to the door to catch the train home. That has been my nightly routine for 25 years. Well, not every night. Occasionally, there\u2019s some reason John needs to be in my neighbourhood early in the morning. Or, now that we\u2019re old \u2013 correction: with our 29-year age gap, I\u2019m old, he\u2019s ancient \u2013 there\u2019s the issue of his knees, and if they\u2019re particularly bothersome, he might brave a night with me and our 15-year-old twin sons instead of the New York subway. But, for the most part, he arrives around 4pm, I make dinner for 6pm, we obsessively watch the news for a few hours (thank you, President Trump) and later in the night my husband goes to his apartment a couple of miles away. Here\u2019s what my marriage is. We have argued at Walmarts across America on vacations. We\u2019ve secretly congratulated ourselves on our stellar DNA when our son Henry brought home a chess trophy. We\u2019ve burned dinners, fretted about tax returns, held hands when we\u2019re too tired to do anything else, made hasty trips to the ER when the kids used the bed as a launchpad to nowhere. In other words, we\u2019ve had a marriage like any other. Except for this one thing: John and I have never lived together. Is that so strange? Depends who you ask. While I have blithely been living what I considered the most tediously conventional existence, I have somehow become cool, or at least part of a gently escalating trend. The current infelicitous phrase, coined in 2004 by sociologist Irene Levin, is that I\u2019m part of an LAT couple, Living Apart Together. That is, two people who are married or in a long-term committed relationship who do not live under the same roof. (Canadian Sharon Hyman, who is directing a movie on the subject, has come up with a phrase guaranteed to appeal more to punsters: \u201capart-ners.\u201d) Studies on the subject vary, and different countries define LAT differently. But a recent reckoning in the US estimates that 3.5 million Americans (3% of all married couples) are LAT. In the UK, where not just marriage but long-term partnerships are accounted for, that number rises to 9%. The Canadian government has looked at this phenomenon extensively, and determined that, as we get older, those LAT relationships became more and more non-transitional \u2013 that is, we became more sure that we are going to live separately and stay that way. Of course, Canadian researchers are failing to ask the critical question: \u201cWould you change your mind about living separately if you were moving in with our prime minister?\u201d That\u2019s the only way to really know how committed LATs are. It\u2019s not as if this is the most outlandish arrangement in the world. I used to say John and I were very Woody and Mia, until that comparison lost its cachet. But still, historically there are many couples who made it work. Anita Hill and Margaret Drabble are both known for having successful relationships with people who did not share their living space. Tim Burton and Helena Bonham Carter. OK, they\u2019re divorced now, but it worked for years, which counts as success. Then there were the intellectuals Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre, and the artists Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera. Maybe the writer Robert Parker and his wife got it exactly right: they divorced and then got back together, with the caveat that they create two entirely separate apartments in one huge home. They had to issue invitations to each other to visit. They also built a third kitchen, presumably the Switzerland of their residence. I\u2019ve never understood why living separately is a big deal. I want the same love and commitment as anyone else; but why do I have to live in the same place to achieve it? Particularly if you find that you fundamentally love each other, but have very different ways of living and spending money. While John exhibits, shall we say, the frugality of his Scottish ancestors, he nevertheless likes decor that would be best suited to the set of Downton Abbey: his uptown studio consists of two grand pianos and family furniture that I believe is haunted. I like stuff that is new, light and whimsical \u2013 I say whimsical, he says appalling. Why should I have to live without my light-up plastic owls if they give me pleasure? The truth is, we don\u2019t agree on much, except each other. Still, for most people, the idea of living separately just seems a bizarre fantasy. \u201cMy relationship is entirely co-dependent,\u201d one friend says. \u201cMy husband and I work together, every day, in my studio apartment, on the same couch. I don\u2019t even fantasise about getting my own apartment any more. I just fantasise about getting a door.\u201d But among those I know who are LAT, it\u2019s not some sort of grudging compromise. The people I know wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. \u201cThe thing most people ask me is, \u2018What is the longest you have been apart?\u2019\u201d says Ken Carlton, about his marriage to his wife, Geri Donenberg; she is a professor of medicine in Chicago, he a writer in Brooklyn. \u201cThe better question is, \u2018What is the longest you\u2019ve been together?\u2019 And that would be 10 days, on a recent vacation.\u201d It\u2019s a second marriage for both. While Jewish dating site JDate brought them new love, they had children from earlier marriages and jobs in different cities \u2013 not to mention independent spirits. So they stayed rooted, and have had weekly dates for the 12 years of their marriage. \u201cI think the secret is that, generally speaking, one is genuinely excited when you don\u2019t have to be together,\u201d says Tim, an executive in television sales from New York who has been with his partner, Mary, for six years in separate homes (and, yes, the fact that both came out of difficult marriages does play a role). For Lisa Church of San Francisco, who spent 10 years happily with her partner in separate homes \u2013 five years before having their daughter, Rena, five years after \u2013 \u201cit just felt right. We\u2019d both been married before, we both cherished alone time.\u201d Though they got more grief post-Rena, Church notes. So did we. While living apart may have seemed kind of exotic to most friends pre-children, once I had twins, it became more suspect. Henry and Gus live downtown with me. Friends counselled me after the kids were born that now John would simply have to move in with me; after all, what would the children think? Well, the fact is, children don\u2019t think much at all about these things. Dad is around for dinner, and was there to put them to sleep. As they got older, their needs changed. John used to arrive ridiculously early in the morning to help me get them off to school, until that became insane; I\u2019ve done it now, happily, for years. (This is admittedly a luxury many don\u2019t have: I work at home, so it\u2019s not as if I have a mad single-mother scramble to get to my office.) We went on our share of family vacations, though the three of them are such homebodies that their best vacations, my sons admit now, were when I went away and their father stayed home with them. But when my son Gus was diagnosed with autism, the criticism from the outside world really ramped up. Now my older husband was not living with me for a very specific reason: because he couldn\u2019t stand to be around a disabled child. And I would have to explain, \u201cNope! It\u2019s just me he can\u2019t stand.\u201d (This isn\u2019t quite true either, but it does amuse me.) Gus plays no part in why we don\u2019t live together. Quite the opposite. Gus is our glue, and he, along with his neurotypical twin, Henry, is John\u2019s world. Moreover, Gus and his father\u2019s sensitivities are well matched. While my husband never received an official diagnosis of autism, it\u2019s safe to say he is not entirely neurotypical. Both Gus and his father are completely literal-minded: if you tell John, \u201cI\u2019ll call you back in a minute,\u201d he will sit by the phone for an hour with steam coming out of his ears because, well, you said a minute. Both hate noise. Gus and John are both fastidious, and are pained at my sloppiness and general clutter. The only unfortunate part of this scenario is that Gus has to live with me. There was never a discussion about the twins living with John \u2013 he has a studio apartment. My arrangement has sometimes been a source of envy, and sometimes pity. \u201cOh, that\u2019s fine for those who can afford it,\u201d sniffed one acquaintance, years ago. She lived in a midwest suburb. I didn\u2019t want to explain to her the exigencies of living in Manhattan; that, actually, given how long ago we\u2019d acquired our separate apartments, moving in together would have involved less space for much more money. *** If people tend to assume you\u2019re wealthy if you live separately, there\u2019s one other assumption that\u2019s even more prevalent about LATs. It\u2019s even an assumption my own son has made. One night recently, John needed to stay over; he had a doctor\u2019s appointment near me early in the morning. Gus does not like his routine interrupted and was trying to usher John out the door at his usual time. But Henry is a neurotypical teenage boy, and has other things on his mind. When John and I headed to bed, my room had been turned into a massive fire hazard. Henry had found candles, including precariously propped-up birthday candles, and dug out a couple of glasses and some cheap white wine. Clearly, he was a little worried about his parents\u2019 capacity for romance. He needn\u2019t have worried. Several years ago, a survey of 2,500 couples conducted by Dietrich Klusmann at the University of Hamburg showed that, while lust between men and women is pretty equal at first, a woman\u2019s desire begins to decline steadily after the first year, and continues to do so as the relationship progresses. The exception? Women who don\u2019t live with their partners: they retain desire much longer and more intensely than those who cohabit. And is it really such a surprise that those of us who do not see our mates\u2019 intimate personal habits every day might have a slightly more romanticised view of them? Indeed, I think I had been married 10 years before I discovered my husband had no front teeth, the result of an unfortunate mountain-climbing accident in his 20s. He took out the bridge and I was a little unprepared. You may have heard my shriek. As far as I\u2019m concerned, those innocent 10 years were good ones. I\u2019m not going to say the LAT lifestyle doesn\u2019t have its drawbacks. A friend who lives in New Jersey and has never lived with her husband acknowledged the positives \u2013 privacy, autonomy, absence making the heart grow fonder/not taking each other for granted, the ability to have opposing preferences without fighting \u2013 while clearly delineating the negatives, too: \u201clack of meaningful time together, hard to create traditional family atmosphere for children, constant running back and forth for the thing you left in the other place that you suddenly need.\u201d Those things are often tiny but critical. The night before, the annoyance involved making a special dinner and realising she did not have a garlic press in both homes. For John, the biggest nuisance is his creakiness: the travelling back and forth is not always so great. There may be a time when we have to make the ultimate compromise if he finds the daily trip too burdensome. But not yet. We\u2019re both content. I believe that I would not be married if we had lived together, and moreover, that if more people lived separately, marriages would be saved. \u201cThis is the way the world ends, not with a bang but a whimper,\u201d TS Eliot wrote, and the same could be said of many marriages. It\u2019s the whimper of the quotidian that often grinds us to a nub.

It\u2019s a marriage. But it\u2019s living separately that has saved us. Because, if there is space, there is consideration.

It contained no significant, newsy announcements, no great personal revelations or stylistic surprises and it did not point the Liberal Democrats in a fresh direction.</p> <p>But a no-news speech isn\u2019t necessarily a bad speech. There was an inherent seriousness about this that was gratifying, and it was refreshingly free of the slogany guff that usually pollutes party leaders\u2019 speeches. If you are at all interested in the Lib Dems, or centre ground politics, it is worth a read.</p> <p>Here are the main points.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Cable said he did not want the Lib Dems to be seen as a single issue party.</strong> Although he devoted a large part of his speech to Brexit, and to the Lib Dems\u2019 determination to be seen as \u201cthe party of remain\u201d, he also spoke at length about domestic policy and said that he did not want the Lib Dems to be defined purely through the prism of Europe.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are not a single-issue party \u2026 We\u2019re not Ukip in reverse. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He insisted that the Lib Dems could form a government and that he could prime minister.</strong> He first raised this about half way through the speech, saying:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Our party is not just a coalition partner of the past, we are the government of the future.</p> <p>And my role, as your leader, is to be a credible potential prime minister.</p> </blockquote> <p>And he finished his speech by saying:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I am ready to take our message out to the country, and I ask you to join me on the journey as we, together, take the Liberal Democrats back to government.</p> </blockquote> <p>Cable also pointed out that his shadow cabinet contained 10 former ministers, including three former cabinet ministers. By contrast, there were \u201conly two people who have been anywhere near cabinet\u201d in Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s shadow ministerial team, he claimed.</p> <p>When it was put to Lib Dem aides that the idea of Cable forming a government after the last election seemed wholly unrealistic, one said that politics has \u201cspeeded up\u201d recently and that at one point the idea of Emmanuel Macron becoming French president would have been equally improbable. Another said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You can scoff and say it is unlikely. But some pretty unlikely things have happened. And this [Cable] is a guy who has a track record of doing some unlikely things.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said that he was appointing the former Lib Dem MP David Howarth to look at the case for replacing tuition fees with a graduate tax.</strong> He suggested that the problem for the Lib Dems with the coalition\u2019s decision to raise tuition fees to \u00a39,000 was not so much the policy as the fact that it broke a pre-election promise. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/sep/19/boris-johnson-deserves-to-be-sacked-for-his-brexit-disloyalty-says-ken-clarke-politics-live?page=with:block-59c129f9e4b0f6beafd39bfd#block-59c129f9e4b0f6beafd39bfd\">3.32pm.)</a> He said the current tuition fee policy already \u201coperates like a tax. But it was not seen as one, he said.</li> </ul> <blockquote> <p>Yet just because the system operates like a tax, we cannot escape the fact it isn\u2019t seen as one \u2026</p> <p>\u2026 the worry about debt does cause students and their families real concern. </p> <p>Escalating student loan interest rates add to that concern.</p> <p>And many universities are obsessed with getting bums on seats rather than giving students value for money.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He floated the idea of giving all young people a learning account to pay for university or training. </strong>This could be funded by higher wealth taxes, he suggested.</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>One idea I want to develop with you \u2013 with the party \u2013 is finding a way to support all young people in future with an endowment or learning account, which they can use at any stage in life, helping to finance further or higher education, either at the post-18 stage or later in life.</p> <p>It is a fundamentally liberal idea, handing control to the individual, and I want to explore how it can be sustainably financed through fair taxation of wealth.</p> </blockquote> <p>Cable did not elaborate on how this might be funded by \u201cfair taxation of wealth\u201d, but he did explore the idea in more detail<a href=\"https://www.libdems.org.uk/cable-inequality-full-speech-060915\"> in a recent speech to the Resolution Foundation on inequality.</a> Here is an extract where he identified loopholes in current wealth taxes. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The present system is a patchwork of different taxes, all flawed in different ways and full of loopholes. Inheritance tax allowances have grown more generous reflecting house price inflation and there is considerable scope for avoidance through gift before death. Capital gains tax too has a plethora of reliefs. Britain has no tax on property values as such and council tax serves as a very unsatisfactory substitute based on ancient property values and not proportional to property or land values. One could add various wealth related charges like stamp duty. Together these taxes raise around \u00a350 bn a year of which half is council tax: representing, overall, half of one percent of household net wealth.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He called for more public investment, saying \u201cnever in British economic history has it been cheaper for a bold, active government to borrow for productive investment\u201d.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He said he wanted higher taxes for foreigners buying property in the UK for investment, and measures to curb \u201cabsentee second home ownership\u201d.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I want to see fierce tax penalties on the acquisition of property for investment purposes, by overseas residents.</p> <p>And I want to see rural communities protected from the blight of absentee second home ownership, which devastates local economies and pushes young people away from the places where they grew up. </p> </blockquote> <p>Boris Johnson also floated the idea of raising taxes for foreigners buying property in the UK after Brexit in his Telegraph article last week.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Cable renewed his call for a referendum on the final Brexit deal.</strong> (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/sep/19/boris-johnson-deserves-to-be-sacked-for-his-brexit-disloyalty-says-ken-clarke-politics-live?page=with:block-59c0edc1e4b021abf31618e1#block-59c0edc1e4b021abf31618e1\"> 11.25am.)</a></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He said the Lib Dems had taken the correct stance on \u201cthe three great disasters perpetrated by the two main parties in recent years\u201d: the Iraq war, the banking crash and Brexit.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He claimed a Labour government would be financially irresponsible.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote> <p>What would a Corbyn government look like? </p> <p>Their basic appeal is to offer something for nothing.

The Scottish government is likely to give way on many topics in that list of 111 but will battle hard over others, such as fracking, GMOs, rail franchises, EU citizens voting \u2013 because that could affect voting rights in a future Scottish independence referendum, and economic investment.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59c1130fe4b0c1d591831f9c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-09-19T12:59:34.913Z\">1.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Boris Johnson was for many years a journalist and prize columnist at the Daily Telegraph, and so when it publishes a story about his private intentions on the resignation front (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/sep/19/boris-johnson-deserves-to-be-sacked-for-his-brexit-disloyalty-says-ken-clarke-politics-live?page=with:block-59c109f0e4b0c1d591831f7d#block-59c109f0e4b0c1d591831f7d\">1.22pm)</a>, it is worth taking it seriously.</p> <p>But Johnson also has a close association with the Spectator, of which he used to be editor.

This is where he and Johnson part company. Hague says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is complete common sense that [businesses] need time to adapt and, as the CBI and others have pointed out, only one upheaval rather than two. Having a big change in customs, tariffs and regulations to enter a transition phase and then another one perhaps two years later is a nightmare if you are importing or exporting.</p> <p>The lesson of this is that it is very much worth going for a simple deal with the EU, with a couple of years when we stay in the single market and customs union and then have enough time to settle a good free trade deal.</p> <p>Doesn\u2019t that involve still paying into the EU?

They contain an allowance of almost \u00a3250m per week \u2014 not \u00a3350m \u2014 for funding that could in principle go to the NHS rather than the EU. But this would involve no state support for any other activities, such as subsidies for agriculture, that are at present funded in the UK by the EU.</p> <p>The bigger picture is that the forecast health of the public finances was downgraded by \u00a315bn per year \u2014 or almost \u00a3300m per week \u2014 as a direct result of the Brexit vote. Not only will we not regain control of \u00a3350m weekly as a result of Brexit, we are likely to make a net fiscal loss from it. Those are the numbers and forecasts which the government has adopted. It is perhaps surprising that members of the government are suggesting rather different figures.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-09-19T08:39:10.785Z\">at 9.39am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-59c0ca79e4b021abf316183c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-09-19T08:09:33.672Z\">9.09am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Ken Clarke's Today interview - Summary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is a full summary of the best lines from <strong>Ken Clarke</strong>\u2019s interview on Today.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Clarke, the Conservative former chancellor, said that Boris Johnson deserved to be sacked for his Brexit disloyalty.</strong> He said Johnson\u2019s Telegraph article on Brexit policy was an \u201cirrelevant nuisance\u201d and that the claim he made about Brexit making an extra \u00a3350m available for the NHS was \u201csimplistic and dishonest\u201d.

Describing Johnson\u2019s intervention as an \u201cirrelevant nuisance\u201d and \u201cdishonest\u201d, he said that Johnson would have been sacked for what he did, if it were not for the fact that May was in such a weak position. He told the Today programme:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Personal publicity and campaigning by the foreign secretary is actually just an irrelevant nuisance. I think people have already said quite enough about somebody who is the foreign secretary just joining in a few days before and repeating one of the more simplistic and dishonest arguments of the hardline leavers during the referendum campaign ...</p> <p>They should tell him that if he wants to be foreign secretary, he should actually make some more serious contributions on wider foreign policy, give his views on the Brexit deal privately, as ministers have always been supposed to do, and remember that there [is] what is called collective responsibility. Sounding off personally in this way is totally unhelpful, and he should not exploit the fact that [Theresa May] has not got a majority in parliament and he knows perfectly well that, although normally a foreign secretary would be sacked for doing that, she unfortunately after the general election is not in a position to sack him. But he should stop exploiting it ...</p> <p>In any normal circumstances, he would have been sacked the day after.</p> </blockquote> <p>Clarke\u2019s intervention came after another Tory grandee, the former Tory leader and former foreign secretary <strong>William Hague</strong>, used<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/09/18/no-point-tories-arguing-should-pm-rate-will-jeremy-corbyn/\"> his Telegraph column (paywall)</a> to say that, if the party could not unite and agree a Brexit strategy, they would hand power to Labour. Hague said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>More bluntly, it is now 15 months since the referendum, and high time that all members of the government were able to express themselves on this subject in the same way as each other, putting forward the same points, as part of an agreed plan.</p> <p>Hopefully, that happy circumstance will follow the speech the prime minister is due to give on the subject in Florence on Friday.</p> <p>If not, there will be no point Conservatives discussing who is going to be the foreign secretary, chancellor or prime minister in the coming years, because Jeremy Corbyn will be prime minister, sitting in Number 10 with John McDonnell and Diane Abbott, completely ruining this country.</p> </blockquote> <p>I\u2019m in Bournemouth today for the final day of the Lib Dem conference, where Sir Vince Cable will be delivering his first conference speech as leader.

          "bodyText": "The Lib Dem leader always struggles to get much of a hearing in British politics. It gets harder when you have just 12 MPs. And if your conference speech coincides with Boris Johnson coming close to the brink of resignation, and President Trump talking about totally destroying North Korea, you\u2019re not going to grab the headlines. Even with an empty news schedule, Sir Vince Cable\u2019s first speech would not have made it to the top of the bulletins. It contained no significant, newsy announcements, no great personal revelations or stylistic surprises and it did not point the Liberal Democrats in a fresh direction. But a no-news speech isn\u2019t necessarily a bad speech. There was an inherent seriousness about this that was gratifying, and it was refreshingly free of the slogany guff that usually pollutes party leaders\u2019 speeches. If you are at all interested in the Lib Dems, or centre ground politics, it is worth a read. Here are the main points. Cable said he did not want the Lib Dems to be seen as a single issue party. Although he devoted a large part of his speech to Brexit, and to the Lib Dems\u2019 determination to be seen as \u201cthe party of remain\u201d, he also spoke at length about domestic policy and said that he did not want the Lib Dems to be defined purely through the prism of Europe. We are not a single-issue party \u2026 We\u2019re not Ukip in reverse. He insisted that the Lib Dems could form a government and that he could prime minister. He first raised this about half way through the speech, saying: Our party is not just a coalition partner of the past, we are the government of the future. And my role, as your leader, is to be a credible potential prime minister. And he finished his speech by saying: I am ready to take our message out to the country, and I ask you to join me on the journey as we, together, take the Liberal Democrats back to government. Cable also pointed out that his shadow cabinet contained 10 former ministers, including three former cabinet ministers. By contrast, there were \u201conly two people who have been anywhere near cabinet\u201d in Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s shadow ministerial team, he claimed. When it was put to Lib Dem aides that the idea of Cable forming a government after the last election seemed wholly unrealistic, one said that politics has \u201cspeeded up\u201d recently and that at one point the idea of Emmanuel Macron becoming French president would have been equally improbable. Another said: You can scoff and say it is unlikely. But some pretty unlikely things have happened. And this [Cable] is a guy who has a track record of doing some unlikely things. He said that he was appointing the former Lib Dem MP David Howarth to look at the case for replacing tuition fees with a graduate tax. He suggested that the problem for the Lib Dems with the coalition\u2019s decision to raise tuition fees to \u00a39,000 was not so much the policy as the fact that it broke a pre-election promise. (See 3.32pm.) He said the current tuition fee policy already \u201coperates like a tax. But it was not seen as one, he said. Yet just because the system operates like a tax, we cannot escape the fact it isn\u2019t seen as one \u2026 \u2026 the worry about debt does cause students and their families real concern. Escalating student loan interest rates add to that concern. And many universities are obsessed with getting bums on seats rather than giving students value for money. He floated the idea of giving all young people a learning account to pay for university or training. This could be funded by higher wealth taxes, he suggested. One idea I want to develop with you \u2013 with the party \u2013 is finding a way to support all young people in future with an endowment or learning account, which they can use at any stage in life, helping to finance further or higher education, either at the post-18 stage or later in life. It is a fundamentally liberal idea, handing control to the individual, and I want to explore how it can be sustainably financed through fair taxation of wealth. Cable did not elaborate on how this might be funded by \u201cfair taxation of wealth\u201d, but he did explore the idea in more detail in a recent speech to the Resolution Foundation on inequality. Here is an extract where he identified loopholes in current wealth taxes. He said: The present system is a patchwork of different taxes, all flawed in different ways and full of loopholes. Inheritance tax allowances have grown more generous reflecting house price inflation and there is considerable scope for avoidance through gift before death. Capital gains tax too has a plethora of reliefs. Britain has no tax on property values as such and council tax serves as a very unsatisfactory substitute based on ancient property values and not proportional to property or land values. One could add various wealth related charges like stamp duty. Together these taxes raise around \u00a350 bn a year of which half is council tax: representing, overall, half of one percent of household net wealth. He called for more public investment, saying \u201cnever in British economic history has it been cheaper for a bold, active government to borrow for productive investment\u201d. He said he wanted higher taxes for foreigners buying property in the UK for investment, and measures to curb \u201cabsentee second home ownership\u201d. I want to see fierce tax penalties on the acquisition of property for investment purposes, by overseas residents. And I want to see rural communities protected from the blight of absentee second home ownership, which devastates local economies and pushes young people away from the places where they grew up. Boris Johnson also floated the idea of raising taxes for foreigners buying property in the UK after Brexit in his Telegraph article last week. Cable renewed his call for a referendum on the final Brexit deal. (See 11.25am.) He said the Lib Dems had taken the correct stance on \u201cthe three great disasters perpetrated by the two main parties in recent years\u201d: the Iraq war, the banking crash and Brexit. He claimed a Labour government would be financially irresponsible. What would a Corbyn government look like? Their basic appeal is to offer something for nothing. All paid for by someone else. For them budgeting is just a bourgeois hobby ... Money and priorities define the crucial difference between us and Labour. We understand that to govern is to choose. And they don\u2019t. He confirmed that the Lib Dems would raise income tax by 1p in the pound to raise \u00a36bn extra for the NHS. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Here is my colleague Jessica Elgot\u2019s story about Vince Cable\u2019s speech. Cable is now winding up. Only the Liberal Democrats have the ideas, the experience and the commitment to transform the fortunes of our country. An exit from Brexit. A grown-up approach to the economy. And bold ideas to strengthen our society through the 21st century. I am ready to take our message out to the country \u2026 \u2026 and I ask you to join me on the journey as we, together, take the Liberal Democrats .. \u2026 back to government. I will post a summary soon. Cable says he knows the value of endurance. Success is often laced with setback. I reflect on one of the most difficult periods of my life, when many of you will know that I lost my first wife. In time, I recovered and I found a new partnership with Rachel. She has sustained and supported me ever since. Her energy and dedication to me is the source of my energy and dedication to this party. And politics has proved an even greater waiting game than life. I had to wait 30 years from my first campaign to win a seat in Parliament. I had to wait two years to return, after the setback in 2015. But now, friends, the time for waiting is over. Cable says votes at 16 are at the centre of Lib Dem demands for political reform. And he calls for more diversity in the Lib Dems. I demonstrated in government a commitment to this issue by working with women in business to achieve a demanding target for women on the boards of top companies. I am committed to similar ambition in our own party. We have even further to travel in ensuring that we have proper Black, Asian and Minority representation at all levels. Cable says he will review tuition fee policy, with a view to replacing tuition fees with a graduate tax. We all know we suffered grievous political harm from making a pledge seven years ago on tuition fees that we couldn\u2019t meet. The problem hasn\u2019t gone away. We are faced with a fundamental dilemma. The changes we made in government ensured universities are properly funded. And it is right that the most highly paid graduates pay most; those who earn least pay nothing at all. Yet just because the system operates like a tax, we cannot escape the fact it isn\u2019t seen as one \u2026 \u2026 the worry about debt does cause students and their families real concern. Escalating student loan interest rates add to that concern. And many universities are obsessed with getting bums on seats rather than giving students value for money. I have therefore launched a review, led by former Cambridge MP David Howarth, which will recommend options for reform, including a graduate tax. Cable turns to housing. Home ownership, which spread wealth for generations, is no longer a realistic prospect for younger people with moderate means. To put this right, we must end the stranglehold of oligarchs and speculators in our housing market. I want to see fierce tax penalties on the acquisition of property for investment purposes, by overseas residents. And I want to see rural communities protected from the blight of absentee second home ownership, which devastates local economies and pushes young people away from the places where they grew up. Homes are to live in; they\u2019re not pieces on a Monopoly board. And he says councils should be allowed to borrow to build new council homes. It is utterly absurd that councils are allowed to borrow to speculate in commercial property \u2026 \u2026 but are stopped from borrowing to build affordable council houses. This triumph of ideological dogma over common sense must stop. Cable says he wants the Lib Dems to be pro-business and pro-enterprise. The Conservatives have given up on business, he says. Growing numbers have given up on the Conservative Party, because they know it has abandoned British business. Their home is now with us. But the Lib Dems also believe in challenging market power, he says. It\u2019s not a coincidence that the only body strong enough to stand up to Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Facebook is the European Commission. Does anybody seriously believe that a post-Brexit British government will doanything other than roll over when the big boys in come looking for favours or dodging taxes at will? Cable says Britain needs more public investment. This country needs a massive injection of public investment. \u2026 in the railway network \u2013 across the north of England and the Midlands to Wales and the South West. \u2026 and in broadband. \u2026 and in housing. Every pound spent building modern Britain will be returned many times over. Never in British economic history has it been cheaper for a bold, active government to borrow for productive investment, alongside the private sector. Cable says Britain needs to do more for the 60% of young people who do not go to university. I hope you will indulge me if I explain a bit of family history which shows why I care passionately about this subject. My own parents left school at 15 to work in factories in York. My father went to night school and qualified to teach building trades at a further education college. He and I fell out over his right-wing politics but I never lost my admiration for his life\u2019s work with skilled workers, technicians, craftsmen; people that we now desperately lack. He floats the idea of giving all young people a learning account, funded by wealth taxes. One idea I want to develop with you \u2013 with the party \u2013 is finding a way to support all young people in future with an endowment or learning account, which they can use at any stage in life \u2026. \u2026 helping to finance further or higher education, either at the post-18 stage or later in life. It is a fundamentally liberal idea, handing control to the individual, and I want to explore how it can be sustainably financed through fair taxation of wealth. Under my leadership, our party will be the champions of lifelong learning, giving everyone a chance of self-improvement and employment at every stage in life. Cable highlights what he thinks Britain needs. While France is modernising, Britain is lurching down a nostalgic cul-de-sac of Brexit. And Britain\u2019s strengths \u2013 and there are real, considerable strengths, its openness to trade, people, ideas, its world class universities and inventiveness. These things are being put at risk. What the country needs \u2026 more investment; more innovation; more training and retraining; more patient, long term capital; the renaissance of manufacturing and the nurturing of creative industries; the greening of the economy. To achieve these things requires overcoming the petty tribalism and short termism which are the bane of British politics. Cable says the Lib Dems understand that \u201cgo govern is to choose\u201d. He reaffirms their commitment to increasing income tax by 1p in the pound to raise \u00a36bn for the NHS. And he says the Lib Dems offer \u201chope and realism\u201d. In a Britain increasingly dominated by extremists and ideologues, I want us to fill the huge gap in the centre of British politics. Liberal Democrats have always grappled with the big challenges facing our country and our world. I am determined that, to meet them, our party will once again become a workshop for new ideas. Cable says Labour\u2019s basic appeal \u201cis to offer something for nothing\u201d. What would a Corbyn government look like? Their basic appeal is to offer something for nothing. All paid for by someone else. For them budgeting is just a bourgeois hobby. I first encountered this politics of free things as a young Treasury official in Kenya. President Kenyatta \u2013 the father \u2013 faced defeat in an election against an opposition offering lots of freebies: free food, free land, free cows, free cars. He turned to my department for help. We came up with a winning slogan \u2013 Hapana Chakula Kabisa. Roughly translated it meant: there is no such thing as a free lunch. (Unless of course it is a Lib Dem free school lunch!) Cable says the Lib Dems have more experience than Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s team. I do have one great advantage over Jeremy Corbyn. I have a great team: our shadow cabinet has 10 former ministers, 3 of whom served in cabinet. And I\u2019m proud that one of them is now our superb deputy leader, Jo Swinson. My team has been bloodied in the difficult business of government. By contrast, in a parliamentary party of 262 MPs, Jeremy Corbyn can find only two people who have been anywhere near cabinet, to serve in his alternative administration. Cable says the Lib Dems are a government of the future. So yes, I want our party to lead the fight against Brexit. But we should not be consumed by Brexit to the exclusion of everything else. We are not a single-issue party \u2026 we\u2019re not Ukip in reverse. I see our future as a party of government. Our party is not just a coalition partner of the past, we are the government of the future. And my role, as your leader, is to be a credible potential prime minister. At the Lib Dem conference Cable insists that the Lib Dem call for a second referendum isn\u2019t actually a call for a second referendum. This is not a call for a re-run. This is not a call for a second referendum on Brexit. This is a call for a first referendum on the facts. When we know what Brexit means, the people should get the choice. He says that, as a grandparent, he worries what impact will have. And he gets to the best joke of the speech so far. Now I recognise that the true believers in Brexit are honest enough to admit that it will make us poorer \u2026. \u2026 There is another word for that: masochism. It isn\u2019t illegal. I am told some people pay good money to indulge in it. But unlike masochists, the Brexit ideologues usually envisage someone else bearing the pain. And that pain will mainly be felt by young people who overwhelmingly voted to remain. Boris Johnson has been tweeting. But even an expert Johnsonologist would be hard pressed to infer much about his intentions from this. Back in Bournemouth Cable says it is \u201can outrage\u201d that President Trump has been invited to the UK on a state visit. And he turns to Labour. Today\u2019s Labour Party isn\u2019t into problem solving; let alone governing. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s acolytes are focused on how to maximise the contradictions of capitalism. You don\u2019t qualify for the Labour Shadow Cabinet these days unless you have studied the Venezuelan guide on how to bankrupt a rich economy. It\u2019s no wonder they backed Brexit. It\u2019s no wonder they lined up behind Theresa May, maximising the chances of chaos and disruption. Then a few weeks ago the moderates briefly penetrated the Corbyn bunker. They persuaded him that collaborating quite so closely with the class enemy didn\u2019t look too good. So, they\u2019ve got a new policy: which is to stay in the single market and customs union \u2026\u2026 possibly; or to leave \u2026\u2026 maybe. Or maybe to stay in for a bit, and then leave. I am being kind here: I am trying to understand what they are trying to say. I think the current line is \u2026 we should transition to the transition gradually while we prepare for a post transition world. Turning to Theresa May, he says she should take the issue of EU nationals out of the Brexit negotiations. Using them as a bargaining chips is \u201cnot only morally wrong but utterly counter-productive\u201d, he says. Ladbrokes say many people have been betting on Boris Johnson resigning. They are now offering odds of 11/4 on Johnson being sacked or resigning by Monday. Cable says, when the Lib Dems joined the coalition in 2010, they did so in the national interest. He pays tribute to Nick Clegg, sending his best wishes in the light of Clegg son\u2019s needing treatment for cancer and saying that \u201cjust as parliament now misses [Clegg\u2019s] voice, history will vindicate his judgement.\u201d He is now talking about Brexit, using the passages briefed overnight. See 11.25am. Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, is speaking now. He starts with a tribute to his predecessor, Tim Farron. He hands over a Party, which is larger, stronger and more diverse than the one he inherited. He stood up for refugees whose plight the government had shamefully ignored. He established our very clear identity as the only real, undiluted pro-European party. And Cable says only people who don\u2019t know the Lib Dems can say they are irrelevant. People who say they don\u2019t know what we stand for, or that we are irrelevant. Anyone who doubts the relevance of the Liberal Democrats should reflect on the three great disasters perpetrated by the two main parties in recent years: the war in Iraq; the banking crisis; now Brexit. Rachel Johnson, Boris\u2019s sister, is attending the Lib Dem conference. But she has no idea what her brother is up to either, the Sun\u2019s Matt Dathan reports. At the Lib Dem conference they have holding a fund raising appeal before Sir Vince Cable speaks. While in London Labour\u2019s national executive committee is passing the new Labour leadership rules, Channel 4 News\u2019s Michael Crick reports. The NEC has also been discussing plans to increase its size. LabourList\u2019s Emma Bean says there are fears this could hit the NEC\u2019s gender balance. Here is my colleague Owen Jones\u2019 take on Boris Johnson\u2019s antics. And this is how it starts. A Stephen King film set to the Benny Hill theme tune: that\u2019s Britain\u2019s current political plight. It feels like a horror show without end yet it is simultaneously preposterous and absurd. For the last two years, Britain has been held hostage by the Tories\u2019 disastrous scheming, plotting and manoeuvring: the EU referendum campaign, the chaotic aftermath, the snap general election. Boris Johnson \u2013 and goodness knows what we all did in a past life to deserve him \u2013 opportunistically backed Brexit as a career move. Despite his demonstrable buffoonery, he is astute enough to realise that Tory Brexit is spiralling into disaster. He risks going down in the history books as one of the principal architects of a national catastrophe. So now he plots and schemes, helping to plunge an already politically crippled Tory administration into further turmoil as Britain navigates through its postwar greatest crisis. The first ministers of Scotland and Wales have written to Theresa May calling on her to work with \u2013 not against \u2013 the devolved nations. As they published joint amendments to the UK government\u2019s EU withdrawal bill, Nicola Sturgeon and Carwyn Jones acknowledged their shared responsibility to work together across the United Kingdom to prepare for Brexit. But they said substantial amendments were needed before they could recommend the bill to the Scottish parliament and Welsh assembly In the letter to May the two leaders said: The Scottish and Welsh governments recognise our responsibility to prepare our laws for the upheaval of EU withdrawal. The governments of these islands have much work to do to ensure that stability and continuity can be achieved on exit day, and all governments will have to work together if that is to be done most effectively. So we stand ready to work in a cooperative and coordinated way with others to prepare for Brexit. But the approach of the UK government to devolution in the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill is preventing this essential cooperation and coordination.\u201d We want a European Union (Withdrawal) Bill that can be made to work with, not against, devolution. The current bill will need to be substantially amended for us to be able to recommend to our respective legislatures that they give their consent to it. My colleague Ian Prior is sceptical of the claim (see 1.59am) that the Telegraph\u2019s Boris Johnson resignation story was briefed by Johnson\u2019s enemies. Mike Russell, the Scottish government\u2019s Brexit minister, has said the UK ministers want to centralise EU powers over railway ownership, GM foods, pesticides regulation, sharing criminal data, protected food names, state aid, EU citizens voting rights and fracking. In a bid to substantiate the Scottish and Welsh governments\u2019 accusations of a Brexit \u201cpower grab\u201d by Westminster, Russell said these were on a list of 111 \u201cimportant policy areas\u201d currently controlled by the European Commission which directly affect Scotland\u2019s devolved powers. He published a summary of those powers as Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, and her Welsh counterpart Carwyn Jones, released a full set of amendments they say must be included in the UK government\u2019s EU withdrawal bill before their devolved parliaments will support the bill. Because the two governments\u2019 devolved powers are different, and devolution less advanced in Wales, the Welsh \u201cpower grab\u201d list will be shorter. However, both governments insist all EU powers over devolved competencies should first be repatriated directly to Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast. But in clause 11 of the EU withdrawal bill, the UK government states many new powers will devolved but only after they first return to Westminster. Russell is about to start talks with the Scottish Tories about striking a deal on the amendments and powers, so struck a conciliatory tone. But he said in a letter to MSPs at Holyrood: The restrictions in clause 11 of the bill apply to many areas of Scottish devolved responsibility vital to the success of our country, such as agriculture, the environment, fisheries, forestry, research, or justice co-operation. The restrictions have the effect that the Scottish parliament would have no say over what is done with these important policy areas after EU withdrawal. Russell acknowledges many EU powers will need to be shared at UK level in joint frameworks: Scotland\u2019s farmers, food industry leaders and businesses also want UK level laws over devolved competencies. The Scottish government is likely to give way on many topics in that list of 111 but will battle hard over others, such as fracking, GMOs, rail franchises, EU citizens voting \u2013 because that could affect voting rights in a future Scottish independence referendum, and economic investment. Boris Johnson was for many years a journalist and prize columnist at the Daily Telegraph, and so when it publishes a story about his private intentions on the resignation front (see 1.22pm), it is worth taking it seriously. But Johnson also has a close association with the Spectator, of which he used to be editor. And James Forsyth, the Spectator\u2019s political editor, is saying on Twitter that he is being told by Johnson\u2019s friends that the Telegraph story about Johnson possibly resigning this weekend is being spread by his enemies. Labour\u2019s most powerful governing body will be asked to agree to sweeping reforms when it meets this afternoon ahead of the party\u2019s conference, with the aim of handing significantly more power to the membership, my colleague Jessica Elgot reports. And this is what the Press Association has filed about Boris Johnson\u2019s comments. Boris Johnson has denied the cabinet is split over Brexit, insisting \u201cwe are a nest of singing birds\u201d. Johnson dismissed suggestions he might resign his post as foreign secretary over differences with Theresa May over the kings of Brexit deal the UK should strike. His comments come after days of speculation about rifts at the top of government sparked by his publication of his personal blueprint for Brexit. The foreign secretary spoke to TV cameras in New York after bumping into them at a hotel lift as he returned from a jog. Johnson is due to see the prime minister for the first time since his Telegraph article as the pair attend the United Nations general assembly. Asked if there was a cabinet split on Europe, Johnson said: \u201cNo, we are a government working together, we are a nest of singing birds.\u201d And asked directly if he would resign, he replied: \u201cNo.\u201d Johnson said: \u201cWe are working together, that is the key thing, to make sure that Britain can take advantage of the opportunities of Brexit.\u201d Boris Johnson has also been speaking publicly to reporters in New York. The message they have been getting is slightly different. These are from ITV\u2019s Robert Peston. And this is from Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby. Boris Johnson \u201cwill resign as foreign secretary before the weekend if Theresa May veers towards a \u201cSwiss-style\u201d arrangement with the EU in her Brexit speech in Florence\u201d, Gordon Rayner is reporting in the Telegraph (paywall). Rayner says the red line for Johnson would be May agreeing for the UK to make payments to the EU permanently in return for access to the single market. The Telegraph characterises this as a \u201cSwiss-style \u2018EEA minus\u2019 option\u201d. Switzerland is not in the EEA (European Economic Area), but it is in Efta (the European Free Trade Association). Rayner also says Johnson wants any transition period to end by December 2020 (ie, to last less than two years) and insists that the UK should only agree to pay money to the EU during the transition in return for an assurance that there will be a free trade agreement. In his speech to the Lib Dem conference Norman Lamb, the party\u2019s health spokesman, proposed cutting business rates for firms that take steps to improve the health of their workers. He told party members: Let\u2019s set a ten year plan to get employers really focused on the health and wellbeing of their workforce. As part of my work chairing a commission on mental health in the West Midlands, I\u2019ve proposed a \u2018wellbeing premium\u2019 - a temporary discount on your business rates if you take tangible steps to improve wellbeing at work. The evidence is there of what works. So let\u2019s do it. Neil McEvoy, a Plaid Cymru AM (assembly member), has been suspended from the Plaid group in the Welsh assembly, the BBC reports. It is partly because he criticised Plaid\u2019s decision to back a Welsh government move to stop \u201cright-to-buy\u201d, the policy allowing tenants to buy their council house. The number of zero-hours contracts has fallen by 300,000 over the past year, the Press Association reports. It says: A survey of businesses in May showed there were 1.4m contracts that did not guarantee a minimum number of hours, down from 1.7m, although the share of total contracts remained unchanged at 5%. The Office for National Statistics said people on zero-hours contracts were likely to be young, part time, female or in full-time education. Other data found that the number of workers employed on zero-hours contracts in their main job in the three months to June fell by 20,000 to 883,000 compared to the same period a year ago. Commenting on the figures, Frances O\u2019Grady, the TUC general secretary, said: While it\u2019s good that some employers have ditched them as a result of union campaigning, let\u2019s not pretend that life at the sharp end has become easier overnight. One in 10 UK workers remain in insecure jobs. The spread of low-paid self-employment, agency work and short-hours contracts mean millions are struggling to get by. The Government cannot afford to take its eye off the ball. We need more decent jobs in the parts of the country that need them most. And Daniel Tomlinson, policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said: Today\u2019s figures provide further evidence that the use of zero-hours contracts is declining in the UK. This decline fits with a wider move away from atypical work by many companies, as agency work and self-employment have also stopped growing, and almost all of the employment growth over the past 12 months is from increases in the number of full-time employees. A stronger labour market delivering better job security is good news, but levels of insecure work are still unacceptably high. The increase in full-time jobs has also yet to translate into higher pay. Average weekly earnings remain 16 a week below the pre-crisis peak in 2008, so there is still a way to go before we have a labour market that works for all workers. The Lib Dems released some extracts from Sir Vince Cable\u2019s conference speech overnight. My colleague Jessica Elgot wrote it up overnight. But are some more quotes. Cable will launch a withering attack on the government\u2019s handling of Brexit, saying decisions are being taken by people who \u201clive in a world of infantile fairy tales\u201d. A disaster looms. Brexit. The product of a fraudulent and frivolous campaign led by two groups of silly public school boys living their dormitory pillow fights. And now, thanks to Boris Johnson, they have degenerated into a full-scale school riot with the head teacher hiding, barricaded in her office. In the real world, we have yet to experience the full impact of leaving Europe. But we have a taste of what is to come in the fall of the value of the pound. Foreign exchange dealers are not point scoring politicians. Their cold, hard, unsentimental judgement has been, quite simply, that Brexit Britain will be poorer and weaker after Brexit than if we had decided to stay in Europe. Brexit was described by the Brexit secretary himself as an operation of such technical complexity that it makes the moon landing look simple. It is a pity that the Brexit landing is being managed by people who would struggle to get their heads around a toddlers\u2019 Lego set. They live in a world of infantile fairy tales. He will accuse Labour of not having a clear Brexit policy. So, they have a new policy: to stay in the Single market and Customs Union, possibly; or to leave, maybe. Or maybe to stay in for a bit, and then leave. I am trying to be kind here: I am trying to understand what they are trying to say. I think the current line is, we should transition to the transition gradually while we prepare for a post-transition world. This is what they mean by the smack of firm leadership on the biggest issue of the day. But if Jeremy Corbyn sits on the fence any longer, he is in danger of being sliced up the middle by the serrated edge. He would do better to get off the fence and refurbish his revolutionary credentials. Jeremy \u2013 join us in the Anti Brexit People\u2019s Liberation Front! He will say the Lib Dems want to work with \u201csensible grown-ups\u201d in other parties to minimise the impact of Brexit. What the people want. What the country now desperately needs is some political adults. That\u2019s you. That\u2019s us. Fortunately, we are not alone. There are sensible grown-ups in the Conservative party and the Labour party and the Greens. And beyond them are millions of people deeply worried about what is happening. We have to put aside tribal differences and work alongside like-minded people to keep the single market and customs union, essential for trade and jobs. He will renew his call for a referendum on the final Brexit deal. At the end of these tortuous divorce negotiations, the British public must be given a vote on the outcome. Let me be clear. This is not a call for a re-run \u2013 a second referendum \u2013 on Brexit. It is a call for a first referendum on the facts: when we know what Brexit means. We know that our call will, of course, be resented by the Brexit fundamentalists. We will be denounced as traitors and saboteurs. I\u2019m half prepared for a spell in a cell with supreme court judges, Gina Miller, Ken Clarke, and the governors of the BBC. But if the definition of sabotage is fighting to protect British jobs, public services, the environment and civil liberties, then I am a proud saboteur. The Lib Dem conference has been relatively low key. With just 12 MPs, the party would be struggling to make news even in a quiet political period. And the last few days have been anything but quiet ... But Lib Dem conference traditions endure. Last night they staged their regular Glee Club, devoted to singing satirical songs (often self-directed) and there was a new addition to the songbook, Guide Me, O Thou Great Theresa, sung to the tune of Cwm Rhondda. Here\u2019s an excerpt. Guide Me, O thou great Theresa Pilgrim through this Brexit land; I am weak, but thou are mighty, Hold me with thy powerful hand; Strong and stable, strong and stable, Strong and stable was the call: Strong and stable was the call ... But you\u2019ll tax my poorly granny, And take the children\u2019s lunch away; Don\u2019t show up for the debates What a shambles, your campaign Weak and wobbly, weak and wobbly You\u2019re not stable any more You\u2019re not stable any more. The Lib Dems are calling for Boris Johnson to be sacked. Referring to the IFS rebuttal in the Times (see 9.30am), Tom Brake, the Lib Dem Brexit spokesman, said: This analysis demolishes Boris Johnson\u2019s \u00a3350m lie. His position is completely at odds with the government\u2019s own official forecasts, which show Brexit will mean less money for public services like the NHS. Is Boris really proposing to strip farmers, scientists and UK regions of all their current funding? Theresa May must sack him now for contradicting the government and peddling blatant mistruths. With the cabinet\u2019s Brexit negotiations reaching a crunch point this week, here are some of the key Tory Brexit stories and articles from the papers and the web this morning. Tom Newton Dunn in the Sun says Boris Johnson \u201cbelieves Brexit negotiations will fail and end up with Theresa May being humiliated.\u201d The foreign secretary has told friends that it\u2019s vital the government prepares to walk away from the stalled talks as the EU will not give the UK any big concessions. Boris told one close friend recently that \u201cnobody ever beats the EU in a negotiation\u201d, and the Brussels elite will again succeed in grinding down the PM and force her to accept bad terms. The senior Tory\u2019s thinking explains why he is pushing Mrs May to keep to a hard line in talks and not give away big sums of money or agree to trade restrictions ... A close confidante of Boris\u2019s added: \u201cHe always makes a point of saying \u2018no deal is better than a bad deal\u2019 because he thinks it will be what we have to do. \u201cThey want to punish us, that has always been Boris\u2019s view, and that has now come abundantly clear from the negotiations so far.\u201d Jason Groves in the Daily Mail says Boris Johnson has floated the prospect of resigning from cabinet over Theresa May\u2019s Brexit strategy. Amid a deepening Cabinet row over strategy, the Foreign Secretary repeated his concerns about the dangers of being dragged into a long transitional deal. Friends said he was also concerned that Remainers in the Cabinet might wreck Brexit by keeping Britain in the single market in the long term ... Asked in New York he was planning to quit, the Foreign Secretary initially said: \u2018I think you may be barking up the wrong tree.\u2019 But he later added: \u2018When the burden of office is lifted from my shoulders I will of course look back with great pride on my time doing all sorts of things.\u2019 Mr Johnson\u2019s father Stanley also suggested his son was unhappy with the Government\u2019s position on Brexit ahead of a major speech by Mrs May. \u2018This is so important,\u2019 he said. \u2018I would have thought he would be happy, happy to walk away from the whole thing.\u2019 Downing Street has apparently put Mr Johnson on \u2018resignation watch\u2019 amid fears he may walk out. Francis Elliott and Sam Coates in the Times (paywall) say May has \u201csummoned ministers to a special cabinet meeting at which she will seek to bind Boris Johnson to her vision of Brexit on the eve of a key speech this week.\u201d It is reportedly scheduled for Thursday. A leading German economist, has told HuffPost UK that he hopes Britain and the EU will agree to a \u201cpermanent transition\u201d that would be equivalent to \u201cNorway plus\u201d. In an interview with HuffPost European editors, Clemens Fuest said that British GDP would be up to 4% lower in 2027 than it would have been if the UK had stayed in the European Union. Fuest, president of the highly-respected Ifo Institute for Economic Research, stressed that Brexit \u201cwill not be a catastrophe for the UK\u201d because lower growth will be offset by a devalued pound, boosting exports ... \u201cI hope for a status of permanent transition that could look like \u2018Norway plus\u2019 [with the UK outside the EU but in the single market]. That would be my preference: that state of transition would be forever,\u201d Fuest said. Rachel Sylvester in the Times (paywall) says Boris Johnson was \u201csimply taking advantage of a gaping hole in government policy\u201d when he published his Brexit article last week. In her speech in Florence on Friday, the prime minister is supposed to be unveiling her route map but even now, Whitehall sources say, the text is being rewritten and recalibrated as a weak and incompetent leader tries to balance the competing forces around her. Although she is said to be finally consulting colleagues, if it feels like anarchy it\u2019s because there is no agreement ... Crucially, and potentially catastrophically for the prime minister, the government\u2019s position on Brexit has still not been agreed by senior ministers. In fact, there has been no substantive cabinet discussion on our future relationship with the EU, nor any agreement around the top table about the trade-offs that should be made between access to the single market and immigration controls. That is not only astonishing but outrageous. As well as seeking to sideline parliament, Mrs May is also trying to bypass cabinet because she knows she is too weak to assert her authority over it. One ally of the prime minister says of Mr Johnson\u2019s intervention: \u201cTheresa would prefer ministers to air their differences in private.\u201d The reality is they haven\u2019t had a chance. The Sun in a leader article says Theresa May should back Boris Johnson. We must not sleepwalk into some Remoaner-friendly compromise, some pseudo-membership keeping us shackled to EU rules and court judgements. We need a separate EU free trade deal and complete freedom to make others worldwide, like the one Canadian PM Justin Trudeau talked up yesterday. We should walk out on anything less and take our chances. The EU has more to lose if talks collapse. In his Telegraph column (paywall) William Hague, like Ken Clarke (see 9.09am), said the UK should stay in the single market and the customs union during the Brexit transition. This is Labour party policy. Being diplomatic, Hague says Boris Johnson is right to be optimistic about Brexit. On what basis, then, can differences over the nature of Brexit \u2013 the transition, the bill, the immigration controls \u2013 be settled? I suggest the answer is what we might call \u201cupbeat realism\u201d: positive and enthusiastic about the future of the UK but realistic about the formidable difficulty of leaving the EU without damage. The instinct of Boris that the world needs to hear the upbeat message about Britain is correct, because far too many people abroad are now assuming that we are in some rather pitiable and paralysed state. But then Hague calls for a two-year transition, involving continued membership of the single market and the customs union, ongoing payments to the EU and the acceptance of free movement. This is where he and Johnson part company. Hague says: It is complete common sense that [businesses] need time to adapt and, as the CBI and others have pointed out, only one upheaval rather than two. Having a big change in customs, tariffs and regulations to enter a transition phase and then another one perhaps two years later is a nightmare if you are importing or exporting. The lesson of this is that it is very much worth going for a simple deal with the EU, with a couple of years when we stay in the single market and customs union and then have enough time to settle a good free trade deal. Doesn\u2019t that involve still paying into the EU? Yes, but doing so would partly end the argument over money. Wouldn\u2019t we be unable to restrict immigration in that time? True, but it turns out that net migration from EU countries has already fallen to about zero in recent months. In his Telegraph article Boris Johnson claimed that \u201cwe will take back control of roughly \u00a3350 million per week\u201d after Brexit and that it would be a \u201cfine thing\u201d if a lot of that money went to Brexit. The UK Statistics Authority said that this misleading and that Johnson was guilty of a \u201cclear misuse of official statistics\u201d. Johnson disputed this. I covered their dispute, and the arguments behind it, at length on the blog yesterday. (See here, here and here for example.) But, on matters of public finance, it is customary in Westminster/media circles to defer to the judgment of the Institute of Fiscal Studies. And the IFS has now pronounced, in a letter to the Times (paywall). It says that, far from Brexit saving the taxpayer \u00a3350m per week, the taxpayer is more likely to lose money from it overall, because of the impact Brexit will have on growth. It also points out that this is the official government position, because the government has accepted this analysis in the Office for Budget Responsibility forecast. Here is the letter, from the IFS\u2019s deputy director Carl Emmerson. The Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts the outlook for the UK economy and the public finances; these forecasts have been adopted by the chancellor as the government\u2019s own. They contain an allowance of almost \u00a3250m per week \u2014 not \u00a3350m \u2014 for funding that could in principle go to the NHS rather than the EU. But this would involve no state support for any other activities, such as subsidies for agriculture, that are at present funded in the UK by the EU. The bigger picture is that the forecast health of the public finances was downgraded by \u00a315bn per year \u2014 or almost \u00a3300m per week \u2014 as a direct result of the Brexit vote. Not only will we not regain control of \u00a3350m weekly as a result of Brexit, we are likely to make a net fiscal loss from it. Those are the numbers and forecasts which the government has adopted. It is perhaps surprising that members of the government are suggesting rather different figures. Here is a full summary of the best lines from Ken Clarke\u2019s interview on Today. Clarke, the Conservative former chancellor, said that Boris Johnson deserved to be sacked for his Brexit disloyalty. He said Johnson\u2019s Telegraph article on Brexit policy was an \u201cirrelevant nuisance\u201d and that the claim he made about Brexit making an extra \u00a3350m available for the NHS was \u201csimplistic and dishonest\u201d. If Johnson had concerns about policy, he should have raised them with Theresa May in private, Clarke said. He said that Johnson deserved to be sacked, but that May was too weak to do this. (See 8.33am.) When you\u2019re foreign secretary, you\u2019re a leading member of a government. The foreign policy you propound is the policy of the government, which you\u2019ve agreed with your colleagues. It\u2019s the only sensible, grownup way to run a government. Clarke said that urging people to be optimistic about Brexit, which was one of the main themes of Johnson\u2019s article, was \u201cnot a policy\u201d. All this \u2018if you jump of the cliff and spread out your arms, you\u2019ll find you\u2019re flying up to the broad blue yonder\u2019, that\u2019s not a policy. Clarke said he agreed with William Hague\u2019s argument (see 8.33am) that, if the Tories could not unite around a Brexit policy, Labour would end up in power. \u201cThat\u2019s obvious common sense,\u201d he said. And he said EU countries were also concerned about the lack of leadership coming from the government. And actually that is how we are perceived by our continental neighbours at the moment. Things have really stalled because we have lots of friends, inside the European Union and across the world, who cannot understand what we think we are doing. He particularly criticised Johnson for making his Brexit arguments in the Daily Telegraph, \u201cthe most Eurosceptic paper you can think of that is read by most of the people who\u2019ve got a vote in the leadership election.\u201d (But Johnson was a Telegraph journalist and then columnist for many years, making that an obvious place for him to place his article.) Clarke said the Brexit transition would have to be long. It will need a long transitional period to sort out the details. The idea that it will all be done overnight is just nonsense. This is one of the key areas of disagreement in the Conservative party. Yesterday Johnson said it was \u201cpretty important\u201d that the transition was \u201cnot too long\u201d. Clarke said the UK should stay in the EU single market and the customs union during the transition. This is Labour party policy. Government policy is to leave the single market and the customs union when the UK leaves the EU, although Philip Hammond, the chancellor, and David Davis, the Brexit secretary, have both said they want to preserve something very similar to single market and customs union membership during the transition. See here (Hammond) and here (Davis). Yesterday Theresa May sought to assert her authority over Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary who used a lengthy and surprise essay in the Daily Telegraph on Saturday to try to constrain her options on Brexit, by asserting that she was in charge. This morning Ken Clarke, the former chancellor and leading Conservative pro-European, was much more blunt. Describing Johnson\u2019s intervention as an \u201cirrelevant nuisance\u201d and \u201cdishonest\u201d, he said that Johnson would have been sacked for what he did, if it were not for the fact that May was in such a weak position. He told the Today programme: Personal publicity and campaigning by the foreign secretary is actually just an irrelevant nuisance. I think people have already said quite enough about somebody who is the foreign secretary just joining in a few days before and repeating one of the more simplistic and dishonest arguments of the hardline leavers during the referendum campaign ... They should tell him that if he wants to be foreign secretary, he should actually make some more serious contributions on wider foreign policy, give his views on the Brexit deal privately, as ministers have always been supposed to do, and remember that there [is] what is called collective responsibility. Sounding off personally in this way is totally unhelpful, and he should not exploit the fact that [Theresa May] has not got a majority in parliament and he knows perfectly well that, although normally a foreign secretary would be sacked for doing that, she unfortunately after the general election is not in a position to sack him. But he should stop exploiting it ... In any normal circumstances, he would have been sacked the day after. Clarke\u2019s intervention came after another Tory grandee, the former Tory leader and former foreign secretary William Hague, used his Telegraph column (paywall) to say that, if the party could not unite and agree a Brexit strategy, they would hand power to Labour. Hague said: More bluntly, it is now 15 months since the referendum, and high time that all members of the government were able to express themselves on this subject in the same way as each other, putting forward the same points, as part of an agreed plan. Hopefully, that happy circumstance will follow the speech the prime minister is due to give on the subject in Florence on Friday. If not, there will be no point Conservatives discussing who is going to be the foreign secretary, chancellor or prime minister in the coming years, because Jeremy Corbyn will be prime minister, sitting in Number 10 with John McDonnell and Diane Abbott, completely ruining this country. I\u2019m in Bournemouth today for the final day of the Lib Dem conference, where Sir Vince Cable will be delivering his first conference speech as leader. My colleague Jessica Elgot previewed it overnight. Cable is going to tell the Lib Dems that \u201cwhat the country desperately needs is some political adults\u201d taking charge of Brexit. It sounds like Clarke and Hague may be cheering him on ... Here is the agenda for the day. 9am: The Lib Dem conference opens. The morning includes debates on Euratom, small businesses, gun and knife crime and a speech from Norman Lamb, the health spokesman. Sir Vince Cable, the party leader, will wrap up the conference with a speech after 2pm. Theresa May is in New York, where she has meetings at the United Nations. And Labour\u2019s national executive committee is meeting, and expected to agree proposed new rules for the election of a party leader. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another after the Cable speech. You can read all today\u2019s Guardian politics stories here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news from Jack Blanchard\u2019s Playbook. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but normally I find it impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer direct questions, although sometimes I miss them or don\u2019t have time. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

          "bodyText": "Sir Vince Cable has said the Liberal Democrats will not succeed as a one-issue \u201creverse Ukip\u201d party, pledging that they will develop radical proposals for economic reforms including taxes on second homes and changes to tuition fees. The new Lib Dem leader attempted to put clear water between his leadership and the two years under his predecessor Tim Farron, declaring he wanted to re-establish the Lib Dems as a serious party of government, in his closing address to their autumn conference. The former business secretary, who won back his seat in parliament only three months ago, called for an \u201cend to the stranglehold of oligarchs and speculators\u201d in the property market. He said second homes must be disincentivised and the tax system needed radical reform to tax wealth rather than work. In the hall on Tuesday, where he walked in to the theme of Ski Sunday, his latest sporting hobby, Cable defended the record of the coalition government, which Farron distanced himself from during his tenure. However, Cable said the party still had \u201cto scrub ourselves hard to get rid of the smell of clearing up other people\u2019s mess\u201d. Senior party sources suggested that, although Cable backed the policy first proposed under Farron of a second referendum on Brexit, he wanted to lean heavily on his credibility as a former cabinet minister to give the party more gravitas. \u201cI want our party to lead the fight against Brexit.

          "body": "<p>Theresa May kept her gaze lowered. Fixed mainly on Justin Trudeau\u2019s shoes. It\u2019s not often the prime minister comes up against another world leader with better footwear. Besides, she didn\u2019t particularly want to catch anyone\u2019s eye as she didn\u2019t have much to say. Or rather she did, but not in front of the media.</p> \n<p>\u201cMerci, Justin,\u201d she said after the Canadian prime minister had kick-started their joint press conference by trying to wrack his brains for anything meaningful they had discussed over the last hour or so. They had chatted about how much they liked each other, what a deep and rich history their countries shared, how they hoped trade between Canada and the UK would continue after Brexit and how it was great that a couple of branches of Tesco had just opened in Montreal.</p> \n<p>The Maybot elaborated a little more. She was delighted that the trade agreement <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/30/eu-canada-sign-ceta-free-trade-deal-trudeau-juncker\">between Canada and the EU</a> had finally been negotiated after seven years and she very much hoped Britain and Canada could trade along the same lines after Brexit. With the words EU crossed out and UK inserted in their place. If you closed your eyes it would be just like nothing had happened. Trudeau was momentarily distracted by a flying pig. Realising she had made a compelling case for Britain remaining in the EU, she swiftly went off on a tangent to talk about the importance of the upcoming joint military exercise with the Canadians in Latvia.</p> \n<p>Understandably a few heads began to go down in the audience. They hadn\u2019t come to hear about Theresa\u2019s fantasy trade deals: they had come to talk about Boris. The BBC\u2019s John Pienaar was the first to mention the foreign secretary\u2019s less than helpful intervention at the weekend. Would she tolerate backseat driving on Brexit?</p> \n<p>\u201cThe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/18/theresa-may-attempts-to-reassert-authority-after-boris-johnson-brexit-claim\">UK government is driven from the front</a>, and we all have the same destination in our sights,\u201d the prime minister said, rather unconvincingly. She just didn\u2019t know who was actually sitting in the driving seat or what their shared destination was. With her circuits overloading, the prime minister lapsed into basic Maybot. She was focused on getting \u201cthe best possible deal with the EU\u201d and \u201clooking forward to future negotiations being conducted in a constructive manner\u201d. It was almost back to Brexit means Brexit.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"2e293ef3-8cb7-4397-a5dd-8fd339bd9e77\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div> \n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jwO8VEXfThc?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe> \n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Or Boris means Boris. Earlier in the day the Maybot had told reporters that \u201cBoris is Boris\u201d. A phrase not guaranteed to provide much reassurance. After all it\u2019s bad enough the whole country thinking the foreign secretary is an untrustworthy, narcissistic buffoon, without discovering that opinion is shared by the person who appointed him. And is too weak to sack him.</p> \n<p>The Maybot was no more expansive on trade deals post Brexit.

          "bodyText": "Theresa May kept her gaze lowered. Fixed mainly on Justin Trudeau\u2019s shoes. It\u2019s not often the prime minister comes up against another world leader with better footwear. Besides, she didn\u2019t particularly want to catch anyone\u2019s eye as she didn\u2019t have much to say. Or rather she did, but not in front of the media. \u201cMerci, Justin,\u201d she said after the Canadian prime minister had kick-started their joint press conference by trying to wrack his brains for anything meaningful they had discussed over the last hour or so. They had chatted about how much they liked each other, what a deep and rich history their countries shared, how they hoped trade between Canada and the UK would continue after Brexit and how it was great that a couple of branches of Tesco had just opened in Montreal. The Maybot elaborated a little more. She was delighted that the trade agreement between Canada and the EU had finally been negotiated after seven years and she very much hoped Britain and Canada could trade along the same lines after Brexit. With the words EU crossed out and UK inserted in their place. If you closed your eyes it would be just like nothing had happened. Trudeau was momentarily distracted by a flying pig. Realising she had made a compelling case for Britain remaining in the EU, she swiftly went off on a tangent to talk about the importance of the upcoming joint military exercise with the Canadians in Latvia. Understandably a few heads began to go down in the audience. They hadn\u2019t come to hear about Theresa\u2019s fantasy trade deals: they had come to talk about Boris. The BBC\u2019s John Pienaar was the first to mention the foreign secretary\u2019s less than helpful intervention at the weekend. Would she tolerate backseat driving on Brexit? \u201cThe UK government is driven from the front, and we all have the same destination in our sights,\u201d the prime minister said, rather unconvincingly. She just didn\u2019t know who was actually sitting in the driving seat or what their shared destination was. With her circuits overloading, the prime minister lapsed into basic Maybot. She was focused on getting \u201cthe best possible deal with the EU\u201d and \u201clooking forward to future negotiations being conducted in a constructive manner\u201d. It was almost back to Brexit means Brexit. Or Boris means Boris. Earlier in the day the Maybot had told reporters that \u201cBoris is Boris\u201d. A phrase not guaranteed to provide much reassurance. After all it\u2019s bad enough the whole country thinking the foreign secretary is an untrustworthy, narcissistic buffoon, without discovering that opinion is shared by the person who appointed him. And is too weak to sack him. The Maybot was no more expansive on trade deals post Brexit. Other than that we would be getting a very good one that was hers and hers alone. \u201cI don\u2019t recognise the simple binary approach,\u201d she added, failing to appreciate how her own language was coded. By the time she got on to why one of the chief negotiators had had to be moved from the Brexit department, she was in near meltdown. It wasn\u2019t a shambles, she insisted. Rather it was a sign of how well everything was going and that now negotiations were in a more intensive phase he had to be moved away from David Davis as the minister couldn\u2019t be trusted to get anything right. Over in New York, Boris was being interviewed by Sky News in his first public appearance since his weekend bombshell. He couldn\u2019t understand what all the fuss was about. Everyone had totally misread his intentions. Boris tugged at his hair and looked shifty throughout. A sure sign he was lying.

          "bodyText": "Theresa May\u2019s rift with Boris Johnson over Brexit has appeared to deepen, as she dismissed his claim that up to \u00a3350m a week could be freed up to spend on the NHS after Brexit; while the foreign secretary began musing openly about life outside government. Speaking to journalists on Monday on a flight to Canada, the prime minister sought to reassert her authority over the foreign secretary, saying: \u201cThis government is driven from the front, and we\u2019re all going to the same destination.\u201d May used a metaphor previously employed by home secretary Amber Rudd who had accused Johnson of \u201cbackseat driving\u201d, after he used a 4,000-word article in the Daily Telegraph to repeat the controversial claim that \u00a3350m a week could be spent on the NHS by leaving the European Union, and set out his personal vision for Brexit. The prime minister stopped short of condemning Johnson directly, saying only: \u201cBoris is Boris\u201d. But privately, No 10 was exasperated by Johnson\u2019s piece, which was not cleared in advance and came as May prepares to deliver a major speech on Brexit in Florence on Friday. It was widely read at Westminster as a challenge to the prime minister\u2019s authority. Johnson, who was in New York \u2013 where he will be joined by May for the UN general assembly on Tuesday, insisted he backed the prime minister\u2019s approach. \u201cAs far as backseat driving honestly there is only one driver in this car and it is Theresa,\u201d he said. But the foreign secretary also doubled down on his insistence that the UK must not pay for access to the single market after a transition period is over a few days before May is due to give a speech on Brexit policy on Friday \u2013 and even appeared to speculate about his own future. \u201cWe do not want to be paying extortionate sums for access to the single market,\u201d he said. \u201cThey would not pay us access to our market.\u201d The foreign secretary was rebuked by the statistics watchdog David Norgrove on Sunday, after reusing the \u00a3350m figure that was emblazoned on the side of Vote Leave\u2019s red battlebus during last year\u2019s referendum campaign. When asked by the BBC\u2019s James Landale if he would resign after the embarrassing spat, he said: \u201cI think you may be barking up the wrong tree.\u201d Johnson added: \u201cLet us not try and find rows where there are really not rows. \u201cWhen the burden of office is lifted from my shoulders I will of course look back with great pride on my time doing all sorts of things.\u201d Earlier, the prime minister rejected her foreign secretary\u2019s claim that up to \u00a3350m a week could be released to spend on other priorities after Brexit, and should be earmarked for the health service. When pressed on whether the NHS should be the top priority for any additional funds available after Brexit, she insisted: \u201cThat will be a decision that will be taken at the time, and will be taken by the government.\u201d However, Johnson appeared to be picking up support from fellow hardline Brexiters on Monday, while centrist Tories suspected a concerted bid to influence the prime minister ahead of her speech, due to be made in Florence.

And that is getting a good deal for Brexit with the European Union. That\u2019s a good trade deal, but also a good ongoing relationship in relation to other matters like security.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>May said that she thought the UK would be able to make a \u201cswift transition\u201d after Brexit to a new trade relationship with Canada based on Ceta, the EU-Canada free trade deal. Justin </strong><strong>Trudeau</strong>, the Canadian prime minister, also said he was \u201cvery confident\u201d that trade links between the two countries would remain strong. May said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We want to ensure that when we leave the European Union, for businesses and people, that change is as smooth and orderly as possible. </p> <p>And working on Ceta as becoming the first of the bilateral trade relationships between the UK and Canada that means that seamless transition can take place. People will know the basis on which that trading relationship will be set up. </p> <p>We will be having a working group, which obviously will be looking at the details of how that transition will operate in detail.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AndyWoodcock/status/909823384179048448\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JustinTrudeau\">@JustinTrudeau</a> says he is&quot;very confident&quot; of swift UK/Canada trade deal after <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Brexit?src=hash\">#Brexit</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/gmQNZ6dBub\">pic.twitter.com/gmQNZ6dBub</a></p>&mdash; Andrew Woodcock (@AndyWoodcock) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndyWoodcock/status/909823384179048448\">September 18, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <ul> <li><strong>May rejected claims that the government had to choose between a Ceta-style relationship with the EU after Brexit, or closer one.</strong> (This has been described by some commentators as a choice between EEA-minus and Ceta-plus - see<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/sep/18/boris-johnson-brexit-theresa-may-trudeau-conservatives-split-over-boris-johnsons-brexit-article-as-backlash-continues-politics-live?page=with:block-59bfdf10e4b08e19a9efc1cd#block-59bfdf10e4b08e19a9efc1cd\"> 5.09pm.) </a>When it was put to her that she had to choose between these two models, she replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I don\u2019t recognise the simple binary approach to the question of Brexit and the future relationship between the UK and the European Union post-Brexit. I\u2019ve always said that we\u2019re not looking to take a model off the shelf of a relationship that current exists because the UK is unique. We\u2019re already in the European Union and so we have a relationship with the EU already. When we come out we want to make sure we negotiate a good deal, a bespoke deal, a deal that is right for the United Kingdom.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>May insisted that the departure of Oliver Robbins, the government\u2019s lead official in the Brexit talks, from his post as permanent secretary at the department for leaving the EU (DExEU) was not a sign that the Whitehall structure she put in place for Brexit was shambolic.</strong> When this claim was put to her, she replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Not at all. What it is a sign of is that the negotiations are getting into a more detailed and more intense phase. As a result of that, I think it\u2019s right that Olly Robbins concentrates on that, and obviously a different structure will be put in place in terms of the running of the management of the department for exiting the European Union. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Trudeau said Canada would refuse to buy Boeing\u2019s Super Hornet jets unless Boeing dropped its legal case against the </strong><strong>Canadian aerospace firm Bombardier.</strong> Bombardier is a major employer in Northern Ireland and May said she would raise the matter again with President Trump when they met in New York. Trudeau went further. He said Canada was considering a major fighter jet procurement. He went on:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We have obviously been looking at the Super Hornet aircraft from Boeing as a potential significant procurement of our new fighter jets. But we won\u2019t do business with a company that is busy trying to sue us and put our aerospace workers out of business. </p> </blockquote> <p>That\u2019s all from me for today.</p> <p>Thanks for the comments.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-09-18T17:47:02.656Z\">at 6.47pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-59bffd07e4b0f6beafd39762\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-09-18T17:07:03.156Z\">6.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><em>Q: Doesn\u2019t the fact that Oliver Robbins has had to move show that the Brexit structure you put in place was a shambles?</em></p> <p>No, says May.

However, several of the most senior members of the Cabinet, backed by the institutional Treasury, think that Britain should stay as closely aligned to the single market as possible. They want Britain to shadow the EU\u2019s regulatory structures and transpose European Court of Justice judgements. This, they argue, would allow Britain to maintain the most frictionless access possible to the single market while getting out of free movement.</p> <p>But to the Brexiteers in the Cabinet this dilutes the whole point of leaving. They want Britain to have the freedom to chart a different course. Their aim is a deal with the EU based on the EU-Canada free trade agreement with a bit more on services. This would require Britain to obey some minimum labour and environmental standards. But it wouldn\u2019t require the entire UK economy to follow every piece of EU regulation. It would mean making trade with the EU less smooth than it is now as the price of Britain being able to be more globally competitive. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/comment/comment/tim-montgomerie-theresa-may-has-marginalised-boris-and-now-he-is-striking-back-a3637341.html\">Tim Montgomerie in the Evening Standard says Boris Johnson wrote his Telegraph article because he was fed up with Theresa May for refusing to recognise that people voted for Brexit because they wanted more money spent on the NHS.</a></strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In interview after interview, month after month, the Foreign Secretary has been taunted for Theresa May\u2019s failure even to aspire to honour the <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/topic/NHS\">NHS</a> pledge. Although one of her key Downing Street advisers, Stephen Parkinson (and, no accident, a member of the Leave campaign), attempted to persuade the PM to embrace the pledge in some tangible way, she has always been resistant. As we now know from her mishandling of the general election she has little understanding of how votes are won, and of the key role played by the NHS pledge in delivering the 52 per cent \u2014 or of the dangers of reneging on it.</p> <p>This is the backdrop to Johnson\u2019s 4,000-word article that appeared on Saturday. He\u2019s criticised for bad timing but would his intervention have been any more appreciated during May\u2019s honeymoon? Or during this year\u2019s election campaign? Or immediately afterwards during the PM\u2019s period of maximum vulnerability? Or in a fortnight, on the eve of the Conservative Party Conference, upstaging May\u2019s anticipated relaunch? Of course not.</p> <p>Johnson, excluded from all the big decisions on Brexit and constantly briefed against by May\u2019s very Blairite spin operation, has finally had enough. If he had not suffered that now infamous kamikaze attack from Michael Gove and won the Conservative leadership last summer he had intended to put honouring as much of the pledge as was humanly possible at the heart of the Brexit negotiations and of a new Conservatism. It wouldn\u2019t have been easy but it would have changed the game.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.conservativehome.com/platform/2017/09/henry-newman-johnson-has-got-the-foreign-office-back-in-brexit-business-and-for-that-we-should-all-be-grateful.html\"><strong>Henry Newman at ConservativeHome says the problem is that the cabinet has not decided what it wants.</strong></a></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019ve spoken to dozens of senior officials, ministers and advisers. None have disagreed with my fundamental concern: that the government has not yet decided what sort of country we ought to be after Brexit. There is a range of possibilities \u2013 from Norway\u2019s EEA/EFTA relationship to Switzerland\u2019s web of bilateral agreements and to a Canada-type Free Trade Agreement. Where should the UK land on this spectrum from Norway/Switzerland to Canada? Or, in the jargon preferred by Whitehall \u2013 do we go for a \u201chigh access, low control\u201d or \u201clow access, high control\u201d? Each scenario has benefits as well as disadvantages ...</p> <p>The government has taken too long to face up to the fundamental question before us. From speaking to civil servants, it seems that \u2013 at least until recently \u2013 the cabinet has not yet properly considered either a preferred end state or indeed transition policy. If the rumours are true that David Davis only saw the Lancaster House Speech and article 50 letter at the very last minute, it\u2019s no wonder that ministers like Johnson, who have been even further away from decision making, feel frustrated.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59bfec65e4b08e19a9efc218\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-09-18T16:00:20.586Z\">5.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are some more pictures from <strong>Theresa May</strong>\u2019s visit to Ottawa.</p> <p>She is due to hold a press conference with the Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau at about 5.30pm UK time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f3623b5331efdb73d2a8c14727ef3944b2cd022e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3623b5331efdb73d2a8c14727ef3944b2cd022e/0_157_2875_1725/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Theresa May stands with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau during a ceremony in Ottawa.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Theresa May stands with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau during a ceremony in Ottawa.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Kilpatrick/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a22dafbc740f9f0f871bd12a9fa965af4ad48d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a22dafbc740f9f0f871bd12a9fa965af4ad48d1/0_158_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"May inspects the honour guard.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">May inspects the honour guard.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Wattie/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eec49af2042e83f09b799a5addea5bf824d6e18d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eec49af2042e83f09b799a5addea5bf824d6e18d/99_8_4572_3418/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Speaker of the House of Commons Geoff Regan (left) and Speaker of the Senate George Furey (right) stand as Theresa May signs a visitors book after arriving on Parliament Hill in Ottawa.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"748\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Speaker of the House of Commons Geoff Regan (left) and Speaker of the Senate George Furey (right) stand as Theresa May signs a visitors book after arriving on Parliament Hill in Ottawa.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Canadian Press/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"585cd9a12da5cc4285e142c5cddd53f6b188a08d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/585cd9a12da5cc4285e142c5cddd53f6b188a08d/0_69_2960_1776/1000.jpg\" alt=\"May talking with Trudeau.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">May talking with Trudeau.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59bfe901e4b0697be58adad0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-09-18T15:53:42.002Z\">4.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>If anyone is still confused about how much the UK contributes to the EU budget, they should consult the letter that the UK Statistics Authority sent to the Lib Dem MP Norman Lamb about this in April last year, in response to a question about the accuracy of the claim on the Vote Leave bus.

Here\u2019s an extract.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Prior to the election, there were \u201csignificant numbers of written advice items which went straight from Olly to the prime minister and weren\u2019t necessarily seen by David Davis beforehand,\u201d the ex-official said, adding that Davis was even frozen out of the early drafting of May\u2019s pivotal Lancaster House speech in January, in which the prime minister laid out her vision for Brexit.</p> <p>One senior official said problems remain. \u201cOlly does things which DD isn\u2019t aware of,\u201d the official said. \u201cThat Robbins-May dynamic is a constant source of frustration for David Davis.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Then the election result changed the dynamic of the relationship, Cooper says.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cOn the morning of 9th June, the day after the election, DD was in there being an adviser, trying to stake his position,\u201d the ex-official said. \u201cHe tried to place himself very firmly in the inner circle in the immediate post-election aftermath.

Instead his move is just an acknowledgement of the fact that, with the Brexit negotiations about to intensify, \u201cthe workload of running a department would be better handled by someone else\u201d, one source said. The source said that Robbins could continue to be the lead official in the Brexit negotiating team and that, when David Davis, the Brexit secretary, appeared in Brussels to negotiate with his EU opposite number, Michel Barnier, Davis would continue to appear flanked by Robbins and Sir Tim Barrow, the UK\u2019s ambassador to the EU.</p> <p>Two weeks ago Politico Europe published<a href=\"http://www.politico.eu/article/britains-other-brexit-battle-david-davis-olly-robbins-feud/\"> a long report claiming that relations between Robbins and Davis were strained</a>. Sources are downplaying this, and insisting that it is not a relevant factor in this move, although putting Robbins in the Cabinet Office will result in him having less contact with Davis on a day to day basis.</p> <p>An alternative interpretation would be that this amounts to May taking a firmer grip over the Brexit talks. May has a good relationship with Robbins. According <a href=\"http://www.politico.eu/article/britains-other-brexit-battle-david-davis-olly-robbins-feud/\">to the Politico Europe article:</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Robbins has a longstanding relationship with May, having served with her at the Home Office. They are \u201cunbelievably close,\u201d a former colleague of them both said. An ex-official added: \u201cShe clearly trusts him, more so than some of the other senior Europe advisers, and other permanent secretaries.

After all, the UK Statistics Authority is an internationally respected body chaired by an esteemed economist. Boris Johnson is also renowned, but he is not revered for his commitment to accuracy. In fact, as a Europe correspondent before he became an MP, he was notorious for his unreliability. At his Brussels leaving do a colleague recited a spoof of Belloc\u2019s Matilda starting: \u201cBoris told such dreadful lies/ It made one gasp and stretch one\u2019s eyes./ His desk, which from its earliest youth/ Had kept a strict regard for truth,/ Attempted to believe each scoop/ Until they landed in the soup.\u201d</p> <p>So why is Downing Street refusing to take sides? Perhaps it is just because Theresa May is airborne, en route to Canada, and the press office does not want to pre-empt what she says when asked about this herself, either by journalists on the plane or at the press conference later.</p> <p>However, there is a good chance that, even when May does address this in person, she will refuse to take sides. She could not disown the UK Statistics Authority without severely undermine its reputation (and, in the eyes of many observers, probably her own too). But if she were to publicly back the government\u2019s statistics watchdog, she would be implicitly accusing Johnson of misrepresentation. It is the sort of thing that could provoke him to resign. Even before Johnson\u2019s article appeared in the Telegraph there were reports saying Downing Street was worried about him flouncing out of government before the Tory conference. May will not want to give him a pretext.</p> <p>This is from the Times\u2019 <strong>Francis Elliott </strong>from last week.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/elliotttimes/status/908305860123906048\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Downing Street puts Boris on &quot;flounce-watch&quot;<a href=\"https://t.co/tHZSpfJQBR\">https://t.co/tHZSpfJQBR</a></p>&mdash; Francis Elliott (@elliotttimes) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elliotttimes/status/908305860123906048\">September 14, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-09-18T11:54:06.628Z\">at 12.54pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-59bfa0d2e4b06eeee7d81b41\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-09-18T10:36:53.174Z\">11.36am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">No 10 refuses to take sides in row between Johnson and statistics chief over \u00a3350m claim</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>My colleague <strong>Peter Walker</strong> is just back from the Number 10 lobby briefing.

Taxation is routinely referred to as gross: the lower-paid half of the country gets all of its money back (and <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/incomeandwealth/bulletins/theeffectsoftaxesandbenefitsonhouseholdincome/financialyearending2015\">more</a>) in public services. But people still talk about the sum that\u2019s taken from them, and understandably so. Those who advocate lower taxes emphasise \u2013 as Boris does \u2013 control. That people spend their own money better on themselves than the government does on their behalf. So the gross figure is, obviously, the most relevant.</p> <p>Doubtless Sir David doesn\u2019t like this argument, but in trying to say that it\u2019s illegitimate \u2013 or somehow an \u201cclear misuse\u201d of statistics \u2013 he is over-reaching and calling the neutrality of his office into doubt. During the campaign, Sir David\u2019s more measured predecessor Andrew Dilnot was called in to adjudicate in the \u00a3350 million figure being used in genuinely dodgy way (ie, leading people to suspect that this was the net payment that could be recouped after Brexit). Dilnot rightly said that this was \u2018potentially misleading\u2019 \u2013 ie, if used the wrong context.

He told the programme:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think it\u2019s much better not to have a transition period. Indeed, I think the remaining 19 months [before Brexit] could be a transition period of there are things we need to change in order to comply with the new agreement. What we need to do now is concentrate on the [future UK-EU] agreement, not on some kind of transition agreement. We need to know if we are going to be transiting to something we want to do, or whether there isn\u2019t an agreement on offer, so we won\u2019t be transiting to that at all. </p> </blockquote> <p>He also said the UK should not continue paying money to the EU after Brexit for access to the single market. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Many of us don\u2019t think there is any moral or political or legal reason to go on paying them once we have left. Indeed, I think it would be illegal to go on paying them once we have left. And I find it very odd how many people there are around government, in official circles and advising government, who seem to think the British people want to pay a lot of money to the EU after we have resigned from the club. They don\u2019t, I can assure you ...</p> <p>When it comes to trade, it is a very odd idea that you need to pay to import BMWs or whatever and make a payment to the EU. </p> </blockquote> <p>Redwood\u2019s position puts him clearly at odds with the government in two respects.</p> <p>First, even the pro-Brexit cabinet minsters now accept that a transition period will be necessary.</p> <p>Second, it is accepted in government that a Brexit deal will involve some payments to the EU after Brexit. It seems likely that, in practice, these could be implicitly connected to single market access. But whether there will be a formal link is another matter, because the EU is demanding money as the UK\u2019s share of outstanding EU budget obligations and these payments would not formally be linked to single market access.</p> <p>In perhaps the most important line in<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/09/15/boris-johnson-vision-bold-thriving-britain-enabled-brexit/\"> his Telegraph article (paywall),</a> <strong>Boris Johnson</strong> said an explicit link between payments to the EU and single market access would be unacceptable.

It would be a fine thing, as many of us have pointed out, if a lot of that money went on the NHS.\u201d</p> <p>That is very different from claiming that there would be an extra \u00a3350m available for public spending and I am amazed that you should impute such a statement to me. </p> <p>You claim in your defence that we would not really be taking back control of that sum, because it includes the rebate and other EU spending in this country. But, as you accept, these sums - amounting to about half the \u00a3350m - are spent at the discretion of the EU. We do not control them. </p> <p>To give you an example: when I was mayor of London I thought it would be a good idea if we persuaded the commission to spend \u00a38m on the Emirates cable car. We succeeded, and the commissioner concerned was so delighted with the results that he said he would like to fund some more cable cars in London. I was delighted, too, and was glad to have steered some of our EU contributions back to this country. But the decision was his. Control was in the hands of the commission, not the UK. Or do you suggest otherwise ? </p> <p>As for the balance of the \u00a3350m, it of course disappears around the rest of the EU, and is spent as the EU sees fit in other countries. Once we leave the EU we will take back control of all such UK-funded spending, and, although of course I have no doubt that we will continue to spend significantly on UK priorities such as agriculture and research, that spending will be done under UK control. </p> <p>As for the rebate - whose value you did not know - it only forms part of the EU\u2019s financing arrangements with the agreement of all other EU member states. We do not control it ourselves. </p> <p>What is beyond doubt is that, upon withdrawal, we will have complete discretion over the \u00a3350m per week and that huge sums will indeed will be available for public spending on priorities such as the NHS. I believe that would be a fine thing. </p> <p>If you had any concerns about my article, it would of course have been open to you to address the points with me in private rather than in this way in a public letter. As it is, if you seriously disagree with any of the above, I look forward to hearing your reasoning. </p> <p>Boris Johnson </p> <p>Secretary of State for Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Affairs</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1314ee61af0034bf6e442ac4d9a5199d12296af3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1314ee61af0034bf6e442ac4d9a5199d12296af3/0_40_1440_864/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sir David Norgrove.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sir David Norgrove.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Brady/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59bf772de4b06eeee7d81a96\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-09-18T08:11:00.315Z\">9.11am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Good morning. It is more than 48 hours since Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, published his long, provocative Brexit essay in the Daily Telegraph but his intervention is still dominating the talk at Westminster and dividing Conservative.</p> <p>Here are two Tories who have spoken out against him overnight.</p> <p><strong>George Freeman</strong>, who chairs the Conservative party\u2019s policy forum and the prime minister\u2019s policy board, told the Westminster Hour last night that he thought Johnson was wrong to suggest that Brexit would lead to the UK government being able to spend an extra \u00a3350m a week and that a lot of the money should go to the NHS. Freeman said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Personally I think the \u00a3350 million figure is just far too early to be able to make wild promises about what exactly is going to be coming out of the Brexit negotiations ... It\u2019s not a figure I would have repeated, and he\u2019s not the health secretary and it needs to be negotiated.</p> </blockquote> <p>And <strong>Tobias Ellwood</strong>, who was a minister in the Foreign Office under Johnson until June, used Twitter to accuse his former boss of fomenting disunity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Tobias_Ellwood/status/909539025467342848\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">PARTY DISCORD:<br>Think many would agree:<br>We are not witnessing our finest hour-at a testing time when poise, purpose and unity are called for <a href=\"https://t.co/09IWYLG3my\">pic.twitter.com/09IWYLG3my</a></p>&mdash; Tobias Ellwood (@Tobias_Ellwood) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Tobias_Ellwood/status/909539025467342848\">September 17, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>But in an article<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/09/17/boris-johnson-has-revived-romantic-vision-brexit-desperately/\"> in the Daily Telegraph (paywall),</a><strong> Jacob Rees-Mogg</strong>, the pro-Brexit backbencher, says Johnson has made Theresa May \u201cstronger\u201d because he has set out a positive vision for Brexit.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Needless to say, Boris\u2019 critics, a small but noisy group, see this as a leadership bid, but in truth it helps the Government and boosts Mrs May. As the foreign secretary he is quite reasonably setting out an enthusiastic case for Britain\u2019s future position in the world. That is what he ought to do; it is part of his job. He is loyally putting forward Government policy <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/17/theresa-mays-brexit-speech-full/\">as outlined by the Prime Minister in her Lancaster House speech</a>, and is doing so with panache to explain why this approach will benefit the nation.

          "bodyText": "Here are the main points from the press conference. Theresa May has insisted that her government is united over Brexit. Referring to Amber Rudd\u2019s comment yesterday about Boris Johnson behaving like a backseat driver, May said: The UK government is driven from the front, and we all have the same destination in our sights. And that is getting a good deal for Brexit with the European Union. That\u2019s a good trade deal, but also a good ongoing relationship in relation to other matters like security. May said that she thought the UK would be able to make a \u201cswift transition\u201d after Brexit to a new trade relationship with Canada based on Ceta, the EU-Canada free trade deal. Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, also said he was \u201cvery confident\u201d that trade links between the two countries would remain strong. May said: We want to ensure that when we leave the European Union, for businesses and people, that change is as smooth and orderly as possible. And working on Ceta as becoming the first of the bilateral trade relationships between the UK and Canada that means that seamless transition can take place. People will know the basis on which that trading relationship will be set up. We will be having a working group, which obviously will be looking at the details of how that transition will operate in detail. May rejected claims that the government had to choose between a Ceta-style relationship with the EU after Brexit, or closer one. (This has been described by some commentators as a choice between EEA-minus and Ceta-plus - see 5.09pm.) When it was put to her that she had to choose between these two models, she replied: I don\u2019t recognise the simple binary approach to the question of Brexit and the future relationship between the UK and the European Union post-Brexit. I\u2019ve always said that we\u2019re not looking to take a model off the shelf of a relationship that current exists because the UK is unique. We\u2019re already in the European Union and so we have a relationship with the EU already. When we come out we want to make sure we negotiate a good deal, a bespoke deal, a deal that is right for the United Kingdom. May insisted that the departure of Oliver Robbins, the government\u2019s lead official in the Brexit talks, from his post as permanent secretary at the department for leaving the EU (DExEU) was not a sign that the Whitehall structure she put in place for Brexit was shambolic. When this claim was put to her, she replied: Not at all. What it is a sign of is that the negotiations are getting into a more detailed and more intense phase. As a result of that, I think it\u2019s right that Olly Robbins concentrates on that, and obviously a different structure will be put in place in terms of the running of the management of the department for exiting the European Union. Trudeau said Canada would refuse to buy Boeing\u2019s Super Hornet jets unless Boeing dropped its legal case against the Canadian aerospace firm Bombardier. Bombardier is a major employer in Northern Ireland and May said she would raise the matter again with President Trump when they met in New York. Trudeau went further. He said Canada was considering a major fighter jet procurement. He went on: We have obviously been looking at the Super Hornet aircraft from Boeing as a potential significant procurement of our new fighter jets. But we won\u2019t do business with a company that is busy trying to sue us and put our aerospace workers out of business. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Q: Doesn\u2019t the fact that Oliver Robbins has had to move show that the Brexit structure you put in place was a shambles? No, says May. She says it shows that the negotiations are moving to a different phase. And that is it. The press conference is over. I will post a summary soon. Q: Did you discuss using Britain and Canada\u2019s economic model to put pressure on Boeing, by cancelling contracts? Trudeau says Canada is embarking on a procurement process. That includes replacing fighter jets. Canada has been looking at the Boeing Super Hornet. But Canada won\u2019t do business with a company trying to put Canada out of business, he says. Q: [To May] Do you fancy a Ceta-style relationship with the EU after Brexit, or something closer? [See 5.09pm for more on the background to this.] May says she does not recognise that simple binary choice. She has always said she does not want to take a model off the shelf. The UK is in a unique position, she says. She wants to negotiate a good, bespoke deal for the UK. That will be in the interests of the EU as well. Q: Will you speak to President Trump about Bombadier? (See 1.46pm.) May says she has already spoken to Trump about this. She will speak to him about it in New York. She wants a resolution to this, to defend jobs in Northern Ireland. Trudeau says defending the CSeries aircraft is a priority for his government. He will be working with May and explaining to the Americans how Boeing\u2019s actions are harmful. He says the action Boeing is taking is in their \u201cnarrow economic interests\u201d. It is not in the interests of trade, he says. He says he will continue to stand up strongly in defence of Canadian jobs. Q: Won\u2019t negotiating a trade deal with Canada ruffle feathers with the EU? May says it makes sense to maintain the Ceta arrangements throughout the transition. The UK has discussed this with the EU, she says. Trudeau says Ceta will make an \u201cexcellent basis\u201d for ensuring a smooth transition. After that there will be a chance to see whether the UK-Canada trade relationship can be improved. Q: Will you tolerate backseat driving on Brexit? May says the UK government is driven from the front. They all have the same destination in their sights. She says she wants a deep and special partnership with the EU. Q: Will we see a Brexit plan for Britain that is clearer by the end of the week? May says she set out her plan for Brexit in the Lancaster House speech. She says she will speak on Friday. The negotiations are being conducted in a positive spirit. Q: Ceta took seven years to negotiate. How long will a UK-Canada deal take place? May says the UK starts in a different place. Trudeau says he expects to have a strong relationship with the UK throughout the transition. Q: What do you want to hear from Aung San Suu Kyi at the UN tomorrow? Trudeau says Canada is very concerned about the plight of the Rohingya. There is a need to de-esclate the situation. May says she echoes what Trudea said. It important the situation is de-escalated. In response to a question, Trudeau says Canada will respect the EU rules about negotiating a trade deal. But he expects Canada and the UK to be able to move swiftly to a new trade deal. May says they hope the two countries can move smoothly to a new trade relationship. Trudeau says implementing Ceta (the EU-Canada deal) will eliminate more than 90% of trade barriers between them. He says it is reasonable to take Ceta as the model after Brexit. May is still speaking. She says Britain and Ukraine will take part in joint military exercises in Ukraine. They are both promoting Nato reform, she says. And they are working together on counter-terrorism. She thanks Canada for the support offered after the Manchester and London terror attacks. Theresa May opens in French, thanking \u201cJustin\u201d for welcoming her. She quickly reverts to English, and starts by talking about the close relationship between Canada and the UK. She says she and Trudeau spoke about ending the gender pay gap, and about initiatives to tackle domestic violence. They are both committed to moving away from a reliance on coal as an energy source. The UK and Canada are natural partners in promoting free trade, she says. She says Ceta, the EU-Canada free trade deal, is coming into force this week. She says she and Trudeau have agreed to a \u201cswift transition\u201d from that to a UK-Canada deal after Brexit. May says there will be a \u201cswift transition\u201d from EU-Canada trade deal to a UK-Canada one after Brexit. Trudeau is opening the press conference, rattling through some of the administrative proposals he and Theresa May have agreed. Theresa May and Justin Trudeau are holding their press conference now. Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, has been speaking in New York ahead of the UN General Assembly. Referring to his Telegraph article, he said: As far as backseat driving honesty there is only one driver in this car and it is Theresa. What I am trying to do is sketch out is the incredibly exciting landscape of the destination ahead. On paying for access to the single market he said: We do not want to be paying extortionate sums for access to the single market. They would not pay us access to our market. What we will do, and everyone understand this, so far as we are on the hook for stuff in the short term that we have agreed to, that is fair enough. I have never objected to that. On the length of the transition period he said: It is pretty important that it should not be too long and business should have a clear sense about where we are going and what it is like at the end of it. I am trying to to say once you take back control there are opportunities. Asked if he would resign: I think you may be barking up the wrong tree. On the transition period I can see some vital importance of having some clarity and certainty since what all of us want is that it should not be too long. Let us not try and find rows where there are really not rows. I perfectly understand that we have to honour legal obligations. What I am trying to do is in advance of the prime minster\u2019s speech ... People want to know where are going. It is good to have a bit of a opening drum roll about what this country can do. Boris Johnson has denied being a backseat driver in the cabinet on the issue of Brexit, my colleague Patrick Wintour reports. Amber Rudd, the home secretary, described him as a backseat driver on this in an interview yesterday. Peter Ricketts, a former head of the Foreign Office, says moving Oliver Robbins to the Cabinet Office is \u201csensible\u201d. The Royal Statistical Society has joined those criticising Boris Johnson for his use of the \u00a3350m figure, BuzzFeed\u2019s Emily Asthton reports. Here are three of the most illuminating articles on Boris Johnson and the government\u2019s Brexit position I\u2019ve read today. James Forsyth at Coffee House says the key split in the cabinet now is over \u201cwhether Britain should be aiming for an EEA minus deal with the EU or a CETA plus one.\u201d Free movement makes it a political non-starter for Britain to stay in the single market. However, several of the most senior members of the Cabinet, backed by the institutional Treasury, think that Britain should stay as closely aligned to the single market as possible. They want Britain to shadow the EU\u2019s regulatory structures and transpose European Court of Justice judgements. This, they argue, would allow Britain to maintain the most frictionless access possible to the single market while getting out of free movement. But to the Brexiteers in the Cabinet this dilutes the whole point of leaving. They want Britain to have the freedom to chart a different course. Their aim is a deal with the EU based on the EU-Canada free trade agreement with a bit more on services. This would require Britain to obey some minimum labour and environmental standards. But it wouldn\u2019t require the entire UK economy to follow every piece of EU regulation. It would mean making trade with the EU less smooth than it is now as the price of Britain being able to be more globally competitive. Tim Montgomerie in the Evening Standard says Boris Johnson wrote his Telegraph article because he was fed up with Theresa May for refusing to recognise that people voted for Brexit because they wanted more money spent on the NHS. In interview after interview, month after month, the Foreign Secretary has been taunted for Theresa May\u2019s failure even to aspire to honour the NHS pledge. Although one of her key Downing Street advisers, Stephen Parkinson (and, no accident, a member of the Leave campaign), attempted to persuade the PM to embrace the pledge in some tangible way, she has always been resistant. As we now know from her mishandling of the general election she has little understanding of how votes are won, and of the key role played by the NHS pledge in delivering the 52 per cent \u2014 or of the dangers of reneging on it. This is the backdrop to Johnson\u2019s 4,000-word article that appeared on Saturday. He\u2019s criticised for bad timing but would his intervention have been any more appreciated during May\u2019s honeymoon? Or during this year\u2019s election campaign? Or immediately afterwards during the PM\u2019s period of maximum vulnerability? Or in a fortnight, on the eve of the Conservative Party Conference, upstaging May\u2019s anticipated relaunch? Of course not. Johnson, excluded from all the big decisions on Brexit and constantly briefed against by May\u2019s very Blairite spin operation, has finally had enough. If he had not suffered that now infamous kamikaze attack from Michael Gove and won the Conservative leadership last summer he had intended to put honouring as much of the pledge as was humanly possible at the heart of the Brexit negotiations and of a new Conservatism. It wouldn\u2019t have been easy but it would have changed the game. Henry Newman at ConservativeHome says the problem is that the cabinet has not decided what it wants. I\u2019ve spoken to dozens of senior officials, ministers and advisers. None have disagreed with my fundamental concern: that the government has not yet decided what sort of country we ought to be after Brexit. There is a range of possibilities \u2013 from Norway\u2019s EEA/EFTA relationship to Switzerland\u2019s web of bilateral agreements and to a Canada-type Free Trade Agreement. Where should the UK land on this spectrum from Norway/Switzerland to Canada? Or, in the jargon preferred by Whitehall \u2013 do we go for a \u201chigh access, low control\u201d or \u201clow access, high control\u201d? Each scenario has benefits as well as disadvantages ... The government has taken too long to face up to the fundamental question before us. From speaking to civil servants, it seems that \u2013 at least until recently \u2013 the cabinet has not yet properly considered either a preferred end state or indeed transition policy. If the rumours are true that David Davis only saw the Lancaster House Speech and article 50 letter at the very last minute, it\u2019s no wonder that ministers like Johnson, who have been even further away from decision making, feel frustrated. Here are some more pictures from Theresa May\u2019s visit to Ottawa. She is due to hold a press conference with the Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau at about 5.30pm UK time. If anyone is still confused about how much the UK contributes to the EU budget, they should consult the letter that the UK Statistics Authority sent to the Lib Dem MP Norman Lamb about this in April last year, in response to a question about the accuracy of the claim on the Vote Leave bus. The annex, a note by the deputy national statistician for economic statistics, Jonathan Athow, is especially helpful. You can read them both here (pdf). Here is the key table. It shows that in 2014 the average gross weekly contribution would have been been \u00a3365m if there had not been a rebate. Allowing for the rebate, the average gross weekly contribution was \u00a3285m. Taking into account the money paid back to public sector bodies (including money subsequently passed on to the private sector, like agricultural subsidies and regional developments funds), the net weekly contribution was \u00a3190m. As the note explains, the net weekly contribution is even lower if you take into account the money paid by the EU to non-public bodies too. Willie Rennie, the Scottish Lib Dem leader, told the Lib Dem conference that the SNP wold lose the next Scottish election. He said: By the SNPs\u2019 very own test they are failing. They are spending more time obsessing about power and control than delivering on health, on crime and on education. People are fed up waiting for the SNP to deliver on their promises. And they will tell them - loud and clear - your time is up. Theresa May has arrived at the Canadian parliament in Ottawa. These are from some of the British journalists travelling with her. Earlier today the Brexit department published its \u201cpartnership paper\u201d on security and law enforcement after Brexit. Yvette Cooper, the Labour chair of the Commons home affairs committee, says it leaves crucial questions about the European court of justice unresolved. In a statement she said: Whilst it is very welcome that the government has now committed to continuing the UK\u2019s close security cooperation with the EU, this position paper still doesn\u2019t answer the crucial question about the European court of justice. If the government is sticking to the prime minister\u2019s \u2018red line\u2019 on removing the judicial oversight of the ECJ, where are the proposals for an alternative model of dispute resolution? What is the likelihood of getting agreement on and then establishing a new model from scratch by March 2019? And what will ministers do if that fails? As the paper makes clear it would be really dangerous to end up with operational gaps in law enforcement and justice because these issues remain unresolved. And Sir Ed Davey, the Lib Dem home affairs spokesman, made a similar point. He said: This government has finally woken up to the fact that security cooperation with our European partners is vital. We should welcome this as a starting point. But instead of accepting a role for the ECJ, the paper repeats Theresa May\u2019s ridiculous red line. This level of delusion would be laughable if it wasn\u2019t so concerning. The Conservatives have once again shown they\u2019re prepared to put ideological obsessions above the safety and best interests of our country. Turning back to Oliver Robbins\u2019 move, the FT\u2019s legal commentator David Allen Green says the mistake was setting up DExEU, the department for leaving the EU, in the first place. Boris Johnson has met President Trump at the UN in New York. Theresa May has insisted her government is being \u201cdriven from the front\u201d as she distanced herself from Boris Johnson\u2019s renewed claim that up to \u00a3350m a week extra should be made available for the NHS after Brexit. The foreign secretary was accused of \u201cback seat driving\u201d by his cabinet colleague Amber Rudd on Sunday, after he used a 4,000 word article in the Daily Telegraph to repeat the controversial \u00a3350m figure, and set out his personal vision of Brexit. Speaking to journalists on Monday en route to Canada, May sought to reassert her authority, saying: \u201cThis government is driven from the front, and we\u2019re all going to the same destination\u201d. But she stopped short of condemning Johnson directly, saying only: \u201cBoris is Boris.\u201d She said: We are all agreed as a government about the importance that we get the right deal for Brexit; the right withdrawal arrangements but also the right deep and special partnership between the United Kingdom and the European Union in the future. And we\u2019re all optimistic about what we can be achieving as the United Kingdom in the future. Asked directly about the foreign secretary\u2019s intervention, she said: Look, Boris is Boris. I am clear that what the government is doing, and what the cabinet is agreed on, is that what we base our future negotiations on, as we have done, are the principles laid out at Lancaster House. Asked about the spat between Johnson and the UK Statistics Authority, May refused to endorse the \u00a3350m a week figure \u2013 or the idea that any extra resources freed up by Brexit should be earmarked upfront for health spending. The issue about money going into the EU and then coming back to the UK: the reality is, year on year, the amount of money that the UK pays into the EU changes, for a whole variety of factors \u2013 but what I do know is that looking ahead, year on year on year, once we leave the EU, we will not be paying huge sums into the EU, and that will, of course, give us the opportunity as a government to decide how money that is available is then spent. Pressed on whether the NHS should be the top priority for additional funds, she insisted: \u201cThat will be a decision that will be taken at the time, and will be taken by the government\u201d. Privately, Number 10 was exasperated by Johnson\u2019s piece, which was not cleared in advance, and came as May prepares to deliver a major speech on Brexit in Florence on Friday. May was speaking to journalists on her RAF Voyager plane en route to Ottawa, where she was expected to discuss trade with prime minister Justin Trudeau, before flying on to New York to attend the UN General Assembly, where she is due to hold a series of bilateral meetings with other world leaders. May and Trudeau were expected to discuss the trade dispute between US airmaker Boeing and its Canadian rival Bombardier, which employs 4,500 workers in Northern Ireland; and the pair are expected to agree to open talks on a UK-Canadian trade deal, using the framework of the recently-concluded CETA deal between Canada and the EU. Dominic Cummings, who was Vote Leave\u2019s campaign director was a Boris Johnson ally during the EU referendum, has been using Twitter to condemn the way the government is handling Brexit. Cummings says the government\u2019s handling of Brexit has been a \u201cshambles\u201d. (To be fair, it is worth pointing out he is not someone given to understatement.) The ARPA is the Advanced Research Projects Agency. PARC is an American IT company. UPDATE: Sam Freedman, a former civil servant who worked with Dominic Cummings at the department for education, when Cummings was an adviser to Michael Gove, suggests it is not surprising he thinks the government\u2019s handling of Brexit has been a \u201cshambles\u201d; Cummings thinks that about how the government handles most things, Freedman points out. And the Conservative former minister Nick Boles was on the World at One too. He said he favoured a \u201creasonably long\u201d Brexit transition period, lasting two to three years. He also said that Tory MPs generally - both those who voted leave, and those like himself who voted remain - were \u201cfairly pragmatic\u201d about the need for the UK to make payments to the EU during the transition period, \u201cso long as it is temporary\u201d. He went on: We are all pretty relaxed about paying a fairly substantial amount - something not more than, but something not very far from our existing net contribution. Lord Kerslake, a former head of the civil service, told the BBC\u2019s World at One that he was \u201csurprised\u201d to see Oliver Robbins being replaced as permanent secretary at DExEU, the department for leaving the EU. Kerslake told the programme: I am surprised I have to be honest. I know Ollie well, he\u2019s a very able and serious minded civil servant ... but it seems an odd point to make this kind of change. And I wonder how he can lead a process of negotiation and not also be leading the department responsible for that process. There are the resources that he should have at his command in order to drive the process, and splitting that, having someone else running the department, and him being in the Cabinet Office, to my mind, splits the responsibility and therefore the clarity of the process. [Robbins] was both reporting to David Davis and in to the Cabinet Office already, so he had a line into Number 10 under the current structure that has been there from the start. It is difficult to understand why moving him out into the Cabinet Office changes that fundamental dynamic. It does feel a bit like rearranging the deckchairs, to be honest. Downing Street has refused to take sides in an acrimonious dispute between Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, and the UK Statistics Authority over the accuracy of his claim that leaving the EU will enable Britain to \u201ctake back control of roughly \u00a3350 million per week\u201d. (See 9.32am.) The figure does not represent how much the British taxpayer will save, and even though Johnson used more nuanced language when he revived it in his Telegraph article last week, the UK Statistics Authority accused him of \u201ca clear misuse of official statistics.\u201d Asked what Theresa May believed was the figure supposedly being paid to the EU by Britain, the prime minister\u2019s spokeswoman told journalists at the lobby briefing she was \u201cnot getting into the ins and outs of the figures\u201d, and suggested people should research the veracity of the sum themselves. What I would say more generally, all of the UK\u2019s contributions to the EU budget are published online and you can go and have a look at them. Pressed on whether the UK Statistics Authority or Johnson was right, she added: I\u2019m not getting into that. The figures are published by the Treasury. They\u2019ve been publishing them every year since the 1980s, a paper called European Finance. But some Tories have backed Johnson. Michael Gove, the environment secretary who led the Vote Leave campaign alongside Johnson, defended his interpretation. And the Tory backbencher Nadine Dorries, a staunch Johnson supporter, said Sir David Norgrove should be sacked as head of the UK Statistics Authority for questioning what Johnson said. The UK\u2019s most senior Brexit official has been moved from David Davis\u2019s department and into a new role advising Theresa May on talks with the EU. The Low Pay Commission, which sets the level of the minimum wage, has said that up to one in five workers who should be getting it may be getting less. Bryan Sanderson, the commission\u2019s chair, said: The low pay commission has always had a strong interest in compliance with the minimum wage rates it recommends. There is, after all, little point in having a minimum wage if workers do not receive the correct rate. With more workers than ever paid the minimum wage or close to it, more people are at risk of being underpaid. Our analysis finds that up to 1 in 5 people who should be paid at least the minimum wage may in fact receive less. This equates to between 305,000 and 580,000 workers at its highest point, though it is a difficult thing to measure. The LPC welcomes the recent increases in funding for HMRC\u2019s enforcement of the minimum wage, and recognises the progress it has made. However, we also think there is more the Government could do to identify non-compliance and stop it happening in the first place. In our report we lay out recommendations for ways the government could go further. The Brexit department has published its proposals for a new UK-EU security treaty to \u201clock in\u201d membership of Europol, the European arrest warrant and other existing joint measures to combat crime and terrorism after Brexit. You can read the paper here. The pro-Brexit Conservative backbencher John Redwood has said that he is opposed to a Brexit transition period and that paying money to the EU after the UK leaves could be illegal. James Chapman, a former aide to the Brexit secretary David Davis, has said Brexit will not happen because there is not enough parliamentary support for leaving the single market. Speaking at a fringe event at the Lib Dem conference Chapman said: The government must trigger by next March Article 127 in EEA treaty laws to leave the European Economic Area ... Is there a majority in the House of Commons to leave the single market? No, there\u2019s not - absolutely not. So the government will not be able to get that through Parliament and at that point Brexit will collapse, because the British people will say, \u2018we are going to have to stay in the single market and we will have pay more to stay in and we\u2019re not going to be able to control free movement\u2019. Vince Cable has likened Theresa May to a school headteacher \u201cbarricaded in her own office\u201d as he predicted the unfolding internal unrest within the Conservative party could boost the Liberal Democrats. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, has announced that a new Scottish social security agency, being set up following the Scottish government getting new powers over benefits, will be based in Dundee. Theresa May is planning to raise a dispute between two aerospace companies in North America that threatens jobs in Northern Ireland with Canada\u2019s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Plane maker Boeing is taking Canadian rival Bombardier to court alleging the latter enjoyed an anti-competitive advantage due to state support from the Quebec regional government. Bombardier is Northern Ireland\u2019s largest employer in terms of manufacturing and makes the wings for the CSeries passenger jets in its East Belfast plant. Last week the prime minister telephoned Donald Trump to raise the court case and the threat to the CSeries contract which could put jobs in jeopardy in Belfast. May is expected to discuss the Bombardier versus Boeing case with prime minister Trudeau when they meet later today in Ottawa. She will urge her Canadian counterpart to encourage Boeing to drop its case. Canada has already threatened to withdraw an order for fighter jets its military has sought from Boeing if the Seattle based aerospace giant continues its legal battle with Bombardier. East Belfast is represented in the House of Commons by Democratic Unionist MP Gavin Robinson. May and her minority Conservative government needs his and the votes of his nine fellow DUP MPs to remain in power. This is from the Financial Times\u2019 Jim Pickard. Pickard is referring to James Chapman, Davis\u2019s special adviser until the general election, who is now using his Twitter feed to denounce Brexit as a complete disaster; Lord Bridges of Headley, who resigned as a Brexit minister after the election and recently used a speech in the Lords to suggest the government was not being honest about the challenges presented by Brexit; and David Jones, who was sacked as a Brexit minister after the election. Here is Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, on Oliver Robbins\u2019 move. And here is the Evening Standard\u2019s editorial on Boris Johnson, the Tories and Brexit. George Osborne\u2019s paper is arguing that Johnson wrote his Telegraph article to try to stop Theresa May using her Florence speech to offer the EU a compromise, involving the UK being willing to pay in return for a transition deal. Here is an excerpt. For as each month passes without even an agreement in principle to a transition, companies that operate within EU legal regimes (such as banks, airlines and pharmaceuticals) are starting to get nervous and considering relocating parts of their business. That\u2019s why Mrs May has, quite rightly, blinked \u2014 and wants to use her Florence speech to make the sensible offer of money in return for a transition. There\u2019s only one problem. Her foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, will be humiliated if she does. For he travelled around the country last year promising people that far from paying billions for leaving the EU, we\u2019d get \u00a3350 million a week back ... As a journalist turned politician, he has chosen his weapon of choice \u2014 the long newspaper column \u2014 to lash out. In doing so, he has thrown away a year of effort at trying to become the team player, sought again to divide the nation rather than unite it, and revived (with help from the UK Statistics Authority) his reputation for being economical with the truth. But Mr Johnson had little choice. For if Mrs May gives the speech she wants to in Florence, he faces the kind of fatal blow the Medicis would have been familiar with. Here is the Evening Standard\u2019s take on Oliver Robbins losing his post as permanent secretary at the Brexit department. Rupert Harrison, who was chief of staff to George Osborne, the Standard editor, when Osborne was chancellor, thinks his former boss has gone a bit OTT. Charlie Cooper\u2019s article for Politico Europe two weeks ago about the tensions between David Davis and his (then) permanent secretary, Oliver Robbins, says that the problem was partly caused by Robbins showing greater allegiance to Theresa May than to Davis. Here\u2019s an extract. Prior to the election, there were \u201csignificant numbers of written advice items which went straight from Olly to the prime minister and weren\u2019t necessarily seen by David Davis beforehand,\u201d the ex-official said, adding that Davis was even frozen out of the early drafting of May\u2019s pivotal Lancaster House speech in January, in which the prime minister laid out her vision for Brexit. One senior official said problems remain. \u201cOlly does things which DD isn\u2019t aware of,\u201d the official said. \u201cThat Robbins-May dynamic is a constant source of frustration for David Davis.\u201d Then the election result changed the dynamic of the relationship, Cooper says. \u201cOn the morning of 9th June, the day after the election, DD was in there being an adviser, trying to stake his position,\u201d the ex-official said. \u201cHe tried to place himself very firmly in the inner circle in the immediate post-election aftermath. Since, he has placed himself at the center of the negotiations and used the changed dynamic at No. 10, the prime minister\u2019s relative weakness at Cabinet, and the departure of Nick, to get more of a grip.\u201d \u201cHe must have been the first minister to speak to her that day,\u201d a current official said of Davis\u2019 alignment with May the day after the election ... \u201cThe prime minister is personally weakened since the election. David Davis, personally, I would say, is in a strengthened position. I think that Robbins probably recognizes that shift in strength,\u201d said one senior MP and Davis ally. Government sources are rejecting suggestions that Oliver Robbins\u2019 move from DExEU to the Cabinet Office means that he is being sidelined. Instead his move is just an acknowledgement of the fact that, with the Brexit negotiations about to intensify, \u201cthe workload of running a department would be better handled by someone else\u201d, one source said. The source said that Robbins could continue to be the lead official in the Brexit negotiating team and that, when David Davis, the Brexit secretary, appeared in Brussels to negotiate with his EU opposite number, Michel Barnier, Davis would continue to appear flanked by Robbins and Sir Tim Barrow, the UK\u2019s ambassador to the EU. Two weeks ago Politico Europe published a long report claiming that relations between Robbins and Davis were strained. Sources are downplaying this, and insisting that it is not a relevant factor in this move, although putting Robbins in the Cabinet Office will result in him having less contact with Davis on a day to day basis. An alternative interpretation would be that this amounts to May taking a firmer grip over the Brexit talks. May has a good relationship with Robbins. According to the Politico Europe article: Robbins has a longstanding relationship with May, having served with her at the Home Office. They are \u201cunbelievably close,\u201d a former colleague of them both said. An ex-official added: \u201cShe clearly trusts him, more so than some of the other senior Europe advisers, and other permanent secretaries. You can see it whenever they interact, she takes his steer on a lot of this stuff.\u201d DExEU, the department for exiting the EU, has put out this statement about Oliver Robbins\u2019 move. A spokesman said: In order to strengthen cross government co-ordination of the next phase of negotiations with the European Union, the prime minister has appointed Oliver Robbins as her EU adviser in the Cabinet Office, in addition to his role as EU sherpa. He will continue to lead the official-side UK team in the negotiations, working closely with the secretary of state for Exiting the European Union, and coordinate relations with the commission and member states. The prime minister has appointed Philip Rycroft, currently second permanent secretary at the department for exiting the EU and Cabinet Office, as permanent secretary, Department for Exiting the EU. The department will continue to support David Davis, the secretary of state for Exiting the EU, to ensure a smooth exit and to seize the opportunities presented by leaving the EU. This will include his role as principal of the negotiations, leading on exit-related legislation, domestic preparedness for exit and engagement with stakeholders in the UK, including the devolved administrations, and in the EU27 and beyond. Oliver (Olly) Robbins, permanent secretary at DExEU (the department for exiting the EU, and the government\u2019s lead official on Brexit, is moving, the BBC reports. These are from the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg. It should not be hard to adjudicate in any dispute about the accuracy of statistics between the UK Statistics Authority and Boris Johnson. After all, the UK Statistics Authority is an internationally respected body chaired by an esteemed economist. Boris Johnson is also renowned, but he is not revered for his commitment to accuracy. In fact, as a Europe correspondent before he became an MP, he was notorious for his unreliability. At his Brussels leaving do a colleague recited a spoof of Belloc\u2019s Matilda starting: \u201cBoris told such dreadful lies/ It made one gasp and stretch one\u2019s eyes./ His desk, which from its earliest youth/ Had kept a strict regard for truth,/ Attempted to believe each scoop/ Until they landed in the soup.\u201d So why is Downing Street refusing to take sides? Perhaps it is just because Theresa May is airborne, en route to Canada, and the press office does not want to pre-empt what she says when asked about this herself, either by journalists on the plane or at the press conference later. However, there is a good chance that, even when May does address this in person, she will refuse to take sides. She could not disown the UK Statistics Authority without severely undermine its reputation (and, in the eyes of many observers, probably her own too). But if she were to publicly back the government\u2019s statistics watchdog, she would be implicitly accusing Johnson of misrepresentation. It is the sort of thing that could provoke him to resign. Even before Johnson\u2019s article appeared in the Telegraph there were reports saying Downing Street was worried about him flouncing out of government before the Tory conference. May will not want to give him a pretext. This is from the Times\u2019 Francis Elliott from last week. My colleague Peter Walker is just back from the Number 10 lobby briefing. Here are the key points. No 10 refuses to take sides in row between Boris Johnson and UK\u2019s Statistics Authority over accuracy of his \u00a3350m per week claim. Some commentators have questioned Sir David Norgrove\u2019s decision to intervene in the argument about Boris Johnson\u2019s use of the \u00a3350m figure. (See 9.32am.) This is from Fraser Nelson, editor of the Spectator, which Johnson himself used to edit. And here is an extract from the article (paywall) by the Spectator\u2019s Steerpike columnist that Nelson is referencing. In fact, it\u2019s impossible to make the argument about control without referring to a gross figure. Taxation is routinely referred to as gross: the lower-paid half of the country gets all of its money back (and more) in public services. But people still talk about the sum that\u2019s taken from them, and understandably so. Those who advocate lower taxes emphasise \u2013 as Boris does \u2013 control. That people spend their own money better on themselves than the government does on their behalf. So the gross figure is, obviously, the most relevant. Doubtless Sir David doesn\u2019t like this argument, but in trying to say that it\u2019s illegitimate \u2013 or somehow an \u201cclear misuse\u201d of statistics \u2013 he is over-reaching and calling the neutrality of his office into doubt. During the campaign, Sir David\u2019s more measured predecessor Andrew Dilnot was called in to adjudicate in the \u00a3350 million figure being used in genuinely dodgy way (ie, leading people to suspect that this was the net payment that could be recouped after Brexit). Dilnot rightly said that this was \u2018potentially misleading\u2019 \u2013 ie, if used the wrong context. Emphasis on \u2018potentially\u2019. But the lawyer and legal blogger Matthew Scott says Norgrove was just doing what he is expected to do under the code of practice for official statistics. \u201cThe government faces a growing revolt from carmakers in Britain unhappy at the slow pace of clarity over post-Brexit customs arrangements crucial to their business model\u201d, Sky\u2019s political editor Faisal Islam writes in a good Sky \u201cBrexit Forensics\u201d investigation. You can read it in full here. Nigel Farage, the former Ukip leader, liked Boris Johnson\u2019s Telegraph article. In his Today interview John Redwood, the pro-Brexit Conservative, also said that he was opposed to a Brexit transition period. He told the programme: I think it\u2019s much better not to have a transition period. Indeed, I think the remaining 19 months [before Brexit] could be a transition period of there are things we need to change in order to comply with the new agreement. What we need to do now is concentrate on the [future UK-EU] agreement, not on some kind of transition agreement. We need to know if we are going to be transiting to something we want to do, or whether there isn\u2019t an agreement on offer, so we won\u2019t be transiting to that at all. He also said the UK should not continue paying money to the EU after Brexit for access to the single market. He said: Many of us don\u2019t think there is any moral or political or legal reason to go on paying them once we have left. Indeed, I think it would be illegal to go on paying them once we have left. And I find it very odd how many people there are around government, in official circles and advising government, who seem to think the British people want to pay a lot of money to the EU after we have resigned from the club. They don\u2019t, I can assure you ... When it comes to trade, it is a very odd idea that you need to pay to import BMWs or whatever and make a payment to the EU. Redwood\u2019s position puts him clearly at odds with the government in two respects. First, even the pro-Brexit cabinet minsters now accept that a transition period will be necessary. Second, it is accepted in government that a Brexit deal will involve some payments to the EU after Brexit. It seems likely that, in practice, these could be implicitly connected to single market access. But whether there will be a formal link is another matter, because the EU is demanding money as the UK\u2019s share of outstanding EU budget obligations and these payments would not formally be linked to single market access. In perhaps the most important line in his Telegraph article (paywall), Boris Johnson said an explicit link between payments to the EU and single market access would be unacceptable. He said: We would not expect to pay for access to their markets any more than they would expect to pay for access to ours. Chris Giles, the Financial Times\u2019 economics editor, has identified another spurious claim in Boris Johnson\u2019s Telegraph article (paywall). Johnson wrote: We should seize the opportunity of Brexit to reform our tax system. Andy Haldane, the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist, argued in 2015 that our system is currently skewed so as to discourage investment. He believes that reform could raise output by around 20 per cent. Giles explains the problems with this on his Twitter feed. This is from ITV\u2019s Carl Dinnen. Michael Gove, the environment secretary and a fellow leader of the Vote Leave campaign alongside Boris Johnson, has defended Johnson\u2019s right to use the \u00a3350m per week figure for the cost of the EU, while also urging people to move on. He has just posted these on Twitter. On the Today programme this morning John Redwood, the pro-Brexit Conservative backbencher, backed Boris Johnson over the \u00a3350m figure. It was \u201centirely true\u201d for the Vote Leave campaign to say last year that \u00a3350m per week was the gross contribution to the EU. It was a bit higher now, he said. That is the official figure. The statistical disagreement is not over whether that is the gross figure or not. As I understand it, the statistical intervention is that he should have used a net figure rather than the gross figure. But, interestingly, Jacob Rees-Mogg, another leading Tory leave campaigner, was not willing to defend the \u00a3350m figure in his Daily Telegraph article (paywall). The article is generally very supportive of Johnson, but Rees-Mogg pointedly does not claim that leaving the EU will immediately free up \u00a3350m per week for the NHS. Instead he says: The positivity of Boris Johnson uses the settling of our account with the EU to boost public services. He wants to deliver on the promise to ensure better funding of the NHS by using the money we will save by leaving the EU, \u00a310bn, or nearly \u00a3200m a week. That will come straight away as long as we do not agree some unnecessary divorce payout, and the next \u00a3150m, which was implied if not formally pledged by the Leave campaign, can be found if we can grow our economy. Here is the BBC\u2019s Reality Check on the \u00a3350m claim. But Dominic Cummings, the Vote Leave campaign director who tweets as @odysseanproject, defended the figure over the weekend, highlighting what Sir Andrew Dilnot, Sir David Norgrove\u2019s predecessor as chair of the UK Statistics Authority, told a Commons committee in April last year. As Anushka Asthana reports in our overnight splash, Sir David Norgrove, the head of the UK Statistics Authority, criticised Boris Johnson for suggesting in his Daily Telegraph article that leaving the EU will free up \u00a3350m a week for the UK government. Johnson rejected Norgrove\u2019s criticism. For the record, this is how Johnson phrased the claim in his article (paywall). And yes \u2013 once we have settled our accounts, we will take back control of roughly \u00a3350 million per week. It would be a fine thing, as many of us have pointed out, if a lot of that money went on the NHS, provided we use that cash injection to modernise and make the most of new technology. The Telegraph splash headline was less nuanced (as headlines always are.) Here is the full text of the letter Norgrove sent to Johnson about this claim. Dear Foreign Secretary, I am surprised and disappointed that you have chosen to repeat the figure of \u00a3350m per week, in connection with the amount that might be available for extra public spending when we leave the European Union. This confuses gross and net contributions. It also assumes that payments currently made to the UK by the EU, including for example for the support of agriculture and scientific research, will not be paid by the UK government when we leave. It is a clear misuse of official statistics. Yours sincerely Sir David Norgrove And here is the full text of Johnson\u2019s reply to Norgrove. Dear Sir David I must say that I was surprised and disappointed by your letter of today, since it was based on what appeared to be a wilful distortion of the text of my article. When we spoke you conceded that you were more concerned by the headline and the BBC coverage, though you accepted that I was not responsible for those. I suggest if the BBC coverage offends you that you write to the BBC. You say that I claim that there would be \u00a3350m that \u201cmight be available for extra public spending\u201d when we leave the EU. This is a complete misrepresentation of what I said and I would like you to withdraw it. I in fact said: \u201cOnce we have settled our accounts we will take back control of roughly \u00a3350m per week. It would be a fine thing, as many of us have pointed out, if a lot of that money went on the NHS.\u201d That is very different from claiming that there would be an extra \u00a3350m available for public spending and I am amazed that you should impute such a statement to me. You claim in your defence that we would not really be taking back control of that sum, because it includes the rebate and other EU spending in this country. But, as you accept, these sums - amounting to about half the \u00a3350m - are spent at the discretion of the EU. We do not control them. To give you an example: when I was mayor of London I thought it would be a good idea if we persuaded the commission to spend \u00a38m on the Emirates cable car. We succeeded, and the commissioner concerned was so delighted with the results that he said he would like to fund some more cable cars in London. I was delighted, too, and was glad to have steered some of our EU contributions back to this country. But the decision was his. Control was in the hands of the commission, not the UK. Or do you suggest otherwise ? As for the balance of the \u00a3350m, it of course disappears around the rest of the EU, and is spent as the EU sees fit in other countries. Once we leave the EU we will take back control of all such UK-funded spending, and, although of course I have no doubt that we will continue to spend significantly on UK priorities such as agriculture and research, that spending will be done under UK control. As for the rebate - whose value you did not know - it only forms part of the EU\u2019s financing arrangements with the agreement of all other EU member states. We do not control it ourselves. What is beyond doubt is that, upon withdrawal, we will have complete discretion over the \u00a3350m per week and that huge sums will indeed will be available for public spending on priorities such as the NHS. I believe that would be a fine thing. If you had any concerns about my article, it would of course have been open to you to address the points with me in private rather than in this way in a public letter. As it is, if you seriously disagree with any of the above, I look forward to hearing your reasoning. Boris Johnson Secretary of State for Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Affairs Good morning. It is more than 48 hours since Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, published his long, provocative Brexit essay in the Daily Telegraph but his intervention is still dominating the talk at Westminster and dividing Conservative. Here are two Tories who have spoken out against him overnight. George Freeman, who chairs the Conservative party\u2019s policy forum and the prime minister\u2019s policy board, told the Westminster Hour last night that he thought Johnson was wrong to suggest that Brexit would lead to the UK government being able to spend an extra \u00a3350m a week and that a lot of the money should go to the NHS. Freeman said: Personally I think the \u00a3350 million figure is just far too early to be able to make wild promises about what exactly is going to be coming out of the Brexit negotiations ... It\u2019s not a figure I would have repeated, and he\u2019s not the health secretary and it needs to be negotiated. And Tobias Ellwood, who was a minister in the Foreign Office under Johnson until June, used Twitter to accuse his former boss of fomenting disunity. But in an article in the Daily Telegraph (paywall), Jacob Rees-Mogg, the pro-Brexit backbencher, says Johnson has made Theresa May \u201cstronger\u201d because he has set out a positive vision for Brexit. Needless to say, Boris\u2019 critics, a small but noisy group, see this as a leadership bid, but in truth it helps the Government and boosts Mrs May. As the foreign secretary he is quite reasonably setting out an enthusiastic case for Britain\u2019s future position in the world. That is what he ought to do; it is part of his job. He is loyally putting forward Government policy as outlined by the Prime Minister in her Lancaster House speech, and is doing so with panache to explain why this approach will benefit the nation. Not for Boris snide anonymous briefings allegedly by friends; instead a double page spread in the Daily Telegraph promoting the cause of conservatism in the nation. And John Redwood, another backbench pro-Brexiteer, defended Johnson\u2019s use of the \u00a3350m figure on the Today programme this morning and argued that it was the Treasury, not Johnson, that was trying to alter government Brexit policy. There will be a lot more on this all day, I\u2019m afraid. And this afternoon we will be hearing what May herself as to say about it all. Here is the agenda for the day. 9am: The Liberal Democrat conference resumes in Bournemouth. At 11am Tim Farron, the former leader, will be speaking. I will be covering conference events from London today, but tomorrow I will be in Bournemouth for Sir Vince Cable\u2019s speech on the final day of the conference. 11am: Downing Street lobby briefing. 12.30am: DExEU (the department for exiting the EU) publishes its partnership paper on security, law enforcement and criminal justice. As Alan Travis reports, it will propose a new UK-EU security treaty to \u201clock in\u201d membership of Europol, the European arrest warrant and other existing joint measures to combat crime and terrorism after Brexit. 4.30pm (UK time): Theresa May meets the Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau in Canada. They are due to hold a joint press conference at 5.30pm. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another in the afternoon. You can read all today\u2019s Guardian politics stories here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news from Jack Blanchard\u2019s Playbook. Here is the ConservativeHome round up of today\u2019s politics stories in the papers. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on@AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but normally I find it impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer direct questions, although sometimes I miss them or don\u2019t have time. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

Now that the UK has entered into the difficult early stages of negotiating its way out of the European Union, May and her government might want to take note while in North America of how another trade relationship works and how Canada, specifically, handles its role within it.</p> <p>Donald Trump\u2019s election put the spotlight on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Free_Trade_Agreement\" title=\"\">North American Free Trade Agreement</a> (Nafta), a deal between the US, Canada and Mexico that covers everything from avocados to lumber to Ski-Doos. Trump has made it clear that he <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/video/2016/06/28/trump-nafta-worst-trade-deal-in-history.html\" title=\"\">believes Nafta</a> to be \u201cthe worst trade deal ever signed\u201d. The goal, as far as Trump is concerned? Regain control. As with similar promises from Brexiters, the impossibilities of such economic independence were totally ignored in favour of rhetoric. The unprecedented trade talks requested by both Trump and the Brexiters have arrived, and the way by which both Canada and the UK have approached negotiations is a study in contrasts \u2013 one that could be instructive for May.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/24/nafta-failed-american-workers-congresswoman-marcy-kaptur\">Nafta failed American workers. Here's how Trump can fix our trade woes | Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Whether Canada bargains at the Nafta table from a position of strength or weakness depends on who you ask and when, but the overall picture is that of an uneven partnership. The US <a href=\"https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/americas/canada\" title=\"\">claims it carries a trade deficit with Canada</a> (it does not), but the overall Canadian economy depends more on America than the other way around. But this allows Canada to naturally land a key mental leap \u2013 one the Brexiters in May\u2019s government should study. That is, while Canada has long accepted its lot as a junior partner in its relationship with the US, it also knows doing so doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s not in a position of considerable power or influence. It all depends on the approach.</p> <p>After the Trump administration prompted Nafta renegotiations, Canada pushed a charm offensive. It routed its diplomatic forays around the White House and down to the congressional and state level. As <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/story/trudeau-is-lobbying-washington-to-save-canadas-biggest-trade-deal-from-trump\" title=\"\">Vice News</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-03/do-no-harm-in-nafta-talks-canadian-businesses-tell-trudeau\" title=\"\">Bloomberg</a> first reported, Trudeau\u2019s office dispatched as many as 18 cabinet ministers to lobby states directly and to remind them of the importance of Canada\u2019s trade relationship in a more local context. Ministers held meetings, shook hands, and smiled for some <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/wooing-america/\" title=\"\">Instagram photos</a>.</p> <p>Unlike the exchanges between the UK and the EU, Canada\u2019s official verbal dust-ups with the US have been muted. As the renegotiations got under way, chief US negotiator Robert Lighthizer took <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8bd9cabe-829b-11e7-a4ce-15b2513cb3ff\" title=\"\">direct aim</a> at both Mexico and Canada, clarifying that Trump \u201cis not interested in a mere tweaking of a few provisions and a couple of updated chapters\u201d, but rather a rewrite. \u201cWe feel that Nafta has fundamentally failed many, many Americans and needs major improvement,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Canada\u2019s foreign affairs minister, Chrystia Freeland, didn\u2019t directly retaliate. Rather, her response was in keeping with the overall tone Canada adopted from the outset: measured, calm, and reminding of a mutually beneficial relationship. More Canadian, if you will. \u201cWe pursue trade, free and fair, knowing it is not a zero-sum game,\u201d Freeland said, before pointing out that \u201cthat we are the biggest client of the United States\u201d.</p> <p>For their part, Justin Trudeau and Donald Trump share what is, at least in public, a congenial relationship. Trudeau is cautious to never sound like he\u2019s attacking the president directly, and Trudeau\u2019s inner circle has worked to establish friendly ties with his closest advisers. How much of it is genuine or merely for the cameras is immaterial; it\u2019s in service of a greater goal. You catch more flies with maple syrup, I suppose.</p> <p>There are genuine points of contest between Canada and the US when it comes to rewriting Nafta, and there will be disagreements in the course of its renegotiation. Nafta may <a href=\"http://nationalpost.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/nafta-u-s-wants-to-insert-5-year-termination-clause-in-the-agreement\" title=\"\">even yet be destroyed</a>. May\u2019s Conservative government has an arguably <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/33f3d722-97d1-11e7-b83c-9588e51488a0\" title=\"\">tougher task</a> with regards to the EU, but expecting Brussels to acquiesce, or to bend to Britain\u2019s will, is fantastical thinking. It\u2019s not going to happen \u2013 certainly not in a way in which the Brexiters\u2019 lofty guarantees can be met.</p> <p>With their vote to split from the EU, Britons perhaps unknowingly accepted a simultaneous fate of creating a lopsided economic relationship, with the UK dependent on the EU\u2019s moves, rather than the other way around. In a way, Britons voted for the UK to become the Canada of Europe. Maybe it\u2019s time it started acting like it.</p> <p>\u2022 Colin Horgan is a former speechwriter for Justin Trudeau</p>",

          "bodyText": "When Theresa May visits Ottawa on Monday, she might have more to learn from Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau than what socks to wear to the United Nations, or how to win a majority. Now that the UK has entered into the difficult early stages of negotiating its way out of the European Union, May and her government might want to take note while in North America of how another trade relationship works and how Canada, specifically, handles its role within it. Donald Trump\u2019s election put the spotlight on the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), a deal between the US, Canada and Mexico that covers everything from avocados to lumber to Ski-Doos. Trump has made it clear that he believes Nafta to be \u201cthe worst trade deal ever signed\u201d. The goal, as far as Trump is concerned? Regain control. As with similar promises from Brexiters, the impossibilities of such economic independence were totally ignored in favour of rhetoric. The unprecedented trade talks requested by both Trump and the Brexiters have arrived, and the way by which both Canada and the UK have approached negotiations is a study in contrasts \u2013 one that could be instructive for May. Whether Canada bargains at the Nafta table from a position of strength or weakness depends on who you ask and when, but the overall picture is that of an uneven partnership. The US claims it carries a trade deficit with Canada (it does not), but the overall Canadian economy depends more on America than the other way around. But this allows Canada to naturally land a key mental leap \u2013 one the Brexiters in May\u2019s government should study. That is, while Canada has long accepted its lot as a junior partner in its relationship with the US, it also knows doing so doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s not in a position of considerable power or influence. It all depends on the approach. After the Trump administration prompted Nafta renegotiations, Canada pushed a charm offensive. It routed its diplomatic forays around the White House and down to the congressional and state level. As Vice News and Bloomberg first reported, Trudeau\u2019s office dispatched as many as 18 cabinet ministers to lobby states directly and to remind them of the importance of Canada\u2019s trade relationship in a more local context. Ministers held meetings, shook hands, and smiled for some Instagram photos. Unlike the exchanges between the UK and the EU, Canada\u2019s official verbal dust-ups with the US have been muted. As the renegotiations got under way, chief US negotiator Robert Lighthizer took direct aim at both Mexico and Canada, clarifying that Trump \u201cis not interested in a mere tweaking of a few provisions and a couple of updated chapters\u201d, but rather a rewrite. \u201cWe feel that Nafta has fundamentally failed many, many Americans and needs major improvement,\u201d he said. Canada\u2019s foreign affairs minister, Chrystia Freeland, didn\u2019t directly retaliate. Rather, her response was in keeping with the overall tone Canada adopted from the outset: measured, calm, and reminding of a mutually beneficial relationship. More Canadian, if you will. \u201cWe pursue trade, free and fair, knowing it is not a zero-sum game,\u201d Freeland said, before pointing out that \u201cthat we are the biggest client of the United States\u201d. For their part, Justin Trudeau and Donald Trump share what is, at least in public, a congenial relationship. Trudeau is cautious to never sound like he\u2019s attacking the president directly, and Trudeau\u2019s inner circle has worked to establish friendly ties with his closest advisers. How much of it is genuine or merely for the cameras is immaterial; it\u2019s in service of a greater goal. You catch more flies with maple syrup, I suppose. There are genuine points of contest between Canada and the US when it comes to rewriting Nafta, and there will be disagreements in the course of its renegotiation. Nafta may even yet be destroyed. May\u2019s Conservative government has an arguably tougher task with regards to the EU, but expecting Brussels to acquiesce, or to bend to Britain\u2019s will, is fantastical thinking. It\u2019s not going to happen \u2013 certainly not in a way in which the Brexiters\u2019 lofty guarantees can be met. With their vote to split from the EU, Britons perhaps unknowingly accepted a simultaneous fate of creating a lopsided economic relationship, with the UK dependent on the EU\u2019s moves, rather than the other way around. In a way, Britons voted for the UK to become the Canada of Europe. Maybe it\u2019s time it started acting like it. \u2022 Colin Horgan is a former speechwriter for Justin Trudeau",

          "bodyText": "Boris Johnson faced growing pressure over his intervention on Brexit as Cabinet colleagues lined up to question his actions and he was accused of a \u201cclear misuse of official statistics\u201d. Sir David Norgrove, the head of the UK Statistics Authority, said he was \u201csurprised and disappointed\u201d to see the foreign secretary restate the controversial claim that Britain will claw back \u00a3350m a week after leaving the EU, triggering a war of words between the pair. Johnson hit back in a strongly worded letter in which he accused Norgrove of a \u201cwilful distortion of the text of my article\u201d, claiming it was a misrepresentation and demanding it be withdrawn. And although there were claims that Michael Gove backed Johnson over the decision to lay out his views on Brexit just days before May\u2019s critical speech, a spokesman said: \u201cThe first Michael knew about Boris\u2019s article was when it was published on Friday night.\u201d They also made clear that Gove accepted the idea of a two-year transition period including payments from the UK \u2013 in contrast to Johnson who wants a maximum of a year and no money offered for access to markets. Meanwhile, a senior Whitehall official told the Guardian that Johnson\u2019s 4,000-word vision of Brexit, which was not cleared by Downing Street, would make life more difficult for the dozens of negotiators in the Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU). The official claimed it would also be harder for Theresa May to strike the right tone in a major speech to be delivered in Florence on Friday. There was anger from some Cabinet colleagues with one accusing the foreign secretary of an unhelpful move that placed \u201cpersonal ambition ahead before the interests of the country\u201d. They said that he cared more about meeting the \u201cdiscredited promises of the leave campaign\u201d than delivering the best Brexit for Britain after the article was published without Downing Street\u2019s agreement. The home secretary, Amber Rudd, also questioned the timing of the intervention, on the evening of the Parsons Green terror attack, and said Johnson was guilty of \u201cbackseat driving\u201d. During an interview on BBC1\u2019s Andrew Marr Show, she made clear that while the intervention was \u201cabsolutely fine\u201d, she did not want the foreign secretary \u201cmanaging the Brexit process\u201d. Downing Street has insisted that Johnson did not contradict government policy, although there was some irritation that the article was not cleared. And critics were quick to point out that he failed to mention transition in the article, and said it would be wrong to pay for access to markets. That is despite the fact that the government is looking more likely to be willing to offer payments during an implementation period. However, despite claims from some that Johnson had chosen a bad moment for the article and that it was disloyal and represented a future leadership bid, May\u2019s close ally \u2013 Damian Green \u2013 made clear that the foreign secretary was not facing the sack. \u201cNo, he isn\u2019t and the reason is, he, like the rest of the cabinet, like the prime minister, is all about wanting to get the best deal for the British people,\u201d the first secretary of state told Sunday with Paterson on Sky News. There were reports that cabinet members, including Priti Patel, backed Johnson\u2019s bolder vision for Brexit. Although Gove was not informed, he was reluctant to criticise his former Vote Leave colleague and clearly backed him on many of the points raised, including the idea of a Brexit dividend that could be spent on public services. Reports suggest both men have been consulting one of the architects of the Vote Leave campaign, Dominic Cummings. However, the pair do seem to have a different view on the question of transition. Sources suggest Johnson wants a short period of six months to a year, but say Gove\u2019s time in the environment department has convinced him of the need for two years for implementation, with the UK continuing to pay in. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Brexit-supporting Tory MP who has been talked about as a potential future leadership candidate, said he completely backed Johnson. \u201cBoris is right to emphasise the positive opportunities that come from Brexit. Government is not about \u2018managing decline\u2019 but ensuring a more prosperous future which we can do freed from the European Union\u2019s yoke.\u201d A source close to the foreign secretary hit back at the suggestion by a Whitehall source that the 4,000-word article would make negotiations harder saying \u201cthe irony of that kind of comment is clearly lost on the official who said it\u201d. And Johnson himself reacted angrily to the intervention of the country\u2019s statistics chief. In a letter to to the foreign secretary, Norgrove slapped down the use of the \u00a3350m figure, arguing: \u201cThis confuses gross and net contributions. It also assumes that payments currently made to the UK by the EU, including, for example, for the support of agriculture and scientific research, will not be paid by the UK government when we leave.\u201d It added: \u201cIt is a clear misuse of official statistics.\u201d But Johnson hit back with a letter accusing Norgrove of a \u201ccomplete misrepresentation of what I said\u201d and demanded the letter be withdrawn. \u201cI must say that I was surprised and disappointed by your letter of today, since it was based on what appeared to be a wilful distortion of the text in my article.\u201d Johnson was backed on Monday by John Redwood, the strongly pro-Brexit Tory backbencher, who said the \u00a3350m claim was \u201centirely true\u201d.

The suicide epidemic affecting First Nations communities across Canada has been a national crisis for decades, but it attracted international headlines after three indigenous communities were moved to declare a state of emergency in response to a series of deaths. In the spring of 2016, Attawapiskat First Nation reserve in Ontario declared a state of emergency after 11 young people tried to commit suicide in one night \u2013 adding to the estimated 100 attempts made over 10 months among this community of 2,000 people. Not long after, it was revealed that six people, including a 14-year-old girl, had killed themselves over a period of three months in the Pimicikamak Cree Nation community of northern Manitoba. In the aftermath, more than 150 youths in this remote community of 6,000 were put on suicide watch.

          "body": "<h2>Top story: Mass overstaying of study visas exploded as myth </h2> <p>Hello \u2013 it\u2019s Warren Murray helping you sound well informed at the water cooler today.</p> <p>Theresa May has been left embarrassed and isolated as immigration figures prove foreign students constitute a much smaller risk of overstaying their visas than the government has contended. It puts the prime minister under increased pressure to exclude students from the perennially unachieved Conservative pledge to bring immigration down to the \u201ctens of thousands\u201d.</p> <p>The Home Office previously estimated there were 100,000 students a year staying on illegally \u2013 but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/aug/24/pressure-grows-for-immigration-targets-to-exclude-foreign-students\">new data from the Office of National Statistics says there were only 4,600 last year</a>. \u201cWe spent five years trying to persuade the Home Office that the figures they were using as evidence were bogus,\u201d said the Lib Dem leader, Vince Cable, who was part of the coalition under David Cameron. \u201cBut they persisted nonetheless on the basis of these phoney numbers.\u201d </p> <p>Conservatives are also among those calling for targeting of foreign students and the higher education sector to end, believing it has twisted government policy and led the Home Office to persecute a valuable part of the economy. The Tory MP and former minister Bob Neill said: \u201cThere is a recognition that post-Brexit our education sector, our higher education sector, is a big selling point.\u201d Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury select committee, said the data suggested \u201cthe reasons given for including students in the net migration numbers don\u2019t really ring true\u201d.</p> <p>The data from the ONS also shows net migration has fallen to its lowest level for three years, partly driven by a \u201cBrexodus\u201d of EU workers. Departure of EU citizens increased by 33,000 year on year to 122,000 \u2013 the highest outflow for nearly a decade. The latest yearly migration figure stands at 246,000, which is 81,000 lower than the 327,000 recorded up to March 2016. </p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Make way for robo-trucks \u2013 </strong>Automated lorries travelling in tight \u201cplatoons\u201d have been given the go-ahead for trials on UK roads. But motoring bodies fear the concept \u2013 where a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/aug/25/semi-automated-truck-convoy-trials-get-uk-go-ahead-platooning\">lead truck controls the steering, acceleration and brakes</a> of two following directly behind \u2013 could be a danger and a nuisance for ordinary motorists, obscuring road signs and blocking exits. \u201cA three-truck platoon is longer than half a Premier League football pitch,\u201d said Edmund King, the AA president. All the trucks have drivers on board ready to take control; roads authorities and the Transport Research Laboratory say the system aims to improve safety, fuel efficiency and reduce pollution.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>All around the houses \u2013 </strong>It is hard to report UK housing figures without adding to a confusing and sometimes contradictory picture of the market \u2013 and sentiments differ depending on whether you are trying to buy or sell. The general slowdown in property sales and price growth has been well covered, especially in London. So make what you will of what Hometrack has got to say this month: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/aug/25/slowdown-in-london-house-price-growth-ebbs-as-bristol-sees-steep-fall\">prices might be starting to grow more strongly in the capital</a>, but it\u2019s partly because owners are refusing to sell for less than they want, and growth is still much slower than a year ago. In Bristol there has been a dramatic slump in growth. Our financial editor, Nils Pratley, wrote recently that it\u2019s best to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/07/house-price-slowdown-estate-agents-rises-uk-wages\">ignore a modest monthly pick-up</a> and look at the longer-term trend \u2013 and with wage growth so weak, a brake on house prices is good news for those struggling to buy. <br></p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Warrant for Thai ex-PM \u2013 </strong>An arrest warrant has been issued for Thailand\u2019s deposed prime minister, Yingluck Shinawatra, after she failed to appear in court. Shinawatra was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/25/arrest-warrant-issued-for-former-thai-pm-yingluck-after-no-show-in-court\">due to hear the verdict in her trial</a> on charges that she failed to prevent abuse of a rice subsidies scheme. Yingluck and her brother, Thaksin, have both been deposed from the prime ministership by the army after winning elections. The Shinawatra family has huge support among Thailand\u2019s rural poor but is disliked by the royalist and military elite.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Not so welcome to Canada \u2013 </strong>After Donald Trump took office in the US promising a crackdown on immigrants, Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, tweeted a \u201cWelcome to Canada\u201d message to refugees. But since the start of the year more than 11,300 people have crossed into Canada by foot at unguarded parts of the border, and in recent weeks there have been as many as 250 a day. Montreal\u2019s Olympic stadium has had to become a temporary processing centre, while the army is setting up a 500-person camp at the border and a tent city in Ontario. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/25/justin-trudeau-forced-to-backtrack-on-open-invitation-to-refugees\">\u201cOur system now is in shambles,\u201d</a> said Conservative immigration critic Michelle Rempel, who blamed \u201cthe inconsistent messaging \u2026 that has been coming out of Justin Trudeau\u2019s personal communication shop\u201d for giving migrants false hope.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Game over for now \u2013 </strong>Spoiler alert: do not read this one unless you are up to date on Games of Thrones.

          "bodyText": "Top story: Mass overstaying of study visas exploded as myth Hello \u2013 it\u2019s Warren Murray helping you sound well informed at the water cooler today. Theresa May has been left embarrassed and isolated as immigration figures prove foreign students constitute a much smaller risk of overstaying their visas than the government has contended. It puts the prime minister under increased pressure to exclude students from the perennially unachieved Conservative pledge to bring immigration down to the \u201ctens of thousands\u201d. The Home Office previously estimated there were 100,000 students a year staying on illegally \u2013 but new data from the Office of National Statistics says there were only 4,600 last year. \u201cWe spent five years trying to persuade the Home Office that the figures they were using as evidence were bogus,\u201d said the Lib Dem leader, Vince Cable, who was part of the coalition under David Cameron. \u201cBut they persisted nonetheless on the basis of these phoney numbers.\u201d Conservatives are also among those calling for targeting of foreign students and the higher education sector to end, believing it has twisted government policy and led the Home Office to persecute a valuable part of the economy. The Tory MP and former minister Bob Neill said: \u201cThere is a recognition that post-Brexit our education sector, our higher education sector, is a big selling point.\u201d Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury select committee, said the data suggested \u201cthe reasons given for including students in the net migration numbers don\u2019t really ring true\u201d. The data from the ONS also shows net migration has fallen to its lowest level for three years, partly driven by a \u201cBrexodus\u201d of EU workers. Departure of EU citizens increased by 33,000 year on year to 122,000 \u2013 the highest outflow for nearly a decade. The latest yearly migration figure stands at 246,000, which is 81,000 lower than the 327,000 recorded up to March 2016. * * * Make way for robo-trucks \u2013 Automated lorries travelling in tight \u201cplatoons\u201d have been given the go-ahead for trials on UK roads. But motoring bodies fear the concept \u2013 where a lead truck controls the steering, acceleration and brakes of two following directly behind \u2013 could be a danger and a nuisance for ordinary motorists, obscuring road signs and blocking exits. \u201cA three-truck platoon is longer than half a Premier League football pitch,\u201d said Edmund King, the AA president. All the trucks have drivers on board ready to take control; roads authorities and the Transport Research Laboratory say the system aims to improve safety, fuel efficiency and reduce pollution. * * * All around the houses \u2013 It is hard to report UK housing figures without adding to a confusing and sometimes contradictory picture of the market \u2013 and sentiments differ depending on whether you are trying to buy or sell. The general slowdown in property sales and price growth has been well covered, especially in London. So make what you will of what Hometrack has got to say this month: prices might be starting to grow more strongly in the capital, but it\u2019s partly because owners are refusing to sell for less than they want, and growth is still much slower than a year ago. In Bristol there has been a dramatic slump in growth. Our financial editor, Nils Pratley, wrote recently that it\u2019s best to ignore a modest monthly pick-up and look at the longer-term trend \u2013 and with wage growth so weak, a brake on house prices is good news for those struggling to buy. * * * Warrant for Thai ex-PM \u2013 An arrest warrant has been issued for Thailand\u2019s deposed prime minister, Yingluck Shinawatra, after she failed to appear in court. Shinawatra was due to hear the verdict in her trial on charges that she failed to prevent abuse of a rice subsidies scheme. Yingluck and her brother, Thaksin, have both been deposed from the prime ministership by the army after winning elections. The Shinawatra family has huge support among Thailand\u2019s rural poor but is disliked by the royalist and military elite. * * * Not so welcome to Canada \u2013 After Donald Trump took office in the US promising a crackdown on immigrants, Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, tweeted a \u201cWelcome to Canada\u201d message to refugees. But since the start of the year more than 11,300 people have crossed into Canada by foot at unguarded parts of the border, and in recent weeks there have been as many as 250 a day. Montreal\u2019s Olympic stadium has had to become a temporary processing centre, while the army is setting up a 500-person camp at the border and a tent city in Ontario. \u201cOur system now is in shambles,\u201d said Conservative immigration critic Michelle Rempel, who blamed \u201cthe inconsistent messaging \u2026 that has been coming out of Justin Trudeau\u2019s personal communication shop\u201d for giving migrants false hope. * * * Game over for now \u2013 Spoiler alert: do not read this one unless you are up to date on Games of Thrones. We have gathered some readers\u2019 predictions of how season seven will end. Is there an all-knowing Three-Eyed Raven among our contributors? Click through, read the suggestions \u2013 and then compare with what happens on Monday. Lunchtime read: Cuts that could kill E coli bacteria on the salad leaves, hepatitis in supermarket pork, eggs containing banned pesticides \u2013 this has been a summer of food scares. We are invariably reassured afterwards that all is well, our food is safe and the system that protects us is working. But that system is being slowly dismantled, writes Felicity Lawrence, as cash-strapped local authorities lack the funding for food industry inspections, and the government presses on with a deregulation agenda that will let manufacturers oversee themselves. Have we forgotten already about how they sold us horsemeat burgers? Sport The England manager, Gareth Southgate, has said there is still a possibility he might invite Wayne Rooney out of international retirement for next year\u2019s World Cup. Liverpool, Manchester City and Manchester United all look likely to reach the last 16 of the Champions League but Tottenham have been dealt a harsh hand after being drawn with favourites Real Madrid. Gylfi Sigurdsson delivered the first downpayment on his transfer fee with an abracadabra goal that helped secure Everton\u2019s place in Friday\u2019s Europa League draw with a 1-1 draw at Hajduk Split. The FA\u2019s attempts to repair any damage to Mark Sampson\u2019s reputation will involve consulting with senior internationals from the England women\u2019s team to identify the players who might be willing to speak on the head coach\u2019s behalf before their next game. And Rory McIlroy has work to do after struggling to a three-over-par opening round of 73 at the Northern Trust Open in New York. Business Britain\u2019s top companies could be forced to disclose the gap between executive and rank and file pay as Theresa May tries to reset her domestic agenda. Her government\u2019s plan to phase out petrol and diesel cars by 2040 could halve oil imports by 2030, according to a study by green groups. On the Asian markets, stocks rose modestly while the pound was up fractionally at $1.281 and \u20ac1.085. The FTSE 100 is set to dip 0.1% at the open.

          "bodyText": "A 22-year-old Moroccan national is at the centre of the Spanish police\u2019s search for the driver of the van used in the Barcelona attack. Younes Abouyaaqoub is understood to be the chief suspect for the attack on Las Ramblas that killed at least 13 and injured more than 130. According to the Spanish newspaper El Pa\u00eds, police in Catalonia said they were searching for the man, who is thought to be a key member of a 12-strong jihadist cell responsible for the attacks. On Friday it emerged that another suspect, Moussa Oukabir, who is thought to have rented the van, was among five men shot dead as they launched a second attack in the coastal town of Cambrils. The teenager, said to be 17 or 18 years old, is suspected of using his brother\u2019s documents to hire the vehicle that ploughed through pedestrians in the Barcelona tourist hotspot on Thursday evening. He reportedly died along with Said Aallaa, 19, and Mohamed Hychami, 24, who were part of a group that mounted a similar attack in Cambrils that left one woman dead and six people injured. The identities of the other two dead jihadists are yet to be confirmed by police. Four men, aged 21, 27, 28 and 34, who were arrested in connection with the attack, remain in custody. Three are Moroccan and one is Spanish. Police said none of them were previously known to the security services for terror-related reasons. Moussa Oukabir\u2019s older brother, Driss Oukabir, is reported to be one of those detained. Several of those suspected of involvement in the attacks are thought to come from Ripoll, an inland town of 10,000 people about 60 miles (100km) north-west of Barcelona. Police on Friday searched the apartment of the town\u2019s imam, neighbours said. An apparent search warrant seen by the Associated Press authorised police to extract any terrorism-related \u201cweapons, ammunition, explosives, instruments, documents or papers\u201d found in the apartment. Despite fears that Abouyaaqoub is still at large, Spain on Saturday decided to maintain its terrorist threat alert at level four, the second-highest level, declaring that no new attacks were imminent. The interior minister, Juan Ignacio Zoido, said the country would nevertheless reinforce security for events that draw large crowds and popular tourist sites. \u201cWe are going to redirect our efforts and will adapt these to every place or area that needs special protection,\u201d Zoido told a news conference, adding that Spanish authorities considered the cell behind the attacks had been fully dismantled. About 34 nationalities were among almost 130 people wounded in the attacks in Las Ramblas and in Cambrils, which lies around 70 miles (110km) to the south-west. Thirteen of the 14 victims have been identified, although not all have been named. Five were Spanish, three were German, two were Italian, with one from the United States, Belgium and Portugal respectively. Authorities said 54 people injured in the attacks were still in hospital on Friday night, with 12 in a critical condition and 25 in a serious condition. Relatives of a seven-year-old who became separated from his mother during the Barcelona attack are continuing to appeal for information. The father and grandmother of Julian Alessandro Cadman are travelling to Spain from Australia as the wait for news continues, family member Debbie Cadman said. Speaking after the family\u2019s initial plea for help, the prime minister, Theresa May, said a child with dual British nationality was believed to be among those unaccounted for. Four Australians were injured in the attack, the country\u2019s foreign minister, Julie Bishop, said. Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said one Canadian was killed and four injured during the attacks. Police have revealed that the terrorists behind the rampage were preparing bigger attacks, with an explosion on Wednesday at a house in Alcanar believed to have robbed the killers of materials to use in larger-scale operations. Reports from Spain had earlier suggested the terror cell may have been planning an attack using gas canisters. Police are also looking for a white Renault Kangoo vehicle which is believed to have been rented by the suspects and could have crossed the border into France, according to French media. The attacks in Barcelona and Cambrils took place around eight hours apart on Thursday afternoon and in the early hours of Friday. In an echo of the London Bridge attack in June, Catalonia president Carles Puigdemont said the five terrorists in the Cambrils car were wearing fake suicide belts when they were stopped. Police revealed that an axe and knives were also found in the vehicle, with one of the latter used to wound one person in the face before the terrorists were gunned down. Ben Wallace, the UK security minister, said the terror threat to Britain was rising as Islamic State loses battles and territory in Syria and Iraq. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cI think the threat is still increasing, partly driven by the fact Isis is collapsing in Syria and people are either unable to get out there to fight for Isis and so they look to do something at home, or also because people have come back and tried to inspire people with their stories and tales of the caliphate. I think those two things mean that the threat is to some extent increasing.\u201d Wallace rejected suggestions that the government\u2019s voluntary anti-radicalisation programme, Prevent, could be made compulsory. Simon Cole, the police lead for Prevent, had recently said that a debate was needed about introducing an element of compulsion for certain groups, such as returnees from Syria. Meanwhile police in Finland have said a stabbing in the city of Turku on Friday was being investigated as murder with possible terrorist intent.",

Now, we will shortly release the first national strategy for protecting crowded places from terrorism. It has been completed. This is a good example of the approach that I take to keeping Australians safe. </p> \n   <p>You may recall that last year there was a truck attack, a vehicle attack, in Nice. A shocking attack and many people were killed and many more injured. </p> \n   <p>Clearly, this was going to be a new approach by terrorists. Vehicles are very easy to acquire. It is not really possible to stop people getting hold of a truck or even a car.

Several members escaped the dragnet and went on to launch an improvised operation. Rafaello Pantucci, an expert on Islamic militancy at Royal United Services Institute think-tank, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There\u2019s always an anxiety after a disruption if it\u2019s unclear whether [the authorities] have got the entire cell or network, and what the reaction of any missing members might be.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Some militants, such as the Barcelona attackers, respond by rushing to execute new plans. Others go to ground. Mohammed Sadiq Khan, who led the 7/7 attackers in London in 2005 suspected he had been identified as a potential threat by MI5 owing to his peripheral involvement with a network responsible for an earlier abortive operation. Khan kept a low-profile for several months, before emerging to lead his own attack.</p> \n  <p>Though Spain had escaped an Islamist militant terrorist attack since 2004, the country has long been among those in Europe which are seen as facing an elevated threat. Its counter-terrorist services are broadly respected by counterparts across the continent and in the US. They routinely co-operate with North African services, particularly those of Morocco.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-08-18T15:45:08.373Z\">at 4.45pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5997032ae4b06141db08ef54\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-08-18T15:10:34.080Z\">4.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Thursday\u2019s horrific attack doesn\u2019t just sadden me but feels like a personal assault.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Read Harry Eyres\u2019 love letter to Barcelona and, more specifically, Las Ramblas.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/18/barcelona-las-ramblas-seen-tragedy-before-flourish-again\">Barcelona\u2019s Las Ramblas has seen tragedy before \u2026 and will flourish again | Harry Eyres</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5996feb6e4b0f635ef94a5fb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-08-18T14:51:39.083Z\">3.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Queen has sent a message of condolence to the king and people of Spain.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It is deeply upsetting when innocent people are put at risk in this way when going about their daily lives.</p> \n   <p>Our thoughts and prayers are with those who have lost loved ones and the people who are recovering in hospital.

There is a very extensive and entrenched Salafist community in Catalonia.</p> \n   <p>It\u2019s not really in Barcelona. It\u2019s really in the rural areas and the coastal areas. It\u2019s almost exclusively Moroccan and started about 20 years ago with a lot of self-styled sheikhs. Keep in mind it\u2019s a very rural migrant population living in poverty, it\u2019s uneducated and a lot of people work in agriculture. You have these Salafist mosques which have traditionally received quite a lot of funding from the Gulf \u2013 the usual suspects, the Saudis, Qatar and particularly Kuwait.</p> \n   <p>The community organises very large gatherings during the Christmas and Easter holidays, because it is the gateway for migrants who live in continental Europe. If you are a Moroccan living in Holland or France or Germany, you can fly back home, but a lot of people drive. If you drive from Brussels or Paris, you drive through Catalonia. It\u2019s a very logical of way of going.</p> \n   <p>So they do these very large gatherings, so you will see in small towns, say of 10,000 people, gatherings on Christmas Day of five or six thousand people and only a few are Moroccans from Catalonia. The speakers are big sheikhs from Saudi, from Kuwait, from other European countries. So that\u2019s a very big scene there.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Vidino stressed the distinction between Salafism and radicalisation and support for violence.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There are different currents. There are currents there that are very conservative but not necessarily supporting violence. Having said that, it\u2019s undeniable that that environment has created a milieu that is fertile for further radicalisation. It explains why there is more radicalisation than any other part of mainland Spain.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>However, radicalisation is measured by the number of foreign fighters going to Syria or Iraq. There is less of a problem in Spain that in northern European countries. Vidino said about 200 had gone from Spain, a quarter of those who have travelled from the UK and less than one seventh of the number of French foreign fighters.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-08-18T15:00:42.985Z\">at 4.00pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5996fa8be4b0f635ef94a5e0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-08-18T14:34:03.162Z\">3.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Further to the American who died in Spain, the US State Department says at least one more suffered a minor wound.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5996f879e4b06141db08ef1a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/samjones\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-08-18T14:27:25.442Z\">3.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Details have begun to emerge of how one Catalan police officer shot dead four of the five attackers who tried to run people down in the coastal town of Cambrils in the early hours of Friday morning.</p> \n  <p>Police chief Josep Lluis Trapero, who is leading the investigation into the attacks, told a press conference on Friday afternoon that one officer had managed to kill all but one of the attackers.</p> \n  <p>He said that it was \u201cnot easy\u201d for the officer involved despite being a professional.</p> \n  <p>According to the Barcelona-based paper La Vanguardia, a team of Mossos d\u2019Esquadra was stationed at a police checkpoint near the roundabout outside the Club Nautic restaurant when the attackers\u2019 Audi A3 ran down three people before smashing into the police car.</p> \n  <p>Seeing a colleague injured in the crash and noticing the terrorists emerging from their car with knives, machetes and axes, the officer raised his rifle and shot four of them dead.</p> \n  <p>The fifth attacker managed to escape and stab a pedestrian in the face before he was shot by another officer with a submachinegun.</p> \n  <p>According to La Vanguardia, the officer who shot the four attackers had been due to go on holiday this week.

          "bodyText": "We are closing off our live coverage of the aftermath of terrorist attacks in Spain which have left 14 people dead and more than 100 people injured. Islamic State have claimed responsibility for the twin attacks in Barcelona and the coastal town of Cambrils, 120km away, though their involvement has not been verified. Police believe an earlier house explosion in Alcanar, 200km from Barcelona, is linked to the attacks. A vehicle ploughed into a crowd of pedestrians on the famous Las Ramblas boulevard in Barcelona, killing and injuring people and leading to scenes of chaos and panic. Some eight hours after the Barcelona attack, an Audi A3 car hit pedestrians in the resort town of Cambrils, 120 kilometres to the south. Police shot dead five suspects in the vehicle: Moussa Oukabir, 17, El Houssaine Abouyaaqoub, 19, Said Aallaa, 19, Omar Hychami, 21, and Mohamed Hychami, 24. Police initially believed that one of the five men killed was the driver responsible for the earlier attack in Barcelona, who fled the scene. But police chief Josep Lluis Trapero said he could not confirm the Barcelona driver was one of five men killed and that this theory was losing strength. Police said in total seven suspects had been killed and four more arrested. A search is underway for suspect Younes Abouyaaqoub, and British agencies are assisting in an international manhunt for the 22 year-old. Julian Cadman, a seven year-old with dual Australian and British nationality, is still missing after being separated from his mother when she was injured in the Barcelona. Among the dead and injured are people from 34 countries including France, Pakistan, Spain, the Netherlands, China, Venezuela, Mauritania, Australia, Britain and the United States. Vehicle attacks are unfolding as a \u201cnew approach to terrorism\u201d, Australia\u2019s prime minister Malcolm Turnbull has just told the Tasmanian State Liberal Conference. He called on people to pray for seven-year-old Australian boy Julian Cadman, who has been missing in Barcelona after being separated from his mother during the Barcelona attacks: In this attack we have seen Australians injured and there is a little Australian boy whose mother was badly injured and is in hospital and he is lost. He is missing in Barcelona. So, I think we should all in a our quiet moments say a prayer for that little boy. All of us as parents know the anguish his father is going through and his whole family is going through, as they rush to seek to find him in Barcelona. Now, we are not immune from terrorist threats here in Australia. Only a few weeks ago our security services and intelligence services, police in New South Wales disrupted the most significant terrorist plot we have seen to blowup an aeroplane. It would have resulted, if these plotters had been able to carry out their intentions... in hundreds of deaths. There is no place for \u2018set and forget\u2019 in the battle against terrorism. Now, we will shortly release the first national strategy for protecting crowded places from terrorism. It has been completed. This is a good example of the approach that I take to keeping Australians safe. You may recall that last year there was a truck attack, a vehicle attack, in Nice. A shocking attack and many people were killed and many more injured. Clearly, this was going to be a new approach by terrorists. Vehicles are very easy to acquire. It is not really possible to stop people getting hold of a truck or even a car. As you have seen in London, relatively light vehicles can do enormous damage. He is expected to reveal further details of the national strategy on Sunday. Australia\u2019s prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, will on Sunday announce a plan to secure high-traffic pedestrian areas from vehicle attacks such as that committed in Barcelona and other major European centres. According to The Australian newspaper, Turnbull will unveil a counter-terrorism strategy document that will provide the most comprehensive advice yet on how businesses can mitigate against the threat of terrorist attack. The Aus reports: The release of the document, the subject of ongoing collaboration between the federal government and the states, as well as representatives from the private sector, comes after Islamic State-inspired terrorists killed 14 people and wounded about 100 in co-ordinated vehicle attacks across Spain. It rests on the assumption that not every public space can be protected and the burden for defending the public must be shared between police, local councils, state governments and private operators. It guides businesses as well as councils and the operators of private spaces, such as sports grounds, on how to assess their risk to hostile vehicle attack. It offers basic advice on how to counter such assaults, such as by installing bollards or reconfiguring the line of approach to a venue by installing chicanes or angled approaches that prevent vehicles from gaining speed. Meanwhile on Friday night, the father of a seven-year-old boy missing in the attack aftermath made his way to Spain from Australia to help in the search for his son and to be with his wife. Julian Cadman is missing in Barcelona after Friday morning\u2019s terror attacks, his family say. Jom Cadman, Julian\u2019s mother, was found in hospital and is in a serious but stable condition. She and Julian were visiting Barcelona for a wedding when they were caught up in the attack. The driver of the van may still be alive and at large, Reuters reports. Spanish police have apparently denied earlier media reports that he had been shot dead in a Catalan seaside resort. Police chief in Spain\u2019s northeastern region of Catalonia, Josep Lluis Trapero, said he could not confirm the driver was one of five men killed. \u201cIt is still a possibility but, unlike four hours ago, it is losing weight,\u201d he told regional TV. The driver abandoned the van and fled on Thursday after speeding along a section of Las Ramblas, the most famous boulevard in Barcelona, leaving a trail of dead and injured among the crowds of tourists and local residents. The death toll of the attacks in Spain stands at 14 people. Those named so far are: Jared Tucker, 42; Ana Maria Suarez; Pipita Codina, 75; Bruno Gulotta, 35; Luca Russo, 25; Elke Vanbockrijck, 44; and Francisco L\u00f3pez Rodr\u00edguez, 60. There were 130 people injured from at least 34 countries and 17 of them are in a critical condition. Four people have been arrested, none of whom had previous links to terrorism, and Spanish police are searching for three more men. Five men have been shot and killed by the police after a second attack in Cambrils. Moussa Oukabir, the 17-year-old initially reported to be the driver of the van which ploughed into pedestrians on Las Ramblas, was among those killed, and police now suspect the actual driver is still at large. The UK Foreign Office confirmed that it was helping a \u201csmall number\u201d of British citizens and the prime minister said a child with dual British-Australian nationality is among the missing. His family have named him as Julian Cadman and issued online appeals for help in finding him. Here is what we know about the related terrorist attacks that took place on Thursday and Friday: Barcelona A man drove a van into pedestrians in Las Ramblas, killing 13 people and injuring 100. Spanish police are hunting for three men in connection with the attack, one of whom has been named as Younes Abouyaaqoub, 22, who is thought to have driven the van. A minute\u2019s silence was held in Barcelona\u2019s main square, followed by several minutes of applause. Spain\u2019s King Felipe and its prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, attended. A minute\u2019s silence was also held at the EU buildings in Brussels. A seven-year-old British-Australian boy, Julian Cadman, became separated from his mother, who is in a serious but stable condition in hospital. Authorities say the subsequent attack in Cambrils is linked to the terrorist assault on Barcelona. Four suspects arrested on Thursday are being held on suspicion of links to the Barcelona attack, but police say none of them was the driver. A second van that was believed to have been used as a getaway vehicle for the Barcelona attacker was found abandoned in Vic, 50 miles (80km) away. The Spanish police are reportedly also searching for a white Renault Kangoo van which was rented by the Barcelona suspects on Thursday and may have crossed the border into France following the attack. Isis has claimed responsibility for the attack in Las Ramblas, but this could not be verified. Cambrils A second terrorist attack took place in Cambrils, a coastal town around 120km from Barcelona, in the early hours of Friday. One person was killed and five bystanders and one police officer were injured \u2013 two seriously \u2013 when they were reported to have been deliberately hit by a car. The attackers were wearing fake suicide vests, according to Catalan officials cited by El Pais. Police officers shot dead five suspects, some of whom were wearing what appeared to be explosive belts. A single police officer was responsible for killing four of the attackers after his partner was injured. The five dead attackers were Moussa Oukabir, 17, El Houssaine Abouyaaqoub, 19, Said Aallaa, 19, Omar Hychami, 21, and Mohamed Hychami, 24. The Audi A3 used in the Cambrils attack was removed by police. Its back window was smashed and it was upside down. Javier Zaragoza, the head of the Audiencia Nacional, the court that deals with terror offences, said on Friday that those killed had no known links to jihadism. Alcanar Officials are also linking the two attacks to an earlier explosion that destroyed a house in Alcanar, killing two people and wounding at least one more. Police now say they believe explosives were being prepared at the property, and were intended to be used in a terrorist attack. Alcanar is about 200km (124 miles) from Barcelona and 90km (56 miles) from Cambrils. Investigators are picking through the remains of the building where the explosion took place and are trying to ascertain if the two people who died in the blast were among the three suspects still at large. Catalan police have confirmed media reports from earlier in the day, and named some of the suspects in the attacks. The five shot dead in Cambrils included Moussa Oukabir, 17, (who has elsewhere been reported to be 18), who had initially been sought as the driver in the Ramblas attack.El Houssaine Abouyaaqoub, 19, and Said Aallaa, 19, were also killed. All three were Moroccan. The other two killed, Omar Hychami, 21, and Mohamed Hychami, 24, were listed as born in Morocco. Police are still hunting Younes Abouyaaqoub, 22, who they now suspect may have been the van driver in Barcelona, along with two other unnamed suspects who are still on the run. In total, 12 people are suspected of involvement in the wave of attacks in Catalonia, police chief Josep Lluis Trapero said in a TV interview. Five were killed in Cambrils and a further four have been arrested. The remains of two people have been recovered from the house in Alcanar which was largely destroyed in an explosion and detectives are currently trying to ascertain if they are any of the three other suspects. Donald Trump has spoken to the Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy on the phone, and assured him of the United States\u2019s full support in investigating the attacks. A White House statement said that the president pledged his country\u2019s backing to the Spanish authorities as they seek to bring the perpetrators to justice. He also offered his condolences to the victims and their families. Justin Trudeau, Canada\u2019s prime minister, has confirmed that attack in Las Ramblas claimed the life of one Canadian and injured four others. It was with great sadness that I learned today that one Canadian was killed and four others injured during yesterday\u2019s cowardly terrorist attack in Barcelona. We join Spain and countries around the world in grieving the senseless loss of so many innocent people. We must stand firm against the spread of hate and intolerance in all its forms. These violent acts that seek to divide us will only strengthen our resolve.\u201d The British government has released more information on what steps it has been taking to protect pedestrians from vehicle attacks. A spokesman said that the Department for Transport was \u201cworking with the police and the vehicle rental industry to explore what more can be done to prevent the malicious use of hire vehicles\u201d. Following the two attacks in London on Westminster Bridge in March and London Bridge in June, large steel or concrete barriers were placed along each of the capital\u2019s major bridges to stop cars from being able to mount the pavement. The spokesman also said: We have also been working to improve protection in public spaces, including increased physical security measures at locations such as bridges and city centres, and will continue to explore every option. At the same time, people should not be afraid to go about their daily lives. We ask that people remain alert but not alarmed and report anything suspicious to the police. Some more of the victims of the Las Ramblas attack have been named. Pepita Codina, 75, from the small town of Hipolit de Voldrega, near Barcelona. Her identity has not yet been formally confirmed, but the mayor of her hometown has said on social media that she was among those killed. Ana Maria Suarez. She was the sole victim of the Cambrils attack in the early hours of Friday morning, according to the Spanish Royal Family\u2019s Twitter account. Jared Tucker, 42, from California. His death was confirmed by his father to the New York Daily News. He was visiting Barcelona with his wife to celebrate their first wedding anniversary. There are at least 34 nationalities represented among the victims of the attacks, the Catalan authorities have said; a picture of the enduring appeal of Barcelona and its most famous street \u2013 Las Ramblas \u2013 to tourists from all over the world. The seven-year-old Australian boy who is believed to be missing following the attack, named by his family as Julian Cadman, is also thought to be a dual British national. He was visiting Barcelona with his mother but became separated in the chaos on Las Ramblas and has not been seen since. Julian\u2019s parents are travelling to Spain from Australia, and his grandfather has urged people to share an image of the boy on Facebook: My grandson, Julian Alessandro Cadman is missing. Please like and share. We have found Jom (my daughter in law) and she is (in a) serious but stable condition in hospital. Julian is seven years old and was out with Jom when they were separated, due to the recent terrorist activity. Please share if you have family or friends in Barcelona. Earlier on Friday, Theresa May said that the British authorities were \u201curgently looking into reports\u201d that a dual-national British child was missing. The Australian foreign minister, Julie Bishop, has also told reporters that one Australian citizen remains unaccounted for. One more victim of the Las Ramblas attack has been named: Jared Tucker, from California. His father, Daniel Tucker, told the New York Daily News his son\u2019s wife had identified his body in a Barcelona morgue. The couple were visiting the city to celebrate their first wedding anniversary. A second American citizen has been confirmed as a casualty, suffering minor injuries in the incident, the US State Department has said. An official with Spain\u2019s police union has backed up earlier reports that the teenager suspected of driving the van into crowds of pedestrians on Las Ramblas was shot dead by police during the shootout in Cambrils on Friday morning. Spanish media reported earlier on Friday that Moussa Oukabir, 18, was among the five men killed by officers after a second vehicle attack. Now, a union official has told AP colleagues in the Civil Guard police force confirmed to him Oukabir was killed in the Cambrils incident. Investigators believe Oukabir was behind the wheel of the van which ploughed into tourists in Barcelona\u2019s city centre on Thursday, killing at least 13 and injuring 100. Barcelona footballers will wear a tribute to the victims of the terror attacks on their shirts for their next match. The club have secured the approval of the Spanish football authorities to have the message #TotsSomBarcelona (We are all Barcelona) embroidered on their jerseys for their game against Real Betis on Sunday. The players will also wear black armbands. All 40 sides in Spain\u2019s top two football divisions are set to also hold a minute\u2019s silence before their matches kick off over the weekend. The Spanish police are reportedly searching for a white Renault Kangoo van which was rented by the Barcelona suspects on Thursday. French security sources told the AP news agency that the four men being sought by the police may have crossed the border into France in the vehicle. France\u2019s interior minister, G\u00e9rard Collomb, earlier said that surveillance on the usually open border between his country and Spain had been heightened following the terror attacks across Catalonia. The death toll of the attacks in Spain stands at 14 people. Those named so far are: Bruno Gulotta, 35; Luca Russo, 25; Elke Vanbockrijck, 44; and Francisco L\u00f3pez Rodr\u00edguez, 60. There were 130 people injured from at least 34 countries and 17 of them are in a critical condition. Four people have been arrested, none of whom had previous links to terrorism, and Spanish police are searching for four more men. They have been unable to confirm reports that the driver of the van used in the Barcelona attack was killed in the later atrocity in Cambrils. The UK Foreign Office confirmed that it was helping a \u201csmall number\u201d of British citizens and the prime minister said a child with British nationality is among the missing. Here is what we know about the related terrorist attacks that took place on Thursday and Friday: Barcelona A man drove a van into pedestrians in Las Ramblas, killing 13 people and injuring 100. Spanish police are hunting four men, including Moussa Oukabir, the teenager who is suspected of being the driver of the van. A minute\u2019s silence was held in Barcelona\u2019s main square, followed by several minutes of applause. Spain\u2019s King Felipe and its prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, attended. A minute\u2019s silence was also held at the EU buildings in Brussels. A seven-year-old Australian boy, Julian Cadman, became separated from his mother, who is in a serious but stable condition in hospital. Authorities say the subsequent attack in Cambrils is linked to the terrorist assault on Barcelona. Four suspects arrested on Thursday are being held on suspicion of links to the Barcelona attack, but police say none of them was the driver. A second van that was believed to have been used as a getaway vehicle for the Barcelona attacker was found abandoned in Vic, 50 miles (80km) away. Isis has claimed responsibility for the attack in Las Ramblas, but this could not be verified. Cambrils A second terrorist attack took place in Cambrils, a coastal town around 120km from Barcelona, in the early hours of Friday. One person was killed and five bystanders and one police officer were injured \u2013 two seriously \u2013 when they were reported to have been deliberately hit by a car. The attackers were wearing fake suicide vests, according to Catalan officials cited by El Pais. Police officers shot dead five suspects, some of whom were wearing what appeared to be explosive belts. A single police officer was responsible for killing four of the attackers after his partner was injured. The Audi A3 used in the Cambrils attack was removed by police. Its back window was smashed and it was upside down. Javier Zaragoza, the head of the Audiencia Nacional, the court that deals with terror offences, said on Friday that those killed had no known links to jihadism. Alcanar Officials are also linking the two attacks to an earlier explosion that destroyed a house in Alcanar, killing one person and wounding at least one more. Police now say they believe explosives were being prepared at the property. Alcanar is about 200km (124 miles) from Barcelona and 90km (56 miles) from Cambrils. Investigators are picking through the remains of the building where the explosion took place. You can read the full report here: All that remains of the holiday house that used to sit on a bumpy track overlooking the Mediterranean Sea at Alcanar, 100 miles south of Barcelona, is a pile of colourful rubble. Police now suspect this was the bomb-making factory where those who carried out the terrorist attacks in Barcelona and Cambrils on Thursday and Friday were trying to build a potent explosive device. This appears to have exploded prematurely at the house late on Wednesday night, killing one person. The explosion rained fist-sized chunks of masonry down on to the swimming pool and garden terrace of the Hostal Montecarlo 100 metres away, while bits of human flesh landed in neighbouring gardens. \u201cIt rocked everything and smashed some of our windows too,\u201d said Cristina Bolz, whose family owns the hostel. One body has been recovered from the debris so far and a man who was taken to hospital with injuries has been arrested after police linked the explosion here to the attacks in Barcelona on Thursday afternoon and Cambrils in the early hours of Friday. On Friday afternoon, police continued to search through the rubble, looking for more bodies and clues that might help them identify other members of the group. They suspect that the men who met here wanted to fill a van with butane bottles and then blow it up. An ambulance pulled up at the site late on Friday afternoon, but it was not clear whether it was there to take another body away or as a precaution because police were planning to carry out a series of controlled explosions. The house, which had been repossessed by a bank years ago, was being squatted by a group of men who neighbours assumed were Moroccan and who came and went on powerful Kawasaki motorbikes. Police thought this meant it had been a drugs factory of some kind and initially treated the explosion as an accident. More than a dozen orange-coloured butane gas bottles were found in the rubble and Eric Groby, the next door neighbour who was first to arrive at the scene, noticed gas immediately. \u201cThere was a hissing sound of gas escaping from somewhere and it also smelt,\u201d the Frenchman said on Friday as he waited to be allowed back to his house after the area had been cordoned off by police and fire fighters. The force of the explosion was so strong that it had broken the plate Groby was holding in his hands, and a lump of rubble flew into his face, leaving him with a black eye. Patrick Vinaros, another neighbour in this estate of mostly simple houses built in an unfashionable stretch of the Catalan coast, said the group of men who had been squatting the house for almost a year kept themselves to themselves. \u201cWe never spoke to them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey weren\u2019t unfriendly, but they made a lot of noise with their motorbikes.\u201d He said the men who frequented the house seemed to be Muslims, with some wearing long beards. Soon after one the main thoroughfares in their city became the scene of a terror attack, Barcelona residents responded with an outpouring of kindness, offering places to stay, free rides and translation services to anyone caught up in Thursday\u2019s attacks. Echoing initiatives launched after the attacks in France, Belgium and Manchester, hundreds of Barcelona residents invited people into their homes on Thursday tagging posts with #bedinbarcelona. Miguel Garc\u00eda Casado said he would be taking in a French couple and their two children who had been caught up in the attacks. \u201cWhat movie and special dinner should we make?\u201d Garc\u00eda Casado wrote on Twitter. The family were tourists who were staying in Pened\u00e8s, some 60 miles from Barcelona, but were stranded as their car was parked in a closed-off area of Pla\u00e7a de Catalunya. The night proved fun, he said. \u201cI\u2019m explaining to their youngest daughter what the monarchy is. I\u2019m dying of laughter,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIn the end, we had pizza and watched Hotel Transylvania 2,\u201d he added, sharing a picture of the group on Twitter. As news broke that more than 100 people had been injured in the Las Ramblas attack, dozens of the city\u2019s residents queued to donate blood. On Thursday, authorities said they had enough reserves to attend to all of the injured. Offers of help continued to pour in from Catalonia after police said they had expanded their operations to the coastal town of Cambrils. Some offered translation services or baby supplies while several taxi companies and ride services offered free drives to anyone who might be in need. Public transport officials announced there would be no charge for the metro or bus services in Barcelona and Tourism Barcelona said it was working with the hotel chain Gremi D\u2019Hotels to offer alternative hotel rooms to stranded tourists. At the Taller de Tapas restaurant \u2013 located metres from Thursday\u2019s deadly attack \u2013 dozens packed into the restaurant after fleeing Las Ramblas. Waiters handed out water and plates of the classic tapas dish patatas bravas, doing what they could to calm people. \u201cWe had people here from all over the world and I was trying my best to reassure them,\u201d employee Gurdeep Singh told La Vanguardia. Immediately after the attack, police had asked the restaurant to close its doors, said Singh. But after seeing people panicking and in tears on Las Ramblas, Singh said he began inviting people to take shelter in the restaurant. \u201cI left the door open and I was there for about six or seven hours. There were groups, kids, strollers \u2013 everything. I couldn\u2019t not let them in.\u201d Catalan police say they are still trying to identify the driver of the van used in the Barcelona attack, despite local media reports that he was among the five killed by officers during the later attack in Cambrils. Flights to Barcelona are operating normally and are expected to continue to do so over the coming days, British Airways, easyJet and Ryanair have said. BA said customers with tickets to or from Barcelona were being offered \u201ca range of options if they wish to bring forward or postpone their journey\u201d. However, those holding non-refundable tickets would face charges to change their flights. \u201cAnyone with concerns about their booking should contact us or their travel agent,\u201d the airline said. Travellers returning home early as a result of the attacks are unlikely to recoup the extra costs they incur. Being involved in such an attack is rare but most travel policies specifically exclude financial claims that arise as a result of a terrorist incident. It is the same for anyone who is due to fly out this weekend but who has decided not to travel. Those tourists in Barcelona who were forced to spend the night in alternative accommodation because police cordons prevented them returning to their hotels are also unlikely to be covered. EasyJet, which operates 32 flights a day between Barcelona and the UK, advised passengers to check the status of their flight on its site. The Foreign Office website warns that \u201cterrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Spain\u201d and that \u201cattacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners\u201d. It said that 12 million British people visited Spain last year and most visits were \u201ctrouble-free\u201d. Citizens from at least 34 countries, including France, Belgium, Germany, Venezuela, Australia, Ireland, Peru, Algeria and China, have been injured or killed, according to Catalan authorities. Here\u2019s what we know so far about those who died: The king of Morocco has expressed his condolences to Spain after the Barcelona attack, over which three Moroccans have been arrested. King Mohammed VI also condemned what he called an \u201codious criminal act, contrary to all human values and religious precepts\u201d. A statement carried by the state news agency MAP read: His Majesty the King expresses to King Felipe VI, and through him to all the families of victims and to the Spanish people, his sincere condolences and solidarity and compassion. Spanish police say they have arrested four people in connection with the attacks, three of them Moroccan and one from the Spanish enclave of Melilla on Morocco\u2019s northern coast. Three Moroccan nationals were among those injured during the attack and were being treated in a Barcelona hospital, according to MAP. At the suspected bomb factory in Alcanar, where it is thought the attack was planned, police are still digging through the rubble after an explosion. An ambulance also turned up. Neighbours talked of men on high-powered motor bikes going to and fro for almost a year. The explosion there rained rubble and body parts on to neighbours. The man who drove the van during the Barcelona terrorist attack was later shot dead during the further attack in Cambrils, according to local media reports. The reports were carried in Spain\u2019s El Pais and El Periodico newspapers. Catalan police had said earlier that it was possible the driver was among those killed in the second incident, though they could not be certain. A 26-year-old tourist from Australia who was caught up in Thursday\u2019s Las Ramblas attack has said it was the third terrorist attack she has experienced since she began travelling Europe almost three months ago. Julia Monaco ended up in lockdown in the London tube in June after a speeding van hit pedestrians on the London Bridge and attackers stabbed people with knives in cafes and restaurants at Borough market. Days later, she was in Paris when French police shot a man who attacked an officer with a hammer outside of the Notre Dame cathedral. She continued her travels, ending up in a shop off Las Ramblas on Thursday as a van ploughed into the crowds outside. The shop\u2019s doors were locked and panic spread as people began to suspect that something serious was taking place outside. \u201cThe next second, we were literally running for our lives to the very back of the store, where we were told to get on the ground away from the windows and lay as flat as possible,\u201d Monaco told the Australian radio station 3AW. Along with about 10 others \u2013 including two screaming children \u2013 Monaco hid behind a clothing display for about 30 minutes, before being evacuated by police. She later made it safely back to where she was staying. Monaco said she was rattled by her third brush with terror, but adamant that she would continue her travels. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like I want to go home,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel like I want to stay here and not let them, whoever they might be, win.\u201d The Barcelona-based newspaper La Vanguardia reported late on Friday afternoon that the police were hunting four suspects. It named them as 17-year-old Moussa Oukabir \u2013 the suspect thought to have driven the van along Las Ramblas \u2013 Mohamed Hychami, 24, Younes Abouyaaqoub, 22, and Said Aallaa, 18. All live in or close to the Catalonian town of Ripoll. Oukabir\u2019s age has also been given elsewhere as 18. A British family who were metres away from the Las Ramblas van attack, have praised the quick reactions of the police and the kindness of strangers, which made them feel secure. Jackie Rado, 51, and her daughter Kristin RadoBarr, 14, who were on a family holiday with Tony Barr, 46, and Alexander RadoBarr, 12, were shopping at the make-up shop Sephora 100 yards from La Rambla. The family were separated for three hours as the area was put on lockdown. \u2018My son was waiting for us, that was hard for him\u2019 \u2013 Jackie Rado, 51, London We were just about to leave Sephora, on the corner of La Rambla, and get ice -cream at La Bocqueria, but we were distracted by something on sale. We were on the ground floor and suddenly people started to race downstairs, hysterical. We were scared and no one knew what was going on. We could hear sirens. We were right where it was happening. We were locked in the store for three and a half hours. I just kept trying not to think about it and stay calm. I keep pushing away the thought of what might have happened if we hadn\u2019t done an about-turn in the store. \u2018I was very relieved when they came home. At that point we felt the danger has passed\u2019 \u2013 Tony Barr, 46 I was in the southwest of the area with my son, visiting football stores. As we were coming out of the metro on our way back to the hotel, people were telling us not to come to the area. There were a lot of street vendors at the top of the subway standing in a group and waving us away, telling us not to come up. People were panicking and rushing and screaming. They checked everyone\u2019s ID at the hotel before entering and kept everyone updated. We were in lockdown. People are going out of their way to interact and smile to Muslim guests. At the toaster this morning, I discussed with a Muslim woman how hot we should put the toaster. It wasn\u2019t forced, but I\u2019m aware that we should all be thoughtful. I wasn\u2019t worried for our safety, but I was very upset and angry knowing how close they were to my family. They\u2019d been closer to it than many people. I was upset about the intent of it. I was very relieved when they came home. European security services have sometimes struggled to keep up with the reaction of militant networks when prepared attack plans go awry, whether through their own deliberate intervention or some kind of unexpected accident, such as the blast at Cambrils. Bombs in Brussels in March last year which killed 35 people, including three attackers, came 48 hours after police raids targeting the network responsible. Several members escaped the dragnet and went on to launch an improvised operation. Rafaello Pantucci, an expert on Islamic militancy at Royal United Services Institute think-tank, said: There\u2019s always an anxiety after a disruption if it\u2019s unclear whether [the authorities] have got the entire cell or network, and what the reaction of any missing members might be. Some militants, such as the Barcelona attackers, respond by rushing to execute new plans. Others go to ground. Mohammed Sadiq Khan, who led the 7/7 attackers in London in 2005 suspected he had been identified as a potential threat by MI5 owing to his peripheral involvement with a network responsible for an earlier abortive operation. Khan kept a low-profile for several months, before emerging to lead his own attack. Though Spain had escaped an Islamist militant terrorist attack since 2004, the country has long been among those in Europe which are seen as facing an elevated threat. Its counter-terrorist services are broadly respected by counterparts across the continent and in the US. They routinely co-operate with North African services, particularly those of Morocco. Thursday\u2019s horrific attack doesn\u2019t just sadden me but feels like a personal assault. Read Harry Eyres\u2019 love letter to Barcelona and, more specifically, Las Ramblas. The Queen has sent a message of condolence to the king and people of Spain. It is deeply upsetting when innocent people are put at risk in this way when going about their daily lives. Our thoughts and prayers are with those who have lost loved ones and the people who are recovering in hospital. Please convey our heartfelt sympathies to all who have been affected by these appalling incidents. Lorenzo Vidino, the director of the Program on Extremism at George Washington University and an expert on radicalisation and jihadist networks in the west, said Salafism has strong roots in Catalonia. There is a long history of Salafism there, which is a different thing from violence and jihadism, so we have to be careful about that. There is a very extensive and entrenched Salafist community in Catalonia. It\u2019s not really in Barcelona. It\u2019s really in the rural areas and the coastal areas. It\u2019s almost exclusively Moroccan and started about 20 years ago with a lot of self-styled sheikhs. Keep in mind it\u2019s a very rural migrant population living in poverty, it\u2019s uneducated and a lot of people work in agriculture. You have these Salafist mosques which have traditionally received quite a lot of funding from the Gulf \u2013 the usual suspects, the Saudis, Qatar and particularly Kuwait. The community organises very large gatherings during the Christmas and Easter holidays, because it is the gateway for migrants who live in continental Europe. If you are a Moroccan living in Holland or France or Germany, you can fly back home, but a lot of people drive. If you drive from Brussels or Paris, you drive through Catalonia. It\u2019s a very logical of way of going. So they do these very large gatherings, so you will see in small towns, say of 10,000 people, gatherings on Christmas Day of five or six thousand people and only a few are Moroccans from Catalonia. The speakers are big sheikhs from Saudi, from Kuwait, from other European countries. So that\u2019s a very big scene there. Vidino stressed the distinction between Salafism and radicalisation and support for violence. There are different currents. There are currents there that are very conservative but not necessarily supporting violence. Having said that, it\u2019s undeniable that that environment has created a milieu that is fertile for further radicalisation. It explains why there is more radicalisation than any other part of mainland Spain. However, radicalisation is measured by the number of foreign fighters going to Syria or Iraq. There is less of a problem in Spain that in northern European countries. Vidino said about 200 had gone from Spain, a quarter of those who have travelled from the UK and less than one seventh of the number of French foreign fighters. Further to the American who died in Spain, the US State Department says at least one more suffered a minor wound. Details have begun to emerge of how one Catalan police officer shot dead four of the five attackers who tried to run people down in the coastal town of Cambrils in the early hours of Friday morning. Police chief Josep Lluis Trapero, who is leading the investigation into the attacks, told a press conference on Friday afternoon that one officer had managed to kill all but one of the attackers. He said that it was \u201cnot easy\u201d for the officer involved despite being a professional. According to the Barcelona-based paper La Vanguardia, a team of Mossos d\u2019Esquadra was stationed at a police checkpoint near the roundabout outside the Club Nautic restaurant when the attackers\u2019 Audi A3 ran down three people before smashing into the police car. Seeing a colleague injured in the crash and noticing the terrorists emerging from their car with knives, machetes and axes, the officer raised his rifle and shot four of them dead. The fifth attacker managed to escape and stab a pedestrian in the face before he was shot by another officer with a submachinegun. According to La Vanguardia, the officer who shot the four attackers had been due to go on holiday this week. He is understood to be receiving psychological support in the aftermath of the incident. One American has been confirmed among those who died in Spain, the US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, has said. Richard Gregg, from Dartford, in Kent, is on holiday in Barcelona. He said it was only good fortune that prevented him being among the victims of the attack on La Rambla. The drama teacher and his partner were on a side road trying to return to their apartment off the main thoroughfare when they became aware of a commotion. People were running, shouting: \u2018People have been hit, there\u2019s blood everywhere.\u2019 We had nowhere to go apart from into Las Ramblas. We wanted to get back to our apartment and thought it might just be a car accident. It was quite surreal, literally. The van had just come to a stop on our road. Half the people didn\u2019t know what had gone on at all. There was a large number of people from further up running away from what had happened. He said police were flooding the side roads looking for someone he now knows to be the van driver, while other officers attended to victims on the ground. We have been out [today] on La Rambla to see where the van ended up and where everyone was hurt and we\u2019re really grateful because if we\u2019d been there two minutes earlier or the van had been two minutes later we would have been in the path of it without a shadow of a doubt. Gregg said he and his partner were shaken but determined to join the rest of their time in Barcelona before flying to Gran Canaria on Monday. The mood is fairly defiant. There\u2019s quite a large crowd gathering, of people determined they\u2019re not going to let any form of terrorist atrocity detract from the way of life in Barcelona. At the end of the day we come from just south of London and had friends in the London Bridge attack. You can be caught up at any time, you just don\u2019t know. We\u2019re going to stay, we\u2019re going to enjoy Barcelona as best we can. Trapero said police have no information connecting a police shootout in Sant Just Desvern, near Barcelona, on Thursday with the Las Ramblas and Cambrils attacks. \u201cWe can\u2019t link this incident to any of the other incidents,\u201d he said. Our graphics team have put together a timeline map of the attacks: Trapero confirmed that the Cambrils attackers were wearing fake suicide belts. \u201cThey were carrying belts which looked like suicide vests, but in the end they turned out to be fake,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were trying to simulate explosives.\u201d He said the investigation is focused on those in the building in Alcanar and the vehicles in Barcelona and Cambrils. According to a BBC translation, he said: We think they [the suspects in Alcanar] were preparing at least one or more attacks in Barcelona. The explosion took out some of the material they were counting on to carrying out even bigger attacks than the ones that happened. Because of that the attacks were carried out in a more rudimentary way than the one initially planned. Trapero also revealed that a single police officer killed four of the suspects who carried out the attack in the Catalan seaside town of Cambrils. He said it was \u201cnot easy\u201d for the officer involved, despite being a professional. A total of five suspects were killed after the Cambrils attack in which a car ploughed into a crowd, killing a woman. Trapero confirmed that the driver of the Barcelona van has still not been identified. He said one of the five suspects killed in Cambrils could have been the driver in Barcelona. He added: \u201cWe\u2019re working on the hypothesis that the authors [of the attacks] had been planning them both for a while in the building in Alcanar, but we can\u2019t join up all the scenarios. It was a group \u2013 we don\u2019t have a concrete number \u2013 but we\u2019re not discounting the idea that they were planning other attacks.\u201d Trapero said there would be more news in a few hours. Police chief Josep Lluis Trapero, who is leading the investigation into the attacks, said none of the four suspects arrested so far has a record of terrorist activity. Three people in Ripoll and another in Alcanar have been arrested, he confirmed. \u201cNone of them have any kind of terrorist background,\u201d he said. Three of those arrested are Moroccan citizens and one is Spanish, he added. The youngest was 21; the others were 28, 34 and 27. He confirmed that police are working on the assumption that a bomb plot was being hatched at the home in Alcanar where there was an explosion on Wednesday. The explosion meant that a bigger attack being planned was not possible: they had to use more rudimentary methods instead. He added: \u201cIt was a group, we do not know the specific number, but we do not rule out that they had other attacks in mind.\u201d He said there was a \u201cclear link\u201d between the Alcanar explosion and the attacks in Barcelona and Cambrils. The shouts of \u201cI\u2019m not afraid\u201d rang out across Barcelona\u2019s Pla\u00e7a Catalunya, repeated rhythmically by the thousands who had gathered at noon in the hot sun to pay respects to the dead and injured in Thursday\u2019s terrorist atrocity. Red roses were held aloft during a minute\u2019s silence, broken only by the distant wail of a siren \u2013 a reminder that at least one of the perpetrators is still at large. King Felipe VI and Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy joined the residents and visitors for the vigil. The Catalan president, the mayor of Barcelona and other leading political figures were also in attendance. \u201cUnfortunately, Spaniards know the absurd and irrational pain that terrorism causes,\u201d Rajoy said, as he declared three days of mourning. \u201cWe have received blows like this in recent years, but we also that terrorists can be beaten.\u201d Afterwards, the crowds descended down Las Ramblas, the wide boulevard that runs south from Pla\u00e7a Catalunya, in an act of reclamation. Fitzroy Davies, from Wolverhampton, West Midlands, who filmed the Cambrils attack (see earlier), said the suspects appeared to be using drink cans as part of fake suicide vests. The five suspects, who were all killed, were wearing fake vests, police said after conducting controlled explosions. Davies said: They were running from a man wearing what appeared to be a suicide jacket but it looked fake. One of our colleagues, Winston, got up and saw people running past him and shouted: \u2018Run, run.\u2019 That\u2019s when I started filming what was happening. I didn\u2019t run away because I was thinking \u2013 \u2018If this guy gets away and they need evidence then I want to help.\u2019 I watch CSI Miami and all those programmes that was one of the reasons why I did that. It looked like he was wearing Coke cans on him. I was about 15ft away and it didn\u2019t look real. Within what felt like about 30 seconds the police came and shots were fired. The guy went down to the floor and then he came back up again. He was smiling. It looked like he was high on drugs. Then he was shot again and this time he didn\u2019t get back up. I wasn\u2019t scared during the whole event. But afterwards I spoke to my wife and she was mad at me ... she said anything could have happened. Catalan president Carles Puigdemont praised the person who shouted \u201cWe are not afraid\u201d after the minute\u2019s silence in Barcelona. \u201cWe are determined to win against terrorism with the best weapon that our society has and that is solidarity, freedom, respect. \u201cAs proof of that we had this spontaneous with this shout of \u2018We are not afraid.\u2019 This has reconquered our public space. This is our weapon.\u201d The German foreign office has revealed that 13 German nationals are among those injured during Thursday\u2019s attack on Las Ramblas. Some of them were injured seriously and were still fighting for their lives, said spokesperson Martin Sch\u00e4fer. He said he could neither confirm nor rule out earlier reports that three German citizens were among the 14 who died in the attack. German media are reporting that a group of three teenage girls from Oberhausen in North-Rhine Westphalia are among those injured. Two 17-year-olds and one 14-year-old had been on a day trip to Barcelona when the incident occurred. Rajoy spoke of the determination of the authorities to stop the perpetrators of the attacks as quickly as possible. Spain\u2019s prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, and Catalan president, Carles Puigdemont, are giving a press conference in Barcelona. \u201cThe fight against terrorism is what concerns us most across Europe,\u201d Rajoy said according to a BBC translation. The level of terror alert in Spain will be reviewed at a meeting in Madrid on Saturday, he added. Responding to a question about hiring vans, May said: We must look carefully, of course, at the powers that our police and agencies need to be able to deal with terrorism. That\u2019s why the government has initiated a review, which we did after the attacks that took place in Manchester and London earlier this year, to look at the capabilities that our police have to deal with this threat. But, as we see from the attack in Barcelona, this is a threat that is faced across the world and we must work together to rid the internet of the poisonous material that drives terrorism and to deal with the terrorists. Theresa May says the authorities are looking into reports of a British child believed to be missing in Spain following the attacks. In a pooled interview she said: This morning, I spoke with Mariano Rajoy, the Spanish prime minister, to offer my deepest condolences after the terrible attack that took place in Barcelona. And the UK stands shoulder-to-shoulder with Spain in confronting and dealing with the evil of terrorism and I have offered any assistance that we can provide. Sadly, I must tell that we do believe that a number of British nationals were caught up in the attack and we\u2019re urgently looking into reports of a child believed missing, who is a British dual national. The Foreign Office is offering consular assistance to those who were involved in the attack and their families and are working urgently to see if there are others who need their help. But we must work together if we are to confront this evil of terrorism. Also, to confront and deal with the perverted extremist ideology which drives it; ridding the internet of poisonous material and ensuring that our police and security services have the powers that they need. Terrorism is the great threat that we all face. But, together, we will defeat it. Catalan officials have listed (in Catalan) the 34 different nationalities of those killed and injured in both attacks. The foreign ministers of Germany and France are due to arrive in Barcelona later on Friday. Sigmar Gabriel and Jean-Yves Le Drian said they wanted to show their solidarity with the victims, according to El Pais. The mayor of Nice, where 86 people were killed a year ago by an attacker driving a lorry, has said he will convene European counterparts next month to see how they can improve security in the aftermath of the latest attacks, Reuters reports. \u201cI am convinced that life will prevail over death and that we will triumph over barbarism and terror,\u201d Christian Estrosi told reporters after honouring Barcelona\u2019s victims on the Promenade des Anglais, where dozens died on Bastille Day last year. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that it is the mayors - be it in Berlin, London, Paris, Nice, Barcelona or Stockholm - that are the first to be confronted with this violence and who manage these public areas ... but we are not the ones who take part in the big national and European reforms,\u201d he said. Estrosi said he had taken the difficult decision to spend \u20ac30m from his budget to protect potential target areas in Nice from possible vehicle attacks, and that cities needed more money to cope with the new threats. He said the mayors of a number of cities, which he did not name, would meet on 28 September in Nice with Julian King, the European commissioner in charge of security issues. They would discuss ways to improve the situation and review national and European legislation and proposals that were at times too restrictive. \u201cWe won\u2019t win the war with the rules of peace,\u201d Estrosi said. The number of people injured in the attacks in Barcelona Cambrils has risen to 130, Reuters reports, citing an emergency services spokesman. He said 17 were in a critical condition and another 30 were in a serious condition. Emergency services said in a statement that the dead and injured in the two attacks were of 34 different nationalities. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has chaired a crisis meeting in Barcelona. The meeting was held to co-ordinate the investigation into the terrorist attacks. He said on Twitter that the meeting was to \u201canalyse the latest details of the attacks in Barcelona and Cambrils\u201d. A fourth person has been arrested in connection with the attacks, according to the Spanish media, citing a police source. Francisco L\u00f3pez Rodr\u00edguez, 57, is the first Spanish victim to be named in the Barcelona attack. His wife was seriously injured in the attack on La Rambla in Barcelona, according to El Pais. A woman waving a tiny Spanish flag during a vigil for the victims at Pla\u00e7a de Catalunya was rounded on by the crowd who called on her to remove it. Members of the 20,000-strong crowd said the attacks should not be politicised and that national flags were not welcome at the event. Gary Fisher, 57, from Notting Hill in London, a holidaymaker who attended the minute\u2019s silence in Pla\u00e7a de Catalunya, says there was a noticeable absence of national flags. \u201cAfter the minute\u2019s silence everyone started clapping. People were chanting \u2018we shall not fear\u2019. A woman who was waving a Spanish flag, but she was shouted at to put it away. She was upset and took the flag down. Some people want to show the flag to come together as a nation. But people in the crowd were saying this was not a time for nationalism. \u201cAfter that everyone filled out and walked slowly down Las Ramblas,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was very moving. Everyone is very calm and dignified today. It\u2019s back to normal. Last night I was busy until 1.30am. I went to some of the bars which were packed with people, and the beach was full, and people were even playing beach volleyball.\u201d British police are to meet holidaymakers returning from Catalonia at the border to take statements, Scotland Yard\u2019s lead for counter-terrorism policing, Mark Rowley, has said. He added that the terrorism threat was global and nations needed to work together to defeat it. Our thoughts are with Spain, the victims, their families and all the other people affected by yesterday\u2019s barbaric attack in Barcelona. We are liaising closely with the Spanish authorities and await further updates regarding the nationalities of the deceased and injured. Officers are at UK ports today ready to meet British holiday-makers returning to the UK from the region in order to take any witness accounts. Anyone who has returned from Spain can also call the confidential hotline with information on 0800 789 321. We are also urging people who have images or footage that may assist investigators to upload them to Ukpoliceimageappeal.com The current threat is global and it is only by working together that it can be defeated. Our network of counter-terrorism police liaison officers posted in locations around the world help us connect investigations internationally. We have a long tradition of collaboration with the very capable Spanish police on terrorism matters. Rowley said the UK threat level remained at severe, meaning an attack is highly likely. The Foreign Office said earlier it was helping a \u201csmall number\u201d of British citizens caught up in the Barcelona attack. It has now clarified that those people were injured. A spokeswoman said: Our thoughts are with the victims of these terrible attacks and the people of Spain. We are currently assisting a small number of British people affected and are working to find out if any more need our help. We have deployed additional staff to Barcelona and have offered support to the Spanish authorities. Following the minute\u2019s silence in Barcelona, the crowd shouted \u2018I\u2019m not afraid\u2019. Standing silent in the Plaza de Catalunya, Rajoy joined the king and Carles Puigdemont, the president of Catalonia. Rajoy and Puigdemont, who are at loggerheads as the separatist Catalan government attempts to break away from Spain, put their differences aside. The death toll of the attacks in Spain has risen to 14 people; two of whom have been named: Bruno Gulotta, a father of two, and 44-year-old Elke Vanbockrijck from the Belgian town of Tongeren. Spanish police are searching for Moussa Oukabir, who they believe was driving the van in the Barcelona attack. He is the younger brother of Driss Oukabir \u2013 one of three people arrested by police thus far. The UK Foreign Office confirmed that it was helping a \u201csmall number\u201d of British citizens caught up in the Barcelona attack. It would not say whether they had been injured. Here is what we know about the related terrorist attacks that took place on Thursday and Friday: Barcelona A man drove a van into pedestrians in Las Ramblas, killing 13 people and injuring 100. The first victim of the attack was named as an Italian father of two, Bruno Gulotta. He was on holiday with his partner and children, according to his workmates. Spanish police are hunting Moussa Oukabir, the teenager who is suspected of being the driver of the van. A minute\u2019s silence was held in Barcelona\u2019s main square, followed by several minutes of applause. Spain\u2019s King Felipe and its prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, attended. A minute\u2019s silence was also held at the EU buildings in Brussels. A seven-year-old Australian boy, Julian Cadman, became separated from his mother, who is in a serious but stable condition in hospital. Authorities say the subsequent attack in Cambrils is linked to the terrorist assault on Barcelona. Two suspects arrested on Thursday are being held on suspicion of links to the Barcelona attack, but police say neither of them was the driver. A second van that was believed to have been used as a getaway vehicle for the Barcelona attacker was found abandoned in Vic, 50 miles (80km) away. Isis has claimed responsibility for the attack in Las Ramblas, but this could not be verified. Cambrils A second terrorist attack took place in Cambrils, a coastal town around 120km from Barcelona, in the early hours of Friday. One person was killed and five bystanders and one police officer were injured \u2013 two seriously \u2013 when they were reported to have been deliberately hit by a car. The attackers were wearing fake suicide vests, according to Catalan officials cited by El Pais. The Audi A3 used in the Cambrils attack was removed by police. Its back window was smashed and it was upside down. Police officers shot dead five suspects, some of whom were wearing what appeared to be explosive belts. Javier Zaragoza, the head of the Audiencia Nacional, the court that deals with terror offences, said on Friday that those killed had no known links to jihadism. Alcanar Officials are also linking the two attacks to an earlier explosion that destroyed a house in Alcanar, killing one person and wounding at least one more. Police now say they believe explosives were being prepared at the property. Alcanar is about 200km (124 miles) from Barcelona and 90km (56 miles) from Cambrils. Sant Just Desvern On Thursday, a man was found dead after a shootout at a police roadblock in a town close to Barcelona. Police said it was not connected to the attack in Las Ramblas. On Friday morning, it emerged that the dead man \u2013 the owner of the car \u2013 was not in the driver\u2019s seat and had in fact been stabbed to death. A hunt is under way for the person driving the car to the roadblock. It is now thought possible that this incident is also linked to the attacks in Barcelona and Cambrils, and the explosion in Alcanar.

The death toll from both attacks has risen to 14 after a woman died from her injuries in the Cambrils died attack, the Catalan emergency services have confirmed. The Foreign Office in London has confirmed that it is helping a \u201csmall number\u201d of British citizens caught up in the Barcelona attack. It would not say whether they had been injured. A spokeswoman said: \u201cOur thoughts are with the victims of these terrible attacks and the people of Spain.\u201d \u201cWe are currently assisting a small number of British people affected and are working to find out if any more need our help. We have deployed additional staff to Barcelona and have offered support to the Spanish authorities.\u201d Belgian officials have identified a woman from the town of Tongeren killed in the van attack in Barcelona as Elke Vanbockrijck, AP reports. Two officials, who declined to be identified on the record, confirmed Vanbockrijck\u2019s name. Tongeren Mayor Patrick Dewael said in a tweet late Thursday that a woman from his town had died, and sent his condolences. He told Belgian radio that he had presided over her wedding in 2014. Belgian media said the 44-year-old woman was holidaying in Barcelona with her husband and sons. Foreign minister Didier Reynders also confirmed that two Belgians were injured in the attack, one of them seriously. Peter Beyen, from Ostend claimed to be a colleague. He tweeted: Video of the aftermath of the Cambrils attack has been published by BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. It was taken by Fitzroy Davies (see earlier). Scott Strudwick, from the UK, was on holiday with his family, including two children, in Barcelona when he was caught up in the attack on Las Ramblas. They were heading towards the popular tourist spot to get a bus back to their hotel when they saw people running in the opposite direction and police pushing them into shops. He ended up in a department store with his family. Strudwick told the BBC: We were on the second floor of the shop and people came running through the shop. We later found out that there was a rumour that they\u2019d been gunfire and potentially a terrorist in the shop, which turned out to be false but at that point they didn\u2019t know that. We didn\u2019t understand what was going on because we don\u2019t speak Spanish, which was probably a blessing in hindsight. But the panic was quite infectious and we were all driven back into the back of the shop and then we went into a hairdressing salon and we hid in a small storage cupboard at the end [of the salon]. We were crammed in, it was very frightening, lots of people crying, lots of people very upset. But Strudwick said they were hoping to continue their holiday. He said: Life seems to be returning to normal, I think people are fairly resilient. These sort of attacks, people don\u201dt want them to get the best of them, they\u2019re trying to go on. We certainly will be taking advice but our plans will be to go and do pretty much what we were going to do yesterday, albeit we\u2019ll be obviously much more aware. Thousands of people have also held a minute\u2019s silence in Barcelona\u2019s main square. The event was attended by Spain\u2019s king Felipe its prime minister Mariano Rajoy. The silence was followed by several minutes of applause. A minute\u2019s silence has been held at the European Union buildings in Brussels where flags have been lowered to half-mast. What can be done after Europe\u2019s seventh vehicle attack in a year, asks Simon Jenkins. Toning down the reporting would help, he suggests. It would help if grotesque publicity were not given to these acts of terror. It distorts risk, encourages imitation and undermines freedom from fear. How to report yet not \u201cpromote\u201d, how to convey sympathy without propagating fear, is a skill at which the media is all at sea. The first victim to be named in the Barcelona attack was an Italian father of two. Bruno Gulotta was on holiday with his partner and two children, according to his workmates at Tom\u2019s Hardware. The company\u2019s Facebook page said it was in mourning. The Telegraph adds: Gulotta was crushed to death on the Ramblas by the terrorist lorry while strolling down the Ramblas hand in hand with his five-year-old son who his wife, Martina, managed to snatch to safety in the nick of time, she was quoted as telling friends. Martina was following her husband carrying their seven-month-old baby girl, Aria, in a rucksack she was wearing on her chest when Bruno was run down, la Repubblica newspaper quoted her telling his workmates. Martina grabbed their son Alessandro, aged five, and rushed both children to safety but Gulotta, aged 35, was killed instantly. Barcelona will proudly rise stronger from this day of horror, writes Francesc Badia i Dalmases, editor of DemocraciaAbierta. It will remain a modern, attractive, cosmopolitan and increasingly global city. We are all united in this endless battle against extremism, and today there is less room than ever for what Robert Kaplan once brilliantly called the narcissism of small differences. Spanish police investigating the Barcelona terrorist attack are hunting a teenager who is suspected of driving the van that ploughed along Las Ramblas on Thursday, killing at least 13 people and injuring more than 100. Police sources have told Spanish media that the man they are looking for is Moussa Oukabir, the younger brother of Driss Oukabir, who was arrested yesterday on suspicion of hiring the van used in the attack. Driss Oukabir has denied involvement and is reported to have told police that his identity documents had been stolen and used to obtain the vehicle. Catalan police believe that Moussa Oukabir, who is 18, according to El Pais, fled the scene of the atrocity by road and is still on the run. He is reported elsewhere to be 17. Officers have so far arrested three people, including Driss Oukabir, in connection with the attack. In a series of tweets, the Holby City actor Laila Rouass said she hid in a freezer in a restaurant during the attack on Las Ramblas. Rouass is partner to five times snooker world champion Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan. Police have removed the black Audi used in the attack in Cambrils. The broadcaster RTVE has published an image of the 18-year-old Las Ramblas suspect Moussa Oukabir. Moussa Oukabir is believed to be the younger brother of Driss Oukabir, who was arrested in Ripoll, north of Barcelona. He is reported to have told police that his identity documents were stolen before they were used to rent the van. Police investigating the cell behind the attack are working on the theory that the numerous butane gas bottles at the site of the explosion in Alcanar on Wednesday were to be used in a bomb attack in Barcelona. An explosion occurred while they were being prepared as bombs, police assume. Amy Howell, 42, from Dallas was on holiday in Barcelona when the attack took place. My friend and I were walking in the area and all of sudden I dropped sunglasses and they broke. I ran into Mango, the clothing store, to grab a new pair when all of a sudden I just heard screaming. Then the next thing I know everyone was running out and there was just complete chaos. The scary thing is seeing the looks on everyone\u2019s face as they came towards you, it was clear something horrible had happened. I shouted for my friend and the next thing we knew, we were pulling down the security gates at the shop. There were gunshots and we barricaded ourselves in, shutting all the lights off and turning off all the music. All you could hear was silence. It was really weird. Barcelona is a fun, big, busy, loud city and for a good three hours you could hear a pin drop. We were just locked in the store. Some people were crying, a few kids crying. It was surreal. No one could believe what was going on and then an older lady either had a heart attack or stroke or something. The Mango staff ended up doing CPR and we thought she might die. The staff saved her life and she recovered but she couldn\u2019t get into an ambulance until some time later. After about three hours the police came and let us out. Me and my friend didn\u2019t cry about everything that happened until we sat down and had a glass of wine in a cafe later. Spanish police have a named a 18-year-old suspect in the Barcelona attack, El Mundo reports. Moussa Oukabir is suspected to be the driver of Las Ramblas van. Earlier, Driss Oukabir, originally named as the suspect, was arrested in Ripoll, north of Barcelona. He is reported to have told police that his identity documents were stolen before they were used to rent the van. Fitzroy Davies, from Wolverhampton, was caught up in the second attack in Cambrils. He said he was in Spain for a judo camp and in a meeting with the coaches in a bar when the incident unfolded. He told the BBC: \u201cThese girls ran into the bar off the street and then people were running up the road. One of our guys stood up, looked and just said \u2018run\u2019, so we all ran. This guy came running up the road and was shouting something. I didn\u2019t know what it was, so we said call the police. Within 30 seconds the police was [sic] already there, jumped out of the car, started shouting at the guy; the guy was then saying something else again. And then they - \u2018pop, pop\u2019 - did a couple of shots and he fell down. He stood back up and then he stepped over the fence and he started, he was taunting, smiling and he carried on walking to the police, and then they gave it to him again, a couple more shots and then he fell to the ground.\u201d Four Cubans were injured in Barcelona and a fifth was hurt in the Cambrils attack, according to the news site Cuba Debate. The Cuban Embassy in Spain and its Consulate in Barcelona have been in contact with the families of the four Cubans injured in Barcelona. A fifth was slightly injured in Cambrils and has since been discharged from hospital. China\u2019s foreign ministry said two people from Taiwan were severely injured in the Barcelona attack, writes Wang Zhen in Beijing. Chinese president, Xi Jinping, and its premier, Li Keqing, have both written to King Felipe of Spain to express their condolences over the terror attack in Barcelona. Hua Chunying, a spokesperson for China\u2019s foreign ministry, said: \u201cChina strongly condemns the terrorist attack in Barcelona, Spain. We send our condolences to the victims and their families, and express our sympathy to those who were injured.\u201d Hua said two people from Taiwan had been severely injured in the attack and were being treated in hospital. A Hong Kong citizen sustained light injuries and has been discharged. Hua told reporters: \u201cI want to reiterate here, China is firmly against any forms of terrorism, and firmly offers its support for Spain\u2019s efforts to combat terrorism and safeguard its national security. China will also strengthen cooperation with the international community, including Spain, in this regard\u201d Barcelona is known as a focal point of jihadist radicalisation in Spain. A study published in June by West Point\u2019s Combating Terrorism Center, found that of the 178 individuals arrested in Spain in the last three years for terrorism-related activities almost a quarter came from Barcelona. Nine out of every 10 detainees radicalized partly or fully while inside Spain. However, far from this phenomenon happening uniformly with respect to the size and distribution of the Muslim population across the country, it occurred in clusters. The four administrative demarcations where detainees radicalized coincide with their residence: the Catalonian province of Barcelona (23.2%), the North African city of Ceuta (22.2%), Madrid and its metropolitan area (19.2%), and Melilla, the other Spanish enclave surrounded by Moroccan territory (12.1%). Max Gayler, 23, from Birmingham witnessed the aftermath of the attack in Barcelona. He said: I am sat right where I was yesterday. I live close to the centre and was walking to see a friend on other side of city when I heard screaming, lots of it at first. Half a second later people started coming down a really narrow ally surround Las Rambas. Everyone was yelling at me and telling me to run. Then the police turned up and they were also telling people to run down the street I left immediately. I was very lucky I didn\u2019t see anyone initially hit but as I walking away I went past one of smaller local health centres. I saw someone surrounded by people. When it happened you just join the crowd \u2013 the fear hits you and you just immediately need to get away. It feels surreal. You run for about 30 seconds and then stop and check to see if it\u2019s real. Police were pushing people back. By the end of last night you could not get anywhere near the centre, everything was shut down. Lots of people were stranded. I have a friend who was at top of Las Rambas in a cafe and they were locked in for two and half hours. Hotels were keeping people in and helping people in whatever way they could. Some time in the night the police pushed the tape back and allowed people to access Las Rambas again. The atmosphere today is very strange \u2013 people are going about their businesses as if nothing happened. It\u2019s very quiet. Barcelona is notoriously loud and never sleeps but lots of people very quiet right now. A seven-year-old boy who became separated from his mother is missing after the Barcelona terror attack, his Australian family say. Sydney man Tony Cadman has posted on Facebook that his grandson Julian Cadman is missing and the boy\u2019s mum Jom is in a serious but stable condition in hospital. His father Andrew Cadman said he had spoken to his son only hours before he went missing. Cadman was travelling to Barcelona to search for Julian. His family have been sharing a photo of Julian to help in the search for the boy. The foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, has said one Australian is missing and four others have been injured in the attack. The authorities investigating both the Barcelona and Cambrils attacks believe a cell of eight people may have been involved, according to Reuters. They had been planning an attack with gas canisters, it said citing an unnamed judicial source. PA has more on injuries to an Irish family caught up in the Barcelona attack. A five-year-old Irish boy suffered a broken leg when his family was caught up in the terror attack in Barcelona, The boy\u2019s father also has leg injuries. Ireland\u2019s foreign affairs minister, Simon Coveney, said: \u201cThey are not life-threatening, I\u2019m relieved to say. \u201cBut in a way it\u2019s a miracle that more Irish people weren\u2019t involved, given that there are so many Irish people in Spain, Barcelona and Cambrils at this time of year.\u201d The father and son were part a family of four, including the mother and a daughter, and are understood to have been on a trip to celebrate the boy\u2019s birthday. The youngster suffered a broken femur. The mother and father are understood to be from Cebu in the Philippines and are naturalised Irish citizens. They hold dual citizenship. The children were born in Ireland. Ireland\u2019s Department of Foreign Affairs is assisting the family. Its officials opened a hotline in Dublin for anyone concerned about relatives in Spain on 01-408 2000 while the Irish Embassy in Madrid was also fielding calls on +34 9143 64093. The suspects in the Cambrils attack were wearing fake suicide vests according to Catalan officials cited by El Pais. Controlled explosions confirmed the vests were fake, according to a Catalan radio journalist. All five suspects were shot dead by police. A similar tactic was used in the London Bridge attack in June. All three of the attackers in that incident wore leather belts that were attached to disposable water bottles wrapped in silver masking tape, an attempt to replicate a suicide bomb belt. Ireland\u2019s Department of Foreign Affairs has confirmed it is helping an Irish family of four caught up in the attack. A father of two, originally from the Philippines but who lives in Ireland was on holiday with his wife and two children, when he was hit on the side.

A third suspect has been arrested on Friday morning in Ripoll, north of Barcelona. Driss Oukabir, originally named as the suspect, was arrested in the same town on Thursday. He is reported to have told police that his identity documents were stolen before they were used to rent the van. Here is what we know about the related terror attacks that took place on Thursday and Friday: Cambrils A second terror attack took place in Cambrils, a coastal town around 120km from Barcelona, in the early hours of Friday morning. Six bystanders and one police officer were injured \u2013 two seriously \u2013 when they were reportedly deliberately hit by a car. An overturned Audi A3, with its back window smashed, was pictured at the scene. Police officers shot dead five suspects, some of whom were wearing what appeared to be explosive belts. Javier Zaragoza, the head of the Audiencia Nacional, the court that deals with terror offences, said on Friday that those killed had no known links to jihadism. Barcelona Authorities say the Cambrils attack is linked to the terrorist assault on Barcelona on Thursday, when a man drove a van into pedestrians in Las Ramblas, killing 13 people and injuring 100 more. The driver escaped the scene and remains at large. Two suspects arrested on Thursday are being held on suspicion of links to the Barcelona attack, but police say neither of them is the driver. A second van that was believed to have been used as a getaway vehicle for the Barcelona attacker was found abandoned in Vic, 80km away. Isis has claimed responsibility for the attack in Las Ramblas, but this could not be verified. Alcanar Officials are also linking the two attacks to an earlier explosion that destroyed a house in Alcanar, killing one person and wounding at least one more. Police now say they believe explosives were being prepared at the property. Alcanar is around 200km (124 miles) from Barcelona and 90km (56 miles) from Cambrils. Sant Just Desvern On Thursday, a shootout at a police roadblock in a town close to Barcelona left a man dead. Police said it was not connected to the attack in Las Ramblas. On Friday morning, it emerged that the dead man \u2013 the owner of the car \u2013 was not in the driver\u2019s seat and had in fact been stabbed to death. A hunt is now underway for the person driving the car to the roadblock. It is possible that this incident is also linked to the attacks in Barcelona and Cambrils, and the explosion in Alcanar. Emergency services now say more than 100 people injured in the attack in Las Ramblas are being treated in 15 hospitals across the region. Javier Zaragoza, the head of the Audiencia Nacional, the court that deals with terror offences, has said the Cambrils terrorists had no known links to jihadism. Five suspects were shot dead by police in the early hours of Friday morning after reportedly running down pedestrians with a car. The vehicle \u2013 an Audi A3 \u2013 is pictured this morning in the seaside town, overturned and with its back windscreen smashed or shot out. The attacks in Spain have dominated newspaper front pages around the world. Read our roundup here. Spain\u2019s Ara leads with the headline Sense Por \u2013 Without Fear. The youngest victim of the Barcelona attack is believed to be a three-year-old girl. A six-year-old girl is also seriously ill in hospital. Citizens from 24 countries are among the 13 killed and 100 wounded in the attack in Las Ramblas, Catalan officials said. Three of the dead are believed to be German. Belgium\u2019s foreign affairs minister, Didier Reynders, confirmed one Belgian had also died. France says 26 of its citizens are injured, at least 11 of them seriously. Four Australians were wounded: two women remain in hospital in a serious but stable condition, while two men were treated and released. Three people from the Netherlands are among the wounded, along with a woman and her two children from Greece. A Hong Kong citizen suffered minor injuries, as did one American. Here is what we know about the victims so far: Catalan police say a third person has been arrested. The suspect was detained in Ripoll, about 96km (60 miles) north of Barcelona, where one of the two men already in custody, Driss Oukabir, was arrested on Thursday. Stephen Burgen reports from Barcelona: There were reports on Thursday afternoon that a car drove through a roadblock on the Avinguda Diagonal in the south of the city, injuring one police officer. The incident took place at at 19.45, around two hours and 20 minutes after the attack in Las Ramblas. It was reported shortly afterwards that the car was intercepted a few kilometres out of the city in Sant Just Desvern, where the driver was shot dead by police. However, in the early hours of this morning Joaquim Forn, the Catalan interior minister, confirmed that the victim had died of stab wounds and was found in the passenger seat of the car. The man, as yet unnamed, was the car\u2019s owner and has no criminal record, suggesting that the car was hijacked and the hijacker got away, although there has been no official confirmation. This is from the Guardian\u2019s Madrid correspondent, Sam Jones: Spain\u2019s El Mundo is reporting that postmortem examinations have already been carried out on the bodies of the 13 people who died in Barcelona. DNA samples have also been taken and dental examinations will follow. Cambrils A second terror attack has taken place in Cambrils, a coastal town around 120km from Barcelona. Six bystanders and one police officer were injured \u2013 two seriously \u2013 when they were reportedly deliberately hit by a car. Police officers then shot dead five suspects, some of whom were wearing what appeared to be explosive belts. Barcelona Authorities say the attack is linked to the terrorist assault on Barcelona earlier on Thursday, when a man drove a van into pedestrians in Las Ramblas, killing 13 people and injuring 100 more. The driver escaped the scene and remains at large. Two suspects whom police believe to be linked to the Barcelona attack are in custody, although neither is the driver. One is Driss Oukabir, originally named as the suspect, although he is reported to have told police that his identity documents were stolen before they were used to rent the van. A second van that was believed to have been used as a getaway vehicle for the Barcelona attacker was found abandoned in Vic, 80km away. Isis has claimed responsibility for the attack in Las Ramblas, but this could not be verified. Alcanar Officials are also linking the two attacks to an earlier explosion that destroyed a house in Alcanar, killing one person and wounding at least one more. Police now say they believe explosives were being prepared at the property. Alcanar is around 200km (124 miles) from Barcelona and 90km (56 miles) from Cambrils. Sant Just Desvern On Thursday, a shootout at a police roadblock in a town close to Barcelona left a man dead. Police said it was not connected to the attack in Las Ramblas. On Friday morning, it emerged that the dead man \u2013 the owner of the car \u2013 was not in the driver\u2019s seat and had in fact been stabbed to death. A hunt is now underway for the person driving the car to the roadblock. It is possible that this incident is also linked to the attacks in Barcelona and Cambrils, and the explosion in Alcanar. According to Spanish media, police have confirmed that among the 13 people killed in Barcelona were three Germans and one Belgian. No further details have been released at this stage. The French foreign ministry says 26 of its citizens are among the more than 100 injured in the attack in Barcelona. Eleven of them are in a serious condition, it says. The French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, will visit Barcelona on Friday. Between the attacks in Barcelona and Cambrils, and while police were hunting the driver of the van that ploughed through Las Ramblas, officials said a man had been killed at a shootout at a police roadblock in Sant Just Desvern, but said it was not connected to the terror attack. This version of events now seems to be in doubt. Catalan interior minister Joaquim Forn has said this morning that the man \u2013 whom police had identified as the owner of the car \u2013 did not die from gunshot wounds. La Vanguardia reports that the man in fact died of stab wounds and was not in the driver\u2019s seat. It says police are now hunting the person who was behind the wheel \u2013 raising the possibility that this man was indeed involved in the attack in Las Ramblas. Of the seven people (six bystanders and one police officer) injured during the attack on Cambrils, five remain in hospital. One is in a critical condition, two in a serious condition, and two are stable, according to emergency services. A view of Las Ramblas on Friday morning: Events began to unfold on Wednesday night in Alcanar, 200km south of Barcelona. An explosion at a house in the tiny town of Alcanar, the southernmost point of Catalonia, killed one person and wounded 16. Senior police official Josep Lluis Trapero said the blast was related to the van attack in Barcelona, and that those in the house were attempting to \u201cprepare an explosive device\u201d. Police said the blast was the result of an accumulation of gas, but did not release further details. Most injuries occured after firefighters and police officers were caught by a second blast while investigating the initial explosion. The hunt continues for the driver of the van who killed 13 people in Las Ramblas and injured 100 more. The Catalan interior minister, Joaquim Forn, said on Friday morning that the Barcelona attacker remains at large. Police shot dead five other suspects in Cambrils after a second terror attack in the early hours of Friday morning. Authorities say the two attacks are linked. Forn told local radio RAC1 early Friday: [It] follows the same trail. There is a connection. Both are also being linked to an explosion in Alcanar, around 200km from Barcelona and 90km from Cambrils, which destroyed a house, killing one person. Police say the property was being used to prepare explosives. What we know about those killed and injured Barcelona 13 people are confirmed to have died after a van was driven into pedestrians in Las Ramblas. Around 100 people were injured, at least 15 of them seriously. Two men have been arrested \u2013 including Driss Oukabir, who was initially suspected of being the driver \u2013 but police have now said neither man was behind the wheel. They remain in custody. Police are still searching for the driver. Cambrils Six bystanders were wounded, one critically and another seriously, in a second terror attack in which a vehicle was driven at pedestrians in an echo of the Barcelona attack. Police shot dead four suspects in the coastal town, around 120kms from Barcelona. A fifth, who was injured and arrested, has since died. Some were wearing what appeared to be explosive belts. A police officer was also slightly injured in the counter-terror operation. Alcanar Before the attack in Las Ramblas, one person was killed and at least one other wounded in an explosion that destroyed a house in Alcanar, around 200km from Barcelona and 90km from Cambrils. The cause was initially thought to be a gas leak but police now say they are linking it to the attacks in Barcelona and Cambrils. Catalan police are asking anyone with information about the attacks in Barcelona and Cambrils to contact them by email or phone: News broke that police had shot and killed what they called \u201cperpetrators\u201d in the coastal town of Cambrils in the early hours of Friday morning. Initially the circumstances of the police operation were unclear, although officials said they were responding to a \u201cpossible terror attack\u201d. Four suspects were shot and killed at the scene; a fifth was injured and arrested but later died. It then emerged that the five are believed to have driven a vehicle \u2013 reportedly an Audi A3 \u2013 into pedestrians on Cambrils\u2019 seafront, close to the Club N\u00e0utic (yacht club). Six bystanders and one police officer were wounded. The officer was only lightly injured, but two of the others are said by health authorities to be in a serious condition. Police have confirmed that some of the five suspects appeared to be wearing explosive belts, and specialist bomb disposal teams were brought in. Australia\u2019s foreign minister, Julie Bishop, has just confirmed that four Australians were injured in the attack in Barcelona. Two men, including one who was hit by the van, have been treated in hospital and released. Three have received consular support but one remains unaccounted for, she says. There are no reports that Australians were caught up in the second attack at Cambrils, or the earlier house explosion at Alcanar. A second terror attack has taken place in Cambrils, a coastal town around 120km from Barcelona. Six bystanders and one police officer were injured \u2013 two seriously \u2013 when they were reportedly deliberately hit by a car. Police officers then shot dead five suspects, some of whom were wearing what appeared to be explosive belts. Authorities say the attack is linked to the terrorist assault on Barcelona earlier on Thursday, when a man drove a van into pedestrians in Las Ramblas, killing 13 people and injuring 100 more. The driver escaped the scene and a police manhunt for him continues. Two suspects whom police believe to be linked to the Barcelona attack are in custody, although neither is the driver.

          "bodyText": "Hyeon Soo Lim, the Canadian pastor freed by North Korea this week, is believed to have arrived in Japan on a rare flight from Pyongyang international airport. The flight was scheduled to leave the North Korean capital at 9.25am local time (0155 GMT) and was bound for the US air force base in Yokota, near Tokyo, according to NK News. The website published a tweeted photograph displaying the flight\u2019s details from the departures hall of Pyongyang\u2019s Sunan international airport. It quoted the person who took the photograph as saying that the flight, which had no number, was carrying Lim, who was released on Wednesday by North Korea on humanitarian grounds. The source, who wished to remain anonymous, described it as a \u201cspecial unchartered flight bound for Japan\u201d, with which North Korea has no commercial aviation ties. It would have been possible for Lim to undergo health checks at Yokota before continuing his journey home to Canada. Yokota airbase and the Canadian embassy in Tokyo declined to confirm the flight had been arranged when contacted by the Guardian. According to media reports, Otto Warmbier, the American college student who died in June, days after being released by North Korea, was flown from Pyongyang to another US military base in Japan, on the country\u2019s northernmost island of Hokkaido. North Korea\u2019s official KCNA news agency reported that a Canadian delegation had left the country on Thursday, according to NK News. In addition, a Twitter account monitoring civilian and military flight showed data indicating that a Royal Canadian air force plane had taken off from Yokota on Thursday afternoon. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, confirmed that Lim had been released and would \u201csoon be reunited with his family and friends in Canada\u201d. A Canadian delegation, led by the country\u2019s national security adviser, Daniel Jean, took up Lim\u2019s case after arriving in North Korea earlier in the week. Sweden\u2019s embassy in Pyongyang, which represents several western nations in North Korea, also helped finalise his release. \u201cPastor Lim\u2019s health and wellbeing remain of utmost importance to the government of Canada, and we are working to ensure that he receives any required medical attention,\u201d Trudeau said in a statement. \u201cOperational security considerations prevent us from discussing the matter further.\u201d Lim, 61, had been sentenced to hard labour for life in December 2015 after North Korea accused him of attempting to overthrow the regime. He was freed on \u201csick bail from the humanitarian viewpoint\u201d, according to KCNA. He is expected to return to Canada later on Thursday and will be taken to hospital on arrival at his wife\u2019s request, a source told Reuters. His family said they were anxious to be reunited with him. \u201cWe are relieved to hear that Reverend Lim is on his way home to finally reunite with his family and meet his grand daughter for the first time,\u201d the family said in a statement. They thanked Canadian officials for their efforts and noted that the ambassador and staff at the Swedish embassy in Pyongyang had played a \u201ccritical role in securing his release\u201d They asked the media for privacy as Lim reconnects with his loved ones and receives medical attention. \u201cThere is a long way to go in terms of Reverend Lim\u2019s healing,\u201d they said. Lim told CNN last year he spent his days in prison digging holes. \u201cI wasn\u2019t originally a labourer so the labour was hard at first,\u201d he said. Pyongyang views foreign missionaries with deep suspicion, though it allows some to undertake humanitarian work. A number of Christian missionaries \u2013 mostly ethnic Koreans who are US citizens \u2013 have been arrested in the past, with some only allowed to return home after intervention by high-profile US political figures.

Since 2001, when the Nato alliance set about invading the country, an estimated $1.5bn (\u00a31bn) has been directed toward women\u2019s programmes in the country. The funds have been given to schools, women\u2019s shelters, health programmes \u2013 in sum, to any and every kind of scheme that could deliver benefits to women. Most, if not all of it, has failed to deliver any benefits to Afghan women. A <a href=\"https://unama.unmissions.org/sites/default/files/protection_of_civilians_in_armed_conflict_annual_report_8feb_2016.pdf\" title=\"\">UN report</a> (page 23) released earlier this year said that violence against women has risen 400% in the past six years.

But there are fewer cod, and seabirds such as puffins and terns are having trouble finding food as the species they prey on move north to cooler waters. The mixed effects of warming seas are described in a report from official monitoring group MCCIP that confirms predictions it made in 2006. The seas around Britain are heating by about 0.5C per decade. \u201cThat may not sound like a lot to us but it is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/28/climate-change-drawing-squid-anchovies-and-tuna-into-uk-waters\">really significant in terms of the biology and ecology</a>,\u201d said the MCCIP\u2019s Matthew Frost. Extreme tides and intense storms are also becoming more common. \u201cWhat stands out from the report is we weren\u2019t wrong\u201d in the 2006 projections, Frost said. \u201cWhat scientists were saying then is coming to pass.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2>Since you\u2019re here ...</h2> <p>\u2026 today we have a small favour to ask.

Justin Trudeau faced off against then-politician Patrick Brazeau in 2012 to raise money for cancer research. \u201cI wanted someone who would be a good foil, and we stumbled upon the scrappy tough-guy senator from an indigenous community,\u201d Trudeau has told Rolling Stone. \u201cHe fit the bill, and it was a very nice counterpoint. I saw it as the right kind of narrative, the right story to tell.\u201d The remarks were condemned as smacking of privilege \u2013 a typical comment from Twitter: \u201cSo \u2018privileged white guy beats up Indian\u2019 was the \u2018right kind of narrative?\u2019 Seriously?\u201d Trudeau\u2019s office responded by issuing a defence of his commitment to reconciliation and improving indigenous people\u2019s lives. * * * Sea change \u2013 More squid, anchovies and bluefin tuna are moving into UK waters because of climate change. But there are fewer cod, and seabirds such as puffins and terns are having trouble finding food as the species they prey on move north to cooler waters. The mixed effects of warming seas are described in a report from official monitoring group MCCIP that confirms predictions it made in 2006. The seas around Britain are heating by about 0.5C per decade. \u201cThat may not sound like a lot to us but it is really significant in terms of the biology and ecology,\u201d said the MCCIP\u2019s Matthew Frost. Extreme tides and intense storms are also becoming more common. \u201cWhat stands out from the report is we weren\u2019t wrong\u201d in the 2006 projections, Frost said. \u201cWhat scientists were saying then is coming to pass.\u201d * * * Since you\u2019re here ... \u2026 today we have a small favour to ask. More people than ever are regularly reading the Guardian, but far fewer are paying for it. Advertising revenues across the media are falling fast. And unlike many news organisations, we haven\u2019t put up a paywall \u2013 we want to keep our journalism as open as we can. So we think it\u2019s fair to ask people who read us often for their help. The Guardian\u2019s independent, investigative journalism takes a lot of time, money and hard work to produce. But we do it because we believe our perspective matters \u2013 because it might well be your perspective, too. If everyone who reads our reporting, who likes it, helps to support it, our future would be much more secure. You can give to the Guardian by becoming a monthly Supporter or by making a one-off contribution. * * * \u2018Walkie Talkie\u2019 changes hands \u2013 London\u2019s most notorious office building has been sold for a record \u00a31.3bn, somewhat fittingly to a company that\u2019s in the jarring business. The Lee Kum Kee Asian condiment group is the new owner, and many in the capital would probably welcome it if the new owner moved the building holus-bolus to Hong Kong. Apart from the Walkie Talkie\u2019s sheer brash ugliness \u2013 a \u201cbroad-shouldered banker bursting out of a cheap pin-striped suit\u201d, writes architecture critic Oliver Wainwright \u2013 there\u2019s the \u201cdeath ray\u201d of concentrated sunlight produced by its curved facade, enough to melt the bumper off a Jaguar or blister the paint on a shopfront. A little detail the architect Rafael Vi\u00f1oly forgot about, despite having made the same mistake with a hotel in Las Vegas\u2026 Lunchtime read: Looking on the bright side\u2026 Was 2016 really that terrible? Is 2017 as horrible as everyone thinks so far? Yes \u2013 terror attacks, Trump, Brexit, Syria; the talented, beloved and famous dropping dead in droves; and myriad other depressing developments besides. But \u2013 global poverty falling below 10%, fossil fuel emissions levelling out, and pandas off the endangered list. Despite all the doom and gloom, we are actually holding a glass that is half-full and then some, according to the \u201cNew Optimists\u201d \u2013 a fairly loosely defined grouping of commentators who argue humanity has never had it so good. Oliver Burkeman samples their Kool-Aid. Sport England\u2019s cricketers showed more fight in the third Test at the Oval, digging in after a poor start to finish a rain-affected first day on 171-4. But if you want glory, then the English women\u2019s teams are the place to look. After the cricketers\u2019 heroics, the footballers are into the last eight of Euro 2017 following a 2-1 win over Portugal. The Scots, unfortunately, fell agonisingly short despite a 1-0 over Spain. Andy Hunter was at Goodison Park to watch Wayne Rooney receive a warm welcome back in the blue shirt of Everton as the Toffees stuttered to a 1-0 Europa League win against Slovakian team Ruzumberok. And with a week to go before the world athletics championships in London, sprinter Adam Gemili has spoken of his dismay at missing out on selection for the 200m. Business Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, briefly became the world\u2019s richest man when stock in the online retailer rose, boosting the value of his shareholding and pushing his wealth to $91bn. That put him ahead of Bill gates on $90bn, but the shares later dipped so he\u2019ll have to settle for second place for the time being. The fall in US tech stocks blunted buying in Asia overnight where most of the leading bourses were down. The FTSE100 is expected to fall 0.56% at the open. The pound hit a 10-month high against the dollar on Thursday and is at $1.308 this morning. It\u2019s buying \u20ac1.12 on the continent. The papers \u201cMANSLAUGHTER\u201d blasts the Daily Mail headline, below a qualifying strapline that explains it might be the charge levelled against the council and tenant body over the Grenfell Tower fire. \u201cCouncil could face Grenfell criminal charge\u201d is the Guardian version. The Mail also uses its front page to sympathise with Charlie Gard\u2019s parents, as does the Mirror with the headline: \u201cWe\u2019ve been denied our final wish\u201d. It is mostly a mix of Brexit news elsewhere. The Irish government effectively wants a sea border between the whole island and the UK, says the Times, because reinstating a land border between Northern Ireland and the Republic would be unworkable. But unionists won\u2019t countenance being cordoned off from Great Britain. The Telegraph says freedom of movement for European citizens will continue for a transitional period after Brexit \u2013 they will just have to register with the Home Office. The FT says Britain will seek a similar \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d arrangement to extend EU trade arrangements beyond 2019. City A.M. says the Libor rate for lending between banks \u2013 infamously found to have been rigged \u2013 is headed for the chop. The Sun covers a \u00a3400,000 robbery of John Terry\u2019s mansion.

Another said: \u201cTrudeau literally using indigenous people as political props.\u201d The encounter came to a halt in the third round as Trudeau pummelled Brazeau in a corner, but it marked the beginning of Trudeau\u2019s rise to Canada\u2019s top office. Brazeau \u2013 who told reporters after the match that it was his ego, not his reddened nose, that was most hurt \u2013 would later be cast out of the Conservative caucus following a 2013 arrest for sexual assault and domestic abuse. As Trudeau\u2019s description of planning the boxing match made the rounds online, some questioned how it squared with Trudeau\u2019s promise to repair the country\u2019s relationship with the more than 1.4 million indigenous peoples \u2013 many of whom grapple with rates of poverty, incarceration and suicide that are much higher than non-indigenous Canadians. Many continue to reel from the effects of Canada\u2019s church-run residential school system \u2013 described by last year\u2019s truth commission as a tool of cultural genocide \u2013 while systemic inequalities have left some living in inadequate, overcrowded housing with undrinkable water. Algonquin artist Jay Odjick pointed to Trudeau\u2019s comments as a possible explanation for the slow pace of reconciliation. \u201cCanada, your leader went to US media today saying that when he needed a villain to fit his narrative, an indigenous person was a good fit,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cThe sad fact is, WE are the only people he could get away with in terms of this. Think about perception if he had chosen another PoC person.\u201d On Thursday, Trudeau\u2019s office pointed to the launch of a national inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous girls and women as well as government promises for investment in education, infrastructure and healthcare to highlight the prime minister\u2019s commitment to Indigenous issues. \u201cHe has made it clear that there is no relationship more important to him \u2013 and to our government \u2013 than reconciliation with Indigenous peoples,\u201d a spokesperson for Trudeau said in a statement to the Guardian. \u201cWe are fully committed to a renewed nation-to-nation relationship and to reconciliation.\u201d The Rolling Stone interview \u2013 promoted on the magazine with the question \u201cWhy can\u2019t he be our president?\u201d \u2013 prompted intense debate in Canada. Many lauded the profile, which included phrases such as \u201cFor Trudeau, listening is seducing\u201d and sought to contrast Trudeau with Donald Trump. Polls suggest Trudeau\u2019s approval rating among Canadians remains high, at around 53%, 20 months after his government took power. But others reacted with skepticism, pointing to Trudeau\u2019s broken promises on electoral reform and deficit spending as well as his government\u2019s sluggish response in addressing indigenous issues. \u201cThis yearning for an anti-Trump to call their own means the US media are glossing over or ignoring the troubling similarities between both leaders, not the least of which is an obsession with celebrity that is ultimately counterproductive to governance,\u201d wrote Toronto Star columnist Vinay Menon. \u201cThe attention might be nice. But a bit more neighbourly honesty would be even better.\u201d",

          "bodyText": "The prime minister\u2019s bid to claim the \u201csensible centre\u201d for the Liberal party last week was more than an attempt to assert the Menzian moral ground in the internecine war that is fracturing his government. It was also an articulation of Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s moderate breed of politics in the face of the rise of populism to the left and the right of politics globally. The accepted wisdom of the times is that we are entering a period of political instability, of disrupters like Trump and Sanders, of nationalist isolationism in trade and security, in the embrace of the political outsider. If the fringes are in fashion, then centrism is the equivalent of a slicked down hair with a part. But as these populist experiments mature into real experiences of unstructured power, the lustre of the outsider may be beginning to fade. As this week\u2019s Essential report suggests, the public is surprisingly receptive to this message from the political centre. We think our political parties have become too ideological; we don\u2019t buy into notions of \u201cleft and right\u201d; we say we want them to meet in the centre; we would consider voting for a new centrist party if they don\u2019t. But there are contradictions here as well. Despite our reservations on ideology, just as many of us think the current political parties \u2013 with the help of the minors \u2013 are already representing the interests of Australians. Embedded in these results is also a clear message to our parties to work together for the national good. This can be read as a warning to the Coalition not to reject the bipartisan opportunity that is Finkel and perhaps also a repudiation of Labor\u2019s refusal to take the win on Gonski. Another reading of the findings is that they are tacit endorsement of the current leaders of both major parties who, despite their at-times bitter rhetoric, both sit closer to the centre than the fringe of their political traditions. Turnbull is routinely attacked by conservative commentators for being too progressive while Shorten, from the moderate right of the ALP, struggles to convince progressives he is the real deal. So, at a time when the populists at the fringes demand to tear the system down, Australian political centre is clinging on, albeit by its fingertips on the right. This centrism is also reinforced by a separate Essential report question where we are asked to rate various world leaders. It\u2019s the centrists like Canada\u2019s Justin Trudeau, Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel and France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron that we say we admire. As to the extremes, we can\u2019t see much difference between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, but neither rocks our world. (In a local context, both Turnbull and Shorten sit between Macron and Theresa May in favourability, and both closer to Putin in the disapprovals.) While the responses suggest thirst for moderation, I don\u2019t read these results as an endorsement of politics as usual. We know the public wants action from government on the issues that impact them: from energy prices to housing, from delivering marriage equality to supporting industry. People want government that can work sensibly to intervene when needed. But what these results also show is that we are not up for the extremists who would simply tear things apart, be it trashing climate science or beating up unions or politicising national security and immigration. And that\u2019s where Turnbull\u2019s London sentiments comes undone \u2013 because within a few days, he was back home throwing red meat to his Queensland base by singing the praises of coal in an attempt to keep his own job safe. Deep down I\u2019m sure the PM can see his own future: forced by his base to roll his own energy minister on a Clean Energy Target and driven to the election as the champion of the Coal Club, even as the public embraces renewables like never before. The sad truth is the centrism that Malcolm Turnbull so craves cannot be delivered by a government he leads. Too many in his party have fought too many culture wars and successfully deployed too many political wedges on their opponents to see the value in laying down their arms.",

          "bodyText": "Australian voters are resoundingly sick of their bitterly polarised politics and a sizeable group says they would consider voting for a new centrist political party, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll. The new survey of 1,830 voters found 71% agreement with the statement \u201cI wish both sides of politics would try to meet each other in the middle more often\u201d and 45% said they would consider voting for a new party that took ideas from both sides of politics. A total of 45% of the sample agreed with the statement, \u201cPolitical parties in Australia are too ideological.\u201d The latest weekly opinion survey has Labor continuing with a commanding lead over the Coalition on the two-party preferred measure, 54% to 46% \u2013 which is the same result as last week. With marriage equality once again creating tension within government ranks, this week\u2019s poll finds 61% support for the legalisation of same-sex marriage,and 26% opposition. Women are more likely than men to support marriage equality and young people are considerably more supportive of the concept than voters over 65. According to the survey, 81% of 18 to 24-year-olds support same-sex marriage, compared with 46% of over 65-year-olds. While the Liberal senator Dean Smith has signalled he will press ahead once parliament resumes with a private member\u2019s bill legalising same-sex marriage \u2013 a development that will trigger a discussion within the Liberal party about whether to move away from a plebiscite policy to a conscience vote position \u2013 the survey indicates voters are divided about how they would like the issue resolved. Of the respondents, 50% said they wanted a national vote that would be binding on parliament, 23% favoured a vote in parliament without a preceding national vote and only 9% want a national vote followed by a conscience vote in parliament. The voters most likely to favour a parliamentary vote, minus a plebiscite, were Greens voters (39%), voters aged over 65 (32%), university educated voters (29%) and people who support same-sex marriage (29%). With disillusioned voters breaking away from the major parties in increasing numbers, the Guardian Essential survey asked a number of questions seeking to ascertain whether Australian voters would be attracted to a new centrist political party. Thirty-seven per cent of the sample thought there was no substantial difference between the policies of the Liberal party and the Labor party \u2013 which perhaps explains the high level of frustration (71%) with the current levels of polarisation in the Australian political discussion. Half the sample indicated it was not tribal, agreeing with the statement: \u201cI don\u2019t personally identify with either left-wing or right-wing politics.\u201d There was one contradictory answer in the sequence of six questions. While 45% expressed interest in a new centrist party, a further 43% said Australia didn\u2019t need any more new political parties. Voters were also asked whether they had favourable impressions of several world leaders with different ideological persuasions. Respondents were most likely to have a favourable view of Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau (51%), German chancellor Angela Merkel (43%) and French president Emmanuel Macron (41%) \u2013 two politicians from the centre-left and one from the centre-right. Further down the pecking order was the British prime minister, Theresa May, on 33% support. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, had an identical favourability rating to the US president, Donald Trump \u2013 16% \u2013 and the North Korean chairman, Kim Jong-un, got the thumbs up from 6% of the sample. Coalition voters were more likely than average to have a favourable view of Theresa May (46%) and Donald Trump (23%). Labor voters did not differ much from the average \u2013 except for their low rating of Trump (9% favourable).",
