Trudeau provided no supporting data on Friday to back up his remarks, although his government set aside funds to study the widespread perception that overseas investors and speculators are to blame for Canada\u2019s housing bubble. Concern over the overheated property market has focused on Vancouver, where the proportion of million-dollar homes in the city has climbed this year to 91%. The figure marks a leap from two years ago, when around 59% of houses were worth a million or more, according to the study by Andy Yan, acting director of Simon Fraser University\u2019s City Program. \u201cThis shows how what used to be the earnest product of a lifetime of local work is perhaps quickly becoming a leveraged and luxurious global commodity,\u201d Yan said. The median household income in Vancouver, meanwhile, rose just 8.6% between 2009 to 2013, according to the most recent data from Statistics Canada. Adjusted for inflation, it would be about C$77,000 a year in 2016. That puts typical incomes well below the threshold needed to purchase million-dollar homes, said Yan, noting other factors must be driving the sharp increase in home values in Vancouver. \u201cIt\u2019s global cash, meeting cheap money, meeting limited supply,\u201d he said, adding that all three factors are working to \u201cmagnify each other\u201d and drive further speculation. Canada\u2019s central bank governor and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) both expressed concerns this month about the housing situation. Previous administrations have on five occasions since 2008 tried to tighten mortgage lending rules in order to cool heady real estate activity, but those measures failed. \u201cWe are all hoping to stabilize the market,\u201d Trudeau said, noting that any federal move requires delicate balancing \u2013 curbing price increases while not devaluing existing equity in people\u2019s homes, especially in markets that are not overheated. New construction and resale activity continue to grow strongly in Vancouver and Toronto, while Alberta and other resources-producing regions are seeing price and sales declines.

At least officially, most European countries deny paying ransoms, but in recent years <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/15/two-italian-aid-workers-freed-syria\">millions of dollars have been channeled to terror groups</a> to win the release of German, Spanish, Italian and French citizens. </p> <h2>Families affected</h2> <p>Still reeling from the news of his death, Hall\u2019s family said this week that they support Trudeau\u2019s stance. \u201cOur family, even in our darkest hour, agrees wholeheartedly with Canada\u2019s policy of not paying ransom to those who would seek to undermine the fundamental values with which my father lived his life,\u201d they said in a statement. \u201cWe stand with the ideals that built this country: strength of character; resilience of spirit; and refusal to succumb to the demands of the wretched, in order to satisfy the bloodlust of the weak.\u201d</p> <p>But in the US, some of the families affected by kidnapping expressed doubt over Canada\u2019s singular focus on ransom payments. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s terrific for soundbites and grandstanding and acting the tough guy, but it is really not a relevant conversation,\u201d said Debra Tice. Her son Austin, a freelance American journalist, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/27/austin-tice-us-syria-talks-missing-journalist\">disappeared in Syria in August 2012</a>.</p> <p>Some six weeks after Austin vanished, he appeared in a video being led uphill by armed masked men. His family has not since had any communication with Austin or his captors \u2013 and no ransom has been demanded \u2013 but he is believed to be alive and held by the Syrian regime.</p> <p>Debra Tice argues that official bans on ransoms are meaningless, because payments are inevitably made by hostages\u2019 employers or third parties. \u201cCitizens are still ransomed all the time because they work for a corporation that pays ransom. Or they work for an NGO that pays ransom.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"821abf5cd2a11189bdd879b94301c47c3dedaf28\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/821abf5cd2a11189bdd879b94301c47c3dedaf28/0_87_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Debra Tice, mother of US journalist Austin Tice, who was kidnapped in Syria.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Debra Tice, mother of US journalist Austin Tice, who was kidnapped in Syria.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joel Saget/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her comments allude to the industry of kidnap and ransom insurance, a flourishing trade amid the heightened risks of travelling or working abroad. Industry estimates <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/25/murky-world-hostage-negotiations-price-ever-right-insurance\">obtained by the Guardian in 2014</a> suggest that at least 75% of Fortune 500 companies hold kidnap and insurance policies, which at times result in ransom payments being made to criminal groups around the world. Exact figures on how often ransoms are paid are hard to come by, as strict confidentiality agreements are signed once hostages are home.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Citizens are still ransomed all the time because they work for a corporation that pays ransom</p> <footer> <cite>Debra Tice</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Abductees have also been released after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/15/two-italian-aid-workers-freed-syria\">intervention of wealthy individuals</a> in the third countries such as the Gulf states.</p> <p>The result is that little correlation can be drawn between governments that pay ransom and the threat of being kidnapped, said Tice. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have any effect on whether or not people are taken hostage. Frequently what happens, it has an effect only on whether or not people go home alive.\u201d<br></p> <p>A 2015 study from the Combating Terrorism Centre, an academic institution under the umbrella of West Point, found little evidence to suggest that <a href=\"https://www.ctc.usma.edu/programs-resources/hostage-project\">citizens of western countries known to pay ransom were more likely to be targeted by jihadist groups</a>. \u201cIn general, the data does not provide strong support [of] the idea of nationality-specific targeting among the larger universe of jihadist groups,\u201d the study said. It added: \u201cIt is interesting, that France, a nation often criticized in the media for paying ransoms, has not seen a discernible increase in kidnappings.\u201d </p> <h2>Ignores \u2018unimaginable pain\u2019 </h2> <p>Looking at the issue of kidnapping solely through the lens of ransoms is overly simplistic, said the family of Kayla Mueller, an American aid worker who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/10/family-kayla-mueller-confirms-aid-worker-killed\">died in captivity after being seized in northern Syria by Islamic State</a>, Isis. </p> <p>Mueller\u2019s parents Marsha and Carl said that focusing on payments, ignores \u201cthe far-reaching implications, the unimaginable pain and suffering of our fellow citizens and their families \u2026 as well as the political capital gained by terrorists that greatly exceeds the monetary demands for our hostages.\u201d </p> <p>An inflexible approach to ransoms hands over power to militants by instilling fear among citizens when it comes to venturing past their own borders, they said in a statement to the Guardian. \u201cWill we remain one of a few countries that allow terrorists to define our policies at the expense of our own citizens and our place as global citizens?\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"62e9ce2cbd6f6ef795aa623672ac60163fb8e72e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/62e9ce2cbd6f6ef795aa623672ac60163fb8e72e/378_0_3285_3285/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carl, left, and Marsha Mueller hold candles at a memorial in honor of their daughter Kayla Mueller.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carl, left, and Marsha Mueller hold candles at a memorial in honor of their daughter Kayla Mueller.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rob Schumacher/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In particular, they worried that the policy would be used to rein in the efforts of journalists and humanitarians. \u201cWithout journalists, will our news be only what our governments want us to hear? Do we really want to discourage individuals from humanitarian work and peacemaking efforts, relying only on governmental institutions that allowed this kind of emerging political and humanitarian crisis to go unchecked for so long?\u201d </p> <p>The focus on governments and ransoms also masks the fact that, despite the official guidelines, family and friends of those kidnapped are often doing all they can to raise money to pay the ransom demanded by captors.

          "bodyText": "His face drawn and gaunt, Robert Hall spoke directly to the camera. \u201cIt appears my government has abandoned me and my family in this endeavour,\u201d he said. A black flag waved behind him, amid the banana trees and lush foliage at the jungle base of Abu Sayyaf militants in the southern Philippines. The video, circulated last month, specified the price of Hall\u2019s freedom. And the C$8m price tag came with a precise deadline: 13 June at 3pm. Six weeks later and less than a hour after the ransom deadline passed, Hall was killed. Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, reacted quickly, calling the act a \u201ccold-blooded and senseless murder\u201d. His voice was firm as he added, \u201cCanada cannot and will not pay ransoms to terrorists \u2026 We will not turn the maple leaf, worn with pride by over three million Canadians abroad, into targets.\u201d He had uttered the exact same words two months earlier, after the death of Canadian John Ridsdel, beheaded by the same group of militants after a ransom deadline passed. While Trudeau argued ransom payments fund terrorism and criminal activity and set a dangerous precedent, he offered no viable alternative as to how Canada would save its citizens. His government \u2013 having lost two of its citizens to kidnappers in as many months \u2013 has now become the face of a global debate on whether governments should pay ransoms. On one end of the issue sit the governments of Canada, Britain and the US, all of whom have made very public commitments to resist ransom demands. On the other side sit countries with a more flexible approach, despite a 2013 agreement by western countries to end the practice of paying ransom. At least officially, most European countries deny paying ransoms, but in recent years millions of dollars have been channeled to terror groups to win the release of German, Spanish, Italian and French citizens. Families affected Still reeling from the news of his death, Hall\u2019s family said this week that they support Trudeau\u2019s stance. \u201cOur family, even in our darkest hour, agrees wholeheartedly with Canada\u2019s policy of not paying ransom to those who would seek to undermine the fundamental values with which my father lived his life,\u201d they said in a statement. \u201cWe stand with the ideals that built this country: strength of character; resilience of spirit; and refusal to succumb to the demands of the wretched, in order to satisfy the bloodlust of the weak.\u201d But in the US, some of the families affected by kidnapping expressed doubt over Canada\u2019s singular focus on ransom payments. \u201cIt\u2019s terrific for soundbites and grandstanding and acting the tough guy, but it is really not a relevant conversation,\u201d said Debra Tice. Her son Austin, a freelance American journalist, disappeared in Syria in August 2012. Some six weeks after Austin vanished, he appeared in a video being led uphill by armed masked men. His family has not since had any communication with Austin or his captors \u2013 and no ransom has been demanded \u2013 but he is believed to be alive and held by the Syrian regime. Debra Tice argues that official bans on ransoms are meaningless, because payments are inevitably made by hostages\u2019 employers or third parties. \u201cCitizens are still ransomed all the time because they work for a corporation that pays ransom. Or they work for an NGO that pays ransom.\u201d Her comments allude to the industry of kidnap and ransom insurance, a flourishing trade amid the heightened risks of travelling or working abroad. Industry estimates obtained by the Guardian in 2014 suggest that at least 75% of Fortune 500 companies hold kidnap and insurance policies, which at times result in ransom payments being made to criminal groups around the world. Exact figures on how often ransoms are paid are hard to come by, as strict confidentiality agreements are signed once hostages are home. Abductees have also been released after the intervention of wealthy individuals in the third countries such as the Gulf states. The result is that little correlation can be drawn between governments that pay ransom and the threat of being kidnapped, said Tice. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have any effect on whether or not people are taken hostage. Frequently what happens, it has an effect only on whether or not people go home alive.\u201d A 2015 study from the Combating Terrorism Centre, an academic institution under the umbrella of West Point, found little evidence to suggest that citizens of western countries known to pay ransom were more likely to be targeted by jihadist groups. \u201cIn general, the data does not provide strong support [of] the idea of nationality-specific targeting among the larger universe of jihadist groups,\u201d the study said. It added: \u201cIt is interesting, that France, a nation often criticized in the media for paying ransoms, has not seen a discernible increase in kidnappings.\u201d Ignores \u2018unimaginable pain\u2019 Looking at the issue of kidnapping solely through the lens of ransoms is overly simplistic, said the family of Kayla Mueller, an American aid worker who died in captivity after being seized in northern Syria by Islamic State, Isis. Mueller\u2019s parents Marsha and Carl said that focusing on payments, ignores \u201cthe far-reaching implications, the unimaginable pain and suffering of our fellow citizens and their families \u2026 as well as the political capital gained by terrorists that greatly exceeds the monetary demands for our hostages.\u201d An inflexible approach to ransoms hands over power to militants by instilling fear among citizens when it comes to venturing past their own borders, they said in a statement to the Guardian. \u201cWill we remain one of a few countries that allow terrorists to define our policies at the expense of our own citizens and our place as global citizens?\u201d In particular, they worried that the policy would be used to rein in the efforts of journalists and humanitarians. \u201cWithout journalists, will our news be only what our governments want us to hear? Do we really want to discourage individuals from humanitarian work and peacemaking efforts, relying only on governmental institutions that allowed this kind of emerging political and humanitarian crisis to go unchecked for so long?\u201d The focus on governments and ransoms also masks the fact that, despite the official guidelines, family and friends of those kidnapped are often doing all they can to raise money to pay the ransom demanded by captors. After a string of British and US hostages were beheaded by Isis, the White House announced it would help arrange talks and abandon its longstanding threat to prosecute the families who negotiate private ransom payments. As Robert Hall\u2019s ransom deadline neared, his family scrambled to raise what funds they could. They offered C$1.4m to the militants in the Philippines, according to Canadian newspaper the Globe and Mail. The offer was rejected. Years earlier, a similar scene played in western Canada as the family of Amanda Lindhout, a freelance journalist kidnapped in Somalia in 2008, tried in vain to raise the US$1.5m demanded by her kidnappers.

They want to connect to a regional infrastructure that works for them, not rail price hikes of more than 126% and endless delays to key transport projects such as the electrification of the line from Manchester to Leeds.

Here\u2019s an extract.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When Mr Cameron was touring Europe recently, seeking a better deal for Britain by sucking up to the leaders of such places as Romania and Hungary, I watched on YouTube an MEP called Daniel Hannan make an anti-EU speech to a group of, I think, students. It was brilliant. One of the best speeches I\u2019ve ever heard. And, I\u2019ll admit, it made me question my beliefs. But despite his clever, reasoned and passionate plea for us to leave Europe, I\u2019m still in. He talked sense, but a lot of this debate is about how we feel.</p> <p>In 1973 my parents held a Common Market party. They\u2019d lived through the war, and for them it seemed a good idea to form closer ties with our endlessly troublesome neighbours. For me, however, it was a chance to make flags out of coloured felt and to eat exotic foods such as sausage and pasta. I felt very European that night, and I still do.</p> <p>Whether I\u2019m sitting in a railway concourse in Brussels or pottering down the canals of southwestern France or hurtling along a motorway in Croatia, I feel way more at home than I do when I\u2019m trying to get something to eat in Dallas or Sacramento. I love Europe, and to me that\u2019s important.</p> <p>I\u2019m the first to acknowledge that so far the EU hasn\u2019t really worked. We still don\u2019t have standardised electrical sockets, and every member state is still out for itself, not the common good. This is the sort of thing that causes many people to think, \u201cWell, let\u2019s just leave and look after ourselves in future.\u201d</p> <p>I get that. I really do. And after I\u2019d watched Hannan\u2019s speech, that\u2019s briefly how I felt too. But, actually, isn\u2019t it better to stay in and try to make the damn thing work properly? To create a United States of Europe that functions as well as the United States of America? With one army and one currency and one unifying set of values?</p> <p>Britain, on its own, has little influence on the world stage. I think we are all agreed on that. But Europe, if it were well run and had cohesive, well thought-out policies, would be a tremendous force for good. I think we are all agreed on that as well. So how do we turn Europe from the shambles it is now into the beacon of civilisation that it could be in the future?</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-576293c2e4b02d7fb43eb299\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/severincarrell\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-16T11:57:43.501Z\">12.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon </strong>has again warned she could call a second Scottish independence referendum if the UK votes to leave the EU next week against the wishes of a majority of Scottish voters.</p> <p>Speaking during first minister\u2019s questions, she told Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale that if Brexit wins in a week\u2019s time \u201cagainst the democratically expressed will [of the Scottish people] that all options to protect our relationship with Europe and the EU will require to be explored.\u201d</p> <p>Dugdale asked Sturgeon three questions on the EU referendum, in clear breach of a ruling by Holyrood officials in May that as it was public body, the Scottish parliament was barred by purdah rules from debating the EU after purdah came into force on 27 May.</p> <p>Dugdale had asked Sturgeon whether the Scottish government had any contingency plans under way to cope with the economic damage that George Osborne and leading economists predict would follow Brexit.

In the corporate sector, this included a sharp decline in the value of commercial real estate transactions and M&amp;A, and reports of delayed business investment. Evidence from the Bank\u2019s Agents had suggested increased delays in corporate decision making, which was corroborated by a Deloitte survey of chief financial officers. Survey information from Markit/CIPS and the BCC showed that for a material proportion of responding firms the referendum was having a detrimental effect on business activity, sometimes significantly so. Regarding households, both car purchases and residential housing activity had declined, although it was difficult to isolate the extent to which these effects related to the referendum or a more general underlying slowing. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-576288ede4b02d7fb43eb255\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-16T11:15:43.871Z\">12.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Bank of England says pound could fall, 'perhaps sharply', if UK votes to leave EU</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Bank of England has issued a fresh warning about the impact of Brexit.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/news/2016/006.aspx\">In a statement confirming the latest decision taken by the monetary policy committee to keep interest rates will remain unchanged,</a> it says.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Bank of England says Brexit vote could lead to lower spending, lower investment, and higher unemployment.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>It says pound could fall in value, \u201cperhaps sharply\u201d.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>It says growth could slow, and inflation rise.</strong></li> </ul> <p>Here is the key quote.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As the Committee set out last month, the most significant risks to the MPC\u2019s forecast concern the referendum. A vote to leave the EU could materially alter the outlook for output and inflation, and therefore the appropriate setting of monetary policy. Households could defer consumption and firms delay investment, lowering labour demand and causing unemployment to rise. Through financial market and confidence channels, there are also risks of adverse spill-overs to the global economy. At the same time, supply growth is likely to be lower over the forecast period, reflecting slower capital accumulation and the need to reallocate resources. Sterling is also likely to depreciate further, perhaps sharply. This combination of influences on demand, supply and the exchange rate could lead to a materially lower path for growth and a notably higher path for inflation than in the central projections set out in the May <em>Inflation Report</em>. In such circumstances, the MPC would face a trade-off between stabilising inflation on the one hand and output and employment on the other. The implications for the direction of monetary policy will depend on the relative magnitudes of the demand, supply and exchange rate effects.

Some identify Corbyn as the chief culprit. Recent polling showed that nearly half of the party\u2019s voters were uncertain of its position on the EU. This, MPs suggest, owes much to the Labour leader\u2019s limited enthusiasm for the cause \u2026 Yet there is no truth in the claim that the lifelong Eurosceptic is a secret Brexiter. \u201cI\u2019ve had private conversations with him. He is convinced that voting Remain is the right thing to do,\u201d a shadow cabinet minister told me \u2026<br></p> <p>But Corbyn is not the only senior figure blamed for the drift towards Brexit. <strong>Alan Johnson</strong>, the head of the Labour In campaign, is accused of \u2018low energy\u2019 performances.

          "bodyText": "Jo Cox, the 41-year-old Labour MP for Batley and Spen, was killed after being stabbed and shot in the street outside the library in Birstall, West Yorkshire, where she held her regular constituency surgery. She was pronounced dead at 1.48pm on Thursday. A 52-year-old man, named in reports as Thomas Mair, has been arrested. Mair lived locally and was known to have had mental health problems. There are reports that he had links to far-right groups. Eye-witnesses said he shouted \u201cBritain first\u201d as he attacked Cox, with witnesses described as a hunting knife and a \u201chome-made\u201d gun. A 77-year-old man who apparently tried to help Cox was also injured, although not seriously. Brendan Cox, the MP\u2019s husband, said his wife \u201cwould have no regrets about her life \u2013 she lived every day of it to the full\u201d. The couple have two young children. He added: I and Jo\u2019s friends and family are going to work every moment of our lives to love and nurture our kids and to fight against the hate that killed Jo. Jo believed in a better world and she fought for it every day of her life. Campaigning in the EU referendum is suspended. ChancellorGeorge Osborne eschewed his Mansion House speech on the EU on Thursday night to instead make a brief statement: The referendum is a great exercise in democracy. But the campaign has been suspended, on both sides, out of respect for Jo and her family \u2013 and for that democracy that she served. One of the virtues of our parliamentary democracy is the everyday accessibility of MPs to the people they represent. It\u2019s what makes the way we govern ourselves very different from many others. We believe in freedom, liberty and justice \u2026 Today\u2019s horrible events are an assault on all of these values. Rosena Allin-Khan, who last night won the Tooting byelection for Labour, discarded her victory speech to pay tribute to her colleague: Jo\u2019s death reminds us that our democracy is precious but fragile \u2013 we must never forget to cherish it. Allin-Khan should have become Labour\u2019s 100th female MP. Instead the tally remains at 99. This live blog is now closing. We continue to cover the aftermath of Jo Cox\u2019s death in a new blog here: Conservative MP Andrew Mitchell has written a personal tribute in the Telegraph to \u201cmy fearless friend Jo Cox\u201d. Mitchell and Cox together set up the all-party parliamentary group on Syria, he writes: At the time, her party leadership was against military intervention in Syria and mine was in favour, which meant the atmosphere around the issue was quite heated. But she was completely uninterested in any of that. She just wanted to do the right thing \u2026 It\u2019s hard to believe that someone so brave and fearless and fun is dead, but the hardest thing to think about is her two lovely little children. They would come in to Portcullis House for tea with their mum, and now she\u2019s gone. A study in the the Journal of Forensic Psychiatry &amp; Psychology in January 2016 examined \u201charassment and stalking\u201d of MPs, and made some startling conclusions. Of 239 Westminster MPs who took part: 81% had experienced intrusive or aggressive behaviour. 18% had been subject to attack, or attempted attack. 53% had been stalked or harassed. Both sides in the EU referendum will suspend campaigning on Friday as a mark of respect for Jo Cox. Both sides have cancelled all events for Friday. Ukip will not go ahead with a planned poster launch, Economists for Brexit scrapped a press conference, and many Labour MPs are too shocked and grief-stricken to consider campaigning. Some MPs have called for parliament to be recalled to allow colleagues to pay tribute to Cox in the House of Commons. Bill Shorten, leader of Australia\u2019s opposition Labor party, and his deputy Tanya Plibersek have issued a statement. The Labor family shares the sadness of all those who mourn the horrific murder of British MP Jo Cox \u2026 She lost her life doing something all of us in public office take for granted, and something our democracy depends upon \u2026 The British people, our oldest friends, are in our hearts today. The Times newspaper reports that police were considering extra security for Jo Cox ahead of yesterday\u2019s attack, after it says she \u201chad been harassed in a stream of messages over three months\u201d. The Times says a man was cautioned over the messages and they are not believed to be connected to her death. But Cox\u2019s death will no doubt cast a spotlight on risks faced by MPs and what can be done to mitigate them. The BBC\u2019s James Landale says: There will inevitably be another debate about MPs\u2019 security. Many are often subject to physical attack. But politics can\u2019t happen from behind a ring of steel. Jo Cox\u2019s death is not just an awful tragedy. It is also an assault on our democracy. Friday\u2019s Guardian front page is understandably dominated by the death of Jo Cox. The headline is a quote from a tribute made by her husband, Brendan Cox: Jo believed in a better world and she fought for it every day of her life with an energy, and a zest for life that would exhaust most people. She would have wanted two things above all else to happen now, one that our precious children are bathed in love and two, that we all unite to fight against the hatred that killed her. Press Association has rounded up some of the tributes from around the world to Jo Cox, the Labour MP who was murdered on Thursday. Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, led the tributes saying she was horrified by the \u201cassassination\u201d and calling Cox a \u201crising star\u201d. She referenced Cox\u2019s maiden speech, which celebrated the diversity of her constituency. Clinton said: It is cruel and terrible that her life was cut short by a violent act of political intolerance. It is critical that the United States and Britain, two of the world\u2019s oldest and greatest democracies, stand together against hatred and violence. This is how we must honour Jo Cox \u2013 by rejecting bigotry in all its forms, and instead embracing, as she always did, everything that binds us together. Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau tweeted a message in French and English: On behalf of our parliament and all Canadians, I offer my deepest condolences to the family and colleagues of British MP Jo Cox. Ireland\u2019s premier Enda Kenny announced that, in light of the suspension of campaigning by the Leave and Remain groups, he would not be speaking on the EU referendum as planned. He also tweeted: What an appalling tragedy. Jo Cox, a mother doing her public duty, her life taken away. My deepest sympathies to her family. The president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, offered his condolences after a visit to Finland. He said on Twitter: Repelled by tragic attack on British MP Jo Cox. My thoughts are with her family and loved ones. Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull said he was \u201cdeeply shocked\u201d. He added on Twitter: Our condolences, prayers and solidarity are with her family &amp; the people of the UK. The Twitter account of the Malala Fund, the organisation led by Pakistani girls\u2019 rights activist Malala Yousafzai, retweeted a comment from her father. Ziauddin Yousafzai tweeted a link to Cox\u2019s speech calling on Britain to help the victims of the war in Syria and said: May her soul rest in peace. Jo Cox left behind a legacy of love, respect &amp; peace. US secretary of state John Kerry, who was travelling in northern Europe on Thursday, said the attack was \u201can assault on everybody who cares about and has faith in democracy\u201d. Danish prime minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen called the killing \u201ca true shock\u201d. Several MPs attended a service at St Peter\u2019s church in Birstall on Thursday evening for Jo Cox. Labour MPs Yvette Cooper, Mary Creagh and Caroline Flint were among those gathered to remember their friend and colleague. Allin-Khan takes the seat with more than 50% of votes cast, albeit on a turnout much reduced since the 2015 general election (69.7% then to 42.5% today). Allin-Khan should have become Labour\u2019s 100th female MP tonight. Sadly, the number stays at 99. My colleague Ben Quinn has filed his report from Tooting: Allin-Khan increased Labour\u2019s majority in Tooting from 2,842 in last year\u2019s general election \u2013 when the seat was won by Sadiq Khan \u2013 to 6,357. Dan Watkins came second for the Conservatives in both elections. Among other candidates standing in the seat vacated by the London mayor were Esther Obiri-Darko for the Greens, who won 830 votes; and Ukip\u2019s Elizabeth Jones, who scored 507. Rosena Allin-Khan says she won\u2019t make a speech but only a short statement. She says her thoughts are with the family of Jo Cox: Jo\u2019s death reminds us that our democracy is precious but fragile \u2013 we must never forget to cherish it. We are all here in recognition of our democratic values. Richard Field, the returning officer, is about to announce the result in Tooting: Labour\u2019s Rosena Allin-Khan wins with 17,894 votes. Dan Watkins for the Tories was second on 11,537. Labour wins the Tooting byelection. Canada\u2019s parliament has observed a minute of silence in memory of Jo Cox, AFP reports: The gesture of respect was held at the opening of Question Period in the House of Commons, and was preceded by a tribute to Cox by opposition MP Nathan Cullen. \u201cA mom of two beautiful children, a friend, a dedicated Labour MP, a long advocate of human rights in Britain and around the world was murdered today,\u201d he said, fighting back tears. \u201cJo used her voice for those who have none, she dedicated her passion to those who needed it most. She harnessed her love even for those who [allowed] hate to consume them.\u201d Wandsworth council says the turnout in the Tooting byelection was 42.5%. A two-minute silence was observed at the count for Jo Cox. This is Claire Phipps picking up the live blog again. Clearly, in the wake of the day\u2019s terrible events, the result of the Tooting byelection has become very much a side issue. But a declaration is expected soon and I\u2019ll bring that to you here when it happens. That\u2019s it from me - thanks for reading. My colleague Claire Phipps is taking over now and will bring you the result of the Tooting byelection. Guardian columnist Polly Toynbee has written about the killing of MP Jo Cox in a piece headlined: The mood is ugly, and an MP is dead. This attack on a public official cannot be viewed in isolation. It occurs against a backdrop of an ugly public mood in which we have been told to despise the political class, to distrust those who serve, to dehumanise those with whom we do not readily identify.\u201d Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said: I am horrified by the assassination of British MP Jo Cox, murdered earlier today in her district in Northern England. By all accounts, she was a rising star. Her maiden speech in Parliament celebrated the diversity of her beloved Yorkshire constituency, and passionately made the case that there is more that unites us than divides us. It is cruel and terrible that her life was cut short by a violent act of political intolerance. It is critical that the United States and Britain, two of the world\u2019s oldest and greatest democracies, stand together against hatred and violence. This is how we must honor Jo Cox -- by rejecting bigotry in all its forms, and instead embracing, as she always did, everything that binds us together. My thoughts and prayers are with her friends, her family, and the British people.\u201d Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn paid tribute to the MP Jo Cox at an impromptu vigil in Parliament Square in London. My colleague Will Woodward in Sydney reports that prominent Australian Labor frontbencher Anthony Albanese called the killing of Jo Cox a \u201chate crime\u201d, while Liberal cabinet minister Christopher Pyne said it highlighted the vulnerability of MPs: \u201cIt just really underlines how careful we all have to be.\u201d Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull has also commented on Twitter: The Labour MP overseeing the party\u2019s polling day push in the Tooting byelection has spoken of how they found it \u201cextraordinarily difficult\u201d and momentarily halted their campaign after learning of the death of Jo Cox. Clive Efford, the MP for Eltham, told the Guardian: \u201cWhen the news came out and the announcement was made around five o\u2019clock everyone downed tools in the campaign but we realised that the process has got to continue and people gradually gathered themselves and got back out on the campaign.\u201d He spoke about advice given to Labour MPs in the wake of the killing of their colleague. \u201cWe have been asked to contact, if we have any concerns, our local borough commanders or the security at the House of Commons, but it\u2019s obviously difficult to know what to be concerned about until there is more details about what has happened.\u201d Additional police officers were on duty at the count centre in Wandsworth council\u2019s civil suite, where a two-minute silence was held in memory of Cox. Labour\u2019s candidate, Rosena Allin-Khan, was widely expected to hold the seat vacated by London mayor Sadiq Khan, who brought in a 2,842 majority for the party at the general election. Allin-Khan, a mother of two who is deputy leader of Wandsworth council\u2019s Labour group, is a junior accident and emergency doctor. Her campaign literature has made much of her mixed Polish and Pakistani heritage and her working class roots. Hundreds of people packed into St Peter\u2019s church in Birstall to remember Jo Cox in a service mainly of silence punctuated by readings, music and prayers. The bishop of Huddersfield, the Rt Rev Dr Jonathan Gibbs, told the vigil: \u201cShe grew up in this community, she lived for this community, she served this community and, in the end, she gave her life for this community.\u201d Friends, colleagues and people who said they had never even met Cox crammed into every pew, with others standing in all other available spaces. Among those who attended were many of Cox\u2019s Labour colleagues, including Yvette Cooper, Dan Jarvis, Rachel Reeves, Caroline Flint and Mary Creagh. Gibbs told the congregation: \u201cNone of us, I suspect, could believe the news when we heard it this afternoon. We still can\u2019t believe it as we come tonight overwhelmed by shock and grief and a tremendous sense of loss but, above all, in many ways, we\u2019re still numb.\u201d The bishop added: \u201cThere will also be great feelings of anger and hurt and pain. How we handle those feelings in our own lives and in our communities will be of great importance. We are now here for each other tonight.\u201d Times columnist Sathnam Sanghera makes a very valid point in this tweet: My colleague Ben Quinn is at Wandsworth town hall for the count following the Tooting byelection held today. Tim Roache, GMB general secretary, has given the union\u2019s reaction to the killing: We\u2019re heartbroken. Jo was a GMB member and a friend. She was a working mum who got up and went to work this morning, that\u2019s all. That she won\u2019t go home to her kids tonight is cruel and unfair. Our thoughts, love and condolences are with her family and friends. As her husband Brendan said, she\u2019d want us to unite against the hatred that killed her. We will. Sleep well, sister.\u201d This comment piece by Alex Massie on the Spectator\u2019s website has been getting quite a bit of attention online. Here\u2019s a flavour: Nigel Farage isn\u2019t responsible for Jo Cox\u2019s murder. And nor is the Leave campaign. But they are responsible for the manner in which they have pressed their argument. They weren\u2019t to know something like this was going to happen, of course, and they will be just as shocked and horrified by it as anyone else... When you shout BREAKING POINT over and over again, you don\u2019t get to be surprised when someone breaks.\u201d At the start of a US state department briefing in Washington DC today, spokesman John Kirby told reporters that officials were \u201cshocked and appalled\u201d by the killing of Jo Cox. \u201cOf course we offer our sincere condolences to Ms Cox\u2019s family and friends and all of the British people ... And obviously we\u2019re going to refer you to UK authorities for this, who we understand are already investigating this heartbreaking incident,\u201d he said. \u201cBut again, we thought it was important right at the top here to express our condolences for this terrible crime.\u201d The governor of the Bank of England has paid tribute to MP Jo Cox as a \u201cremarkable person\u201d who dedicated her life to helping others. Mark Carney had earlier cancelled a scheduled speech on the financial services sector to a dinner of City bankers in London after the news of Cox\u2019s death. In swiftly drafted remarks, the governor expressed his condolences and hailed the Labour politician\u2019s political and charity work. \u201cOn behalf of everyone at the Bank of England, I would like to express our horror at today\u2019s events in West Yorkshire. Our thoughts, condolences and prayers are with Jo Cox\u2019s husband, her two young children, her extended family and her colleagues,\u201d Carney said. \u201cWhile I did not know Jo Cox personally, I knew many of you did and that many, many more knew what a remarkable person she was. Jo Cox dedicated her life to helping others,\u201d Carney said, citing her work with Oxfam, the NSPCC, the Freedom Fund, international action to stop deaths in childbirth and her more recent role representing constituents in Batley and Spen. Carney added: \u201cI have no doubt that this spirit will remain undimmed and such progress will continue. The best tribute that this room, this city and the country can give to the memory of Jo Cox is to renew our shared commitment whatever our differences to promote the common good in the United Kingdom and the world.\u201d A man has been arrested in Exeter following an abusive call made to Ben Bradshaw, who is the city\u2019s MP. Devon and Cornwall police said a 37-year-old man was held for questioning after a call was recorded at the Labour MP\u2019s office at Westminster. A police spokesperson said: \u201cAn abusive phone call to MP Ben Bradshaw was recorded on his office answering machine. The office contacted parliamentary police and Devon and Cornwall police. A 37-year-old man from Exeter is in police custody for interview.\u201d Labour MP Ben Bradshaw tweets: The Labour MP Jo Cox, who has died aged 41 after being shot and stabbed in her constituency of Batley and Spen, in West Yorkshire, was a woman who in many ways represented the character and style of the modern Labour party. She was widely viewed as someone who could have been a serious player in the party in the years to come. Suspected killer Tommy Mair has two brothers: Scott Mair, 49, and a half-brother, Duane St Louis, the product of his mother Mary\u2019s second marriage with the late Reginald St Louis, who came from Grenada. Speaking outside his house in Dewsbury on Thursday, St Louis, 41, said he couldn\u2019t believe the news. \u201cI was watching Sky News and I recognised him in handcuffs on the ground. It felt like a dream. I just couldn\u2019t believe he\u2019d do something like that,\u201d he said. \u201cI phoned my mum and she was watching too. She tried to phone his mobile but couldn\u2019t get through and she knew something was up.\u201d Mair last visited his mother on Wednesday night to help her tune her TV, he said. St Louis said Mair had obsessive compulsive disorder: \u201cHe was obsessed with washing himself. He would scrub his skin with Brillo pads.\u201d He insisted his brother had never expressed any racist views and seemed fine having a mixed-race sibling. Neither did he have any strong political views that St Louis was aware of. Mair had been volunteering for the past few years at a school for children with disabilities, he said. St Louis said he had a good relationship with his brother, but that Mair would fight with Scott, his younger, full brother, from their mother\u2019s first marriage. Scott has spent \u201chalf his life in jail\u201d, said St Louis, while Thomas has never been in trouble with the police, he claimed. Jo Cox worked for Oxfam and Oxfam International between 2001 and 2009 in a variety of roles. The charity said in a statement tonight that she was a passionate advocate on humanitarian issues including the conflicts in Darfur and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Her commitment to humanitarian issues led her to become head of humanitarian campaigns for Oxfam International in New York in 2007 for two years. She also met her husband, Brendan, while working for the organisation. Max Lawson of Oxfam, who worked closely with her, said: Jo was a diminutive pocket rocket from the north. She was as a ball of energy, always smiling, full of new ideas, of idealism, of passion. She gave so much to Oxfam. She was an inspiring leader, really bringing the best out of all of us, always positive, always believing we could win, and always passionate for change. She was particularly brilliant at bringing huge energy to our campaigning around the desperate humanitarian crisis in Darfur.\u201d Oxfam GB\u2019s chief executive, Mark Goldring, said: Oxfam is proud of the role that Jo played in our work over a decade. Many of our colleagues remember her fondly. The rest of us followed her work with admiration. She never lost her passion for peace, justice and equality. Everyone is deeply shocked to hear the news. Our thoughts and sympathies are with Brendan and Jo\u2019s family at this difficult time.\u201d Flowers are being left in Birstall in tribute to Jo Cox. There are also tributes in Parliament Square in Westminster. Osborne: \u2018our values will prevail\u2019 George Osborne had been due to use his annual Mansion House speech in the City to step up warnings about the economic risks of Britain leaving the European Union. But instead he gave a short statement saying that next Thursday\u2019s referendum was \u201ca great exercise in democracy\u201d. The chancellor said: \u201cPeople are free in this country to live their lives as they choose and express themselves without fear. Society will protect their right to do so and hold to account those who disregard our laws. Today\u2019s horrible events are an assault on all of these values. But we know that these values, no matter how they have been challenged in the past, have always prevailed, prevail today and they will always prevail. For they are the values of Great Britain, our great democracy.\u201d The killing of Jo Cox has hit home \u201cparticularly hard\u201d on a day when voters have been selecting a new MP in a byelection for the south London constituency of Tooting, the acting returning officer in the area said tonight. The flag was flying at half mast over Wandsworth town hall, where candidates and their supporters were due to start gathering at the election count. The election was triggered following the election of the constituency\u2019s long-serving MP, Sadiq Khan, as London mayor. Paul Martin, the acting returning officer, said: \u201cThe murder of Jo Cox has shocked the entire country, and it has hit home particularly hard in Tooting where right now the community is in the process of selecting a new member of parliament to represent their interests. \u201cIt is our duty and responsibility to continue with this by-election, but clearly a very dark shadow has been cast over these proceedings. The flag over Wandsworth town hall is now flying at half mast and we will hold a two minute silence during this evening\u2019s count to reflect upon this awful loss. Our thoughts, prayers and deep condolences are with Jo\u2019s family and loved ones at this incredibly difficult time.\u201d Shuja Shafi, secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain, has commented: I am shocked by the attack on Jo Cox and saddened to hear of her death. Jo was known for her tireless campaigning for human rights and for the disadvantaged. Her campaigning meant that she positively affected the lives of many people abroad and here in the UK as well. She spoke up for the children of Syria and campaigned for migrants to be welcomed here. My thoughts, prayers and condolences go to Jo\u2019s young family and to her husband Brendan Cox, himself a good friend of Muslim civil society.\u201d \u201cThe MP murdered on the street embodied decency and a commitment to all that humanity has in common. What a contrast with her assailant and so much that is rotten in politics.\u201d Read more from the Guardian\u2019s view on the killing of Jo Cox, which it sums up as an attack on humanity, idealism and democracy. Mair\u2019s mother, Mary, said she was too upset to speak on Thursday, but her neighbours talked of their shock at the news. One woman, who asked not to be named, said Mair was a \u201cdevoted son\u201d who did his mum\u2019s shopping twice a week and would bring two carrier bags around on foot, before walking several miles up the hill back to his house. He had visited last on Wednesday, she said. She insisted it was \u201ctotally out of character\u201d and that he had never been in trouble with police before. She said he \u201cpractically lived in the library. He was obsessed with books. His house is full of them\u201d. Another neighbour said he saw Mair and his mother out in the garden potting plants together just last week. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has been joined in Parliament Square tonight by many MPs, some of whom entered the Commons last year along with Cox. He described her as a \u201cwonderful woman who stood for many things \u2013 human rights, peace and justice\u201d and said she was an exemplary MP. Her death was \u201cbeyond appalling\u201d, Corbyn added. The class of 2015 were grieving deeply tonight. \u201cWe mourn and we are suspending all [referendum] campaigning activities until the weekend as a mark of respect,\u201d Corbyn said. \u201cHatred will never solve problems. Jo believed that.\u201d Thanks to my colleagues Mark Tran and Andrew Sparrow earlier \u2013 Chris Johnston here with the latest developments on this tragic event. Jo Cox made her first speech in the House of Commons on 3 June 2015, during a debate on \u201cdevolution and growth across Britain\u201d. Jo Cox, the MP for Batley and Spen, has died after being shot and stabbed several times in her West Yorkshire constituency near her weekly advice surgery. She was pronounced dead at 1.48pm by a doctor with paramedics at the scene. A 52-year-old man has been arrested and police are investigating reports the suspect shouted \u201cBritain first\u201d, a possible reference to the far-right political party, as he launched the attack. Cox\u2019s husband Brendan issued a statement in which he said he \u201cand Jo\u2019s friends and family are going to work every moment of our lives to love and nurture our kids and to fight against the hate that killed Jo\u201d. There was a further attack on a 77-year-old man, who has sustained injuries that are not life-threatening. Terry Flynn-Edwards, who runs the Divine hair studio opposite the scene of the attack, said a man from a dry cleaners had tried to stop the assault. She said Cox \u201cwalked out of the library with her PA and he was waiting for her. He stabbed her first and this guy tried to stop him and then he shot her.\u201d Prime minister David Cameron called the death a tragedy and described Cox as a committed and caring MP. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Britain would be \u201cin shock at the horrific murder\u201d of the MP. Nick Gannon, 33, who lived two doors down from Tommy Mair \u2013 the man named locally as the suspected killer \u2013 knew him since he was 10 years old. \u201cIt\u2019s shocking. He were a quiet guy, you would not think it of him. He would cut elderly people\u2019s grass voluntarily. There were no reason to think he would be capable of something like this. \u201cHe was friendly. If you said hello to him, he would say hello back. He was not aggressive or anything. He wasn\u2019t frightening.\u201d Gabrielle Giffords, the US House of Representatives member who survived being shot in the head in 2011, has tweeted: Former Labour leader Ed Miliband is the latest Labour figure to pay tribute to Jo Cox: My heart breaks for the loss of Jo Cox and for Brendan and their kids. She was so full of life and joy. Words feel hopeless right now.\u201d He praised her husband\u2019s \u201cextraordinary dignity, love and compassion\u201d, adding: \u201cBrendan \u2013 we all stand with you and grieve with you.\u201d Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has issued a statement in response to the death of Jo Cox. This is utterly shocking and tragic news, which has left everyone stunned. My thoughts this evening are with Jo Cox\u2019s family - my heart breaks for them. Although I didn\u2019t know Jo personally, I know she was held in huge regard as a brilliant young woman, who had already contributed a huge amount in her time in Parliament, and today she was simply going about her job as a local MP. My thoughts and condolences also go to Jo\u2019s colleagues in the Labour party and to the many friends she had clearly made across the political spectrum.\u201d Tributes are coming not only from politicians but from charities \u2013 Jo Cox worked in the humanitarian field for many years. The interim chief executive of Save the Children, Tanya Steele, said: Our heartfelt thoughts are with the family of Jo Cox. She has been a great friend and supporter of Save the Children fighting for the rights of children here in the UK and around the world. As a member of parliament, she was an outspoken advocate for the children of Syria. At this terrible time, our sincere condolences go to Jo\u2019s husband Brendan, who was Save the Children\u2019s director of policy and advocacy until last year. Jo Cox made her maiden speech in June last year. The full text is here in the Yorkshire Post. In it she speaks with pride about her Yorkshire roots and discusses issues such as economic regeneration, the HS2 rail project and her commitment to the EU. Here is a flavour of what she said: Batley and Spen is a gathering of typically independent, no-nonsense and proud Yorkshire towns and villages. Our communities have been deeply enhanced by immigration, be it of Irish Catholics across the constituency or of Muslims from Gujarat in India or from Pakistan, principally from Kashmir. While we celebrate our diversity, what surprises me time and time again as I travel around the constituency is that we are far more united and have far more in common with each other than things that divide us... Businesses in my constituency want help to address the skills mismatch at local level which leaves employers with staff shortages and young people without jobs. They want access to reliable sources of finance, including a network of local banks. They want to connect to a regional infrastructure that works for them, not rail price hikes of more than 126% and endless delays to key transport projects such as the electrification of the line from Manchester to Leeds. Many businesses in Yorkshire want the security and stability of Britain\u2019s continued membership of the European Union, a cause I look forward to championing passionately in this place and elsewhere... I am Batley and Spen born and bred, and I could not be prouder of that. I am proud that I was made in Yorkshire and I am proud of the things we make in Yorkshire. Britain should be proud of that, too. I look forward to representing the great people of Batley and Spen here over the next five years. Gordon Brown, the former prime minister, has put out this statement about the death of Jo Cox. Our memories will be for ever scarred by this moment. Our hearts will always be hurt at our country\u2019s loss. Jo Cox was the most vivacious, personable, dynamic and committed friend you could ever have. Whenever you talked to her, the compassion in her eyes and the commitment in her soul shone through. Years of public service advancing the causes she cared passionately about should have been ahead of her. Sarah and I were privileged to work with Jo and her husband Brendan over many years and in her tireless efforts on behalf of poor and desolate children and mothers. She went to some of the most dangerous places in the world. The last place she should have been in danger was in her home town. People will say that this does not happen in Britain. This should not happen in Britain. And we must resolve that this will never again happen in Britain. My and Sarah\u2019s thoughts and prayers are with Brendan and their two young children Cuillin and Lejla this evening. They will have all our support in the difficult days ahead. For them and for those of us who were Jo\u2019s friends, this is a devastating day. And it is a devastating blow to our democracy. And this is from Sarah Brown, Gordon\u2019s wife. I am heartbroken. Jo had a truly remarkable spirit and passion that shone through in her work with Oxfam and with me on our countless campaigns for women and children. Jo cared about everybody but she reserved a special place in her heart for the most vulnerable and the poorest citizens of the world. She was fearless, she was endlessly upbeat and she reached out to so many to join her cause. Her mission was to make the world a better place. But above all else Jo had utter devotion to her husband Brendan and their two children Cuillin and Lejla. That\u2019s all from me. My colleague Mark Tran is now taking over. Brendan Cox, the MP\u2019s husband, has issued a statement about her death. He says she would have wanted everyone to unite \u201cto fight against the hatred that killed her\u201d. Today is the beginning of a new chapter in our lives. More difficult, more painful, less joyful, less full of love. I and Jo\u2019s friends and family are going to work every moment of our lives to love and nurture our kids and to fight against the hate that killed Jo. Jo believed in a better world and she fought for it every day of her life with an energy, and a zest for life that would exhaust most people. She would have wanted two things above all else to happen now, one that our precious children are bathed in love and two, that we all unite to fight against the hatred that killed her. Hate doesn\u2019t have a creed, race or religion, it is poisonous. Jo would have no regrets about her life, she lived every day of it to the full. David Cameron has posted a further tribute on Twitter. Here are some more of the tributes to Jo Cox from MPs and other British politicians on Twitter. Here is David Cameron on the death of Jo Cox. Here is a statement from Theresa May, the home secretary, on the death of Jo Cox. Here is the statement by Dee Collins, the temporary chief constable of West Yorkshire police. I\u2019m now very sad to have to report that [Jo Cox] has died as a result of her injuries. Before going into further detail I would like to express our deepest sympathies to her family and friends at this tragic time. Jo was attacked by a man who inflicted serious and, sadly ultimately fatal, injuries. Subsequently there was a further attack on a 77-year-old man who sustained injuries that are non life threatening. Shortly afterwards a man was arrested nearby by local uniformed police officers. Weapons, including a firearm, have also been recovered. At 1.48pm Jo Cox was was pronounced deceased by a doctor who was working with a paramedic crew that were attending to her serious injuries. This is a very significant investigation with large numbers of witnesses that have been spoken to by police at this time. There is a large and significant crime scene and there is a large police presence in the area. A full investigation is under way to establish the motive for this attack. There are specifically trained officers with Jo\u2019s immediate family who are fully aware of what has taken place and we would ask the media to respect their privacy at this very difficult time. Additional officers are working in the local community this afternoon and evening in order to provide reassurance and support to our communties. Clearly, as this inquiry is at an early stage and we have an individual under arrest, we are not in a position to discuss any motive at this time. We are not looking for anyone else in connection with this incident. And this is from Tom Watson, the deputy Labour leader. The whole of the Labour movement is devastated at Jo\u2019s death. We have lost a colleague so young who had much more to contribute to public life. She was our future. It is hard to comprehend how a compassionate, principled and beautiful person can be taken away from us so cruelly. It\u2019s even more devastating because she was doing what she did best - serving her constituents. We grieve her loss. Our love and prayers are with Brendan and Jo\u2019s family. Jeremy Corbyn has issued this tribute to Jo Cox. The whole of the Labour party and Labour family - and indeed the whole country - will be in shock at the horrific murder of Jo Cox today. Jo had a lifelong record of public service and a deep commitment to humanity. She worked both for Oxfam and the anti-slavery charity, the Freedom Fund, before she was elected last year as MP for Batley and Spen \u2013 where she was born and grew up. Jo was dedicated to getting us to live up to our promises to support the developing world and strengthen human rights \u2013 and she brought those values and principles with her when she became an MP. Jo died doing her public duty at the heart of our democracy, listening to and representing the people she was elected to serve. It is a profoundly important cause for us all. Jo was universally liked at Westminster, not just by her Labour colleagues, but across Parliament. In the coming days, there will be questions to answer about how and why she died. But for now all our thoughts are with Jo\u2019s husband Brendan and their two young children. They will grow up without their mum, but can be immensely proud of what she did, what she achieved and what she stood for. We send them our deepest condolences. We have lost a much loved colleague, a real talent and a dedicated campaigner for social justice and peace. But they have lost a wife and a mother, and our hearts go out to them. Dee Collins says the police think this was a lone incident. But high-visibility patrols are in the area. And prominent individuals are being briefed, she says. Dee Collins says the police are attending a number of scenes. Q: Have you got the weapons? Dee Collins says some weapons have been recovered. Q: What can you say about reports the man shouted \u201cBritain First\u201d? Dee Collins says she is not able to say at present. But the police want witnesses to come forward. Q: Had Jo ever expressed worry about safety at her surgeries? Not to my knowledge, says Burns-Williamson. Mark Burns-Williamson, the West Yorkshire police and crime commissioner, expresses his condolences to Cox\u2019s family. He says this was a localised incident. Dee Collins says another person, a 77-year-old man, was attacked. Jo Cox was declared dead by a doctor at the scene, she says. She says the area is a crime scene and a full investigation is taking place. She asks the media to respect the privacy of the victims\u2019 family. The inquiry is at an early stage, and an individual is under arrest. The police are not able to discuss motives at this time, she says. Dee Collins, the temporary chief constable of West Yorkshire police, announces that Jo Cox has died. West Yorkshire police are due to hold a press conference about the attack on Jo Cox shortly. Here are some more MPs expressing support for Jo Cox on Twitter. There was police activity shortly after the attack at a semi-detached house on the Fieldhead estate in Birstall. Thomas Mair, 52, is the registered occupier of the address, according to the electoral roll, Vikram Dodd, Nazia Parveen and Robert Booth report. A police cordon surrounded the house as a helicopter circled overheard and forensic officers in boiler suits appeared to be searching the neat front garden, as well as around garages at the back of the well-maintained property. Neighbours on the Fieldhead estate said the man had lived here 40 years with a female relative, who died a number of years ago, leaving him alone. Kathleen Cooke, 62, said she and her daughter, Emma John, 30, had seen Mair half an hour before the attack. \u201cI looked out of the window at about 12.30 and he walked past a carrying his bag, wearing a cap. He looked perfectly calm and normal,\u201d said John. \u201cHe was a quiet person, kept himself to himself. We knew him around here from when he used to do our gardens,\u201d said Cooke. One woman, who gave her name just as Karen, said Mair did her mother\u2019s garden regularly until a few years ago. He didn\u2019t seem to have a job, she said. Local teenagers said he was a quiet man unless they congregated on the wall behind his house, which he didn\u2019t like. \u201cHe\u2019d shout at us,\u201d said a 17-year-old. \u201cAll this we are hearing now is totally at odds with the man we thought we knew,\u201d said one neighbour. \u201cWe knew him as someone who helped out, who did volunteering.\u201d Local resident Sam Watson told the BBC that people from nearby shops rushed to help. He said: We were outside there and then we heard loads of screaming and then we looked down the corner. There were a woman lying behind a red car. And then when we looked over the road, some of the Sandwich and Co, from another sandwich shop across the road, were getting another man that was injured and bringing him into their shop. And then the guy had a black hat on, and he was just casually walking away. He weren\u2019t running - he was just walking. He walked up through the market. Enda Kenny, the Irish prime minister, has cancelled an EU referendum speech he was due to give this evening following the attack on Jo Cox. Here are some more expressions of support for Jo Cox from fellow MPs. This is from BuzzFeed\u2019s Emily Ashton. The MP for Batley and Spen is in a critical condition after being shot and stabbed several times in her West Yorkshire constituency. Witnesses said the attack occurred after the MP became involved in an altercation involving two men near her weekly advice surgery. A Labour source confirmed Cox was shot and stabbed after she had concluded the drop-in session for constituents at about 1pm. Cox suffered \u201cserious injuries and is in a critical condition\u201d. She was taken by helicopter to Leeds general infirmary. Police also confirmed a man in his late 40s to early 50s nearby suffered slight injuries in the incident. A 52-year-old man is under arrest. Police are also investigating reports the suspect shouted \u201cBritain first\u201d, a possible reference to the far-right political party, as he launched the attack. A witness Hithem Ben Abdallah, 56, who was in the cafe next door to the library shortly after 1pm, said the MP was involved in an argument between two men. He told PA a man in a baseball cap \u201csuddenly pulled a gun from his bag\u201d and after a brief scuffle with another man the MP became involved. \u201cHe was fighting with her and wrestling with her and then the gun went off twice and then she fell between two cars and I came and saw her bleeding on the floor.\u201d The whole incident lasted about 15 to 20 minutes, Abdallah said. Another witness, Clarke Rothwell, who runs a nearby cafe, told the BBC he believed the MP had been shot and stabbed multiple times. He said: \u201cThree times she was shot, the initial time which then she dropped to the floor and two more times. The third time he got close proximity he shot her round the head area. In the meantime he was stabbing her as well, he was stabbing her with his knife.\u201d A police spokesman said officers were called at 12.53 to Market Street, Birstall, \u201cwhere a woman in her 40s had suffered serious injuries and is in a critical condition\u201d. He added: \u201cA man in his late 40s to early 50s nearby also suffered slight injuries. Armed officers attended and a 52-year-old man was arrested in the area.\u201d The acting Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy has tweeted about the attack on Jo Cox. This translates as: I condemn the terrible attack on the British representative Jo Cox. Violence has no place in democracy. I hope for her recovery. MR This is from Ireland\u2019s foreign affairs minister, Charlie Flanagan. The fact that Ms Cox was attacked in this vicious way in the course of carrying out her duties for her constituents is deeply shocking. The suspension of the remain and leave campaigns for today is an apt recognition that today\u2019s horrific incident was an attack, not just on Ms Cox personally, but on the practice of democratic politics. Nick Clegg, a longtime friend of Jo Cox\u2019s, said his thoughts were with her and her family, friends and colleagues. I am deeply shocked as someone who knows Jo. She is a lovely decent person, full of goodwill to everybody. My heart goes out to her and everybody affected. But also it is such a vile affront to our democracy. One of the great things about our democracy is that anybody can just wander in and see their MP in their weekly surgeries. That violence against Jo, although that is the most important thing \u2026 is also violence against our democratic values and very proud democratic traditions. And this is from the Scottish Labour leader, Kezia Dugdale. What is clear is that Jo Cox was attacked doing what politicians do most days when they are out-with parliament \u2013 holding a constituency surgery. To be attacked like that is deeply alarming and very concerning. Jo is a very active, good MP, everybody will be very concerned about her health. We are collectively hoping and praying she is going to pull through. Jo Cox\u2019s fellow Labour MP Alison McGovern said: \u201cJo brought her dedication and her passion both for her home town and for the causes she had fought for all her life to parliament.\u201d She added that the kind of detailed, knowledgeable parliamentary questions asked by Cox underlined the fact that she used her expertise, including on development issues, to hold the government to account. She\u2019s that kind of clever, brilliant, committed person who uses parliament to stand up for the people in the world who most need us. Brendan Cox, Jo\u2019s husband, has posted this picture of her on Twitter within the last few minutes. Terry Flynn-Edwards, who runs the Divine hair studio, opposite the scene of the attack, said a man from the dry cleaners had tried to stop the attack. She said: \u201cShe walked out of the library with her PA and he was waiting for her. He stabbed her first and this guy tried to stop him and then he shot her.\u201d Jayda Fransen, deputy leader of Britain First, said the party was \u201clooking into the reports right now\u201d. \u201cWe were extremely shocked to see these reports and we are keen to confirm them, because of course at the moment it is hearsay,\u201d she said. \u201cThis has just been brought to our attention. This is absolutely not the kind of behaviour we would condone.\u201d Police are also investigating reports the suspect shouted \u201cBritain First\u201d, a possible reference to the far-right political party, as he launched the attack, Vikram Dodd, Nazia Parveen and Robert Booth report. Graeme Howard, 38, who lives in nearby Bond Street, told the Guardian he heard the man shout \u201cBritain First\u201d before the shooting and during the arrest. Police were understood to be talking to at least one witness who claimed to have heard the attacker shout words about the rightwing group, and the motivation for the incident will form part of their inquiry. \u201cI heard the shot and I ran outside and saw some ladies from the cafe running out with towels,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was loads of screaming and shouting and the police officers showed up. \u201cHe was shouting Britain First when he was doing it and being arrested. He was pinned down by two police officers and she was taken away in an ambulance.\u201d And this is from Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission. This is from Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury. This is from Gordon Brown. This is from the Press Association. Birstall primary academy, which is a few streets away from where the shooting took place, said police had advised it to remain on lockdown, adding that staff and children are safe. Norristhorpe junior &amp; infant school, in the nearby village of Liversedge, said it was keeping children in school until they are collected by an adult, on the advice of Kirklees council. David Cameron has cancelled his trip to Gibraltar in the light of the attack on Jo Cox. This is from the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt. The Press Association has filed this profile of Jo Cox. In parliament for little over a year, Jo Cox has already carved out a reputation as a plain speaker and solid operator. Relatively young by political standards, Cox is due to celebrate her 42nd birthday next Wednesday, and has been spoken of as a future minister. Cox is a remain supporter in the referendum, and both official campaigns have suspended their operations as a mark of respect following the attack on her. The MP for Batley and Spen, who is married with two children, graduated from Cambridge University in 1995 and went on to be head of policy for Oxfam, and work as an adviser for former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown\u2019s wife, Sarah, and Lady Kinnock. Cox has been a vocal advocate for the victims of the Syrian civil war and is chair of the all-party parliamentary Friends of Syria group. The MP abstained in last autumn\u2019s contentious vote on allowing British military action in Syria, insisting a more wide-ranging attempt at a solution to the conflict was needed. Chair of the Labour Women\u2019s Network, Cox nominated Jeremy Corbyn for the Labour leadership contest last year, but voted for Blairite candidate Liz Kendall in the end. Cox later said she regretted helping Corbyn get on the ballot paper, and pulled no punches after Labour\u2019s poor performance in last month\u2019s local and Scottish elections. As the disappointing results rolled-in, Cox told the BBC: \u201cJeremy needs to personally recognise that this isn\u2019t good enough. \u201cHe needs to take responsibility, he needs to set out a route map to power in 2020, and let\u2019s rally first and foremost around the EU referendum. \u201cWe need to look very hard at what\u2019s gone wrong in the last eight months and put it right.\u201d Asked if she expected a leadership challenge, Cox said: \u201cNobody is talking about that now and I don\u2019t think it is the right course of action, but the clock is ticking.\u201d Cox was also an advisor to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and to anti-slavery campaign group The Freedom Fund before entering parliament. Despite growing up in the area, Tories attempted to paint Cox as a candidate \u201cparachuted\u201d into Batley and Spen during the 2015 contest because she and her family\u2019s London home was a converted barge moored near Tower Bridge. But Labour insisted the Tories suffered from \u201ccandidate envy\u201d as Cox was registered to vote in the constituency and would divide her time between West Yorkshire and the capital if elected. Cox secured a majority of 6,057 in the general election, and fellow Labour MP John Mann remarked: \u201cShe is one of the stars of the new intake.\u201d The BBC has been broadcasting this picture, which is believed to show the moment the suspect was arrested. Dozens of MPs, from all parties, have been using Twitter to express their shock at what happened to Jo Cox and to offer their prayers and best wishes. Here are some of their tweets. Witness Clarke Rothwell told BBC News there was an altercation between a man carrying a gun and Cox. He purposefully targeted her, said Rothwell, who runs the cafe next to the library where the incident took place. He shot this lady and then shot her again. He lent down. Someone was wrestling with him and he was wielding a knife and lunging at her. Three times she was shot. People were trying to help her. Then he ran off down a one-way street. Me and my mate drove round to try and find him. The Labour MP John Mann told BBC that Jo Cox was an \u201cabsolutely outstanding\u201d MP and that he was \u201ctotally shaken\u201d by the attack. She is one of the real stars of the new intake, not just on the Labour side but on all sides. She is hard working, eloquent, everyone likes her, she\u2019s one of the real stars of the future. Britain Stronger in Europe has also suspended campaigning for the day. Here is more from the Press Association from Hithem Ben Abdallah, 56, who was in the cafe next door to the library shortly after 1pm when he heard screaming and went outside. Abdallah said the weapon looked handmade and that the man who had been wrestling with the assailant continued to do so even after he saw the gun. He said: \u201cThe man stepped back with the gun and fired it and then he fired a second shot, as he was firing he was looking down at the ground.\u201d The whole incident lasted about 15 to 20 minutes, Mr Abdallah said and another bystander told him she had also been stabbed. He added: \u201cHe was kicking her and he was pulling her by her hair. A very courageous man from the dry cleaners tried to restrain him and he couldn\u2019t stop him because all of a sudden he pulled a gun. \u201cShe was a standing still target for him when he shot her.\u201d This is from the former Labour leader Ed Miliband. This is from Mark Goldring, chief executive at Oxfam, where Jo Cox was head of policy before becoming an MP. Oxfam is deeply shocked to hear the news. Our thoughts and sympathies are with Jo and her family at this difficult time. Vote Leave have suspended their campaigning today. This is from Boris Johnson, who has been on the Vote Leave battlebus. This is the scene of the shooting. Here is Jeremy Corbyn commenting on the shooting. These are from the BBC\u2019s Phil Bodmer. Jo Cox is married to Brendan Cox, a former Save the Children executive and special adviser to Gordon Brown. A Labour party spokesman said: We\u2019re aware of the incident that happened this afternoon. All our thoughts are with Jo Cox and her family. We cannot give any further updates at this time. The shopkeeper in a greengrocer opposite Birstall Library, Golden D\u2019Licious, said that he believed the attacker had been waiting for the MP outside the library. \u201cI was inside the shop and all I heard was a scream and then the gun shot,\u201d he said, without giving his name. \u201cI went out and everyone was dispersing. I couldn\u2019t see because it happened behind a car.\u201d This post has been removed while the information it contained is verified According to a Labour source, Cox was shot and stabbed after she had conducted her morning surgery for constituents. Another person, who has not been identified, was also injured and both were taken to hospital, the source said. The attack was said to have taken place sometime after 1pm. Here is the statement from West Yorkshire police in full. At 12.53 today, police were called to a report of an incident on Market Street, Birstall, where a woman in her 40s had suffered serious injuries and is in a critical condition. A man in his late 40s to early 50s nearby also suffered slight injuries. Armed officers attended and a 52-year-old man was arrested in the area. There are no further details at present. Police presence in the area has been increased as a reassurance to the community. According to the BBC, a man aged 52 has been arrested in connection with the incident. And this is from the Labour mayor of London Sadiq Khan. David Cameron has joined the many MPs who have already used Twitter to show their support for Cox. More on the shooting from Sky. This is from Cathy Killick, a reporter for BBC Look North. This is from Malik Walton, who, according to his Twitter profile, is a cameraman. More from the Press Association. Cox\u2019s assistant confirmed she had been attacked and said he was trying to get more information from police at the scene. This is from the Press Association. Eyewitness Hithem Ben Abdallah, 56, was in the cafe next door to the library shortly after 1pm when he heard screaming and went outside. He told the Press Association: \u201cThere was a guy who was being very brave and another guy with a white baseball cap who he was trying to control and the man in the baseball cap suddenly pulled a gun from his bag.\u201d After a brief scuffle, he said the man stepped back and the MP became involved. He added: \u201cHe was fighting with her and wrestling with her and then the gun went off twice and then she fell between two cars and I came and saw her bleeding on the floor.\u201d After around 15 minutes, the shop owner said emergency services arrived and tended to her with a drip. Jo Cox was elected to the Commons in 2015 as MP for Batley and Spen in West Yorkshire. Previously she had worked as head of policy for Oxfam. She nominated Jeremy Corbyn for the leadership but, as with some other MPs, that was in the interest of allowing him to get on the ballot paper, not because she was a supporter. She voted for Liz Kendall. A Cambridge graduate, she is 41 and married with two children. This is what the Press Association has filed on the shooting. Labour MP Jo Cox has been shot and injured in an attack in her constituency near Leeds. An eyewitness said the 41-year-old mother of two was left lying bleeding on the pavement after the incident in Birstall, West Yorkshire. The attack took place near the town\u2019s library where she held advice surgeries. Cox was elected to the seat of Batley and Spen at the last general election in 2015. West Yorkshire Police said: \u201cThere is an ongoing incident in Birstall\u201d, while Yorkshire Ambulance Service said it was \u201caware\u201d of an incident but had no further information. This is from Sky\u2019s Kay Burley. Jo Cox has been taken by air ambulance to Leeds infirmary, the BBC is reporting. According to the BBC, a primary school is in lockdown and a gunman may be on the loose near the shooting at Birstall. This is from the BBC\u2019s Allie Hodgkins-Brown. The Press Association has just snapped this. Batley and Spen MP Jo Cox has been shot in Birstall near Leeds, an eyewitness said. Britain Stronger in Europe has also condemned the Ukip poster. (See 12.01pm.) It has issued a news release with statements from MPs from four parties saying Ukip are wrong to exploit the refugee crisis in this way. This is from Yvette Cooper, chair of Labour\u2019s refugee taskforce. Just when you thought leave campaigners couldn\u2019t stoop any lower, they are now exploiting the misery of the Syrian refugee crisis in the most dishonest and immoral way. Europe didn\u2019t cause the Syrian refugee crisis and pulling out of the EU won\u2019t stop people fleeing conflict and persecution by ISIS and the Assad regime. All countries have a moral responsibility to help whether they are in the EU or not and the only way to deal with it is for countries to work together. We rely on other EU countries doing asylum checks and coping with this crisis long before it ever reaches Britain\u2019s shores - ripping up cooperation with the EU would make it much harder to stop the people smugglers, help refugees or prevent illegal migration. No country can cope with something like this alone. The other statements, in a similar vein, are from the Green MP Caroline Lucas, the Lib Dem MP Tom Brake and the Conservative MP Neil Carmichael. The Green party has condemned the Ukip poster (see 12.01pm) as \u201cdespicable\u201d. This is from the Green MEP Jean Lambert, the party\u2019s migration spokeswoman and a Remain supporter. This is a poster of shame from UKIP. Nigel Farage is deliberately confusing voluntary EU free movement with refugees fleeing from outside Europe \u2013 it\u2019s despicable. The European Union is the best place for countries to act in solidarity and work together on solutions to shared challenges like the displacement of people. It is vital we don\u2019t give in to this kind of fear and hate and that we vote to Remain in the EU. Back to the Ukip poster. (See 12.01pm.) On Twitter Connor Beaton points out that the image is similar to one he\u2019s seen on a Nazi propaganda video. And while we\u2019re on the subject of trust, these figures are worth flagging up in the context of the latest warning from the Bank of England. They show that, amongst Remain supporters, the Bank has a net trust rating of +34 (those who trust it minus those who don\u2019t). But, amongst Leave supporters, its rating is -45. Uh-oh. It turns out that, if David Cameron thought that wheeling out Jeremy Clarkson was going to help the Remain cause (see 12.48pm), the polling evidence suggests he was mistaken. According to these YouGov figures, Clarkson is even less likely to be trusted on the EU than Cameron himself. The only figures on this list who poll worse are Tony Blair and Joey Essex. One of the most senior figures in the Church of Scotland, the Rev Dr Richard Frazer, has said a leave vote would be a denial of the UK\u2019s moral values and its global humanitarian role. Frazer, convener of the church and society council of the Church of Scotland, which voted last month to restate its support for the EU, said Brexit campaigners were \u201cplaying a dangerous game\u201d by blaming immigrants, refugees and EU costs for the country\u2019s financial problems. In an article endorsing a remain vote in next week\u2019s referendum, Frazer, the minister at Grayfriars kirk in Edinburgh, said: The European project is far from perfect, but in as much as it has successfully replaced bombs with bureaucrats it has enabled European citizens to enjoy unprecedented peace, stability and opportunity since the Second World War ... To walk away would be a denial of the very humanitarian and moral values for which we stand as an active participant in global civil society. Unbeknownst to Boris Johnson, one of the Vote Leave activists at the fish processing plant he visited earlier (see 9.52am) turns out to be a former fan of the English Defence League. The supporter, who had an EDL tattoo on his neck, told the Mirror it was done years ago and he was not politically active before the leave campaign. Andy Reynolds, 47, said he backed Johnson\u2019s message, adding: \u201cThe fishermen have been struggling for years so it\u2019s good to see someone highlighting it now.\u201d Britain if it votes to stay in the European Union will no longer be a wallflower at EU meetings skulking in the corner but instead taking a new assertive leadership rule, Philip Hammond, the foreign secretary predicted today. He claimed a core group of a dozen like minded countries were looking for leadership from the UK and in the wake of a referendum Remain vote, the UK will have a mandate to pursue its agenda on competitiveness and the single market. He was speaking at the annual Chatham House think tank London conference at which many international diplomats and experts expressed deep alarm at the growing tribalism of international politics exemplified by the strong support for Brexit in the UK. Hammond said the last thing the UK needed to do after a Victory for remain is to go back to business as usual. We are the second largest economy in the EU and perhaps soon to be the largest. It is time we started to act like it. We have won most of the arguments about the direction of Europe\u2019s future travel and started to shape Europe in our image of the future. The days of the UK skulking in the corner \u2013 the wallflower at the EU dance - must be over. We must noisily and assertively fight for our interests and for our vision of the EU \u2018s future championing reform and focussing on the economy. Jeremy Hunt has claimed that the NHS would suffer \u201ca Brexit hangover\u201d if Britain votes to leave the EU. Speaking at the annual conference in Manchester of the NHS Confederation, which represents hospital managers, the health secretary rubbished as \u201cutterly bogus\u201d claims by Leave campaign leaders such as Michael Gove and Boris Johnson that the health service would receive up to \u00a38bn a year more in the event of Brexit. Any suggestion that the NHS would see a dividend from leaving the EU is utterly bogus. The Institute for Fiscal Studies are very, very clear about this, that even if the entire net contribution to the EU of \u00a3120m a week is handed to the NHS, you would only need to see a contraction in GDP of 0.6% and those benefits would be totally wiped out. Hunt was mostly preaching to the converted. No health organisation is backing Brexit and many, including the NHS Confederation itself, Royal College of Midwives and the Faculty of Public Health -- and this week the British Medical Journal -- are publicly backing the remain case. Here\u2019s a Guardian video with highlights from Gordon Brown\u2019s speech this morning. Spain\u2019s acting prime minister Mariano Rajoy said today that he hoped Britain stays in the EU but that he is unhappy about David Cameron visiting Gibraltar, the Associated Press news agency reports. Speaking on Spanish National Radio, Rajoy said his government \u201cdoesn\u2019t like the idea that Cameron should go to Gibraltar\u201d but insisted that what is being debated is whether Britain stays in the European union, \u201cas I hope it does.\u201d Cameron is making a two-hour visit to Gibraltar later today to seek votes to keep Britain in the EU in the June 23 referendum. Spanish media said it is the first visit to Gibraltar by a British premier in nearly 50 years. Spain ceded Gibraltar\u2019s sovereignty to Britain in a 1713 treaty but has persistently sought its return ever since. In the past, it has opposed visits by British royal family members to the territory. Gibraltar\u2019s 30,000 inhabitants are believed to be overwhelmingly on the \u201cremain\u201d side in the EU debate. They fear their access to the single European market could be blocked by a hostile Spanish government if Britain exits. Rajoy said Spain has always viewed Gibraltar as Spanish regardless of the referendum, adding that the campaign should be carried out in Britain not Gibraltar. Rajoy, who heads the conservative Popular party, is running Spain\u2019s caretaker government following inconclusive elections in December. Spaniards are to vote in a repeat election June 26. Jeremy Clarkson announced that he was backing staying in the EU in his Sunday Times column (paywall) in March. Here\u2019s an extract. When Mr Cameron was touring Europe recently, seeking a better deal for Britain by sucking up to the leaders of such places as Romania and Hungary, I watched on YouTube an MEP called Daniel Hannan make an anti-EU speech to a group of, I think, students. It was brilliant. One of the best speeches I\u2019ve ever heard. And, I\u2019ll admit, it made me question my beliefs. But despite his clever, reasoned and passionate plea for us to leave Europe, I\u2019m still in. He talked sense, but a lot of this debate is about how we feel. In 1973 my parents held a Common Market party. They\u2019d lived through the war, and for them it seemed a good idea to form closer ties with our endlessly troublesome neighbours. For me, however, it was a chance to make flags out of coloured felt and to eat exotic foods such as sausage and pasta. I felt very European that night, and I still do. Whether I\u2019m sitting in a railway concourse in Brussels or pottering down the canals of southwestern France or hurtling along a motorway in Croatia, I feel way more at home than I do when I\u2019m trying to get something to eat in Dallas or Sacramento. I love Europe, and to me that\u2019s important. I\u2019m the first to acknowledge that so far the EU hasn\u2019t really worked. We still don\u2019t have standardised electrical sockets, and every member state is still out for itself, not the common good. This is the sort of thing that causes many people to think, \u201cWell, let\u2019s just leave and look after ourselves in future.\u201d I get that. I really do. And after I\u2019d watched Hannan\u2019s speech, that\u2019s briefly how I felt too. But, actually, isn\u2019t it better to stay in and try to make the damn thing work properly? To create a United States of Europe that functions as well as the United States of America? With one army and one currency and one unifying set of values? Britain, on its own, has little influence on the world stage. I think we are all agreed on that. But Europe, if it were well run and had cohesive, well thought-out policies, would be a tremendous force for good. I think we are all agreed on that as well. So how do we turn Europe from the shambles it is now into the beacon of civilisation that it could be in the future? Nicola Sturgeon has again warned she could call a second Scottish independence referendum if the UK votes to leave the EU next week against the wishes of a majority of Scottish voters. Speaking during first minister\u2019s questions, she told Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale that if Brexit wins in a week\u2019s time \u201cagainst the democratically expressed will [of the Scottish people] that all options to protect our relationship with Europe and the EU will require to be explored.\u201d Dugdale asked Sturgeon three questions on the EU referendum, in clear breach of a ruling by Holyrood officials in May that as it was public body, the Scottish parliament was barred by purdah rules from debating the EU after purdah came into force on 27 May. Dugdale had asked Sturgeon whether the Scottish government had any contingency plans under way to cope with the economic damage that George Osborne and leading economists predict would follow Brexit. The first minister sidestepped that question. And her remarks were conditional and cautious: Alex Salmond her predecessor has said explicitly he wants a second referendum within two years of a Brexit vote. Sturgeon is widely thought to oppose that since a host of opinion polls show independence after Brexit does not yet have a commanding majority. My colleague Anushka Asthana has made a film about the impact of immigration on the EU referendum. It last eight minutes and you can watch it here. With one week to go, and support for Leave surging, Remain are getting desperate. David Cameron has already wheeled out President Obama, the IMF, Angela Merkel, every living former prime minister, the Bank of England, the OECD, Jeremy Corbyn and God know who else - without much effect. So, understandably, it seems they\u2019ve decided to deploy the one secret weapon they\u2019ve been holding back - Jeremy Clarkson. Rather unexpectedly, Clarkson is a Remainer. Here is the Press Association story about the photocall. Jeremy Clarkson and James May have said Britain remaining in the EU is one of only three things they agree on. The former Top Gear presenters were speaking as they met prime minister David Cameron in the west London office of their TV production company. Clarkson said to the PM: \u201cIt\u2019s an extraordinary thing that James and I only agree on three things, which is sandwich spread is delicious, the old Subaru Legacy Outback is a good car and Britain staying in.\u201d During an informal talk with Cameron over cappuccinos in Stronger In-branded mugs and croissants, Clarkson added: \u201cI have not, with the greatest of respect, heard one politician say anything that\u2019s caused me to change my mind. \u201cThere\u2019s huge numbers that don\u2019t understand and get confused. Really, it\u2019s my gut.\u201d Clarkson has previously declared being in favour of Remain, saying it would be \u201cbetter to stay in and try to make the damn thing work properly\u201d. The minutes from the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee yesterday are here (pdf). They show that the Bank thinks uncertainty generated by the referendum has already had a dampening effect on the economy in some areas. The minutes say: Monetary policy summary and minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting ending on 15 June 2016 Measures of uncertainty had increased further over the past month, with the UK a clear outlier internationally. And there had been growing evidence that uncertainty about the outcome of the referendum was leading to delays to major economic decisions that were costly or difficult to reverse. In the corporate sector, this included a sharp decline in the value of commercial real estate transactions and M&amp;A, and reports of delayed business investment. Evidence from the Bank\u2019s Agents had suggested increased delays in corporate decision making, which was corroborated by a Deloitte survey of chief financial officers. Survey information from Markit/CIPS and the BCC showed that for a material proportion of responding firms the referendum was having a detrimental effect on business activity, sometimes significantly so. Regarding households, both car purchases and residential housing activity had declined, although it was difficult to isolate the extent to which these effects related to the referendum or a more general underlying slowing. The Bank of England has issued a fresh warning about the impact of Brexit. In a statement confirming the latest decision taken by the monetary policy committee to keep interest rates will remain unchanged, it says. Bank of England says Brexit vote could lead to lower spending, lower investment, and higher unemployment. It says pound could fall in value, \u201cperhaps sharply\u201d. It says growth could slow, and inflation rise. Here is the key quote. As the Committee set out last month, the most significant risks to the MPC\u2019s forecast concern the referendum. A vote to leave the EU could materially alter the outlook for output and inflation, and therefore the appropriate setting of monetary policy. Households could defer consumption and firms delay investment, lowering labour demand and causing unemployment to rise. Through financial market and confidence channels, there are also risks of adverse spill-overs to the global economy. At the same time, supply growth is likely to be lower over the forecast period, reflecting slower capital accumulation and the need to reallocate resources. Sterling is also likely to depreciate further, perhaps sharply. This combination of influences on demand, supply and the exchange rate could lead to a materially lower path for growth and a notably higher path for inflation than in the central projections set out in the May Inflation Report. In such circumstances, the MPC would face a trade-off between stabilising inflation on the one hand and output and employment on the other. The implications for the direction of monetary policy will depend on the relative magnitudes of the demand, supply and exchange rate effects. The MPC will take whatever action is needed, following the outcome of the referendum, to ensure that inflation expectations remain well anchored and inflation returns to the target over the appropriate horizon. Ukip has unveiled a new EU referendum poster. It is intended to make a point about immigration, but it uses a picture of refugees. Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister and SNP leader, has condemned the poster as \u201cdisgusting\u201d. Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, has been speaking to journalists on a visit to Russia today. He says Brexit would usher in a period of \u201cmajor uncertainty\u201d for Britain, the EU and the world. The Corbyn event is now over. I will post a summary soon. Q: John McDonnell said today Labour should look again at the free movement of labour in the EU. Do you agree? Corbyn says the EU depends on free movement of labour. He has set out plans for EU minimum standards. He thinks that is the way foward. Corbyn dismisses calls to curb the EU\u2019s free movement of labour rules. Q: [From the Telegraph\u2019s Michael Deacon] Why are so many Labour supporters planning to vote Leave? Corbyn says people do not appreciate all that the EU has done. He also says there has been a \u201csteady stream of anti-European sentiment\u201d in the papers. Sarcastically, he says he does not include the Telegraph, which he says only has Europe\u2019s best interests at heart. He says a fear strategy will not work. A positive strategy is needed. He says he has tried to set out one today. Corbyn is now wrapping up. I have tried to set out today some of Labour vision for Remain and Reform in the European Union. More importantly I hope I\u2019ve been able to restore a bit of faith in what politics can do. If you have a decent government committed to making our country and our world a better place. I encourage you all to vote Remain on 23 June and then to support our campaign for the changes we want to see here in Britain and across Europe. Things can and, with your help, they will change. Corbyn says Labour should be supporting moves towards a financial transaction tax (aka, the Tobin tax, or Robin Hood tax). There are currently 10 countries in Europe working together to secure a financial transactions tax across the European Union. This is a small tax on specific financial transactions to help prevent the sort of banking crash we saw a few years back, that led to the deepest economic crisis since the 1930s. What was the British Government\u2019s response to this proposal? To rush to Europe to oppose it, threatening legal action. Labour wants to help drive this reform, to build support for an EU-wide tax as a step towards a global tax. We must reform our banking sector and discourage the dangerous practices that undermined the banks across Europe and globally. The process is currently in a fragile state, despite the support of France and Germany, but imagine the impetus Britain\u2019s support could give to the campaign, both in Europe and among major economies around the world. Corbyn says Labour supports an EU-wide financial transaction tax. This is from the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg. Corbyn calls for new European standards on rights at work and minimum pay. I mentioned the scandal of zero hours contracts earlier too. As well as outlawing these exploitative contracts in Britain, we should go further and work with our allies to establish a European minimum standard of rights at work to stop undercutting and give people the job security they need. And now that Germany has introduced a minimum wage there is an opportunity to move towards a European-wide minimum wage \u2013 linked to average pay and the cost of living in each country to halt the race to the bottom in pay and conditions, and increase wages across Europe. Corbyn calls for an EU-wide minimum wage and EU minimum standards on rights at work. Corbyn is now talking about the posting of workers directive, which he has raised at least twice at PMQs. There is a little known EU directive, for example, called the Posting of Workers Directive. It allows companies that win contracts in another part of Europe to take workers to other countries. They can post their workers abroad temporarily, rather than go through new recruitment processes. But legal judgements have opened up loopholes meaning that these companies are able to undercut the going rate in one country by paying the going rate in another. In extreme cases it has meant workers not being paid the minimum wage of the country they\u2019re working in because it is above the rate of their home nation. This loophole can and must be closed and there is a proposal on the table to do so. Labour would work to secure agreement from other countries to back it. Corbyn says the UK should use its presidency of the EU next year to push for changes. There are proposals now in Europe for country-by-country tax reporting, which means that companies pay their taxes in the countries where they make their profits. Labour members of the European parliament have backed this plan every time, while Conservatives ones oppose it, time and time again. Corbyn says Labour wants the UK to remain in the EU, but in a reformed EU. Labour is calling for a vote to remain in Europe at next week\u2019s referendum because we believe staying in the European Union offers our people a better future in terms of jobs, investment, rights at work and environmental protection. But we are also campaigning for reform of the European Union because we are convinced Europe needs to change to work for all, to become more democratic, strengthen workers\u2019 rights, ditch austerity and end the pressure to privatisation. Corbyn says local authorities should be able to run local energy companies. Many of you from this part of South Yorkshire will remember that miners used to get free coal. In Denmark, Portugal and Germany today communities are setting up energy companies which sell electricity back to them at discounted rates. But ridiculously, it\u2019s illegal to do that here. We need to learn from the best in Europe. Corbyn turns to immigration, and he says he challenged David Cameron in the Commons yesterday to explain why he was not taking action to stop firms advertising jobs abroad but not in the UK. And if we want to stop insecurity at work and the exploitation of zero hours contracts that are being used to drive down pay and conditions, why don\u2019t we do what other European countries have done and simply ban them? Zero hours contracts are not allowed in Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, Poland and Spain. It seems we\u2019re the odd one out. Our politicians now in power are choosing not to tackle exploitation, but we will. Corbyn condemns the Tory record on tax avoidance and excessive pay. Does anyone here own an offshore trust? Do any of your family or friends own an offshore trust? So who was David Cameron standing up for when he wrote to the EU in November 2013 opposing proposals transparency into who owns these shady offshore trusts? From cuts to disability benefits and cuts tax credits, to tax breaks for the super-rich and corporations. We have a government making the wrong choices and sticking up for the wrong people. Or take another example, a couple of years ago, the EU also came forward with a proposal to restrict bankers\u2019 bonuses and what did George Osborne do? Again he rushed to Brussels within an army of taxpayer-funded lawyers to oppose it and he lost. Corbyn attacks the Tory Brexiteers, saying they have made bogus spending promises and that they are not to be trusted on the NHS. He criticises the changes introduced by the Tories in the 1980s and early 1990s. It was those same governments of the 1980s and early 90s that deregulated the labour market so that zero hours contracts could flourish and the share of wealth going to workers fell off a cliff. It is unscrupulous employers and politicians who have allowed temporary contracts, agency and enforced part-time working, and bogus self-employment to mushroom. So blame the politicians who opened the door to rampant job insecurity. Corbyn is speaking at the University of Sheffield Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre in Sheffield. He says he wants to try to restore some faith in politics. Not many people are grateful for the work politicians do. I don\u2019t have any difficulty understanding why, the political class has let our country down in so many ways, but today I want to try and restore a bit of faith in politics, and set out how politics done in a different way, can improve our lives and our communities. Politicians are failing to address the problems facing modern workers, he says. The insecurity of work the lack of good well-paid jobs, the high cost of housing, whether to rent or to buy, how we adjust to, and pay for, an ageing society, the failure to ensure decent economic growth in all parts of the country and in which we all share. That is the failure of politicians, not of the EU or of EU migrants for that matter. Too many voices in this debate are only playing that old trick the blame game. And when politicians play the blame game, it\u2019s usually because they have nothing serious to offer themselves. Jeremy Corbyn is delivering his EU speech now. There is a live feed at the top of this blog. Here are some more findings from the Ipsos MORI phone poll reported in the Evening Standard. The underlying findings are probably even more worrying for Remain than the headline numbers. That is because they show that Remain\u2019s key message - that leaving the EU would be bad for the economy - is failing to make an impact, because people don\u2019t believe they will be worse off. The poll also shows that, amazingly, people are more likely to believe the Vote Leave claim that EU membership costs \u00a3350m than to disbelieve it - even though it is had been comprehensively dismissed as misleading at best, or outright dishonest at worst, by just about every economic authority there is. This finding alone is devastating for the factchecking industry. They must be wondering now what\u2019s the point. Some 31% of people think they will be better off in five years time if the UK leaves the EU. Only 18% think they will be better off if the UK stays in. Immigration is now the most important issue in the campaign. It is cited as very important by 33% of people (up five points from last month), with the economy in second place (down five points). Almost half of voters (47%) do believe Vote Leave\u2019s claim that Britain sends \u00a3350m a week to the EU. Another 39% do not believe it is true. Some 70% of people do not believe George Osborne\u2019s claim that households will eventually be \u00a34,300 worse off if the UK leaves the EU. Only 17% of people do believe this. Even among Remain supporters, more than half think the claim is not true. Some 48% of people think the UK will be liable for future eurozone bailouts if it stays in the EU, even though David Cameron says the renegotiation deal he achieved specifically rules this out. Only 40% accept what Cameron says and believe the claim that Britain would be liable is untrue.= People are split 45%/45% on whether Turkey will be fast-tracked to EU membership - even though this is a claim that Cameron has also specifically denied. But there is little support for Nigel Farage\u2019s claim that staying in the EU would increase the risk of sex attacks by migrants. Only 28% think this is true; 62% think this is false. Some 59% of people do not believe Cameron\u2019s claim that leaving the EU would put peace and stability at risk. Some 32% do believe this is the case. McDonnell says the problems facing the world are international ones that require international solutions. The live feed has now gone down, but I will post some more from the speech when I get some words. McDonnell says the Leave campaign have taken the debate into the political gutter. He says some on the Leave side, including Boris Johnson, have decided where they stand on the EU \u201cpurely on the basis of their future ambitions\u201d. The Tory infighting has squeezed out the Labour voice in the campaign, he says. But he says it is now clear that the Labour family has come together and that it is united in campaigning for Remain. And it is important to stress that it would be a Tory Brexit, he says. A Tory government would use it as an opportunity to cut rights. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, is speaking now at the Labour rally. He says he and Gordon Brown last stood on a platform together in 2007, when he wanted to challenge Brown for the Labour leadership. This week is critical, McDonnell says. There are 10 or 15% of people who have not made their minds up. And there is another 10/15% who are not sure. So there is \u201call to play for\u201d, he says. He says the debate has not matched the importance of what is at stake. Sir Richard Leese, the Labour leader of Manchester city council, is speaking now at the Labour event. He says the EU has contributed to a new transport scheme in the city. There has been a revival in the great cities in Britain, he says. He says EU funding has helped to enable this renovation to happen. Brown says the EU has helped to guarantee peace in Europe. He talks about the way the EU cooperated when Eastern Europe fell. And think about what more the EU could achieve do deal with the problems facing the world, like hunger and poverty, if it cooperated further, he says in his peroration. It was a powerful end to a speech which mostly was a repeat of one that Brown has already made several times over recent weeks on the campaign trail. I will post some quotes soon. Brown says all his political career he has campaigned for jobs. And there is no route to full employment for the UK that does not involve EU membership, he says. Gordon Brown, the Labour former prime minister, and John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, are speaking at a Labour In for Britain rally in Manchester now. They are on opposite wings of the party, and McDonnell tried to challenge Brown for the leadership in 2007, although he could not get enough nominations to force a contest. But they are both speaking in favour of Remain. Brown is speaking now. He says Labour has been saying for years the NHS is under-funded. Now Tories are saying that. And Labour has been saying for years you cannot trust the Tories on the NHS. Now even Tories are saying that. A new Ipsos MORI poll for the Evening Standard gives Leave a six-point lead. Here\u2019s an extract from the story. In a dramatic turnaround since May, some 53 per cent now want to leave and 47 per cent want to stay, excluding don\u2019t knows. It is the first time since David Cameron pledged the referendum in January 2013 that Vote Leave have come out ahead in the respected monthly Ipsos MORI telephone survey, which is exclusive to the Evening Standard. And the Dutch seem to be keen on the UK staying too, if this is anything go to by. Mariano Rajoy, the Spanish acting prime minister, has taken to Twitter this morning to say he wants the UK to stay in the EU. According to Google, this translates into English as: The #Brexit would be a step backwards in the European process. We want UK continue in Europe and continue strengthening the EU #RajoyenRNE Boris Johnson was up early this morning to visit a fish processing unit in Lowestoft in Suffolk, where he once again denied having ambitions to be prime minister. Flanked by Vote Leave supporters, he held up a salmon and declared the EU was \u201cpinching our fish\u201d. Urged by one worker, John Knights, to become prime minister, he replied: \u201cNo that\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d Speaking outside the factory, George Eustice, the fishing minister and Vote Leave supporter, said he wanted to revert to the international rules that mean the UK would control fishing rights for 200 miles around the coastline. But he acknowledged a new deal would have to be struck to allow reciprocal arrangements with other countries, rather than stopping foreign boats coming into UK waters. \u201cI would see the reestablishment of international law as the starting point for a renegotiation of both access rights and quota allocations,\u201d Eustice said. Both he and Johnson claimed leaving the EU would help rejuvenate coastal towns like Lowestoft, while admitting it would not happen overnight. Christine Blowers, 63, a Vote Leave activist who had turned out at 7am to greet Johnson, said she would advise her grandchildren to move to Australia if the UK decides to remain. \u201cWe want another election. To threaten elderly people! We could be threatened but we are not because we\u2019ve lost everything. What else can we lose? We\u2019ve lost livelihoods and our industry. Boris Johnson or Gove, we\u2019re not bothered which. But someone who cares enough to rebuild us,\u201d she said. Boris Johnson was up early this morning for a Vote Leave visit to a fish processing factory in Lowestoft. I have not seen any words yet from the visit, but the photographs are a treat. If this was a contest about posing for silly pictures, Leave would obviously win by a mile. Ruth Davidson is now slouch in this field, but Johnson seems determined to do better. Alistair Darling, the Labour former chancellor, has accused the Tory MP Bernard Jenkin of trying to muzzle the Bank of England. Responding to the BBC\u2019s story about Jenkin\u2019s letter to the Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney (see 9.02am), Darling said in a statement issued by Britain Stronger in Europe: This is a blatant attempt to muzzle a respected independent voice. The Bank of England is independent, the governor is independent and he has a duty to say what he thinks. It is very clear the Leave campaign doesn\u2019t want people to hear what the Bank has to say on the most critical issue facing our generation because they don\u2019t like its conclusions. Here\u2019s a Britain Stronger in Europe spokesman responding to the Telegraph article by Nigel Lawson, Norman Lamont, Michael Howard and Iain Duncan Smith accusing the Treasury and the Bank of England of a \u201cwoeful failure\u201d to offer a fair analysis of what might happen in the event of Brexit. (The online article has just got Howard and Duncan Smith\u2019s bylines on it, but in the paper all four men are credited with authorship.) A Britain Stronger in Europe spokesman said: This is yet more fantasy economics from the Leave campaign. The reason they don\u2019t want to listen to economic experts is because they are all agreed that leaving the EU would wreck our economy and hammer family finances. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Claire. The BBC\u2019s Kamal Ahmed has a good story this morning, about a robust exchange of letters between Bernard Jenkin, the pro-Brexit Tory MP and chair of the Commons public administration and constitutional affairs committee, and Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England. Jenkin wrote to Carney effectively trying to silence him during the purdah period in the run-up to the referendum, when civil servants are expected to avoid getting involved. Jenkin said: You are prohibited from making any public comment, or doing anything which could be construed as taking part in the referendum debate. I have taken legal advice from Speakers\u2019 counsel . . . [and] wanted to take the opportunity to stress the importance of this matter. I very much hope you will avoid doing anything which could suggest you or the Bank have disregarded parliament\u2019s wishes. According to Ahmed, the Bank saw the letter as a \u201cthreat\u201d and Carney wrote a robust reply. He said that he had not expressed his personal views on the referendum but that the Bank had a duty to present its \u201cevidence-based judgments\u201d to the public. Carney said: All of the public comments that I, or other Bank officials, have made regarding issues related to the referendum have been limited to factors that affect the Bank\u2019s statutory responsibilities and have been entirely consistent with our remits. Carney also said the Bank was not covered by purdah rules, but that he had voluntarily agreed to be bound by them. Pro-Brexit MPs are angry with Carney because he has repeatedly highlighted the Bank\u2019s view that leaving the EU could harm the economy, not least in an interview with Andrew Marr last month (pdf). It looks as if David Cameron is off to Gibraltar today to make the case for the EU there. Ashley Fox, the Conservative MEP for south-west England and Gibraltar, says: Spanish newspaper El Pais says it will be the first visit by a British prime minister since 1968: Former Conservative party leader Lord (Michael) Howard has been on Sky News, continuing the theme of the letter he, Iain Duncan Smith and Lords Lamont and Lawson have in the Telegraph this morning criticising what they call \u201ca woeful failure on the part of the Bank of England, the Treasury, and other official sources to present a fair and balanced analysis\u201d in the referendum campaign. Howard told Sky News: I think it\u2019s a great pity, frankly, that the government have tried to drag the Bank of England into this debate. It would have been much better if the Bank of England \u2013 which after all is going to have to work with a situation whatever it is after the vote \u2013 had stood aloof from the debate and remained completely impartial. But he said he still backed David Cameron as prime minister, and gave George Osborne some tepid support: I haven\u2019t lost all my admiration for him. If that wasn\u2019t enough Question Time for you, by the way, the regular programme is on this evening \u2013 regular in that it\u2019s a panel, rather than a one-on-one with Dimbleby, but not regular in that there will likely be only one theme: the football. Ha, no: the referendum. Expect education secretary Nicky Morgan, Labour In lead Alan Johnson and boat-botherer Bob Geldof for remain; economist Ruth Lea, former Labour MP Tom Harris and prolific tweeter Louise Mensch for leave. Michael Gove, in his BBC Question Time interview last night, pointed the finger at the Guardian, which he said had \u201ctried to put words in [the] mouth\u201d of his father, Ernest Gove. Gove Snr had earlier told the Guardian\u2019s Scotland editor, Severin Carrell, that he had sold the family\u2019s fish processing firm in Aberdeen \u2013 contradicting claims from his politician son that European regulation had forced the company to close: I saw my father lose his job, I saw his business go to the wall, I saw 24 people who he employed also lose their jobs. Ernest Gove told the Guardian: It wasn\u2019t any hardship or things like that. I just decided to call it a day and sold up my business and went on to work with someone else. Michael Gove insisted yesterday: My dad was rung up by a reporter from the Guardian who tried to put words into his mouth but my dad has been clear, he was clear to the BBC on Sunday night, he was clear to me when I was a boy, that the business that he invested so much care and time in had to close as a result of the common fisheries policy. You can read the transcript of the interview with Ernest Gove here. The prime minister is unimpressed with the latest intervention by two of his predecessors as Tory party leader. Lord Howard and Iain Duncan Smith, along with former chancellors Lord Lamont and Lord Lawson, said in a letter to the Telegraph: There has been startling dishonesty in the economic debate, with a woeful failure on the part of the Bank of England, the Treasury, and other official sources to present a fair and balanced analysis. They have been peddling phoney forecasts and scare stories to back up the attempts of David Cameron and George Osborne to frighten the electorate into voting Remain. Cameron has hit back this morning: No real surprises here, but we have another handful of press declaring whether they\u2019re for In or Out. The Spectator is for Brexit: \u201cOut and into the world.\u201d The New Statesman says remain, as does the Voice, which says a vote to stay in the EU \u201cis a decision to protect the rights of black workers, challenge discrimination and stop families being torn apart\u201d. And the Financial Times is also for In. Its editor Lionel Barber told the Today programme: There will be a political crisis in this country if we vote no \u2013 I can\u2019t see David Cameron surviving. There will be a shock to the economy \u2026 but I think people are underestimating the severity of the shock. With just one week to go until voters cast their crosses to stay or go, our daily EU referendum live blog is here to get your morning started. I\u2019m putting together the morning briefing to set you up for the day ahead and steering the live blog until Andrew Sparrow takes his seat. Do come and chat in the comments below or find me on Twitter @Claire_Phipps. The big picture How to describe Wednesday, a day when Nigel Farage and Bob Geldof staged a naval battle on the Thames? My colleague Robert Booth was there and sums up the spectacle neatly: Before it was over, Farage\u2019s flotilla of angry trawlermen campaigning for leave had drenched Geldof\u2019s boat with hoses and angrily boarded it midstream to the dismay of the river authorities. Geldof\u2019s boat almost shredded the eardrums of those on Farage\u2019s vessel with a high decibel blast of 60s pop music; Geldof called Farage \u201ca fraud\u201d and flicked him the V sign. The flotilla farrago also had the side-effect of sinking George Osborne\u2019s sounding of the alarm over what he said would be a \u00a330bn black hole in the UK\u2019s public finances post-Brexit. That and the flurry of angry Tory MPs who said they would refuse to back a \u201cpunishment\u201d budget that the chancellor threatened could bump up income tax rates and slash spending on schools and hospitals. In a letter to the Telegraph this morning, former party leaders Lord Howard and Iain Duncan Smith, and former chancellors Lord Lawson and Lord Lamont lambast what they call the \u201cstartling dishonesty\u201d, \u201cphoney forecasts\u201d and \u201cludicrous scaremongering\u201d of remain campaigners on the economy. (It doesn\u2019t mention that \u00a3350m figure, mind.) A separate letter signed by 65 MPs, including six former cabinet ministers \u2013 Duncan Smith again, Liam Fox, Owen Paterson, David Jones, John Redwood and Cheryl Gillan \u2013 warns: If the chancellor is serious, then we cannot possibly allow this to go ahead. It would be unnecessary, wrong and a rejection of the platform on which we all stood. If he were to proceed with these proposals, the chancellor\u2019s position would become untenable. Lead Brexiteer Michael Gove said he wouldn\u2019t sign the letter \u2013 but only because he believed such a budget would never happen. In his BBC Question Time interview last night, he told David Dimbleby: There is no need for an emergency budget. The truth is, if we vote to leave we will be in an economically stronger position. (For more on Gove on BBCQT, see the Guardian columnists\u2019 verdicts here and Andrew Sparrow\u2019s at-a-glance summary here.) Some Tories remain with remain, however, and today the home secretary Theresa May \u2013 up till now a quiet figure in the campaign \u2013 along with cabinet colleagues Nicky Morgan, Liz Truss, Amber Rudd and Justine Greening will argue that female voters can \u201cbe the decisive voice in this referendum\u201d. It\u2019s not about so-called women\u2019s issues, though, which \u2013 according to the Telegraph \u2013 Morgan, for one, has \u201cnever believed in\u201d: We are just as concerned as men about our economy, defence capability and the influence we wield as a nation on the global stage. Much of the action today leaves London behind \u2013 I know! It does happen sometimes \u2013 and heads north, where Gordon Brown is speaking in Manchester; and then even further north, where rival rallies are taking place in Edinburgh and Glasgow. Brown, alongside shadow chancellor John McDonnell and former Labour leader Neil Kinnock, will say that the economies of the UK\u2019s 10 biggest cities outside the capital \u2013 Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Glasgow, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, Nottingham and Sheffield \u2013 are at risk if Britain opts to leave the UK: European money is necessary for renovation, renewal and regeneration \u2013 and right across the north, Scotland and Wales it is still vitally needed now. And Kinnock will resurrect one of his most notable riffs, albeit in rather less catchy form: I warn you not to be on low or middle incomes as the disruption brought by Brexit pushes up interest rates and prices, slashes benefits, and causes slump. I warn you not to expect work, as uncertainty causes investment to move to the single market which we would be leaving. You should also know: It\u2019s the Tooting byelection, in which south London voters will pick a Westminster successor to Sadiq Khan, the new London mayor. Labour\u2019s candidate is A&amp;E doctor Rosena Allin-Khan in what has been a safe seat for the party for more than 40 years. The Evening Standard has the full list of candidates. Labour MP Rushanara Ali says firms should give employees an extra hour off work next Thursday to enable them to vote in the referendum. A 96-year-old airman writes in support of remain: \u201cI remember how far we have come. I know what we stand to lose.\u201d Nine out of 10 university staff back Remain, and 40% would be more likely to leave the UK if Brexit wins, according to a Times Higher Education survey. European shares recovered on Wednesday after five days of losses. Poll position A fresh BMG Research poll, commissioned by the Electoral Reform Society, finds only 62% of voters say they will definitely cast a ballot next week. There\u2019s a chasm between wealthier voters (67% say they\u2019ll certainly vote) and poorer ones (just 55%). It also found that 22% of voters felt \u201cwell\u201d or \u201cvery well\u201d informed about the referendum. Would it cheer you up if I told you that\u2019s a rise of six percentage points since the same question was polled in February? The chief executive of the Electoral Reform Society, Katie Ghose, said: These findings are deeply concerning, and show there is a real risk of a low turnout and a demographic divide when voters go to the ballot box \u2026 A poor turnout alongside a close result poses the risk that people will view the decision as inconclusive, and we could see calls for further referendums or questioning of the validity of the result from either side. The last thing anyone wants to see is a contested and challenged outcome. New poll idea: how many more months of this would you tolerate? Diary At 10am Gordon Brown and Labour shadow chancellor John McDonnell speak at a Labour In event in Manchester. Former Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg appears with the Scottish party leader Willie Rennie alongside Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale at a rally in Edinburgh hosted by the European Movement in Scotland. And Scottish Brexit campaigners stage a rally in Glasgow with Vote Leave chairwoman Gisela Stuart. George Osborne is back again, with a Mansion House speech in the City of London. Read these How did the referendum campaign go so wrong for Labour, asks George Eaton in the New Statesman: Inside Labour, the blame is already being liberally distributed. Some identify Corbyn as the chief culprit. Recent polling showed that nearly half of the party\u2019s voters were uncertain of its position on the EU. This, MPs suggest, owes much to the Labour leader\u2019s limited enthusiasm for the cause \u2026 Yet there is no truth in the claim that the lifelong Eurosceptic is a secret Brexiter. \u201cI\u2019ve had private conversations with him. He is convinced that voting Remain is the right thing to do,\u201d a shadow cabinet minister told me \u2026 But Corbyn is not the only senior figure blamed for the drift towards Brexit. Alan Johnson, the head of the Labour In campaign, is accused of \u2018low energy\u2019 performances. Others cite the media\u2019s fixation with \u2018blue-on-blue\u2019 Conservative clashes. One senior MP suggested that the BBC could be \u2018in breach of its legal duties\u2019 by \u2018focusing on personalities, not issues\u2019. Jenni Russell in the Times says hard-won freedoms are at stake: We don\u2019t realise the fragility of our liberal societies and the need to protect them. The European project has been a conscious effort to spread its core values, from democracy to human rights. It has worked; central European and Baltic states could only join once they had adopted them. Walking away from Europe now is akin to storming out of the house you share with your exasperating, difficult relatives \u2026 The cavalier foolishness with which Leavers think they can rip Britain out of Europe and yet trust that everything else they value \u2014 trade, intelligence sharing, stability, goodwill \u2014 will stay the same amazes me. Privately the Europeans, led by Germany, are explicit that if we go Europe will close ranks against us. They must. They cannot afford to prioritise selling us BMWs above the survival of the union. They have to make clear to other nationalist parties tempted to follow the UK that there will be no preferential treatment, only harsh consequences. If we reject our neighbours, they will have to reject us. Proving that Brexit knows no boundaries (ironic, I know), here\u2019s the New Zealand Herald\u2019s Griff White with four models of how Britain could look outside the EU. Baffling claim of the day The Spectator has a poll on whether we can trust polls and it\u2019s hard to know what to think of that. Celebrity endorsement of the day A joyous Twitter thread, this, from Peep Show star Robert Webb (himself for remain), who spent a good few hours figuring out how each of the characters from the show would vote next week. If I posted the whole thread, the \u201cbrief\u201d part of this morning briefing would be severely compromised, but do look it up: The day in a tweet Intriguing. Vote Leave has been condemned for its \u201cWe send the EU \u00a3350m a week \u2013 let\u2019s fund our NHS instead\u201d slogan (Angela Eagle called it a \u201clie\u201d). But a u-turn seems \u2026 unlikely. Expect a fightback. If today were a song ... It would be Craig David\u2019s Seven Days. That\u2019s all we have left of this campaign. And David aficionados will know what they\u2019re supposed to be doing today. Ahem. And another thing Would you like to wake up to this briefing in your inbox every weekday? Sign up here!",

          "bodyText": "Nearly 400 international scientists called on Barack Obama to rule out further expansion of oil and gas exploration in Arctic waters under US control. The letter, signed by prominent Arctic, marine and climate specialists \u2013 including a former member of Obama\u2019s administration, urges the president to rule out any future hunting for oil in the waters of the Chukchi and Beaufort seas. \u201cNo new oil and gas leasing or exploration should be allowed in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas in the foreseeable future, including in the next five-year leasing plan,\u201d the scientists write in the letter. The letter follows a series of new heat and melting records in the Arctic, which have stunned scientists. Last week it was warmer in Nuuk, the capital of Greenland, than in New York City. The Danish Meteorological Society said the 75F temperature was the second heat record since April, and followed a very early start to the ice melt season. In addition to putting the entire Beaufort and Chukchi seas off-limits for the next oil and gas leasing offer, from 2017 to 2022, the letter urged the administration to consult native Alaskan groups on any further Arctic developments. The scientists said in the letter that expanding Arctic marine protection would help counter the effects of climate change. The letter commended Obama for putting 9.8m acres of Arctic waters off-limits to future drilling last year, and for entering into a joint initiative to protect the Arctic with Canada\u2019s Justin Trudeau. But the scientists called for further protections to areas important to native Alaskan fishing and hunting \u2013 including migration routes for whales and seabirds. \u201cI\u2019ve witnessed some of the unprecedented changes underway in the Arctic,\u201d Jane Lubchenco, who headed Noaa during Obama\u2019s first term, said in a statement. \u201cConserving important marine areas is an essential step in sustaining the region\u2019s resilience.\u201d The letter comes at a time when oil companies are already ruing earlier decisions to hunt for oil in Arctic waters \u2013 given the enormous costs and current low global oil prices. Shell declared last month it was giving up all but one of its leases in the Chukchi Sea, after spending seven years and $7bn hunting for oil in Arctic waters. The company said it would take another look at its leases in the Beaufort Sea.

          "body": "<p>Being a wedding guest is one of the toughest gigs to dress for. But if you think I am about to let you off the hook with some bleeding-heart wear-what-you-feel-comfortable-in guff, you can think again. It is a tough gig, but it\u2019s one that you need to nail. Because, assuming you\u2019re a common-or-garden guest \u2013 not the bride or groom, not making a speech or looking after the rings \u2013 turning up looking excellent is the one job you have been given. Once you have your outfit on point and have found the venue and are waiting over the road with your gin and tonic, you are along for the ride. All you need do for the rest of the day is eat and drink, clap and smile on cue.</p> <p>The least you can do is look good, frankly. But how to get the balance right between looking appropriate and being fourth-blue-lace-<a href=\"http://www.asos.com/women/a-to-z-of-brands/self-portrait/cat/?cid=19317&amp;cr=6\">Self-Portrait</a>-dress-from-left in the photos? Being a rule breaker is not the answer. I don\u2019t think we need to spell out why a day on which your friends are honouring their solemn commitment to a socially ratified contract of monogamy is the day on which you need to tell the world what a free spirit you are. If the bride wears jeans and a T-shirt, by all means do the same, but if the bride is in a white dress, you need to look equally smart or you will get on everyone\u2019s nerves. And consider the practicalities: weddings are long and often involve extended standing-around periods, so shoes that don\u2019t hurt and a coat that enhances the look, rather than killing it off, are non-negotiable.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/may/20/what-i-wore-this-week-flat-white-shoes-jess-cartner-morley\">What I wore this week: flat white shoes | Jess Cartner-Morley</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That\u2019s the T&amp;Cs covered; now for the fun bit. As a guest, the ceremonial function of your look is this: to bring the party. A summery, floor-length dress is to the weddings of summer 2016 what the cocktail jumpsuit was to last year\u2019s: the look that brings just enough fashion to liven things up. I say floor-length deliberately, because the look I am talking about is halfway between a maxi dress and a gown. Not a maxi dress, because to me a maxi dress is something casual in jersey you wear in the evening on holiday for ankle-protection from mosquitoes, and not a gown because, as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/justin-trudeau\">Justin Trudeau</a> would say, it\u2019s 2016.

          "bodyText": "Being a wedding guest is one of the toughest gigs to dress for. But if you think I am about to let you off the hook with some bleeding-heart wear-what-you-feel-comfortable-in guff, you can think again. It is a tough gig, but it\u2019s one that you need to nail. Because, assuming you\u2019re a common-or-garden guest \u2013 not the bride or groom, not making a speech or looking after the rings \u2013 turning up looking excellent is the one job you have been given. Once you have your outfit on point and have found the venue and are waiting over the road with your gin and tonic, you are along for the ride. All you need do for the rest of the day is eat and drink, clap and smile on cue. The least you can do is look good, frankly. But how to get the balance right between looking appropriate and being fourth-blue-lace-Self-Portrait-dress-from-left in the photos? Being a rule breaker is not the answer. I don\u2019t think we need to spell out why a day on which your friends are honouring their solemn commitment to a socially ratified contract of monogamy is the day on which you need to tell the world what a free spirit you are. If the bride wears jeans and a T-shirt, by all means do the same, but if the bride is in a white dress, you need to look equally smart or you will get on everyone\u2019s nerves. And consider the practicalities: weddings are long and often involve extended standing-around periods, so shoes that don\u2019t hurt and a coat that enhances the look, rather than killing it off, are non-negotiable. That\u2019s the T&amp;Cs covered; now for the fun bit. As a guest, the ceremonial function of your look is this: to bring the party. A summery, floor-length dress is to the weddings of summer 2016 what the cocktail jumpsuit was to last year\u2019s: the look that brings just enough fashion to liven things up. I say floor-length deliberately, because the look I am talking about is halfway between a maxi dress and a gown. Not a maxi dress, because to me a maxi dress is something casual in jersey you wear in the evening on holiday for ankle-protection from mosquitoes, and not a gown because, as Justin Trudeau would say, it\u2019s 2016. Get one. No excuses. \u2022 Jess wears dress, \u00a369, missselfridge.com. Styling: Melanie Wilkinson. Hair and makeup: Laurence Close At Carol Hayes Management.

          "bodyText": "China\u2019s foreign minister berated a journalist during a visit to Canada on Wednesday for asking an \u201cirresponsible\u201d question about China\u2019s human rights record. Wang Yi was in Ottawa to meet prime minister Justin Trudeau and St\u00e9phane Dion, the minister of foreign affairs. At a joint news conference offered by Wang and Dion, Canadian journalists were limited to one question and a follow-up for both ministers. Reporter Amanda Connolly of online news site IPolitics directed a question to Dion that touched on the case of Canadian Kevin Garratt, detained since 2014 in China on charges of espionage and stealing state secrets. Connolly said: \u201cThere are no shortages of concerns about China\u2019s treatment of human rights advocates such as the Hong Kong booksellers and its detention of the Garratts, not to mention the destabilising effects of its territorial ambitions in the South China Sea.\u201d She followed up with another question, which had been agreed upon by several news media. \u201cGiven these concerns, why is Canada pursuing closer ties with China, how do you plan to use that relationship to improve human rights and security in the region, and did you specifically raise the case of the Garratts during your talks?\u201d Dion said he had addressed the case with Wang and that the two had had an \u201chonest and frank\u201d conversation on human rights and consular affairs. \u201cWe expect that we will not always see eye-to-eye with each other, but we need to make progress,\u201d said Dion. Wang later weighed in with his own response, telling the reporter, \u201cI have to say that your question is full of prejudice against China and arrogance \u2026 I don\u2019t know where that comes from. This is totally unacceptable,\u201d he said through an interpreter. He continued, visibly angry. \u201cOther people don\u2019t know better than the Chinese people about the human rights condition in China and it is the Chinese people who are in the best situation, in the best position to have a say about China\u2019s human rights situation.\u201d Wang asked the journalist if she had ever been to China. \u201cDo you know that China has lifted more than 600 million people out of poverty? \u2026 And do you know China has written protection and promotion of human rights into our constitution?\u201d Canada\u2019s foreign minister stood by quietly as he continued. \u201cSo I would like to suggest to you please don\u2019t ask questions in such an irresponsible manner and though we welcome goodwill suggestions, we reject groundless or unwarranted accusations,\u201d he said. China is currently witnessing a period of political tightening that human rights activists and observers say is the most severe since the days following the 1989 crackdown on Tiananmen protesters. Since President Xi Jinping took power in late 2012, security forces have harassed, threatened and imprisoned scores of government critics including bloggers, journalists, lawyers, feminist campaigners and scholars. In January, a Swedish human rights activist was taken into secret detention and then paraded on television after being accused of being a foreign agent attempting to undermine the Communist party. More than 20 people remain in detention following an unprecedented crackdown on human rights lawyers that began in July 2015. Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch, said Wang\u2019s rebuke suggested Beijing believed it could control foreign journalists just as it does Chinese journalists at home. \u201cSenior Chinese officials are accustomed to not having to face tough questions from the press at home, given the state\u2019s chokehold on the media,\u201d she said. \u201cBut instead of being better equipped to answer ordinary questions like these when travelling abroad, officials like foreign minister Wang seem to think they can impose those same constraints on journalists abroad \u2013 and on that subject they are sorely mistaken.\u201d Richardson said Wang was also wrong to claim only Chinese people were equipped to discuss the country\u2019s human rights situation. \u201cIf that\u2019s true, why is his government imprisoning rather than engaging people like [jailed Nobel laureate] Liu Xiaobo and so many others from China who have similar questions?\u201d Wang\u2019s verbal attack on the journalist and Canada\u2019s failure to speak out against it sparked online criticism. \u201cAnd Mr Dion just stands there??\u201d tweeted Tony Clement, a Conservative party of Canada MP. The case of Garratt has strained relations between Ottawa and Beijing. Garratt and his wife Julia were detained in 2014 near the country\u2019s border with North Korea, where the pair ran a Christian coffee house.",

It is the first time conservationists from the three North American countries have come together to examine how well the respective countries are adhering to the 10% agreement. Campaigners say the 10% goal is a low benchmark and the countries should be aiming to exceed it, but the country-by-country analysis shows the US, Mexico and Canada will have to dramatically ramp up their conservation efforts to reach even that standard. Canada, which has the largest coastline in the world, is the furthest behind, with only 0.02% of its waters fully protected. When the analysis is expanded to include areas that allow things like commercial fishing, 0.11% is protected.

The report noted that the remote territories it excluded are less resistant to political conservation efforts, which the authors said was ironic because the more populated marine areas are the ones that need the most protection. Of the three countries analyzed in the report, Mexico boasted the most protected marine land, with 1.62% waters with limited to full protection.

The British prime minister, David Cameron, is likely to highlight the words, that come just hours after purdah rules in the UK prevent the civil service from issuing any further reports about the potential risks to jobs, pensions or mortgages. The G7 warning was included in a 32-page declaration, in the section that talks about non-economic threats, and also includes concerns over geopolitical conflicts, terrorism and the refugee crisis. It said: \u201cA UK exit from the EU would reverse the trend towards greater global trade and investment, and the jobs they create and is a further serious risk to growth.\u201d The wording appears to have been added at the 11th hour, because it was not included in the section on the global economy in a draft on Thursday night. Other leaders also revealed that Brexit was not discussed in a series of sessions that covered the economy, trade, counter-terrorism and sanctions on Russia. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, said: \u201cIt was no subject here. But there was the signal that all who sat here want Britain to stay part of the EU.\u201d The declaration also included a recognition that \u201congoing large-scale movements of migrants and refugees\u201d was a worldwide challenge that required a \u201cglobal response\u201d. On Thursday, Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, stressed that while geography meant Europe was rightly acting first, there was a need for countries around the world to step up efforts to financially support refugees and help develop relocation schemes. The leaders agreed there would be an increase in efforts to meet the short- and long-term needs of refugees, and also encouraged more financial support. The issue of steel production was also mentioned, with warnings that \u201cglobal excess capacity\u201d was having an impact across the world that must be \u201curgently addressed through the elimination of market-distorting measures\u201d. It comes as the fate of Port Talbot and other steelworks in Britain still hangs in the balance. The G7 declaration was meant to send a message to China on dumping, although it did not suggest concrete action. Cameron came to Japan wanting to focus on antimicrobial resistance, which is also included in the declaration. The G7 leaders endeavoured to take leadership on the issue that they said could \u201chave serious impacts on our economies\u201d. It comes after Cameron responded to a major British report on the issue with a promise to halve the number of inappropriate antibiotics prescribed in Britain by 2020.",

A film about Jesse Owens, it depicts the legendary African-American athlete training at Ohio State University, then his controversial participation in the 1936 Berlin Olympics. The Nazis hoped the Games would serve as perfect propaganda, not only for their regime, but for the concept of Aryan ethnic superiority. Instead, Owens became the hero of the event, winning four medals, making him both the fastest man on earth \u2013 and the most famous.</p> <p>From segregated changing rooms at home to Hitler\u2019s (historically disputed) refusal to shake his hand in Berlin, the film makes clear that Owens had to battle racism every rocket-fuelled step of the way. With the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/19/blacklivesmatter-birth-civil-rights-movement\">Black Lives Matter movement</a> \u2013 not to mention the rise of Donald Trump \u2013 forcing America to confront its treatment of African-Americans, Race seems especially timely, though it lacks the finesse of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/selma\">Selma</a>, another recent film that explored an even more pivotal moment in black American history.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/02/race-review-reverential-middle-of-the-pack-drama\">Race review \u2013 reverential middle-of-the-pack drama</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Stephan James, the 22-year-old Canadian actor, was in both movies: he stars as Owens in Race, and in Selma, he played civil rights activist <a href=\" http://www.biography.com/people/john-lewis-21305903\">John Lewis</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we started making Selma,\u201d he says, \u201cthe Black Lives Matter movement didn\u2019t exist. The parallels between Martin Luther King staging these marches, suffering police brutality \u2026 we weren\u2019t even aware when making the film that these sorts of things would start to happen again in 2015.\u201d Movies such as Selma and Race show, he says, \u201cthat we\u2019ve been dealing with these sorts of things for a long time. So when are we going to change it? When are we going to look to our past and find a way to better ourselves, and the way we do things?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e05f2fdaeefceedeaf46272123436364669bd9e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e05f2fdaeefceedeaf46272123436364669bd9e7/0_190_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stephan James\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stephan James.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bernard Weil/Toronto Star via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, James has no desire to be spokesman for a whole community. \u201cI don\u2019t want that pressure. Everything I do is just an opportunity to tell a great story. Who says no to playing Jesse Owens or John Lewis? It\u2019s just stories of incredible moments in time that don\u2019t just affect people who look like me, but people who look like you, who aren\u2019t American, who aren\u2019t black, who aren\u2019t athletes.

Softly spoken, with a goatee beard, rock-star shades and a black leather jacket, he adds a dash of glamour to his chosen interview venue \u2013 the business centre of the Mandarin hotel in New York.

And I think that that starts behind the scenes in the filmmaking process. We have to start creating more material that gives a platform for people of colour, for women, for old people and young people alike to be able to showcase their talent.

          "bodyText": "When it comes to titles, they don\u2019t get much blunter than Race. A film about Jesse Owens, it depicts the legendary African-American athlete training at Ohio State University, then his controversial participation in the 1936 Berlin Olympics. The Nazis hoped the Games would serve as perfect propaganda, not only for their regime, but for the concept of Aryan ethnic superiority. Instead, Owens became the hero of the event, winning four medals, making him both the fastest man on earth \u2013 and the most famous. From segregated changing rooms at home to Hitler\u2019s (historically disputed) refusal to shake his hand in Berlin, the film makes clear that Owens had to battle racism every rocket-fuelled step of the way. With the Black Lives Matter movement \u2013 not to mention the rise of Donald Trump \u2013 forcing America to confront its treatment of African-Americans, Race seems especially timely, though it lacks the finesse of Selma, another recent film that explored an even more pivotal moment in black American history. Stephan James, the 22-year-old Canadian actor, was in both movies: he stars as Owens in Race, and in Selma, he played civil rights activist John Lewis. \u201cWhen we started making Selma,\u201d he says, \u201cthe Black Lives Matter movement didn\u2019t exist. The parallels between Martin Luther King staging these marches, suffering police brutality \u2026 we weren\u2019t even aware when making the film that these sorts of things would start to happen again in 2015.\u201d Movies such as Selma and Race show, he says, \u201cthat we\u2019ve been dealing with these sorts of things for a long time. So when are we going to change it? When are we going to look to our past and find a way to better ourselves, and the way we do things?\u201d However, James has no desire to be spokesman for a whole community. \u201cI don\u2019t want that pressure. Everything I do is just an opportunity to tell a great story. Who says no to playing Jesse Owens or John Lewis? It\u2019s just stories of incredible moments in time that don\u2019t just affect people who look like me, but people who look like you, who aren\u2019t American, who aren\u2019t black, who aren\u2019t athletes. These stories are universal, so to me it\u2019s bigger than Black Lives Matter or the Civil Rights movement.\u201d It\u2019s a sunny Monday lunchtime in New York, and James has just flown in from Toronto, his home, where he has been hanging out with his family on a break from his next project, the Fox TV drama Shots Fired, in which he will play a prosecutor from the Department of Justice in a case involving a black cop who has shot dead an unarmed white teenager.

that supports a bit of both stimulus and austerity, but offers a firm rebuke on currency manipulation.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Brexit</h2> <p>Also up for discussion, although not on the official agenda, is Britain\u2019s upcoming referendum \u2013 looming on 23 June \u2013 on whether to stay within or leave the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/eu\">European Union</a>.</p> <p>As

Or just amused. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon is on his way to the summit. The leaders of both the EU and the US have made some barbed comments about Chinese protectionism at the summit. European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said the EU was ready to \u201cstep up\u201d its measures to defend the steel industry against dumping. He made clear the issue would be considered when deciding whether to grant the coveted \u201cmarket economy status\u201d to China. He added: \u201cGlobal overcapacity in the steel sector is of great concern to Europeans. It has cost Europe thousands of jobs since 2008 and the over-capacity in China alone has been estimated at almost double European annual production. \u201cSo we will make it clear that we will step up our trade defence measures. This effort has started and as far as the market economy status for China is concerned, we will discuss this in detail. The European Union has launched an in-depth impact assessment and when this impact assessment is finished, we can deliver in the best way possible. \u201cEveryone has to know that if somebody distorts the market, Europe cannot be defenceless.\u201d Obama also appeared to be addressing the Chinese when he said the leaders at the summit \u201cemphasised the importance of pushing back against either protectionism or competitive currency devaluations or the kinds of beggar-thy-neighbour strategies that all to often lead to everyone being worse off.\u201d David Cameron uses a possible trade deal that could be worth \u00a35bn to UK economy to make argument for Britain remaining in Europe, writes Anushka Asthana. Some of the world leaders at the G7 got an underwhelming spin in fuel-cell cars, according to AFP. Matteo Renzi of Italy and Canadian leader Justin Trudeau were bundled into eco-friendly sedans for an achingly slow ride around a carpark that ended with the photogenic pair dropped off for the talks, which are being held southwest of Tokyo. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and European Council President Donald Tusk also got a very uneventful crash course on the cars, which are powered by hydrogen and emit only water from their exhaust pipe. Juncker emerged from his low-adrenaline ride looking a little underwhelmed and offered what appeared to be a shrug. David Cameron stayed away, as Justin McCurry noted earlier. Here\u2019s a summary of the key developments on the first day of the G7 summit. Barack Obama said that world leaders are rightly \u201crattled\u201d by the prospect of Donald Trump running for US president. \u201cA lot of the proposals that he has made display either ignorance of world affairs or a cavalier attitude,\u201d Obama told reporters at the summit. Speaking a day ahead of his historic visit to Hiroshima, Obama said the trip will underline the dangers of nuclear warfare. \u201cThe backdrop of a nuclear event remains something that presses on the back of our imagination,\u201d he said. \u201cNorth Korea is big worry for all us,\u201d Obama said. He added: \u201cKim Jong-Un in particular seems to be convinced that his own legitimacy is tied up with developing nuclear weapons.\u201d The leaders of European countries and Japan have agreed to timeline on a trade deal that is said to be worth \u00a35bn for the UK economy. Cameron said: \u201cThis agreement underlines once again why we are stronger, safer and better off in a reformed EU.\u201d Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe warned of an economic crisis on the scale of 2008. Abe presented data at an opening session showing that commodities prices have fallen 55% since 2014, the same margin they fell during the global financial crisis, the newspaper said, interpreting this as \u201cwarning of the re-emergence of a Lehman-scale crisis\u201d. European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, and his senior Martin Selmayr, have criticised leading Brexit campaigner Boris Johnson. Juncker said Johnson\u2019s claims about European integration were not \u201cin line with reality\u201d. Selmayr, then stoked the row by tweeting about the \u201chorror scenario\u201d of a 2017 G7 meeting with Donald Trump, Marine Le Pen and Johnson around the leaders\u2019 table. Johnson dismissed the remarks. \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying to the British people is in line with reality. If we vote to remain ... then they will go on with measures to take us further into a federal European super state,\u201d he told Sky News. Earlier, the leaders attended the Ise Jingu shrine \u2013 a choice of location that drawn criticism that Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe is attempting to use the shrine to promote his conservative political agenda. The European Union and Japan have reached political agreement on speeding up the completion of long-running negotiations for a trade deal which Downing Street believes could be worth \u00a35bn a year to the UK economy, PA reports. In talks at the G7 summit in Japan, leaders including David Cameron agreed to instruct negotiators to work to an accelerated timetable which could see the deal concluded as early as this autumn and come into effect next year. The prime minister made it a key objective of the two-day gathering to secure progress in negotiations on the EU/Japan Economic Partnership Agreement/Free Trade Agreement - which began in 2013 and were initially intended to be completed last year. Downing Street said an agreement could be worth the equivalent of \u00a3200 a year to British households in increased exports of products such as cars, manufactured goods, chemicals, food and drinks, as well as services, to Japan. But key elements of the deal - including tariffs on agricultural and automotive exports and government procurement - must be completed over the summer if it is to be signed by the end of the year. A successful deal would mean the elimination of the vast majority of trade tariffs and boost imports and exports in key areas such as agriculture, car manufacturing and clothing, said Downing Street. Welcoming the progress made towards finalising the deal, Cameron said: \u201cThis agreement underlines once again why we are stronger, safer and better off in a reformed EU. As prime minister [Shinzo] Abe said when visiting the UK, Japan\u2019s priority is negotiating with large trade blocs - not individual states in Europe. And this is something we hear time and again from foreign leaders. \u201cNot only will UK households lose out to the tune of 4,300 a year if we vote to leave, but we will be turning our backs on global trade deals which underpin our security and prosperity.\u201d In a statement Abe said: \u201cThe agreement is going to be beneficial for bringing in sustainable and robust growth for the whole world economy.\u201d Obama said he expects the Taliban to continue a strategy of violence following the appointment of a hardline leader, adding that the United States aims to uphold Afghanistan\u2019s fragile democratisation and prevent its use as a base by Islamic State, Reuters reports. \u201cThis continues to be an organisation that sees violence as a strategy for obtaining its goals and moving its agenda forward in Afghanistan,\u201d said Obama, told reporters during the G7 summit. \u201cIn the short-term, we anticipate that the Taliban will continue to pursue an agenda of violence and blowing up innocent people.\u201d \u201cOur goal right now is to make sure (Afghanistan\u2019s) constitution and democratic process is upheld (and) maintain the counter-terrorism platforms that we need in the region so that al Qaeda and now Isil are not able to take root and use it as a base to attack us in the United States,\u201d he said, using an acronym for Islamic State. The selection of cleric Mullah Haibatullah Akhundzada as the new Taliban chief on Wednesday all but dashes Obama\u2019s hopes for opening peace talks before he leaves office, one of his top foreign policy goals, current and former US defence and intelligence officials said. Akhundzada, a conservative Islamic scholar from the Taliban\u2019s stronghold in southern Afghanistan, succeeded Mullah Akhtar Mansour four days after he was killed in a U.S. drone strike. Some US officials had expressed hope that Mansour\u2019s death would eliminate an obstacle to peace negotiations between the Taliban and the government of Afghan President Ashraf Ghani. And here\u2019s AP take on Obama\u2019s claim that world leaders are rattled by Trump. Associated Press have done a take on Obama\u2019s comments on Trump: It\u2019s not just world leaders who are \u201crattled\u201d by Donald Trump. A new poll of the public in six countries allied to the US found that 78% thought that Trump would make the world more dangerous. The YouGov poll for the campaign group Avaaz found that 61% said his views made a Paris style attack more likely. The survey views from the UK, France, Germany, Mexico, Canada and Japan is believed to be the first global poll on attitudes to Trump. When asked about Trump\u2019s views, 62% of Britons with good knowledge of Trump\u2019s views said they made them \u2018concerned\u2019, 75% said they \u2018dislike or hate\u2019 his politics, and they make 38% feel \u2018sick to their stomach\u2019. Results also show that Trump\u2019s inflammatory rhetoric, which has targeted Muslims, Mexicans, and women, is damaging America\u2019s reputation among citizens of its allies, with 74% of polled respondents saying they thought less of America thanks to Trump\u2019s hardline views. Ricken Patel, the head of Avaaz, said: \u201cMost of the world agrees with most Americans - The Donald is dangerously dumb. A dream for Isis [Islamic State] and a nightmare for the rest of us. People everywhere are united against his politics of division, because they know the only way we meet challenges like terrorism and climate change is together.\u201d David Cameron\u2019s enthusiasm for cars clearly doesn\u2019t carry over to the new, eco-friendly variety, after he reportedly turned down the opportunity to try out a one of Japan\u2019s latest hydrogen-powered vehicles, writes Justin McCurry. With the slowdown in the global economy dominating talks, it was perhaps appropriate that Jean-Claude Juncker, Donald Tusk, Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi and Canadian leader Justin Trudeau were driven around at snail\u2019s pace during a demonstration of Japan\u2019s latest fuel-cell technology. The four were treated to a post-prandial spin in eco-friendly sedans, which are powered by hydrogen and emit only water from their exhaust pipe. Juncker reacted to his experience with a shrug, while David Cameron, Barack Obama, Angela Merkel and Francois Hollande had reportedly indicated to their Japanese hosts that they did not wish to appear in Top Gear: the G7 episode. Obama brushed off calls for Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton to move hurriedly to resolve the primary so that Democrats can unite behind one candidate, AP reports. The president argued that that unlike the Republicans, this year\u2019s Democratic candidates aren\u2019t that ideologically divided. He likened the hard-fought campaign between Clinton and Sanders to the one he waged with Clinton in 2008. \u201cDuring primaries, people get a little grumpy with each other. Somebody\u2019s supporter pops off and there\u2019s a certain buildup of aggravation,\u201d Obama said. \u201cEvery little speed bump, conflict trash-talking that takes place is elevated.\u201d He urged both Democratic candidates to \u201ctry to stick to the issues,\u201d adding that the grumpiness often stems from voters\u2019 frustration when the campaign instead becomes dominated by talk about \u201cpersonalities and character.\u201d Here\u2019s more about what Obama said about Donald Trump. Ask about the reaction of world leaders to Trump, Obama said: \u201cThe world pays attention to the US elections ... I think it is fair to say that they are surprised by the Republican nominee. \u201cThey are not sure how seriously to take some of his pronouncements, but they are rattled by him and for good reason, because a lot of the proposals that he has made display either ignorance of world affairs or a cavalier attitude or an interest in getting tweets and headlines instead of actually think through what it it that is required to keep America safe and secure and prosperous, and what\u2019s required to keep the world on an even keel.\u201d On North Korea, Obama said its nuclear ambitions pose a serious medium-term threat, adding that engagement with China and other countries had seen progress on the issue. He said: \u201cNorth Korea is a big worry for all of us. They are not at point right now when they can effectively hit US targets. But each time that they test, even if those tests fail, they learn something. It is clear that ideologically they are convinced and Kim Jong-Un in particular seems to be convinced, that his own legitimacy is tied up with developing nuclear weapons.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s something that we\u2019ve put at the centre of discussions and negotiations with China. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is improved responses from China and countries in the region...that may reduce the risks of North Korea selling weapons or missile material to other countries.\u201d The bitter legacy of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and the US military presence on Okinawa are threatening to cast a shadow over Barack Obama\u2019s last G7 summit as US president, writes Justin McCurry in his latest dispatch from Ise-Shima. Here\u2019s a recording of most of Obama\u2019s 30 minute remarks to reporters at the summit. Here\u2019s a transcript of Obama\u2019s remarks about the global economy. One of the benefits of the G7 is that you have like-minded countries who are committed to democracy, and free markets and international law, and international norms. So far we have discussed issues of the global economy and the need to continue to accelerate growth. To use all the tools at our disposal to ensure that we are not only putting people back to work but also helping to lift wages and helping to make sure we can maintain the momentum of the recovery that\u2019s taking place in the United States most prominently but also we are starting to see some progress in Europe. The fact that the Greek debt crisis has been resolved for a reasonable length of time, should help, but we have all got a lot of work to do. We had a chance to talk about trade, not only TTP but also TTIP and we recommitted ourselves to try to finish those negotiations before the end of year. And emphasised the importance of pushing back against either protectionism or competitive currency devaluations or the kinds of beggar-thy-neighbour strategies that all to often lead to everyone being worse off. Japan\u2019s prime minister Shinzo Abe said G7 agreed to the need for spending plans to boost world growth, but said they would be flexible, writes Anushka Asthana. Flexibility on the economy was one of David Cameron\u2019s key desires coming into the summit. \u201cG7 leaders voiced the view that emerging economies are in a severe situation, although there were views that the current economic situation is not a crisis,\u201d Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary, Hiroshige Seko, said after the first day of a two-day G7 summit in Ise-Shima, central Japan. On Afghanistan, Obama said: \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting a liberal democrat to be the new leader of the Taliban. This is an organisation that still sees violence as a way of achieving its goals. There comes a point that the Taliban realises that they not going to be able overrun the country.\u201d He urged the Taliban to enter reconciliation talks led by the Afghan government. There will come a point eventually where there are those who surround the Taliban community will realise their goals are best served by talks, Obama said. Obama dodges questions about Clinton\u2019s emails and the release of transcripts over her speeches to Goldman Sachs. On the Democratic race, Obama claimed \u201cnot much\u201d divided Bernie Sanders and Hilary Clinton ideologically, citing education and health care. He said the only real difference surrounded \u201ctactics\u201d. He added: \u201cThey are both good people. Both sides have run serious campaigns.\u201d Obama said every blip in the campaign was \u201celevated\u201d. On Democrats prospects he added: \u201cDay to day choppiness is not indicative of longer term trends ... the eventual nominee sure wishes it was over. It\u2019s lot more draining arguing against your friends ... these are folks who are serious about solving the country\u2019s problems. They are veterans of the political grind.\u201d Obama said the world is \u201csurprised\u201d by the prospect of Donald Trump as the Republican nominee for president. He added that Trump had \u201crattled\u201d world leaders. Many of the likely Republican nominee\u2019s proposals display ignorance about world affairs, a cavalier attitude or an interest in getting \u201ctweets and headlines,\u201d Obama added. He contrasted that to proposals to make America safe. Pressed about the threat from North Korea, Obama said he has been working on \u201cdefence architecture\u201d with the Pentagon to guard against unexpected events. \u201cNorth Korea is big worry for all us,\u201d Obama said. They can\u2019t yet reach US targets, he added, but said: \u201cEach time they test they learn something.\u201d Asked about his visit to Hiroshima on Friday, Obama said: \u201cThe dropping of the atomic bomb was an inflexion point in modern history. It is something that all of us have had to deal with. The backdrop of a nuclear event presses against our imaginations.\u201d He says we should all have a \u201csense of urgency\u201d about the threat of nuclear war. \u201cThe job is not done, in reducing conflict and building institutes for peace,\u201d he said. But he described the nuclear deal with Iran as a \u201cbig piece of business\u201d. Barack Obama is giving a press conference at the summit. He says there has been \u201csome progress\u201d towards economic recovery in Europe. He said the Greek debt crisis has eased but there is still a lot of economic work to do. Obama said the leaders agreed to try to get a deal on TTIP and TTP before the end of the year. He also warned against \u201cprotectionism\u201d. Johnson was played a clip of Juncker\u2019s remarks on Sky News. He replied: \u201cI\u2019m afraid what I\u2019m saying to the British people is in line with reality. If we vote to remain ... then they will go on with measures to take us further into a federal European super state ... The whole exercise in Brussels is now aimed at propping up the Euro. \u201cThey will try to create a fiscal union, a political union. Germany who is effectively the paymaster of this whole enterprise will want to insist that there is an economic governance of Europe that in my view become \u2013 it is already profoundly undemocratic, but it will tend towards the creation of united states of Europe into which Britain will inevitably be sucked by the usage of single market mechanism. \u201cAnd I\u2019m afraid we have not be able to get out of the obligation of paying for this whole exercise.\u201d Boris Johnson is being interviewed on Sky News. He hasn\u2019t been asked about Juncker\u2019s remarks yet. The European Commission has published a transcript of Jean-Claude Juncker\u2019s remarks at the summit including his barbed comments about Brexit campaigner Boris Johnson. Q4 Mister President, what would you advise to Boris Johnson - should we stay in the EU? President Juncker: The general atmosphere of our talks would be better if Britain is staying in the European Union. I am reading in British papers that Boris Johnson spent part of his life in Brussels. It is time for him to come back to Brussels, in order to check in Brussels if everything he is telling the British people is in line with reality - I do not think so. So, he would be welcome in Brussels at any time. PA\u2019s political editor Andrew Woodcock say that David Cameron and the other G7 leaders are believed to be the first sitting heads of their countries to visit the Ise-Jingu Grand Shrine. Welcoming Cameron to Japan, Shinzo Abe described Ise - which has remained a popular pilgrimage site - as \u201ca place dear to Japanese hearts\u201d. Cameron and the other leaders - US president Barack Obama, Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel, Francois Hollande of France, Canadian PM Justin Trudeau and Italy\u2019s Matteo Renzi - were granted access to the inner part of the shrine, which is normally out of bounds to everyone but the site\u2019s priests and distinguished visitors. After a brief cleansing ceremony with holy water, Cameron planted a Japanese cedar tree with President Hollande and Mr Trudeau, using shovels handed to them by schoolchildren from the Mie Prefecture. The G7 leaders then signed individual visitor books, with Cameron writing: \u201cIt is a great pleasure to visit this place of peace, tranquillity and natural beauty as we gather in Ise-Shima for Japan\u2019s G7, and to pay my respects as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom at the Ise-Jingu.\u201d The second working session - a discussion on trade - is underway. It will include talks on the controversial trade agreement TTIP or Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. For more on the EU referendum debate and the future of Tata steel, Andy Sparrow has just launched today\u2019s Politics Live. The host of the summit Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe has warned of an economic crisis on the scale of 2008, according to Reuters citing a Nikkei report. Abe presented data at an opening session showing that commodities prices have fallen 55% since 2014, the same margin they fell during the global financial crisis, the newspaper said, interpreting this as \u201cwarning of the re-emergence of a Lehman-scale crisis\u201d. Abe has pledged to raise Japan\u2019s sales tax to 10% from 8% in April next year as planned, unless there is a financial crisis on the scale of the Lehman collapse or a major natural disaster. \u201cG7 leaders voiced the view that emerging economies are in a severe situation, although there were views that the current economic situation is not a crisis,\u201d Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshige Seko told reporters at the summit. Abe told the group that they shared the view on the risks to the global economy, Seko said. The first day of the G7 summit in Japan has so far been overshadowed by a row over Brexit, with statements from the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, and his senior aide bringing the issue of the UK\u2019s EU membership to the forefront of the discussions: Juncker dragged prominent Brexit campaigner and former London mayor Boris Johnson into the talks in Ise-Shima, saying Johnson\u2019s claims about the EU were not \u201cin line with reality\u201d. His aide and head of cabinet, Martin Selmayr, then stoked the row by tweeting about the \u201chorror scenario\u201d of a 2017 G7 meeting with Donald Trump, Marine Le Pen and Johnson around the leaders\u2019 table. Meanwhile, the summit continued with the group of seven leaders set to discuss the global economy, steel, terrorism and the refugee crisis, in a wide-ranging agenda. Earlier, the leaders attended the Ise Jingu shrine \u2013 a choice of location that drawn criticism that Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe is attempting to use the shrine to promote his conservative political agenda. I\u2019m now handing over this live blog to my colleague Matthew Weaver in London for continuing coverage of Thursday\u2019s summit. I will be back on Friday to cover day two, including US president Barack Obama\u2019s historic visit to Hiroshima. Thanks for reading. The first session is over. There will be a side event on terror attacks against cultural artefacts. David Cameron has been strolling and chatting with Barack Obama, and is about to head to a restaurant for a drink. A Downing Street adviser said it was a \u201cvery friendly chat\u201d with the president. There will be another side event focusing on trade. A popular request from below the line: Initially David Cameron appeared to be missing from the line-up \u2013 but here he is, better late than never: One of the most senior officials in the EU has warned that having Boris Johnson as British prime minister would be a \u201chorror scenario\u201d. Tweeting from the G7 summit, Martin Selmayr, who is chief of staff to the European Commission president, lumped Johnson in with France\u2019s Marine Le Pen and the US Republican presidential candidate, Donald Trump. \u201c#G7 2017 with Trump, Le Pen, Boris Johnson, Beppe Grillo? A horror scenario that shows well why it is worth fighting populism. #withJuncker,\u201d he wrote, in a provocative message that could trigger a backlash in Britain. A not particularly diplomatic tweet from Martin Selmayr, Juncker\u2019s head of cabinet and righthand man, who describes a potential 2017 G7 meeting convening Donald Trump, Marine Le Pen, Boris Johnson and Beppe Grillo, leader of Italy\u2019s Five Star Movement, as \u201ca horror scenario\u201d: Along with this warning from the account of Donald Tusk: The economy The precarious state of the global economy \u2013 and the slowing of growth in China \u2013 will be top of the agenda over the next two days. The G7 leaders are not united on the best way to tackle the issue. As Agence France-Press reports: One side, led by Japan, favours spending: government stimulus. The other, led by Germany, thinks the fiscal largesse of recent years needs to be brought under control \u2026 Expect a final statement that supports a bit of both stimulus and austerity, but offers a firm rebuke on currency manipulation. Brexit Also up for discussion, although not on the official agenda, is Britain\u2019s upcoming referendum \u2013 looming on 23 June \u2013 on whether to stay within or leave the European Union. As Justin McCurry reports: For David Cameron, who went straight into talks with Abe and Obama after touching down in Japan on Wednesday night, the summit will be an opportunity to win backing for his campaign to keep Britain in the EU, less than a month before the Brexit referendum. Abe and Obama have already voiced concern over a possible Brexit, but a unanimous show of support for Cameron, while unlikely to appear in the communiqu\u00e9, would make the long journey from London to Japan seem worthwhile. The issue has already caused a stir on the sidelines of the summit, with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker accusing pro-Brexit campaigner Boris Johnson of making claims about the EU that are not \u201cin line with reality\u201d. Terrorism A pressing issue after attacks in Brussels and Paris, leaders are likely to want to present a strong, united front against the threat. Justin Trudeau might also raise the plight of a Canadian hostage held by militant group Abu Sayyaf in the Philippines \u2013 in particular Canada\u2019s resolve, backed by the UK, that ransoms should not be paid to extremists. Refugees A key concern for European leaders, with European Council president Donald Tusk saying he had come to Japan to seek international support to ease the crisis: If we [at G7] do not take the lead in managing this crisis, nobody would. China China is not represented at the G7 summit, but the reach of Beijing will certainly feature, whether in discussion about the global economy or concerns over territorial disputes in the South China Sea. Already this week, Barack Obama has said Washington supports Vietnam\u2019s territorial claims against Beijing in the South China Sea and \u2013 without mentioning China by name \u2013 warned: Big nations should not bully smaller ones. David Cameron also warned China that it must abide by the outcome of international arbitration on its increasingly assertive territorial claims in the South China Sea \u2013 the cause of bitter disputes with the Philippines and other countries in the region. G7 host Japan is also embroiled in ongoing rows over disputed territory in the East China Sea. And this was before news broke today that China is poised to send nuclear-armed submarines into the Pacific. A Downing Street source has responded to Jean-Claude Juncker\u2019s comments on Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit claims: Our view on Boris is that we think that he is wrong, we don\u2019t agree with him. So far neither the out campaign nor Boris Johnson have been able to articulate what getting out of the EU looks like. And here\u2019s what they ate during that working lunch: lobster, beef and manju (a kind of cake made with bean paste). Another shot of the assembled leaders, this time at their opening working lunch session, complete with handy table signs telling each other what nation they\u2019ve come from: Ahead of the traditionally awkward traditional group photo, expected later on Thursday afternoon, we have this equally awkward tree-planting image. It\u2019s safe to say nobody here looks entirely comfortable with a shovel. They\u2019re planting Japanese cedar trees close to the inner Naiku shrine at Ise Jingu. It is not clear why David Cameron and Justin Trudeau have had to share a sapling. As the talks begin in earnest, Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi tweets about the Italians saving lives at sea \u2013 on Wednesday, the Italian navy saved 550 refugees after a vessel capsized in the Mediterranean. The refugee crisis is on the agenda at G7, with Donald Tusk earlier saying he had come to Japan to seek international support: If we [at G7] do not take the lead in managing this crisis, nobody would. As the G7 leaders come to the conclusion of their working lunch \u2013 and ahead of the traditional group photo \u2013 Donald Tusk, the European Council president, has been speaking on the sidelines of the summit about China and Russia. (Russia has not been invited to the meetings of what was once the G8 for two years, since its annexation of Crimea.) Tusk said the Crimea issue, as well as China\u2019s activities in the South and East China Seas, were problems on which the G7 ought to take a \u201cclear and tough stance\u201d. The test of our credibility at the G7 is our ability to defend the common values that we share. This test will only pass if we take a clear and tough stance on every topic of our discussions here \u2026 I refer in particular to the issue of maritime security and the South and East China Seas, and Russia-Ukraine issue. If we are to defend our common values it is not enough these days to only believe in them. We also have to be ready to protect them. The policy of the G7 is clear: any maritime or territorial claim should be based on international law and any territorial dispute should be resolved by peaceful means. Unilateral action and the use of force or coercion will not be accepted. The European Union and the entire G7 continue to believe that this crisis can only be resolved in full compliance with \u2026 international law, especially the legal obligation to respect Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence. I want to state clearly that our stance vis-a-vis Russia, including economic sanctions, will remain unchanged as long as the Minsk agreements are not fully implemented. Unfortunately there is much less progress on the implementation of Minsk than we had hoped for one year ago. (All quotes via AFP.) For those interested in background reading: China\u2019s ambitions in the South China Sea Tensions between China and Japan over East China Sea Ukraine crisis: what is the Minsk ceasefire agreement? With the G7 leaders expected to continue their support of David Cameron\u2019s argument that Britain should stay in the EU, the Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has hit back at criticism of his own position, arguing he is on a \u201cunity ticket\u201d with Barack Obama, Justin Trudeau and John Key. A British Conservative MP, Andrew Rosindell, who sits on the foreign affairs select committee, has argued Turnbull\u2019s position against Brexit is \u201cridiculous\u201d, saying: Australia would never countenance signing away permanent legal power over its rules, its laws, its traditions to other countries in the Asia-Pacific region. Come on Malcolm, when are you going to do your political union with Indonesia or Japan? When are you going to have free movement with Asia? It\u2019s absolutely in Australia\u2019s interests that Britain leaves the EU, so that we can have free trade agreements, we can have more free movement, so we can work together. On the campaign trail in Rockhampton on Thursday, Turnbull hit back, pointing out that he holds the same position as the US president and prime ministers of Canada and New Zealand: We all believe that our countries benefit from Britain being part of the EU. So it is to our advantage if Britain is part of the EU. They are part of a big market and they\u2019re a good friend to have there. But it is a matter for British people and I am on a unity ticket with those other leaders that I\u2019ve mentioned and many others. But it is a matter for the British people. The global steel industry crisis is high on the agenda in Ise-Shima, with G7 leaders set to discuss how to deal with China\u2019s dumping of surplus steel. British prime minister David Cameron has said the summit was an opportunity to tackle the crisis in Europe\u2019s steel industry, saying EU tariffs had proved \u201ceffective\u201d against market distortions caused by China\u2019s selling of surplus steel at low prices: Wherever we have taken action, there has been very steep \u2013 90%-plus \u2013 reductions in Chinese steel imports. This is a good opportunity to talk again with the European Commission and the president of the Council and France, Germany and Italy about the actions we are taking in Europe to put tariffs up against dumping of Chinese steel, which is effective. European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said the EU was ready to step up its defence of the industry: Global overcapacity in the steel sector is of great concern to Europeans. It has cost Europe thousands of jobs since 2008 and the over-capacity in China alone has been estimated at almost double European annual production. So we will make it clear that we will step up our trade defence measures. This effort has started and as far as the market economy status for China is concerned, we will discuss this in detail. The European Union has launched an in-depth impact assessment and when this impact assessment is finished, we can deliver in the best way possible. Everyone has to know that if somebody distorts the market, Europe cannot be defenceless. With China not at the table in Ise, but certainly on the agenda, news that the Chinese military is poised to send submarines armed with nuclear missiles into the Pacific Ocean for the first time will no doubt resonate at the G7 summit. As the Guardian\u2019s world affairs editor, Julian Borger, reports: Until now, Beijing has pursued a cautious deterrence policy, declaring it would never be the first to use nuclear weapons in a conflict and storing its warheads and its missiles separately, both strictly under the control of the top leadership. Deploying nuclear-armed submarines would have far-reaching implications. Warheads and missiles would be put together and handed over to the navy, allowing a nuclear weapon to be launched much faster if such a decision was taken. The start of Chinese missile patrols could further destabilise the already tense strategic standoff with the US in the South China Sea. Read the full report here: So far, anti-G7 protests have been virtually non-existent, bar a small demonstration in Shima on Wednesday morning. This is partly because of the large police presence, but also the location of the summit, which is being held in a relatively remote part of Japan \u2013 the venue for the meetings is a hotel in the middle of an island. But there has been a demonstration today outside the US embassy in Seoul, South Korea, ahead of Obama\u2019s planned visit to Hiroshima on Friday. As AFP reports: A group representing Korean victims of the US atomic bombings of Japan protested on Thursday that their suffering was being neglected ahead of Obama\u2019s historic visit to Hiroshima. The Association of Korean Atomic Bomb Victims estimates that anywhere between 40,000 and 70,000 Koreans died in Hiroshima and Nagasaki when atomic bombs laid waste to the two cities in August 1945. The Korean peninsula was under Japanese colonial rule at the time, and most of those who died had been conscripted by the Japanese military or forced into hard labour. Consequently, the association argues that Koreans were multiple victims, deserving not only of an apology from the United States, but also from Japan. Around two dozen members of the group \u2013 including survivors and relatives of those who died \u2013 gathered outside the US embassy in Seoul with placards reading: \u201cApologise to Korean victims of the Atomic Bomb\u201d and \u201cAcknowledge the 2nd generation victims\u201d. \u201cThe world thinks Japan is the atomic bomb victim. That is wrong. Japan is the country that began the war. Koreans are the victims of the atomic bomb,\u201d said Shim Jin-Tae, who was two years old and in Hiroshima when the first bomb fell. Some details coming through of the leaders\u2019 time in the Ise Jingu shrine, where each of the visiting politicians were greeted by the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe. The leaders were taken to the inner Naiku shrine \u2013 reserved for distinguished visitors only \u2013 where they underwent a cleansing ceremony. British prime minister David Cameron, French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau then planted a Japanese cedar tree, helped by schoolchildren from the Mie prefecture. The ceremonies then switched to the signing of the visitor books, in which Cameron wrote: It is a great pleasure to visit this place of peace, tranquillity and natural beauty as we gather in Ise Shima for Japan\u2019s G7, and to pay my respects as prime minister of the United Kingdom at the Ise Jingu. While the G7 leaders begin their talks on Thursday afternoon, their spouses are due to visit Mikimoto pearl island in the nearby town of Toba, where they will watch a demonstration by Japan\u2019s female free divers. Ama \u2013 women who dive without breathing apparatus to scour the seabed for shellfish \u2013 say their traditional way of life is threatened by falling seafood stocks and a lack of interest among younger women in learning the skill. Akie Abe, the wife of the Japanese prime minister, will lead the trip. She recently described the ama as the embodiment of Japanese values. Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, has called on Boris Johnson \u2013 the former London mayor and high profile Brexit campaigner \u2013 to come to Brussels and see whether his view of the EU fits with \u201creality\u201d. Juncker also warned that if Johnson became prime minister in the UK, his discussions with European partners may be strained. Speaking at a press conference at the G7 summit in Japan, Juncker said: I\u2019m reading in [the] papers that Boris Johnson spent part of his life in Brussels. It\u2019s time for him to come back to Brussels, in order to check in Brussels if everything he\u2019s telling British people is in line with reality. I don\u2019t think so, so he would be welcome in Brussels at any time. Asked whether the European institutions would be able to work with Johnson if he took over in Downing Street, he replied: The atmosphere of our talks would be better if Britain is staying in the European Union. Donald Tusk, the president of the European council who is also at the G7 summit, added: We have to respect every democratic decision, the result of the referendum and possible political consequences of the referendum. But I think it\u2019s quite normal to have normal relations with politicians and at the same time to have your own opinion about their opinions. The leaders are due to be treated this afternoon to a display of self-driving cars. What could possibly go wrong? A Cameron adviser tells me that while Europe is not on the agenda we can expect it to be raised in the margins. The British prime minister highlighted that all the G7 leaders have expressed their view on Brexit \u2013 and all have suggested it would damage the world economy \u2013 but he may be looking for more support while in Japan. Angela Merkel hadn\u2019t said much for a long time. The PM told me that his priorities while here were the fight against Daesh (Isis) in Syria and Iraq, antimicrobial resistance \u2013 which he said was a priority for him \u2013 as well as maintaining pressure on Russia over the Minsk agreement and anti-corruption. The British prime minister David Cameron is leading a session on trade after lunch on Thursday, at which they are likely to discuss Chinese dumping of steel. Cameron said he was particularly keen to focus on talks with the presidents of the European Commission and Council, and the leaders of France, Germany and Italy on what more can be done on tariffs. The venue for the summit, Ise-Shima, is in lockdown. About 23,000 police officers have been deployed in areas near the venue, where many restaurants and businesses have also closed for the duration of the summit. Residents have been encouraged not to venture out, and some schools cancelled classes in anticipation of congestion caused by traffic restrictions. Several ships from the maritime self-defence force \u2013 Japan\u2019s navy \u2013 have been deployed off the coast of the summit venue, including the Izumo, the country\u2019s largest destroyer, according to Kyodo News. The Japan coastguard has sent 100 smaller vessels out on patrol. The security effort has even spread as far as Tokyo \u2013 300km away \u2013 where 19,000 police officers have been mobilised. Lockers and rubbish bins have been sealed in and around major railway stations in the capital. The economy The precarious state of the global economy \u2013 and the slowing of growth in China \u2013 will be top of the agenda over the next two days. The G7 leaders are not as one on the best way to tackle the issue. As Agence France-Press reports: One side, led by Japan, favours spending - government stimulus. The other, led by Germany, thinks the fiscal largesse of recent years needs to be brought under control \u2026 Expect a final statement that supports a bit of both stimulus and austerity, but offers a firm rebuke on currency manipulation. Brexit Also up for discussion is Britain\u2019s upcoming referendum \u2013 looming on 23 June \u2013 on whether to stay within or leave the European Union. As Justin McCurry reports: For David Cameron, who went straight into talks with Abe and Obama after touching down in Japan on Wednesday night, the summit will be an opportunity to win backing for his campaign to keep Britain in the EU, less than a month before the Brexit referendum. Abe and Obama have already voiced concern over a possible Brexit, but a unanimous show of support for Cameron, while unlikely to appear in the communiqu\u00e9, would make the long journey from London to Japan seem worthwhile. Terrorism A pressing issue after attacks in Brussels and Paris, leaders are likely to want to present a strong, united front against the threat. Justin Trudeau might also raise the plight of a Canadian hostage held by militant group Abu Sayyaf in the Philippines \u2013 in particular Canada\u2019s resolve, backed by the UK, that ransoms should not be paid to extremists. Refugees A key concern for European leaders, with European Council president Donald Tusk saying he had come to Japan to seek international support to ease the crisis: If we [at G7] do not take the lead in managing this crisis, nobody would. China China is not represented at the G7 summit, but the reach of Beijing will certainly feature, whether in discussion about the global economy or concerns over territorial disputes in the South China Sea. Already this week, Barack Obama has said Washington supports Vietnam\u2019s territorial claims against Beijing in the South China Sea and \u2013 without mentioning China by name \u2013 warned: Big nations should not bully smaller ones. David Cameron also warned China that it must abide by the outcome of international arbitration on its increasingly assertive territorial claims in the South China Sea \u2013 the cause of bitter disputes with the Philippines and other countries in the region. G7 host Japan is also embroiled in ongoing rows over disputed territory in the East China Sea. Leaders of the Group of Seven countries should begin their summit in central Japan today feeling spiritually cleansed after their morning visit to Ise Jingu, Japan\u2019s most sacred Shinto shrine. Their trip to the shrine, set in a 2,000-year-old forest, risked sparking the first controversy of the summit, with academics and other religious groups warning that Shinzo Abe could use the presence of Obama, Cameron and co at the site to further his conservative political agenda. After their morning stroll, discussions among the leaders of Japan, the US, the UK, Italy, Canada, France and Germany will quickly turn to the parlous state of the global economy \u2013 although one of the chief countries of concern, China, will not be present, of course. There is disagreement on how to pull the global economy out of its difficulties, with Japan persevering with a combination of pump-priming and monetary easing, while counties such as Britain retain their faith in austerity. There is little agreement on how to tackle recent fluctuations in the currency markets, with the US opposed to attempts by Japan to weaken the yen and give its exporters some much-needed breathing space. In the end, the G7 leaders will probably make do with a diplomatic fudge. With agreement on concerted action unlikely, the communiqu\u00e9, due to be released on Friday, is expected to encourage flexibility and allow member states to adapt economic policies to their own circumstances in the search for growth. Obama has arrived, pausing to wave at the kindergarten children lined up to wield flags at the leaders. Now he and Abe cross the bridge together for what will be Obama\u2019s final G7 summit. We \u2013 and Shinzo Abe \u2013 are still waiting for President Obama to arrive at the shrine. In the meantime, here\u2019s an earlier image of French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande crossing the Ujibashi bridge, which symbolises leaving the temporal world and entering the spiritual one. All the leaders bar Obama have now arrived at the shrine \u2013 the US president is expected imminently and he will cross the bridge into Ise Jingu alongside Abe. The official G7 programme has begun with a visit to Ise Jingu shrine on an overcast and humid morning in central Japan. Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe was greeted by Ise Jingu\u2019s head priest priest at shrine entrance. Abe and other world leaders will cross Ujibashi bridge, leaving the temporal world and entering the spiritual on their way to the revered centre of Japan\u2019s indigenous Shinto religion. A gravel path will taken them to main sanctuary, home of Amaterasu Omikami, the mythological empress from whom all Japanese emperors are said to be descended, although they will not be permitted to enter the inner sanctuary itself. Japanese officials said the leaders would not be taking part in any religious rituals. The idea, said a foreign ministry spokesman, is to give them a sense of the \u201cair, water, nature and atmosphere\u201d of the shrine. \u201cIse is the place to present the beauty of nature and the richness of our culture and long tradition,\u201d the spokesman said. Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, has arrived \u2013 along with Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, he is at the summit to represent the EU alongside the G7 leaders. The leaders are now being welcomed at the Ise Jingu shrine by Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe. This marks the official start of the G7 summit. Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau seems to be displaying his sensitive side - post-elbowgate - since arriving in Japan on Monday. He and his wife, Sophie Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau, celebrated their 11th wedding anniversary \u2013 which is actually on Saturday \u2013 on Tuesday with a trip to Meiji Shrine in Tokyo and a night at a traditional ryokan inn. Yesterday they went hiking in a forest near the G7 summit venue. Trudeau told reporters: This is the kind of work-life balance that I\u2019ve often talked about as being essential in order to be able to be in service of the country with all one\u2019s very best, and that\u2019s certainly something I\u2019m going to continue to make sure we do. All seven leader have now arrived, with German chancellor Angela Merkel, French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi landing in Japan this morning: British prime minister David Cameron arrived earlier and has already held a meeting with his Japanese counterpart, Shinzo Abe: Obama and Abe have already held a press conference in which the US president expressed his \u201cdeepest regrets and condolences\u201d over the suspected rape and murder of a Japanese woman by a worker at a US military base on the island of Okinawa. The two leaders agreed steps would be taken to address crimes by US military and American base workers on Okinawa. Earlier this week, Kenneth Franklin Shinzato, a worker at the US Kadena airbase, was arrested in connection with the death of Rina Shimabukuro. As my colleague Justin McCurry reports, the attack \u2013 which Abe labelled a \u201cdespicable crime\u201d \u2013 could have wider implications for US-Japanese relations: The case could frustrate the controversial relocation of a US marine base on Okinawa, which hosts more than half the 47,000 US troops in Japan and 75% of its bases. Most Okinawans oppose plans, agreed by Tokyo and Washington two decades ago, to move Futenma base from its current location in the middle of a densely populated town to a remote coastal area. The plan would require the construction of a new offshore runway that local people say would destroy the local ecosystem and increase the risk of accidents. Both leaders vowed to reduce the military burden on Okinawa, but there was no commitment to amending the status of forces agreement, which can make it difficult for Japanese authorities to investigate and prosecute crimes involving US servicemen and base workers. Talks between the seven leaders begin after the visit to the shrine, over lunch at the Shima Kanko hotel. This afternoon they will watch a demonstration of driverless and fuel-cell vehicles. The \u201cfamily photo\u201d opportunity mid-afternoon \u2013 expect to see the leaders don some kind of traditional clothing \u2013 will be followed by further talks until early evening, when the first day wraps up with cocktails and a working dinner. The agenda for Thursday begins with all seven leaders visiting the Ise Jingu shrine; that will be around 11am local time (just over an hour from now). The Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, is one of the shrine\u2019s most fervent devotees and its location nearby is thought to be one of the reasons behind the decision to host the summit in Ise-Shima, Justin McCurry reports: That Ise Jingu, actually a collection of 125 shrines dating back 2,000 years, is a place of beauty and contemplation is beyond dispute. But its role at the heart of the Abe-led Shinto revival would make a G7 leaders\u2019 visit more than a carefree stroll admiring the shrine\u2019s sprawling ancient forest and crystal-clear river. Abe and most members of his cabinet are members of the Shinto Seiji Renmei (Shinto Association of Spiritual Leadership), an influential lobbying group that counts more than 300 MPs among its members. The association has called for the removal of pacifist elements from Japan\u2019s US-authored constitution \u2013 a key Abe policy goal \u2013 increased reverence for the emperor, and a state-sponsored ceremony to honour Japan\u2019s war dead at Yasukuni, a controversial war shrine in Tokyo. The choice of venue is \u201cvery closely connected\u201d to Abe\u2019s strong ideological connections with Shinto and its revisionist political agenda, said John Breen, a professor of Japanese history at the International Research Centre for Japanese Studies in Kyoto. It is \u201ca perfect fit with his active involvement with the Shinto Seiji Renmei, and its aim of bringing Shinto into the heart of government\u201d, Breen added. While Abe has stayed away from Yasukuni shrine in Tokyo since his controversial pilgrimage there in December 2013, his frequent to Ise Jingu have formed the spiritual \u2013 and political \u2013 backdrop to his three-and-half years in office.

          "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has faced an extraordinary string of attacks from some of the most senior figures in the EU, one of whom described the prospect of him becoming prime minister as a \u201chorror scenario\u201d. Martin Selmayr, who is chief of staff to the European commission president, Jean Claude Juncker, lumped Johnson in with France\u2019s Marine Le Pen and the US presidential candidate Donald Trump in a provocative tweet. The message, in which Selmayr says \u201cit is worth fighting populism\u201d, has already triggered a backlash among out campaigners in Britain. The Vote Leave media spokesman Robert Oxley said of the intervention: \u201cUnelected bureaucrat working for unelected bureaucrat speaks.\u201d There was speculation that Selmayr\u2019s action might have been coordinated as it landed immediately after criticism from Juncker. The commission president accused Johnson of painting an unreal picture of the EU for the British public and said he should return to Brussels, where he previously worked as a journalist, to see whether his claims chimed with \u201creality\u201d. Juncker also hinted that if Britain\u2019s highest-profile campaigner were to become prime minister then his discussions with European partners might be strained. At the G7 summit in Japan, responding to a question at a press conference about Johnson\u2019s decision to compare the EU\u2019s aims to those of Adolf Hitler, Juncker said: \u201cI\u2019m reading in [the] papers that Boris Johnson spent part of his life in Brussels.

          "bodyText": "Both parties spent the morning shovelling their respective elephant poos. Labor\u2019s had been flung around by David Feeney who stumbled through an interview on Sky last night, was caught in a \u201cgotcha\u201d moment when he was not across Labor\u2019s policy on the schoolkids\u2019 bonus and \u2013 the cherry on the cake \u2013 left his talking points behind. Now, he didn\u2019t leave behind classified information or as the Daily Telegraph gleefully put it \u201ca policy blueprint\u201d, we can all tell what the talking points of the day are by listening to the politicians. But, the vultures are circling the \u201c$2.3m investment property\u201d man. Chris Bowen was out of the blocks early to clarify Labor\u2019s position: We will not be able to afford to bring back the Schoolkids bonus. The conundrum provided by Barnaby Joyce for his party is a tad more complicated. In the rural debate he linked Australia\u2019s live export ban to an increase in asylum seekers arriving by boat. Coalition figures spent the morning hosing down the implication the Indonesian government was complicit in people smuggling. According to Fairfax Media, Indonesia\u2019s former foreign minister Marty Natalegawa said any suggestion of a link between the ban and people smuggling was \u201cpatently false\u201d. \u201cAt best, it represents an over-analysis of the subject,\u201d said Natalegawa, who was foreign affairs minister at the time. Tony Windsor, who is running against Joyce in the seat of New England, used the statement to warn that Joyce is \u201cunfit to be a leader\u201d. He has insulted Indonesia, our nearest neighbour. Malcolm Turnbull barely batted an eyelid, standing metaphorically firmly by the deputy prime minister while physically standing next to him. You\u2019re being unfair to my good friend, the deputy PM here. Let me be quite clear about this. There is no link between the Indonesian government and people smuggling. That [banning live exports] did enormous damage to the cattle industry across Australia, but it was an incredible affront to Indonesia. Now, the only point that I want to stress is that our cooperation with Indonesia, in terms of stopping people smuggling, is very, very strong. It was Joyce\u2019s second day in the headlines after Johnny Depp suggested he was \u201cinbred with a tomato\u201d on Jimmy Kimmel Live! yesterday. News of Depp\u2019s marriage breakdown with Amber Heard broke today but Joyce knows when to hold back the boot. All seriousness, the one thing I will never revel in is any relationship breakdown, no matter what animosity that might be seen on the airwaves between Mr Depp and myself. \u2018Until you are an Aboriginal person, don\u2019t criticise me\u2019 Nova Peris abruptly announced her decision not to recontest her Senate seat on Wednesday, and on Thursday, Sorry Day, she delivered an at-times tearful speech on the reasons for the decision. It had been reported she was offered a job with the AFL but Peris said she wanted to spend more time with her children. Three years ago, I walked into parliament as a first Aboriginal woman and until you are an Aboriginal person do not criticise me for the decisions I have made. This isn\u2019t easy. It\u2019s hard. Andrew Bolt suggested in a column Peris could be described as going \u201cwalkabout\u201d \u2013 a racist stereotype \u2013 and Guardian Australia understands there has been anger from some of Peris\u2019s colleagues about her silence on the decision. Peris dismantled any criticism: I may be leaving but I am leaving on my terms and I want to make this clear \u2013 no one should judge me. I am an inherited Aboriginal women with strengths and resilience that I have had to endure for 45 years. And it\u2019s not easy to wake up every morning and bounce out of bed and pretend that life is fantastic. Because it isn\u2019t. Aboriginal people have no inherited wealth. They have inherited pain. \u2018You know what eating that is called?\u2019 Shorten was in Darwin with Peris when she spoke to media and will be campaigning there for a couple of days while Turnbull was in Rockhampton with none other than Barnaby Joyce. But it was a mutual rescue mission day as Joyce made sure there was not another incarnation of the infamous Tony Abbott onion-eating fiasco. Turnbull was inspecting sweet potatoes when a crowd member asked him if he would like a bite, Joyce heroically intervened. You know what eating that is called? A possible end to your political career. The pair had a photo opp with some children and farm animals, forced as politicians are into ignoring the old adage. Four-year-old twins Orlando and Presley Acton were on hand to look cute and comfortable next to Turnbull but were unimpressed, according to AAP. Presley: This is so silly. Orlando: I was scared because those lights were getting in my eyes. Was the resulting photo worth the pain? Meanwhile, Kyle Sandilands\u2019 surprise endorsement of Shorten continued to reverberate: Best of Bowers Further reading There are lots of ways to say sorry, but Indigenous Australians need a treaty now, Paul Daley reflects on Sorry Day and what Indigenous people really need from whitefellas Millennials don\u2019t want selfies and emojis, they want change (Fairfax Media) \u201cThe usual approach to millennials rankles this (relatively) youthful voter because too often it is the only attention we get. The cutesy sops are sprinkled within a mainstream political culture that largely ignores young voters and their aspirations, then is surprised when they don\u2019t register to vote, don\u2019t engage or drift away from the major parties and vote for the Greens or someone else entirely.\u201d How I (almost) got the scoop on Turnbull that would have destroyed his career (news.com.au), Charles Firth writes about his encounter with Turnbull when Firth was an aspiring young journo. And also ... An astrophysicist who has seized every opportunity his parents did not get has given the University of Tasmania its largest ever private donation \u2013 $2.6m. The Examiner has the wonderful story about Dr David Warren. My dad was a tradesman who spent 30 years painting the white lines on the roads. He was pulled out of high school at the age of 12 to work in his parent\u2019s guest house, and always resented not having any further education. Meanwhile, in the rest of the world ... Barack Obama on Friday becomes the first US president to visit Hiroshima \u2013 but he ain\u2019t sorry. Obama will lay flowers at a cenotaph to the 140,000 people who died after the US dropped an atomic bomb on the city in August 1945 but will not apologise for America\u2019s actions during the second world war. Obama is in the area for the G7 and is meeting the Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe, German chancellor Angela Merkel, UK prime minister David Cameron, French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau and Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi for talks which will cover: the global economy and trade international terrorism the refugee crisis climate change North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons programme Chinese claims in the South China Sea And if today was a pop song ... David Feeney and Barnaby Joyce could probably use some cheer right now so here\u2019s the Flaming Lips\u2019 Bad Days dedicated to them. Remember boys, all your bad days will eventually end.

The government was leaping off an old press release, from 5 May, which made its way to the Telegraph this morning. Then Scott Morrison and Mathias Cormann held a media conference at midday to rail against Labor\u2019s plans for more debt and deficit. They went in with a figure of a $67bn blowout over four years, which extrapolated to 10 years produced a $200bn blowout. By the end of a bit of questioning, the figure had come down to $32bn. Tony Burke didn\u2019t miss in his reply, saying they came in like helium balls and finished completely deflated. </p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/24/nova-peris-resigns-from-the-senate-after-reports-she-was-seeking-afl-job\">Nova Peris resigned</a> from the Senate after just one term. A replacement, hopefully an Indigenous woman, will be on the agenda for ALP national executive. There is little chance it will mirror Julia Gillard\u2019s captain\u2019s pick. </p> <p>\u2022 Malcolm Turnbull was campaigning in Corangamite on mobile phone blackspots while Bill Shorten was in Perth, campaigning in Burt for Labor candidate Matt Keogh.</p> <p>\u2022 Tomorrow, Bill Shorten is in Melbourne. I have yet to find out where Turnbull is. In the evening, I can hardly wait for the debate between Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce, Greens leader Richard Di Natale and Labor\u2019s agriculture spokesman Joel Fitzgibbon.</p> <p>Thanks for reading today and thanks to Mike Bowers, currently somewhere between Perth and Melbourne.<br>Goodnight. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5743e22ce4b0eebe5b628015\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-24T05:27:36.179Z\">6.27am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back to <strong>Tony Burke</strong>. Because we can, in this lull.</p> <p>He was making a couple more points. </p> <p>One was the contrast between the major promises from Labor and the Coalition. That is, the Coalition\u2019s $50bn business tax cut promise v Labor\u2019s $50bn Gonski education and health promise. (This was the question this morning that I flagged.)</p> <p>Burke put it this way:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We\u2019ve got two parties here in this election campaign where both sides have major commitments that will cost the budget $50bn. The Turnbull government says that $50bn should be spent on tax cuts for big business. Labor says the $50bn should be spent on schools and on Medicare. These are the choices that are made.</p> </blockquote> <p>His other point is to defend Labor\u2019s choice NOT to make changes to negative gearing and capital gains tax retrospective, a decision which would make the budget bottom line better in the short term. (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/feb/17/negative-gearing-parents-may-have-to-choose-between-themselves-and-their-children\">This is the policy</a> that makes negative gearing for housing available only to new houses and makes people pay more capital gains tax on investment properties.)</p> <p>Burke says the reason governments have not made long- term structural reforms is because it is difficult. If it is done retrospectively, it hurts people. If it is not retrospective, it takes a while to raise money. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When you look at tough decisions that people have shied away from for a very long time, that do make a long-term structural difference \u2013 superannuation reform and reform of negative gearing and capital gains tax do fit that bill. They are both measures that both sides of politics for more than a generation have let stand and been unwilling to confront, and we\u2019ve had changes of government in each direction over that time. </p> </blockquote> <p>Burke\u2019s point is that the hard reforms need to be done and while they may not pay off in the short term, they will help the bottom line in the long term.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-05-24T05:35:27.692Z\">at 6.35am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5743df00e4b0d7feade1ce2a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-24T05:09:20.806Z\">6.09am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>I\u2019m told the <strong>Nova Peris</strong> replacement decision will most certainly go to ALP national executive. No captain\u2019s picks on this one. </p> <p>Names most mentioned include <strong>Malarndirri McCarthy</strong>, a former NT assembly member and journalist, and <strong>Marion Scrymgour</strong>, a former NT minister and deputy chief minister.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5743de2ee4b0e361e755cc83\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-24T04:55:21.878Z\">5.55am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Tony Burke</strong> is still going. He is cranky and he is one of those pollies that get very focused when he gets fired up. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What happened today in a media conference that started with so much arrogance and confidence and fell away into farce by the end, was simply an attempt by the government, by this Liberal government, to think they could get away with making up Labor policies, lying to the Australian people, and thought maybe, just maybe, nobody would notice. </p> <p>Well, message to Scott Morrison and Mathias Cormann: people do notice. And Scott Morrison\u2019s got more interviews to go later tonight. He can explain how they turned $224m into $19bn. He can explain why they deliberately inflate numbers from the Labor party. He can explain why fully costed policies get ignored, and they just go out and play their own games. The Australian people may be subject in the next few weeks to more lies like we saw in that media conference today. </p> <p>But we will make sure that this government is held to account every step of the way, because there\u2019s an alternative government doing the hard policy work and having an honest conversation with the Australian people.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-05-24T05:12:52.059Z\">at 6.12am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5743dd07e4b0eebe5b628012\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/katharine-murphy\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-24T04:50:26.454Z\">5.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>While Black Hole, The Musical, tapped-danced its way through the campaign day, the outgoing Reserve Bank governor, <strong>Glenn Stevens</strong>, has participated in a wide-ranging question and answer session with a business audience, one of his final acts as RBA governor.</p> <p>There were several interesting reflections. Stevens warned that whoever wins the election on 2 July will have their budget work cut out for them. Stevens noted somewhat delicately that the budgetary situation will be OK if nothing goes wrong locally or in the world. But downturn or no downturn, whoever wins on 2 July faces \u201csome years of quite hard repair work ahead\u201d.</p> <p>He rejected the need for a new system of inflation targeting, saying the current system worked well. He also argued a floating currency served Australia\u2019s economic interests: it was an important shock absorber.</p> <p>Stevens was asked how a central banker determines the direction of interest rates. He said it wasn\u2019t actually rocket science, it was just extremely data-intensive. He said the economy was like a giant jigsaw puzzle, and the central bank\u2019s job was putting the puzzle together in a way that makes sense. Then there was the calculation of whether acting improved conditions or whether it didn\u2019t. He declined the opportunity of commenting more specifically, telling his host: \u201cI can\u2019t shoot you in front of all these people.\u201d</p> <p>On China\u2019s economic transformation, he noted Beijing was \u201ctrying to manage a profound epochal transition\u201d and there was no textbook for how to do that, because no country had ever attempted the transformation that China is attempting on the scale it is attempting it. The threshold question: can the authorities in China land this transition, was \u201ca threshold question we will live with for some years.\u201d</p> <p>There was a muted warning on the housing market. He said households were carrying a lot of debt, and the field evidence suggested they were managing well enough, but the RBA always kept an eye on the leverage. Stevens also repeated a warning that housing prices went up and housing prices went down, and there were few easy roads to riches through highly leveraged holdings of real estate.</p> <p>Given the transition about to happen at the RBA, was he taking away some thoughts about organisational leadership? Yes he did have thoughts, as a matter of fact. The thoughts amounted to just get on with it. Stevens noted that the literature on leadership wasn\u2019t that valuable. His reflection after his time at the bank was simple: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s the leader\u2019s job to stand up and take the flak.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-05-24T05:41:40.634Z\">at 6.41am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5743dc6be4b0e361e755cc80\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-24T04:46:38.963Z\">5.46am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Tony Burke:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We might remember when [Turnbull] became prime minister, he claimed he was going to respect the intelligence of the Australian people.

Or perhaps not.<br></p> <p>If you watched the Four Corners episode last night, you will be aware of the many reasons why the public are losing faith in the political process. <strong>Blogmistress Katharine Murphy</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/23/transfield-boss-says-political-donations-bought-access-to-mps\">wrote up the newest part</a> of this sorry saga: <br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The managing director of Transfield Holdings, <strong>Luca Belgiorno-Nettis</strong>, says his company made political donations because \u201cit was fairly plain that that bought access\u201d to politicians and created opportunities to influence events.</p> <p>Belgiorno-Nettis told Monday\u2019s Four Corners program political donations were like the Latin saying Do Ut Des, \u201cYou give in order to have given back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think it was fairly plain that [donations] bought access in terms of the ability to simply be able to knock on the door and make the phone call and have the meeting with the political masters to voice whatever concerns that we might have, or indeed just to explore further relationships and further potential opportunities,\u201d said the prominent businessman, who has now renounced donations and founded the newDemocracy foundation.</p> <p>He also told the program it would be \u201cdifficult to deny\u201d that the company\u2019s political donations helped the company gain an unsolicited contract worth $750m to build the harbour tunnel in Sydney.</p> </blockquote> <p>Former NSW Liberal party minister, federal and state party fundraiser <strong>Michael Yabsley</strong> said he knew in some cases donors banned at the state level were sent to the federal Liberal fundraising body, the Free Enterprise Foundation. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/23/australia-must-reform-political-donations-trust-deficit\">Murph followed up with a comment</a>. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019ve been arguing for reform to the donations and disclosure regime <a href=\"https://meanjin.com.au/essays/the-politics-we-deserve/\">for many years</a> for two reasons: transparency manifestly benefits the public interest, and getting the money out of the system might help the political class focus on the interests of the people they are elected to serve: the Australian voters, rather than viewing politics as being little more than a series of arbitrations with cashed-up rent seekers.</p> <p>But Yabsley\u2019s point is the insider\u2019s point. He\u2019s focused on reputational risk: he thinks it has now gotten to the point where the rolling controversies around the political fundraising system is damaging politics itself, and also damaging the reputations of the players that seek to influence it.</p> </blockquote> <p>In terms of hoary old chestnuts, political donations is up there. It came up in 2009, when then Queensland premier <strong>Anna Bligh</strong> banned state MPs attending party fundraisers with business people and tried to stop business observers paying thousands of dollars in fees to attend the ALP national conference. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think it is time for us to really overhaul the entire system of political fundraising. It\u2019s gone down a certain path, it\u2019s been doing it for a long time, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any real hard evidence that it has resulted in any form of corruption. But I think it\u2019s just as much about people\u2019s perceptions. If the public feel that they are not getting influence in the same way that other members of the community are, then that is not a healthy democracy. So, let\u2019s look for a better way of doing it.</p> </blockquote> <p>It so happens at the time, a younger <strong>Malcolm Turnbull</strong> was federal opposition leader. He <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2009/s2644934.htm\">reassured the 7.30 Report\u2019s Kerry O\u2019Brien</a> that he was in favour of reform on campaign finance.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>They know that there is a Leader of the Opposition, a leader of the Liberal Party, who is passionately committed and has been for many years to root and branch campaign finance reform. So I\u2019m - I will be a willing partner in bi-partisan reform of campaign finance. But we\u2019ve got to get on with it.</p> </blockquote> <p>Back then, the <strong>then</strong> <strong>prime minister Kevin Rudd</strong> was trying to get Labor\u2019s legislation through to cap the disclosure threshold at $1,000, ban political donations from overseas or from non-Australian companies and reduce disclosure timeframes from 12 months to six months. The Liberal party blocked it in the senate.</p> <p>But there was one other thing Turnbull told O\u2019Brien:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I do not believe businesses and companies or trade unions should be allowed to donate to political parties.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-574384e6e4b0eebe5b627fd9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-23T22:35:18.191Z\">11.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>That\u2019s it from me, <strong>Melissa Davey</strong>, thanks to those who joined me for all the fun from 6am.

As a proportion of funding the service will see around 400 fewer people each year when they already turn away over 1,200 people annually.</p> <p>Community legal centres receive a small fraction of total legal assistance spending, and modest additional funding announced after the budget to be shared with other legal assistance services and family relationship centres will be swamped by the broader cuts that will come on top of chronic underfunding.</p> <p>In July 2017, community legal centres nationally will be cut by 30 percent, receiving just $30.1m under the national partnership on legal assistance services.

We need to see assertive responses to this. </p> </blockquote> <p>Mendoza said he was disappointed that no government had committed to funding and opening 12 regional response centres across the country, as recommended by the national mental health commission. The regional centres would be centres of excellence tasked with collecting good data from regions about suicide rates, and would look at population health interventions and regionally relevant solutions to prevent suicide in those areas. The centres would also educate people on how to respond to someone around them who might be depressed and suicidal.</p> <p>The decline in manufacturing and other resource jobs has meant job security and income levels in some regions have taken a serious hit, Mendoza said.

          "bodyText": "I\u2019m afraid technical issues have beaten us at about the same time the political day has slid to an end. \u2022 Today, the political debate has been dominated by Coalition\u2019s attempt to muddy Labor\u2019s budget costings. The government was leaping off an old press release, from 5 May, which made its way to the Telegraph this morning. Then Scott Morrison and Mathias Cormann held a media conference at midday to rail against Labor\u2019s plans for more debt and deficit. They went in with a figure of a $67bn blowout over four years, which extrapolated to 10 years produced a $200bn blowout. By the end of a bit of questioning, the figure had come down to $32bn. Tony Burke didn\u2019t miss in his reply, saying they came in like helium balls and finished completely deflated. \u2022 Nova Peris resigned from the Senate after just one term. A replacement, hopefully an Indigenous woman, will be on the agenda for ALP national executive. There is little chance it will mirror Julia Gillard\u2019s captain\u2019s pick. \u2022 Malcolm Turnbull was campaigning in Corangamite on mobile phone blackspots while Bill Shorten was in Perth, campaigning in Burt for Labor candidate Matt Keogh. \u2022 Tomorrow, Bill Shorten is in Melbourne. I have yet to find out where Turnbull is. In the evening, I can hardly wait for the debate between Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce, Greens leader Richard Di Natale and Labor\u2019s agriculture spokesman Joel Fitzgibbon. Thanks for reading today and thanks to Mike Bowers, currently somewhere between Perth and Melbourne. Goodnight. Back to Tony Burke. Because we can, in this lull. He was making a couple more points. One was the contrast between the major promises from Labor and the Coalition. That is, the Coalition\u2019s $50bn business tax cut promise v Labor\u2019s $50bn Gonski education and health promise. (This was the question this morning that I flagged.) Burke put it this way: We\u2019ve got two parties here in this election campaign where both sides have major commitments that will cost the budget $50bn. The Turnbull government says that $50bn should be spent on tax cuts for big business. Labor says the $50bn should be spent on schools and on Medicare. These are the choices that are made. His other point is to defend Labor\u2019s choice NOT to make changes to negative gearing and capital gains tax retrospective, a decision which would make the budget bottom line better in the short term. (This is the policy that makes negative gearing for housing available only to new houses and makes people pay more capital gains tax on investment properties.) Burke says the reason governments have not made long- term structural reforms is because it is difficult. If it is done retrospectively, it hurts people. If it is not retrospective, it takes a while to raise money. When you look at tough decisions that people have shied away from for a very long time, that do make a long-term structural difference \u2013 superannuation reform and reform of negative gearing and capital gains tax do fit that bill. They are both measures that both sides of politics for more than a generation have let stand and been unwilling to confront, and we\u2019ve had changes of government in each direction over that time. Burke\u2019s point is that the hard reforms need to be done and while they may not pay off in the short term, they will help the bottom line in the long term. I\u2019m told the Nova Peris replacement decision will most certainly go to ALP national executive. No captain\u2019s picks on this one. Names most mentioned include Malarndirri McCarthy, a former NT assembly member and journalist, and Marion Scrymgour, a former NT minister and deputy chief minister. Tony Burke is still going. He is cranky and he is one of those pollies that get very focused when he gets fired up. What happened today in a media conference that started with so much arrogance and confidence and fell away into farce by the end, was simply an attempt by the government, by this Liberal government, to think they could get away with making up Labor policies, lying to the Australian people, and thought maybe, just maybe, nobody would notice. Well, message to Scott Morrison and Mathias Cormann: people do notice. And Scott Morrison\u2019s got more interviews to go later tonight. He can explain how they turned $224m into $19bn. He can explain why they deliberately inflate numbers from the Labor party. He can explain why fully costed policies get ignored, and they just go out and play their own games. The Australian people may be subject in the next few weeks to more lies like we saw in that media conference today. But we will make sure that this government is held to account every step of the way, because there\u2019s an alternative government doing the hard policy work and having an honest conversation with the Australian people. While Black Hole, The Musical, tapped-danced its way through the campaign day, the outgoing Reserve Bank governor, Glenn Stevens, has participated in a wide-ranging question and answer session with a business audience, one of his final acts as RBA governor. There were several interesting reflections. Stevens warned that whoever wins the election on 2 July will have their budget work cut out for them. Stevens noted somewhat delicately that the budgetary situation will be OK if nothing goes wrong locally or in the world. But downturn or no downturn, whoever wins on 2 July faces \u201csome years of quite hard repair work ahead\u201d. He rejected the need for a new system of inflation targeting, saying the current system worked well. He also argued a floating currency served Australia\u2019s economic interests: it was an important shock absorber. Stevens was asked how a central banker determines the direction of interest rates. He said it wasn\u2019t actually rocket science, it was just extremely data-intensive. He said the economy was like a giant jigsaw puzzle, and the central bank\u2019s job was putting the puzzle together in a way that makes sense. Then there was the calculation of whether acting improved conditions or whether it didn\u2019t. He declined the opportunity of commenting more specifically, telling his host: \u201cI can\u2019t shoot you in front of all these people.\u201d On China\u2019s economic transformation, he noted Beijing was \u201ctrying to manage a profound epochal transition\u201d and there was no textbook for how to do that, because no country had ever attempted the transformation that China is attempting on the scale it is attempting it. The threshold question: can the authorities in China land this transition, was \u201ca threshold question we will live with for some years.\u201d There was a muted warning on the housing market. He said households were carrying a lot of debt, and the field evidence suggested they were managing well enough, but the RBA always kept an eye on the leverage. Stevens also repeated a warning that housing prices went up and housing prices went down, and there were few easy roads to riches through highly leveraged holdings of real estate. Given the transition about to happen at the RBA, was he taking away some thoughts about organisational leadership? Yes he did have thoughts, as a matter of fact. The thoughts amounted to just get on with it. Stevens noted that the literature on leadership wasn\u2019t that valuable. His reflection after his time at the bank was simple: It\u2019s the leader\u2019s job to stand up and take the flak. Tony Burke: We might remember when [Turnbull] became prime minister, he claimed he was going to respect the intelligence of the Australian people. Today his treasurer and his finance minister thought they could get away with treating the Australian people like fools. Today, his treasurer and his finance minister started out at the beginning of a media conference, all puffed up like helium balloons, and by the end of the media conference you\u2019d watched the air run out of them completely. Tony Burke uses the example of foreign aid. Labor\u2019s policy involves a commitment of $224m but Scott Morrison claimed its foreign aid commitment cost $19bn. Can I give Liberals a hint, says Burke. During the campaign, Liberal policies will be announced by the Liberal party, Labor policies will be announced by the Labor party. Tony Burke now, on the Scott Morrison-Mathias Cormann press conference. We watched the two people meant to be in charge of accuracy for our nation basically blindfolded and throwing darts at the Labor party. Labor\u2019s deputy leader, Tanya Plibersek, is doing a doorstop in Darwin. She says \u201cit\u2019s a bit rich\u201d for Scott Morrison to talk about costings when he refused to say in his budget how much his tax cuts would cost the budget. Plibersek was talking about the business tax cuts, worth $48bn over 10 years. Former Labor senator Trish Crossin, who was bumped by Julia Gillard in favour of Nova Peris, has spoken to Joe Kelly at the Oz. It was in chaos the minute Gillard terminated my career on the 21st of January 2013. It was a misjudgment and it was a mistake because the process was at fault. There was a process in the branch which is a rank and file ballot and the members never get it wrong. The members know who you are and they know your commitment and they are also mindful of whether you are male or female, indigenous or non indigenous. But this is what happens when you override a democracy. Unfortunately, there is very little time to have a thorough process and so Bill Shorten needs to consult as best he can and as widely as he can the members of the NT branch about who the replacement should be. Crossin said Peris\u2019 legacy was left wanting. I think that\u2019s for other people to judge, but I do believe that the first female indigenous parliament member needed to leave a legacy. And I don\u2019t think this is the sort of legacy I\u2019m referring to. One more thing out of the Penny Wong presser. She was asked about a federal corruption body and Labor\u2019s view on it. You might recall we did endorse or support the Senate inquiry to consider it. There have been a number of propositions around how you might strengthen your integrity framework in terms of Commonwealth legislation. We certainly are open to consideration of those and that\u2019s one reason why we supported the inquiry. Wong was talking about the inquiry by Dio Wang and John Madigan which I have written about here. Wong is asked about Clive Palmer not contesting the Senate. Essentially she did not really worry about Palmer but she mentioned Pauline Hanson running for a Senate seat. Wong said there had been some commentary suggesting Hanson was in with a chance. Wong has spent a fair bit of time arguing against her views. Penny Wong is asked about Labor\u2019s costings: The first point is this \u2013 if you want to find out what Labor policies cost then it would be useful to talk to the Labor party and not to Mathias Cormann. It is the interesting how desperate this government is to talk about us rather than them. I suppose if you\u2019re led by a man who used to believe in climate change and now is prepared to do whatever the climate sceptics want, you want to talk about anything other than what you really want to do. But how desperate are they to talk about us rather than them? I hope at some point Malcolm Turnbull will tell the Australian people what he believes in rather than what he says Bill Shorten wants to do. Wong turns to the Morrison-Cormann press conference. She calls it a debacle, which began with one number and ended with another number. Wong says all we learned is the ministers are prepared to \u201cmake things up\u201d. Labor\u2019s finance spokesman, Tony Burke, will holding a doorstop shortly. Now she is on to the federal Liberal fundraising body the Free Enterprise Foundation and the revelations on Four Corners last night. Wong says it \u201cbeggars belief\u201d that Michael Yabsley knew about the political donations going to the FEF and that Arthur Sinodinos did not, when he was honorary treasurer of the party. He claims he didn\u2019t know what was happening. Well, it\u2019s simply beggars belief that Michael Yabsley knew about it but Arthur Sinodinos didn\u2019t. Mr Turnbull should answer the question about senator Sinodinos\u2019s knowledge; he should require that Senator Sinodinos be full and frank in his explanation about his knowledge at all times. Labor\u2019s campaign spokeswoman and leader of the senate, Penny Wong is up now. She calls Nova Peris a \u201ctrail blazer\u201d and a \u201cchampion of change\u201d in her career for her people. We wish her all the best in whatever she chooses. This is a black hole kinda day. The Coalition is concentrating on Labor\u2019s budgeting, first with a $67bn figure and then after much questioning, admitted it could be $32bn. The government seems to have gathered anything Labor has ever been concerned about and thrown it into a basket, pushed it through a spend-o-meter and come up with a chart. Gareth Hutchens is putting together a more comprehensive list but the hard part about these costings is that we don\u2019t know what the assumptions are. More to come. Labor Indigenous senator Nova Peris has resigned after only one term of office in the Senate. She was Julia Gillard\u2019s captain\u2019s pick but she said she never planned to be a career politician. Peris said she discussed it with her family and would not be commenting further. Malcolm Turnbull announced $60m more in funding for mobile black spots in the electorate of Corangamite in Victoria. Bill Shorten underlined a previous plan to \u201censhrine\u201d Medicare in public hands in legislation. Phew. Matt Hatter is back. This is interesting regarding political donations. Indi independent Cathy McGowan has her campaign donations in real time. Her site lists the donor but not the amount. The public can see she has raised $86,676 with a goal of $185,000. It is an interesting model, which I have not seen on any other politician\u2019s site. Let me know via the Twits or below if you know of others. One more chart for you. Meanwhile in Perth. There may be a black hole in your black hole? Not at all. These are measures that Labor have said they oppose. Until they say they support them, it\u2019s for Labor to clarify. Worst case scenario is $67bn, best case is a $32bn black hole. Either way Australians will pay more for what Labor is claiming at this election. They\u2019ll pay it more in higher taxes than what Labor will admit to. They\u2019ll pay more in terms of higher deficits and higher debt. We have seen this all before from Labor and I think the Australian people understand that. We have a confirmation of the leaders\u2019 debate on Sunday night, televised through the ABC and moderated by Chris Uhlmann, the ABC\u2019s political editor. There will also be three other journalists asking questions. Morrison and Cormann\u2019s press conference continues. There is vigorous debate between the gallery and the ministers over where the numbers came from. We have been provided with a long list of spending commitments, which journalists are poring through now. The ministers are looking vaguely awkward. I hope to have some pictures for you shortly and am trying to bring the list to you in a format that is compatible and readable. Scott Morrison has a chart. Over the next four years, and the chart sets it out here, over the next four years using consistent methodologies that are used in the budget, Labor have identified $16bn in budget improvements, which comprises $14bn in higher taxes, and $2bn in savings measures. So seven times what they\u2019re raising in taxes over what they\u2019re doing in spending. Those higher taxes, that $14bn, that includes them not proceeding with the tax cuts for small- and medium-sized businesses over the next four year, their houses tax changes on negative gearing, and capital gains tax. It also includes their other measure on superannuation and multinationals, some of which are similar to what the government proposes. None of these additional taxes are being used to reduce the deficit. All of these additional taxes are being used to chase higher and higher levels of public spending. We are on to black holes. The treasurer and finance minister in stereo yelling about Labor\u2019s black holes. $67bn black holes. Labor is making promises to spend money that simply isn\u2019t there ... They will increase the debt and they will increase the deficit. They have a chart. Here is the Nova Peris story from my colleague Helen Davidson. Shorten is asked: If you are so angry about the AFP raids on Labor offices, why not commit if you form government to reforming laws to allow some public interest defence in leaking information? We will make that commitment ... I do think this is a matter which deserves attention. I am scandalised the government is going to such efforts to cover up their poor performance in the national broadband network, the fact that under Mr Turnbull internet speeds in Australia have dropped from 30th to 60th. The fact he promised before the last election it would cost $29bn and now it\u2019s at $56bn and climbing. This is the biggest commonwealth infrastructure project which we have ever done. It\u2019s the only real thing that Mr Turnbull has been charge of in public life, other than being PM, and the extent the government will go to to suppress Mr Turnbull\u2019s embarrassment and exposure over his incompetence is staggering. So the point you say about whistleblower protection, Labor is absolutely in the market to start strengthening whistleblower protection in this country, full stop. The Medicare legislation essentially would place a \u201cstatement of principle\u201d that Medicare remains in public hands that reflects the intention of the parliament. It was first released in the budget reply speech. Remember that? Feels like a long time ago but it was only three weeks. Bill Shorten says Labor will legislate a \u201cMedicare guarantee\u201d to protect Medicare for future generations. He promises to: abolish Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s \u201cGP tax by stealth\u201d. scrap the \u201cprice hikes to prescription medicine which will mean that for an average family with two healthy children they will save up to $400 a year\u201d. And, enact a specific act of Parliament which will prohibit the privatisation of Medicare into the future. If Labor is elected on July2, within 100 days we will pass a special act of Parliament to enshrine Medicare and protect it from privatisation. Our act will codify the importance of keeping Medicare in public hands. What does this mean? We will find out now. Bill Shorten is speaking up with Matt Keogh, Labor candidate for Burt (Perth). You will remember Keogh as their candidate for Canning, where the Liberal\u2019s Andrew Hastie won, a week after the leadership spill. Her full statement: After careful deliberation with my family, I have chosen not to re-contest my Senate seat in the upcoming Federal election. It is my intention that I will serve out my term and fully support and endorse my replacement for the number one position on the Labor Senate ticket, whoever that might be. As a Northern Territory Senator, it has been an incredible honour and privilege to serve and work hard for all of my constituents in the NT. As the first Aboriginal female in Federal politics as well as the Labor Party\u2019s first Aboriginal member in Federal Parliament I certainly had challenges, but none that I couldn\u2019t handle or was not prepared for, having already lived a very public and documented life. Australia is a great multicultural nation that I have been proud to represent \u2013 in sport and politics \u2013 over the past 16 years. I reject \u2013 like most Australians \u2013 the racism that Aboriginal people still have to contend with in this country. As a champion of change I will continue to fight racism and prejudice. I am pleased to see that the Labor Party has committed to affirmative action, endorsing six Aboriginal candidates for this Federal election. I look forward to witnessing my Uncle, Senator Pat Dodson, holding ministerial office. He would be a great Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. I wish our leaders Bill Shorten in the House of Representatives and Penny Wong in the Senate all the best as well as all of my caucus colleagues and mates for this upcoming Federal election. Special thanks to Mark Butler and George Wright for their vision and especially my own staff who supported me so well and also took up the fight for the NT. To the NT Labor party members, I\u2019m truly grateful for your faith in me which saw my 2016 Senate nomination elected unopposed for a second term. I had never envisaged myself becoming a career politician. I want to thank all the people who have made contact with me to thank me for my efforts over the past three to four years. I\u2019m now moving on and personally looking forward to the next chapter and journey of my life. I will not be making any further comments on my decision to not re-contest. Michael Kroger says he thinks it\u2019s more important for state leaders to be liked. Federal leaders just need to be respected. They respect Turnbull and that is what will win him the election in the end. Victorian Liberal president Michael Kroger is speaking to Sky. Even though the polls are close, Kroger says it is early days. At this stage I would still prefer to be in the coalitions position than in Labor\u2019s position. Kroger is asked if he is surprised at Shorten closing the gap. Yes Helen, but it\u2019s built on a lie. James Massola at Fairfax has an update on his story about the Greens leader Richard Di Natale and his payment of au pairs. Greens leader Richard Di Natale has failed to provide documents proving his family paid three au pairs a fair wage, despite promising to do so. And Senator Di Natale\u2019s office has conceded \u201ctimesheets were not kept\u201d to record the hours worked by the au pairs. I do like the view from here. The return of Abbott. I know you are all clamouring for it and Troy Bramston in the Oz has delivered. He has a column Abbott Ready If Turnbull Stumbles. The premise is that if the election is close, the conservatives will be revolting against the Turnbull ascendency. If the Coalition loses, obviously it is on and Abbott - in the abscence of any other jobs - is ready and waiting. Which you would expect, right? We are assuming that if Turnbull lost, he wouldn\u2019t hang around in opposition to hard slog it back to the prime minister\u2019s office. Here is Bramston\u2019s lead. The Liberal Party is so demoralised by Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s leadership that some in its upper echelons are now contemplating the previously unthinkable in the event of a shock election defeat: a return to Tony Abbott. The situation inside the Liberal Party is so volatile that if it doesn\u2019t win a convincing election victory \u2014 and at this stage the contest is too close to definitively call \u2014 the party will be engulfed in another bout of soul-destroying turmoil and Turnbull will be blamed. The column goes on to Shorten\u2019s effective campaigning, the poll leads, the squandering of Turnbull\u2019s lead and his wooden campaign appearances. Bramston canvasses the loss scenario. It is doubtful that the next two most senior Liberals, deputy leader Julie Bishop and Treasurer Scott Morrison, will be seen as viable leadership contenders. And it is too soon for the next generation: minister Josh Frydenberg and former West Australian treasurer Christian Porter. So, with the party reeling from defeat and there being no obvious leadership successor, all eyes will be on the re-elected member for Warringah. For Abbott, the irony is too delicious to contemplate now. But, sitting on the opposition benches, would Abbott spurn the opportunity to return? No. He never did and he never would. But everyone have a cold shower. It remains unlikely the Coalition will lose. Let us take stock. There are a few stories around we have not touched on yet. Bill Shorten is coming up in Perth for a doorstop and will then bring the pack east to Melbourne. Presumably Malcolm Turnbull is done in Victoria or at least we have no notifications of further events in the day. Labor\u2019s health shadow Catherine King is doing a policy on palliative care around lunchtime. Mark Di Stefano and Alice Workman of Buzzfeed have a story in which assistant multicultural affairs minister Craig Laundy distanced himself from Peter Dutton\u2019s comments about refugees last week. Buzzfeed reports Laundy rang a constituent in his very marginal and multicultural seat of Reid saying Dutton\u2019s comments were incorrect. University student Natassia Chrysanthos: [Laundy] said, Dutton\u2019s comments about people on the humanitarian intake taking jobs were factually incorrect on two counts: firstly, it\u2019s definitionally incorrect because the people he was referring to would be new Australians themselves and so they can\u2019t be taking Australian jobs.\u201d Secondly, the statistic is that within the first five years, only 9% of those from the humanitarian intake are in full-time employment. This statistic, he said, is a result of the system letting people down, however, not the people letting the system down.\u201d Laundy confirmed to Buzzfeed he made the call. He would not reveal what he said to Natassia. But Laundy has form, saying outrageously generous things about refugees. I say this to the Australian people: \u2018Put yourself in these people\u2019s position. lf you were faced with what they are faced with, would you put your life at risk to give your children a chance?\u2019. My answer is yes. The Greens are in Broken Hill, talking about water to the Barrier Daily Truth. The last question to the PM was whether he had spoken to Canadian PM Justin Trudeau about Canada taking refugees. Turnbull said he had not spoken to him on that issue and reiterated the point that the Coalition was stronger in this area. It is worth quoting at length because here, Turnbull is channelling John Howard, whose main argument is that to maintain a strong immigration program, governments have to be tough on the borders to ensure public confidence. Tony Abbott said the same thing, though with much more fist-shaking and tub-thumping. Literally dozens of (Shorten\u2019s) candidates, and including his parliamentary colleagues, do not agree with the position Mr Shorten takes, which he claims to be on a unity ticket with my government on this issue. You know, Kevin Rudd said the same thing in 2007. Kevin Rudd said he was going to be strong on border protection and turn back the boats and look what happened. I was Opposition Leader at the time, I begged him not to do so. I really begged Kevin Rudd not to do so but he pressed on because that\u2019s what the Labor Party believes, that\u2019s what the Greens believe, that\u2019s their constituency and we know what happened. 50,000 unauthorised arrivals, 1,200 drownings at sea and we\u2019ve had to set the border protection rules back to rights. We\u2019ve done that. But I can tell you it\u2019s a very serious, critically important responsibility of national security. Our multicultural society, which in many respects is our greatest achievement. How remarkable is it that we have such a harmonious society in a world with so much tension, that it depends upon a government being in command of the borders and the government determining who comes to Australia. I think it was Mark Riley from Channel 7 who asked this question - which cuts to the chase so far in this campaign. Q: The choice for voters, if I can put it simply, seems to be to take your policy which is $50bn of tax cuts for business, which will take sometime to work through their way through the economy or Labor\u2019s up-front payments to places where they can see work pretty well immediately, in schools and hospitals. Why should people wait? Turnbull: What Australians are concerned about is how do we ensure that we have a strong economy in the years ahead, how do we ensure our children and grandchildren in this time of unprecedented change and opportunity, but also unprecedented challenges, how do we ensure that we transition our economy in a way that delivers strong economic growth and jobs? We have a plan. We have a clear economic plan. Labor has no plan. Malcolm Turnbull is asked about the high suicide rates, covered in an earlier blog post. Q: Here in Corangamite the number of people who die from committing suicide outstrips the number of people dying on the roads. Will you commit to trying to lower that toll and signing a pledge from the National Mental Health Commission trying to reduce the impact of this? Thank you for raising that. Suicide is a national tragedy. It\u2019s something I am very keenly aware of. You may not be aware but my electorate of Wentworth includes The Gap at Watson\u2019s Bay which is the place in Australia regrettably where more people take their lives than anywhere else. Suicide and suicide prevention has been a very keen personal interest of mine and I\u2019ve come to learn a lot about it, particularly through my discussions with Professor Ian Hickie who talks and writes about what he calls the mental wealth of nations. There is no doubt that mental health or mental illness is an enormous - has an enormous cost on our community. A tragic cost, obviously on the individuals who take their own lives and on their families but also a huge economic cost as well. So yes, that is why we are putting more money than ever, particularly into frontline primary health mental health services. Headspace, as you know, Fiona is very familiar, in fact I might ask Fiona to talk about this because this is a gigantic issue in regional Australia and the mental wealth of Australia is a vital national priority. Rural health minister Fiona Nash also speaks. Neither minister or prime minister will say they will sign the pledge. Turnbull is asked: Q: The figure being spoken about today that\u2019s been based on everything Labor\u2019s expressed concerns about. It\u2019s not based on firm Labor policies, is it? I have all the details here. I don\u2019t think you want to go through them. From black holes to black spots. Malcolm Turnbull is in Corangamite announcing $60m for more mobile phone towers to increase connectivity in the bush. Turnbull gives a nod to the black hole, though the figure is now $67bn. He is asked when the Coalition will reveal its election costings. They will all be announced in due course but at this stage, if I may say so, the real issue is the flagrant wastefulness and recklessness of the Labor Party outspending us by 20 to 1 in this campaign, billion dollar Bill keeping on joking, making jokes about the spend-o-meter. Today, the government would like to talk about black holes. The Coalition are hoping that the gravitational field of the black hole rhetoric will drag in the substantial Labor policy work and make them disappear. If the electorate is talking about costings and budgets, it is fertile ground for the Coalition, even if the figures are a little rubbery. Official campaign spokesman Mathias Cormann has been telling everyone about Labor\u2019s $66bn black hole. He was asked how he costed that. Q: Of the $66bn, how much of that is Labor\u2019s actual policy and how much is a cost that you have attached to aspirational statements like that one about foreign aid? I have just explained it. There 18.1bn by fairly and squarely is the cost of measures that Labor is opposing,..where we need to pass legislation through the parliament. There\u2019s a bit more than $30bn which is the cost of promises that Labor has made which, these are their own numbers. Then there is about around about $35bn worth of savings that we have banked where Labor in one way or another has said we must restore that spending. Now, if Tanya Plibersek wants to come out today and say \u201cNo, they\u2019re no longer committed to restoring the funding cuts or the savings that we\u2019ve put in place\u201d, that\u2019s fine, we\u2019ll adjust the numbers but the people across Australia deserve clarity. They deserve to know what the numbers actually are. I mean, Labor has been ducking and weaving. Labor has been trying to fudge the numbers by interchangeably using 10-year projections and 4-year costings. Labor needs to come clean, what the cost of their promises is, over the 4-year estimates period and how they\u2019re going to pay for their currently unfunded spending promises. Shadow treasurer Chris Bowen on ABC\u2019s AM says meh. The fantasy that the government is putting about today just underlines the fact that they have no policy vision of their own. Now, we will not take any pious lectures from a government which has at the centrepiece of its budget a tax cut wouldn\u2019t tell the Australian people how much it costs and is completely and totally unfunded. That was the government\u2019s company tax cuts over 10 years, worth $48bn but not costed in the budget. Mike Bowers really is a pollie whisperer. He gets the best out of his subjects, none more so than in this series. Kim Beazley is often referred to as the best prime minister we never had. Shorten went to pay homage and get a little advice. Of course, he would have been alive to the hope that some of Beazley\u2019s popularity in the West would rub off. It is not often that a Labor leader hails from the West, though when they grow one, they tend to get it right. Two of Australia\u2019s best, John Curtin and Bob Hawke were from the west. Good morning and thanks for the donation, There was a glorious sunrise over Canberra, combined with a full moon so perhaps the stars are aligned for political donation reform. Or perhaps not. If you watched the Four Corners episode last night, you will be aware of the many reasons why the public are losing faith in the political process. Blogmistress Katharine Murphy wrote up the newest part of this sorry saga: The managing director of Transfield Holdings, Luca Belgiorno-Nettis, says his company made political donations because \u201cit was fairly plain that that bought access\u201d to politicians and created opportunities to influence events. Belgiorno-Nettis told Monday\u2019s Four Corners program political donations were like the Latin saying Do Ut Des, \u201cYou give in order to have given back.\u201d \u201cI think it was fairly plain that [donations] bought access in terms of the ability to simply be able to knock on the door and make the phone call and have the meeting with the political masters to voice whatever concerns that we might have, or indeed just to explore further relationships and further potential opportunities,\u201d said the prominent businessman, who has now renounced donations and founded the newDemocracy foundation. He also told the program it would be \u201cdifficult to deny\u201d that the company\u2019s political donations helped the company gain an unsolicited contract worth $750m to build the harbour tunnel in Sydney. Former NSW Liberal party minister, federal and state party fundraiser Michael Yabsley said he knew in some cases donors banned at the state level were sent to the federal Liberal fundraising body, the Free Enterprise Foundation. Murph followed up with a comment. I\u2019ve been arguing for reform to the donations and disclosure regime for many years for two reasons: transparency manifestly benefits the public interest, and getting the money out of the system might help the political class focus on the interests of the people they are elected to serve: the Australian voters, rather than viewing politics as being little more than a series of arbitrations with cashed-up rent seekers. But Yabsley\u2019s point is the insider\u2019s point. He\u2019s focused on reputational risk: he thinks it has now gotten to the point where the rolling controversies around the political fundraising system is damaging politics itself, and also damaging the reputations of the players that seek to influence it. In terms of hoary old chestnuts, political donations is up there. It came up in 2009, when then Queensland premier Anna Bligh banned state MPs attending party fundraisers with business people and tried to stop business observers paying thousands of dollars in fees to attend the ALP national conference. I think it is time for us to really overhaul the entire system of political fundraising. It\u2019s gone down a certain path, it\u2019s been doing it for a long time, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any real hard evidence that it has resulted in any form of corruption. But I think it\u2019s just as much about people\u2019s perceptions. If the public feel that they are not getting influence in the same way that other members of the community are, then that is not a healthy democracy. So, let\u2019s look for a better way of doing it. It so happens at the time, a younger Malcolm Turnbull was federal opposition leader. He reassured the 7.30 Report\u2019s Kerry O\u2019Brien that he was in favour of reform on campaign finance. They know that there is a Leader of the Opposition, a leader of the Liberal Party, who is passionately committed and has been for many years to root and branch campaign finance reform. So I\u2019m - I will be a willing partner in bi-partisan reform of campaign finance. But we\u2019ve got to get on with it. Back then, the then prime minister Kevin Rudd was trying to get Labor\u2019s legislation through to cap the disclosure threshold at $1,000, ban political donations from overseas or from non-Australian companies and reduce disclosure timeframes from 12 months to six months. The Liberal party blocked it in the senate. But there was one other thing Turnbull told O\u2019Brien: I do not believe businesses and companies or trade unions should be allowed to donate to political parties. That\u2019s it from me, Melissa Davey, thanks to those who joined me for all the fun from 6am. I\u2019m now handing over to Canberra\u2019s Gabrielle Chan to take you through the rest of the day. I\u2019ll leave you with this profile of 18 year-old Falla-Ricketts, the newly endorsed Greens candidate for Page. The party is hoping to capitalise on her local popularity and the strong anti-CSG sentiment in the community, writes Amanda King for Guardian Australia. The chances of her being elected are remote \u2013 the Greens won only 6% of first-preference votes in 2013, well behind the Nationals\u2019 Kevin Hogan, who narrowly beat the incumbent, Labor\u2019s Janelle Saffin. Both are standing again. The Greens hope to make some inroads. At the 2015 New South Wales state elections of 2015, the Greens came a close second to the Nationals in Lismore, which is part of the Page federal electoral district. Full piece here. See you at 6am tomorrow. While some have called for a return of the \u201cold Malcolm,\u201d and the \u201creal Malcolm,\u201d Mark Latham has written in the Daily Telegraph that he misses the old Bill Shorten too. \u201cWill the real Bill Shorten please stand up,\u201d he writes: Shorten is the first Labor leader in 50 years to go to an election without a plan for immediate economic and productivity growth. His tax policies are likely to damage the private sector at a time when consumer demand and investor confidence are fragile. Shorten has also moved Labor to the left with his embrace of the philosophical underpinnings of identity politics. There\u2019s some stuff about Marxism, Foucault and post-structuralism before he continues: Early in his leadership, Shorten promised to democratise the ALP and reach out to mainstream community involvement. But then he did nothing. The result has been a collection of kooky Labor candidates, unrepresentative of public opinion on key issues such as border protection. I have just caught the end of an interview with the federal finance minister, Mathias Cormann, on the ABC\u2019s Radio National, and it\u2019s all about \u201cjobs and growth\u201d. Host Fran Kelly has pressed him on the lack of health and education announcements in comparison to Labor. She asks him: \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you had the health and education ministers out campaigning every day?\u201d. Cormann replied that Australians wanted to know about how Australia\u2019s economy would be secured. The economic argument is very, very important for Australia\u2019s future. We have increased funding for health and schools which are guaranteed in our budget. But we are living in uncertain times. We\u2019re facing global economic headwinds and lower economic growth. It\u2019s important for people across Australia to know what our plans are for jobs and growth. When it comes to the budget of course, we\u2019ve got to explain what the risk is of the alternative. Bill Shorten makes unfunded spending promises without being able to pay for them [which will] ultimately drive up taxes for all Australians, and which will hurt jobs and growth. Cormann was also asked about the report in The Aus that the Liberals are \u201cso demoralised by Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s leadership that some in its upper echelons are now contemplating the previously unthinkable in the event of a shock election defeat: a return to Tony Abbott\u201d. Cormann replies the report \u201cis not accurate at all\u201d. We are totally focussed on earning the trust of the Australian people again to implement our plan of jobs and growth. The minister for foreign affairs and deputy leader of the Liberal party, Julie Bishop, will visit the electorate of Bonner in Queensland today. She will hold a press conference just before 9.30am. A spokesman for the Federation of Community Legal Centres, Darren Lewin-Hill, has just been in touch with me. He\u2019s perplexed that Turnbull is today announcing $60m for mobile black-spots in Corangamite. Lewin-Hill says: At the same time he\u2019s neglecting existing black-spots in free legal help and making them worse with more than $34m in cuts left in place in the federal budget amid a broader federal shortfall of $100m over four years. The cuts mean that coverage of legal help for serious legal problems including family violence will grow worse particularly in rural areas and even in major regional centres like Geelong. Without reversal of the cuts and a boost to funding, the Barwon Communily Legal Service will be forced to significantly reduce their services. They will also need to reduce appointments and casework conducted at their office. As a proportion of funding the service will see around 400 fewer people each year when they already turn away over 1,200 people annually. Community legal centres receive a small fraction of total legal assistance spending, and modest additional funding announced after the budget to be shared with other legal assistance services and family relationship centres will be swamped by the broader cuts that will come on top of chronic underfunding. In July 2017, community legal centres nationally will be cut by 30 percent, receiving just $30.1m under the national partnership on legal assistance services. The black-spots created and made worse by the federal government are denying free legal help to vulnerable people who can\u2019t afford a private lawyer and who can\u2019t get help from legal aid. Lawyers around the country rallied week as part of a campaign to reverse cuts to the sector. Greens leader Richard Di Natale has just appeared on Radio National. He\u2019s been campaigning in rural and regional areas, and is currently in Broken Hill. He\u2019ll be taking part in a regional leaders debate in Goulburn in NSW tomorrow night with Barnaby Joyce and Joel Fitzgibbon. Support for the Greens in regional areas was growing, Di Natale said, with issues like sustainable agriculture, renewable energy jobs and climate change important to those electorates. He said: You do find pockets [in regional areas] where Greens support is growing. Water is a major issue, of course climate change and dangerous global warming and water are connected. People understand, increasingly, the impact climate change is having. What we\u2019re seeing in the Lower Darling is a man-made crisis. It\u2019s completely mismanaged... it\u2019s a system in crisis. It\u2019s causing huge pressure on the local community. They\u2019re now resorting to bore water here in Broken Hill. Reporter Calla Wahlquist has more on the ABC\u2019s Q&amp;A program last night, featuring Pyne and Albanese. She writes that Pyne defended the direct action climate scheme pitting him against Albanese \u2013 although the pair ended up agreeing on many issues: Christopher Pyne has rejected a further suggestion that the Coalition\u2019s Direct Action climate policy could operate as a de facto emissions trading scheme, telling the ABC\u2019s Q&amp;A program the scheme was not intended to work that way. Pyne, the industry minister, and his regular sparring partner, opposition frontbencher Anthony Albanese, were the only two panellists on Monday\u2019s election special, which fell in week three of the eight-week campaign. The environment minister, Greg Hunt, dismissed questions at the National Press Club last week about whether the \u201csafeguard mechanism\u201d of the scheme could be triggered to require companies who exceed their baseline emissions to buy pollution permits, effectively turning it into a cap and trade scheme. Guardian Australia previously reported that an associate at Energetics, the firm which conducted the modelling of Direct Action, said the intended reductions could be achieved only by putting a lot more money into the emissions reduction fund or by tightening the safeguard mechanism. The idea was pushed further by Alan Kohler in The Australian on Monday, who said the Coalition\u2019s policy was a \u201csecret ETS [emissions trading scheme].\u201d When the question was raised on Q&amp;A, Pyne said he could not address the issue because he had not been told to read Kohler\u2019s column before the show. Labor voted with the Greens and the Coaliton to introduce the policy last year, but is campaigning on the basis of introducing a formal emissions trading scheme. Asked by host Tony Jones if his vote in parliament meant he would support theCoalition introducing a de facto cap-and-trade scheme, Albanese also deflected by saying he had not read the Kohler column. More on political donations. John Madigan, an independent senator for Victoria, writes that it is na\u00efve to think political donors don\u2019t expect something in return. In a comment piece for Guardian Australia, he writes: Australia\u2019s electoral finance regime is among the most liberal of all comparable political systems. Most democracies employ a mix of caps, bans on certain types of donor, expenditure limits and public funding to regulate the flow of money from private sources. However, in our federal sphere, there is no limit on how much can be donated to politicians (or the amount political parties can raise from donors). There are no restrictions on who can donate (not even foreign nationals, companies or governments are precluded from financing our politicians) and there are no limits on electoral spending. This free for all has given rise to an \u201carms race\u201d between the major parties, who now compete to outspend each other at elections while devoting ever increasing resources to raise the funds this demands. The lion\u2019s share of funding comes from private donors, leaving our major parties, in particular, increasingly reliant on this mix of large corporations, unions and wealthy individuals to remain electorally competitive. Guardian Australia\u2019s environment reporter, Michael Slezak, writes that an unprecedented level of coordination between climate activists and conservation groups is aiming to raise the profile of climate change in this year\u2019s election. Their tactics involve a combination of stunts, forums and an attempt to use members to have 130,000 conversations with voters before the election, he writes. I don\u2019t think the climate movement has ever worked together this closely in the lead up to an election campaign before,\u201d said Daniel Spencer a campaigner and media coordinator at the Australian Youth Climate Coalition (AYCC). The level of coordination between environment groups is, I think, unprecedented,\u201d confirmed Paul Sinclair, campaigns director at the Australian Conservation Foundation. Polling commissioned by the groups suggested their campaigns could have a significant impact on the election, with the majority of swinging voters saying they were likely to be influenced by parties\u2019 policies on climate change. Behind the scenes, the groups\u2019 tactics were being coordinated through a peak body, the Climate Action Network Australia (Cana), which liaises between the groups and coordinates their actions. The shadow treasurer Chris Bowen has just appeared on the ABC\u2019s AM program, talking deficits, political donations and polls. You can\u2019t get to budget repair without some spending, Bowen said. The difference of approach between us and the government is we have said very consistently both revenue and spending are part of the answer to budget repair. So the treasurer [Scott Morrison] is the one who says we can get back to balance just by cutting spending. It is fantasy. Asked if there needed to be reforms to the political donation system, including greater transparency, he said: Yes. Yes is the short answer to that. On the ABC\u2019s Four Corners last night, donations to political parties were exposed amid calls for overhaul in the political donation system. Dr Andrea Able, a political scientist and election integrity expert, told ABC News 24 this morning: The Four Corners program last night obviously brought up a lot of interesting points about the lack of regulation that the Australian political financing system at a national level has, and I want to emphasise we are talking here about the national level. So Australia is an interesting context because the states themselves have varying degrees of regulation, but at the national level there is almost no regulation aside from the fact that we have public subsidies to political parties and that political parties are required to disclose their spending, but not until a few months after the election. So, in the scheme of what this looks like in the global context of regulation, Australia sits at a very far-end of a laissez-faire system of regulation, and it\u2019s clearly not working. So as I mentioned earlier, Turnbull is in the marginal seat of Corangamite in Victoria. He\u2019s going to announce $60m to subsidise the construction of new mobile phone towers in areas deemed commercially unviable due to the lack of mobile coverage. About 6,000 mobile phone black-spots have been identified by communities in regional Australia. Meanwhile Shorten remains in Western Australia, where he and the opposition health spokeswoman Catherine King will announce $35m towards end-of-life care programs. The plan includes $22m for people to receive palliative care at home, and $9m to promote end-of-life planning. King says only 14% of people are able to die at home, despite around 70% of us wanting to do so. A Coalition of mental health experts are calling on the parties to implement a suicide prevention action plan to halt what is a crisis. Suicide rates have risen by more than 20% in the past two decades. Adjunct Professor John Mendoza, who is director of ConNetica Consulting and the former the former Chair of the National Advisory Council on Mental Health, told Radio National this morning: \u201cIn the lead-up to this federal election it is an opportunity to cal upon our major parties to spell-out what they\u2019re going to do in the next parliament to tackle this major problem\u201d. The figures are shocking: Between 8-10 Australians die by suicide every day. Mendoza says: Suicide now is responsible for more potential years of life lost than all cardiovascular disease. This is a real crisis. These are deaths on average at age 44. So baby boomers, Gen X, Gen Y [are all being affected]. We\u2019ve been largely silent in our [government] responses. We need to see assertive responses to this. Mendoza said he was disappointed that no government had committed to funding and opening 12 regional response centres across the country, as recommended by the national mental health commission. The regional centres would be centres of excellence tasked with collecting good data from regions about suicide rates, and would look at population health interventions and regionally relevant solutions to prevent suicide in those areas. The centres would also educate people on how to respond to someone around them who might be depressed and suicidal. The decline in manufacturing and other resource jobs has meant job security and income levels in some regions have taken a serious hit, Mendoza said. We need a social strategy for dealing with those communities hard-hit by downturns, he added. Lifeline: 13 11 14 Reports have emerged that Northern Territory Senator Nova Peris is the frontrunner to take up the AFL\u2019s top Indigenous job following discussions in recent weeks with AFL executives. The league\u2019s former head of diversity, Jason Mifsud, is now working with the Victorian Government as the executive director for Aboriginal Victoria. Former prime minister Julia Gillard described Peris\u2019s appointment to the Senate in 2013 as her \u201ccaptain\u2019s pick\u201d. She was the first Indigenous woman to be elected to federal parliament. Shorten was asked about the possibility of Peris leaving after his town hall in Perth last night and refused to rule it out, saying Peris would continue to make a contribution \u201cBe it inside or outside the parliament\u201d. He told the ABC: \u201cNova Peris is a very strong representative for the [Northern] Territory, and indeed all Indigenous Australians. She\u2019s made history on the track and in the Parliament. According to Fairfax: Should Peris take the job, the ALP would be forced to move quickly to select a new candidate for her Northern Territory Senate position before the federal election in July. The AFL, which is consulting with its Indigenous advisory group in making the key appointment, will relaunch its Indigenous round this weekend and the showpiece Dreamtime Game between Essendon and Richmond on Saturday night at the MCG in the name of Sir Doug Nicholls. Peta Credlin has weighed in on the apparent turnaround in Turnbull\u2019s popularity. The longtime chief-of-staff to former prime minister Tony Abbott described the latest polls, which show a boost to Shorten, as \u201ctroublesome for someone like Malcolm who likes to be liked\u201d. She told Sky News last night: Some politicians are pretty resilient. They don\u2019t need to be liked. Malcolm is a politician that likes to be liked. She said Mr Turnbull\u2019s decision to be interviewed by broadcaster Alan Jones on Wednesday was overdue and about time. You cannot expect to go to an election and win if you don\u2019t talk to the base and you must talk to Alan Jones and you must talk to Andrew Bolt. Here we go again. According to the Australian, the Liberal party \u201cis so demoralised by Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s leadership that some in its upper echelons are now contemplating the previously unthinkable in the event of a shock election defeat: a return to Tony Abbott\u201d. Columnist Troy Bramston writes: The situation inside the Liberal Party is so volatile that if it doesn\u2019t win a convincing election victory \u2014 and at this stage the contest is too close to definitively call \u2014 the party will be engulfed in another bout of soul-destroying turmoil and Turnbull will be blamed. I\u2019ve been surprised at the extent of the despair in Liberal ranks. You don\u2019t have to go very far to find it. Past and present MPs, party officials and staffers freely offer up criticisms of the Prime Minister and the Liberal campaign strategy unprompted. Many of these views are being aired on television, radio and social media, and in newspapers and magazines. On the campaign trial, Bill Shorten looks confident and is having fun. His issues are dominating: health costs, school funding, negative gearing, superannuation and penalty rates. His messages are sharp and his policies are understood. Labor\u2019s campaign is far from faultless but overall, it is winning the contest so far. Good morning and welcome to another day of the political campaign, Melissa Davey with you here to take you through until 8.30am. Or should I say, good mourning [expect more bad puns like this at 5am]. On Q&amp;A last night, an audience member, Rhys Whitelock, told the innovation and science minister, Christopher Pyne, that he was missing the \u201cold Malcolm\u201d. The Turnbull with moral convictions, who believed in climate change and gay marriage without a plebiscite, he said. \u201cI want the old Malcolm back,\u201d he lamented. \u201cThe old Malcolm who was more socially progressive, the Malcolm who crossed the floor on the emissions trading scheme, the Malcolm who was for marriage equality.\u201d Pyne responded with something off-topic about voluntary voting. But it\u2019s sentiment that\u2019s been expressed a few times in this election campaign. Voters, writes Charis Chang for News Ltd, want the old Malcolm back. I have a feeling this theme of old Malcolm vs new Malcolm is going to linger this campaign. But, asks the former New South Wales premier Kristina Keneally, is the old Malcolm missing in action, or hiding in plain sight? She writes for Guardian Australia: \u201cWho has a history of reaching desperately for the \u201cgotcha\u201d moment when the chips are down? Turnbull. Who gets desperate when he isn\u2019t feeling the love? Turnbull. Who will do whatever it takes to be PM? Turnbull. Maybe the real Malcolm isn\u2019t missing after all. Perhaps he\u2019s been there all along, hiding in plain sight.\u201d The big picture: Despite yesterday\u2019s polls which showed Shorten had gained significant ground, the Coalition would win the election should Australia head to the polls today, Phillip Coorey points out in the Financial Review. Labor, which won 55 at the last election, needs to win a net minimum 21 seats to govern in its own right. \u201cHave we got 21 seats in the bag? No we haven\u2019t,\u201d said a Labor strategist. \u201cBut the track is encouraging. We haven\u2019t put our cue in the rack.\u201d Said a Liberal strategist: \u201cIt is genuinely close, but at this stage, the retention of the government is more than likely.\u201d At the end of the second week of the campaign, three major opinion polls showed that, nationally, the race was locked in a statistical dead heat. So how important are polls at this point in the campaign, with a little under six weeks to go? As Coorey points out, the Fairfax/Ipsos poll had the Coalition leading Labor by 51% to 49% on a two-party-preferred basis, the Seven News/Reachtel Poll had them locked at 50%, and Newspoll had Labor leading by 51% to 49%. The Coalition won 53.5% to 46.5% last election. Strategists on both sides said while the major published polls were important, they lacked the specificity required at election time because different seats were fought on different issues and swings were never uniform. Back to Q&amp;A, and Pyne said he \u201cwelcomed\u201d the close polling results, because they \u201cremind people that they actually have to make a serious choice\u201d. And the shadow minister for transport and infrastructure, Anthony Albanese, said the results were a reflection of the apparent change in Turnbull\u2019s convictions. Malcolm Turnbull promised to treat the Australian people like adults,\u201d he said. \u201cNow when they look at Malcolm Turnbull, they hear Tony Abbott.\u201d Meanwhile, negative gearing has been a hot-topic of the campaign. Fairfax reports that a draft, rather alarmist report, intended to discredit Labor on negative gearing has been linked to a meeting involving the treasurer, Scott Morrison, and figures from the real estate industry. The report is full of errors. Fairfax explains: Research intended for use in a bid to discredit Labor\u2019s negative gearing campaign was commissioned after a meeting between Scott Morrison and a close friend and senior figure in Australia\u2019s property industry. But the draft report contains a series of factual errors and makes bold claims of a \u201cresale price cliff\u201d and \u201csocial dysfunction\u201d that have alarmed some in the real estate industry to whom it has been circulated. An email obtained by Fairfax Media shows Greg Paramor, the managing director of property company Folkestone, discussed the need for a study critiqueing Labor\u2019s policy with Brian Haratsis, the executive chairman of advisory firm MacroPlan Dimasi. Mr Paramor, who is a friend of Mr Morrison and former president of the Australian Property Council, made the request after his encounter with the Treasurer. A quote from the report: \u201cI am writing this as we go, and there are a number of references that you are looking at that won\u2019t be there in the final\u201d. Not exactly authoritative. Morrison has said he had nothing to do with commissioning the report. On the campaign trail: The opposition leader Bill Shorten remains in WA for another day, after holding a town hall last night where he was grilled on metadata and the price of downloading Game of Thrones. Turnbull is headed for Corangamite, held by Liberal Sarah Henderson on a margin of just under 4%, in Victoria. He\u2019ll announce $60m to target mobile pone black-spots, which are hurting small business. The campaign to watch: Let\u2019s stick with Corangamite. As the Herald Sun reports: It is a community bitterly divided over a $28.9m Torquay aquatic centre, which threatens to influence the outcome of the seat. And with the polls running narrowly in Labor\u2019s favour, every seat will be crucial. Ms Henderson, whose victory in the seat in 2013 was vital in Tony Abbott winning power, has attracted fierce criticism for demanding the Surf Coast Shire withdraw a proposal to slap a \u201cpool tax\u201d of up to $150 a year on all ratepayers. Torquay is among the most politically sensitive towns in the electorate, with just a handful of votes separating Liberal and Labor candidates at the town\u2019s two polling booths three years ago. The region is also under economic stress over the closure of the Ford manufacturing plant in Geelong and the dairy price crisis hitting farmers. And another thing(s): Government strategists suggest the national polls mask a rather different back story, writes Michelle Grattan for the Conversation. The Coalition is doing better in the marginal seats, they say, where its economic message is getting across well. It\u2019s the marginals in which elections are won and lost and what\u2019s happening there is of prime concern to the parties. The Liberals may be \u201cspinning\u201d or telling the truth \u2013 it is hard to know. Public polling done in marginals is usually very hit and miss, when tested against the later outcomes. The Coalition may have miscalculated Turnbull\u2019s appeal when they ousted Abbott last year, she added. But worrying for the Coalition, based on the Prime Minister\u2019s tumbling personal ratings in recent months, is that the Liberals may have miscalculated what would be Turnbull\u2019s electoral appeal when they installed him in September. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time that a party over-estimated what a leadership change would bring in terms of votes. Polling analyst John Stirton says \u201cleaders tend to be more popular in exile than in office\u201d, citing the Andrew Peacock/John Howard opposition experience through the 1980s. To Shorten, and First Dog On The Moon asks: What might life be like with opposition leader Burst Watermain as prime minister? A good point: On Q&amp;A last night, Pyne called for a few \u201cfact checks\u201d of a few of the claims made by audience members and Albanese. But as this Twitter user observes:",

Now does this mean it\u2019s in 10 to the 300th universes at the same&#xa0;time?\u201d</p> <p>Can billions of different universes coexist within one computer? That\u2019s the sort of question that is probably best not grappled with before midnight and without the aid of illegal stimulants. And in a sense, the answer doesn\u2019t matter. The more immediate and relevant question is whether or not this quantum computer works.</p> <p>At the moment quantum computing still resides within a largely theoretical or speculative realm. The potential is staggering, involving a computational power many times the order of all the world\u2019s existing classical computers combined. But realising that potential is a fiendishly difficult task.</p> <p>That\u2019s why D-Wave\u2019s 2X computer costs more than $15m and only a handful of organisations have so far bought one. Still, as those organisations include Google, Lockheed Martin and Nasa, and among D-Wave\u2019s investors are Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos and the CIA\u2019s hi-tech arm, In-Q-Tel, it\u2019s clear that some of the world\u2019s most forward- looking institutions believe that the computer has a future.</p> <p>In areas such as artificial intelligence and cryptography, it\u2019s thought that quantum computing will transform the landscape, perhaps bringing about the breakthrough that will enable machines to \u201cthink\u201d with the nuance and interpretative skill of humans.</p> <p>Brownell used to be chief of technology at Goldman Sachs. In that job there were few tech developments that he didn\u2019t have pitched at him. He believes that while social media successes like Facebook are clever utilisations of existing technology, the fact that Silicon Valley is constantly chasing profitable variations on the same theme means that it is no longer doing the really tough mental work. \u201cThe level of innovation is much, much less than we\u2019ve seen historically and probably at an all-time low in terms of the real world-changing innovations.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2015/jul/03/quantum-computing-science-podcast\">The potential of quantum computing \u2013 Science Weekly podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>D-Wave, he says, boldly bucks this trend. But that\u2019s not how he used to think. When he first heard about D-Wave seven years ago, the company had been going for nine years and, in some informed circles, was a bit of a laughing stock. His initial reaction when the company approached him was deep scepticism.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t believe it at first at all,\u201d he&#xa0;says, \u201cparticularly as there were all these blog comments with experts&#xa0;saying it was snake oil. I wasn\u2019t&#xa0;really interested.\u201d</p> <p>His attitude changed when he came out and met the team. D-Wave was co-founded by <a href=\"http://www.dwavesys.com/our-company/leadership\" title=\"\">Geordie Rose</a>, a 44-year-old physics PhD who, doubtful about academia, took a course in entrepreneurship. He was impatient with the research approach of highly expensive but severely limited laboratory experiments.</p> <p>Rose\u2019s novel idea was to build a functioning quantum computer with commercial appeal. But this is where the science starts to cause people to pull their hair out. Most experimental quantum computers that had been assembled in labs followed the universal gate model, in which qubits substituted for transistors, without any notable success.</p> <p>Rose chose instead to develop an \u201cadiabatic\u201d quantum computer, which works by a process of what\u2019s called \u201cquantum annealing\u201d or \u201ctunnelling\u201d. In essence, it means you develop an algorithm that assigns specific interactions between the qubits along the lines of the classical model \u2013 ie if this is a 0, that one is 1 etc. Then create the conditions for quantum superposition, in which the qubits can realise their near infinite possibilities, before returning them to the classical state of 0s and 1s. The idea is the qubits will follow the path of least energy in relation to the algorithmic requirements, thus finding the most efficient answer.</p> <p>If that\u2019s hard enough to explain, imagine how difficult it was to build. And the early results were not encouraging. No one seemed to be sure what, if anything, was going on at a quantum level, but whatever it was, it wasn\u2019t impressive.</p> <p>D-Wave\u2019s first demonstration in 2007 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2007/feb/08/guardianweeklytechnologysection4\" title=\"\">of its 16-qubit device</a>, which involved solving a sudoku puzzle, hardly set the world on fire. Umesh Vazirani, co-author of a paper on quantum complexity theory, <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/theinbox/2007/02/quantum_computing_3\" title=\"\">dismissed D-Wave\u2019s claims of speedup</a> as a misunderstanding of his work, and suggested that \u201ceven if it turns out to be a true quantum computer, and even if it could be scaled&#xa0;to thousands of qubits, [it] would&#xa0;likely not be more powerful than &#xa0;a cellphone\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Even if no one ever builds a useful quantum computer we still learn an immense amount by attempting to</p> <footer> <cite>Dr Nic Harrigan, Bristol University</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Thereafter the company was regularly accused of hype and exaggeration. Part of the problem was that it was very hard to measure with any agreed accuracy what was happening. D-Wave came up with a test to show that entanglement \u2013 seen as a necessary prerequisite for a working quantum computer \u2013 was taking place.</p> <p>But some experts doubted the reliability of the test. When D-Wave passed <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn23251-controversial-quantum-computer-aces-entanglement-tests/\" title=\"\">a different test, developed by an independent scientist</a>, sceptics argued that while entanglement might be happening, the only real test was&#xa0;performance.</p> <p>In 2013, the D-Wave Two was cited in one test as performing 3,600 times faster than a classical computer. But yet again <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn28641-experts-doubt-googles-claim-about-its-quantum-computers-speed/\" title=\"\">these results were rubbished</a> by several prominent scientists in the field. In 2014 Matthias Troyer, a renowned professor of computational physics, published a report that stated that he found <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/d-wave-quantum-speedup/\" title=\"\">\u201cno evidence of quantum&#xa0;speedup\u201d</a>.</p> <p>A longtime doubter of D-Wave\u2019s claims is <a href=\"http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/\" title=\"\">Scott Aaronson</a>, a professor at MIT, who has called himself \u201cChief D-Wave Sceptic\u201d. After Troyer\u2019s paper, he argued that although quantum effects were probably taking place in D-Wave\u2019s devices, there was no reason to believe they played a causal role or that they were faster than a classical computer.</p> <p>Brownell is dismissive of these critics, claiming that the \u201cquestion has been largely settled\u201d. He cites <a href=\"http://googleresearch.blogspot.co.uk/2015/12/when-can-quantum-annealing-win.html\" title=\"\">Google\u2019s comparative test</a> last year in which its D-Wave quantum computer solved certain problems 100m times faster than a classical computer.</p> <p>\u201cIf it isn\u2019t quantum computing,\u201d asks Brownell, \u201cthen how did we build something that\u2019s a hundred million times faster than an Intel Core? It either has to be quantum computing or some other law of nature that we haven\u2019t discovered yet that\u2019s even more exciting than quantum mechanics. I challenge any scientist in the world to tell us: if it\u2019s not quantum annealing, what is it?\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2016/mar/16/artificial-intelligence-we-should-be-more-afraid-of-computers-than-we-are-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4htcc\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2473833\"            data-video-name=\"We should be more afraid of computers than we are \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-56e8517ae4b040c94037c457\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/03/15/160315AlexHernCiF_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11324857&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/03/15/160315AlexHernCiF_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/03/15/160315AlexHernCiF_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/03/15/160315AlexHernCiF_small.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2016/mar/16/artificial-intelligence-we-should-be-more-afraid-of-computers-than-we-are-video\">We should be more afraid of computers than we are</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Even Aaronson acknowledged that the Google test was significant. \u201cThis is certainly the most impressive demonstration so far of the D-Wave machine\u2019s capabilities.

Nic Harrigan works at the <a href=\"http://www.bristol.ac.uk/physics/research/quantum/\" title=\"\">Centre for Quantum Photonics</a> at Bristol University, a leading research institute in quantum&#xa0;mechanics.</p> <p>\u201cAlthough there are incredible potential applications of quantum computing,\u201d Harrigan says, \u201ceven if no one ever builds a useful quantum computer we still learn an immense amount by attempting to. This might sound like ass-covering, but quantum mechanics itself is a theory so fundamental to our understanding of the universe, and is the seed to so many current and future other technologies, that anything we can do to understand it better is huge. Somewhat incredibly it turns out that a good way to try and understand what is actually going on in quantum mechanics (and just how it differs from normal classical physics) is to consider which kind of computational problems one can more easily solve using quantum mechanical&#xa0;systems.\u201d</p> <p>At Google they were cautiously optimistic about D-Wave\u2019s usefulness. The head of engineering, Hartmut Neven, <a href=\"http://googleresearch.blogspot.co.uk/2015/12/when-can-quantum-annealing-win.html\" title=\"\">outlined the strengths and weaknesses of the tests</a>, and acknowledged that while there were other algorithms that, if deployed on classical computers, could outperform quantum annealing, he expected future developments to favour quantum annealing. \u201cThe design of next-generation annealers must facilitate the embedding of problems of practical relevance,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The kinds of problems that quantum annealing might help address are all concerned with what\u2019s called optimisation \u2013 finding the most efficient model in complex systems.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/bt-partner-zone/2015/oct/28/how-cloud-computing-is-becoming-more-sustainable\">How cloud computing is becoming more sustainable</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cOptimisation sounds like a really boring problem,\u201d says Brownell, \u201cbut it\u2019s at the core of so many complex application problems in every discipline. Probably one of the most exciting is in the artificial intelligence world. Say you\u2019re trying to recognise a water bottle. It still takes computers an enormous amount of time to do that not as well as humans do. Computers&#xa0;are catching up, but quantum computing can help&#xa0;accelerate that process.\u201d</p> <p>He cites genomics, economics and medicine as other areas that are rich with optimisation problems. With conventional computers, creating complex models \u2013 such as, for example, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_methods_in_finance\" title=\"\">Monte Carlo simulation</a> used in the finance industry to analyse different interest rate scenarios \u2013 requires an enormous amount of computing power. And computing power requires real power.</p> <p>\u201cYou go to these big web properties and they have data centres that are installed next to hydroelectric plants because they consume so much electricity,\u201d says Brownell. \u201cThey\u2019re the second-largest consumers of electrical energy on the planet.\u201d</p> <p>D-Wave\u2019s vision, he says, is for a green revolution in computing, in which everyone will have access to much more energy-efficient quantum computers through the cloud. In a few years, he thinks, we\u2019ll be able to access quantum computing from our phones.</p> <p>\u201cI think we have the opportunity to create one of the most valuable technology companies in history,\u201d says Brownell. \u201cI know that sounds really grand, but based on the capability we\u2019ve built, we\u2019re at the stage to be the dominant player in quantum computing for decades to come.\u201d</p> <p>Well, any self-respecting CEO would say that. But it certainly seems that D-Wave are currently leading the&#xa0;quantum computer race. Where that race is going, what it involves and how many universes it\u2019s taking place in are, however, questions that we\u2019ll probably need a working quantum computer to answer.</p>",

          "bodyText": "Ever since Charles Babbage\u2019s conceptual, unrealised Analytical Engine in the 1830s, computer science has been trying very hard to race ahead of its time. Particularly over the last 75 years, there have been many astounding developments \u2013 the first electronic programmable computer, the first integrated circuit computer, the first microprocessor. But the next anticipated step may be the most revolutionary of all. Quantum computing is the technology that many scientists, entrepreneurs and big businesses expect to provide a, well, quantum leap into the future. If you\u2019ve never heard of it there\u2019s a helpful video doing the social media rounds that\u2019s got a couple of million hits on YouTube. It features the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, detailing exactly what quantum computing means. Trudeau was on a recent visit to the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, Ontario, one of the world\u2019s leading centres for the study of the field. During a press conference there, a reporter asked him, half-jokingly, to explain quantum computing. Quantum mechanics is a conceptually counterintuitive area of science that has baffled some of the finest minds \u2013 as Albert Einstein said \u201cGod does not play dice with the universe\u201d \u2013 so it\u2019s not something you expect to hear politicians holding forth on. Throw it into the context of computing and let\u2019s just say you could easily make Zac Goldsmith look like an expert on Bollywood. But Trudeau rose to the challenge and gave what many science observers thought was a textbook example of how to explain a complex idea in a simple way. The concept of quantum computing is relatively new, dating back to ideas put forward in the early 1980s by the late Richard Feynman, the brilliant American theoretical physicist and Nobel laureate. He conceptualised the possible improvements in speed that might be achieved with a quantum computer. But theoretical physics, while a necessary first step, leaves the real brainwork to practical application. With normal computers, or classical computers as they\u2019re now called, there are only two options \u2013 on and off \u2013 for processing information. A computer \u201cbit\u201d, the smallest unit into which all information is broken down, is either a \u201c1\u201d or a \u201c0\u201d. And the computational power of a normal computer is dependent on the number of binary transistors \u2013 tiny power switches \u2013 that are contained within its microprocessor. Back in 1971 the first Intel processor was made up of 2,300 transistors. Intel now produce microprocessors with more than 5bn transistors. However, they\u2019re still limited by their simple binary options. But as Trudeau explained, with quantum computers the bits, or \u201cqubits\u201d as they are known, afford far more options owing to the uncertainty of their physical state. In the mysterious subatomic realm of quantum physics, particles can act like waves, so that they can be particle or wave or particle and wave. This is what\u2019s known in quantum mechanics as superposition. As a result of superposition a qubit can be a 0 or 1 or 0 and 1. That means it can perform two equations at the same time. Two qubits can perform four equations. And three qubits can perform eight, and so on in an exponential expansion. That leads to some inconceivably large numbers, not to mention some mind-boggling working concepts. At the moment those concepts are closest to entering reality in an unfashionable suburb in the south-west corner of Trudeau\u2019s homeland. In a neat, spacious lab in Burnaby, a satellite of Vancouver, I\u2019m looking inside what appears to be a large black fridge about 10 feet high. Within it is an elaborate structure of circuit boards, not unlike the sort of thing a physics class might construct out of Meccano, except with beautifully colourful niobium wafers as the centrepiece. It all looks fairly unremarkable, yet somewhere in here a multiplicity of different universes are thought to exist. The lab belongs to a small company called D-Wave, a highly skilled collection of just 140 employees that prides itself on building the world\u2019s first functioning quantum computer, which is what is contained within the large fridge-like casing. Actually it is a fridge, the coldest fridge ever assembled. The cooling apparatus enables the niobium computer chip at its core to function at a temperature of just under \u2013273C, or as close to absolute zero as the known universe gets. The supercooled environment is necessary to maintain coherent quantum activity of superposition and entanglement, the state in which particles begin to interact \u2013 again rather mysteriously \u2013 co-dependently, and the qubits are linked by quantum mechanics regardless of their position in space. Any intrusion of heat or light would corrupt the process and thus the effectiveness of the computer. Exactly how and why quantum physics adheres to these science-fiction like rules remains an issue of great speculation, but perhaps the most common theory is that the different quantum states exist in separate universes. The D-Wave quantum computer I look at has one thousand qubits. \u201cA thousand qubit computer can be in 2 to the 1,000 states at one time, which is 10 to the 300th power,\u201d says D-Wave\u2019s CEO, Vern Brownell. \u201cThere\u2019s only 10 to the 80th atoms in the universe. Now does this mean it\u2019s in 10 to the 300th universes at the same time?\u201d Can billions of different universes coexist within one computer? That\u2019s the sort of question that is probably best not grappled with before midnight and without the aid of illegal stimulants. And in a sense, the answer doesn\u2019t matter. The more immediate and relevant question is whether or not this quantum computer works. At the moment quantum computing still resides within a largely theoretical or speculative realm. The potential is staggering, involving a computational power many times the order of all the world\u2019s existing classical computers combined. But realising that potential is a fiendishly difficult task. That\u2019s why D-Wave\u2019s 2X computer costs more than $15m and only a handful of organisations have so far bought one. Still, as those organisations include Google, Lockheed Martin and Nasa, and among D-Wave\u2019s investors are Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos and the CIA\u2019s hi-tech arm, In-Q-Tel, it\u2019s clear that some of the world\u2019s most forward- looking institutions believe that the computer has a future. In areas such as artificial intelligence and cryptography, it\u2019s thought that quantum computing will transform the landscape, perhaps bringing about the breakthrough that will enable machines to \u201cthink\u201d with the nuance and interpretative skill of humans. Brownell used to be chief of technology at Goldman Sachs. In that job there were few tech developments that he didn\u2019t have pitched at him. He believes that while social media successes like Facebook are clever utilisations of existing technology, the fact that Silicon Valley is constantly chasing profitable variations on the same theme means that it is no longer doing the really tough mental work. \u201cThe level of innovation is much, much less than we\u2019ve seen historically and probably at an all-time low in terms of the real world-changing innovations.\u201d D-Wave, he says, boldly bucks this trend. But that\u2019s not how he used to think. When he first heard about D-Wave seven years ago, the company had been going for nine years and, in some informed circles, was a bit of a laughing stock. His initial reaction when the company approached him was deep scepticism. \u201cI didn\u2019t believe it at first at all,\u201d he says, \u201cparticularly as there were all these blog comments with experts saying it was snake oil. I wasn\u2019t really interested.\u201d His attitude changed when he came out and met the team. D-Wave was co-founded by Geordie Rose, a 44-year-old physics PhD who, doubtful about academia, took a course in entrepreneurship. He was impatient with the research approach of highly expensive but severely limited laboratory experiments. Rose\u2019s novel idea was to build a functioning quantum computer with commercial appeal. But this is where the science starts to cause people to pull their hair out. Most experimental quantum computers that had been assembled in labs followed the universal gate model, in which qubits substituted for transistors, without any notable success. Rose chose instead to develop an \u201cadiabatic\u201d quantum computer, which works by a process of what\u2019s called \u201cquantum annealing\u201d or \u201ctunnelling\u201d. In essence, it means you develop an algorithm that assigns specific interactions between the qubits along the lines of the classical model \u2013 ie if this is a 0, that one is 1 etc. Then create the conditions for quantum superposition, in which the qubits can realise their near infinite possibilities, before returning them to the classical state of 0s and 1s. The idea is the qubits will follow the path of least energy in relation to the algorithmic requirements, thus finding the most efficient answer. If that\u2019s hard enough to explain, imagine how difficult it was to build. And the early results were not encouraging. No one seemed to be sure what, if anything, was going on at a quantum level, but whatever it was, it wasn\u2019t impressive. D-Wave\u2019s first demonstration in 2007 of its 16-qubit device, which involved solving a sudoku puzzle, hardly set the world on fire. Umesh Vazirani, co-author of a paper on quantum complexity theory, dismissed D-Wave\u2019s claims of speedup as a misunderstanding of his work, and suggested that \u201ceven if it turns out to be a true quantum computer, and even if it could be scaled to thousands of qubits, [it] would likely not be more powerful than a cellphone\u201d. Thereafter the company was regularly accused of hype and exaggeration. Part of the problem was that it was very hard to measure with any agreed accuracy what was happening. D-Wave came up with a test to show that entanglement \u2013 seen as a necessary prerequisite for a working quantum computer \u2013 was taking place. But some experts doubted the reliability of the test. When D-Wave passed a different test, developed by an independent scientist, sceptics argued that while entanglement might be happening, the only real test was performance. In 2013, the D-Wave Two was cited in one test as performing 3,600 times faster than a classical computer. But yet again these results were rubbished by several prominent scientists in the field. In 2014 Matthias Troyer, a renowned professor of computational physics, published a report that stated that he found \u201cno evidence of quantum speedup\u201d. A longtime doubter of D-Wave\u2019s claims is Scott Aaronson, a professor at MIT, who has called himself \u201cChief D-Wave Sceptic\u201d. After Troyer\u2019s paper, he argued that although quantum effects were probably taking place in D-Wave\u2019s devices, there was no reason to believe they played a causal role or that they were faster than a classical computer. Brownell is dismissive of these critics, claiming that the \u201cquestion has been largely settled\u201d. He cites Google\u2019s comparative test last year in which its D-Wave quantum computer solved certain problems 100m times faster than a classical computer. \u201cIf it isn\u2019t quantum computing,\u201d asks Brownell, \u201cthen how did we build something that\u2019s a hundred million times faster than an Intel Core? It either has to be quantum computing or some other law of nature that we haven\u2019t discovered yet that\u2019s even more exciting than quantum mechanics. I challenge any scientist in the world to tell us: if it\u2019s not quantum annealing, what is it?\u201d Even Aaronson acknowledged that the Google test was significant. \u201cThis is certainly the most impressive demonstration so far of the D-Wave machine\u2019s capabilities. And yet,\u201d he added, \u201cit remains totally unclear whether you can get to what I\u2019d consider \u2018true quantum speedup\u2019 using D-Wave\u2019s architecture.\u201d But Troyer was not convinced. \u201cYou need to read the fine print,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is 108 times faster than some specific classical algorithm on problems designed to be very hard for that algorithm but easy for D-Wave\u2026 A claim of 108 speedup is thus very misleading.\u201d One side-benefit of all these claims and counter-claims, as Aaronson has most forcefully argued, is that they help us to understand quantum mechanics a little better. Nic Harrigan works at the Centre for Quantum Photonics at Bristol University, a leading research institute in quantum mechanics. \u201cAlthough there are incredible potential applications of quantum computing,\u201d Harrigan says, \u201ceven if no one ever builds a useful quantum computer we still learn an immense amount by attempting to. This might sound like ass-covering, but quantum mechanics itself is a theory so fundamental to our understanding of the universe, and is the seed to so many current and future other technologies, that anything we can do to understand it better is huge. Somewhat incredibly it turns out that a good way to try and understand what is actually going on in quantum mechanics (and just how it differs from normal classical physics) is to consider which kind of computational problems one can more easily solve using quantum mechanical systems.\u201d At Google they were cautiously optimistic about D-Wave\u2019s usefulness. The head of engineering, Hartmut Neven, outlined the strengths and weaknesses of the tests, and acknowledged that while there were other algorithms that, if deployed on classical computers, could outperform quantum annealing, he expected future developments to favour quantum annealing. \u201cThe design of next-generation annealers must facilitate the embedding of problems of practical relevance,\u201d he said. The kinds of problems that quantum annealing might help address are all concerned with what\u2019s called optimisation \u2013 finding the most efficient model in complex systems. \u201cOptimisation sounds like a really boring problem,\u201d says Brownell, \u201cbut it\u2019s at the core of so many complex application problems in every discipline. Probably one of the most exciting is in the artificial intelligence world. Say you\u2019re trying to recognise a water bottle. It still takes computers an enormous amount of time to do that not as well as humans do. Computers are catching up, but quantum computing can help accelerate that process.\u201d He cites genomics, economics and medicine as other areas that are rich with optimisation problems. With conventional computers, creating complex models \u2013 such as, for example, the Monte Carlo simulation used in the finance industry to analyse different interest rate scenarios \u2013 requires an enormous amount of computing power. And computing power requires real power. \u201cYou go to these big web properties and they have data centres that are installed next to hydroelectric plants because they consume so much electricity,\u201d says Brownell. \u201cThey\u2019re the second-largest consumers of electrical energy on the planet.\u201d D-Wave\u2019s vision, he says, is for a green revolution in computing, in which everyone will have access to much more energy-efficient quantum computers through the cloud. In a few years, he thinks, we\u2019ll be able to access quantum computing from our phones. \u201cI think we have the opportunity to create one of the most valuable technology companies in history,\u201d says Brownell. \u201cI know that sounds really grand, but based on the capability we\u2019ve built, we\u2019re at the stage to be the dominant player in quantum computing for decades to come.\u201d Well, any self-respecting CEO would say that. But it certainly seems that D-Wave are currently leading the quantum computer race. Where that race is going, what it involves and how many universes it\u2019s taking place in are, however, questions that we\u2019ll probably need a working quantum computer to answer.",

          "bodyText": "Canada\u2019s prime minister, the Liberal Justin Trudeau, had what we might call an interesting moment in the House of Commons in Ottawa last week. Trudeau, impatient to get a vote started (on assisted death legislation), strode over to a scrum of stalling politicians, pulling chief opposition whip Gordon Brown towards his chair, allegedly shouting at others: \u201cGet the fuck out of the way\u201d, and sharply elbowed New Democratic party MP Ruth Ellen Brosseau in the chest. Brosseau was clearly shocked by the incident and left before the vote, with Trudeau later apologising for \u201cimpacting\u201d her. \u201cImpacting\u201d is one way of putting it, though it\u2019s clear from the footage that what happened to Brosseau was unintentional.

The Vote Leave claims have been roundly dismissed by Remain, not least because Gove\u2019s Vote Leave colleague <strong>Boris Johnson </strong>recently said that Turkish accession would not happen in the foreseeable future. But the video shows that the split within the cabinet and the Conservative party over the EU is becoming deeper, more bitter and more personal, because some of Cameron\u2019s cabinet colleagues are now effectively questioning his honesty. Number 10 has not responded to the attack video, but <strong>Philip Hammond</strong>, the foreign secretary, has dismissed the NHS/Turkey claims. He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>These figures are very often just plucked from thin air and they are not designed to inform, they are designed to confuse.

The gap probably narrows when one takes account of the greater determination of \u201cleave\u201d supporters to turn out to vote, to around: remain 53-55%, leave 45-47%.</p> <p>However, past referendums in Britain and abroad have generally produced a late shift to the status quo, as people who make up their minds late tend to prefer the familiarity of the status quo to the risks of change. Given the character of the debate about the economic impact of Brexit, a similar shift looks likely this time.</p> <p>This could lead to a significant majority in favour of the UK staying in the EU. From David Cameron\u2019s point of view, this is just as well. A narrow 51-49% victory would be unlikely to settle the matter for long, or bring the two sides within the Conservative Party together. He probably needs a percentage majority in double digits \u2013 10% or more \u2013 to have any chance of marginalising his anti-EU critics inside his party. The good news for the Prime Minister from this analysis is that he is currently on course to achieve it. The bad news is that it could still go wrong for him, especially if some kind of crisis erupts in the next five weeks.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"http://whatukthinks.org/eu/time-for-a-cool-head-and-an-open-mind/\">John Curtice at What UK Thinks looks at this week\u2019s polls and concludes there is no clear evidence of a shift to Remain.</a></strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For now what we do have to conclude is that collectively the latest round of polling does not provide clear evidence that a swing to Remain is in motion. The lesson of this week is that, as polling day begins to approach, it will become increasingly important to read the polls with a cool head and an open mind.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://lordashcroftpolls.com/2016/05/scaremongering-hitler-boris-again-and-the-view-from-scotland-referendum-focus-groups-with-34-days-to-go/\">Lord Ashcroft writes up his findings from his latest EU referendum focus groups.</a></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Now for what is becoming a regular feature of the focus group tour: why has Boris has been in hot water this week? Some of the participants knew Hitler had come into it somewhere, though some were not sure how (\u201che didn\u2019t do one of those salutes, did he?\u201d) and a few who had heard what he had said thought it had been in poor taste: \u201cHe\u2019s talking about people who wanted to rule the world and send people to gas chambers.\u201d But not for the first time, after hearing what he said in his<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/14/boris-johnson-interview-we-can-be-the-heroes-of-europe-by-voting/\"><em>Telegraph </em>interview</a>, most thought the fuss was out of all proportion to his remarks (\u201cbampot\u201d though he may be). The argument that the EU was trying to unite Europe by other means where various figures in history had failed to do so by force was quite a persuasive point for some (\u201cit would make me think again\u201d; \u201cHitler wanted to rule Europe and so does Angela Merkel and Luxembourg\u201d) and certainly a valid one to make: \u201cHe was alluding to the fact that people have tried to amalgamate Europe many times, and this is another version of it.\u201d As for the row, \u201cseriously, Hitler was someone in history and we shouldn\u2019t pussyfoot about it.\u201d</p> <p>Had he made the same point without using the H-word the rumpus would have been avoided, but most did not think this was a misjudgement on Boris\u2019s part \u2013 quite the opposite: \u201cI think he knew what he was doing.\u201d In their view, the same applied to David Cameron\u2019s speech last week. If what he actually said about security led the papers to exaggerate and talk about war, that was just fine: \u201cThey\u2019d rather get the front page.

If voters thought the 2015 general election was about who was most in touch with the concerns of ordinary voters, Ed Miliband would have become prime minister. But instead they decided it was about who could be trusted most on the economy, and who would make the best prime minister, and in that contest David Cameron won. And that is why the \u2018what factors will affect your EU referendum vote?\u2019 chart (see <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/may/20/eu-referendum-economy-increasingly-important-in-decision-poll-suggests-politics-live?page=with:block-573ed23fe4b0451a6f482b84#block-573ed23fe4b0451a6f482b84\">10.03am)</a> is so important.<br></p> <p>ComRes asked about eight factors. Four of them are factors where Remain is almost certainly winning. Three are factors where Leave clearly has the advantage. And one is probably neutral.</p> <p>All four of the Remain issues have become more important in the views of voters since February, with the economy - by far the most important one - massively more important. It is now cited as important by 55% of respondents, up 17 points from February</p> <p>But two of the three Leave issues have become less important.</p> <p>Here are the key figures.</p> <p><em>Remain issues</em></p> <p>The economy - Up 17 points from February</p> <p>Ability of citizens to live and work in EU - Up 4 points</p> <p>British influence on world stage - Up 2 points</p> <p>Uncertainty created by Brexit - Up 6 points</p> <p><em>Leave issues</em></p> <p>Control over EU migrants coming to UK - Down 2 points</p> <p>Control over British laws - Up 4 points</p> <p>Benefits for EU migrants - Down 8 points</p> <p><em>Either way issues</em></p> <p>National security - Up 4 points</p> <p><strong>2 - David Cameron\u2019s EU renegotiation may have been more useful to the Remain camp than people think. </strong>The renegotiation itself did not produce any real benefit for Remain in the polls and Cameron hardly ever mentions it now, with the result that it was become common to hear people argue that it was a waste of time. But in fact the figures quoted above suggest it had quite a big impact in driving down concern about EU migrants claiming benefits as a referendum issue.</p> <p><strong>3 - And Cameron\u2019s \u2018Brexit could lead to war\u2019 warning may not have failed quite as badly as the poll headlines suggest.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3599354/David-Cameron-s-doom-laden-warning-Brexit-causing-war-Europe-rejected-NINE-10-voters-new-polling-reveals.html\">The Daily Mail says \u201cthe public have emphatically dismissed the prime minister\u2019s argument that, if the UK quits the EU, the continent will be at greater risk of war and genocide\u201d</a> because the poll suggests nine out of 10 people disagree. But the ComRes question asked people if they thought \u201ca major war\u201d in Europe would be more likely if the UK left the EU. Cameron was talking about the increased risk of conflicts like those in Ukraine or the Balkans which don\u2019t really fit the description \u201cmajor war\u201d. And 11% of people do think Brexit would make \u201cmajor war\u201d more likely.</p> <p><strong>4 - Immigrations remains by far the best issue for Leave. </strong>Even though there has been a huge increase in the number of people citing the economy as a key referendum issue (up to 55%), it is still only just ahead of immigration (51%). And the poll shows people are very concerned about the government estimate that 3m people could come to the UK from the EU over the next 14 years. This is from the ComRes press release.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> Leave voters overwhelmingly (87%) think that the 3m people coming to UK used in the Treasury estimates is \u201ctoo high\u201d, while Remain voters are split: 42% say it is too high while half (49%) say it is about right.</p> <p>Remain voters are however twice as likely to think this level of immigration would increase pressure on the NHS and public services (51%) than think it would help to better fund and staff the NHS and other public services (26%).</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>5 - Women are significantly more pro-Remain then men. </strong>This is from the ComRes release.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A definitive trend has emerged that women are significantly more likely than men to say they would vote to Remain in the EU. At 15 points, the Remain lead amongst women is twice as large as it is among men (seven points \u2013 51% to 44%).</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-05-20T11:41:49.181Z\">at 12.41pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-573ed5e1e4b0451a6f482b8f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-20T09:25:36.253Z\">10.25am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Andy Burnham\u2019s bid to become Labour\u2019s candidate for mayor of Greater Manchester suffered a setback this morning. <strong>Terry Christian</strong>, the Mancunian broadcaster, told the Today programme that he thought Burnham was now like \u201ca tourist in the north\u201d.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I do feel a bit sorry for [Burnham] because it\u2019s almost like he\u2019s a tourist in the North nowadays, the way he talks about the north. He said nobody in the North would say they wanted to be a lawyer or a doctor. It\u2019s a bit like he wants to be King of the North now, without getting all Game of Thrones on you. He doesn\u2019t want to be warming the bench for Jeremy Corbyn any more so he wants to come up here. I just think it\u2019s a bit cynical.</p> </blockquote> <p>Christian also rejected the suggestion that he was opposed to Burnham\u2019s bid because Burnham was from Liverpool.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s nothing to do with him coming from Merseyside. It\u2019s just this idea that if you lack the charisma to win the Labour party leadership from someone like Jeremy Corbyn, then we are in trouble.

          "bodyText": "Vote Leave has put David Cameron\u2019s integrity at the heart of the EU referendum campaign, saying he cannot be trusted to keep his word on Turkey. It did so in an attack video released shortly after Michael Gove, the justice secretary and Vote Leave campaign committee co-convenor, gave a briefing to publicise clams that staying in the EU would lead to the NHS being overwhelmed by migrants from Turkey and other countries set to join. The Vote Leave claims have been roundly dismissed by Remain, not least because Gove\u2019s Vote Leave colleague Boris Johnson recently said that Turkish accession would not happen in the foreseeable future. But the video shows that the split within the cabinet and the Conservative party over the EU is becoming deeper, more bitter and more personal, because some of Cameron\u2019s cabinet colleagues are now effectively questioning his honesty. Number 10 has not responded to the attack video, but Philip Hammond, the foreign secretary, has dismissed the NHS/Turkey claims. He said: These figures are very often just plucked from thin air and they are not designed to inform, they are designed to confuse. We\u2019ve made absolutely clear that we won\u2019t contemplate further member states joining the EU until their economies have developed to such a level that they are at least at the European Union average. Gove and Vote Leave have also been accused of aping Ukip and resorting to xenophobic scaremongering, even though until recently they were distancing themselves from the immigration-focused Leave strategy that Nigel Farage has long been championing. Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European commission, has said the British will not get friendly treatment from the EU if they leave because they will be seen as \u201cdeserters\u201d. See 1.48pm. (All this world war two/Hitler talk from our EU referendum campaign must be catching.) Nigel Farage has said the Conservatives could lose a third of their members to Ukip if Britain votes to stay in the EU As Decca Aitkenhead and Rowena Mason report, the Ukip leader said a narrow vote to stay in the EU would be a \u201cdoomsday scenario\u201d for the party, as there would be a backlash against David Cameron for using the government to fight to remain. In an interview with the Guardian, Farage said that Tories campaigning to leave the EU under the official Vote Leave banner were frightened to let Ukip have too big a role in the referendum, fearing what could happen afterwards. The NHS in England has run up a record deficit of \u00a32.45bn \u2013 the biggest overspend in its history \u2013 as it struggles to cope with a surge in demand for care while suffering a major budget squeeze, official figures have revealed. Donald Trump has said he has been invited to visit London by David Cameron. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. Thanks for the comments. Have a good weekend. Here is a short EU referendum reading list. Peter Kellner, the former YouGov president, analyses the current EU referendum polling for his Politics Counter blog and says he thinks Remain are on course to win by about 10 points. I reckon that the current state of opinion among those who express a view is something like: remain 55-57%, leave 43-45%. The gap probably narrows when one takes account of the greater determination of \u201cleave\u201d supporters to turn out to vote, to around: remain 53-55%, leave 45-47%. However, past referendums in Britain and abroad have generally produced a late shift to the status quo, as people who make up their minds late tend to prefer the familiarity of the status quo to the risks of change. Given the character of the debate about the economic impact of Brexit, a similar shift looks likely this time. This could lead to a significant majority in favour of the UK staying in the EU. From David Cameron\u2019s point of view, this is just as well. A narrow 51-49% victory would be unlikely to settle the matter for long, or bring the two sides within the Conservative Party together. He probably needs a percentage majority in double digits \u2013 10% or more \u2013 to have any chance of marginalising his anti-EU critics inside his party. The good news for the Prime Minister from this analysis is that he is currently on course to achieve it. The bad news is that it could still go wrong for him, especially if some kind of crisis erupts in the next five weeks. John Curtice at What UK Thinks looks at this week\u2019s polls and concludes there is no clear evidence of a shift to Remain. For now what we do have to conclude is that collectively the latest round of polling does not provide clear evidence that a swing to Remain is in motion. The lesson of this week is that, as polling day begins to approach, it will become increasingly important to read the polls with a cool head and an open mind. Lord Ashcroft writes up his findings from his latest EU referendum focus groups. Now for what is becoming a regular feature of the focus group tour: why has Boris has been in hot water this week? Some of the participants knew Hitler had come into it somewhere, though some were not sure how (\u201che didn\u2019t do one of those salutes, did he?\u201d) and a few who had heard what he had said thought it had been in poor taste: \u201cHe\u2019s talking about people who wanted to rule the world and send people to gas chambers.\u201d But not for the first time, after hearing what he said in hisTelegraph interview, most thought the fuss was out of all proportion to his remarks (\u201cbampot\u201d though he may be). The argument that the EU was trying to unite Europe by other means where various figures in history had failed to do so by force was quite a persuasive point for some (\u201cit would make me think again\u201d; \u201cHitler wanted to rule Europe and so does Angela Merkel and Luxembourg\u201d) and certainly a valid one to make: \u201cHe was alluding to the fact that people have tried to amalgamate Europe many times, and this is another version of it.\u201d As for the row, \u201cseriously, Hitler was someone in history and we shouldn\u2019t pussyfoot about it.\u201d Had he made the same point without using the H-word the rumpus would have been avoided, but most did not think this was a misjudgement on Boris\u2019s part \u2013 quite the opposite: \u201cI think he knew what he was doing.\u201d In their view, the same applied to David Cameron\u2019s speech last week. If what he actually said about security led the papers to exaggerate and talk about war, that was just fine: \u201cThey\u2019d rather get the front page. They were both happy.\u201d Yvette Cooper, the Labour former shadow home secretary, says Michael Gove\u2019s comments today make him sound like a Ukip politician. Meral Hussein-Ece, the Lib Dem equalities spokesperson, has condemned the Vote Leave Turkey video. This is more desperation from Brexit and Project Fear. This is a xenophobic attack from a leave campaign that knows it is losing the debate. Stigmatising Turkey and the people who live there is a dangerous move which comes from the propaganda playbooks of 100 years ago. One of the great things about the EU is that it encourages us to work together; instead the leave campaign are offering a world of division and distrust. This is not a future we should be fighting for. The Vote Leave claims about how remaining in the EU could lead to the NHS being overwhelmed by migration from countries like Turkey are set out in this 35-page report (pdf). Here is the key table. But Chris Cook, Newsnight\u2019s policy editor, has been looking at Vote Leave figures and thinks they are flawed. He explains why on Twitter. Here are three commentators from the left on Michael Gove\u2019s intervention today. (See 1.25pm.) From Peter Preston, the former Guardian editor From the Financial Times\u2019 Stefan Stern From the Guardian\u2019s Rafael Behr Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, has also accused Jean-Claude Juncker of threatening Britain. Speaking at the launch of the Ukip EU referendum battlebus he said: I think Project Fear will now move on to Project Threat. It sounds to me like Mr Juncker is playing that game. What else do you expect? His whole life has been dedicated to building up these false, undemocratic structures in Brussels. I don\u2019t dislike him personally, but politically I think he is somewhat out of date. This is the same line that Vote Leave is using (see 3.50pm), but that is not because Farage and Vote Leave are particularly close. Farage also dismissed the intervention from more than 250 arts celebrities arguing in favour of remain, saying they were \u201cluvvies\u201d with expensive houses. Gisela Stuart, the Labour MP and chair of Vote Leave, has claimed that Jean-Claude Juncker\u2019s comments about the UK being treated as a \u201cdeserter\u201d by the EU if it leaves (see 1.48pm) show he is \u201ctrying to intimidate the British people\u201d. She said: Another day, another threat from those trying to intimidate the British people into voting to remain in the failing EU - but these extraordinary comments are a new low. The referendum offers a once in a lifetime opportunity for the British people to have a say over our future relationship with the European Union. They want facts, and reasoned arguments, to inform their decision - and this kind of intimidation is unwelcome and unwarranted. And here is the Labour MP Chuka Umunna, a Britain Stronger in Europe spokesman, responding to the Vote Leave claims about Turkey. The opportunistic hypocrisy of the leave campaign has reached new depths. Boris Johnson\u2019s own comments expose their central claims as being a lie. Vote Leave know there will be no new EU countries in the foreseeable future but are lying because they have lost the economic argument. The truth is, you do not control immigration by damaging the economy and sending Britain back to recession, which experts say would happen if we vote to leave. Here is the Conservative MEP and Brexit campaigner Daniel Hannan responding to Jean-Claude Juncker\u2019s comments. Here is a senior Remain source on the new Vote Leave video. Michael Gove may be mouthing the worlds but Nigel Farage is writing the tune. They originally had lofty ambitions of talking about the economy but, since they have lost that argument so catastrophically, they have reached for the Ukip playbook to create fictitious stories to scare people about immigrants and release video nasties about Turkish people. It is a good job Vote Leave did not get Boris Johnson to give the briefing about its figures suggesting the NHS could be overwhelmed by the impact of Turkey, and other countries, joining the EU in the next few years. As Lucy Thomas, Britain Stronger in Europe\u2019s deputy director points out on Twitter, only recently Johnson told LBC that Turkish accession was not going to happen. Johnson said the chances of Turkey joining the EU were \u201cbetween nil and 20%\u201d. When pressed, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen in the foreseeable future\u201d. And, even if it did happen, Turkey would not get the right to free movement of labour within the rest of the EU, he said. Vote Leave has released a new video backing up the claim, also made by Michael Gove in his briefing earlier, that Turkey is going to join the EU. But there are two things about the video that make it particularly provocative, and liable to take the ongoing Conservative party civil war over Europe at least one notch higher up the DefCon scale. First, this is not really about Turkey at all, but about David Cameron. And, second, Vote Leave are not just making a point about policy. They are attacking Cameron\u2019s integrity. This is routine in elections, of course, but the Vote Leave campaign is headed by Tories like Michael Gove and Boris Johnson and they are now effectively saying that their party leader is not a man who can be relied upon to do what he says. Here is a quote from the voiceover. David Cameron cannot be trusted on Turkey ... David Cameron now claims Turkey won\u2019t join the EU, but that is not what he said before ... We are giving \u00a32bn to Macedonia, Serbia, Albania, Montenegro and Turkey to join the EU. You can\u2019t trust David Cameron on Turkey. If you want to save the NHS, vote Leave. Let\u2019s take back control. The video is also illustrated with pictures of deputies fighting in the Turkish parliament which seem intended to reinforce particularly negative stereotypes of that country. The head of an NHS trust told the World at One that the NHS should consider the case for charging patients in the light of the problems funding the service highlighted by today\u2019s deficit figures. (See 1.34pm.) Susan Acott, chief executive of Dartford and Gravesham NHS Trust, told the programme: I think it\u2019s something that modern countries need to consider and because we have our cherished NHS I don\u2019t think that should prevent sensible and intelligent discussions around whether free at the point of use is always the right thing to do. If you look at examples like dentistry and ophthalmology we often contribute, so I certainly think it\u2019s a question that needs to be asked. Here is the full text of the Le Monde interview with Jean-Claude Juncker. As well as the remarks quoted earlier (see 1.48pm), the European commission president said that, if Britain votes to remain in the EU, they would have to implement the proposals agreed during David Cameron\u2019s renegotiation. But Juncker also included a line about how no-one was actually talking about it during the campaign (\u201cdont personne ne parle dans la campagne du r\u00e9f\u00e9rendum\u201d). It sounds a little as if he is complaining that it was all a bit of a waste of time. (Juncker obviously hasn\u2019t read my analysis of the ComRes poll, which argues that the renegotiation may have been more helpful to Cameron than people realise.) Vote Leave\u2019s claims about migration from the EU overwhelming the NHS are based on the assumption that five new countries, including Turkey, would join the EU within the next four years. The BBC\u2019s Reality Check says that is unlikely. Earlier this month David Cameron said he did not think Turkey would join the EU \u201cfor decades\u201d. Lord Kinnock, the former Labour leader and a leading Remain campaigner, has rejected Michael Gove\u2019s claims about EU immigration overwhelming the NHS. (See 1.25pm.) As the BBC reports he said: Analysis by the Treasury shows that leaving the EU\u2019s single market of 500m people would devastate our economy, leaving a \u00a336bn black hole in the public finances. This would leave less money available for our health service. Michael Gove\u2019s hypocrisy is staggering. Just a year ago, he admitted that our NHS relies on over 100,000 workers from the EU, and supported the living wage that benefits low-paid British workers. Now he\u2019s turned his back on both. Patients, doctors and nurses are stronger thanks to our membership of the EU. Leaving would be a leap in the dark that would put our NHS at risk. Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, has said that the UK will not get friendly treatment from the EU if it votes to leave. In an interview with the French newspaper Le Monde, asked how Brussels would respond to a Leave vote, Juncker said: Deserters will not be welcomed with open arms. If the British say no - which I hope they will not - community life will not carry on as before. The United Kingdom will have to accept being considered as a third party, which does not have its hair stroked in the right direction. Juncker\u2019s \u201chair stroked in the right direction\u201d metaphor is an unusual one. Perhaps he had someone in mind ... UPDATE: A reader tells me that \u201ccaresser pas dans le sens du poil\u201d is actually a common French expression. And here is Denis Campbell\u2019s story on the NHS trust deficit figures. And here is how it starts. The NHS in England has run up a record deficit of \u00a32.45bn \u2013 the biggest overspend in its history \u2013 as it struggles to cope with a surge in demand for care while suffering a major budget squeeze. Official figures released on Friday by NHS Improvement showed that NHS trusts in England, which predominantly run hospitals, ended the 2015-16 financial year \u00a3461m worse than the organisation had forecast. The combined deficit is almost three times bigger than the \u00a3822m overspend incurred the year before, and more than 20 times the size of the \u00a3115m deficit as recently as 2013-14. Here is my colleague Rowena Mason\u2019s story about Michael Gove\u2019s briefing. And here is how it starts. Michael Gove has claimed that the NHS will no longer be sustainable if Britain stays in the EU because an immigrant population the size of Scotland could come to the UK by 2030. The justice secretary and leading Brexit campaigner said if the UK votes to remainin the EU on 23 June he would press the government for an emergency cash injection for the NHS, while if it voted to leave he would push for hundreds of millions of pounds currently sent to the EU to be spent on the health service. Gove\u2019s speech coincided with official figures showing the NHS in England has run up a record deficit of \u00a32.45bn \u2013 the biggest overspend in its history \u2013 as it struggles to cope with a surge in demand for care while suffering a major budget squeeze. The Vote Leave immigration forecasts are likely to be strongly challenged by the remain campaign as they presume that five new countries will join the EU within four years. David Cameron has said Turkey is unlikely to join the EU in his lifetime. EU referendum polling has shown a marked contrast between the findings of online polls and phone polls. The Guardian\u2019s pollster, ICM, uses both methods and its most recent figures had the phone poll giving Remain a 10-point lead, but the online survey putting Remain ahead by just four points. Some commentators think phone polls will turn out to be more accurate. But YouGov (an online pollster) has published some research which it says suggests online polling is more accurate. The YouGov article, by its chief innovation officer Andy Morris, argues that the phone polls are giving too much representation to the well educated. Here\u2019s an extract. There are some major demographic correlators with how people intend to vote, for example age, social grade, and geography, all play extremely important roles but there is no driver more important than education. The longer time spent in education, the more likely you are to vote \u2018remain\u2019 ... With phone polls under-representing the less well educated so dramatically it is not surprising that they are skewing towards \u2018remain\u2019. The online polls are doing a better job of finding representative samples and therefore a better job of representing the views of the population. Ryanair is running an advertising campaign offering people cheap flights to the UK from Europe on the day of the EU referendum, or the day before, so that people can \u201cfly home to vote Remain\u201d. But Vote Leave has reported them to the police, claiming this is a breach of the law relating to election bribes. My colleague John Plunkett has the details. If you want more details of the letter signed by more than 250 leading creative figures - 282, to be precise - there are here, on the Britain Stronger in Europe website. The full list of names is on the website, but here are some of the most prominent ones, as selected by Britain Stronger in Europe.

The Green party has announced details of how its leadership contest will be run following Natalie Bennett\u2019s announcement that she is standing down. Nominations will open on 1 June and close on 30 June. The campaign period will run from 1 July to 24 July, and that will be followed by a one-month balloting period. The new leader will be unveiled at the party conference in early September. Normally David Cameron would be accompanied on a visit to somewhere like Abbey Road by his own culture secretary, not someone who used to do the job for Tony Blair. (See 11.28am.) But John Whittingdale, the current culture secretary, is a Brexiteer. According to Guido Fawkes, he has been sent to China on government business - meaning that he is not available to hit the airwaves to argue back against the 250-plus culture celebrities saying the UK should stay in the EU. Back to Abbey Road, and David Cameron has been doing his bit to try to recreate the image on the Beatles\u2019 Abbey Road album. But the Mirror has concluded that he \u201cmonumentally screwed it up\u201d because it was just he and Tessa Jowell, the Labour former culture secretary, posing for the picture, not a fab four. Speaking about his visit, Cameron said: When it comes to creativity, British talent and expertise has made this country the envy of the world. Whether it is music or film, art or video games, the UK leads Europe. More than most, this is a sector that thrives on being open to the world outside. Whether it\u2019s bringing in talent, filming on location or simply having access to the single market of 500 million people across Europe. The results of Creative Industries Federation\u2019s survey are clear: we are better off in a reformed European Union than out on our own. To leave would be a leap in the dark. Here is more on the ComRes EU referendum poll - five things we\u2019ve learnt. 1 - If the poll is right, Remain are winning the battle to frame the EU referendum debate. In an election, framing the terms of the debate is crucial. If voters thought the 2015 general election was about who was most in touch with the concerns of ordinary voters, Ed Miliband would have become prime minister. But instead they decided it was about who could be trusted most on the economy, and who would make the best prime minister, and in that contest David Cameron won. And that is why the \u2018what factors will affect your EU referendum vote?\u2019 chart (see 10.03am) is so important. ComRes asked about eight factors. Four of them are factors where Remain is almost certainly winning. Three are factors where Leave clearly has the advantage. And one is probably neutral. All four of the Remain issues have become more important in the views of voters since February, with the economy - by far the most important one - massively more important. It is now cited as important by 55% of respondents, up 17 points from February But two of the three Leave issues have become less important. Here are the key figures. Remain issues The economy - Up 17 points from February Ability of citizens to live and work in EU - Up 4 points British influence on world stage - Up 2 points Uncertainty created by Brexit - Up 6 points Leave issues Control over EU migrants coming to UK - Down 2 points Control over British laws - Up 4 points Benefits for EU migrants - Down 8 points Either way issues National security - Up 4 points 2 - David Cameron\u2019s EU renegotiation may have been more useful to the Remain camp than people think. The renegotiation itself did not produce any real benefit for Remain in the polls and Cameron hardly ever mentions it now, with the result that it was become common to hear people argue that it was a waste of time. But in fact the figures quoted above suggest it had quite a big impact in driving down concern about EU migrants claiming benefits as a referendum issue. 3 - And Cameron\u2019s \u2018Brexit could lead to war\u2019 warning may not have failed quite as badly as the poll headlines suggest. The Daily Mail says \u201cthe public have emphatically dismissed the prime minister\u2019s argument that, if the UK quits the EU, the continent will be at greater risk of war and genocide\u201d because the poll suggests nine out of 10 people disagree. But the ComRes question asked people if they thought \u201ca major war\u201d in Europe would be more likely if the UK left the EU. Cameron was talking about the increased risk of conflicts like those in Ukraine or the Balkans which don\u2019t really fit the description \u201cmajor war\u201d. And 11% of people do think Brexit would make \u201cmajor war\u201d more likely. 4 - Immigrations remains by far the best issue for Leave. Even though there has been a huge increase in the number of people citing the economy as a key referendum issue (up to 55%), it is still only just ahead of immigration (51%). And the poll shows people are very concerned about the government estimate that 3m people could come to the UK from the EU over the next 14 years. This is from the ComRes press release. Leave voters overwhelmingly (87%) think that the 3m people coming to UK used in the Treasury estimates is \u201ctoo high\u201d, while Remain voters are split: 42% say it is too high while half (49%) say it is about right. Remain voters are however twice as likely to think this level of immigration would increase pressure on the NHS and public services (51%) than think it would help to better fund and staff the NHS and other public services (26%). 5 - Women are significantly more pro-Remain then men. This is from the ComRes release. A definitive trend has emerged that women are significantly more likely than men to say they would vote to Remain in the EU. At 15 points, the Remain lead amongst women is twice as large as it is among men (seven points \u2013 51% to 44%). Andy Burnham\u2019s bid to become Labour\u2019s candidate for mayor of Greater Manchester suffered a setback this morning. Terry Christian, the Mancunian broadcaster, told the Today programme that he thought Burnham was now like \u201ca tourist in the north\u201d. I do feel a bit sorry for [Burnham] because it\u2019s almost like he\u2019s a tourist in the North nowadays, the way he talks about the north. He said nobody in the North would say they wanted to be a lawyer or a doctor. It\u2019s a bit like he wants to be King of the North now, without getting all Game of Thrones on you. He doesn\u2019t want to be warming the bench for Jeremy Corbyn any more so he wants to come up here. I just think it\u2019s a bit cynical. Christian also rejected the suggestion that he was opposed to Burnham\u2019s bid because Burnham was from Liverpool. It\u2019s nothing to do with him coming from Merseyside. It\u2019s just this idea that if you lack the charisma to win the Labour party leadership from someone like Jeremy Corbyn, then we are in trouble. Manchester deserves someone with a bit more oomph about them. But Christian did say Burnham was \u201ca lovely bloke\u201d. It is worth pointing out that Burnham did not actually say nobody in the north would say they wanted to be a lawyer or a doctor. Our story about what he did say is here. Here are the key figures from the ComRes poll. These are the replies when people were asked: \u201cThinking about the referendum on Britain\u2019s membership of the EU, which three of the following will be the most important to you in deciding which way to vote?\u201d In case you cannot read under the blue shading, the figures in the first column are the figures for February 2016. The figures in the column on the far right are from the poll released late last night. Here is the ComRes news release about its poll. It was a phone poll, not an internet one. And here are the tables (pdf). Here is a Guardian video of the Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau explaining why he thinks the UK should stay in the EU. Good morning. It\u2019s Friday, but there is no rest for the wicked, or those involved in the EU referendum campaign - categories that may or may not overlap, according to your views. Here are the latest EU referendum developments. Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, has joined those world leaders saying the UK should stay in the EU. He told Reuters: More unity is a path toward greater prosperity. We have a great relationship with a strong and united Europe and certainly hope that that continues. Britain is always going to have clout, it\u2019s just obviously amplified by its strength as part of the EU. I believe we\u2019re always better when we work as closely as possible together and separatism, or division, doesn\u2019t seem to be a productive path for countries. He also played down the suggestion that the UK would be able to negotiate a Canada-style free trade deal with the EU anytime soon. He said Canada had spend 10 years negotiating its deal, and it still had to come into force. There\u2019s nothing easy or automatic about [negotiating a trade deal]. So I think there\u2019s a bit of an oversimplification of the story happening there. David Cameron has been visiting Abbey Road Studios to highlight the fact that more than 250 of Britain\u2019s best-known musicians, actors, artists, and writers have signed a joint letter saying Britain should stay in the EU. Here is the Guardian story about the letter. And here are some tweets from the visit. A ComRes poll for the Daily Mail suggests that there has been a sharp increase in people saying the economy will be an important factor in deciding how people will vote in the EU referendum. And poll suggests Remain has a nine-point lead. But the poll also shows that voters do not believe leaving the EU increase the chances of war, as Cameron suggested in a speech last week. This is the poll finding that the Daily Mail has focused on in its story. Here is the agenda for the day. 10.30am: Michael Gove, the justice secretary and co-convenor of the Vote Leave campaign committee, holds a briefing. It is embargoed until 1pm. 12pm: NHS deficit figures are published. 2pm: Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, launches the Ukip EU referendum bus. As usual, I will be covering the breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I will post a summary at lunchtime and another in the afternoon. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but normally I find it impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer direct questions, although sometimes I miss them or don\u2019t have time. Alternatively you could post a question to me on Twitter. If you think there are any voices that I\u2019m leaving out, particularly political figures or organisations giving alternative views of the stories I\u2019m covering, do please flag them up below the line (include \u201cAndrew\u201d in the post). I can\u2019t promise to include everything, but I do try to be open to as wide a range of perspectives as possible.",

Justin Trudeau was elected to be Canada's PM, Sophie Trudeau did not run for any office. It is actually undemocratic to give a political role to the spouse of an elected politician, or indeed any government role, and that lack of legitimacy creates problems. A spouse who sees opportunity to take on high profile roles by virtue of their partner's status will run into difficulties because of that. People can legitimately ask &quot;who voted for you then?&quot; Eva Peron got away with it because everyone knew her husband would never have been voted president without her highly visible campaigning on his behalf, but Hillary Clinton had to scale back her campaigning while first lady and build herself a proper career as a politician.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <h2>\u2018She wasn\u2019t hired by the people of Canada to do good deeds\u2019<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/16/sophie-trudeau-fairy-tale-women-canada#comment-74336329\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/12549209\" title=\"View Mkjaks\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/12549209\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for Mkjaks\"> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/12549209\" title=\"View Mkjaks\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">Mkjaks</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/74336329\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">16 May 2016 11:59am</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>Look, in a certain way, I &quot;did it all&quot; and without two nannies and staff.

It doesn't really have all that much to do with women doing it all, as humans having limited hours in the day. While Harper was in power, his wife had much less involvement in public projects and had more staff, but it is being highlighted by critics of the liberal party to undermine Sophie as a dilettante as another way of suggesting Justin is the playboy PM - a failed election tactic of the Harper government, despite Trudeau taking office and instituting both immediate and sweeping reforms. They are hugely popular in Canada - Trudeau's most recent approvals are currently 61%. It's hardly an unreasonable request - she is far more popular and in demand than her predecessor and as such the volume of work to manage her ability to provide support and time is a larger task that requires a larger staff. If it was private business, a person would simply be hired and she would be congratulated on her success and expansion of herself as a commodity, but as a public figure she is a target for political rhetoric. It's ridiculous she is being criticised for highlighting an organisational need.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <h2>\u2018She gets free daycare, while the rest of Ontario has to pay for it \u2019<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/16/sophie-trudeau-fairy-tale-women-canada#comment-74337550\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/12962511\" title=\"View scoott\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/12962511\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for scoott\"> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/12962511\" title=\"View scoott\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">scoott</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/74337550\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">16 May 2016 12:15pm</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>The double standard is that she gets free daycare for her children, while everyone else in Ontario, the province that she lives in, has to pay for it themselves.

Now they want to feed us the crumbs Chinese dominate US real estate A new study suggests Chinese investors are now the largest foreign buyers of US property. A surge in investment, $110bn over the past five years, helped the real estate market recover from the crash that began in 2006 and precipitated the 2008 economic crisis. But the investment has also pushed real estate prices higher and there\u2019s no sign that cash inflows are slowing \u2013 Chinese investment could double. Chinese pour $110bn into US real estate, says study Woody Allen and Donald Trump take heat at Cannes The Oscar-winning actress Susan Sarandon has launched a new attack on Woody Allen. Sarandon told a discussion celebrating the 25th anniversary of Thelma and Louise that the director, who was investigated but never charged after he allegedly sexually assaulted his daughter, had \u201csexually assaulted a child and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right\u201d. Sarandon, a prominent Bernie Sanders supporter, then went after Donald Trump. \u201cThe thing interesting about Trump is the things he\u2019s talking about are impossible,\u201d she said. Susan Sarandon blasts Woody Allen and Donald Trump at Cannes Hayne Plane takes off for Olympics \u2013 possibly Jarryd Hayne, the Australian rugby league star who played for the San Francisco 49ers last season, has left the NFL in search of a place at the Games in Rio with the Fiji rugby union sevens team. It may not be an easy path: the Fijians (from the land of Hayne\u2019s father) are the best in the world and only have 12 places available; Hayne has one HSBC Sevens World Series event in which to make his case; and the NFL\u2019s stand-off with world anti-doping bodies may throw a spanner in the works. It may be wiser to bet on the Patriots\u2019 Nate Ebner, currently with the USA sevens team. Jarryd Hayne retires from NFL to pursue Olympic rugby sevens dream with Fiji And another thing\u2026 Dean Karnazes\u2019 muscles never tire. He can run for three days and nights without stopping. His secret, apparently, is that he never reaches his lactate threshold \u2013 the burning sensation as your muscles begin to tire. David Cox writes that Karnazes has never experienced any form of muscle burn or cramp, even during runs exceeding 100 miles. That means his only limits are in the mind. Dean Karnazes: the man who can run for ever",

It is to stand idly by while these corporations move on to claim their next victims. To argue, as prime minister Justin Trudeau has, that making the connection between climate change and this infernal fire isn\u2019t \u201chelpful,\u201d is not a gesture of statesmanly maturity. It is the prevarication of political cowards.</p> <p>Other politicians have adopted an even more toxic approach: not letting the crisis go to waste. Former Conservative natural resources minister Joe Oliver <a href=\"http://www.apple.com\">argued</a> on national television that Trudeau should seize the fire as an opportunity to force through a tar sands pipeline to the coast.

In the days ahead, watch for this argument to grow even louder. </p> <p>But the greatest model of insensitivity is this: the arsonists don\u2019t seem content with the burning of just one Canadian town. The latest climate science has told us exactly how much fossil fuels we can <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jan/07/much-worlds-fossil-fuel-reserve-must-stay-buried-prevent-climate-change-study-says\">burn</a> before we lock in catastrophic warming\u2014warming that will make today\u2019s mega-fire look modest.

Investigators will comb the nearby forests for clues, tracing the fire\u2019s path to what they call its \u201cpoint of origin.\u201d They\u2019ll interview witnesses, collect satellite imagery, and rule out natural causes\u2014much like the work of detectives. Except in the age of climate change-fuelled mega-fires, this truly is a crime scene. Not, I mean, the handiwork of troublesome teenagers, nor a campfire left accidentally burning. The devastation of Fort McMurray is the predictable outcome of arson on an entirely different scale. These arsonists have a name and they\u2019re hiding in plain view\u2014because their actions, at the moment, are still considered legal. They\u2019re the companies that helped turn the boreal forest into a flammable tinder-box. The same companies that have undermined attempts to rein in carbon emissions. The same companies that, by their very design, chase profits with no mind for the ecological and human consequences. Yet in the fire\u2019s aftermath, it has seemed impossible to name them: fossil fuel corporations. Of course they\u2019re not the only ones who have fuelled climate change: all of us consume oil at every level of our lives. But the record is clear that we are not equally responsible: an astonishing 90 companies alone have caused two-thirds of global carbon emissions. And all the oil giants involved in the Alberta tar sands are among them: ExxonMobil, BP, Shell, Total, CNRL, Chevron.

Svalbard, the self-governing Norwegian territory whose residents carry guns to defend themselves against polar bears whenever they leave greater downtown Longyearbyen (population about 2,000), and where fresh vegetables are very scarce (as is daylight in winter). On the other hand, if you can support yourself financially, you <a href=\"http://www.sysselmannen.no/Documents/Sysselmannen_dok/Informasjon/Engelsk_KFmF9.pdf\">won\u2019t need a visa or residence permit</a>.</p> <p>But beware of what you wish for. </p> <p>You may leave the United States, but the US won\u2019t let you go so easily. Specifically, you may be residing overseas but the IRS insists that you keep filing tax returns. Nope, it doesn\u2019t matter that you don\u2019t live here any more, don\u2019t have any income or assets here, or don\u2019t even visit any more. All that counts is that you\u2019re still a citizen.</p> <p>The US is one of a tiny handful of countries in the world to tax non-resident citizens on their worldwide income, and the only major industrialized nation to do so. So before you stomp off to live overseas in a huff, you might want to be aware of just what you\u2019re signing up for: a lifetime of living under two tax regimes and (potentially) paying two sets of taxes. For instance, if you own a house in Canada, you won\u2019t get the benefit of mortgage interest deductions (that\u2019s Canadian tax policy at work). Under US law, you may find yourself paying capital gains tax when you sell it, even if Revenue Canada says you don\u2019t owe them a penny.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"37ce3357204d411f1261c0858dd4d77136164ce9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/37ce3357204d411f1261c0858dd4d77136164ce9/0_21_3110_1866/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Born in the US, Boris Johnson hasn\u2019t lived here since the age of five.

One famous (former) member of this group is Boris Johnson, the former mayor of London. Born in the US, Johnson hasn\u2019t lived here since the age of five. He initially simply refused to file US tax returns \u2013 or to pay US taxes on the sale of his London house. And then (after quietly paying the bill) <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/feb/14/london-mayor-boris-johnson-to-renounce-us-citizenship\">he renounced his citizenship. </a></p> <p>Many haven\u2019t lived in the US since their birth or childhood; some may not even have social security numbers. That doesn\u2019t matter. They were born there, and if they haven\u2019t relinquished their citizenship \u2013 a costly and cumbersome process \u2013 they have to keep filing tax returns and being aware that they can\u2019t invest in some kinds of mutual funds that might be standard products in their home countries but might trigger big tax liabilities in the US. </p> <p>While the number of Americans who have relinquished their citizenship, like Johnson, hit a record last year, that number still <a href=\"http://intltax.typepad.com/intltax_blog/number-of-expatriates/\">only just approached 4,300</a>. The reason is the sheer complexity involved, suggests Suzanne Shier, chief wealth planning and tax strategist at Northern Trust. The US doesn\u2019t care that you left because you didn\u2019t like the political regime, \u201cthey look at objective facts, and those facts have a tax consequence. Then the question is whether you are defined as a \u2018covered expat\u2019 who will have to pay an exit tax or not.\u201d </p> <p>Many ordinary Americans aren\u2019t \u201ccovered expats\u201d \u2013 you\u2019d have to be fairly wealthy, outside your retirement accounts and home \u2013 but just the paperwork proving it is daunting, and the costs of doing that paperwork can be intimidating. \u201cAnd there aren\u2019t many people who deal with expatriation,\u201d Shier says. You\u2019d have to be committed to making it happen.</p> <p>Equally, there aren\u2019t many people overseas who will work with expatriates. Try to find an accountant able to fill out a US tax return in Prague or Ottawa; even opening a bank account these days has become incredibly difficult. The Foreign Account Tax Account Compliance Act (Fatca), designed to root out tax evaders, has made it difficult for Accidental Americans to even open a routine bank account in their \u201chome country\u201d.</p> <p>A growing number of Accidental Americans or long-term expatriates are <a href=\"http://www.taxanalysts.com/www/features.nsf/Features/4B25BA71D312B2D285257F1500682E46?OpenDocument\">getting letters from their banks</a> threatening to close their accounts and take away their mortgages if they don\u2019t prove, within 30 days, that they have renounced their US citizenship. It has just become far too costly for those banks to comply with Fatca, and as a result, American expats are becoming, in the words of one advocate for Accidental Americans, \u201cfinancial pariahs\u201d. Some of the recipients of those letters haven\u2019t lived in the US since infancy and have never had a social security number, making it virtually impossible to do that. Some weren\u2019t even born in the United States, but simply have a US parent \u2013 another way to acquire US citizenship \u201caccidentally\u201d.</p> <p>But renouncing your citizenship isn\u2019t without its consequences. Shier notes that if you support your child or an ageing parent with gifts, the recipients don\u2019t have to pay taxes on those as long as you\u2019re an American. Give up your citizenship, and they may end up paying gift tax on anything in excess of $14,000 a year. You\u2019ll be a foreigner in \u201cyour own\u201d country, limited to spending only a certain number of days here each year (depending on where you now live and have citizenship).</p> <p>So, how does President Trump sound now? Or will you just fight even harder to ensure that come November, Canada will look a little less tempting?</p>",

New Zealand\u2019s immigration website has lists of high-priority job categories that will get your immigration application fast-tracked. If you\u2019re younger than 30, you can get a one-year working holiday visa in either Australia or New Zealand. Germany has an \u201cartist visa\u201d program if you can prove you can support yourself through your writing, your design, art, music or other creative work. Older emigrants are best off either being wealthy and buying themselves a second citizenship or being lucky and having an Irish grandparent. Second, third and even fourth passports are becoming r\u00e9cherch\u00e9 accessories among the ultra-rich, and countries such as Malta are becoming accommodating in designing programs for them. Some require you to invest in real businesses; others just want you to keep funds on deposit. French actor G\u00e9rard Depardieu expatriated himself from his homeland to protest against not its leadership but its tax regime and became a Russian citizen. The ultimate long shot, if finances are no obstacle? Svalbard, the self-governing Norwegian territory whose residents carry guns to defend themselves against polar bears whenever they leave greater downtown Longyearbyen (population about 2,000), and where fresh vegetables are very scarce (as is daylight in winter). On the other hand, if you can support yourself financially, you won\u2019t need a visa or residence permit. But beware of what you wish for. You may leave the United States, but the US won\u2019t let you go so easily. Specifically, you may be residing overseas but the IRS insists that you keep filing tax returns. Nope, it doesn\u2019t matter that you don\u2019t live here any more, don\u2019t have any income or assets here, or don\u2019t even visit any more. All that counts is that you\u2019re still a citizen. The US is one of a tiny handful of countries in the world to tax non-resident citizens on their worldwide income, and the only major industrialized nation to do so. So before you stomp off to live overseas in a huff, you might want to be aware of just what you\u2019re signing up for: a lifetime of living under two tax regimes and (potentially) paying two sets of taxes. For instance, if you own a house in Canada, you won\u2019t get the benefit of mortgage interest deductions (that\u2019s Canadian tax policy at work). Under US law, you may find yourself paying capital gains tax when you sell it, even if Revenue Canada says you don\u2019t owe them a penny. Few groups are more aware of just what\u2019s involved than the \u201cAccidental Americans\u201d. One famous (former) member of this group is Boris Johnson, the former mayor of London. Born in the US, Johnson hasn\u2019t lived here since the age of five. He initially simply refused to file US tax returns \u2013 or to pay US taxes on the sale of his London house. And then (after quietly paying the bill) he renounced his citizenship. Many haven\u2019t lived in the US since their birth or childhood; some may not even have social security numbers. That doesn\u2019t matter. They were born there, and if they haven\u2019t relinquished their citizenship \u2013 a costly and cumbersome process \u2013 they have to keep filing tax returns and being aware that they can\u2019t invest in some kinds of mutual funds that might be standard products in their home countries but might trigger big tax liabilities in the US. While the number of Americans who have relinquished their citizenship, like Johnson, hit a record last year, that number still only just approached 4,300. The reason is the sheer complexity involved, suggests Suzanne Shier, chief wealth planning and tax strategist at Northern Trust. The US doesn\u2019t care that you left because you didn\u2019t like the political regime, \u201cthey look at objective facts, and those facts have a tax consequence. Then the question is whether you are defined as a \u2018covered expat\u2019 who will have to pay an exit tax or not.\u201d Many ordinary Americans aren\u2019t \u201ccovered expats\u201d \u2013 you\u2019d have to be fairly wealthy, outside your retirement accounts and home \u2013 but just the paperwork proving it is daunting, and the costs of doing that paperwork can be intimidating. \u201cAnd there aren\u2019t many people who deal with expatriation,\u201d Shier says. You\u2019d have to be committed to making it happen. Equally, there aren\u2019t many people overseas who will work with expatriates. Try to find an accountant able to fill out a US tax return in Prague or Ottawa; even opening a bank account these days has become incredibly difficult. The Foreign Account Tax Account Compliance Act (Fatca), designed to root out tax evaders, has made it difficult for Accidental Americans to even open a routine bank account in their \u201chome country\u201d. A growing number of Accidental Americans or long-term expatriates are getting letters from their banks threatening to close their accounts and take away their mortgages if they don\u2019t prove, within 30 days, that they have renounced their US citizenship. It has just become far too costly for those banks to comply with Fatca, and as a result, American expats are becoming, in the words of one advocate for Accidental Americans, \u201cfinancial pariahs\u201d. Some of the recipients of those letters haven\u2019t lived in the US since infancy and have never had a social security number, making it virtually impossible to do that. Some weren\u2019t even born in the United States, but simply have a US parent \u2013 another way to acquire US citizenship \u201caccidentally\u201d. But renouncing your citizenship isn\u2019t without its consequences. Shier notes that if you support your child or an ageing parent with gifts, the recipients don\u2019t have to pay taxes on those as long as you\u2019re an American. Give up your citizenship, and they may end up paying gift tax on anything in excess of $14,000 a year. You\u2019ll be a foreigner in \u201cyour own\u201d country, limited to spending only a certain number of days here each year (depending on where you now live and have citizenship). So, how does President Trump sound now? Or will you just fight even harder to ensure that come November, Canada will look a little less tempting?",

I mentioned this during the press conference earlier today: Turnbull said the two leaders would work together against the practice of cheap dumping of steel. Ciobo is asked what this means in practice. His explanation seems to mean it\u2019s status quo from an Australian perspective. Australia has an independent Anti-Dumping Commission, he says.</p> <p><strong>Steve Ciobo:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>They recently took that decision in relation to some steel products from out of China. What\u2019s important is Australia acts consistently with our world trade organisation obligations.

We know there is a global over-supply of steel. That is an incontrovertible fact. What we want to do is work out the best way forward. Clearly the United States has got concerns, the same as Australia does, we recognise that. This isn\u2019t something that is confined just to China, this is part of a global over-production of steel. I think it\u2019s important we continue to have discussions with country around the globe. We sent the relevant Assistant Minister to Europe to have discussions in the European Union in relation to steel dumping. We are proactive on this front. We will not let Australia be abused in regard to steel dumping.

So it\u2019s a fine judgement which we should leave it to the police to make as to the point in which they should intervene.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5733f11de4b035c26fc404d6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-12T03:02:29.407Z\">4.02am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>While I\u2019ve been alternating between Melinda and bulls various government folks have been up and about in Brisbane on the theme of domestic violence.

I suspect most people will reside in capital cities because that\u2019s where they have family members and that\u2019s where they have support networks within the refugee community. </p> </blockquote> <p><em>Q: Has your department told specific MPs refugees won\u2019t be resettled in their seats?</em></p> <p><strong>Peter Dutton:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Our department\u2019s job, as the immigration department, is to provide screening of people, and we\u2019ve screened some 9,500 and there have been about 5,000 visas issued, about 1,500 people that have arrived in Australia already. Our job as the immigration department is to screen those people to make sure we have the health checks done, to make sure we have the security checks done, and in terms of settlement services, well that\u2019s an issue for Mr Porter and the social service portfolio. From from an immigration department perspective, our job is to make sure that we deal with people to make sure that they\u2019re not going to be a threat to Australian society and we helped settled refugees in record numbers. Many of those coming from Syria and other parts of the Middle East will be Christians because they have been part of a persecuted minority there and that\u2019s part of the criteria that the government put in place when we made the announcement.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>Q: So there are no-go areas for Syrian refugees?</em></p> <p><strong>Peter Dutton:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Again, I don\u2019t know how you can draw the conclusion \u2013</p> </blockquote> <p><em>Q: That\u2019s what George Christensen is saying.</em></p> <p><strong>Peter Dutton:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As I said, refer back to what I just stated. I\u2019m not sure how you could try and represent that some other way. So that\u2019s the position of Immigration and Border Protection.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>Q: Have you had any discussions with Mr Christensen about settling refugees in Mackay or that area?</em></p> <p><strong>Peter Dutton:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I haven\u2019t spoken to Mr Christensen. We will work with people across the country and no doubt social services will do that work to help settle people in community housing. We\u2019re a generous nation when it comes to refugees and that\u2019s the position of this department, in terms of the Syrian intake, in terms of the 13,750 people that we will take this year within the refugee and humanitarian program. Otherwise, as I say, our job is to provide the security and health screening checks, issue visas and provide that assistance.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>Q: What\u2019s your message to MPs who say that Syrians aren\u2019t welcome in their areas?</em></p> <p><strong>Peter Dutton:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Again, I don\u2019t have any comment to make in relation to those issues, in terms of immigration, our job is to provide support to people, to come to our country. We welcome people that come here under the refugee and humanitarian program. That\u2019s been along established practice in this country and we will continue to provide that support.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-05-12T00:17:03.244Z\">at 1.17am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5733c7c4e4b0405426d4c360\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-05-12T00:04:03.822Z\">1.04am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back in Canberra the immigration minister, <strong>Peter Dutton,</strong> is advising reporters that Labor is falling to pieces on border protection.</p> <p><strong>Peter Dutton:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We have restored integrity to our borders and it seems to me that Mr Shorten has completely lost control of this issue and he needs to provide some clarification, some discipline of those members.

          "bodyText": "That\u2019s it for us tonight folks. Here were the elements of the day: The Panama Papers: It turns out Malcolm Turnbull, was previously listed as the director of a British Virgin Islands company that Mossack Fonseca acted as registered agent for, the Panama Papers have disclosed. The Panama Papers database lists Turnbull\u2019s historical role with the company more than 20 years ago, which was part of a subsidiary of an Australian publicly listed mining company Star Mining NL. Asked about his role this morning, the prime minister said there was \u201cno suggestion of any impropriety whatsoever\u201d. Turnbull spent the day campaigning in Victoria while Bill Shorten was in Queensland for his fourth day. Turnbull had a close encounter with a voter known as Melinda who expressed her full and frank views about the government cuts to family tax benefits. Shorten - who was continuing his campaign on education policy - got a lot of questions about aforementioned disendorsed Labor candidate for Fremantle Chris Brown. Turnbull and Shorten are both back in Sydney this evening to prepare for the debate tomorrow night at 6pm. Bridie Jabour will be back here in the morning while Katharine Murphy will blog the first debate. As I leave you, Peta Credlin and Kristina Kenneally are debating the merits of the day and the week on Sky. Credlin is talking about how \u201cdamaging\u201d the boats issue is for Labor. It\u2019s a scab you don\u2019t have to go very far to pull off. Good night. Shhhh, says Bruce. Just to drop this on you: Labor senate tickets. NSW 1. Sam Dastyari 2. Jennifer McAllister 3. Deborah O\u2019Neill 4. Doug Cameron 5. Tara Moriarty 6. Vivien Thomson VICTORIA 1. Kim Carr 2. Stephen Conroy 3. Jacinta Collins 4. Gavin Marshall 5. Jennifer Yang 6. Louise Persse QLD 1. Murray Watt 2. Anthony Chisholm 3. Claire Moore 4. Chris Ketter 5. Jane Casey 6. Cheryl Thompson WA 1. Sue Lines 2. Glenn Sterle 3. Patrick Dodson 4. Louise Pratt 5. Mark Reed 6. Susan Bowers SA 1. Penny Wong 2. Don Farrell 3. Alex Gallacher 4. Anne McEwen 5. Michael Allison 6. Bronwyn Gallacher TASMANIA 1. Anne Urquhart 2. Helen Polley 3. Carol Brown 4. Catryna Bilyk 5. John Short 6. Lisa Singh ACT 1. Katy Gallagher 2. David Smith NT 1. Nova Peris 2. Pat Honan Chris Brown, has appealed to Bill Shorten to review the evidence used to disendorse him over alleged failure to disclose 30-year old convictions. Shorten has already said it was \u201cclear\u201d Brown had not been \u201cforthcoming with the truth\u201d to the party. Maritime Union of Australia WA secretary, Chris Cain, has called the decision a \u201cdisgrace\u201d and a \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d. According to Cain, Brown\u2019s 12-month good behaviour bond is a spent conviction, meaning Brown is legally entitled to answer that he had not previously been convicted of an offence. Clearly Shorten and the Labor party have held Brown to a higher standard than that, and that\u2019s what\u2019s ruffled feathers. Back to Barnaby and the Walcha council decision. Tony Windsor has accused the National party and minister Paul Toole of inaction on the issue and for holding the decision back \u201cuntil it was politically convenient\u201d. Walcha council and the people of Walcha deserve greater respect from their elected members, who have played a cat and mouse game with them. An amalgamation could still be on the cards, so the premier\u2019s announcement today could well be a case of Walcha getting out of the frypan and into the fire. Is this just a cynical attempt to get the amalgamation issue off the political agenda until after the federal election on July 2? Education minister Simon Birmingham has spoken to the ABC about education funding and the ongoing stoush about which side has the better education policy. I will come back to that in a minute. But he was also asked about the South Australian Liberal Senate ticket. Birmo, as he is known on the twits, knocked Cory Bernardi off his number one perch. He was asked if this development was going to cause more divisions between the moderate and conservative camps in the Libs. Not at all. It\u2019s been an incredibly amicable approach and we are all at one in regards to the Senate ticket in SA. Dumped Labor Fremantle candidate Chris Brown has just made a short statement to the media: I have been honest and truthful with the Labor Party on paper and in person. There have been many positive comments about my future in the party. Fremantle has always been my home and I believe my future is here in Fremantle. I would ask Shorten to genuinely reassess the information used to disendorse my candidacy so that I can continue in our campaign. After receiving legal advice earlier today, I cannot make further comment at this time. But I may have additional comments for you in the morning. I hope the ALP resolves this issue quickly and fairly so we can focus on the issues that matter to the Australian people. Now I am going to tap into the brains trust - you dear readers - for any local knowledge regarding the mergers. Let me know what is happening in your district and whether it could impinge on the election results for your local MPs. From the government release: The minister has announced that he will proceed with the formation of the following councils: Armidale Regional Council (Armidale Dumaresq and Guyra) Canterbury-Bankstown Council (Bankstown and Canterbury) Central Coast Council (Gosford and Wyong) City of Parramatta Council (P\u2019matta and part of Hills, Auburn, Holroyd and Hornsby) Cumberland Council (Auburn and Holroyd) Edward River Council (Conargo and Deniliquin) Federation Council (Corowa and Urana) Georges River Council (Hurstville and Kogarah) Gundagai Council (Cootamundra and Gundagai) Snowy Monaro Regional Council (Bombala, Cooma Monaro and Snowy River) Hilltops Council (Boorowa, Harden and Young) Inner West Council (Ashfield, Leichhardt and Marrickville) Mid-Coast Council (Gloucester, Great Lakes and Greater Taree) Murray River Council (Murray and Wakool) Murrumbidgee Council (Jerilderie and Murrumbidgee) Northern Beaches Council (Manly, Pittwater and Warringah) Queanbeyan-Palerang Regional Council (Queanbeyan and Palerang) Snowy Valleys Council (Tumut and Tumbarumba) Western Plains Regional Council (Dubbo and Wellington) As far as I understand it, the council amalgamations are threatening to impinge on federal Liberal and National members in rural areas - even though it is a state government issue. I am not predicting that anyone is going to be thrown out but I know in my rural/regional area, people are very cranky. That is because local councils were offered (financial) carrots two years ago to consider their best options for merging. Councils were told their decisions would be respected. So they got together with their neighbouring councils, worked out who they liked and who they did not. Everyone did their homework, chose their dance partners and after endless meetings, put their proposals to the NSW government. Then, the NSW promptly ignored (many of) them. As a result, the ratepayers are revolting. Walcha was one council area that was deeply opposed and Barnaby was a Walcha boy. He was born there. Ish. The Walcha News have this afternoon reported this: Walcha Council has won the right to stand alone. Just back to New South Wales, where the state government has had a little rejig of its proposed amalgamations. The Baird government was proposing to force 35 amalgamations of local councils. Today the NSW government has cut that down to 19 forced amalgamations at this stage. A further nine amalgamations have been given in principle support by Premier Baird and the National local government minister Paul Toole but have been delayed. And three proposals are \u201cpending\u201d, which sounds like they are delayed for a bit. The reason this state political story interests us in the federal arena is that the amalgamation of Walcha council was causing huge headaches for Barnaby Joyce and his bid to see off a tilt by independent Tony Windsor. Surprise, surprise. Guess which councils are on the \u201cpending\u201d list? Newcastle and Port Stephens Dungog and Maitland Armidale-Dumaresq, Guyra, Walcha and Uralla Wilson bucks up and makes his pitch to the locals. In these circumstances the campaign is already under way. I\u2019m energised by that challenge, I\u2019m ready to make a strong case that I\u2019m the best person to represent this electorate. I have lived here virtually all my life, all my family live here. I\u2019ve raised my family here, I\u2019m on the board of my kids\u2019 school in Spearwood and over the last 12 years I\u2019ve made a significant contribution in public service and through leadership in local government, including five years as the deputy mayor here in Fremantle. I have deep and wide connections into this community. I understand how important it is that we get a proper investment in schools and education and in renewable energy and jobs, particularly for young people. I\u2019m passionate about marine conservation and about closing the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. This is a critical election for Australia\u2019s future. Despite Wilson winning the golden ticket, he was looking pretty worried. The WA Labor boss Tinley had to tell him to buck up. Smile, mate. It is a good-news story! If you are unfamiliar with the story, Paul Karp has written something here. From Paul\u2019s story, Chris Brown is a freight and logistics worker who has spent the past 12 months as a campaign coordinator for the Maritime Union of Australia. He won the preselection battle for Fremantle, beating Josh Wilson, a former staffer for the current Fremantle MP, Melissa Parke. Wilson, who is Fremantle\u2019s deputy mayor, beat Brown in a local ballot in March but the MUA candidate won endorsement at the ALP state council. The WA Labor secretary, Peter Tinley, is asked about the processes open to Brown. What are the appeal processes for Chris Brown, what avenues are open to him, why was the preselection so small and why did this not come to light? I\u2019m not a member of the national executive so can\u2019t answer detailed questions in relation to the process. The process was followed. Those questions are best sent to George Wright, our national secretary. Off the bat, Josh Wilson is asked about the Labor asylum seeker policy, given he has protested in the Let Them Stay rallies in the past. I support Labor\u2019s policy on asylum seekers. I look forward to a Labor government increasing our humanitarian intake by 100%, doubling our humanitarian intake and importing the UN convention into domestic law, providing a specific commissioner to look after the interests of refugee children. Those changes are incredibly important. They only happen under a Shorten Labor government. Good afternoon all. Long time no interact. More of that in a mo. The new Labor candidate for Fremantle, Josh Wilson, is now speaking. Wilson says he knows Chris Brown, the dumped candidate, and he is a good guy. Now I need to bid you farewell in order to devote some attention to my campaign podcast project with Lenore Taylor. I may return before close of business if I\u2019m incredibly efficient, otherwise my wonderful colleague Gabrielle Chan will drive the Politics Live bus until close of business today. If I\u2019m not back, thanks for reading, and I will see you tomorrow for the first leaders debate of the campaign. As the traffic rolls by various Adelaide folks are blasting their horns at Xenophon. If you\u2019ve ever wandered around the city with him, it\u2019s like being with a minor celebrity. It\u2019s really quite a thing. Nick Xenophon is in Adelaide, holding an empty pizza box. This might seem a bit strange unless you know Nick Xenophon. The pizza box is a pun around Pyne delivers, which is the catchphrase from Christopher Pyne\u2019s signage around Adelaide. Looks like the preferences stoush has taken a new turn. Xenophon says Christopher Pyne is being shamelessly mischievous by speculating that he\u2019s done a deal with Labor over preferences. Xenophon wants to know what Pyne is up to with preferences. Is he playing footsie with the Labor party to lock out the Xenophon candidates? Nick Xenophon: Christopher Pyne needs to clear the air as to whether he\u2019s been involved directly or indirectly with any discussions whatsoever with the Australian Labor party about the two major parties doing a cozy deal to knockout any Nick Xenophon Team candidates. Did I mention it\u2019s my birthday? IT\u2019S MY BIRTHDAY. Over. Street walking underway in Rockie. Reuters today has some context on the steel issue. \u201cLast month, China and other major steel producers failed to agree on measures to tackle the overcapacity crisis, prompting the United States, European Union and others to call for urgent action. China plans to shed 100-150 million tonnes of domestic crude steel capacity in the next five years in a bid to help tackle huge capacity overhangs that have saddled domestic firms with losses and debts.\u201d Given I had to skip over it quickly I\u2019m glad the trade minister Steve Ciobo is up now on the ABC being asked about the prime minister\u2019s conversation this morning with the US president on steel. I mentioned this during the press conference earlier today: Turnbull said the two leaders would work together against the practice of cheap dumping of steel. Ciobo is asked what this means in practice. His explanation seems to mean it\u2019s status quo from an Australian perspective. Australia has an independent Anti-Dumping Commission, he says. Steve Ciobo: They recently took that decision in relation to some steel products from out of China. What\u2019s important is Australia acts consistently with our world trade organisation obligations. We expect other countries to act consistently with the WTO so we want to act consistently with the WTO. We will continue to monitor the situation but we are always going to act in accordance with the World Trade Organisation obligations. Q: And working in partnership with the US, does that give greater heft to this push?What\u2019s the idea there? Steve Ciobo: I think a lot of countries face the same pressure. We know there is a global over-supply of steel. That is an incontrovertible fact. What we want to do is work out the best way forward. Clearly the United States has got concerns, the same as Australia does, we recognise that. This isn\u2019t something that is confined just to China, this is part of a global over-production of steel. I think it\u2019s important we continue to have discussions with country around the globe. We sent the relevant Assistant Minister to Europe to have discussions in the European Union in relation to steel dumping. We are proactive on this front. We will not let Australia be abused in regard to steel dumping. Of course, we are going to continue to pursue Australia\u2019s national interest to drive jobs and drive growth. Just one more. Q: Are these men meant to be released if they are not charged within 24 hours? George Brandis: That is entirely a matter for the police to decide whether or not to charge them. In any policing operation a judgement has to be made. The police like to leave it as late as possible to make an arrest so they can gather evidence. The intervention can\u2019t be so late that suspects escape or harm is done. So it\u2019s a fine judgement which we should leave it to the police to make as to the point in which they should intervene. While I\u2019ve been alternating between Melinda and bulls various government folks have been up and about in Brisbane on the theme of domestic violence. I\u2019m happy to stand corrected but I don\u2019t think it was new money, it was drawing attention to the sum of the parts. The attorney-general George Brandis was part of the posse and got a bunch of questions on the men picked up yesterday who were trying to leave Australia for Syria. Q: These men have been held for longer than 24 hours, do you expect charges to be laid? George Brandis: That is entirely a matter for the police. Q: Do you think they will be taken to Brisbane? George Brandis: That is entirely a matter for the police. (You get the drift.) Meanwhile Bill has moved on to bull. Perhaps time for a short break. Looks like Melinda is now holding an impromptu doorstop. Malcolm Turnbull is now in Hotham, a safe Labor electorate. A single mum named Melinda rushed towards the prime minister as he existed the Maranda engineering building in Moorabbin. Apart from tightly managed meet-and-greets in the businesses he has visited today, Turnbull hasn\u2019t been speaking to voters on the streets. But Melinda, who did not want to give her surname, heard word on the radio this morning Turnbull would be in the area and, seeing the camera crews outside the Maranda warehouse, took her opportunity. She said she was distressed by cuts to the Family Tax Benefit. \u201cIt was put in place to help parents afford to send their kids to school,\u201d she said. \u201cNow the cost of schooling is going up and up and up. And yet we\u2019re not getting anymore money. \u201cAnd now you\u2019re taking our family tax benefits away.\u201d She told Turnbull how hard it was to see her children\u2019s friends with ipads and new gadgets which she couldn\u2019t afford to give them given she was already struggling to provide them with the basics, like an equal education to other children. \u201cMy son went into year 10 this year and we were told over and over again to be careful about the subjects we chose. Only choose the subjects you can afford. I\u2019m ruining his chances to become something, to contribute to society. He\u2019s going to get a bad job because I can\u2019t afford to pay for the fancy-schmancy courses.\u201d Turnbull tried to ask questions about the names of her children and where they went to school, and said the government was committed to providing the best opportunities for young people to succeed. \u201cYou say that, but that\u2019s not what they\u2019re getting,\u201d she said. \u201cGive kids an opportunity to make something of themselves. Please. At the end of the day I don\u2019t care what you do to me but give the kids a chance.\u201d She said she had written to Tony Abbott last year about her concerns \u201cbut all I got back was a copy of the budget\u201d. So let\u2019s assess the sum of today\u2019s parts. Malcolm Turnbull began the day with reports he\u2019d been named in the Panama Papers, but he (and every other Coalition person in front of an open microphone) has responded to the news by saying this is a twenty year old story which contains absolutely nothing to see. The prime minister has picked up the pace on the hustings today, racing down to the Mornington Peninsula, and indulging a longer press conference before powering through to a second event, where he encountered a mum named Melinda. More of this shortly. Bill Shorten is talking education in Queensland but he\u2019s still trying to fight his way through rolling questions about the views of his MPs and candidates on boat turnbacks and offshore processing, and inconveniently, Labor\u2019s candidate in the seat of Fremantle has had to be be pushed out the backdoor for failing to disclose spent convictions during the preselection process. Happy birthday, Bill. Campaigns wait for no summary. Let\u2019s crack on. Just while I\u2019m getting my act together on summations. I\u2019m sure Mel Davey will fill us in. To summaries. For readers who have been with me all morning, please note I\u2019ve corrected my post from 10.58am on the caretaker convention. I\u2019m a numpty. That is all. Summary next. In Marrickville, inner-city Sydney, a primary school hall has erupted in applause. Not for its special guest, introduced by one child as \u201cthe honorary Albanese\u201d \u2013 but because Marrickville Public School has just won a $100,000 national competition to redesign its playground. Albo, once on his feet, says he has a hard act to follow. \u201cI don\u2019t have any announcements,\u201d he says. In a press conference afterwards he was asked about a video that emerged on Wednesday showing his Greens opponent, Jim Casey, appearing to prioritise a strong protest movement over the election of a Labor government. He spared no quarter for Casey: \u201cWhen people think about what that means, that dissent and demonstrations are the end in itself for my main opponent, then they would be very disappointed,\u201d he said. \u201cHis view appears to be to be a rather old-fashioned, extreme view that if people are oppressed enough they\u2019ll rise up \u2026 I entered political [life] to uplift people, that\u2019s what drives me each and every day. \u201cI find it extraordinary that someone would seek to enter parliament with those views in 2016. And it\u2019s not surprising that mainstream media organisations, be it the Daily Telegraph, the SMH, the ABC, Channel Nine and others, have expressed a view in the last 24 hours that my main opponent\u2019s view are outside mainstream politics. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not surprising given that he has spent a considerable period of his political activism not as a member of the Greens, but as a member of the International Socialist Organisation that doesn\u2019t believe in parliamentary politics, that doesn\u2019t mean reforms are possibly by engaging in the mainstream political system.\u201d Casey has written in Guardian Australia today laying out his views, including that capitalism \u201cis something more likely to collapse under its own weight\u201d than be overthrown in the streets. A picture from Magic Mike requiring one of those mmmmmmwwaaaahahaha\u2019s. Back to the Mornington Peninsula for a moment. You have to feel sorry for the Liberal candidate for Dunkley, Chris Crewther. He blended into the background as retiring MP Bruce Billson stole the show as the Turnbull campaign bus stopped at the Mornington Brewery. It was Billson greeting reporters with hugs and exclaiming \u201cThere\u2019s a reason every season to be in Dunkley\u201d. Billson, 50, has held the seat in outer metropolitan Melbourne since 1996, and is popular in the electorate which the Liberals hold by 5.6%. But some reports say his popularity is worth a couple of per cent alone, and Labor hope his retirement will be enough for them to steal the seat. And so, Billson was rolled out for Turnbull\u2019s visit, promoting the government\u2019s free trade agreement with China and the importance of supporting small businesses. \u201cI\u2019m not sure which beer would best be paralleled to the election campaign,\u201d he says, but adds he is confident the result for Turnbull will be \u201cfirst class. A bit like these beers, which go around the world and create economic opportunity and livelihood for the people here in Dunkley.\u201d After a walk around the brewery, Crewther finally appeared. Is the 32 year-old worried that without the Billson factor, the electorate will be hard to hold? \u201cHe\u2019s been a spectacular candidate for the past 20 years in Dunkley and a strong community advocate,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I hope to do the same.\u201d Well that morning has thundered like a freight train. Before I move to a proper lunchtime summary I\u2019ll use the next couple of posts to clear up fragments from the last couple of hours, hopefully in orderly fashion. In Melbourne, Scott Morrison is shouting above the sound of heavy equipment about how Malcolm Turnbull knows about business. This is in response to a shouted question about the Panama Papers. Scott Morrison: The prime minister dealt with that fairly comprehensively today in his earlier statements. There\u2019s no suggestion of any impropriety from the PM and I don\u2019t think you\u2019re suggesting anything by raising that in the press conference today, I am sure. That was 20 years ago and it\u2019s all about there in the public sphere and \u2013 the thing about Malcolm Turnbull is he has had a lot of experience. He has had a lot of experience in supporting businesses not unlike this one. He has invested in them. He has created them. He has employed people over his lifetime. And he\u2019s got a lot of experience in how to drive economic policy in this country which sees our economy move through this transition. That is what our national economic plan is all about. It\u2019s all about ensuring that we have the right set of policies that back businesses like this one so they can put more people on. The Labor leader ends this outing by asking himself a question on his birthday \u2013 what is he getting for his birthday? This is clearly leading to a zinger of some kind, ah yes .. Bill Shorten: My present is standing right next to me. That would be wife Chloe, who has the grace to look both delighted and mildly embarrassed by the whole shtick. He plants a kiss on her cheek. Good question here on education. How do we actually know this money will be spent in the regions given the federal government doesn\u2019t actually run schools? Shorten motions in the party\u2019s education spokesperson, Kate Ellis, who says there will be transparency mechanisms. Kate Ellis: In terms of the funding for regional schools, we have made very clear that this funding will only be directed towards the evidence-based programs which we know lift student out comes and make a real difference. The only people that were interested in sending a blank cheque when it came to school funding was the current government when they wrote to the states and territories, said that funding for schools would be no strings attached ... Q: How will we see evidence of that? Will it be made public? Kate Ellis: Absolutely. There was already accountability mechanisms which were written into the current agreements. We are being very clear that taxpayers deserve to know how every dollar is being well spent. Equally parents deserve to know that that money is going to towards the program that will lift their child\u2019s student out comes. Back to Fremantle. Q: What is the problem in Fremantle is it the conviction or the fact they weren\u2019t disclosed? Bill Shorten: It is on clear that serious matters the candidate wasn\u2019t forth coming with the truth to the Labor party. Q: He said he disclosed that four weeks ago to an ALP staffer who said this shouldn\u2019t be a problem. Bill Shorten: The national secretary of the Labor party [has been] ... investigating these matters. He found there had been a deliberate misleading. He recommended that, therefore, this person shouldn\u2019t be our candidate. I 100% back that decision. The national executive today will pick a new candidate for Fremantle. Bill Shorten gets two questions on the growth projections associated with his education policy, the OECD figures, that I mentioned earlier on today. Shorten says there is a clear case to fund schools according to need. Bill Shorten: I have not run into a single parent in the big cities or the small towns or the great provincial cities of Australia like Rockhampton where they\u2019ve come up to me and said: \u201cGee, Bill, we don\u2019t want to see more money for our kids in education.\u201d Nothing could be further from the truth. Secondly, is there a serious argument being mounted by some conservative commentators who want to maintain a two-tiered education system in this country that not spending money on this country is not an investment in the future? Q: Will Josh Wilson replace Chris Brown if he supports boat turnbacks? Bill Shorten: He is a good candidate and he will be the candidate if he is preselected. Let\u2019s be clear about this issue -the Labor party, I think, quite straight up with the Australian people, debated these issues. We debated them last July. There is grave disquiet in the community about the treatment of people on Manus and Nauru ... but there is 100% resolve amongst the Labor party and I believe the vast bulk of the Australian people, to stop the drownings at sea. A second question to Leisa Neaton, Labor\u2019s candidate for Dawson. Q: Can I just clarify something - you said you have never argued against boat turnbacks but on your Facebook you said despite a compelling case the vote did not go our way on the conference floor: How that is that not saying you didn\u2019t support turnbacks? Leisa Neaton: That debate was all about people seeking asylum. It was a long debate and I didn\u2019t have a vote in that debate. I was a participant. Once preselected there\u2019s a party position and that is the position I take. There\u2019s a high lob on Tony Abbott campaigning in Queensland, does the Liberal party have two leaders? Yes, quite, thinks Shorten. Quite. Q: Do you regret that Chris Brown was chosen as a candidate for Fremantle considering he has now disclosed his criminal past? Bill Shorten: I am very disappointed by this set of events. The Labor party has acted and we\u2019re moving on from it. The national secretary has made a recommendation to me. When I received the formal report I have made it clear I endorse the recommendation and that is - the party is going to make its decisions today. They will do so and I believe that Josh Wilson, the deputy mayor of Fremantle, will be a very good candidate in Fremantle. Furthermore: It is clear that the party processes were not followed. On very important matters. The party has made a recommendation to me that he should not be the endorsed candidate. And I have absolutely supported that decision, 100%. (Bye bye Chris Brown). Into questions now. Q: Do you need to instil more party discipline around your refugee policy? One of your candidates has likened the process to Nazi concentration camps. Bill Shorten: I don\u2019t accept the language that was used at all by our candidate. And let me again state the Labor party\u2019s dealt with this difficult issue at our conference last year. The local candidate is asked whether she supports the party\u2019s turnback policy. She says she does. The Labor leader is speaking to reporters now on education. Today\u2019s pledge is $1.8bn of the $3.8bn dollars promised in additional needs based funding for schools will flow to schools in regional areas. A Labor man has materialised beside my desk hotly disputing my advice to you about the caretaker convention. He says the advice on the department of prime minister and cabinet website says caretaker begins with the dissolution of the House. Never mind the writs. Here\u2019s the PM&amp;C advice. The caretaker period begins at the time the House of Representatives is dissolved and continues until the election result is clear or, if there is a change of government, until the new government is appointed. Dutton wins, not Pyne. I\u2019ll double check this once I get through Bill Shorten, who is talking right now. Labor\u2019s candidate in Fremantle Chris Brown has held a short media conference to say the only reason the ALP knows about his prior spent convictions is because he brought it to their attention. According to the report in The Australian this morning, \u201cBrown pleaded guilty as a 19-year-old to assaulting a police officer during an altercation with a group of men in 1985. He received a 12-month good behaviour bond and the conviction was expunged in 2011. When he was 18, Brown was charged with drink driving and had his licence suspended for three months. This charge was also removed from his record in accordance with the Spent Convictions Act.\u201d Q: Can you talk us through the circumstances of how it came about? Chris Brown: Yeah, I was at a festival in Claremont and I was king hit. I was held down by two individuals, punched by a third, pulled to my feet bloodied and dazed. My vision was impaired. I was struggling, I got an arm free to defend myself thinking I was going to be attacked. I was later informed contact was made by a police officer who had come to rescue me. Brown says he\u2019s not obliged to put his past record out there, but it\u2019s my history and I do that to teach a lesson to my kids. Meanwhile, in the beef capital of Australia. I was trying to have a little dramatic build in my question earlier about who is right about caretaker \u2013 P Duddy or Christopher Pyne \u2013 but of course you folks are all so on it you\u2019ve piled in on Twitter already. We are in caretaker as of 16 May, which is next week. On a procedural question, if you ever have to pick a side, go with Pyne every time. Correction, 12.15pm: As a subsequent blog post makes clear, the advice on the caretaker convention from the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet indicates caretaker is now in force. I had a brain lapse by conflating the issuing of the writs (next week) with caretaker. Nope, nope, nope. Caretaker happens when the House is dissolved. So as well as making this clear so as not to mislead readers, I need to add the following: on a procedural question, don\u2019t go with Pyne every time, because sometimes he\u2019s wrong, and sometimes I\u2019m wrong too. I will issue a correction however, every time I am, and I won\u2019t erase my error from the record. Interesting that the prime minister\u2019s press conference ran longer today than it has the last couple of days. Over a barrel? Roll out the barrel? Is this a barrel of laughs? I need to tidy up the immigration minister from earlier on before I check what pictures I have from the Turnbull outing, and share a few thoughts about it. Peter Dutton was asked in his press conference earlier about Manus and Australia\u2019s obligations to the detainees \u2013 questions he attempted to dead bat. Then he was asked about why Green Senator Sarah Hanson-Young is banned from visiting detention centres throughout the election campaign. Does that apply to all federal MPs? We covered this issue yesterday on Politics Live. Dutton in addressing the point this morning made a crack about Guardian Australia being a spokesperson for Hanson-Young (news to us) before observing the answer to the question was the caretaker convention. Peter Dutton: That\u2019s been a long-standing arrangement. As I understand, operating under both sides of government in this country and Senator Hanson-Young, through her mouthpiece in The Guardian, really needs to reassess why she wants to mislead, and why the Guardian wants to mislead the Australian public. This would have all been good sport, had he not been immediately contradicted by the innovation minister Christopher Pyne, who was answering questions at a separate event in Adelaide. Pyne was asked why he held a defence event in Adelaide without advising the state Labor minister. He said because the government was still governing. Christopher Pyne: We\u2019re not yet in caretaker mode. Q: When will you intend to visit a shopping centre or street walk to meet voters out of these carefully stage managed opportunities? Malcolm Turnbull: I look forward to that. I\u2019m sorry you weren\u2019t able to join us yesterday on the train. There were lots of voters on the train and I am getting out and about all around the country. Q: Did you catch the train this morning? Malcolm Turnbull: No, I did not get the train this morning. In fact there isn\u2019t a train station at Mornington. There is to Frankston. Now to George Christensen\u2019s comments on the Syrian refugees. Malcolm Turnbull makes it clear that as well as his chat with Barack Obama, he\u2019s also spoken to his Queensland MP about his comments. Turnbull says Christensen was expressing a view about the economic downturn in his region. Malcolm Turnbull: I understand that Mr Christensen was expressing a view about - he is concerned about the economic downturn in his region and he is concerned that the introduction, if you like, of people coming through the humanitarian program could - would come into a region where there aren\u2019t enough jobs and that\u2019s the basis on which he\u2019s made those observations as he\u2019s advised me. Another question on the Panama Papers. Was the company paying its fair share of tax in Australia? Malcolm Turnbull: Let me say to you that the company in which Neville Wran and I were directors was an Australian listed company and had it made any profits which it did not, regrettably, it certainly would have paid tax inAustralia, obviously you haven\u2019t studied the accounts of the company concerned. Back to Christensen. Do you think he has a point? Turnbull is back to the downturn in Queensland. Plainly the objective, when you bring in refugees into Australia, indeed any arrivals into Australia, is to put them in a position where they are given the skills and the opportunities to get into work. That is the whole objective. Questions about a WA poll, NSW council amalgamations, and whether he likes beer or wine. On that score he likes lager. So noted. Q: PM, will you be campaigning with Tony Abbott over the next 7 weeks? Malcolm Turnbull: Can I just say to you that Mr Abbott is campaigning for the return of the Turnbull government and if the occasion arises, no doubt we can. We may be able to campaign in Warringah in his electorate. Turnbull is asked first whether he has full confidence in the Liberal party\u2019s preselection processes given the spat about Labor\u2019s candidate in Fremantle. Turnbull doesn\u2019t express it in those terms. Malcolm Turnbull: We have a very rigorous process. Now to the Panama Papers. Q: Are you happy being named in the Mossack Fonseca files? Malcolm Turnbull chuckles. Well can I just say to you that as the article acknowledged, there is no suggestion of any impropriety whatsoever. There is nothing new there. The company concerned was a wholly owned subsidiary of a publicly listed Australian company. So an ASX listed company of which Neville Wran and I were both directors for about two years. So it is - the involvement is very, very well known and as the article acknowledges, there\u2019s no suggestion of any impropriety at all. The two leaders also spoke about the steel glut, and about joint action to address that. As well as exciting times in craft beer the prime minister confirms he\u2019s chatted this morning to the US president, Barack Obama. Malcolm Turnbull: I should note that I\u2019ve had a good discussion this morning with President Obama on a range of global and regional issues, one of which was the progress of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal which, as you know, is another one of the big trade deals that has been agreed. It has to be ratified by the Congress. The president is confident it can be ratified before the end of the year. So we\u2019re very encouraged by that. We talked about the security situation in the Middle East and the president briefed me on developments there from his perspective and I did the same from ours. And he thanked Australia for what he described as our extraordinary contribution to the battle against Isil and Daesh. We also talked about security issues in our region and confirmed our strong commitment to freedom of navigation throughout the region and the importance of any territorial disputes being resolved peacefully and in accordance with international law. There\u2019s more in Dutton but I have to move past him for now to the prime minister, who is inspired by craft beer. Reporters move on to other issues to hand. Q: George Christensen says he\u2019s been advised Syrian refugees won\u2019t be resettled in his seat of Dawson. Do you know whether the department has advised MPs who have asked, that Syrians won\u2019t be resettled in their seats? Are there no-go areas for Syrian refugees? Peter Dutton: The federal government obviously works with the states and you will remember that the state premiers and territory leaders were falling over themselves to provide support to the 12,000 people being brought in and we welcome that. And we\u2019ve been working closely with states and territories. In the end, people make decisions about where it is they will reside. I suspect most people will reside in capital cities because that\u2019s where they have family members and that\u2019s where they have support networks within the refugee community. Q: Has your department told specific MPs refugees won\u2019t be resettled in their seats? Peter Dutton: Our department\u2019s job, as the immigration department, is to provide screening of people, and we\u2019ve screened some 9,500 and there have been about 5,000 visas issued, about 1,500 people that have arrived in Australia already. Our job as the immigration department is to screen those people to make sure we have the health checks done, to make sure we have the security checks done, and in terms of settlement services, well that\u2019s an issue for Mr Porter and the social service portfolio. From from an immigration department perspective, our job is to make sure that we deal with people to make sure that they\u2019re not going to be a threat to Australian society and we helped settled refugees in record numbers. Many of those coming from Syria and other parts of the Middle East will be Christians because they have been part of a persecuted minority there and that\u2019s part of the criteria that the government put in place when we made the announcement. Q: So there are no-go areas for Syrian refugees? Peter Dutton: Again, I don\u2019t know how you can draw the conclusion \u2013 Q: That\u2019s what George Christensen is saying. Peter Dutton: As I said, refer back to what I just stated. I\u2019m not sure how you could try and represent that some other way. So that\u2019s the position of Immigration and Border Protection. Q: Have you had any discussions with Mr Christensen about settling refugees in Mackay or that area? Peter Dutton: I haven\u2019t spoken to Mr Christensen. We will work with people across the country and no doubt social services will do that work to help settle people in community housing. We\u2019re a generous nation when it comes to refugees and that\u2019s the position of this department, in terms of the Syrian intake, in terms of the 13,750 people that we will take this year within the refugee and humanitarian program. Otherwise, as I say, our job is to provide the security and health screening checks, issue visas and provide that assistance. Q: What\u2019s your message to MPs who say that Syrians aren\u2019t welcome in their areas? Peter Dutton: Again, I don\u2019t have any comment to make in relation to those issues, in terms of immigration, our job is to provide support to people, to come to our country. We welcome people that come here under the refugee and humanitarian program. That\u2019s been along established practice in this country and we will continue to provide that support. Back in Canberra the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, is advising reporters that Labor is falling to pieces on border protection. Peter Dutton: We have restored integrity to our borders and it seems to me that Mr Shorten has completely lost control of this issue and he needs to provide some clarification, some discipline of those members. But there is open revolt within the Labor party and it is obvious to all Australians that Bill Shorten has lost control of this issue and that the wheels have clearly fallen off the Labor party\u2019s policy on border protection and people don\u2019t want to see people drowning at sea or new boat arrivals and that\u2019s what Labor is promising at the moment. You have now entered Bruce Country. Possibly the first time the prime minister has been compared to a craft beer. The Australian Medical Association is in parliament at the moment to try and get some focus on health in this election. The AMA president, Brian Owler, says this election should be a referendum on the public health system. Brian Owler: We\u2019ve had now three years of surprises from the current government in terms of health policy. What we want to see is each party outline in advance what their plans are for health in this country. We want to see a coherent plan for health. The Daily Telegraph reports this morning that the former prime minister Tony Abbott has been mobbed campaigning in Mosman over the past few days. A little while back Abbott wasn\u2019t a fan of changing the concessions on superannuation, but he appears to have now fallen into line, with one tiny inflection point. Reporter Caroline Tang takes up the story. Mr Abbott gave diplomatic responses when asked about the controversial proposed changes to superannuation in the federal budget which will hit lifelong savers hard. \u201cThere is a degree of anxiety about that particular budget announcement but people are just as anxious about Labor\u2019s policy as they are about the Coalition\u2019s policy,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no easy way to get the deficit down. There is no painless way to cut government spending and what the government is trying to do here is to restore superannuation to its proper purpose. The proper purpose of superannuation is not to be a wealth creation vehicle, it\u2019s to be a vehicle for giving people a reasonable retirement income. So I think the government is absolutely on the right track and as I said, I think it\u2019s a gutsy call by the government. Q: His ministers have come out today saying that this was in the 1990s, it was a long time ago so isn\u2019t it fair, given that Chris Brown [Labor\u2019s candidate in Fremantle] also says this is something that happened to him when he was 18? Penny Wong: If the test is how long ago things occurred then I suppose that Malcolm Turnbull and Tony Abbott will be apologising to Julia Gillard for the pursuit of her for matters which occurred 20 years ago. Labor\u2019s campaign spokeswoman Penny Wong has found the cameras now to pick up on the Panama Papers. She says Malcolm Turnbull needs to provide full disclosure. Penny Wong: On the front page of one of today\u2019s major papers we have Malcolm Turnbull listed as being involved in a company established in a tax haven, a company which Mossack Fonseca established and a company that\u2019s involved in a Siberian gold mine, a company which allegedly made payments to Russian politicians about its activities. Well I see in the papers that Mr Turnbull has had a spokesperson answer questions. Those answers seem to suggest \u2018I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t recall, it was a long time ago\u2019. Well, this is a man who is the prime minister of the country and he\u2019s running to be the prime minister again and the standards which are expected of him are high standards and he should provide a full and frank explanation of his involvement in this company which was established in a tax haven. But more than that, we shouldn\u2019t have to wait for a good journo to tell Australians about this. We shouldn\u2019t have to wait for a paper to run a story about the prime minister\u2019s involvement in this company. The prime minister should be full and frank with the Australian people about his business affairs. He should be clear. How many other companies was he involved in which were established in tax havens? How many other companies was he involved in that Mossack Fonseca was involved with? He should be very up-front in answering questions about what he did or didn\u2019t know about the activities of this company in relation to the Siberian gold mine. Just tracking back to Mathias Cormann\u2019s comments about the growth dividend from education funding, he\u2019s bouncing off this story in the Australian this morning by David Crowe. Bill Shorten stands accused of misleading voters over the boost to growth from his $37.4bn school funding plan by claiming an economic lift \u201cstraight away\u201d from the spending, despite economic research that shows the gains would take decades. In a blow to the opposition leader\u2019s economic case, the author of the global study used to justify the Labor spending told The Australian there would be no \u201cimmediate\u201d boost to growth \u2014 and that more money was not the key factor in producing the economic benefit. \u201cThere is no systematic relationship between what is spent on schools and any added achievement,\u201d Stanford University\u2019s Eric Hanushek said last night. Quick translation about all this in case it\u2019s bamboozling. Labor is claiming education spending delivers a growth dividend to the economy that\u2019s more durable and equitable than a tax cut to business. The government says that\u2019s nonsense. The skirmishing over the spreadsheets is part of efforts by both sides to discredit each other\u2019s policy pathways for growth. Hope that makes sense. We\u2019re off to the Mornington Peninsula Brewery in the electorate of Dunkley. The seat has become a marginal one after former small business minister Bruce Billson retired in November, after Turnbull demoted him. But Billson\u2019s popularity in the electorate is key to the Liberals\u2019 success there, and Labor is now eyeing it off. Rumour on the bus is that Billson will be joining Turnbull this morning. 5.5% is the margin to the government. Team Turnbull is heading to a brewery on the Mornington Peninsula. Early in the campaign to be driven to drink. As we speak, Magic Mike Bowers is speeding up the Dandenong Freeway on the Turnbull bus. Let\u2019s all wave to Mike. Speaking of campaign spokespeople, the Coalition spokesman Mathias Cormann is holding a press conference in the Mural Hall. Cormann is criticising Bill Shorten for the growth assumptions associated with Labor\u2019s education policy. He\u2019s then asked whether the government has made any growth assumptions associated with its own offering. No, Cormann says. Q: Does the prime minister have questions to answer over the Panama Papers? Mathias Cormann: No, is the short answer. Obviously this is more than twenty years ago. There is absolutely no suggestion of any wrongdoing. Thanks to Bridie for battling the wall of sound and the page one PDFs and welcome good people of Politics Live to our coverage of the election campaign, it\u2019s delightful to be with you. The morning news cycle for this campaign Thursday is exploding candidates: there\u2019s Chris Brown, a former MUA official with undisclosed convictions who is Labor\u2019s candidate for Fremantle and perhaps won\u2019t be for much longer; and The Australian tells me there\u2019s a video in which the Greens candidate in Grayndler, Jim Casey, is filmed saying he would prefer Tony Abbott to win the next election rather than Bill Shorten because it would \u201cboost unions and ferment more protests.\u201d Thus far Malcolm Turnbull being named in the Panama Papers hasn\u2019t really kicked hard into the news cycle, but it\u2019s only 8.30am, and the campaign spokespeople are only just getting under way. To the campaign road trains: Malcolm Turnbull is in Melbourne, then Adelaide, then Sydney, which sounds like a small intensification of activity. Bill Shorten is up north still, in Rockhampton I believe. It\u2019s also the Labor leader\u2019s birthday. Happy birthday. Let\u2019s power on into Thursday. Today\u2019s comments thread is open for your business. Visual maestro Magic Mike is up and about on the twits \u2013 he\u2019s @mpbowers and I\u2019m @murpharoo. If you speak Facebook you can join my daily forum here. And if you want a behind-the-scenes look at the day and the looming campaign, give Mike a follow on Instagram. You can find him here. Onwards into Thursday. On that note my time with you this morning has drawn to a close and it is now time for Katharine Murphy to fire up the keyboard. Mike Bowers tells me Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s bus has left the Melbourne CBD for an hour and twenty minute trip and is currently chugging along the Dandenong freeway. Cheerio Malcolm Turnbull has been named in the Panama Papers though there are no allegations of improper conduct, in a story on the front page of the Australian Financial review today. Arthur Sinodinos has come out swinging against it: That is a dead horse being flogged, it\u2019s a 20 year matter, it\u2019s old news, they just want to run it because they can, the Fin Review on its front page should be debating policy instead of behaving like a downmarket tabloid. Arthur Sinodinos just said the asylum seeker debate is not a political debate - to much laughter. On his criticisms of Labor candidates disagreeing with asylum policy, what is he suggesting, that they should be disendorsed for objecting? What happened within the Howard government is that we got the problem under control, and yes there\u2019s a Liberal philosophy and tradition you can without punishment express dissent [referring to Liberals who objected to offshore detention at the time]. What we are talking about here is Labor candidates lining up to say that as a matter of conscience they cannot support asylum seeker policy, as a matter of conscience they will unravel it. Labor has disendorsed a candidate in Western Australia who did not disclose a drink driving conviction from the 1980s and a charge of assault a police officer that was expunged. Is it fair to disendorse over such old charges? Chris Bowen: There are two issues here, the Labor party has acted swiftly and appropriately, there are the convictions but there are also the lack of disclosure. If a candidate tells us then we weigh it up, if they don\u2019t disclose then that\u2019s the problem. If a candidate can\u2019t tell us we can\u2019t in good conscience put them forward. Arthur Sinodinos and Chris Bowen are on radio national talking election strategy. Neither side has electrified the electorate this week, so what\u2019s the thinking in their camps? Sinodinos first: It\u2019s a marathon not a sprint, we can\u2019t excite everyone everyday. If you have them in a pitch of excitement every day they will get exhausted. What both sides will do is keep rolling out policy. The government has had no big policy announcement which is odd for an election campaign. We are out there selling the budget and that\u2019s important. Budgets can be a slow burn, we are going through process of explaining what\u2019s in it. Now it\u2019s Bowen\u2019s turn to explain where the sizzle is: It\u2019s a two month campaign, which is very long, what we are doing is leading the policy debate. We are delighted to have a debate about education and we\u2019ve announced an eduction policy every day of this campaign. When Arthur says he\u2019s selling the budget, I was tempted to ask \u2018how\u2019s that going for him?\u2019 it\u2019s unravelling. Malcolm Turnbull has started the morning with a yarn to none other than Barack Obama. I wonder if there was a brief moment where the president thanked his stars he doesn\u2019t have to face another campaign. George Christensen is hosting Tony Abbott in north Queensland today where Abbott will be campaigning. Christensen is fresh from getting assurances from the minister for multicultural affairs that no Syrian refugees will be settled in his seat in Mackay. Fairfax Media has modelling on how the 2016 budget will affect Australians \u2013 and it\u2019s the poorest who will be hit hardest. Single-parent families in the poorest 20% of households will be worst affected by the 2018-19 financial year, mainly through scheduled cuts to family tax benefits and hikes in tobacco excise. The modelling is from the Australian National University and shows the single-parent families will be $1,407 worse off a year, the equivalent of 3.6% of average incomes for that group. Couples with children in the poorest fifth of households will lose $1,146, or 2.7% of average incomes, should all budget measures be successfully introduced. By contrast, relatively well-off couples with children in the second-top income quintile will be $392 a year better off by 2018-19. The Australian is on day three of the man who dared question on Q&amp;A why people on very decent money ($80,000 +) get tax cuts when people (like him) on welfare and very low incomes could use it more. On Chris Brown, the Labor candidate in WA dumped over convictions from the 1980s, the maritime union is not happy and believes the national executive is overreacting. Brown was charged with assaulting a police officer and drink driving. The assault charge was later expunged. A maritime union official on ABC radio this morning: He didn\u2019t think it was an issue, would you, 30 years on? he He was king hit from behind ... we are not all from the Salvation Army. Maybe not the best analogy. After hinting earlier in the week that the government could shift on the potential retrospectively of the superannuation, Julie Bishop is not budging on the government line that it does not need to be considered, because the changes are simply not retrospective. It is prospective, it\u2019s about the tax rate that applies to future earnings on super, nobody is being asked to pay tax on past earnings. The point I was making was self evident, there is a scrutinisation process. But she concedes theres a concerns that the changes are retrospective? Measures in relation to super often attract this type of attention, what we have to ensure is the system is fair, that there is integrity in it. Briefly, on the five alleged jihadis arrested over a plan to ride a tinny to Indonesia to then fight in Syria. Does this mean confiscating passports not necessarily effective? Well, we have stopped them. Five men have been arrested in relation to suspected breaches of anti-terrorism legislation and as it remains I\u2019m not going to go into too much detail. It does show law enforcement agencies and security intelligence agencies are cooperating closely. The foreign minister, Julie Bishop, is now up on radio national and she is being pushed on potential Liberal preference deals with the Greens but she will not be moved. Preference deals are a matter for campaign headquarters, I don\u2019t get involved. Well that may be, but what does she think of the concept of doing deals with Greens? Campaign headquarters work out the arrangements it\u2019s not a matter for me as deputy leader. So if there was a hung parliament, and both parties say they would refuse to deal with the Greens, would Australia be sent back to the polls? These are all hypotheticals, what I do know is when Julia Gillard formed an alliance with the Greens we had some disastrous consequences for Australia, it was chaos. So it is inevitable we would go back to the polls? This is a hypothetical, what we are focused on is getting as many votes as we can. Only the Coalition has a plan for jobs and growth, only the Coalition can keep the borders safe. Bishop is having an impressively on-message morning. The government was proudly brandishing modelling just before the election was called (was that only last week?) that its Direct Action plan could meet Australia\u2019s long-term climate promises. Well, that modelling was actually assuming the Coalition would turn its policy into a type of emissions trading scheme, Lenore Taylor reports. Peter Holt, associate at Energetics, told Guardian Australia that the policies would only achieve those reductions with changes \u2013 either large funding top-ups to the ERF (estimated by others at at least $6bn) or a strengthening of the safeguards mechanism so it turned into a baseline and credit emissions trading scheme. Let them eat cake! After the Daily Telegraph\u2019s endorsement of Anthony Albanese yesterday they have him writing today on ... how the Greens candidate actually has a Tony Abbott agenda. Creative. Jim Casey, the Greens candidate in Grayndler, has been recorded saying in 2014 he would rather see Abbott be prime minister than Bill Shorten in a society where anti-war, women\u2019s and climate change movements were growing. Albanese writes: I don\u2019t want to see people oppressed so that they rise up. I want to work through the parliament to uplift people in my electorate and people right around the nation. I don\u2019t want bigger demonstrations. I want better outcomes for people and improvements in our quality of life. For Mr Casey, protest has become an end in itself. Ged Kearney, from the ACTU, is on radio national talking about legal advice the council of unions has received which says the government\u2019s intern program could be illegal. It\u2019s not a job, it\u2019s an internship, so how could it be illlegal? It\u2019s not necessarily an internship either, it\u2019s so unclear and so murky and we have a very varied indication of how it is run. But what we do know is that the minister says there has to be a real prospect of ongoing employment. Our advice indicates that for all intents and purposes it is an employment contract and they should be paid the minimum wage. I think it\u2019s unfortunate the government has used the term internship. Asked whether it will come under the welfare act or the Fair Work Act, Kearney says that is unclear. For all intents and purposes it should come under the Fair Work Act. To avoid exploitation of these workers, and they will be workers, it should be under the fair work act. Paying employers to take on free labour, there is so much wrong with a plan like that. When pointed out that the scheme is not intended to be \u201creplacement workforce\u201d, Kearney says that is exactly what will happen. \u201cWe have the most amazing, perverse incentive for that to happen,\u201d she says. Kearney says it will be possible for Coles and Woolworths to take on 300 interns and the government cannot guarantee that it will able to police businesses rorting the scheme. Richard Di Natale is not immune from the charms of Justin Trudeau, it seems, and is modelling himself on the Canadian prime minister. No question at all about that. He has shown, as have many other European examples, that you can have strong progressive values, that you can stand up to those big vested interests. When asked on Lateline if he could end up running the country, Di Natale replied: You just need to look at where the major party vote is and what it\u2019s been doing over a number of decades. Di Natale wants the Greens to have 20% of the vote within a decade. The major party vote has been declining, the growth of the Greens has been continuing year on year on year ... That is the future for Australia. Multi-party government is the future. Keeping us all in the loop at all times Malcolm Turnbull will announce the first big spend of the campaign with $100m for border protection, ABC reports. The funding will go to the Department of Immigration and Border Protection to scrutinise visa applications and minister Peter Dutton is selling it as a policy to help weed out criminals and terrorists before they get to Australia. The day dawns with three stumbles already for candidates \u2013 from being dumped to being dropped down on the Senate ticket \u2013 but with the promise of a new day is the opportunity for the slate to be wiped clean, and for other candidates to have their moment in the spotlight and take the heat from those not exactly basking in it. I\u2019ll be taking you through to 8.30am, when the good and golden Katharine Murphy will be in to drive the blog campaign bus for the rest of the day. The big picture Malcolm Turnbull has been named in the Panama Papers. There is no suggestion of wrongdoing but the Australian Financial Reviews is reporting he was a former director of a British Virgin Islands company set up and administered by the law firm Mossack Fonseca to exploit a Siberian gold prospect. Turnbull joined the board of Star Mining NL with the former New South Wales premier Neville Wran (they had a long and close history with before Wran\u2019s death) in 1993 and two months later the pair were appointed directors of Star Mining\u2019s subsidiary in the British Virgin Islands, Star Technology Services Limited, that held the group\u2019s stake in the Sukhoi Log prospect, a joint venture called LenaGold. Star Mining NL was an Australian-listed company that hoped to develop a $20bn Siberian gold mine called Sukhoi Log. Turnbull\u2019s spokesman told the AFR the prime minister was not aware the company had been administered by Mossack Fonseca as the registered agent in Road Town, Tortola. Turnbull and Wran resigned from the company in 1995. There is no suggestion of wrongdoing on Turnbull\u2019s behalf but the news comes after a messy day on the campaign trail for him. One of the centrepieces of the government\u2019s budget could breach workplace laws with ACTU legal advice finding the intern program, which gives young people an extra $200 a fortnight on top of their welfare payments, not stacking up to minimum wage standards, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. Legal advice sought by the peak union body suggests the PaTH program ... would leave vulnerable interns languishing below the legally enforceable minimum wage and potentially able to sue for recovery of unpaid wages. The National party has faced a conundrum on the campaign trail \u2013 the Liberals\u2019 economic message does not chime with its supporters, so it is abandoning it, the AFR reports. It is avoiding using such phrases as \u2018helping the economy transition away from the mining boom\u2019, because it is further fuelling job insecurity in economically depressed regional and rural electorates. It is especially potent in north Queensland and its mining regions. \u2018That sounds like to a truck driver that he\u2019ll be out of a job and a robot will replace him,\u2019 said one senior National. \u2018Subs and lab coats don\u2019t really speak to the people of north Queensland.\u2019 The Nationals stressed they did not disagree the economy was in transition but felt that the official campaign slogan was insensitive and had not been properly thought through. Meanwhile, Labor is dumping a candidate in Western Australia. Chris Brown may also be expelled from the party after failing to declare two criminal convictions from the 1980s. He pleaded guilty to assaulting a police officer and drink driving but the assault charge was later expunged though he was given a 12-month good behaviour bond. More has come out about Cory Bernardi\u2019s demotion to second on the Senate ticket in South Australia with the Liberal justifying the move by saying Simon Birmingham, the education minister, is the more senior Liberal member and therefore more deserving of the top spot. The move could put Bernardi\u2019s Senate spot at risk with South Australia the weakest performing state for the Liberals in the Senate in 2013 (Birmingham only just scraped in) and Nick Xenophon\u2019s NXT party introducing a new threat, Max Opray reports. On the campaign trail Malcolm Turnbull is heading to Victoria after spending yesterday in western Sydney and his bus will be setting off in Melbourne in the next couple of hours. Bill Shorten has woken up in Townsville for the third morning in a row. Tony Abbott is heading to north Queensland to \u201cgee-up the troops\u201d, according to George Christensen, and then to a \u201cshed meeting and smoko\u201d on a cane farm on Friday. The campaign you should be watching \u201cNot a bellwether but an indicator\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s how the seat of Cowan has been described in Calla Wahlquist\u2019s profile of it. Cowan is held on a margin of 4.5% by the Liberal MP Luke Simpkins, who succeeded Labor\u2019s Graham Edwards in 2007. In the conservative state of WA, it is one of two electorates, along with the new seat of Burt in the city\u2019s south-west, that Labor would have to win to form government. And another thing(s) First Dog on the Moon has created Snitty the Psephological Cassowary\u2019s Vote Compass! for those still deciding how to vote. Michelle Grattan has written that the best outcome for conservative Liberals \u2013 a narrow victory for Turnbull \u2013 would allow Abbott and other conservatives in the party to exercise influence and make Turnbull\u2019s life quite uncomfortable. It\u2019s not like the dark cloud of Kevin Rudd over Julia Gillard in 2013 but Tony Abbott\u2019s shadow is hovering over Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s campaign. The revered Country Women\u2019s Association may join the fight for marriage equality with the Victorian branch set to discuss the subject at its next annual conference after the social issues committee moved a resolution in support of same-sex couples. \u2018Fringe group\u2019 of the day",

Some 85% of the city \u2013 around 25,000 structures \u2013 had been saved. \u201cThe city was surrounded by an ocean of fire only a few days ago,\u201d said Notley. \u201cBut Fort McMurray and the surrounding community have been saved and it will be rebuilt.\u201d</p> <p>But she cautioned: \u201cThat of course doesn\u2019t mean that there aren\u2019t going to be some really heartbreaking images for some people to see when they come back.\u201d</p> <p>The fire has not completely released its grip on the city, said Notley. \u201cThere are smouldering hotspots everywhere. Active fire suppression is continuing.\u201d</p> <p>The wildfire continues to grow in the region, albeit at a much slower pace.

          "bodyText": "Overwhelming and heart-breaking was how Rachel Notley, the Alberta premier, described the destruction left behind in the wake of a wildfire that continues to rage out of control in northern Alberta. \u201cI was very much struck by the power of the devastation of the fire,\u201d Notley said after touring the city of Fort McMurray on Monday. \u201cIt was really quite overwhelming in some spots.\u201d Last week more than 88,000 residents frantically evacuated the oilsands city after shifting winds brought a nearby forest fire to the city\u2019s doorstep. The fire swept through the city in a seemingly random path, leaving behind piles of rubble and twisted metal, burned-out pick-up trucks and charred swing sets in some neighbourhoods. In others, homes sat untouched, their green lawns sharply contrasting with the grey of the city\u2019s worst-hit areas. Some 2,400 homes and buildings were destroyed or damaged by the fire, said Notley. For the tens of thousands of residents now scattered across the province, many of them wondering whether they have a home to return to, Notley had good news. Some 85% of the city \u2013 around 25,000 structures \u2013 had been saved. \u201cThe city was surrounded by an ocean of fire only a few days ago,\u201d said Notley. \u201cBut Fort McMurray and the surrounding community have been saved and it will be rebuilt.\u201d But she cautioned: \u201cThat of course doesn\u2019t mean that there aren\u2019t going to be some really heartbreaking images for some people to see when they come back.\u201d The fire has not completely released its grip on the city, said Notley. \u201cThere are smouldering hotspots everywhere. Active fire suppression is continuing.\u201d The wildfire continues to grow in the region, albeit at a much slower pace. By Monday it had swelled to 204,000 hectares \u2013 an area more than 22 times the size of Manhattan \u2013 but winds were pushing it east, away from communities. It now sits some 25km from the neighbouring province of Saskatchewan. Cooler weather helped crews continue to keep the fire at bay, away from Fort McMurray, Anzac and the Suncor Energy oilsands facility. Currently more than 700 firefighters are battling against the blaze, with another 300 expected to arrive in the area shortly. \u201cThis fire is burning out of control out there, it still is, but we are holding the line where we need to, at least for today,\u201d said Notley. In two weeks officials hope to give the residents a timeline of when they might be able to return to the city. \u201cOne day soon, not as soon as we want, we\u2019ll be able to call this place home again,\u201d said Melissa Blake, the local mayor. As the fire destroyed homes and engulfed neighbourhoods, Darby Allen described it as a \u201cnasty, dirty\u201d fire. On Monday the local fire chief added another adjective to the list: unprecedented. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this,\u201d he said. \u201cMany of the fire conditions and the way the fire behaves, no one\u2019s ever seen anything like this. They\u2019re rewriting their formulas on how fires behave, based on this fire.\u201d Allen singled out a local firefighter who fought the blaze as it consumed his own home and who continued working for another 22 hours, and a colleague who \u2013 with just a handful of people, a flashlight and some phone calls \u2013 managed to evacuate 450 residents in Anzac after the fire caught officials off-guard and swept into the community. \u201cThat is true heroism, ladies and gentlemen,\u201d said Allen. Earlier in the week, officials swiftly moved some 25,000 evacuees north of Fort McMurray to the province\u2019s largest cities in mass airlifts and convoys. On Monday, the first of a different kind of convoy made its way to Edmonton, reuniting owners with the pets left behind during the hurried evacuation. The wildfire forced as much as half of Canada\u2019s oil sands production capacity offline, according to estimates, and is expected to have a significant impact on a country already limping from the drop in the price of oil. On Tuesday the Alberta government will meet with meet key players in the province\u2019s energy sector to assess the extent of the impact and get a sense of how long production could be disrupted.

          "bodyText": "More than 88,000 people have left wildfire-ravaged Fort McMurray in western Canada, as authorities warned the blaze could double in size by the end of Saturday. Police and military oversaw the procession of hundreds of cars and a mass airlift of evacuees as flames and smoke continued to play havoc with efforts to get to safety. Residents were ordered to evacuate on Tuesday after the fires breached city limits. Most went south, but about 25,000 were directed north, spending the past three days stranded in oil sands work camps, their supplies dwindling as the wildfires grew tenfold. Wary of the fires\u2019 unpredictable spread, officials decided to move them south, where they could better access support services. Led by Royal Canadian Mounted Police cruisers and monitored overhead by helicopters, the convoy took residents through the remains of their city where flames engulfed neighbourhoods and destroyed at least 1,600 homes and other buildings. About 1,200 vehicles had passed through Fort McMurray by late afternoon on Friday, despite a one-hour interruption due to heavy smoke, authorities said. One resident Jim Dunstan was in the convoy with his wife, Tracy, and two young sons. \u201cIt was shocking to see the damaged cars all burned on the side of the road. It made you feel lucky to get out of there,\u201d he said. The extent of the destruction was evident in a video uploaded to YouTube on Thursday. Apparently shot by a firefighter, the footage shows a devastated landscape dotted with piles of blackened rubble and the burned-out skeletons of pickup trucks. A thick haze of smoke still hangs above the scene, while small fires flare among the ruins One of the firefighters can be heard to say: \u201cCrazy. A whole neighbourhood just lost last night.\u201d Some of the evacuees stranded in the north were also evacuated by plane, with thousands of residents flown to Alberta\u2019s major cities in a series of mass airlifts that began on Thursday. In Edmonton, between 4,500 and 5,000 evacuees arrived at the airport on at least 45 flights on Friday, according to airport spokesman Chris Chodan. In total, more than 300 flights have arrived with evacuees since Tuesday, he said. Alberta remains in a state of emergency. More than 1,100 firefighters, 145 helicopters, 138 pieces of heavy equipment and 22 air tankers were fighting a total of 49 wildfires across the province, with seven considered to be raging out of control. In Fort McMurray, the heart of Alberta\u2019s oil sands region, firefighters were still working to save the city\u2019s homes and businesses \u201cThe beast is still up,\u201d the local fire chief, Darby Allen, said on Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s surrounding the city and we\u2019re here doing our very best for you.\u201d The evacuation has forced as much as a quarter of Canada\u2019s oil output offline according to estimates and is expect to impact on a country already hurt by the dramatic fall in the price of oil Justin Trudeau, Canada\u2019s prime minister, described the week\u2019s harrowing events as the largest fire evacuation in Alberta\u2019s history. The images emerging from Fort McMurray looked \u201clike a war-torn corner of the world instead of our own backyard\u201d, he said. \u201cHomes have been destroyed. Neighbourhoods have gone up in flames,\u201d he added. \u201cThe footage we\u2019ve seen of cars racing down highways while fire races on all sides is nothing short of terrifying.\u201d Unseasonably hot temperatures, extremely dry conditions and winds of up to 70km/h (44 mph) helped fuel the fire\u2019s spectacular growth to 101,000 hectares \u2013 an area more than 10 times the size of Manhattan, and up from just 10,000 hectares earlier in the week. With temperatures expected to hit 27C (80F) on Saturday, officials said the fire could double in size by end of that day. Officials said at this point that a change in the weather offers the only possible hope of halting the fire. \u201cLet me be clear: air tankers are not going to stop this fire,\u201d said Chad Morrison, Alberta\u2019s manager of wildfire prevention. \u201cIt is going to continue to push through these dry conditions until we actually get some significant rain.\u201d Environment Canada said it could be Sunday before a 40% chance of rain is expected in the area. Winds helped to shift the fire south-east and away from Fort McMurray on Thursday. The change in direction, however, put the nearby communities of Anzac and Gregoire Lake Estates \u201cunder extreme threat\u201d. The cause of the fire remains under investigation.

Officials said the fire would likely continue to grow in the coming days, but noted it seemed to be heading away from the community, which lies in the heart of Canada\u2019s oil sands.</p> <p>It was too early to say whether the change in direction would lessen the threat posed by the fire, said Chad Morrison with AB Wildfire. \u201cThis is an extreme wildfire event and we expect to see continued extreme wildfire behavior over the coming days,\u201d he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2016/may/04/wildfires-in-canada-force-evacuation-of-fort-mcmurray-in-pictures\">Wildfires in Canada force evacuation of Fort McMurray \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Firefighting efforts have so far been focused on protecting key infrastructure in the area, such as the water treatment plant, the hospital and the airport. Crews had also begun dropping water and retardant from the air on Wednesday in order to protect homes in residential areas. Four air tankers from Quebec were expected to arrive in the area on Thursday, and 100 firefighters were headed to northern Alberta from Ontario.</p> <p>But according to Morrison, the only hope of stopping the fire soon is a change in the weather. \u201cLet me be clear, air tankers are not going to stop this fire,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is an extreme fire event. It\u2019s going to continue to push through these dry conditions until we actually get some significant rain to help us.\u201d</p> <p>While temperatures in the area dropped considerably on Thursday, the wildfire was expected to continue to challenge firefighters. \u201cWe\u2019re still going to have very low humidity and the conditions are still tinder-dry,\u201d Morrison said.</p> <p>The challenge was heightened as the fire \u2013 described as a \u201cmulti-headed monster\u201d by Fort McMurray\u2019s mayor \u2013 was now creating its own meteorological conditions. \u201cIt had begun to create its own weather, creating its own high winds yesterday and even lightning was coming from the smoke clouds that it created,\u201d said Morrison.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e1715b730b705a5ea8691352c9ecdf5db353b2b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e1715b730b705a5ea8691352c9ecdf5db353b2b4/0_474_3411_2046/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alberta officers conduct search, rescue and evacuation efforts as they respond to wildfires in Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada on Wednesday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alberta officers conduct search, rescue and evacuation efforts as they respond to wildfires in Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada on Wednesday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The cause of the fire remains under investigation.</p> <p>Mike Flannigan, a professor who studies wildland fire at the Edmonton\u2019s University of Alberta, described the fire as a crown fire, which occurs when the tops of conifers carry the flames through the canopy. \u201cThat\u2019s when you start to see the 100-metre-high flames,\u201d he told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.</p> <p>The fire, he estimated, could be moving as fast as 5km/hour, likely with a fire front \u2013 the area where the fire is burning most intensely \u2013 so hot that the fire crews are unable to confront the fire head-on.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/04/have-you-been-affected-by-the-alberta-wildfires\">Have you been affected by the Alberta wildfires?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s burning so hot that air drops are like spitting on a campfire. Water and retardant might slow it down, but probably not much,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Officials said they would begin moving the 25,000 people who had taken shelter in oilsands work camps north of the city to Edmonton, with the hope of securing better support services for them. About 8,000 people were expected to be flown out on Thursday, while the rest would have to wait until fuel reserves were refilled and the opening of a main highway to drive themselves south.</p> <p>Athabasca Oil said on Thursday that rapidly advancing fires in the south of the city were behind its decision to shut down its Hangingstone oilsands project and evacuate all personnel. In a statement, the company estimated that the fire front was just 5km away from its facility. </p> <p>Justin Trudeau, Canada\u2019s prime minister, described the week\u2019s harrowing events as the largest fire evacuation in Alberta\u2019s history.</p> <p>\u201cHomes have been destroyed. Neighbourhoods have gone up in flames. The footage we\u2019ve seen of cars racing down highways while fire races on all sides is nothing short of terrifying,\u201d he said. The Alberta community looked \u201clike a war-torn corner of the world instead of our own backyard,\u201d he added.</p> <p>Some 48 hours after they were ordered out of their homes and their community, some residents were questioning how the evacuation was handled and pointing to the thick plumes of smoke that had loomed over the city in the days leading up to the orders.</p> <p>Ash - including red-hot fragments \u2013 had been raining down for days, said Crystal Mercredi. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f0bd09cbd408472e9f5083d6d5ff04870fee5ee2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0bd09cbd408472e9f5083d6d5ff04870fee5ee2/0_12_3606_2163/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Canadian armed force members speak with displaced residents from the Fort McMurray area in Anzac, Alberta, Canada, on Wednesday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Canadian armed force members speak with displaced residents from the Fort McMurray area in Anzac, Alberta, Canada, on Wednesday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe evacuation came too late,\u201d she said. As evacuees waited in gridlocked traffic on the only major route leading out of the city, they called into the radio station to voice their fears about the rapidly approaching flames. \u201cThey were saying we\u2019re bumper to bumper and we can\u2019t move. We\u2019re trapped, we\u2019re sitting ducks.\u201d It took her husband 3.5 hours to make it five kilometres out of their neighbourhood.</p> <p>Despite the raining ash and smoke, schools had continued as usual, leaving school buses packed with children among the vehicles on the road as evacuees struggled to flee to safety through the smoke that blanketed the city. \u201cMy nephew got out of that school an hour before it burned down,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Speaking on Thursday, Notley said it was unclear if the evacuation could have gone any better, given that more than 80,000 people were cleared out of a city with just two roads leading in and out within the span of 48 hours.</p> <p>Mercredi and her family eventually made it to the nearby community of Lac La Biche, where they took shelter in a home with 54 other evacuees.

          "bodyText": "When she spotted a small circle of orange flames flickering in the trees outside, Erica Decker knew she had just minutes left in the house she had always described as her dream home. With little more than their cats and the clothes on their backs, she and her family jumped in the car to flee the rapidly advancing wildfire. \u201cAs we pulled out of the driveway, we could see the flames reaching our front lawn,\u201d said Decker, her voice shaking as she fought back tears. \u201cWe knew we wouldn\u2019t have anything to go back to.\u201d Walls of flames flanked the road as they made their way out of the northern Alberta city of Fort McMurray. \u201cIt was something out of a movie,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cIt was absolutely apocalyptic, there were vehicles stranded everywhere, the sky was black and orange, there were \u2013 and are still \u2013 so many people trapped.\u201d They made it to Edmonton. On their first night, her two-year-old daughter kept asking for her own bed and her toys. \u201cThere was nothing we could for her,\u201d she said. \u201cIts unbelievably hard to watch a child go through that and do not understand why they can\u2019t have the things they want.\u201d Soon after, her worst fears were confirmed. Images from Fort McMurray showed an empty space where her home once stood, the scorched front steps the only trace of the bay-windowed house. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything for me to return for,\u201d she said. Her neighbourhood, Beacon Hill, was among the first to be swallowed by the fire. The building where she worked also burned to the ground. \u201cI don\u2019t have a home, I don\u2019t have a job. Our community, it doesn\u2019t exist anymore. It\u2019s gone. We\u2019re not even sure if there is going to be a city to return to.\u201d On Thursday, the wildfire continued its path of destruction through northern Alberta, growing more than eight times in size as it reduced homes to rubble and engulfed entire neighbourhoods. \u201cWe have a very difficult road ahead, with a lot of uncertainty as these fires continue to burn,\u201d Rachel Notley, the premier of Alberta, said on Thursday. Unseasonably hot temperatures, extremely dry conditions and winds of up to 70km/h, helped fuel the fire\u2019s spectacular growth to 85,000 hectares - up from just 10,000 hectares the day before. On Wednesday, Notley had estimated that some 1600 structures had already been destroyed by the fire. So far there have been no direct injuries or deaths from the fire. An air tanker that was battling the blaze slid off the runway as it was landing on Thursday, but there were no fatalities. The two pilots on-board were being assessed for any injuries. Alberta remained in a state of emergency on Thursday, with the communities of Anzac, Gregoire Lake Estates and Fort McMurray First Nation evacuated in the early hours of Thursday after the wildfires spread south. The blaze continued to burn in Fort McMurray, consuming homes and threatening several other neighbourhoods, while the emergency operations centre relocated three times in one day as it sought to duck out of the path of the fire. Officials said more than 1,110 firefighters, 145 helicopters, 138 pieces of heavy equipment and 22 air tankers were fighting 49 wildfires in the province, with seven of the wildfires considered to be raging out of control. Officials said the fire would likely continue to grow in the coming days, but noted it seemed to be heading away from the community, which lies in the heart of Canada\u2019s oil sands. It was too early to say whether the change in direction would lessen the threat posed by the fire, said Chad Morrison with AB Wildfire. \u201cThis is an extreme wildfire event and we expect to see continued extreme wildfire behavior over the coming days,\u201d he said. Firefighting efforts have so far been focused on protecting key infrastructure in the area, such as the water treatment plant, the hospital and the airport. Crews had also begun dropping water and retardant from the air on Wednesday in order to protect homes in residential areas. Four air tankers from Quebec were expected to arrive in the area on Thursday, and 100 firefighters were headed to northern Alberta from Ontario. But according to Morrison, the only hope of stopping the fire soon is a change in the weather. \u201cLet me be clear, air tankers are not going to stop this fire,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is an extreme fire event. It\u2019s going to continue to push through these dry conditions until we actually get some significant rain to help us.\u201d While temperatures in the area dropped considerably on Thursday, the wildfire was expected to continue to challenge firefighters. \u201cWe\u2019re still going to have very low humidity and the conditions are still tinder-dry,\u201d Morrison said. The challenge was heightened as the fire \u2013 described as a \u201cmulti-headed monster\u201d by Fort McMurray\u2019s mayor \u2013 was now creating its own meteorological conditions. \u201cIt had begun to create its own weather, creating its own high winds yesterday and even lightning was coming from the smoke clouds that it created,\u201d said Morrison. The cause of the fire remains under investigation. Mike Flannigan, a professor who studies wildland fire at the Edmonton\u2019s University of Alberta, described the fire as a crown fire, which occurs when the tops of conifers carry the flames through the canopy. \u201cThat\u2019s when you start to see the 100-metre-high flames,\u201d he told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. The fire, he estimated, could be moving as fast as 5km/hour, likely with a fire front \u2013 the area where the fire is burning most intensely \u2013 so hot that the fire crews are unable to confront the fire head-on. \u201cIt\u2019s burning so hot that air drops are like spitting on a campfire. Water and retardant might slow it down, but probably not much,\u201d he said. Officials said they would begin moving the 25,000 people who had taken shelter in oilsands work camps north of the city to Edmonton, with the hope of securing better support services for them. About 8,000 people were expected to be flown out on Thursday, while the rest would have to wait until fuel reserves were refilled and the opening of a main highway to drive themselves south. Athabasca Oil said on Thursday that rapidly advancing fires in the south of the city were behind its decision to shut down its Hangingstone oilsands project and evacuate all personnel. In a statement, the company estimated that the fire front was just 5km away from its facility. Justin Trudeau, Canada\u2019s prime minister, described the week\u2019s harrowing events as the largest fire evacuation in Alberta\u2019s history. \u201cHomes have been destroyed. Neighbourhoods have gone up in flames. The footage we\u2019ve seen of cars racing down highways while fire races on all sides is nothing short of terrifying,\u201d he said. The Alberta community looked \u201clike a war-torn corner of the world instead of our own backyard,\u201d he added. Some 48 hours after they were ordered out of their homes and their community, some residents were questioning how the evacuation was handled and pointing to the thick plumes of smoke that had loomed over the city in the days leading up to the orders. Ash - including red-hot fragments \u2013 had been raining down for days, said Crystal Mercredi. \u201cThe evacuation came too late,\u201d she said. As evacuees waited in gridlocked traffic on the only major route leading out of the city, they called into the radio station to voice their fears about the rapidly approaching flames. \u201cThey were saying we\u2019re bumper to bumper and we can\u2019t move. We\u2019re trapped, we\u2019re sitting ducks.\u201d It took her husband 3.5 hours to make it five kilometres out of their neighbourhood. Despite the raining ash and smoke, schools had continued as usual, leaving school buses packed with children among the vehicles on the road as evacuees struggled to flee to safety through the smoke that blanketed the city. \u201cMy nephew got out of that school an hour before it burned down,\u201d she said. Speaking on Thursday, Notley said it was unclear if the evacuation could have gone any better, given that more than 80,000 people were cleared out of a city with just two roads leading in and out within the span of 48 hours. Mercredi and her family eventually made it to the nearby community of Lac La Biche, where they took shelter in a home with 54 other evacuees. By Thursday, the number had dwindled to around 30 people, as well as two cats and nine dogs. Many worried about those left behind. Mercredi\u2019s father-in-law opted to stay behind and fight the fire with a team of friends, hoping to save the helicopter hangar he owns. On Wednesday night they bulldozed the trees near the hangar, in hopes of staving off the blaze. For the tens of thousands of evacuees now stranded hundreds of kilometres from their homes with no timeline on when they might be able to head back, all they can do is track the fire\u2019s progress, anxiously scanning any image of Fort McMurray for signs of what might lie ahead for them and their community. Evacuee Tamara Wolfe got a glimpse on Wednesday night, as she stayed with friends in Edmonton. A photo of her neighbourhood revealed that her home had been one of the many consumed by the fire. \u201cAll that\u2019s left of our home is our chain link fence that went around the yard,\u201d she said. It was the lowest point in a week that saw her and her family travel more than 20 hours \u2013 first north and then south \u2013 in search of refuge from the looming fires. \u201cThat was my breaking point. I dropped to the ground and just let it out,\u201d said the 43-year-old. Running on just a few hours of sleep and with her mind racing constantly, the coming days will be key to what\u2019s next for her and her family. \u201cThis isn\u2019t over. It\u2019s far from over,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is historical \u2013 there are 88,000 people who have left fort McMurray and that fire has not slowed down. And we don\u2019t know much of the city is going to be left at the end of it.\u201d",

          "bodyText": "The Canadian province of Alberta has declared a state of emergency after a raging wildfire destroyed dozens of homes, engulfed several neighbourhoods and forced the hurried evacuation of the entire city of Fort McMurray. More than 80,000 residents were ordered to leave the northern Alberta city after shifting winds saw the blaze go from being largely controlled to a \u201cnasty, ugly\u201d inferno as described by the local fire chief. By Wednesday more than 250 firefighters were fighting the fire, assisted by helicopters and air tankers. Officials estimated that 1,600 structures had been damaged or destroyed by Wednesday night. As flames fanned south on Thursday, officials also issued mandatory evacuation orders for the Anzac, Gregoire Lake Estates and Fort McMurray First Nation communities located about 50km south of Fort McMurray. After the evacuation order was issued, residents scrambling to make their way out of Fort McMurray sat in bumper-to-bumper traffic on the main road, struggling to see the road through the thick grey haze that blanketed the highway. Flames licked the road and ash rained down on vehicles, while air tankers and helicopters flew overhead. Gas pumps soon ran dry, leaving many residents stranded on the highway overnight. \u201c[With] the heat from the oncoming smoke and the flames, you could see mini-tornadoes forming near the road,\u201d resident Jordan Stuffco told the Canadian Press. \u201cIt was something out of an apocalyptic movie.\u201d Authorities warned that the fire, which started on Sunday, was being fanned by hot, dry and windy weather. \u201cThe worst of the fire is not over,\u201d said Bernie Schmitte of Alberta Agriculture and Forestry. \u201cWe\u2019re still faced with very high temperatures, low relative humidity and some strong winds.\u201d Hours later the raging inferno forced authorities to declare a state of emergency. The province\u2019s municipal affairs minister, Danielle Larivee, said the declaration would allow the province to better access external resources. An accident on a nearby highway between an SUV and a tractor-trailer unit had resulted in fatalities and sparked an additional fire, added Larivee. It was not immediately clear if the accident was related to the evacuation. The driver and passenger of the SUV died on the scene. Officials said the fire had grown from about 1,200 hectares to span more than 10,000 hectares within two days. \u201cWe had a devastating day yesterday and we are preparing for a bad day today,\u201d local fire chief Darby Allen said. He described the wildfire as a \u201cnasty, dirty fire\u201d that was raging out of control, that defied efforts to suppress it. \u201cThere are areas of the city that have not been burned, but this fire will look for them and it will find them, and it will try and take them.\u201d On Tuesday 105 patients and clients \u2013 including nine newborn babies \u2013 were evacuated from city\u2019s only hospital as flames approached. With Fort McMurray the hub of the province\u2019s main oil sands region, a number of oil sands work camps nearby were turned into impromptu housing for evacuees. Neighbouring communities also reached out to residents as they fled the flames, staffing recreation centres to provide shelter and bringing gas to stranded motorists. Others made their way to the evacuation camps that had been set up outside the city or found lodging in the city of Edmonton, some 435km away, where they took stock of what they had left behind. \u201cWhen you leave \u2026 it\u2019s an overwhelming feeling to think that you\u2019ll never see your house again,\u201d Carol Christian told the Canadian Press.

          "body": "<p>Canada\u2019s prime minister is no ordinary politician \u2013 Justin Trudeau has been pictured balancing babies with one hand, dancing to bhangra music, and showing off his yoga skills. He\u2019s also made headlines with his bold views on <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-legalizing-pot-global-treaties-1.3390745\">everything from drugs</a>, to <a href=\"https://www.liberal.ca/petitions/support-justin-trudeaus-bold-plan-to-fight-climate-change/\">climate change</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/mar/17/justin-trudeau-im-going-to-keep-calling-myself-a-feminist-video\">feminism</a>. But, as the world looks on in wonder, how do people feel in Canada? Six months after he was sworn into office, we asked Canadians to tell us how they think Trudeau is faring. </p> <h2>The mood six months on</h2> <p>On 4 November 2015, Trudeau took office, after nine years of Stephen Harper\u2019s leadership. Harper was known, among other things, for his contempt for the public\u2019s right to know about his government\u2019s activities, insisting that he choose who got to ask the questions at press conferences.</p> <p>One of the biggest changes since he was voted out, according to those who responded, is that government is now much more open. Bobbie Jean Huff, 70, from Ontario summed it up saying: \u201cTrudeau\u2019s not a tyrant like Harper. There\u2019s a new openness in the air. It\u2019s refreshing.\u201d</p> <p>Barbara Densmore, 59, from Vancouver Island, says: \u201cJustin has brought a level of intention, authenticity, openness, thoughtfulness and forward thinking that I\u2019ve never before seen.\u201d She adds: \u201cI think the mood has changed for the more progressive thinkers in the country. It\u2019s like having a light switched on after almost a decade of darkness. But there are a lot of people who are still having time adjusting to the light.\u201d<br></p> <p>Trudeau\u2019s global outlook has also been a game-changer. Vicky, 29, from Toronto says: \u201cHe is bringing international attention to our country ... He won\u2019t do everything he set out to do, but he is making a great effort to come out of the gate swinging on all his campaign promises.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e988d07cb6eab27b5880cc1cd4285855dc4f89fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e988d07cb6eab27b5880cc1cd4285855dc4f89fe/0_76_2093_1255/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Justin Trudeau and prince harry\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018He is bringing international attention to our country.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Jackson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sean, 24, from Toronto agreed: \u201cThe tone of government has changed a lot. People are more optimistic as the government responds more to concerns of everyday Canadians and takes on a more positive role internationally.\u201d</p> <p>There was general recognition that he is reinvigorating interest in the political process. Colin Mitchell, 18, from Vancouver says:\u201cHis emphasis on young people has truly reengaged a large segment of Canadian society. After nearly a decade of neglect, our current government has a demonstrated interest in the future of Canada.\u201d</p> <h2>The policies</h2> <p>Although he\u2019s only been in office for six month, many Canadians have been watching to see which policies he will stick to, and which ones he may abandon.<br></p> <p>We heard from a lot of people who praised how he has handled the global refugee crisis. Christian, 20 from Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, says: \u201cThe acceptance of over 25,000 refugees was very popular and showed the Liberals intended to keep their promises. The gender parity in his cabinet was also extremely popular, as were his views on feminism as expressed at the World Economic Forum in Davos.\u201d<br></p> <p>Sue G, 55, from Ottawa agreed: \u201cBy welcoming Syrian refugees, Trudeau has reaffirmed the role of Canada as a humanitarian nation \u2013 and has refuted the myth that Muslims are terrorists.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4ac6555424d6a8cfc53c47d7966833993d68c45d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ac6555424d6a8cfc53c47d7966833993d68c45d/0_152_4254_2552/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Canada\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, left, greets Georgina Zires, center, Madeleine Jamkossian, second right, and her father Kevork Jamkossian, refugees fleeing from Syria, as they arrive in Toronto.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nathan Denette/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There was also a lot of support for his work to integrate indigenous communities in the country. One way he is doing this is by launching a national public inquiry into <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/17/missing-and-murdered-indigenous-women-in-canada-could-number-4000\">missing and murdered indigenous women</a>. Trudeau also said his government would make significant investments in education <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/justin-trudeau-afn-indigenous-aboriginal-people-1.3354747\">and lift the 2% cap on funding for First Nations programs</a>.</p> <p>Dave T, 60, from Southern Ontario says: \u201cThe one policy change that is probably most significant would be the restoration of relations between Canada\u2019s government and the indigenous people. Imagine my horror to learn that successive governments for over 150 years were engaged in systemic cultural genocide. To now have a government that has made it central to their mandate to respect and include these severely marginalised people in the decision making process will have a significant impact on Canada\u2019s social fabric for many generations to come.\u201d<br></p> <p>However, Trudeau\u2019s policies sometimes appear to be in conflict and many criticised his lack of action on bill C-51, the anti-terrorism law passed by the former Conservative government in the spring following homegrown attacks in Quebec and Ottawa.</p> <p>Anonymous, 46, from Vancouver says: \u201cThe mood was pretty giddy just after the election, and his cabinet selections solidified that. But we\u2019re still waiting for actual significant policy \u2013 C-51 is still the law, we still have first past the post for voting, and the time to change that before the next election is getting short. Trade deals and pipelines still lumber along. It\u2019s still business as usual in most respects, which is not what I expected. I know it takes time to change things, but I would have liked to have seen at least one significant piece of legislation by now.\u201d</p> <p>Not blocking sales of arms to Saudi Arabia also proved unpopular. Guillaume Gervais, 32, from Toronto says: \u201cHe disagrees that \u2018honour killings,\u2019 female genital mutilation, forced marriage or other gender-based violence\u201d are barbaric. They are just a different cultural practices for him. His thumbs-up for the sale of $15bn of weaponry to the Islamic State of Saudi Arabia is also outrageous and humiliating for Canadians.\u201d<br></p> <p>Gervais adds that on the positive side, the last budget his team proposed seems promising. \u201cCanada\u2019s infrastructure are deficient and are not keeping up with economic and demographic growth. His team doctor-assisted death legislation is also promising. It mostly leaves behind opinions from backward ideologies on the subject and focuses on the patient.\u201d</p> <h2>A case of good public relations </h2> <p>Many of those who responded had their concerns that Trudeau was all talk \u2013 and great PR \u2013 but no action. \u201cHis team looks well prepared to manage him. He\u2019s a poster boy with very little life experience. He never really had a job before jumping into politics a few years ago. Overall, Justin is a pretty good actor backed by a very well oiled PR machine,\u201d says Gervais.</p> <p>Anonymous, 46, from Toronto says: \u201cHe looks good but Canadians were looking for more than a change of clothes: they were looking for a whole different wardrobe. Instead it\u2019s like the same elite wealthy people are running things the way they always did. And it\u2019s really disappointing.\u201d</p> <p>However, others said that rhetoric in itself \u2013 even without action \u2013 can be powerful: \u201cThe best thing he has done for our country is his rhetoric. He has promoted respect for aboriginal peoples, acceptance of refugees and other cultures, the importance of multilateralism and humanitarianism ... Even without concrete policy, his rhetoric has resulted in a paradigm shift in the Canadian public on many key issues.\u201d</p> <h2>Jury is still out</h2> <p>While it\u2019s still really too soon to tell whether Trudeau will live up to the expectations, many people are now waiting to see what will happen in coming months. Peter Jakubiak, 36, from Ottawa, summed up the mood perfectly: \u201cHis policy ideas will face greater scrutiny as they are further rolled out and tested over time. So far his government seems open to input, committed to putting in the work, and not too proud to change or adapt course in response to criticism. This seems a fairly promising beginning to what will surely become a less forgiving general reception.\u201d</p>",
